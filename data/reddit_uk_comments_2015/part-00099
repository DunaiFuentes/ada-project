Giving up easy balls, holding up play to get stripped, going for glory instead of playing your role. I mean come on. We paid 30 million for his services. Offloading a lot in the process too. We SHOULD expect positive performances in return. So far, he's playing like he's worth 15m.

We are quick to ridicule, which should change. But to some extent, I think Cuadrado's judgment is justified. 

EDIT: 

I'd also like to add, this situation isn't comparable to KDB's. We got KDB for cheap, and he didn't preform so we sold him for like double his transfer price. He happened to improve after selling, which is a shame but it happens. It's not like we got bested out of anything, it's just unfortunate he didn't get to work out with us. 

In this situation we paid 30 million (kind of expensive) for him, got rid of our 2nd best winger IMHO (hate me for it, idc, it's my honest opinion), AND also loaned ACF Salah (which may or may not be a potential sell). All for this one player who isn't even playing any better than Salah would be doing. Like I said before, he is playing like he's worth 15 million.

Don't know why people have the expectations that everybody is going to fit in right away and be amazing, if not they're shit and a waste of money. I'm seeing the same things with Cudarado that I've seen with Schurrle and Salah: get limited minutes, go for glory to try to get a fucking important start, end up playing poorly due to lack of form and stay benched. Maybe people should place the blame on the lack of rotation instead of the players if all 3 players deemed to be Willian's backup at RM/RW have been poor. Players need to get a string of games starting to get back to form, not get limited minutes as sub or starts against clear underdogs. 

I swear anybody who wasn't a starter the beginning of this season hasn't a fair chance. Luis? Never gets a chance to play with Dave (a fullback pairing which I think would be perfect but we've seen like maybe once?) when Ivanovic has given up so many goals this season despite his effectiveness going forward.

Teams watch clips in preparation for a game and knowing he is confident to go either way would be a massive advantage to Andros. I think it was a poor choice to take him off when we did yesterday. He wasn't having a good game, but then nobody was and he hardly ever got the ball. Taking him off meant we had no width and it played right into their hands.

I'd probably say Lamela is the more one dimensional player. The majority of the time he brings the pace of an attack to a grinding halt as he tries to skip around defenders. Even when he does get past his man, he then proceeds to slow right down again to try and beat the next, and inevitably gets crowded out or gets tackled from behind. He has bags of ability but he's rarely that creative. He offers no width at all, and is regularly wasteful when he gets into good positions. The amount of times I've seen him throw a few pointless step overs whilst standing still and then just chipping the ball into the box without looking is ridiculous. 

I really feel as though Townsend provides more problems for the opposition. He is naturally wider even on the right. He has very decent pace, so is always a threat in behind. I feel as though we should look to play him on the left more. If he carries on improving the way he is and if he is consistently confident in his right foot, then he could be a real threat to a right back who wouldn't know which way to show him.

It's only a viable strategy for clubs at the bottom of the table because staying where they are (i.e. not getting relegated) is their aim. 

For me Brendan had quality last season that I haven't seen since perhaps Rafa. There were a number of times injuries had threatened to curtail our form (Sturridge, Lucas) but BR thought a way out of it. His substitutions also won us a number of games, something Rafa was shit at. 

Basically, I expected that we would be crap for at least the beginning third of the season. No way in hell did I expect to be in another title race and if anyone did, I'm sorry but they need a reality check. Buying so many players, bedding them in at a club with much higher expectations than where they've come from. Losing your talisman and then Sturridge for half a season.

For the first point, I can understand that feeling. But when you're looking at paying rent on 75% of the property anyway, as well as the mortgage interest payment... Is the loss of flexibility, the cost of purchasing in your time and solicitors fees, and the limitation in your mobility (at a time key in defining your career), really worth that tiny bit of money that will go towards ownership of that property? Perhaps you could invest that money in another way?

For the second point. The bad news is you have already been priced out of the market. ""Surely a graduate with a skill in high demand, in the best paid part of the uk, in a huge city can afford his own place?"" You ask. ""What could I possibly have gotten wrong?""

If IP start to store MAC addresses which are more akin to a device's fingerprint, people are just going to spoof them, so ISP's are going to get a list of ""made up Mac"" + ""random IP address"", which is going to be fairly useless really. 

I also have two wireless networks in the house.  One secured and one open.  Anybody can use the open one. I got pissed off having to tell my kids and their friends what the wifi password was so just added an unsecured point with throttled bandwidth.

Add this to the fact its fairly simple to break most domestic wifi security anyway so someone with evil intent is just going to sit in their car outside and use YOUR connection anyway, all you are doing is asking ISP's to store a mass of irrelevant data at their expense.

&gt;Despite QPR being members of the Football League since 1920, the two sides did not meet in a competitive match until [1968–69](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968%E2%80%9369_in_English_football), when Rangers made their debut in the First Division. Their first match took place on 14 September 1968; Chelsea won 4–0. Since then, the sides have met a further 45 times, making it the most common West London derby since the 1960s. The clubs developed a rivalry in the 1960s and 1970s when both were playing top-flight football and competing to be among London's top sides, with Chelsea winning the FA Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and League Cup, and Rangers winning the League Cup and finishing as league runners-up by a single point.

United in the first half bypassed the high press by keeping their defence spread very wide and using Carrick to drift into space everywhere, high up or deep or as a third centreback, assisted by Herrera in a similar but much less effective role. They played Fellaini off the attacking central midfielder (Mason), leaving Bentaleb to cover nobody at all on the other side and pulling Mason slightly deeper into an ineffective no-man’s land where he couldn’t affect the play higher up but wasn’t sat in front of Dier where Fellaini was having an orgy. Walker stayed wide to deal with Young, leaving a massive gap in that part of the pitch where Fellaini was playing, and they hit Fellaini again and again and again and again. Tactical move one: we brought on Dembele to move Chadli out wide and solidify the central midfield a bit, but this only really affected the high press, when the press was failing deep and especially on the right, where Dier, Walker and Mason were all leaving the triangle for Fellaini to work in.


Second half, tactical move two: Pochettino told Bentaleb (the deeper midfielder) to basically mark Fellaini. This finally allowed us to get a handle on him (and sort of Mata), and also freed up Mason to move further forward with Dembele, allowing a more effective press on Carrick and Herrera and making it finally an even game (albeit one where a shell-shocked Spurs side had no way of getting back into the match).

For me, Carrick’s roaming regista role and Fellaini’s placement into a no-man’s land of Spurs defence was absolutely devastating, and it took us 45 minutes to adapt.

Having said that, United have NEVER played this style in any previous match; their tempo was much faster, they had much better movement, spread the play a lot wider, played Rooney up front and looked like an actual football team. If a team has made a plan to specifically change their entire team to beat you, it’s going to be a tough day no matter how good you are, and Spurs just aren’t quite there yet.


Today was a day for a Bentaleb-Sandro/Schneiderlin pivot. A Dembele-Sandro maybe. But still, it’s a young side and there’s games yet to come. Finish as high as you can.

liverpool have an identity - a style of play that we are familiar with, and can beat teams with. i haven't seen a united identity since fergie left. 

sure we didn't play well against blackburn, and there arent any excuses for a pretty dull and tired performance. but this game against utd, no matter how tired the players could possibly be, is crucial, so we will be playing with as much as energy as we have. 

as for utd being on a roll... so are we? only unbeaten team in 2015... so thats that. defensively, utd are pretty bad, just lucky to have de gea. midfield is all over the place, i dont even know what to say. and your attack is so unpredictable - somtimes players shine, sometimes they dont.

To add to that most immigrants who come here already have a job lined up, and there is no guarantee that there will be a private school in the area, which would restrict where immigrants are able to live. And because of that immigrants would end up crowding around areas with private schools, which results in the kind of closed off communities that (as far as I am concerned) are the cause of most of the problems this country has with immigrants in the first place.

I think there is also something in that human rights treaty that guarantees people a right to education, and it sounds like this idea would be in violation of that.

You also need to put houses in those same streets.  People who live 50 yards from a high street will not bother with a car, they'll just shop locally.

As for access by car, well I think that's something of a red herring.  It's access full stop that's the issue, we should be prioritising access to high streets for pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and lastly the motorist.

Traditionally nuclear power plants have a dual containment system. A thick reinforced concrete vault, which is itself inside a heavy concrete building. 


The Toshiba AP1000 plant planned for Moorside uses a single heavy steel containment inside a concrete chimney. This allows the outer skin of the steel containment building to be open to the elements, so that in the event of total reactor cooling system failure, the heat can escape through the steel walls with no need for pumps,  batteries or electrical power. The concrete ""chimney""  building helps encourage air flow around the building under total cooling system failure conditions. This is unlike previous generations of reactors or other reactors planned for new build (Areva EPR @ Hinckley point, and Hitachi ABWR @ Wylfa) which require electrical power or external pumps to provide reactor cooling at all times, and if this is interrupted, meltdown would occur within 24 hours. The AP1000 is unique in that the reactor is self-cooling under emergency conditions. 


Gunderson is claiming that in the event of a hole in the main containment developed, there would be no secondary containment to trap the radioactive materials released in the event of a catastrophic meltdown. 

He argues that there have been containment failures in the past, and that the steel design is new without any industry experience in its inspection and maintenance.  It's a fair point but the article is scaremongering a bit.

Sorry but that's just wrong.

Let's look at it this way:

Sales: £1,000

Cost of Sales: £500

Gross Profit: £500

Operating Costs: £300

Net Profit: £200

That is £200 at the end of the year that hasn't been used. If your owner was ""investing profits into growing the company"" that operating cost would be £200 higher and your profit would be £0.

I've looked at the financial records for a few small companies and what you'll generally find is that the owners will pay themselves a wage, pay their staff a wage, invest whatever money they feel they need to, and then whatever is left over will be paid out as dividends (usually among the owner and their spouse, to ease tax burdens).

My first priority would be to is max out the isa's every year - get 85k in each separate bank( iirc there's 5 of them). The interest rates here are awful BUT the money is government backed - so you can basically never lose it. this will take a while with the 15k limit per year though. In the meantime, I'd save up lump sums via a mix of savings accounts and managed investments till I could cover at least one of the three areas below, and ideally split across 2-3 of them. 

 * housing income investments in several locations. Ie, manchester, edinburgh, london. Big , in demand cities with varying prices. Typically you can get 5-7% returns on fully managed properties, so 500k in housing here will get you up to 35k/year income. Rightmove has a lot of properties listed as investment/retirement incomes at the moment.

 * government bonds (uk, swiss etc). Returns are 4% and 2% but it's very safe money, good for a long term income. 500k will get you 20/10k year 

 * lowest risk corporate bonds. I haven't looked into these that much but you should be able to get better rates than with government bonds , although the risk is higher. I'd be looking for 6-8% on these , so 30-40k a year back from 500k invested. 


the overall goal would be to not need not to work as soon as possible. Not so you can retire ASAP, but so that you have the option to whenever you want to. Having a paid for house and a 30k+ income basically means you can say 'fuck this job, i'm done' and go  travel the world and do whatever you want.

Talks about profit sharing make sense in a world where your employees give two shits about the success of the company, but these days there's no job security and thus no job loyalty.

While the ISPs could never try to keep records of the NAT tables in each customer's router, they can trivially keep data on what public IP addresses they assigned to what customer, when, where, how etc. ISPs likely already do this anyway so that they can respond or pass on abuse claims from other network operators (or those speculative invoice wankers who get court orders for the data)

But every business is different - every single one-size fits all policy (or fits all with more than X employees) as dictated by the two Eds - rather than left to individual firms to decide - acts as a brake on innovation and experimentation.

Another reason is that shareholders receive dividends (i.e. a share of profits) in return for their capital.  Their capital is at risk - they aren't just at risk of missing out on future profits, but they can lose their entire investment.  In smaller firms, large shareholders are often directors and use their own money to loan to the firm in bad years, over and above their equity.

This is a good example of the inefficiency of capitalist structures commonly used by many large firms, which effects higher value workers.

The more 'barriers' there are between a worker and them being able to demonstrate direct, quantified (ie in money) value, the less chance they have of getting more reward.

Attempting to artificially distribute the company profit between people will not work at all, ever.  The only way to make that happen is to have those who are making the decision to do that, get a value from doing that.  This is why many small firms give share options and the like to key workers, these are very useful as they not only incentivise people to work with the whole firm, but also normally have a vesting period which means the worker can not quit without loosing them.

So, assuming the guys in the store follow company procedure, your phone will be wiped of all data.

Realistically there's nothing you can do now. If they were going to do something untoward it would have already been done. Chances are the people in the store are pretty normal people who just sent the phone off as per policy and wiped the data, but there is a chance it could be stolen.

Britain rightly prides itself on the flexibility of its labour market. It appears to hit something of an international sweet spot, broadly protecting employees from exploitation while allowing managers to manage.

Bearing witness to this success, British unemployment is no higher than that in the US, despite a worse recession and recovery. Employment rates in the UK have never been higher for those aged 16-64 and the country is seen as a beacon to the unemployed in less fortunate European economies. Jobless rates above 10 per cent in France, Italy and Spain are a world away from the 5.7 per cent boasted by London.

Not so fast. For all Britain’s ability to look down on its Mediterranean neighbours, evidence is mounting that we have been aping one of their most destructive features: the creation of a dual labour market which discriminates against the young and inexperienced.

In Rome and Madrid, despite recent efforts at reform, stringent employment protection regulations have cosseted older workers on permanent contracts while new hires have minimal rights. In Britain, a similar effect has been achieved even without disastrous rules. Cash-strapped employers have saved money by singling out new employees for worse conditions than time-servers. It is easier for employers to hit out at those who cannot complain because they have not yet started work and existing employees have turned a blind eye. So, for an easier life, employers tell new recruits to lump it because “the world has changed”.

Hidden for many years, the effects are now crystal clear in the data. Youth unemployment at 14.3 per cent is about three-and-a-half times the rate of those aged over 25. While those aged between 16 and 24 account for a third of employment with “zero hours contracts” offering no guarantee of the amount of work on offer every week, the same group only accounts for 12 per cent of jobs with normal employment contracts.

The upshot is that even with higher qualifications than any previous generation, the youth of today have seen their wages fall far behind older colleagues, often with the same employer. In aggregate, Resolution Foundation research shows that the real median wage of those aged 22 to 29 fell 12.7 per cent between 2009 and 2014, compared with a 9 per cent drop for people in their forties and a squeeze of only 3.9 per cent for the median employee over 60.

Private and public sector employers have cut wage bills by eliminating automatic annual increments for inexperienced staff and waiting for their older, more expensive workers to retire on rather good pensions.

The consequence of Britain’s disguised dual labour market copies the overt rules in other countries albeit in a less extreme form. In the short term, hardship is concentrated among younger people who are no longer well off in society. In the medium term, by favouring the long in the tooth, younger people will miss out on experience, training and opportunities to improve their skills, damaging long-term employment and the nation’s wealth.

Remember, the relative gains for older workers come, not because they are worth it, but through the exercise of power, even in a relatively flexible labour market. Forget unions, the genteel grey brigade in Britain’s workplaces is the new militant tendency.

The good news is that there is some hope ahead that the pernicious dynamics hitting the young is beginning to change. Youth unemployment is now falling faster than general joblessness at the same time as a surge in the numbers reaching the retirement zone. Demand for younger workers should go up quickly, raising pay levels towards a more sustainable balance. That is, so long as the youth show a reciprocal lack of solidarity with their elders and demand a better deal.

It is ok to complain if your salary is unreasonable, but Sterling being offered 100 k a week, makes him our best paid player only behind Gerrard (and possibly balotelli?). Not in a million years is that unreasonable for a 20 year old who is not more important than players like coutinho, henderson and sturridge imo.
I think we should not give into pressure on this, it will send a signal to other players that you can just make a long contract saga and eventually you get what you want.

- work for less than 16 hours a week and earn up to £104 a week, for less than 52 weeks (or for any length of time if you’re in the support group)
This is called ‘permitted work’.

You can also do ‘supported permitted work’ and earn up to £104 a week. This must be part of a treatment programme, or supervised by someone from a local council or voluntary organisation whose job it is to arrange work for disabled people.

There’s no limit to the number of hours per week or length of time you can do ‘supported permitted work’ for.

You must tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you start doing permitted work. They’ll send you form PW1 to fill in and send back to them.

&gt; I suspect what is in Theresa May's head is that each device gets it's own public world-facing IP address - as though cars only ever have one driver.

Well, if IPv6 ever gets wide adoption over here (it has in the US with the major ISPs making good efforts to roll it out), this will actually be true - although even then the ISPs won't have a totally accurate record, because the ISPs just hand the customer a network prefix and their router/network devices handle the assignment.

It caught a lot of teams off guard and now on the second go through they have become more aware and we are becoming easier to shut down. 

That combined with a bit of fatigue, which is by no means an excuse, means that we are dropping some points here and there. The biggest change from our early season form and play is the lack of movement, or lack of sharp movement in our attacking third. For me it seems like we are relying on Hazard to beat 3 players for us to get anywhere. 

Fabregas has dropped off, and I think it is because players are starting to expect him to play a killer ball every time, and they aren't moving into good spaces for him to play the ball. I said during the match against Soton that he missed 4 or 5 passes in a row, and I've never seen him do that, but a lot of it comes down to less options being provided off the ball.

Do not undervalue the influence of this phrase over the rest of your post above. Situations are as much to do with your interpretation of them as they are to do with factual nuts and bolts. You are in a really good position with great prospects.

If you're looking for brutal advice - complete your degree, full stop. Quitting never helped anyone and you'll find it hard to get the time/motivation to complete your course in future. This will then just be another thing on your list of things to feel like your are a failure because of.

Every day you wake up and have to make a decision whether you are going to feel sorry for yourself or you are going to make things better. Investigate cognitive behavioural therapy, look after yourself by completing things you've started and if possible, remember that education is NOT for getting a job, it is a brilliant opportunity to engage with something on your own terms and broaden your intellectual horizons.

Simply put, don't let 'down you' sabotage your life. Happiness is not a state of mind but a constant force of constructiveness and good reasoning. Make decisions, take control and remember that whilst life doesn't owe you anything you owe yourself to take as much from life as you can.

10/10 for LVG though, he finally worked out that playing his in form players in a proper formation is what you should do, he set them up brilliantly against us.

And... that's about where my praise for Man United ends. Sure their players didn't play badly by any means but you can only beat what's put in front of you and what we put in front of them was UTTER dogshit.

This has got to be one of the few games this season where we have been more rested than our opponents and we just looked absolutely knackered from the start, second to every ball, no pace, terrible.

They broke twice in exactly the same area they scored the first goal from, the warning signs were there, we just made it far too easy for them.

Utterly overrun in midfield, Mason and Bentaleb couldn't cope and it was exactly the same on the wings. Attacking Full Backs are great going forward but when they can't defend for shit and the wingers aren't helping we look like an absolute joke.

Eriksen, Townsend and Chadli may not have even been on the pitch for the first half hour I don't think I noticed them at all. I know they're all attacking players but surely they should have seen how things were going and dropped back to help out in central midfield and on the flanks.

Kane was also anonymous pretty much but when you barely ever get the ball as a lone striker (and when you do get it none of your team mates are near you) what on earth is he meant to do.

My feelings on this match are the same as the Capital One Cup loss but just amplified. Yes we lost, yes they played well, but I don't think we made them try in the slightest.

Tax incentives are basically government subsiding companies to do specific things.

I've been in recruitment for a while now, and the market has yet to recover from the economic collapse. There's a lot more impetus on a skilled workforce and graduates are hardly considered anymore. I look through about 30-50 CV's a day on average, of which about 3-5 will be any good.

With regards to your current situation, the best advice I can give is to do something you like or something which makes you even a bit happy.
If you're looking for a job in creative &amp;amp; media, put a portfolio together and create an interactive or design-heavy CV which showcases your ability and creativity.
If you're looking for standard 9-5 work, then keep your CV formal and relevant to what you're applying to.
If you don't want any of this, consider what you may be happy doing and if there's an opportunity to do so, volunteer in that sector to get relevant experience.

I'll be honest, while its inspiring that you know that the university course isn't working for you, having a degree on your CV which isn't crucial to your profession (medicine/law/dentistry) merely demonstrates your ability to commit to something and see it through to completion. It makes you look consistent and proves that you've picked up a lot of transferable skills. Quitting makes it look like you run when things get tough and employers don't want to see that.

10/10 for LVG though, he finally worked out that playing his in form players in a proper formation is what you should do, he set them up brilliantly against us.

And... that's about where my praise for Man United ends. Sure their players didn't play badly by any means but you can only beat what's put in front of you and what we put in front of them was UTTER dogshit.

This has got to be one of the few games this season where we have been more rested than our opponents and we just looked absolutely knackered from the start, second to every ball, no pace, terrible.

They broke twice in exactly the same area they scored the first goal from, the warning signs were there, we just made it far too easy for them.

Utterly overrun in midfield, Mason and Bentaleb couldn't cope and it was exactly the same on the wings. Attacking Full Backs are great going forward but when they can't defend for shit and the wingers aren't helping we look like an absolute joke.

Eriksen, Townsend and Chadli may not have even been on the pitch for the first half hour I don't think I noticed them at all. I know they're all attacking players but surely they should have seen how things were going and dropped back to help out in central midfield and on the flanks.

Kane was also anonymous pretty much but when you barely ever get the ball as a lone striker (and when you do get it none of your team mates are near you) what on earth is he meant to do.

My feelings on this match are the same as the Capital One Cup loss but just amplified. Yes we lost, yes they played well, but I don't think we made them try in the slightest.

Again, there is no consensus as to when the foetus becomes a ""baby"" rather than a group of morphing cells. Recent study has proven the foetus isn't aware/lucid or even functional for a large majority of it's early term.

In this video the woman states that at 21 days a foetus' heart starts beating, this is true, but also at 21 days that foetus is smaller than the period in this text.

Another issue is that if the pregnancy is risking the life of the mother. Do think it's more important to protect the parent or force them to have the child in this case?

Personally I believe it's more important to protect the fully developed and 100% for sure living parent. So in that case, ""Murdering a baby"" is the right thing to do.

Do you disagree with all abortions or take exception to life viability or danger to the mother?

&gt;The parent does not have the right to kill their child.

Well, you are correct in the most literal sense that the parent isn't legally allowed to carry out an abortion nor kill a living breathing child. You are wrong in the fact that in many countries they are legally allowed to choose to terminate a pregnancy. The UK has strict conditions to be met before a termination can be carried out. 

The vast majority of cases (outside medical emergencies) have a termination limit of 24 weeks. This date has been chosen both through the scrutiny of scientific research and moral obligation of the medical profession to protect life. It's not taken lightly (just as having an abortion isn't).

Don't mix up the 24 week limits as the standard either, most pregnancies take place much much earlier than that (and this is always made clear to the mother by the medical services), when the foetus is barely recognisable as human, and for all intents and purposes is not in any way a functioning human.

null,false,istara,australia,Australia,null,"Australia effectively bans unskilled migrants. You can get in as a refugee, or via family (it's very hard though and increasingly restricted, sometimes fairly, sometimes absurdly). Generally you have to be highly skilled to migrate here. However permanent migrants and their children are not denied public services such as education and healthcare, even if they are not citizens yet.  Temporary migrants (eg 457 visa) I'm not sure. UK migrants and visitors still get reciprocal emergency healthcare at least.

Regarding free public education, in the UAE as a migrant - temporary, which everyone is - you are nearly always required to pay for your children's education. There are some very rare exceptions where you might get sent to the ""Royal school"" if your father is working for a sheikh or something. But generally it's private education only. You also likely wouldn't want your child to go to a local school due to vastly different educational expectations and standards. (I once had to assess some third year university students, and I would estimate they were roughly at GCSE level).

So those are a couple of examples where similar policies are in place. I'm not saying they should be in place in the UK, but I don't think they should be considered outright absurd *in certain cases*. They are not without precedent. But I don't think children should be punished for having low-skilled or lazy parents - migrant or native.

Fucking Lennon. Jesus, we should just buy him. As long as part of the cost isn't losing McCarthy, he'd be stellar for us.

On to McCarthy: still one of our most important players, still a future captain in my mind.

Lukaku: you fucking beast of a player. You're playing like we all knew you could, and it's awesome.

Alcaraz: fuck's sake, what an epic game from the bloke. I've slagged him off plenty, and lately felt he's a decent back up for Stones, but today he was genuinely excellent.

Baines: great to see him back in the line up.

But above all that? What made me really happy about this game was the amount of fucking goals we went for. It ended 3-0, sure, but the pressure didn't stop. Osman, Kone, Barkley, Lukaku, McCarthy, Lennon, all regularly taking chances when they saw them open. Yeah, I know, a lot of them were saved, but the fact that we're taking chances like that is exactly what I like to see.

All said its a good unit and probably the best bang for your buck your going to get.

Less tight budget, i can highly recommend the Contour Roam 2, water proof out of the box a whole range of setting to suit virtually anything your going to need and its pretty small and compact. Down side here is that there are no way to change any of the settings in camera, you need to do that via a pc. Best part has to be the laser alignment that shows you if you have the camera aimed correctly.
Also this camera does not have a removable battery, although there seems to been almost no problem of battery faults and the ones ive seen Contour were happy to fix them

Budget Go Pro, im not sold on them really, looking at footage taken from them they always look abit drab and poor quality. theres no arguing the better models are excellent cameras so if you could get one used for a decent price and dont mind the shape then that could defiantly be an option

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"The Chornobyl reactor had no containment - there just a thin roof covering the reactor.


The reactor design was known to be unstable at low power (with a tendency either to ""stall"" or experience uncontrolled runaway.)   Because of this, the plant manual said never to operate below 50% power except during start-up and shutdown procedures, and then only as briefly as possible.  However, the operational staff had not been taught why low power operation should be avoided.


A test had been ordered by the head nuclear inspector. The test manual stated that the test should be performed with the reactor at between 50 and 100% power, but the plant manager ordered it carried out at 20%. Because of delays in preparing for the test the reactor ""stalled""  due to excessive operation at low power. 

Furious, the plant manager ordered the reactor restarted. Staff tried frantically to restart the reactor but were confused as to why it would not restart. To get around this apparent block,  operators set the control rods to the full power position. Still nothing. They continued adjusting; they went past the ""never ecxceed"" position, and eventually they went all the way until there was no control left. At this point, the reactor started to come back on. 

Not long after that, it started to experience run away. The emergency shutdown button was pushed and the automated shutdown sequence started. Due to a design oversight in the shutdown sequence, the first 5 seconds of the sequence actually enhanced the nuclear reaction and caused a brief power spike. This was known about by the plant designers, but not considered a problem and operational staff had not been trained about this. 

When the shutdown power spike hit the reactor that was already super unstable, and already experiencing a runaway,  it made the runaway a lot worse. Calculations estimate that the reactor reached 10,000% of normal power before steam pressure got so high, that the reactor's concrete lid was ejected by a massive geyser of steam.

Now, he's both a pretty expensive backup for his use and when he does play, he's out of match form because he gets nothing besides training. 

It's not like our fullback play has been flawless to even say you can't risk rotation. Ivanovic whips in a couple of crosses and scores every now and then, but I just see so much more potential with a Luis-Dave combo than a Dave-Iva combo. Luis on the left offers fantastic linkup play with Hazard in the limited matches we've seen, probably the most lethal FK option and is super smart when it comes to knowing when to go forward. He is obviously very solid defensive and also has the pace to track back when a counter is on. This would also allow Dave to play in his natural RB position and we know that he would obviously be just as effective defensively, but he'd also be a bigger threat offensively because he would be able to actually cross since he can cross from the right effectively. It'd still be a classic one defensive, one attacking fullback combo, but one I think that would help our team in both build up play and reacting to counter attacks. The amount of times when there's a counter by the other team against just Dave, Terry and Cahill/Zouma, because Ivanovic isn't even close to getting back into the picture, has been way too high this season.

If they don't there's always going to be lingering doubt around the circumstances, especially if Tymon doesn't take it to court (I wouldn't, partly because of the media circus that would follow it).

The correct action here would have been to investigate the matter internally and continue with Top Gear, rather than start a media frenzy. It's not like Clarkson's going to be a risk to anyone until the end of the season.

null,false,TomShoe,1972crest,,null,"First of all, yes, football tactics can absolutely become outdated in a year. Coaches don't just experiment for shits and giggles, they do it because the game, especially at the highest levels, is constantly changing. 

Secondly, the issues the team faces right now are bigger than 4-4-2. Pellegrini is an impressive coach and his teams are lovely to watch, but it should be noted that he took over the best defense in the league several years running, and was unable to maintain anything like that level of defensive solidarity. We're also weak in the midfield in a way we didn't used to be. Fernando has been suspect, Yaya is getting old, and has never really been reliable, meanwhile Dinho has been decent, but not as good as last year now he doesn't have the World Cup to play for. I'd also argue that our strike force is as weak as it's been in years right now. 

But all this is to be expected. Whether or not people realise it, this is very much a transitional period for us. We have the oldest squad in the league by a pretty comfortable margin, but we've also got our eyes on a number of top young players, as well as a number of youth prospects who in a year or two's time will be ready to play for the first team — or at least ready to be sold to other clubs in order to finance moves for better players. 

To that end, I'm willing to forgive a lacklustre season. Every team goes through periods like this, it doesn't mean we've stalled or plateaued, or are about to fall from grace. These things are cyclical, and largely can't be avoided. What can be avoided, and what I'm less willing to forgive, are structural problems like we seem to be having with defense, our approach to european competition, and persistent tactical misjudgments. 

It's unclear right now how much of our problems are simply cyclical and how many are structural, but Pellers needs to make sure he's doing everything he can to make this transition a smooth one. The higher ups know this is a transitional period, it's been part of the plan all along, and they'll be willing to forgive poor results. However they'll also be aware of deeper seeded problems, and if they don't trust Pellegrini to move things forward, he might get the sack. I don't think that'll be the case though. He's an intelligent coach, and he'll get his shit together.

And if we beat Barca at the Nou camp, even if we don't make it through, he will be a genius again, now and forever.

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"I understand Drogba might be a bit better at hold up play, but Remy's hold up play is just fine. Drogba also offers little else so it makes no sense to bring him on when we basically use him for getting the long ball down and nothing else. Remy also is much more of a threat because he can make threatening runs which defenders have to respect and that creates so much more space even if he doesn't get the ball. You're also ignoring that many times Drogba has been brought on in those ""Remy coming on"" situations and in games where we're in control.

Luis has played, but very little for a player of his caliber and talent. He also has only ever been paired with Ivanovic, which I think is the bigger problem. I feel like people are ignoring how poor he's been defensively this season by not marking on corners and not being able to even bother players while a counter happens since he has no pace to get back in the picture. When the same thing happens on Dave's side, Dave is able to come back and contest to help stop the counter, often by himself with a tackle. Ivanovic has been good going forward, but Luis was world class going forward with Atletico. I just think the Dave at RB and Luis at LB has so much more potential than our current option. We'd still have that Mourinho one attacking and one defensive fullback, but Luis would be better than Ivanovic going forward (and coming back) and Dave would be even stronger in his natural RB position with the added bonus of being effective attacking since he can whip in crosses as long as it's form the right side. Plus, we get probably the best FK threat on our current squad outside of Oscar with Luis' free kicks.

I think he's also playing a dangerous game with Scottish voters. Labour has been obliterated up here already for their actions in the run-up to the referendum. Now, his latest statement implies that the political views of 45% of Scotland (actually nearer 50% because of Westminster's reaction post-referendum) have no place in UK politics. In doing so, he pushes those voters even further from Labour and Westminster governance. 

Post referendum, the SNP accepted the result and like Cameron's EU stance, accepted that it would be sufficient to act in Scotland's interests by influencing change from within the union. There should be no issue with a party, voted into government by a country, looking after their voters' interests. In fact, by excluding the possibility of an SNP coalition, Miliband and Cameron are effectively doing the same (in their opinion) for English voters. 

It's a dangerous game, and I don't think they will win. They cannot now credibly accept a SNP coalition later on, so with or without the SNP,  this will be Labour's downfall.

What changed? Well for one the law was hardly ever implemented - no one I know ever got stopped/breathalysed.  People did crash every now and then but it was sort of accepted!  I think the main thing was that attitudes changed so that it slowly became unacceptable to drink and drive.  There was lots of adverts/public informational films and it slowly changed.

Essentially right now the labour leadership thinking is that there will be a last minute labour swing-back. Ruling out a confidence and supply agreement with the SNP now, when there is no reason to may actually entrench the SNP vote. The Scots can be proud to a fault, and we saw this sort of behavior during the independence referendum, where any perceived assault on Scotland or Scottish culture was met with (and exploited by) the SNP for voter gain.

If it becomes clear closer to the election (say in the final 2-3 weeks) that there isn't going to be a last minute swing to labour, then they can go ahead at that stage and rule out any sort of agreement with the SNP - including confidence and supply. In essence, at that stage there will be nothing to lose. I think Labour are fairly realistic that at best the SNP will still be taking 35-40 seats in Scotland. The worst case is they come out with 50+ and labour are wiped out (with a few big names potentially losing their seats even).

However I don't think on any level labour are seriously entertaining a confidence and supply deal with the SNP. The whole thing would be pretty dangerous for them;

* In Scotland every aspect of the Westminster government program that is perceived as good (i.e. rolling back the welfare state, cutting Trident to 3 boats instead of 4, ending the bedroom tax) will all be attributed to the SNP - even though these are all part of the Labour manifesto. It will entrench the SNP as the left of center party of Scotland for potentially decades to come. 

* In England (remember where most of labours voter-base are actually located) the SNP are perceived very negatively almost across the entire political spectrum. A labour government propped up by such a toxic party will do more harm to labour than good and they could see their support slide drastically in England in subsequent elections as a result. 

* The end result will be a flimsy government propped up by an ambitious SNP that will be keen to exploit it at the first opportunity for domestic gain. The government will fail and be subject to a no confidence vote it can't survive. A rerun election could be on the table as soon as 6-12 months into the term.",null,0,null,1426517073,null,0,false,0,cpgkw7x,null,t3_2z89xn,null,t1_cpgkw7x,null,t1_cpgjvvo,null,null,null,1427790656,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

One of the first two would be my guess. I've experienced all three and none are pleasant. If it was the PSI you would be feeling more of a general handling problem. Plus 1 or 2 PSI is not going to cause anywhere near that severe an issue (heat and rider weight alone will change it by that). This is not to say that you shouldn't be checking your tyre pressures!
If the tyre has gone out of shape the pressure will be fine, but running your hand around the tyre you will feel it undulating.

All this aside once your confidence has gone in the tyre you just won't trust it and likely won't get it back till you get a new set of rubber on there. The MOT also isn't a real mechanical check over, as long as it passes emissions the engine could be shot to hell and it would still pass.

We do not play with a ball playing destroyer, a player in the mould of Matic or Wanyama, that shields the defence effectively. I´m sure both our CMs have instructions to try to do this but they aren´t effective enough at that particular role.

We also have lapses of concentration, pretty much across the defence. Walker and Rose have a tendency to mentally check out for a few seconds each game (I realize that some of these perceived lapses are just insufficient cover from their flankbuddy).

I think we could effectively cut the goals scored against us by a third, just introducing a player into the lineup that is comparable to Matic, Wanyama and Senna (for nostalgia).",null,0,null,1426517826,null,0,false,0,cpgla28,null,t3_2z8hwq,null,t1_cpgla28,null,t3_2z8hwq,null,null,null,1427790835,null,20,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,20,null

As for the 2nd point, come on, you can't seriously think that Schurrle waited until deadline day to tell Jose that he wanted to leave? This had been in the works for a little while, you must've seen how the rumors kept cropping up, and then around the 20th is when the Cuadrado rumors started to accelerate, which made sense given Schurrle's situation.

And yes, we were desperate to get someone. Do you think Jose would have felt comfortable if Schurrle had left without getting a replacement? 

All I'm trying to say was I agree the criticism of his performances can be criticized but they are to be expected given how he is adapting to a new country and league and has hardly played any minutes, and we shouldn't expect so much out of him, especially seeing as he wouldn't even have been here if not for Schurrle wanting to leave. Should we expect him to be able to keep control of the ball instead of giving it away 3-4 times, and be able to beat the 1st man off a corner, yeah, but I don't think we should have set our expectations that he should be in magnificent form a little over a month after he got here either.

What a lot of Scots seem to be sidelining is that in May 2015 the Prime Minister of the UK is going to be one of two men; David Cameron or Ed Miliband. No amount of support for the SNP, for UKIP, for the Lib Dems etc. is going to change that at this stage.

Effectively this is Ed Miliband and to a lesser extent David Cameron pointing out that you can vote for whoever you like north of the border. But if you want them to have any power in Westminster then they'd better be either Labour or Conservative - because those are the parties that can stand a chance of winning... the question is whether they do it with a majority, or far more likely a minority.

Personally I disagree with. Well managed this could be a big setback to the SNP provided labour can play out the slow game.

1: Too much space in between the fullbacks and the centerbacks. This was exploited yesterday in the first goal, but was an issue all day. Our fullbacks are sometimes far too adventurous in getting forward in attack or closing down open players on the wing. Due to this they are leaving our defense exposed. 

2: No real cover from midfield. When the midfield presses they leave large gaps behind them in front of the defense. I like the press, but one of it's faults is that it can leave players exposed. 

3: In addition, both of our central midfielders are not really defensive. Bentaleb may hold back more, but he isn't a shielding DM like Capoue or other players, while Mason just tries to close down as quickly as possible. 

4: (This is absolutely conjecture) Verts is too comfortable in the team. Much like Danny Rose last year, Verts has no real direct competition. Due to this, I THINK, he has lost focus and drive. There have been a few goals recently that are due to him missing tackles or not being physical enough. 

5: (This is what I think is the most important) Our team is young. It will make mistakes and lack focus at times. This is just what happens sometimes when you go with youth. 

6: (This is yesterday specific) We should have played Fazio to match up with Fellaini in the air. They had the height advantage on every set piece and constantly played those floated balls to the back post.

It isn't 2010, and both voters and politicians are no longer naive to a modern coalition arrangement. The effect it has had on the lib dems has been devastating. It's quite possible even that Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander are going to lose their seats at the next election. 

&gt; Instead Ed is now giving up the chance to form a coalition with SNP in the hope that enough people will switch back to Labour to form a majority. Big gamble.

That is where you're wrong for a few reasons. An SNP coalition might be good from your perspective in Scotland in the sense it gets Ed Miliband a foot through the door of number 10... but at what cost? For a flimsy government that will fall apart at the first hurdle when SNP support for its bills evaporates in an effort to gain concessions. It will destroy labours future chances both in Scotland and England. A coalition (or supply and demand arrangement) with the SNP is probably one of the worst moves a labour government could make. 

The second point is what a lot of voters in Scotland are missing... **you don't need a majority to form a government**. If neither Labour nor the Tories can gain enough votes to form a government, and neither are prepared to enter a coalition or supply and demand arrangement then the Queen will **STILL** invite one of them (usually the incumbent Tory:LD coalition first) to form a government.

If ultimately that fails then another election will be held. You might think that would be terrible... but it might actually be very good for labour and the Tories, since essentially at the second 2015 general election voters would be going to the polls knowing that the only way they can change policy is by voting either labour or conservative. Essentially they have a choice between two parties... and right now that is what a lot of voters (especially younger ones unfamiliar with minority governments) do not realise. You can vote for whoever the fuck you want... but ultimately one of two men is going to lead us: David Cameron or Ed Miliband. This is effectively what happened in [1974](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974), when Harold Wilson formed a minority government in a hung parliament, whilst a second general election was held. Harold Wilson won for Labour but by only 3 seats... which then collapsed in 1979 when Margret Thatcher called a no confidence motion which itself won by just a single vote margin. The outcome was that she then wont the 1979 election. I suspect we'll see a similar hung parliament this time with a minority caretaker government and a second election.

Also very true. However, it can't be denied that the SNP's lead policy is independence. People may vote for them for other reasons, but independence is their number one goal.

And this is different to other parties how? People who support the Greens are likely to agree with most of their policies

&gt;  1.) It's not a silly policy, honest, it's just a long-term aim; 

I do think the ""long term aims"" is a relevant point, especially when the website and leadership has made it clear certain things are not being considered in the short term (like open borders). People sometimes assume everything on the policy website is something they would try to achieve in one term if they got power, this would be impossible, a cut down list of priorities for the next 5 years will be in the manifesto.

&gt; 2.) Well, if you don't like it, just join us and get it changed (meaning ""reversed"").

Anyone who supports the Greens and doesn't agree with one of their policies will be hoping/working to get it changed, they're just pointing out that if there are one or two policies you don't agree with you could help change them since it's a grass-roots democratic movement not one where policies are imposed from the top down.

&gt; But either way, I have sincere doubts about the seriousness of any party that leaves critical questions of its own funding to a sort of lottery. Gives new meaning to the thought of a Green Chancellor of the Exchequer, doesn't it?

His fellow attackers(except for Kane) aren't seen as real threats so opposing teams don't put the focus on them. We can play 100 balls to Chadli or Townsend or Lamela but until they show they have a cutting edge like Kane or Eriksen, they aren't going to warrant the defensive commitment that the other two do. Yes Chadli has come up big a few times for us this year, but outside of 2 of his goals(Newcastle and Arsenal) most of his goals were of other players design(not saying they weren't great goals they just weren't created by him). Lamela demands attention a bit more than the other two because I think most teams recognize his creative threat when left unchecked that Townsend and Chadli don't have. And townsend is just his own case and bright and speedy winger that doesn't have too much of an end product. The problem is that so much focus is put on Kane and Eriksen at this point that when they are marked out of the game, teams don't see Chadli and Townsend and Lamela as truly threatening creators. Once that happens, I would expect to see the pressure on Eriksen and Kane decline but until Townsend, Chadli, and Lamela prove that they are more of a threat I would expect the majority of the defensive commitment to be put in the center of the park keeping Eriksen and Kane off the ball as much as possible.

&gt; Perhaps traditionally female career paths are paid less as a hangover from previous generations?

And that isn't a problem?

&gt; I also don't really think you can talk about the wage gap in terms of overall jobs. Many people take a certain career path because they choose to - yes, there are some problems socially that can alter what people think they can/should do, but I've never known anyone to have felt like they were forced into a role simply because of gender.

Forced into a particular role would be extreme, but it's clear that young people assume that certain roles are right for them in part because of their gender, which shapes their later career path.

One thing I would say is that it is much more dangerous exceeding the speed limit and concentrating all your attention on mobile speed traps, cameras, police cars. This leaves less attention on the road and other road users. 

I'm not saying I am an angel because I have put my foot down/twisted the wrist more than I should sometimes but it is when I know I'm safe and everybody around me is safe. For the majority of my riding i sit in a 30 at around 28mph and know from feeling how fast this is without using the speedo, this means I'm unlikely to ever get flashed or pulled for speeding in a residential area (unless it is a 20 zone).

I also look at it a different way. When I was driving from Liverpool to Plymouth in my car a pal was doing the same. He would drive the distance sat at 90 in the same car (albeit a year older) and I would do 70-75 all the way their. I would then pass him some hours later at the Shell garage on the A38 filling up and I just carried on my way knowing I had plenty of fuel to get to Plymouth. The money I've saved by not flooring it everywhere I go must be racking up to the hundreds now. Fuel consumption drastically reduces for every 10mph you go over 50-60mph.

Some mobile speed vans also don't have cameras on the sides or the front on their vans which means motorcycles ""can"" get away with it, subject to whoever is in the van not radioing PC Plod down the road to nick you.

Also look on motorway driving as ""you'll only get stopped for a knackered car or dangerous driving, not speeding"". You'll get away with mid 80s on a motorway subject to the road conditions.

3D printing can compete with hero units (or independent characters, or whatever nomenclature one wants to use) but when it comes to an army it's got nothing on more traditional casting methods.

&gt;It's certainly just the price point that would be the sticking point.

What I'm saying is that the prices GW are asking for plastic are based more around sunk costs than fixed costs. At least, that's the conclusion I draw looking at the fact that they're moving increasingly towards 100% injection moulding (metal and resin being phased out completely). Developing products and getting the moulds made costs them but the per-unit cost after that is minimal. As a side note this is why I get annoyed when people talk about models as ""a few pennies worth of plastic"" - it's a daft argument. The cost to the end user for any consumer product is rarely ever based on the cost of the raw materials to make it.

&gt;The latest report into Jimmy Savile’s astonishing freedom to roam the wards of Stoke Mandeville hospital will not lead to the end of the National Health Service. Nor will the forthcoming report that apparently finds a “systemic cover-up” of the unnecessary deaths of babies and mothers at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust between 2004 and 2013. The NHS itself will survive these scandals, as it survived the Mid Staffordshire hospitals scandal of 2005-2008. The immortality of large public-sector monopolies is a given.

&gt;Likewise, although the Jimmy Savile affair has caused crises and resignations at the BBC, nobody for a moment believed that the BBC itself would close. But why not exactly? Private firms that get into this much trouble generally do vanish, by takeover or bankruptcy. Castlebeck, the company that ran the Winterbourne View care home where scandalous treatment was exposed in 2011, went into administration two years later. Pollypeck, Enron and Barings no longer exist.

&gt;Of course, neither the BBC nor the NHS deserve to be shut down because one criminal was allowed free rein by one set of managers in years past. There are plenty of good people in the NHS and the BBC who do not deserve punishment for the sins of others (though the same was true of Barings). But private companies know they have no guarantee that they will continue to exist — and it affects the way they behave.

&gt;Perhaps a form of mortality for public bodies would be a good idea. After all, knowing what we do about self-justification in public bodies, the NHS and the BBC might well be on course to last as long as the Church of England.

&gt;Indeed, as this analogy suggests, it is not just that public institutions survive scandals; they continue to be admired. The NHS is generally considered an object of devotion. We are touchingly grateful that it saves lives, even though that is what we pay it to do, through the nose. The terrible cruelty and chaos of the Mid Staffordshire and Jimmy Savile affairs does surprisingly little to tarnish the halo, as the coming election campaign will demonstrate.

&gt;The BBC, despite experiencing “a succession of disasters of its own making” remains “a widely admired and trusted institution”, in the words of John Whittingdale, chairman of the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee. His committee recommends continuing to pay for the BBC through a flat tax on televisions that hits the poor relatively harder, even though that is “becoming harder and harder to justify” in the internet age.

&gt;Amid plenty of dross, the BBC makes some fine programmes — but so it should with £4 billion a year in predictable income. The NHS provides some fine care and cure — but so it should with £100 billion a year in guaranteed income. Aldi, Morrisons and Waitrose reliably provide lots of remarkably affordable and often fine food without any guaranteed income but we don’t treat them with devotion. Quite the reverse: we moan about them.

&gt;Imagine if a large supermarket firm had maltreated, and sometimes killed, its customers in one of its stores the same way as the NHS had done in Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay. That company would have lost its chief executive immediately, been deserted by its customers, found itself hammered on the stock market and then been taken over by its rivals — and rightly so. The best a grocery firm can hope for is to be taken for granted; it is never going to be celebrated at an Olympic opening ceremony.

&gt;Of the 100 firms that made up the FTSE 100 in 1999 when it last peaked at the current level, 22 no longer exist at all: including Allied Domecq, BAA, Corus, Cadbury Schweppes and EMI. The possibility of extinction by takeover or bankruptcy leads businesses to seek perpetual innovation and reform. This generates improving living standards for consumers.

&gt;Imagine if you are chief executive of either a private company or a public institution. In both cases you are faced with the choice of funking change or embarking on an exhausting and dangerous course of pushing people into new ways of doing things at some risk to your own job. In a private company, the possibility of corporate death nudges you towards the latter course. In a public institution, not so much.

&gt;That is one reason the internet, though its embryonic form was invented in the public sector, did not explode upon the world until private firms started using it. That is why post offices failed to invent mobile telephony, the BBC did not invent social media and the NHS does not develop most drugs. That is why private sector productivity has increased markedly in the past 15 years while public sector productivity has not budged an inch. (Parenthetically, I keep asking people how it is conceivably possible not to increase public-sector productivity in the age of the internet, and I have yet to hear a convincing answer.)

&gt;Mortal public institutions do sometimes exist. One of Margaret Thatcher’s best ideas was that of the urban development corporations — local planning monopolies with limited lifetimes charged with transforming city centres. Some were outstanding successes and it was the acute awareness of the roughly 
ten-year deadline that helped them to be so.

&gt;Conversely, there are also immortal private institutions, such as General Motors, or maybe HSBC — firms that are considered too big to fail and therefore know that they will persist whatever happens. These grow to resemble public institutions such as the BBC and the NHS in their gigantism, their lack of innovation and their tendency to block the process of creative destruction by which innovation spreads to the benefit of consumers.

&gt;As public sector bodies proliferate in number, some way of making them mortal is not a bad idea. If you were starting from scratch, and acting in the best interests of the taxpayer, you might award the franchise to run public broadcasting, national healthcare, perhaps even the defence of the realm, the civil service, the legal profession and the established church, to the best bidder every five or ten years, just as is done with rail franchises and the national lottery — or, for that matter, Ten Downing Street. Of course, the BBC and the NHS (and those other institutions) are much too big for that to be conceivable. Too big to fail, in a phrase.",null,0,null,1426520381,null,0,false,0,cpgmnue,null,t3_2z7yd5,null,t1_cpgmnue,null,t3_2z7yd5,null,null,null,1427791551,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Willian and Cuadrado are both preferred on the right wing.  Our play style allows for the CAM and wingers to switch places, but Oscar is not great as a winger.  Douglas Costa's main position is CAM, but may prove to be better on the wing than Oscar.  

Jose likes to have like-for-like substitutions.  Though some of our subs are not necessarily equals, like Matic and Mikel, they at least have the same default position, profile (size and strengths), and objectives.  A prime example of this is how often Drogba has been subbed in for Diego over the younger, fresher Remy.  Oscar, with Fabregas back with Matic, does not have a like-for-like sub.  Douglas Costa would be it.  

Of course, if we buy another winger on the right to be starter or sub for Cuadrado and make Willian Oscar's competition, things would change.  Another possibility would be that we buy another Ramires type CM to play along side of Matic/Mikel to move Fabregas up front to play fight for a starting place with Oscar.

The SNP just needs to do the same and bear this in mind also, the opinion polls are showing that the SNP vote is pretty solid. The vast majority of that demographic have made their mind to vote SNP and don't ultimately mind if Labour don't become the government even if it is their preference. A recent poll asked SNP voters would they prefer a Tory government but with more SNP MPs versus a Labour government with fewer. Guess what option had the majority? The majority of those voting SNP want SNP representation and it is as simple as that. That's democracy.

Now in the relation to the IPP of course in the end events in Ireland overtook the IPP and even though Home Rule was delivered it was by that point irrelevant as Sinn Féin were demanding full independence. Now if the British government had reacted quicker and more sensitively to Irish concerns that might not have happened (although I think even if Home Rule has been delivered earlier Ireland would have still become independent but more in the manner Canada, Australia or even India did) but because they alienated the Irish by constantly putting Home Rule back they ultimately made independence inevitable.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; I think it's a little bit of a kick in the teeth. 

Yup. The flipside is to see it from Englands point of view. In May about 75% of people are going to vote for parties that support the the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent. Why then would be it fair to allow 5% of the population to force the rest to unilaterally disarm? This is just a single example.. but it points out some hard truths; Scots make up a small part of the population, they aren't in a position to dictate terms to the rest. The choices were laid bare before them in their independence referendum and for largely financial reasons they choose to stick with the status quo. So be it, but that doesn't mean they'll be telling Westminster what to do.

&gt; unlike you, I don't think Scots will forgive them for it. 

I think it's essentially irrelevant what Scots do at this stage. The bottom line is the 55 million British people outside of Scotland don't want what the Scots want (i.e. the removal of the nuclear deterrent and more money to an area that already gets higher per-capita spending). Ultimately if Scots want to govern themselves they should have voted yes last year. They didn't and the reasons they didn't were largely financial. So in essence Scots chose to stay in the UK because it was financially beneficial for them to do so (even more so now the value of oil has plummeted and the North Sea looks decreasingly viable in the long term). That's fine, but the flipside is they stick with the political status quo as well as the financial... and that means decisions are made in Westminster based on whats best for the UK, not just the top part of it. 

If Scots add this to their long list of perceived insults and chose to leave the UK at the inevitable next referendum then so be it. The attitude in England has been consistent throughout: they'd prefer Scotland stayed but don't care if they go. What Scots can't have is the best of both worlds; to dictate UK policy and suck in higher per capita UK spending (even more so as oil becomes less valuable).

I for one would sooner see Scotland try and go it alone than see a man like Alex Salmond get his fat little fingers into UK government policy.

&gt; People sometimes assume everything on the policy website is something they would try to achieve in one term if they got power, this would be impossible, a cut down list of priorities for the next 5 years will be in the manifesto.

Long-term is certainly a relevant point. It's what makes most people so uneasy with this party, and I don't think most people entirely conflate the long term with the short term, they just don't like either. Let's put it this way: if you knew long-term Tory plan was to force everyone they considered to be a pleb to kiss George Osborne's arse, would you honestly even want to *consider* what they were offering for the short-term? 

But additionally, part of the difficulty is in distinguishing between the two, long/short, and the Greens seems particularly pegged with this issue -- they've utterly failed to convincingly make these distinctions to non-members, although it doesn't help that these distinctions would be, to an extent, artificial anyway. You can't entirely separate a small step in a certain direction from the longer direction itself. So to say, ""Don't worry , that's not a policy it's just a longer term goal,"" is a bad argument either way.

&gt; Anyone who supports the Greens and doesn't agree with one of their policies will be hoping/working to get it changed, they're just pointing out that if there are one or two policies you don't agree with you could help change them since it's a grass-roots democratic movement not one where policies are imposed from the top down.

In real life, most people don't have the time to get that involved in their political parties, so they are probably willing to sacrifice a bit of grassroots involvement for thoroughly vetted research and policy development 'imposed' on them (to borrow your terminology). People who don't vote Green aren't automatically 'subjects' of their chosen parties -- they've made a choice to be represented by a certain organisation they deem to be competent and suitable for their interests. 

&gt; so I disagree that it's unsuccessful.

I wasn't saying they've been unsuccessful at raising any money, but was expressing scepticism of their approach being scaled up to government/society size. 

**tl;dr:** You've kind of fallen into a logical trap:  You are arguing in favour of the same two points I said a Green party supporter would, with the same recycled arguments, and without a willingness to admit to (or even take account of) quite how sensible some of these counter-arguments are.

I actually disagree with you on this, if you look at the numbers both Labour and the Conservatives are unlikely to benefit strongly from an SNP alliance. Ultimately one of the two of them will form a government, and they don't need the SNP to do it. What they would need the SNP for is a majority, but it will be such a narrow and weak majority that it is essentially self defeating when balanced against the heavy costs it will ensue. 

I can see how the IPP might be ideologically appealing to disaffected Scots who got their fingers burnt in the referendum last year. But I really don't think its a precedent for anything these days. The situation in Ireland was and is very different. 

&gt; That's another important lesson to learn here in relation to Scotland.

I think its only an important lesson if you approach it from the same perspective the UK approach ireland in the 1920s... ""AT ANY COST"" mentality. In reality though that isn't the approach to Scotland. Clearly the UK is prepared to entertain an independent Scotland and so its less ""at any cost"" and more ""at what cost"". There reaches a point where it is politically and economically beneficial for the UK to simply be free of Scotland and its problems. I think the bottom line of that is the Scottish bargaining position is (and always has been throughout the referendum) deceptively weak.

All kinds of law-abiding people would excuse drink driving with things like ""it was very rural, late at night there was no-one to hit"" or ""he was probably only a little bit over the limit and it was the only way to get home"". I even heard my schoolteachers recount such anecdotes.

I don't see this happening very often, at least not in the UK.

In practice in many cases public sector organisations are more efficient. This isn't *always* an argument against privatisation: outsourcing can be an advantage in running a service which has peaks and troughs, even if in absolute terms it's more expensive.

UK privatisations often create a cosy ecosystem of well connected preferred suppliers, which isn't conducive to efficiency. In the case of the NHS you won't be choosing between the a nice clean BUPA hospital and a shiny new Nuffield. You'll still use your local NHS hospital, but the commissioning body will have chosen a service from the lowest bidder, cut to the bone to maximise profits. There will be a contract (written by people in the same industry as the supplier) and an SLA which will be widely ignored.

And when services are cheaper, it's usually achieved by eroding the T&amp;C of the staff, which creates a race to the bottom for the rest of us.

He either backs his manager blindly or gives into rash decisions. IMHO, the only way we're going to move forward, as much as it pains me to say, is when he leaves, which I have a strange feeling will be sooner rather than later.

The only way we could have stayed up was if Tony backed Harry in the transfer window. You might argue that Harry's signed a few duds but he's also made some great signings for us as well. The Zarate thing has really summed up our season - it's a mess.

It's a massive target, and we would rather it was situated somewhere quieter and more discreet. 

As for the 55m v 5m argument, I think it's too broad a brushstroke to assume there would be disagreement in every issue and that the SNP would seek to benefit Scotland at England's detriment. There's no reason why they could not work to benefit England in order to benefit Scotland by proxy. 

Given the issues we are both highlighting, do you not think it's is time for a reform of either the parliament system (ie: federalism) or voting system (Proportional representation), to reflect the fact that the ideology of one dominant nation will always, by reason of population size, overcome the ideology of another?

That is the point of history, you don't say ""that happened in the past so it can't be compared"" if there is a historical parallel. Ireland and Scotland are of course different countries and the time period was different but I was bringing up the IPP purely as a precedent of a strong small bloc that the Liberals were forced to work with because of parliamentary arithmetic. The way the IPP used their position would not be a million miles away from the way the SNP would (although of course some procedure with the HoC has changed). The conclusion of that particular story was just interesting as a parallel but it doesn't mean I think that's the way things will play out ultimately although I think it informs the current situation as well.

I am afraid I disagree with you in turn because as long as that SNP vote holds up and I see little reason why it should collapse (forgoing any events between then and now) then the other parties have to deal with it. The parties *need* a majority for every bill and importantly for confidence and supply. Without that majority they cannot govern, even a minority government needs it. You either achieve this by a coalition to reach a majority or making looser or temporary deals with smaller parties. Now Labour can try and dismiss the SNP but their bills will fail, they will find it impossible to govern and their government will fall. In the subsequent election unless the Tories are capable of forming a majority by themselves or by coalition then the SNP remain a problem. This could go on and on until they realise that some rapprochement with the SNP is necessary, unless of course Labour and Tories want to link up. 

Anyway on your last point there would be some agreement between us. If the Unionists are truly interested in making the Union work there is a way, although it would involve federalism and a whole lot more self-governence for Scotland. However if they aren't interested in making substantial changes and the Scottish electorate is not interested in falling into line then ultimately independence would be the best solution. I don't believe the Unionists are as interested in making the Union work for all sides as they are in narrow party political interest so I believe independence is inevitable.",null,0,null,1426523179,null,0,1426532517,0,cpgo9h2,null,t3_2z89xn,null,t1_cpgo9h2,null,t1_cpgn8zx,null,null,null,1427792352,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

But I think our main problem is our squad is way too small. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we only 18 non-U21 players registered and of the U21s, only Zouma has seen real playing time.

I've been saying all season that we needed 2 more CBs, plus another DM, but I think we probably need 2 of both.

Our midfield falls apart when we are missing Fabergas or Matic, and we have no one in our squad to replace either of them (Ramires is a completely different player than both of them and Mikel doesn't offer anywhere near what Matic does).

We need a squad of 22 players that Mourinho trusts. Players who can be swapped and it doesn't feel like a major downgrade.

null,false,Hiddencamper,null,null,null,"Nuclear engineer here to add some detail. 

All boiling type reactors have core thermal hydraulic instabilities when operated with a combination of high power and low cooling flow conditions. High power usually means more than 15-20%, and low flow is less than 50% of rated flow. 

Most boiling reactors will experience power oscillations which can, at worst, cause fuel rods to crack or rupture. No explosion, just broken rods. For this reason, BWR plants have an oscillation detection system called OPRM, or Oscillation Power Range Monitor. It will automatically scram the reactor if oscillations are starting to occur. Additionally BWRs have a restricted zone in their power/flow map where operators are required to immediate scram the reactor, and a requirement to immediate sceam if both reactor coolant pumps trip off. This ensures the reactor is not operated in this unstable region. 

Chernobyl's reactor design has a positive reactivity response in this region. This means that it doesn't oscillate, the core runs away. If it is a slow runaway, then normal safety systems can handle it. So the reactor has a safety limit that requires a minimum amount (~30) control rods partially inserted to ensure that any runaway that occurs is slow. With these rods removed during the Chernobyl test, they got into the high power low flow region and had instabilities which drove the core into a runaway far faster than the disabled safety systems or human operator action could protect them from. This is why safety limits should never be violated.

we play two very high pressing full backs who are more auxiliary midfielders than traditional left or right backs.

This means our central defenders have to be sharp and quick to react; I think this is why Vertonghen and Dier are, in theory, the two to have at the back - Fazio is much more experienced than Dier and probably a better 'player' but doesn't have the pace to play the system. Kaboul shares a lot of the same qualities as Dier but isn't counted for obvious reasons. 

So, we have two relatively exposed centre backs. Dier is still very young and inexperienced. 

The biggest issue, in my opinion, is Vertonghen. In theory, he's the player who got in the PL team of the year but his form and attitude is a million miles off that. I can only hope he's still got the reputation to get as high a fee as possible for him so we can bring in two centre halves this summer; one, a Naybet-esque player who can act as the experienced head, and one, the player Vertonghen should be.

I'd argue it goes further back than that. It begins with the slapdash signings made in August 2011 after the late purchase of the club prior to the 2011/12 campaign, signings which included SWP, Traoré, Barton and Luke Young. You might even argue that Warnock's treatment of Taarabt in the Championship glory season was making a pact with the devil, as accommodating his behaviour that year produced some breathtaking football, but nurtured an attitude that doesn't seem to have improved to this day. It also looks like it infects players around him.

&gt;I've always been a big fan of Tony Fernandes, but it's starting to dawn on me that he is the problem with QPR.

The thing is, as terrible a job as he seems to be doing (and I don't like admitting that), he is probably the one thing that won't change. You can shift managers, players, coaches, etc, but I don't think there will be any change of chairman. It amuses me when I see people call for Bhatia to come back as chairman - a international playboy whose life seems to revolve around posting pictures of his gallivanting around with famous names on social media. His current chairmanship of a construction materials company suits him far better.

 &gt;The only way we could have stayed up was if Tony backed Harry in the transfer window.

Maybe so, but Harry would've had to meet him halfway with reasonable targets. Adebayor's tens of thousands a week would've been farcical.

Then in the 80's advertising campaigns started to demonise drink drivers in a way they hadn't been before. Within a short time it became socially unacceptable.

What this shows is the capability of government to completely change the view of the public on an issue. Obviously with drink driving they were using this force for good (by the social standards of today of course!), but it does make you wonder what else the government may decide to slowly change public opinion on.

Thank you.

&gt; Most people don't support Green party policy. Only a handful of surveys allow that conclusion to be drawn, but that still doesn't make it a sound conclusion to be drawn. If you ask people stuff like, ""Do you support human rights, or civil liberties? Do you support people paying a fair amount of tax?"" no one will disagree.

I'm saying most people won't disagree. But they they will go and vote for parties who want to erode civil liberties and take big cheques from tax avoiders.

&gt; What people support are the kinds of things we might call 'principles.' You think anyone out there doesn't agree with most of what you listed?

A few, yes. Mostly those running the other parties.

&gt; People have an issue with the Greens as the party to elect in order to realise the kinds of objectives everyone has, justice, fairness, clamping down on tax avoidance and so on.

I know. I've never said otherwise.

&gt; The other argument lurking underneath all this will probably sound heinous to you but is worth considering. Just because people want something doesn't mean you can (or even should) give it to them as requested.

I know. Mainly due to socioeconomic reasons.

null,false,Evsie,null,null,null,"The principle that banks ""create"" money through debt is simply false. They do not. They cannot. That is the function of the central bank - it is the very definition of monetary policy. Money circulates through the economy (or parts of it) - [this diagram](http://www.bized.co.uk/sites/bized/files/images/circfl_c.gif) is a reasonable (if simple) model. It doesn't show the amount of money in the economy, but essentially when one of those arrows is held up for some reason (e.g. a recession causing households to spend less on consumption) increasing the overall supply can boost things a little. This is a massive over-simplification, but I don't know if you've ever studied any economics so I'm keeping it broad-strokes.

So, full reserve banking: Currently banks take your savings, lend them out to someone else, make money, give you a slice of it as interest and pocket the rest. What full reserve says is that they can't do that any more, they have to have all your money available to you at any time. Yours and everone elses, so there's no money for them to lend out to make money from (we're sticking to retail banking here, investment is a whole other thing). So current capital requirement is complex [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement) and enhanced by BoE rules on banks which carry systemic risk [probably not worth reading if you're unfamiliar with finance at all](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=51e73b3a-6511-4231-b8c5-64be7d4de4f1) - essentially you're asking to go from ~10% tier 1 to 100% (and eliminating any risk weighting). 

Where does that money come from? Over what time period are the banks supposed to find these hundreds of billions? I'm assuming they'll have to retain all profits until the goal is met, but that could still take decades.

Even when it's done they can then only lend from reserves, are they required to be 100% too? How do you record the asset of a loan on the balance sheet? At the moment it's essentially value * risk. A £1000 loan to someone who is 99.98% likely to pay it back is worth £999? Or £1000? Or £1010 with interest? These things matter, and the rules which govern them are national, and international and complicated. 

So, now your savings can't be lent out, you receive no interest on your savings and unless inflation has stopped being a thing, your money is now losing value as it sits there. As your bank can't make money from your savings any more, you are almost certainly paying a fee. 

Finally let me encourage you to read [this article](http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/other-side-of-debt.html) by Frances Coppola, a well respected economist, analyst and former banker (and a very nice lady who helped me out a lot when I first started studying this stuff). 

Soooooo, onto Green economic policies... 

Honestly, there is a *lot* wrong with a *lot* of the core principles, but I only have so much time today. Using [this page](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html) and skipping a lot of it. 

Up top there is a lot of generalisations and principles, which are lovely, but I need to know what that looks like in reality. ""reducing the physical burden they place on the planet"" is a nice line. What does that look like? We all have to stop driving? No more electricity from coal? No more plastics? **HOW** do we relieve that burden, just saying we should is not enough. I'd REALLY like to know how you make EC202 happen, it ignores human nature let alone modern society. 

The ""Indicators"" section is interesting. The first paragraph is simply incorrect, those economic indicators serve valuable functions. Bhutan famously uses Gross National Happiness as a key metric... but they also use all of the others, one does not discount the other. Perhaps we should focus more on GNH, but Happiness is diminished when the wider economy is in the toilet. By all means adopt EC311 *along side* those measures in EC310, but to dismiss them completely is naive at best. 

The objectives in EC401 are, at best, hopeful. Again human nature cannot be ignored and while providing for the basic needs of many will go a long way for some, there will always be others who have that drive to get ahead, and there will always be fields in which they can do so. 

I'll skip the rest of the 400s, CI is covered later (ish). I would like to see a number soon. This is economic policy, right? ""a reasonable rate"" means nothing at all. Centrally directed R&amp;D aimed at an economy which doesn't exist is just amusing to me (in fact most of 407 doesn't make a lot of sense). 

The 500s are all localism, which is something I don't fully understand. Energy policy *needs* to be national. So does defence. So does infrastructure. So does Health. So does (most) tax policy. I don't see decentralisation and localism as the answer to the problems we face. Yes, we're London-centric, that's not going to change any time soon, it's one city with 25% of the population, 22% of the GDP (at least, figures vary). These people, and these businesses are not going to pack up and move to Hull. 

600s... now we're getting into my area! Show me the data, baby! 

Wait, what? 

There are no numbers. 

On a policy page about the national economy, there are no numbers. There is no costing of anything. There is no predictions about the effect of anything. There are paragraphs upon paragraphs of idealism, but not a number in sight. 

You can't just *ignore* numbers. This is economics, not sociology (and my apologies to sociologists). You can't just use phrases like ""appropriate national public expenditure"" because the very next question anyone like me, or any journalist, or anyone who isn't already ideologically ""Green"" for other reasons will ask is: ""what does that mean?"". I'd love a party on the left to talk about national infrastructure spending, and make the Keynsian argument.. but that requires a ""this will cost £x, with a return on investment expected to be £y, and a long term benefit of [outcome]Z."" 

&gt; EC650 The unaccountable exercise of economic power by large corporations has done much to destroy the environment and convivial social structures. Green policies will establish greater community and environmental accountability.


What does that look like, then? Let's say I have a couple of hundred shares in Tesco I bought years ago. The dividend payments normally pay for a holiday, or Christmas, or whatever the hell else I want to spend them on... Tesco are a massive corporation, partly responsible for the death of the high-street, putting butchers out of business since the 80s  etc etc, they're not a Green-y localist company.

Are you going to take them from me? How? Forced sale? If so, at what price? If you're not going to force me to sell how are you going to make this massive company more local? By forcing the pension funds who own most of it to sell? Well, maybe, because later on you essentially destroy that whole sector (with no comment on what happens to people who have pension funds with those companies now) Break it up? How? How are you going to impose your will over corporations to bring about this local Nirvana?

Co-operatives section is surprisingly okay, but if the co-op bank farce has taught us anything, it's that there is a disconnect between co-ops and the wider market, don't push too hard. Still no numbers. 

The entire monetary policy section is just wrong. 

&gt; EC660 In a Green society the informal sector will eventually gain in significance so that formal transactions and money generally will have a lesser role than at present.

My landlord will be thrilled. As will the electricity supplier. Pipe-dream nonsense. It's almost as bad as the Tories longing for the Britain of the 1950s that never really existed. You're building a fantasy world which ignores reality - the result of which is that people who have to live in reality get screwed. 

661 - Wrong. That money is real money, that it's not printed is simply because it is not required to be printed, money doesn't circulate in paper and coin any more. I pay my bills right out of my bank account, likewise my butcher and baker and supermarket. I don't need those notes and coins.

Still, it's nice to see a % sign on the economics page, even if it is being used completely out of context. 

662 - banks still don't create money. 

663 - Banks. Do. Not. Create. Money. 

664 - entirely based on the premise that banks create money. They don't. 

... and now I have to go cook. Might come back to this tonight.

The bit you're wrong about is how they've cranked up their prices. From what I can work out they've mostly kept up with inflation. Some things have gone up more than others. Some things are cheaper now than then.

So do I, back in the 1990s. It wasn't cheap then either. £15 then is equivalent to £25 today, adjusted for inflation.

The battleforce thing is a silly comparison though. Traditional battleforce boxes (the kind you remember) were phased out last year or thereabouts so it's apples and oranges. They were £62.40 (based on that I used to buy them for 20% off at £52) in 2014 before they stopped selling them.

If we go back to the late 1990s comparison of £50 then adjusted for inflation they should have cost £75 - 80. For shits and giggles I looked it up - £50 in 2007 was the equivalent of £62.40 in 2014.

If a church allows one person live in the church building then it is difficult to deny the second person and so on. It would be easy for a church building becomes a homeless shelter rather than a church. 

Unfortunately homeless shelters are very difficult places to run, they have high insurance costs, large cleaning bills and problems with drug use. Most church buildings are not designed for this, they also frequently host children and vulnerable people so any potential for unclean areas (urine, vomit), hidden drug paraphernalia, broken bottles etc. would be hugely problematic.

To prevent this from happening most churches have a blanket ""no one is allowed to live here"" policy. Most churches are also not insured for people to live in the building.

That said most churches do a lot for the homeless. The church I currently attend donates a lot of money, clothes and food to the local homeless charity who are in a far better position to support homeless people than the church itself: They have trained staff, proper support services, drop in centers, food banks and properly equipped shelters. 

The church also partners with that charity to provide volunteers to run the ""soup kitchen"" (our church does sunday nights and other local churches do other nights). This is an area that I personally volunteer in. We distribute food and when available clothes and sleeping bags. we are also able to act as a point of contact and direct patrons to the services and charities best equipped to help them.

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"First off, you should be clear what you mean by ""privatisation"".

You could have what we might call ""soft privatisation"", in which the NHS continues to be funded by taxes and free at the point of care, but the way the taxes are spent are to pay private health companies to provide services, rather than a government agency. Soft privatisation has been the reality for many years now, but its extent is increasing under Tory restructuring.

Then you have ""true privatisation"" in which the government ceases to pay for healthcare via public funds, though it continues to regulate the sector. Healthcare providers are private, and people pay either out of pocket or from an insurance policy. The government may provide their own insurance, and this insurance may well be compulsory for all citizens, unless you opt to enrol in a private insurer (generally paying more for better care).

True privatisation is not really on the cards in the UK, for any major political party. This is how the rhetoric of the left is so effective: they criticise greater soft privatisation, but their language makes people think that true privatisation is what's at hand.

The dangers of privatisation (of both kinds) are generally exaggerated by the bogeyman of the US healthcare system (44 million uninsured prior to Obamacare), but notably many of Europe's healthcare systems are private, ranked higher than the UK's in terms of quality, and still manage to cover the entire population. This is because their insurance sectors are regulated by the government much more strictly than in the US, and through the provision of public health insurance (which the US does not do, unless you fit into medicare or medicaid). Other notable private systems with public insurance which work well are South Korea and Chile.

(See [this](http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2003/02/Int_Health_Comp.pdf) report (PDF) for how the the UK's system is lower-ranked to many others: we have fewer doctors, nurses, beds, MRIs, lower cancer survival rates).

There are two main dangers people warn against with respect to private systems:

1. The danger of people going without health care. This can be easily solved via public insurance systems, it's not a realistic danger unless you're the US.

2. The inefficiencies of profit.

This second problem can be explained with an example. Imagine you have £1000 to spend on healthcare services. In a public system 100% of that £1000 is spent on the provision of the service. In the private system where you have profit-making providers, the portion of the money that is taken as profit does not go towards the provision of services. So if profit is 10%, only £900 is being spent on provision of services.

It follows that in a private system, you'll get less for the same amount of money (whether you're paying private companies via taxation or insurance). As such, you'll have to spend more to get the same level of care, which is the definition of inefficiency.

This worry is somewhat borne out by international figures of [health care spending as a percentage of GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita). US spending is off the chart (17.7%); UK spending is very low (9.4%), even in comparison to other European countries (France and Germany both at 11%). The UK system seems quite efficient as things stand.

However, this argument comes subject to a big caveat: it assumes that the private sector and public sector can provide the same health care outcomes for the same money. If the private sector could achieve the same health care outcome with that £900 as the public sector does with £1000 then the private system is superior, because you're getting the same level of healthcare while also putting £100 in the hands of shareholders (who will go on to invest it or save it). 

Whether or not the private sector can achieve this is the big debate, and it's largely a matter of fact, not principle. In South Korea the private sector is incredibly efficient; intense competition between providers keeps prices and waiting times low. Health spending is at 7.4% of GDP to the UK’s 9.4%, but [cancer survival rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_health_care_outcome) are much higher, as are [number of hospital beds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds) . However, it's by no means certain that the UK could replicate this competitive environment, especially if doctors and nurses formed organised labour (ungenerously, cartels) to keep their wages high.

**What do I think should happen?**

What, you think I'd write a post this huge without injecting some personal opinion?

I think some level of soft privatisation is acceptable and even desirable, given the argument that competition increases efficiency. However, I think there should be safeguards in place in place to make sure efficiency *does* increase: firstly, the government should continue to provide public services, in competition with the private service providers. This way, the private companies will only win public money if they can meet the health outcomes for a lower cost than the public provider. Secondly, I think it should be trialled in limited areas. If it doesn't work, then we'll admit it and revert to the previous system. That's the pragmatic, evidence-based thing to do. It's important not to be slaves to ideology: we do whatever provides the best healthcare outcomes for the least money.

Secondly, when you look at the UK healthcare spending per capita and see how low it is, you realise that we've got room to spend a little bit more to improve care even further. However, tax raises are unpopular. To this end, I think NHS funding should be separated out from the general tax pool, funded by its own separate tax, replacing national insurance. People in general accept the need to fund the NHS and will be less resistant to rises in a special NHS tax than to general taxation increases.

The first paper essentially concluded that charging the fees had little effect on doctor visits, yet also did not have any worthwhile impact on costs. Essentially rendering them unnecessary.


The second paper argues that the first paper fails to take into account separate macro effects which would also affect the control group, especially that of rising drug copayments, The paper overall finds that the copayments *do* significantly reduce the number of doctors visits in Germany. 

So its not necessarily the case that it didn't deter people from going to their GP, obviously depending on how you regard each paper, in fact the German system may even prove my point.

Holyrood is the centre of the SNP universe, not Westminster and not even with 50+ MPs. They won't do anything to risk their standing in Holyrood. Their aim, for now, is to get as much power away from Westminster to *their* centre of power.

There's been a lot of talk about Labour up here being a ""branch office"". SNP in London will definitely be a branch office. It will be whipped and run from Edinburgh.

Fair enough, cunt flap.

&gt; Reading something, by definition, is not that same as something being realistic or sensible.

Well done. I read them and understood them.

&gt; I thought it was clear I was not disputing the economics of basic income, but rather the politics of the matter. That should also make clear to you the reasoning behind why their policy manifesto is 'unrealistic' in the sense that I am using it -- But since you need me to spell it out for you: This party has one MP, most people think they are nuts, and will not have a majority (or indeed any real policy influence) in 2015. Therefore, all of their policies are unrealistic in this sense.

Ah, ok. I agree.

&gt; PS - If you're not dim, why do you have a double standard in that only I have to provide you rationale? Did you read that bit about replying with pithy one-liners?

I don't and I did.

&gt; PPS - Are you aware of how bad an argument it is to say that there is a hard-line difference between long term objectives and short term plans going toward them?

It seems to me that not knowing how fast you're going nor knowing what the limit is on a given stretch of road is irresponsible (in the most slightest way). You probably just need more time in the saddle to become more familiar with what speed you're travelling without having to constantly look at the speedometer. 

If you travel the same routes regularly make sure you know the limits in advance and stick to them (or there-abouts, there is some leeway as you mentioned. Remember that the speedo isn't 100% accurate either, especially if you have different sprockets or wheels) and if you're on unfamiliar roads then looking for signs should be a part of your observations. Failing that then use the rule of thumb about pavements and street-lights etc. Single and dual carriageways have set limits, as do motorways and variations should be clearly posted. Keep up with the flow (or behind someone and out of sight of speedtraps!)


Also, a big part of not getting caught speeding is knowing the usual/obvious sites for the traps, these become clear the more you ride/drive as you'll start to see the police in the same spots. There is also **a lot** of luck required to never get a ticket (if you do speed on purpose). With unmarked cars and bikes out on the popular biking roads you can never be really sure whether it's safe or not.

Well tea is a shortened form of ""tea time"" which was a serving of tea in the late afternoon and was commonly served with biscuits (cookies), cakes, pastries or light savories.  There is also High Tea which is similar except for being served later (early evening).  Tea time/high tea basically get shortened to ""tea"" and has become a alternative name for a light evening meal.

Dinner typically refers to the main meal of the day and can either mean lunch or the evening meal depending on local custom.  Supper is an alternative name that exclusively refers to an evening meal.

A country needs a set of laws to function, otherwise everything would be completely chaotic. I saw a Jim Jefferies thing the other day about how ""a small minority ruin it for the rest of us"", or words to that effect. This applies to speeding; some dicks are careless, they go crazy and they hurt themselves, or worse, others. And it's true, the faster you're going, the less time you have to react, and if you do get in a smash, you're going to do a lot more damage. This is why we have speed limits.

But attitude and common sense surely play a role. If you're doing 80 on a clear motorway, not weaving around or pulling wheelies, who in their right mind would do you for speeding? Since the whole point of speed limits is about danger (probably), and how are you endangering anybody in this instance? You aren't really. You could argue that, on a clear motorway, you could be doing 200mph and it would technically be ""alright"", but that's a different kettle of fish. Everybody will draw the line somewhere different, and that's part of what makes society so complicated.

So I see speeding laws (and others) like this: they're there for if you're being dangerous (or otherwise antisocial), so they can point and say ""look, see, it says right here. No more than 70. Now we can do you"". But if you're being reasonable (and different people's definition of ""reasonable"" is why this is a grey area), then what's the point of doing you? It's just work for them, an inconvenience for a (theoretically) productive member of society who's trying not to inconvenience anybody on their way to, say, a meeting they're a little late for. Totally understandable, to me.

This is the kind of mindset and justification I have, anyway, for (again, here's the problem word) ""reasonably"" speeding on the motorway. I generally sit at between 80 and 90, and have yet to run into trouble. But that's totally anecdotal, and I'm not part of any minority group so I can perhaps get away with more things than some. So at the end of the day, I think it boils down to what think is reasonable, and how quickly you can accept responsibility for any potential consequences. If you're doing 70 in a 40, and you kill some kid as you go around the corner, can you accept responsibility for your actions? How about if you get into a bit of trouble for doing 80 on the motorway? Can you accept responsibility for that?

Now, I get that speeding, as a general rule, is not a good thing. Take it to the track if you want to be the next Rossi. But people are only human. I challenge you to find a single person who abides by every single law in the book in all areas of life. You even see coppers above 70 without the blues and twos on, and nobody really bats an eye.

Dropping down into the Championship, you could try Fulham v Brentford on Good Friday, but given it's a local derby the demand for tickets is going to be higher than normal, so you may still have trouble. **Millwall v Charlton is best avoided** - it's another local derby, to say Millwall fans don't have a good reputation is a massive understatement, and they're in the relegation zone and have just sacked their manager, so the risk of trouble is higher than normal.

If you don't mind less polished football, but a cheaper more traditional English football experience, then AFC Wimbledon v Northampton on Good Friday may be worth a try. They're both mid-table in League 2 (ie the 4th tier), so you're not going to be getting top quality internationals on show, but Wimbledon are a real community club, so the atmosphere's a lot different from going to Chelsea or Arsenal.

&gt;Todo vale para ganar, as they say. Win by any means. “No, actually,” Pellegrini says. Accusations and conspiracy theories create “distrust” and there’s a commitment to a footballing ideal. “Respect the game, the fans. You can’t score a goal, shut down, everyone back, kicking the ball away, and win 1-0 ...”


&gt;The Spanish coach Juanma Lillo once said that we value what ends well, not what is done well, symptomatic of a sick society. “Exactly,” Pellegrini nods. In any case, he adds: “You can win it once that way, getting lucky, but repeated success requires foundations, a style. Winning trophies here is importantísmo, an obligation. You can’t finish fifth and just say: ‘We’ve got a [long term] project.’ But we have won

A cheeky little jab at Mourinho, and an insight into why he comes off as stubborn, he wants to win n the right way, not just win. I think that's a great thing to have long term, it's the kind of attitude that leads to managers bringing through youth, playing exciting football and also shows why we're not going to sign a manager like Simeone. 

Also this bit :

&gt;“I prefer not to offer reasons, because they sound like excuses and there’s no excuse,” Pellegrini says. 

Seems to explain why his post match interviews are always so frustrating and he never really offers much. 

Also I have no idea what a _crack_ is, but I agree we need a marquee signing under 25 and I'm pretty sure one is coming the way we've scheduled the £32m to arrive in summer. By the way, if you include that £32m we only have a net spend this season of £15m - less than Leicester.

I would guess that this might be what led the Tribunal to think she hadn't acted in good faith. Bear in mind that the money the trust spent defending itself [by which I mean its senior executives] probably bought better representation than Dare had.

If you're bullied out of your job, but it's not in respect of whistle blowing, you can't rely on the whistle blowing legislation to protect you. If it's not in respect of a protected quality (age, race, gender, etc.) the Equalities Act doesn't protect you. 

It's a shitty state of affairs, but the way the legislation works is that it prohibits specific acts. This means that what is not prohibited is, in effect, allowed. It **is** damning, but that doesn't necessarily amount to being illegal.

Hopefully the trust will back off on an appeal rather than have more of its dirty laundry aired in public. Even if it does though... If Dare receives recompense it will come from the public purse, not from the pockets of the responsible people.

The idea is that they control things that are only important to them (like say education in Scotland) and largely irrelevant to the 'bigger picture'. The reality though is all it seems to do is introduce additional layers of bureaucracy and political infighting, and snowball into further devolved power. It creates a perverse situation where people like Alex Salmond can take credit for the good work that comes out of Westminster (like higher per capita spending), whilst painting Westminster as the enemy for the bad things they have to do (like raising it through disliked taxes).
 
I can absolutely see why ideas like this are appealing to people say up in Glasgow. They aren't appealing to those of us down in the South East. All further devolution seems to be doing is snowballing into further devolution, with more and more money flowing out of middle class England into the regions - in an effort to placate them politically. 

There is now this demonic idea of London up in Scotland, where rich people cavort with all the money and scoff champagne at Scotlands expense. The reality is the South of England is full of hard working people trying to do their best against rising prices and diminishing wages. There is now very little scope in the South to indulge in more parliamentary reform especially where more funding (or control of it) is disseminated to the regions. Sometimes central government has to make hard choices, and those choices involve things like sending HS2 to Leeds and Manchester and not to Scotland. It also means siting our nuclear facilities on the Clyde where they are strategically useful rather than politically acceptable to the Scots. These are hard choices, and just because 5% of voters in the UK are voting as an SNP-Bloc doesn't mean they can command the rest of the nation. It's hard truths time for Scotland post-referendum, and I don't think they've quite realized it yet... especially if the next government is a conservative one. I really don't think a federal system would be to our advantage.

The cost of parking gets added onto any cost 'just want to pop in to pick up x, will take 10 minutes' and cost £3 becomes 'will cost £5.50' and is no longer worth it. And yes, they will charge you that even if you only stop for 10 minutes to pick something up from the shop closest to the door.

They also charge me between £2.50 and £5 to give blood, so I hate them for that. 

I would go shopping if the shops within the shopping centre could validate your parking if you spent over say £10, and they allowed the blood centre next door to validate parking too.

If the woman in the article were an irreplaceable part of the company then they would have negotiated to keep her. I find this topic such a tricky one to talk about because on the one hand I feel like it makes sense in a company to replace people who may cause ""problems""/""difficulties"", but on the other hand that literally makes the company a soulless, greed-machine. 

My main problem with the whole gender wage-gap thing that seems to be trending for a while now, is that it literally is just arguing that the median of all women earn less than the median of all men without even talking about the deeper issues in society. It feels like an excuse for people to get angry without even understanding what it is they're getting angry about. It's like all the problems with drugs and people being jailed for possession/using, rather than trying to figure out why the people felt the need to use drugs in the first place. 

I wish I could think up an easy solution that would eventually help fix these problems but since they're social problems it will take a loooong time for society overall to encourage young people to go into whatever career they wish, regardless of gender (and by then a whole bunch of other problems will have cropped up).

I think it could be said that comments here might influence the case, but I don't think anyone could argue that they'd be posted with the intention of influencing it.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; It is NOT effortless. You should be checking your mirrors, watching the pavement for pedestrians, observing the road for hazards and so on.

Checking my right and rear mirror, for me, is effortless as they are in my peripheral vision and constantly scanned, so long as I'm not wearing my small glasses (my aviators work well).  Only the left requires attention.

&gt;The fact that people zone out is a sign of their piss poor driving. The fact they zone out so much they need a phone to keep them distracted is appalling.

Not sure why you conflate these two.  There is actually some interesting research been done in people zoning out.  Airline pilots, flying these great a380s and the like get super, super bored during their shifts.  They are not doing anything, because the planes are so automated, yet the meat bag is required should something happen outside of the autopilots handling (say AF447, ok pilot error to begin with, but still a good example).  Now the latter part, I'm not sure where you get the idea that a phone is needed to keep them distracted is coming from.  I'm not saying that at all (however for the 'backup human pilots' this is something been researched) for driving I don't think that is the case.  As I said, I think that people get complacent, they do things they shouldn't.

&gt; The idea you can safely use Cortana or some other hands free bullshit has been proven wrong time after time.

Not really, because it is little different to having a conversation with the person in the passenger seat.  I don't say this lightly, I've studied human factors and performance, you have to if you wish to hold a pilots license.  I am aware of the impact under many circumstances, but on the context of driving down a dual carriageway, with excellent visibility, it is of no significant hindrance, any more than listening to the radio is.  Obviously a busy high street, merging from the m40 to the m25 is different case.  I can safely say, and I am certified by both EASA and FAA that I can happily do complex tasks, whilst talking on the radio, in a manner more complex than using Cortana, if you disagree, I'd suggest taking it up with them.

Now anything, anything at all is a distraction, driving whilst stressed, after having an argument with your partner, it's all going to impact negatively.  That nsc report I disliked because the spin on the write up suggested that there was little benefit in having a true hands free system.  The fact is driving should be considered a hard task, it isn't, this is the problem, because so much of the time it requires no attention.",null,0,null,1426535604,null,0,false,0,cpgvzyx,null,t3_2z7y8b,null,t1_cpgvzyx,null,t1_cpgv2e3,null,null,null,1427796032,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

2' - Fabianski gives the ball right to Sturridge, he wins a corner, which leads to nothing.

4' - Swansea are passing it well, until a ball is hit too long, and Liverpool have a goal kick.

6' - Henderson is in the book for a tackle on the edge of the box.  Sigurdsson's on the ball, it's a decent cross into the box, which Mignolet punches out.

9' - Swansea with a decent passage of play, a good run with some threaded passes, which leads to an offside call.  Liverpool have the ball now.

11' - Liverpool trying to build something here - the final passes not linking up yet.

It isn't ""spin"" from NSC. There's tonnes of research proving the dangers of voice controlled texting. 

Using established research protocols borrowed from aviation psychology and a variety of performance metrics, drivers engaged in common tasks, from listening to an audio book or talking on the phone to listening and responding to voice-activated emails while behind the wheel. Researchers used the results to rate the levels of mental distraction drivers experienced while performing each of the tasks. Similar to the Saffir-Simpson scale used for hurricanes, the levels of mental distraction are represented on a scale:

Tasks such as listening to the radio ranked as a category “1” level of distraction or a minimal risk.

Talking on a cell-phone, both handheld and hands-free, resulted in a “2” or a moderate risk.

Listening and responding to in-vehicle, voice-activated email features increased mental workload and distraction levels of the drivers to a “3” rating or one of extensive risk.

As for talking to passengers - again tonnes of research shows talking to a person not present is more distracting. Passengers know when to shut up when the driver is performing a complex task.

null,false,aeisenst,num5,,null,"Agreeing with other people in this thread, I think the problem originates in the midfield and the fullbacks, rather than the CD. We play two very attacking fullbacks, but don't play a dropback midfielder. When we start our attack, immediately we only have two guys covering in the back. Maybe this would work if we had two world-class CBs, but we don't have that level of quality. Two centerbacks just won't do the job. We need a third man back.

To fix this, we have a few options. One is start playing Davies over Rose. I know that Rose has been consistently strong in the attack, and was pretty much the only guy who played defense in the last game, but generally he leaves the defense exposed because he runs so far up. Since we don't have a clear defensive right fb, we'd have to replace him.

On the other hand, we could provide that third man in defense from the midfield, but that would mean abandoning Mason (probably), for Capoue, who has been less than stellar this season. That way, when the fullbacks run up field, he can just drop into providing the third man in back.

Finally, we can try to sign a genuine, world-class centerback to pair with Vert. This is easier said than done, though. I do like the idea of pairing him with Alterweireld, just because they have history together. As to whether this will be enough to live without any assistance on the counter, we'll have to see.

EDIT: Another option, though one that will never happen, is we could play five in the back. Start each game with a back line of Vertonghen-Dier-Fazio, with Dier sliding up a bit to help in the attack. This would free the fullbacks to play further up, but in exchange, we'd have to do without wingers. Considering our wingers have been pretty crappy this season, though, I wish Poch would give this formation a run.

Oh lord.  So let me clarify, most of the sheds I fly do not have these things.  I've flown some very old vintage stuff too.  We're not 30,000 in an airway under IFR.

So, when travelling at 150mph, 800ft above the ground, having to manage many, many things at once, I'm also listening to all traffic, plotting in my mind their position, location, and where they are.  Now formation is fun, I've never flown that at more than 100mph, but suddenly, you've got 10m of space whilst doing the exact thing.  Three dimensions is harder, much harder, geometrically one might say.  Then you've got wind too.

So yes, I'm **very** qualified to be talking about splitting tasks, there is a reason why you have to study human performance.

Like Torres and numerous others before him, he'll go play somewhere else and do just fine.

As someone who watches more than my fair share of Italian football, I can tell you, without reservation, that Lamela is anything other than average. He's an absolute magician. Whether he'll show it at Spurs is another question but some of the things he did for Roma were so exciting they were almost incomprehensible.

I honestly don't believe any of the above are 'average' some of them aren't of the quality to place in the top 6 of the PL, arguably making them of the quality to play for one of the top 30 teams in Europe, but average?

But you really need to raise a formal grievance/complaint to get anything done. This is in all likelihood going to mean naming names.  
If you don't do this, you will just be fired for not showing up to work, and there's no case to answer because you never raised a formal complaint about the behaviour. Ergo, ""It Never Happened"" (tm).  
You *might* be able to scare HR into thinking that you will raise a complaint and make trouble for them if they don't give you your time away, but it's a long shot. Be sure to document every occurrence of such behaviour of coworkers and when you've told them (and/or management/HR) that you're not happy with it.  
Did HR ever direct you to their complaints procedure about harassment? Was this covered in your induction, or something like an employee handbook?  
If you intend to follow this up, start talking to a real solicitor.  
One final point- this honky would rather you didn't use that term, and considers it racist. Or cracker. Two wrongs don't make a right and all that. Thankyouverymuch.

I disagree. That's not what has happened up here. Instead, it allows for greater democracy because a greater range of views can be heard, such as the discussion of assisted suicide bills proposed by the late Margo MacDonald. Minority groups aren't always something to be demonised and they can often have very admirable policies which are drowned out by incompetence in another field (looking at the Greens here). PR gives them a platform to at least be heard, even if they do not have the majority to push it through alone. Then, we have a more representative vote on the bill rather than the black v white of Tories v Labour.

&gt; There is now this demonic idea of London ~~up in Scotland~~ in the rest of the UK

I've changed that because I cannot allow you to point to Scotland alone in this. That being said, I won't entirely defend the view. The South East of England is indeed very hard working. However, so is the rest of the UK. We all work hard. That's not an unfair reflection on anyone. The criticism that London gets is multi-faceted. Firstly, it's home to the bankers. That's never going to win over the critics and its one of the main sources of this perceived wealth. So we have that wave of hate, directed at them, aimed in the general direction of London. Perhaps its unfair that London as a city catches those stray bullets but thats what happens. Secondly, you may complain that Scotland gets a fairer deal than most, but arguably, London gets the best deal of all. It is the focus of all international business to the detriment of our other cities (England and Wales included in this) and very little seems to be attempted in moving new business to our other cities (while of course keeping London thriving with its existing business - keep the Stock exchange there by all means!). Yes, that pushes house prices up, etc, but the job opportunities which exist there are far beyond what a better qualified person outside of the region could achieve. Moving to the city doesn't solve the issue as the cycle would continue until everyone is living there, and that makes no sense.
In that sense, it isn't just political placation that is sought, but financial fairness.

We're not being unreasonable and playing the victim. HS2, for example is a totally reasonable and cost-effective decision, in respect of not extending it to Scotland. As I said, business is so far removed from Scotland (to the South East) that the link is financially unjustifiable in terms of reaching us.

&gt; especially if the next government is a conservative one

This is a BIG problem for Scotland. I won't tire you with the history (the mines, the poll tax, etc) but I don't have to tell you that the Conservative will never be voted into the Scottish Government (which is almost a shame because Ruth Davidson is significantly more reasonable than most Tory MP's). Now, we can appreciate that majority rules. So if the Tories win, the Tories win, and we'll accept that. However, we should be afforded the chance to prevent that, and our vote should count as much and only as much as any other voter. Using the approximate numbers we used earlier, I'm going to say we are 1 man in 13. 1 man has no more right to rule the other 12 than any of the other 12. I agree. However, when its tied 6-6 (perhaps between Labour and Tory), the 1 should have the casting vote. This is what the SNP are seeking by way of a coalition: the casting vote to keep the conservatives out. The 1 should not be told he shouldn't be allowed to vote and must give his vote to one of the 6's (Labour or Tory). That isn't democratic. 

Some look at this as SNP wanting control over England, but the reality is that the SNP knows this can't happen, wont happen and doesn't want it to happen. It wants a politically similar partner such as Labour who hold well-placed welfare policies and support reasonable(or no) tuition fees, etc. Unlike UKIP, they have no flagship policies to demand in return for a coalition (though I believe Miliband *offered* home rule)  except what I view to be small logistical discussions such as Trident, which takes us to:

&gt;  It also means siting our nuclear facilities on the Clyde where they are strategically useful

I won't exaggerate nor cover-up how I feel about Trident. I would rather the money was spent on the NHS, but it has its place. Having it so close to me, I don't wake up every day in fear of my life, but in the current climate, with Russia probing our defences, I can't say it feels comfortable either. The reality is that if Faslane goes up, Scotland loses half its population in the fall-out. I wonder if you can explain the strategic value of Faslane as opposed to somewhere else? (how about the coast at the borders? minimal population and closer to the centre of the island, so an equal response time to either side).

We're not saying move it out of Scotland and into England, just to move it away from our biggest city, centre of our population and centre of our infrastructure. Put it somewhere where there it can be better defended and has a smaller risk to the British population as a whole.

I appreciate you wont agree with ~~some~~ most of this, but does it sound unreasonable?

In my mind, a true Defensive Midfielder (Busquets, Matic, etc) forms two triangles on the field, one with the two Centerbacks and one with the two Central Midfielders. This way, he can provide a constant outlet to all four of these players. 

[por ejemplo](http://www.futbolforgringos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Barca.png)

When playing with two Central Midfielders, things can be slightly more difficult as the two CMs must be very in tune with each others movement. When Mason makes those darting runs forward in offense or makes the step to close down, Bentaleb has to slide across to the center to try and make up for the space, and this can be taken advantage of, as in UTD's first goal.

Also, if we have a true DM then he can drop between the CBs allowing the Fullbacks cover when they are pushed so far up the pitch.
I wrongly inferred that a true DM would force a formation change, but what I mean is that a true DM plays best with two CMs in front of him.

Offload ramires and find a real asset when either one is unavailable or jose tries to push fabregas up. All he is is pacy, poor shot selection and pass completion. I'll admit that he's been lifted by those around him so his form isn't as horrible as the past two years and he adds an energy. 

But surely there are physically fit players that can contribute key passes and outside shots? As well as more defensive discipline. If jose is so sold on pushing fabregas up as an AM (even though I personally think he's contributed more to our flow in the DM role) then look for a dynamic DM. Schneiderlin is an outstanding player proven in the league who would slot nicely next to matic. Then between hazard fabregas William and cuadrado we have a ton of versatility in the types of lineups we can use. 

I think we all expected DROGBA to be brief before entering a coaching role. Remy is still an asset and I do think pat bam has proven he's ready for a shot. BUT I don't know enough about the guy to say anything in comparison. 

So I think a decent DM and a replacement for the inevitable (painful) departure of cech means we need to invest there. I'm sure you could get a decent sale off of ramires.

They've blocked anything going through the middle and our wide outlets have been isolated. 

We need more than 1 person on each flank when attacking. I actually think going to a 433 would suit us against this Swansea set-up. 

Bring on Glen at RB, push Can into a holding CM role with Hendo and Allen ahead of him. Play Coutinho and Sterlng out wide and Studge through the middle.
