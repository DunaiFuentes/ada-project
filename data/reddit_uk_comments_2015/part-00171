Economics is about as useful as astrology. Less so since a random system of divination is probably more likely to produce some sort of reliable information.

The oft missed issue with the porn laws is that these restrictions do help to combat growing problems within the porn industry which the government (maybe) should tackle if it can. 

One example is scatological and/or urine porn (watersports). Whilst I completely agree that consenting adults should be able to do as they please the idea that porn is ever completely consensual overlooks a lot of nuance. Game theory is pretty apparent in porn because truth is people will get paid more for different things (usually the more *rare* stuff) and so when the sum of money you can make from extreme porn instead of *other, more vanilla* porn is so disproportionate you start asking how much consent **is** really involved. 

It might be the case that that's for the actors/industry to decide which would be the libertarian position (perfectly valid). But it may also be the place of the government to impose restrictions under the guise that it will help it's citizens (even pornstars are citizens) in the long term as they won't feel the economic pressure to do these things which can be dehumanising but their risk-reward calculus at the time can seem so skewed they don't factor in their long term well being.

Personally I think they overstepped somewhat and perhaps it could be better to regulate than draw red lines but I can imagine the difficulty in creating some sort of review board for every porn film made and so this was their work around.

Ultimately I hardly think it's proof of oppression or any kind of Orwellian view of authoritarianism.  ",null,0,null,1430952469,null,0,false,0,cr0ryof,null,t3_353tt6,null,t1_cr0ryof,null,t1_cr0rh17,null,null,null,1432813346,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's very complicated but I'll try. Everyone gets two votes.

One vote you use to vote for your local constituent candidate, same way Westminster elections work.

Second vote you use for a regional party. All constituencies are grouped into regions (8 per region I think) and the region has 7 seats.

*Who* gets those additional 7 regional seats is determined not just by the regional vote but it's share of the total voting electorate (in that region) and it's modified by the number of constituency seats that party won in the region.

It also goes in rounds. The numbers are run through and the first additional/regional seat of the 7 handed out through dividing the party vote total by the seats they have. Then comes round two where it all happens again, except now the party that won the seat in the previous round has it included in the division. So the more seats you have the harder and harder it gets to pick up more in each subsequent round.

It's called the [D'Hondt method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method). If you've got time you might want to read through [this document](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Research%20briefings%20and%20fact%20sheets/Scottish_Parliament_Electoral_System.pdf) that outlines exactly how it is used in Scotland.

If you don't though the example they use is quite good. In 2011 the SNP won 8 of 9 constituencies in the Lothian Region. They also got the most votes in the regional vote. Labour got the second most regional votes (and won the remaining constituency) whilst Tories came third in regional with no constituencies.

Once all that went through the calculation the SNP walked away with just the 8 constituency seats. Labour got their 1 constituency seat and 3 of the regional seats. The Tories with no constituency seats and 2 regional seats.

The greens and an independent both picked up the last 2 regional seats for coming 4th and 5th in the regional vote.

So ultimately even though SNP won 8/9 FPTP constituencies and came top of the regional list by 30,000 votes they only finished up with 8 of the 15 seats actually on offer in that region.

I'm not sure it'd even theoretically be possible to do it (a clean sweep), with the round system dividing chances by ever increasing amounts there must come a time where it doesn't matter what percentage of the vote you got.. the divider is too high to ever return a seat.",null,0,null,1430953125,null,0,1430953906,0,cr0sc9h,null,t3_353x70,null,t1_cr0sc9h,null,t3_353x70,null,null,null,1432813523,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

First, keep everything working as it is but all MPs and Lords would be chosen at random like juries. I would set the minimum age very low, fourteen or fifteen. I suppose a group of mathematicians could come up with some sort of algorithm that prevents very unrepresentative clusters of people being chosen at once (like a bunch of entitled public school sociopaths). This would instantly improve the quality of decision making and the integrity of government. 

I would then phase in direct democracy which allowed anyone to propose a measure that could be filtered through some sort of process and, if successful, voted on by citizens in referenda.

I do a similar thing to this as the rates have been better than some short term isas, it involves strict scheduling, the funds being available and you to be proactive (not a lecture, just advice).

I really like the TSB account as it requires no direct debits, but the amount you can earn 3% on is lower.

I'm sorry for being snippy - I didn't even read the second sentence of your original comment until 15 minutes after making my reply. I mistook your comment for typical anti-feminist snark, and I think that was perhaps unfair.

This story has been all over the internets for over a week, so I don't know where I learned he was a bloke, or even if I did make that assumption. I did think it was a one-man business until finding that DailyDot interview.

However, what you say is indeed ground that's been well-trodden by feminists - I'm sure you can find whole books discussing exactly what you wrote.

To the extent that your previous comment was genuine and and thoughtful, then, you yourself have disproved @proteinworld's claim that [""surely as feminists you understand that no one takes you seriously""](https://i.imgur.com/GqUC5wV.png) - these absolutely are feminist issues that you've examined.

I would be extremely surprised if [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0099861909/) ([short edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1784870412)) didn't address how women are the most critical of each other, or contrast male attitudes to body image.

[This browser extension](http://www.daniellesucher.com/2011/11/jailbreak-the-patriarchy-my-first-chrome-extension/) was written to confront readers with the assumptions we all tend to make about gender.

I'm not a feminist, or don't describe myself as such, but I think it gives us valuable ways to understand the way we behave, individually and collectively, and the complicated ways that gender issues are woven throughout the fabric of our society.

If there's one thing that I'd beg of you to understand about feminism, it's that these issues are not so black and white as ""sexism is wrong"" - male sexism is not the obverse to girls being bitchy about each others' appearance, both exist as parallel threads within the one rich tapestry that is our society.

Protein World and these magazines both use images of fit bodies simply because those sell more of their product - they'd sell less if they featured less attractive models, and that's as far as they see it.

But at the same time, I believe it's hypocritical bordering on vile of them to [imply that women's insecurities are their own fault,](http://i.imgur.com/TmWykuo.png) and not caused by this kind of advertising. When women are being catty about each others appearance, it's because they struggle to hold themselves to these beauty standards.

I don't have any quick and easy answers - I'm very tired, and I've spent over an hour now composing this comment, much of which I had to rewrite after accidentally closing my browser tab halfway through. I can imagine a feminist utopia in which no-one's mean to each other, but I can't change the world so that we can all happily get there.

I don't think feminism should be a *men vs women* issue, though. If the other girls at school were being nasty to your daughter about her appearance (or to your sister), then I think you'd be ready to criticise billboards and beauty magazines for making her feel worse about herself. I don't think you need to prove a relationship between the two things to be mad about them, and just because I observe these patterns as a problem doesn't mean I'm calling for a ban on lipstick or bikinis.

null,false,ctp95,lfc55,,null,"A few things. The first is that while I appreciate that revenue is king in modern football, and I know that FSG have done a great job in finding new overseas sources of revenue, a lot of it has come at the expense of matchgoing fans. I've never seen more complaints about the lack of atmosphere at Anfield, the support is fractured because of the manager and it all has a knock-on effect. There are steps the club could take like having a dedicated supporters/singing section like Celtic and Crystal Palace have, and altogether just being more attentive to the faithful who fill the stands and make the club great. 

Second, I would move as far away as possible from buying any player currently in the Premier League, unless they're free or near free, like Ings and Milner this summer. We get fleeced every time we try this and I personally think that ""Premier League-proven"" tends to be a lot of nonsense. The great Liverpool teams of the 2000s were built on academy graduates mixed with shrewd overseas buys. We've moved away from that now and with FFP in full effect it couldn't have come at a worse time. 

Third, have the transfer committee liquidated, literally if necessary. The discord over the transfers is obvious and extremely harmful. Rodgers' objections to working with a director of football should never have been taken seriously given how new he was to management. One should be hired and if Rodgers doesn't like it, well there's the door.

null,false,helix1512,null,null,null,"&gt; Not with Clegg as leader. Peelites/Orange Bookers etc. I guess not impossible but not as comfortable on economic matters.

This is the problem a lot of people have with politics. It's not based on pragmatism, it's based on childish factions. You're essentially making the argument that the one pledge they made to the PEOPLE is worth reneging on because Labour are further away ideologically on economic policy. Recall the Nick Clegg 'no more broken promises' political broadcast? That sentiment should have been more important than an Orange Booker not wanting to ally with a big spender. But no, economic concern was top dog as usual.

&gt; Just imagine the headlines.

of a Tory dominated media. Labour only won 7% less votes than Conservatives, and I would imagine a fair proportion of Lib Dem voters would have wanted anything but a ConDem coalition.

&gt; I agree he made a trade off. What people typically don't see is what was received in other areas.

I don't think a lot of people realised how close Clegg was to Cameron in terms of economic philosophy. There was so much focus on no tuition fees that people perceive Lib Dem policy successes as rolling over and lying down for Cameron.

&gt; it's impossible to have them providing the information 

I don't mean for them to provide info about the parties and policies etc., I mean to teach them that democracy IS for every day, to foster a sense of pride in taking part in politics, rather than current citizenship lessons, which having taken them 7 or 8 years ago, are a complete turn-off.

&gt; people here have a duty to try and keep up themselves

They do in theory yes, but I think mainstream political opinion vastly underestimates the influence of the media on how and what we learn. Government has a duty to promote a society where these values are instilled in us from a young age, and THEN its up to people to keep up themselves.

&gt; The cuts made the stimulus possible in the balance sheet context. Also, they voted for these representatives in the first place, so you can't really have it both ways. By voting, one is delegating these decisions to the state.

Spending cuts actually reduced growth so much that it undercut government revenue and made it harder to shrink the deficit. I'd be interested for you to read [this](http://benjaminstudebaker.com/2015/05/02/britain-for-the-love-of-god-please-stop-david-cameron/) and see if you still think that the cuts made the stimulus possible.. I know he's a little crude at times with his language ('do austerity') but see past that, he's trying to make it accessible to more than people with the technical jargon learnt.

&gt; Ultimately people believe whatever they want to believe -- like religion.

Very true, it really is the responsibility of the government then to make sure things like what happened with quantitative easing don't happen then, isn't it? I really can't see any justification for it. They knew where the money was going. Imagine if every family was actually given £24000.. You might say it would be a completely ludicrous idea but it wouldn't have turned out any more of a failure than quantitative easing.

&gt; if you put all cards on the table, people would switch off and get bored. It would be too technical, and they could just complain about tactful/deceitful use of jargon etc.

Which is why I simplified in my article, which you criticised me for!

&gt; I think what we're witnessing is that a new moral order has supplanted other ideologies.

Could you elaborate a little? Obviously I'm not saying there is no morality in politics, the point I was trying to make is that I feel legislature is too focused on economic gain and not enough on moral principles, and that there are certain individuals who take immoral advantage of their influence.

&gt; I think they're being told they aren't being properly represented by other groups interested in power, and interested in advocating their own sense of morality

You make a good point. I would be the first to admit that everyone has an agenda, including Russell Brand. But to me that sense of morality would at least have the end of greater compassion, equality, and unity, so the ends justify the means. A slippery slope of course..
&gt; 'the status quo' is a concept made up for political purposes

I can see how you might think that, but understand that when someone from my perspective says those words, theyre generally referring to a first past the post system with centrism as the only option (surely you can't deny that in the last 50 years, labour and conservatives have bunched up tighter), and a media that tries to entrench that system.

&gt; As a centrist it's these sorts of dichotomies that get on my nerves, but it can often be hard to explain because like with the Lib Dems, people easily confuse a flexible, pragmatic realism, with spinelessness and lack of fixed principles. Really the fixed principle is in trying to find bipartisan solutions to complex problems often simplified into restraining, polarized dichotomies.

I like this idea - of course it feeds back into the idea that people switch off when you try to explain that to them. If the (not completely) false dichotomies galvanise people to be active participators in democracy, is that such a bad thing?

&gt; I think we're all biased, which is important to bear in mind regardless of which 'side' one lands on.

Completely correct. The facts of life have become so complex now that it really is hard to actually find those facts, especially in the media. I just hope that pragmatism and empiricism don't get lost along the way..

The Ninth Doctor speaks in what I feel are pretty clear terms.

From The End of The World:

&gt; DOCTOR: You think it'll last forever, people and cars and concrete, but it won't. One day it's all gone. Even the sky. My planet's gone. It's dead. It burned like the Earth. It's just rocks and dust.

In this he is distinctly referring to the way he saw Gallifrey destroyed and compares it to how the Earth just got destroyed. It is burned, just rocks and dust. This is pretty specific.

And then later in Dalek:

&gt; DOCTOR: They're never going to come! Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out in one second. 

&gt; DALEK: You lie! 

&gt; DOCTOR: I watched it happen. I made it happen. 

&gt; DALEK: You destroyed us? 

&gt; DOCTOR: I had no choice. 

&gt; DALEK: And what of the Time Lords? 

&gt; DOCTOR: Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost. 

He specifically refers to watching it happen. Not being there one minute and then everything was gone the next. Not everything being gone in the blink of an eye.

Even in the 50th Ten and Eleven show it is pretty clear that they know they are changing events:

&gt; Tenth Doctor: You're not actually suggesting that we change our own personal history? 

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse. 

&gt; War Doctor: What, exactly? 

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. I've changed my mind.

He doesn't think at this Moment oh maybe I never destroyed Gallifrey because we saved it, he thinks I am going to change my mind. I am going to change the decision I made.

&gt;General: Which it isn't, why would you do such a thing? 

&gt;Eleventh Doctor: Because the alternative is burning.

&gt;Tenth Doctor: And I've seen that.

&gt;Eleventh Doctor: And I never want to see it again.

And as with Nine both Ten and Eleven refer to ""seeing"" Gallifrey burn and don't want to ""see"" it again so obviously what they are about to do will look nothing like what happened then. They obviously have a memory to compare it too.

As for the Doctor surviving the destruction, The Moment easily could have saved the Doctor from Gallifrey and even says it would do so while he is planning to use her on Gallifrey.",null,0,null,1430957296,null,0,false,0,cr0unm9,null,t3_351mhp,null,t1_cr0unm9,null,t1_cr0nbwu,null,null,null,1432814614,null,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

The current government carries on until they're either voted out &amp; a new government formed or the PM resigns.

Apologies, I misread the tone of your question and thought you were being dismissive.

&gt; It's not really clear how this one particular example is arrived at.
I'm a bit dubious as to how the catch up services of a regional broadcaster could actually come under EU oversight.

Personally, I think it's a great idea that we should have started implementing a long time ago, because the ability to manage this kind of stuff globally is a very complicated and time-consuming task. It's obvious that the way these services are growing and scrambling to deal with DRM with all the different laws and policies and restrictions, the right thing to do is to just settle on one (or a few) central systems. 

For my own two cents, I'd prefer it if companies just released content and services globally all at once so this faffing about didn't have to happen at all, and I ultimately think this is the way the market will take it - but I imagine it would still be done through some kind of 'system' rather than just random local-licensing. Obviously not every content provider is concerned with global distribution at all, but consumers of that content shouldn't be prevented from accessing it just because they flew somewhere else. I'm of the opinion that everything will be digitised and accessible sooner or later - we might as well make life easier for ourselves.",null,0,null,1430958371,null,0,false,0,cr0v81c,null,t3_351ohv,null,t1_cr0v81c,null,t1_cr0u330,null,null,null,1432814882,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That doesn't make sense. It is becoming a topic recently. I studied theories that came from the Frankfurt School when I was at college and never regarded it as anything but a bunch of Marxist-based drivel - boring and irrelevant to the real world. That was my opinion of it. Now it seems to be a topic where people are arguing that it was the origin of all politically correct thought. I have eyes - I have read and seen articles about this. Did I not see them? Is that what you're saying?

The point is the Frankfurt School is most definitely now a point of discussion where people are arguing that it was the origin of things such as race issues, feminism, gay rights etc. That the idea of the traditional family was deconstructed.

As you said - ""Any collected set of ideas"". The Frankfurt School? Also a collected set of ideas.

And how can we disagree that most of the people involved in it were not Jews? They were. And that Jews overpresent in certain groups? There are certain industries where Jews kind of control the whole damn thing. Hollywood? And yet Gary Oldman says this and has to issue an apology for saying it.

It wasn't so much as a straight run through, but more of a ""watch in order what I've not watched already"" and even though, The Dalek Master Plan got me stuck for a good several weeks.

I found it very helpful to jump around a bit. Sticking only to B+W for 1-2 months, maybe more, is tough and may just kill it for you. I generally recommend people to start 1 and 3 (in colour) simultaneously and alternate. They're almost two different shows anyway.

Frankly, watching it exactly in order is of very little importance when you just want to watch them all, at least for classics. There's little connection between serials anyway, especially between 1/2 and 3+. I'd consider it more important to watch it all than to get it done in order.

Here is an interview with John Kiriakou, an ex CIA guy who explains how Bush and Cheney might very well have made a considerable contribution to the 911 attack. I would recommend seeing the whole thing, it's fucking revealing. But this is the bit you need to see:

I don't.

For one Obamacare was not just making insurance mandatory, but it truly centralised a national healthcare *skeleton*, because it certainly isn't a system yet. However, you can no longer get fucked by insurance companies for having pre-existing conditions and the subsidies reduced the cost of insurance. This is **huge** for two reasons:

* When you consider that in 2010, [16.3% of all Americans were uninsured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States#Uninsured_rates_by_state), that is **50 million people** whose lives could be utterly wrecked by an accident; their lack of insurance being down to a number of completely unfair reasons

* He managed to fend off Republican majorities in Congress while implementing it

&gt; How about asking who was president when man first stepped foot on the moon? who worked to end the Cuban missile crisis? Who did the most for civil rights? Who got the US through WW2 and the Great Depression?

It seems quite unfair to compare wartime Presidents to peacetime ones but how about not ending the Cuban missile crisis, but instead ending the anachronistic absence of American-Cuban relations with the [Cuban Thaw?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Thaw)

What about pulling out of a disastrous war started by his predecessor?  Killing public enemy number one in Bin Laden?

If we're talking about civil rights, why not mention the repealing the absurd [Don't Ask Don't Tell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Ask,_Don%27t_Tell_Repeal_Act_of_2010) policy in the US military, that managed to find its way into the 21st century.

And in what context did he do all this in? The **Great Recession** out of all things. A recession that his stimulus packages pulled his country out of and into storming growth for the GDP, while we haven't even left pre-crisis levels.

&gt; Obama's name will go down in Presidential history, but sadly I think it's going to be on his skin colour alone, with smaller mention of his contributions.

No doubt Obama was elected due to a winning complexion, but the amount he's managed to achieve while trying to work with a Republican congress all during the aftermath of the worst global recession since WWII is absolutely admirable in my view. I don't think *even the Republicans* will be remembering him for his skin colour anymore, more for how he violently, yet successfully, began demolishing the backwards institutions that the Republicans held so dear.",null,0,null,1430959676,null,0,1430959964,0,cr0vzmv,null,t3_351m75,null,t1_cr0vzmv,null,t1_cr0fjpw,null,null,null,1432815243,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

1) Ms Yap bought a second-hand car from Audi for £20k.


2) Before she had a chance to pick it up, a truck drove into it, while on Audi's forecourt.


3) Audi said they'd graciously fix the car for free and she could have dinner on them for the inconvenience of having to wait. (It doesn't state here if they would offer her a refund of the wrecked car or not).


4) Ms Yap decides to take the piss and run up a huge bill at the restaurant, possibly because she's annoyed that they wrecked her car. Possibly because of the loss of value of said vehicle from being damaged.


I don't know, but 20k for an Audi that's been driven into by a truck doesn't sound like that great a deal. You never know if they've missed some structural damage.

Greens are offering to put the most into the NHS, depends if you think they'll get in in your area. 


Labour have always put more money into the NHS than conservatives (but maybe we had more money to do that).


NHS budget since 1994:

Liberal Democrats might be a good choice, but they have lost a lot of popularity.


Conservatives would be good if you're rich and don't care about social mobility. (OK, I'm a bit bias. But hey if you're rich or run a business and want to keep your money, they're the party for you). They'd probably try and further privitise the NHS, which may or may not be good for your mum. Most doctors I know love the NHS and are very protective of it.

So my Dad liked the colours claret and blue and liked Palace's jersey, but my uncle said they weren't very good and he wouldn't want to support them. My Dad then asked about West Ham, they wore claret and blue and were a London club. It was late 1964 and West Ham had just won the FA cup so my uncle said they were a good club and so my Dad settled on West Ham, making him possibly the only glory hunter West Ham supporter ever.

They met at the Boleyn Pub and 10 years later, here I am.

But I believe that to defeat a foe you must first understand them, and your understanding of the situation is limited, and in the case of Northern Ireland it's frankly absurd. Catholics are a minority in NI, and one that was discriminated against for decades, so claiming that the government of NI has a habit of pleasing the Catholic church shows a gross misunderstanding of the history and culture of that country. The largest party in NI, and the one most opposed to legalising abortion, are supported by the Protestant community.

As for the Republic of Ireland, while the Catholic church did hold a great deal of sway here up until the 1990s, their influence has vastly eroded since then. Polls show that the majority of people in Ireland do want the laws on abortion liberalised to some extent, the reason why progress on this issue has been so slow is due to plain old boring politics. For complex historical reasons, the two main parties here are both centre-right and contain liberal and conservative wings within them. If whichever party is in power did attempt to liberalise abortion law then they would face an internal split from their more conservative members, something the leadership of both parties prefers to avoid. In 2013, in the wake of the death of Savita Halappanavar, the government did bring in a very limited change to abortion law, but even that minor change led to several high-profile members of the ruling party splitting off, which was internally very damaging for them.

Simply put, abortion is the third rail of Irish politics, and the party that touches the issue gets hurt.

Not that I think this is a over prescription problem per say as in my experience doctors are often too stringent with their prescriptions. I think its more due to the fact that lyrica is seen as less troublesome than benzos and tramadol isn't something pharm heads would be after so we see them prescribed more.

This is bugging me a bit, though I'm not entirely sure why this is the thing I've chosen to care about.

Minimums is the 'more correct' plural form in this case, partly just because it's the linguistic norm and also to an extent due to the use of both in technical language.

Minima are low dips in a contiguous data set. That is to say that if represented on a line graph, distinct troughs are the graph's minima. 

While the deepest of the minima is the minimum, it's not relevant here because your subject is discrete. The established lowest sentence for each crime is ostensibly separate, so there's no collective of troughs. It's not particularly meaningful to talk about the lowest sentences as minima, because those low points bear no relation, and don't exist in a continuum.

&gt; You don't say mate. Is he really comparing pre-war, pre-NHS Britain to today as a point about how people on benefits should thank their lucky stars?

&gt; He goes on to state the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer can't be true because of some figures he gives no reference for and because Karl Marx said it so it must be bollocks. His final argument that capitalism has saved the world reeks of the sort of smug self-satisfaction of someone who's never put himself in someone else's shoes.

So nothing there you'd comment on? What about the fact he provides no sources for anything he says? 

The Karl Marx quote he rubbishes for no other reason than because he said it? His argument that capitalism saved the world and increased living standards despite the fact the NHS has hardly proved to be a failure, something he's so ardently against.

There's certain aspects of Libertarianism I think a lot of people agree with, free speech, general anti-war stuff, legalisation of drugs. But the best way to win an argument against a Libertarian is to let them keep talking.

You should also have an actual marketable skill, something that a client would actually be looking for. 

It's all well and good to say that you manage a minecraft server or have built your own PC, but be real; nobody will employ you for those skills. If i were a looking for a custom built computer, i'd go to a company with a good track record and a warranty.

What you should do, if you really want to go down this route, is become VERY friendly with the basics of web design and coding. Once again, i only started getting work when i could show examples of complicated features like booking forms, timetabling tools, and responsive and dynamic design. Even things like app development are important.

Consequently, he's able to make far more critical interceptions and tackles than Pogba — even if those aren't his primary responsibility — while his movement off the ball going forward is also better IMO. In fact, Pogba often goes missing for long periods between his moments of brilliance, which to me suggests somewhat poor off the ball movement. 

Verratti also seems harder to dispossess — he's a lot like Nasri in that regard actually, he can hold on to the ball in advanced areas under considerable pressure long enough for an option to open up. Pogba is very good at this as well, and because he relies more on strength than skill, would perhaps be better suited to this role in the premier league, but it's definitely something that Verratti is uniquely capable of.

Both are great at passing, and are phenomenal with the ball at their feet. Verratti is probably better at the former, but Pogba really is a talent to behold when he's on the ball. He's also an excellent shot, whereas Verratti doesn't seem to be much of a goal threat.

Veratti can win possession, retain possession, and create chances with possession, whereas Pogba really only creates, and to some degree retains. Moreover, while Verratti creates chances through passing ability and off the ball movement, Pogba relies more on individual skill — dribbling and shooting ability — to create chances.  

There's no doubt that both are excellent players, but Verratti is a much more rounded midfielder in my mind, and much more the kind of player we need. I feel as though the nature of Pogba's talents are much more easily identifiable, and as a result I feel he can be slightly overrated.

null,false,vln,null,null,null,"Cut-and-pasting my fairly long reply in another thread which asked about the lack of any ID requirement for voting, and what there is to stop somebody claiming to be other people in order to vote more than once:

&gt; Firstly, you're going to be clocked if you turn up at the same polling station multiple times. So you'd need to be visiting different ones. To have more than a minuscule chance of swinging a result in the first-past-the-post system, you'd need lots of co-conspirators, all visiting lots of polling stations. Independently, mind, turning up on a coach and piling into the polling station would ring alarm bells with the staff! Then you'd need to be very confident in your accurate list of people who definitely will not be voting, because turning up and claiming to be somebody who has already voted triggers a specific procedure (tendered ballots), and a spike in the numbers of tendered ballots would trigger a serious investigation.

&gt; All that effort and risk, and you might influence the election of one MP....

&gt; Why no ID and no polling card? It's the principle of maximum enfranchisement.

&gt; Requiring the polling card would exclude those who have not received theirs, or have lost it, and this number of people is likely to be far greater than those potentially committing in-person fraud. There would also be added complexity and cost in requiring forgery-proof polling cards, too, and staff who can accurately assess their security.

&gt; More important, though, is those people who have no ID, or who have no access to it. This would disproportionately discriminate against particular segments of the population, most of whom are especially vulnerable - the poor, the homeless, victims of domestic violence or other abuse (preventing access to personal documents being a common feature of domestic abuse, so such people would probably not have access to their polling card either), and so on.

I know you asked for finance info but my view is if you can avoid retaking the year that will be the best option, chances are it doesn't go towards your final classification anyway. With that in mind this is my advice as a university lecturer and tutor.

You should also arrange a tutorial to sit down and talk through things with your personal tutor. They won't be able to help with the finance but should be able to help with the ""how badly have I screwed up and what are my options?"" side.  If you wait until the uni is sends you a letter telling you that you have failed modules their options are limited because they will have been through a board of studies.  Depending on how much and why it's gone wrong there are options like resubmission, resits etc. Read through your uni's regulations (if they aren't in your handbook they should be on the intranet). They should have a part where it explains what happens when you fail modules and how many credits you can fail before they remove the option of retakes. It should will also tell you how much the retake fee is and if it is caped.

Speaking as a tutor, students who don't come see us when it's going wrong always end up worse off than those who do.

Someone with tons of money can invest most of their money on assets with high RoI, and they spend less of their money on essential services as a proportion of their wealth. If you wanted to model income as a differential equation, d(wealth)/dt = k(m*wealth + c) - e, where m is the return on investment on someone's wealth, 1-k is their rate of taxation, c is a persons wage, and e is their living expenses. If you solve for wealth, you'd get exponential growth in time. This means that the person who already has money will make more money even with the same wage, and how much more money they have will dictate how much quicker their money will grow. That is to say the richer get richer at a faster rate unless taxation is sufficiently progressive to counteract the effect. To do that, k would have to equal b/wealth, where b is some constant, so tax rate would be 1-b/wealth (which, hint, it is nowhere close to, and for good reason).

I think you mean 8 regions, rather than 8 per region? 

&gt; The numbers are run through and the first additional/regional seat of the 7 handed out through dividing the party vote total by the seats they have.

It's the party vote total divided by the number of seats they have **plus one**. So for example in the North East region where I live, the SNP won all 10 constituencies, so their vote share was divided by 11, while everyone else's was divided by 1. So Labour got the first seat, and so it's SNP/11, Lab/2 everyoneelse/1 and then you go onto round two :-) 

So to win *all* the seats, you would have to get to a point where in the last round your share of the vote, divided by 17, was larger than the party who were second. That would be... Something. lol

Pros:

- Economically centrist. They'd eliminate the deficit but are willing to use tax rises as well as spending cuts to avoid the most socially regressive cuts the Tories have planned. They also don't aim at an economically wasteful surplus. 

- They take climate change seriously without having the crazy policies of the Greens. Pro-nuclear, pro-wind power, pro highly regulated fracking.

- Pro EU, pro-immigration

- £8bn increase in the NHS annual budget by 2020, over and above the rate of inflation, to help meet the NHS funding gap being caused by the ageing population.

- Support decriminalisation of cannabis.

- Supports Proportional Representation and House of Lords reform.

- Plan to build 300,000 houses a year by 2020.

- Progressive overhaul of Council Tax.

Cons:

- Wants to cut defence spending below the 2% of GDP NATO requires (by including humanitarian aid within the defence budget to fudge the numbers).

My dad advised me to call local companies in the yellow pages and ask them if they would be interested in meeting to discuss any support or new functionality they were interested in exploring for their website. I was absolutely terrified of doing this and suggested emailing instead. He insisted I called and I'm glad I did. I wrote down my opener, read it out in a trembling voice, and found everyone to be super friendly over the phone. It quickly started getting easy. Everyone I spoke to had advice for me. Told me other people I should try calling. It was amazing. As my first job, I ended up developing a basic online shopping cart solution for a local electronic reseller. I didn't even have a portfolio at the time. Doing this led me to a lucrative teenage career as a web developer which funded my way through uni. Up until I graduated uni, and moved into research. 

Mind you. This was 15 years ago. Crap websites and companies without websites were common. But I still stand by this advice. Can't hurt to speak to local small businesses offering your services and finding what their pain points are. You don't need to sort out the following now, but before you start working make sure you're clear about your pricing, decide how much you charge upfront vs on delivery, sign a contract, agree on project scope and that you invoice correctly, following-up on non payments. It sounds like a lot but there are quite a few online invoicing solutions and contract templates that make things easier. 

You'll also want to look into registering as self employed. Gov.uk has some good advice on this: https://www.gov.uk/working-for-yourself.

&gt;Dogs may not yet be entitled to vote but they are allowed to come and watch as long as they don't disrupt the vote. Before the 2008 London Mayoral election polling staff were issued with advice stating that dogs had to be in an ""accompanying"" role rather than ""free-range"". In cases where a voter has two or more dogs and will struggle to control them while casting their ballot, polling station staff may be able to hold the dogs' leads. Rural constituencies might have cases of voters riding to the polling station. In such cases, horses and ponies should be tethered up outside.

I'm not discrediting what Obama may have achieved in office, just as numerous others in the 44 that have existed - but how much of that is going to be remembered in 25 years, 50 years, 100?

Can you tell me without googling what good Jimmy Carter achieved in office? Don't bother answering me, the truth of the answer is in what is or isn't common knowledge and in your immediate ability to cite a defining moment.

What defining thing can you tell me about Nixon without looking it up?

See, the point is, Jimmy Carter was a good president, as good as Obama, but not memorable. Yet Nixon is memorable, and ironically not for putting a man on the moon like a previous commenter's correction above. It works negatively too.

What defining moments are people (all people of all political views) going to remember and associate to Obama?

I don't think Obama has many defining moments that most people are going to recall to their grandchildren beyond ""I was there when they elected the first black president"" - then some of the more politically aware might be inclined to recite one or two of the things you have - but it's just not that memorable to the average person.",null,0,null,1430985375,null,0,false,0,cr1705m,null,t3_351m75,null,t1_cr1705m,null,t1_cr0vzmv,null,null,null,1432820515,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It depends on what you want: 

As Thestolenone says, young people go to Xscape, and there is an outlet shopping centre opposite it.

For cities- Wakefield is close and has good modern art gallery, and cathedral, but isn't great really otherwise.

Leeds has more and is still very easy to get to.

Otherwise:

Fairburn: bird reserve

Ledsham: Chequers- traditional English pub

Best curry we know is at Aagrah (Wakefield or Doncaster are nearest branches for you)

Nice place to eat, 3 Acres at Shelley near the TV mast, but you need a car.

Blacker Hall just beyond Wakefield is a good farm shop and cafe, better than Farmer Copley's which is just outside Pontefract.

A) He resigns.
B) The Commons passes a vote of no confidence.

By convention, the Prime Minister resigns when another party gains a majority in the Commons, in anticipation of a no confidence vote. Better to leave with dignity rather than be forced out.

If the election delivers a Labour majority, Cameron will follow convention and resign.

If the election delivers a hung Parliament, Cameron will stay in office until he is voted out by the Commons, or until it becomes clear that such a vote is inevitable and he resigns to avoid it (as Brown did, following the Tory-LibDem deal in 2010).

If Labour and the SNP have a majority between them but do not form a coalition, Cameron might try to govern as a minority government rather than resign, if he believes Labour and the SNP to be sufficiently at odds. This is completely legitimate. It is not a coup. If a majority of the Commons delivers a vote of no confidence, Cameron still has to leave office. But if Labour and the SNP fail to coordinate and vote Cameron out, then it's constitutionally correct for Cameron to stay in office.

Cameron is free to use whatever political ideology he likes to persuade people that the SNP should not coordinate with Labour to vote him out. One such ideology would be an appeal against nationalism. Making such an appeal is not a coup, it's a political viewpoint. Because, again, if people reject his argument and vote him out, he still has to leave.

Be prepared for a lot of heartbreaks and rollercosters. If you want a team that is consistently challenging for the title, you're looking at the wrong team. We strive for fourth place which is a place in the prestigious and lucrative Champions League. Unfortunately, competition is an all time high with Liverpool, Southampton, Everton and us all competing for that spot.

Remember, anything can happen. We beat table leaders Chelsea 5-3 and yet be lost to relegation candidates Aston Villa 1-0. It happens to every team, but more so to Spurs. Sometimes it can get a bit frustrating.

We aren't a team to spend. There have been reports of us switching up our squad by having a big sale of many (up to 8) of our players. I do not doubt this, but it is uncommon for teams to bring in as many players. Spurs is a team that strives not only for Champions League but also for financial stability so don't expect any mega signings in the region of 30 or 40 million pounds.

This year has been pretty good. Unlike last year where expectations were high due to the arrival of 7 new players after the sale of our superstar Gareth Bale to Real Madrid (in Spain). Last year we sacked two manager (Andre-Villas Boas who now manages Zenit St. Petersburg in the Russian Premier League and Tim Sherwood who manages Aston Villa). This year our manager is Mauricio Pochettino who was previously in an overperforming Southampton (less so compared to this season). 

We aren't particularly angry at anything. Our squad is young and we're playing good football again so there's a lot of hope for the future, but there's still a lot of work to be done.

Our most consistent player is our goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. If Kane was Jesus, Lloris would be the Father and Eriksen the Holy Spirit.",null,0,null,1430989166,null,0,false,0,cr17tx6,null,t3_352dws,null,t1_cr17tx6,null,t3_352dws,null,null,null,1432820904,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

I have looked at regular savings accounts; it seems that should I ever need that money it would close the account/stop the good interest rate. 
Because I don't have any savings as of yet, the benefit of 2k in the TSB for me is that it can be used as emergency funds should it ever need to. 
Though when I have enough saved as an emergency fund and can spare money to be dripped into a regular savings I will do so ASAP. (at least I think thats the plan)

Question: Is it better for me to open multiple current accounts or use regular savings accounts? Or is it entirely dependent on the interest rates/benefits of each in question?

The different is subtle but important: in the past, a government could lose confidence by failing to pass something. Now, a government can only lose confidence by actively being voted out.

But of course, politically speaking, failing to pass a Queen's Speech may lead a government to see the writing on the wall and resign. But it's no longer *expected* that they will do so.

&gt; I don't see the merit to society of massive amounts of useless, expensive degrees

The merit of a degree is not necessarily the merit of the specific subject matter. Degrees in general teach people how to analyse, and organise their thoughts, how to express them clearly on paper and/or out loud, how to form a logical argument, how to gather, investigate and assess material, and so on, so the benefits aren't just the benefits of having one more historian in the country - most people who do a history degree won't go on to be historians, in the same way that most people who do a maths degree don't go on to be professors of mathematics.

In addition not everyone can be a gifted scientist or engineer: What do you suggest people who aren't gifted that way do after school if they still want to learn more? Just give up?

Also just because something is an academic subject doesn't mean it has no merit either to its students or society at large.   
  
There's also the question of what you mean by ""merit"" - what measurement of merit are we using? Economic? Educational? Societal? How are we going about making that measurement? Using what criteria, what tools?   
  
For another, just because you don't see the merit in something doesn't mean it has none. Maybe you need to look harder or evaluate merit using different criteria?

**BTW I meant there are over 400 food banks in the country now not just 400 people need them oops!**

It's a false dichotomy to say they're either in work and exploited or just not in work. You can't force employers to hire people but you can empower them to do so by providing say tax cuts for businesses paying the living wage (Labour pledge) or any number of state supports. If I'm being honest I'd actually prefer a system that could help support people searching for decent work than one which pressured them into exploitative situations. (Some of the horror stories you hear like the one Paxman put to Cameron are becoming far too frequent now).

With regards to wealth and power the problem is that it's centred around London and every other part of the country sees no benefit. (HS2 being classified as a UK project meaning no money devolved to Wales as agreed under The Barnett Formula is an example of the unfairness people see).

The country which is supposed to see more spread out (in terms of geography) wealth and power is our own. We have devolved assemblies yet the net result is the same, the SE is fine whilst we all suffer. The system I'd propose is heavy investment in other parts of the country outside London. Investment in the North, Scotland and Wales. My MP David Davies when asked about work opportunities for youth in Wales (which is dire btw) and what he would do about it said ""nothing"" and that people should just move to where the work is. It might be a tolerable position to most but I think Wales can be more than the place where the English go to retire and will never improve with MPs with Davids attitude.

As for the NHS it's largely anecdotal I'll admit, ultimately though the Tories have no reservations about privatising sections of it and [Labour will undo this](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/andrew-gwynne/nhs-election-2015_b_7204808.html).

My guess is that they are predicting a Tory bump in the polling booth where I am not really. This may well happen. My map is more of an 'if the polls are right' model.

Yougov nowcast and the Guardian are very close to my numbers. My prediction is comfortably within the error bounds of the election forecast model and they are saying labour have a 33 % chance of most seats despite predicting a conservative 15 seat lead. There is huge uncertainty in this election.

edit - one of the most interesting seats for me is Brighton Kemptown where Conservatives had a 3.1% majority last time. I'm forecasting Labour to take it by 9% which is in line with the swing I'm finding in the South East - slighty larger probably due to the Ashcroft poll there in January - http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2015/01/brighton-kemptown/

Election Forecast have it as a Conservative hold with barely any change from 2010 (0.5% or so) and I'm not sure how they got that conclusion. I feel may be overestimating the Labour gains in the South East and South West somehow.

Nearby Hove where Con had a higher majority (3.75) last time is being forecasted as a 4% Labour win by EF which is far more in line with a 4%ish swing.

null,false,DearTereza,null,null,null,"I read this comment late at night, and it troubled me. So last night and today I did some more research on this, and you're right - it was a promise, and he did break it.

I also read his reasoning, and [apology](http://http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nick-clegg-apologies-tuition-fees-pledge), and looked at how things have changed since. It's interesting. He outright apologised for promising something he couldn't realistically deliver, despite being urged not to apologise by people within his party.

I'm in 2 minds about this. On one hand, I think it's a bit lame. Apologising isn't a panacea and there is no guarantee the same thing won't happen again over a different 'red line' issue. They've set plenty out for this election and it's a leap to ask people to believe them.

On the other hand, it's nice to see a politician actually acknowledge fault and try to do better, and the 'red line' pledges this time seem both more believable, and more likely to work as other parties know the Lib Dems have a lot at stake and won't budge this time, they can't risk the backlash. If they did it again, the party would likely have to be dissolved as they'd lose all their remaining seats next time around. The future of their party is at stake if they don't keep their word.

I do think you have to cut some slack for minority parties in coaltion due to their lack of voting power, but the owness is also on them to not make promises they can't realistically keep. I think the [actual effect the Lib Dems had on the Coalition](http://http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/) was positive - they softened the blow of austerity without getting in its way. With a tiny number of seats, they did what they could. But there was a promise and it was broken, and that is nobody but Nick Clegg's fault, which I acknowledge despite generally liking the man.

So yeah, I was both misinformed and disingenuous, and though I've not changed my positive view of the party, I do feel it's important to be truthful about what happened.",null,0,null,1430993616,null,0,false,0,cr18qv1,null,t3_34z7jl,null,t1_cr18qv1,null,t1_cr0bg4u,null,null,null,1432821335,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That means if you think you want a scale and polish, you can pay privately. If your dentist is saying one is necessary, then he should do it himself (or get the Hygienist to do it) under the NHS as a Band 1 treatment.

first off, what you already have is impressive. for this to be the product of a 14 year old is something to be proud of. Most adults can't match this.

i agree with a lot of the ""remove furry"" comments.  i don't think it's terribly embarrassing, but bear in mind that anyone who knows what a furry is will already have a pc and decent tech knowledge. your prospective clients won't know what your talking about and it will create more questions than answers..

in terms of building up business, i am not an expert, but something you should consider is offering your skills for free to begin with and do build up a portfolio.  i guarantee that your parents/relatives/family friends know people who have small businesses (or are members of sports/hobby clubs) who would like some web presence, but can't afford to pay much.  start by asking around and offering your services in exchange for pocket money / server costs or something and ramp up from there. 

same sort of approach with the hardware side.

In a multi-party system each party roughly equates to a percentage of the population who thinks that way (Yes a different voting system would do this better), then it is the job of the politicians to decide on the best solution that will satisfy the greatest proportion of people as represented by party policies. You end up with higher acceptance rates than in a simple majority, although no one party or simple majority gets to dictate resulting in a possible centrist final bill.  

This is similar to the each MP is in effect independent as it has a higher focus on negotiation rather than forcing through bills, either we have a multi party system (which is faster and simpler) to organise negotiations or a individual system which is slightly more representative but is much slower and some MP's will loose out from having any say at all.

I think the NHS could use the extra money.

If implemented correctly this is the most sensible plan on immigration.

 The reason UKIP want to remove inheritance tax is because it stops the rich getting richer. And because (some) people are avoiding a law, the law should be removed?

Australia has a terrible immigration system, and I doubt UKIP would be able to use the same system to make it any better.

Vague and not unique to UKIP. also fair share of tax is most likely in regard to reducing the amount of tax paid.

As well as that it sets up a system where anyone who cant afford health care can't even visit the country

Have you ever been to any other country? You usually need heal insurance or risk having to pay for treatment. I am very surprised you find this point so despicable since its used around the world already.

&gt; Australia has a terrible immigration system, and I doubt UKIP would be able to use the same system to make it any better.

I don't necessarily agree with this. I assume its just opinion but it makes the most logical sense to me to only have people enter the country with the specific things you need inside the country.

&gt;The reason UKIP want to remove inheritance tax is because it stops the rich getting richer. And because (some) people are avoiding a law, the law should be removed?

I'm sorry i don't believe a death tax is a good way to go about it. You are free to have your own opinion but the law is only there so the people who don't prepare for it get fucked. (which most rich people prepare for years in advance so it does nothing anyway)

&gt; Up until very recently the majority of the British public thought the death penalty should be legal, direct democracy is not inherently a good system especially when so few people are educated on the topic and have been led by the media to believe EU = EVIL.

Giving people no choice because you don't trust them is not the way i want the government to be operating. Especially on something as big as the EU. There are points for and against the EU its not as simple as completely wrong or right.

This is probably true, but TheGodBen's point is that you're radically misunderstanding **why** that is the case - you're conflating the situation in the republic with that of the north, when the situations are actually very different.  In the north, the major barrier to abortion (and indeed, many other of the more liberal stances on various issues) is primarily due to pandering to conservative *Protestant* elements, rather than Catholics.  It's the Protestant unionist parties that are the major blockers, as both major unionist parties pander heavily to very consevative religious elements (in particular, the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by Ian Paisley, who also founded the DUP).

(Not that the nationalist parties are all in favour mind you, but they're often actually moreso than the unionist ones, with Sinn Fein's position being that of allowing abortion for medical reasons and in the case of rape, and in the past has vetoed a move to ban the Marie Stopes clinic from performing abortions).",null,0,null,1430997734,null,0,false,0,cr19rhi,null,t3_351ov2,null,t1_cr19rhi,null,t1_cr0y37j,null,null,null,1432821815,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Interesting that you mention learning about the history, as it's no exaggeration to say that we are one of the most historic clubs in the world - our formation and early years had a huge influence on the game of modern football that we know today. Not only were we one of the first clubs ever formed, our chairman invented league football and our successful trophy-winning teams of the first few decades were hailed across the globe, seen by many as the pioneers of 'passing football'. 

Sure, recent years battling at the bottom have not been kind, but make no mistake - we are a sleeping giant and without doubt one of the finest clubs in English football.

null,false,try_____another,null,null,null,"Australia uses STV (specifically the Hare-Clark system, which is an improvement over the Hare system described by /u/twersx), with one electorate for each state. Their electoral commission [describes it fairly well](http://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/senate_count.htm), but in summary the difference is that instead of randomly choosing which excess votes to pass on, all of the ballots are considered but at a fraction of their value.

That is, if candidate A gets twice as many first-preference votes as needed to be elected, in Hare half of the papers have their second preferences counted, whereas in Hare-Clark all of the second preferences are counted but only as half a vote each.

Goalkeepers:

Myhill - Welsh and backup level to Fab.  Wages probably won't be ridiculous.

Amos - Man U prospect who arguably should have been given a chance for them by now.  Should probably go to a newly promoted side or loaned to championship to gain experience.  Would like him but it's not likely.


Defenders - 

Garbutt to challenge Taylor would be good.  Plus he is also young so time to develop.

Figueroa - Older so would be temporary but would give us a more physical option at left back.

Midfield:  None of the guys in this list are needed.

Attackers:

Kakuta - Promising young winger who never really stood a chance at Chelsea (Much like Sinclair).  Hear rumours Monaco are in for him though who we couldn't compete with on wages.

Sinclair - Well I'd love to see him back at the Liberty but not if we have to pay more than we did before on wages.

James Wilson - has looked like a solid young player with a lot of potential.  Maybe one to grab on loan as cover if not on a free?

When I was in college (UK college 16-18), my friend made most of his money by doing web sites for people.  You need example sites, and you need to pick projects that are suitable to your work level.  But you have two advantages:  You can work much cheaper than most other people (i.e. you don't have rent/food/etc to pay for), and most small business owners have no idea how much a site is worth/how much time it can take.  

Another way he made money, and I'm not sure on the legality of this where you live, is to do drop shipping.  Basically you find a cheap importer of goods, and you sell them on something like ebay at a small mark up.  When you get an order, you just make the order on behalf of the buyer.

They could if they wanted to go the entire 5 year term not letting Labour pass a single vote, except votes of confidence. 

The only way out of the trap is cross party consensus. Either;

* Opposition parties start helping to pass Labour policy
* Labour vote against themselves in a vote of no confidence, then either vote confidence in some opposition arrangement or nobody wins confidence and it triggers an election
* 66% of all MPs (not just those present) vote to hold another election outside of the fixed 5 year cycle.

Obviously the SNP aren't raving lunatics, they aren't going to hold the entire UK government system in some kind of stasis like that. The ability to do it is where the power sits though, the threat of using that power on specific votes or at well chosen times is what will lead to Labour working with the SNP to make sure it doesn't happen.

The only way the SNP could actually bring down a Labour government is to vote confidence in a Tory one. This would destroy not only their reputation but the kingmaker position they would be enjoying at the time.. so it'll never happen.

It is usually a room within a building (i.e. polling place) or a single room in temporary accommodation, such as a mobile caravan, a tent or even a garage.

I agree it's odd, as you qualify to become a citizen after having lived here for 5 years, but you are still not allowed to vote unless you actually become one (which also costs like £1000 to process in admin fees).

Essentially we have very little to say in the policies that govern us, and equally strange we have a say in what policies govern people in our home countries (despite these not affecting us in any way). I agree it's weird, but I don't believe it is particular to the UK - I think all countries have this set up (ie, you need to be a 'citizen', rather than 'resident' to vote - regardless of where you actually live). Arguably this is quite archaic as people move around a lot more than they used to, and can spend a lifetime living in a country without a citizenship.

Labour have a bad track record on a lot of things, but the Tories are probably worse.

As for overspending, I think (and the Green party position is) that we should be spending more in the short term, that saving the NHS, saving vulnerable people from absolute poverty, and allow the economy room to fully recover is more of a priority than eliminating the deficit (not that the deficit should just be ignored, but in the next few years we need to make sure the NHS and the welfare state doesn't collapse, the deficit can be paid off more slowly). 

Also the Tories have a lot of expensive/uncosted plans of their own - they wan't to increase NHS spending too but they won't way how they could afford to pay for it, Labour have said they want to raise the money from a mansion tax. The Tories have also said they want to raise the threshold for the bottom and higher rate of tax, effectively a tax cut, and that's going to cost the government money too no matter how nice it is for the people receiving the tax cut.

Being British means that whilst you hold your respective identity you are collectively of a ""higher"" identity that is just as briilliant as others. But you may be British if you have lived in this country for several years as an immigrant and have taken a citizenship test and passed then you are just as British as everyone else here. 

Many people here take immense pride in their counties, for instance I love being a Devonian! I enjoy having friendly banter with my Scumerset neighbours and those from Dorshat too. I think this is another aspect of being British, our humour and respect for where people come from helps us with our sense of national community.

To be British I think you should be able to speak fluent English, hold a British passport, understanding and appreciating our rich history and passively uphold our western values. Enjoying the stereotypical things like Tea, football, the Queen and others helps but isn not neccesary.

Being British also comes with the mixed attitude towards Europe. I think most people would consider themselves European but they wouldnt hold the European identity as highly as their British or devolved identies. Britain has many Europhiles but just as many Eurosceptics but also has people who just dont really care. 

Times of unity for us include anniversaries of the Monarch and unfortunately their passings. Days where we commemorate the fallen in various wars. We are cohesive on days like today where we vote! Global events such as the Olympics, Rugby, and football tournaments bring out The English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh in everyone which allows us to jest with one another and bring out the British in everyone.

It's not because I dislike Pellegrini, it's just that the other two are very clearly better managers to me, their gameplan isn't as strict or predictable.

Pep vs Klopp is very subjective I feel, but personally I prefer Klopp's high pressing fast-paced counter-attack football over Pep's heavily possession-oriented football. I also feel like Pep sometimes over-complicate his tactics, sometimes it's just best to field your best XI and go through the routine, some familiarity goes a long way. Klopp also seems like he can get the most out of anyone too, he made a team that made it into the CL finals out of almost nothing, Pep is also good at getting the best out of his players but Klopp can do it to a much greater extend.

To me, it just boils down to Wengers disposition. You never hear him talk about being forced into anything he didn't want to do, whether it's tactically out in the transfer market. He evaluates what he thinks players are worth our what he views the best action to be, and then he sets out to get it done. That mentality is part of why there's so much moaning about missed moves for the Arsenal squad. He doesn't really get sucked into bidding wars. He offers what he thinks is fair and if he gets outbid, he find another ""class"" player to go after that he can get for cheaper.

EDIT: Another issue altogether, but I'm also not sure I could see Wenger overpaying for Cech when that means putting more money into Mourinho's coffers. Stingy as Wenger is normally, I think that might make him even worse with the purse strings.

I guess I just always interpret ""breaking the bank"" to suggest essentially going hell-bent to get that player you want, even if overpaying.

It seems like we're arguing some semantics here, though, regarding what the term would and wouldn't be. I totally agree that, after the fact, it was quite an overpay, considering what needs they could've addressed with that kind of cash. But with Özil's age at the time and the things he's already accomplished, I don't think I could've called it an overpay when it happened.

Sure and I don't disagree that a lot of these criticisms are very good and fair. 

What strikes me is that I don't see a lot of this legitimate criticism being aimed at the Labour party. it seems every verbose riposte and coherent argument on this subreddit is directed at the Conservative party whilst Labour get a free pass. 

I suppose this will happen because Conservatives are the party in power and so there is more to criticise as they are the party actively sculpting government policy, however the feeling I get from /r/UnitedKingdom is that people are so fixated on hating the Conservatives that Labour are just getting an easy ride.

Labour are far from perfect and there are some really legitimate criticisms that just don't ever seem to get aired.

Whilst nurturing and developing talent is great, you will lose your best players if they feel they can't succeed. That's just market economics, as a club we cannot lose sight of the wider market. We are too often keen to save on wages whilst overspending on transfer fees, it's a shortsighted strategy when you consider our net spend over the past ten years.

Also if you believe that Balotelli was a statement signing, I don't think you understand what the term actually means. We went for Balotelli after Sanchez rejected us, Remy failed a medical and Rodgers himself come out and say he didn't want the player....hardly a transfer coup.... or a statement of intent.

As I said, if we are to target the title and want to achieve real success (not just top 4 in the league), you have to build an identity and a blueprint for your style (we do have this under Rodgers) but equally important is knowing when you have to roll the dice.

null,false,2ToTooTwoFish,BnW,,null,"Pep over Klopp, but I'd like Pellers to stay one more season. People say Pep likes to overcomplicate things, but I don't think he does unless there are injuries. He regularly plays with his best 11, I don't think that the main players changed very much when he was in charge of Barcelona. The end of this year, he's forced to try different things to combat injuries and he is known to be very experimental with his tactics, but I'd love to see him manage us. 

Klopp's style is too physically demanding, I feel, and will lead to injuries for a lot of players which I would hate. 

But onto my main point. 

Both of them are managers that will impose their style and not compromise it even against tougher opposition (much like Pellegrini actually which is why I wouldn't mind if he stayed with us) and I think that that mindset is ideal for a team that wants to be a total dominating force. Chelsea will never be a force like Barca with a pragmatic manager like Mourinho in charge. I don't want to be like Chelsea. People like a bit of pragmatism, but I want us to be so good that pragmatism isn't needed. It must be because I saw MSN last night, but damn, I really want us to be able to play like that. Of course, it's a far long way away and probably won't ever happen, but a man can dream.

Pep edges it because of the attraction to transfer prospects. 

TLDR I don't mind Pellegrini, Pep, or Klopp. They are all managers who wish to impose a style of play that doesn't need to be compromised to win the tough games. It may take a long while to achieve this, but I believe all three are capable. Pep would be my first choice because we can attract great players.

The real question is how long did you have this job?

Where did I say anything of the contrary? Can you read?

Cherry picking De Bruyne and Griezmann, who were 2 of the best transfers any club made in the last window and comparing it to 1 transfer who, through injuries, has been a let down. Such a weak argument. 

You think Atletico Madrid don't make mistakes? Ever seen Alessio Cerci play for them? Probably not as they spend around £14m last season for him then sent him on an 18 month loan after 6 games. He's a striker who's scored 0 goals this season. Athletico And Wolfsburg are on around the same level as us, they've made good and bad transfers - just like us.

The BEST young talent usually goes to the clubs with the most money, that's just a fact. Yes occasionally very good young players go to tier 2 clubs, when the tier 1 clubs pass on them which is what happened with De Bruyne and Griezmann. That doesn't happen often and with most of these players we've ""missed out on"" or ""have handled the transfer badly"", it's just a case of not being physically able to compete with finances.

Nope

Scottish if pushed, but I would rather simply stick with European - I don't like the idea of nations

&gt;What does it mean to be british to you?

To me nothing, but as a literal definition I think it means being familiar and used to British customs and things, and primarily identifying with them. You don't have to have a British passport for this, and not having one doesn't mean you aren't.

&gt;During which circumstances do you most strongly sense national unity or cohesiveness?

During the referendum campaign, and more recently when seeing Scotland attacked in British media and because of the lack of any meaningful new powers. Never at times when you're supposed to feel British

US progressives want compulsory voting because there's more registered Democrats than Republicans and has been for years, if not decades, but registered Dems are much less likely to actually go out and vote.

If you vote SNP, Labour or Conservative your chosen party is set to get way more seats than it's entitled to. The SNP are predicted to get 8% of seats with only 4% of the vote. If you vote for any other party, they will hardly get any MPs. In 2010, The Lib Dems got 23% of the vote but 8.7% of seats. Even more weirdly, in 2005 they had less votes (22%) but more seats (9.5%).

If you're in a safe seat, your vote doesn't count no matter who you vote for.

If you're in a marginal seat, your vote only counts if you choose one of the top 2(or maybe 3) in that seat. In practice this means the parties' manifestos and policies are crafted to appeal to voters in the marginals - the population of the marginal seats effectively dictate what happens in the whole country.

Say you want to grow a smaller party some day - under the current system that's almost impossible as if you vote for the smaller party, the big party you prefer has lost a vote and the big party you hate the most is more likely to get in.

Regardless of opinions toward the Greens, getting 5% of the national vote but (predicted) only 0.15% of seats makes no sense.

To me, being British is something you can do if you prescribe to British values. This doesn't mean not having your own religion or your own culture, but by being open to the other cultures of the UK. For example, I think a curry can be a very British thing, that doesn't mean that it's not Indian or Pakistani or Bangladeshi, but that it is British too. Just like I believe that haggis is British and Scottish. Just like tea is British and Chinese/Indian. I think being British is a celebration of the cultures of these Islands, and I'm happy for more cultures to be represented.

Edit: A good example of this was Syria. Should Ed have really sat back and gone ""Hey guys our party did lead the country into the war in Iraq, perhaps we shouldn't challenge them on this""? Absolutely **not** he admitted that the previous labour government was wrong (as did Prescott) and lead the opposition into stopping us making a huge mistake!

Though the 5% top rate tax cut sounds like a bad thing in principle (how dare those elitisit millionaires benefit is the general sentiment expressed here) it actually has lead to more revenue for the government which can then be spent on areas like welfare, the NHS, education etc.  

&gt; Also, considering I earn a comfortable wage, well above the living wage, I feel dirty getting a tax cut, knowing that the reduced tax revenue means cuts to welfare.

I admire your philanthropic nature but you shouldn't feel bad about having more money in your bank account. 

Personally I agree that the Conservatives have been a little too ruthless with Welfare and would like to see them reform their reforms (!) so that those who are worse off are not struggling so much. 

Though I'm more concerned about Labour pumping money into welfare beyond reason and making working people and families pay higher taxes and receive less income without justification.  

I think the Labour government went too far in the other direction and bloated the welfare state to a point where middle-income families suffered.

It doesn't give us anything new, but mostly repeats and reinforces what ordinary people think; the people who lack all the adequate information. 

I'm not saying this makes these opinions invalid, I just don't agree with the starting point since I'd prefer a more centrist approach. There are ways to get the balance between making information accessible and retaining people's attention without *over* simplifying into what I see as false, overly-moralised dichotomies. 

&gt; You're essentially making the argument that the one pledge they made to the PEOPLE is worth reneging on because Labour are further away ideologically on economic policy. 

Not at all, I simply think it had to be done. Making it into the typical leftist Kantian/deontological attitude (i.e. one must *never* under *any* circumstances break a promise) is simply not useful (in my view). Perhaps I am more utilitarian or Aristotlean in my moral philosophy.  

While I accept that *politically* this looks very bad, I think that *pragmatically* it had to be done. At the rate we're going tuition fees were inevitable and the clear tradeoff made, which the Lib Dems under Clegg found stomach-able given their economic/moral disposition, was simply to get other reforms through and sustain or increase funding in other areas. 

They made the pledge prematurely before being able to look at the all the books. I didn't expect a minor coalition partner to fulfil everything it pledges, much less such grandiose pledges (which they shouldn't have made; I accept this, they got it wrong. They apologised. It will take some time for people to move on but eventually they will) but particularly not in the face of stark opposition from a larger party with more support, so I wasn't as phased by the result.

&gt; economic concern was top dog as usual.

Economic and moral concerns are one and the same. This is my view at any rate. 

&gt; of a Tory dominated media.

The Tories may have a strong footing in the conventional press (though they are not the only ones), but the internet is similarly disproportionately lefty. I'd call it a level playing field. A few with a lot of money, or many, many more with votes/voices. It's roughly equal. 

&gt;Lib Dem policy successes as rolling over and lying down for Cameron.

I agree. It's a shame this overshadows their other achievements and important differences between them and the Tories. But it's understandable given the current political climate, focused on populists (SNP/Greens/Ukip) vs 'establishment' (Lib/Lab/Con).

&gt; They do in theory yes, but I think mainstream political opinion vastly underestimates the influence of the media on how and what we learn. Government has a duty to promote a society where these values are instilled in us from a young age

I agree with the first part, but would only tentatively agree with the second. I don't think the duty (here we are speaking like Kantians again) is solely on the Government, because this creates a conflict. I'm not comfortable with the notion that our political/democratic values should come mostly from the Government. I think there are other groups in society where these can (and should) come from. Not just groups, but also individuals citizens. 

&gt; if you still think that the cuts made the stimulus possible..

Let's put it this way. We had a largely economically liberal Government. Their focus will be on improving welfare through the private sector by keeping a close eye on public finances. Had they not made *some* cuts (at least) the effect would have been for sure a ""double stimulus"" and therefore for sure a ""double"" deficit *in the short term*. 

Economic liberals are not this Kenynesian. They simply did the reverse. Sacrificing short term growth for long term growth and a smaller risk of exposure to the bond markets *in the long term* because you can't just keep on spending indefinitely, kicking the can down the road. This leaves you enormously exposed to future fluctuations or future economic crisis that may be out of your control.  

The argument that this was done to cut the deficit is only half true. It's false for the reasons you say (i.e. it hasn't). But it's true in the longer run (unless other variables come in to play, which they very well might; the world is uncertain). 

&gt; Could you elaborate a little? Obviously I'm not saying there is no morality in politics, the point I was trying to make is that I feel legislature is too focused on economic gain and not enough on moral principles, and that there are certain individuals who take immoral advantage of their influence.

I think the economic and the moral are very closely intertwined, so am not sure how sustainable a distinction between a focus on 'economic gain' at the expense of 'moral principles' really is. I suppose what you're saying is the focus appears to be on finance and not so much on humans/well-being. I can understand this given that money/wealth doesn't necessarily make people 'good.' 

But let's turn the argument on its head. Suppose the focus was purely (or mostly) on 'the good' in the sense you appear to mean (i.e. humanitarian sense). A lot of people might be better off if their mortgages were forgiven. How long do you think a system where we could just write off debts, e.g., almost at will, last? I think this would make people more immoral through the over-benevolence of such a system. It would kill through kindness. 

Speaking as a lawyer, you would be amazed at how many people try to take advantage of any system put in place. If it's too forgiving as a system, or too 'good' you will slip and slide into being in the same position as if it were too hardline. There will always be people who seek to take advantage of the system or their own position; there is only so much that can realistically be done about this. 

&gt; But to me that sense of morality would at least have the end of greater compassion, equality, and unity, so the ends justify the means.

There is no guarantee you would get that end of 'more goodness' in the world. But one can hope, I suppose. I worry about the premise that in order for such 'goods' to be achievable, the state needs to play a greater role. But I'm a liberal after all. 

Interestingly, classical liberalism (now associated somewhat with the right wing, at least economically speaking) was the original 'left.' 150 years ago, classical liberals argued in favour of globalisation and world trade as a means to end the tyranny of the overly centralised State (i.e. sovereign kings/aristocracy; now the 'political elite' in todays's terms.) But they got complacent as things were moving in this direction (liberalised trade, less barriers to the movement of people) and now the 'new left' is more concerned about using the State to steer society towards 'goodness.' 

&gt; (surely you can't deny that in the last 50 years, labour and conservatives have bunched up tighter)

Well it's only under Blair that they became that centrist. There are still significant differences between Labour and the Conservative; just look at where their funding comes from, that's usually a strong indicator. 

I would deny that they are the same, but can accept that they compete for votes at the centre ground (most people aren't extreme, after all). Yet what is the causal relationship here in terms of the centre ground? Is it because voters congregate at the moderate centre, or is it because politicians 'tell' them too? What came first, the chicken or the egg?

If the (not completely) false dichotomies galvanise people to be active participators in democracy, is that such a bad thing?

Not necessarily, but very possibly. It's a slippery slope. It depends what the quality of the information they are being galvanised under is. And it depends on the cause they are being galvanised for. It also depends on the results of this 'galvanisation.' It is serves to further blind us through sheer emotion/morality/passion and obscures other elements of the truth (like Russell Brand's heavily biased and exaggerated claims tend to be, for instance), then I think it has the potential to be a very negative thing indeed.

null,false,apinkknee,null,null,null,"Well, I'll give some abbreviated thoughts because I'm a tad busy with actual work haha. 

I don't think our defence, as /u/anykazam suggests, has been *that bad* this year when you consider that we brought in Dier, Fazio, Stambouli and Davies. Note that Walker spent the first 7 (8?) weeks out, and Vertonghen was being utilized at both CB(R), CB(L) and LB. We haven't had the consistency or understanding from these guys. I won't go into how Poch's system actually affects the back-lines decision making, because that's a whole other thread. When you watch us concede goals because of back-line error, it is almost always a lack of understanding and cohesion between them as a unit. We can easily see it high up the pitch, or just outside our 18 yard box. Sometimes they are individual errors, but the majority a unit failure. Look at Ageuro's goal, Siggy's goal earlier this year, and the last Leicester goal from late March. 

Siggy's goal is a breakdown of communicating roaming players. Some blame comes from Bentaleb who tracked zonally instead of by the man, but Rose should have been screaming at Jan that a man was coming into his space, assuming the call was to mark zonally. Alternatively, Rose roaming with the player and screaming at Bentaleb to track Siggy. 
Aguero's goal... obvious. Mason is not a CB and had no awareness for the off-side trap.     
Leicester's last goal was actually well done in terms of whoever it was powering through, but a cohesive unit would have make that look simple. I don't even recall who was playing that game, but the RB came across to challenge, dropped off and left our CB(R) to make a late momentum-less challenge that was thwarted. The RB (Chiriches?) then looped around but by that time it was much too late. Simply put, what was expected to happen with that goal probably wasn't established. Neither knew who was really responsible for that gap in space. 

One of the biggest things I try to teach youth full-backs is that when teams push to the corners, you are seeing the whole pitch horizontally. Especially at the youth level, the leadership role is given to the CB; when their back is turned to 80% of the pitch because a player is bombing the flank, they're very unlikely to pick their head up and look around for a second. The full-backs need to know and start honking about impending danger. Obviously, top level professional are much better all around and Walker stands out to me as someone who you see shouting. Rose, not so much, but whatever. 

I can't place blame on the mass of our back-line; our midfield pairing is not amazing to compliment an above-average back-line. In sides where the CB pairings are big, fast and one is naturally a ball playing defender, you can get away with two box to box midfielders, but we don't have that luxury. Having a player a la Schniderlein (sp) who wants to naturally sit deep and place a barrier between a striker/AMC and our two CBs would go a long way to ensuring we have a back-line that is a cohesive unit. 

blah blah blah, I can talk more, specifically about how I would fit our backline together with a holding mid, but that requires pictures and schematics and more time than I have right now. I also teach this stuff to 12-18 year olds and it's so much harder with them, they think everything is FIFA.

intresting Council Tax fact - if you live in a bungalow theres a good chance you will pay more as a result as the tax is partly based on the surface area of your ground floor. Makes no difference how many live there, or how much land you have.

I am also sceptical as to whether that will actually happen. It will split the Conservatives into 2 camps, any token renegotiation will not work and the process of leaving the EU will consume the rest of the parliamentary term and cause the Tories to lose the next election for sure.

Where I live at least, it is a Conservative safe seat with the only challenger being UKIP so whichever way I vote there isn't a risk of voting in a candidate who doesn't want a referendum.

in what sense?

Also, I forgot at the time, but the increase of the personal allowance was a lib dem manifesto promise, so the cons probably can't take all the credit on that one.

&gt;I admire your philanthropic nature but you shouldn't feel bad about having more money in your bank account.

I wouldn't have to feel bad if the allowance went up, AND welfare wasn't cut, but alas, here we are.

&gt;I'm more concerned about Labour pumping money into welfare beyond reason and making working people and families pay higher taxes and receive less income without justification.

Their manifesto doesn't suggest any of that, by my reading. They plan to increase the top rate back to what it was before, and to introduce a tax on properties worth over 2 mil. I don't see how that takes anything from 'working families' with the implication being that you mean working class, or non-rich, presumably. I have to admit, they haven't been clear about how exactly their starting tax rate would work, but as long as they don't cut the personal allowance, it will be a unequivocal tax cut.

Worth pointing out that the tax policies of Gordon Brown a decade ago are not longer at issue, not voting labour in 2015 because you didn't like how brown handled taxes, would be no different to not voting conservative now, because you didn't like how maggie treated the miners.

&gt;there is a shortage of nurses in this country at the moment, leading to the NHS considering banning all private contracts in order to force more nurses back into employment. Perfect time to cut off or get rid of all the foreign nurses and watch NHS spending soar!

You have been severely misinformed on UKIPs policies.

Let me cover your first point. Students would be free to come to study in this country as they do now (in the uk) with Student Visas that are also used in many places all over the world. It has nothing to do with immigration i think you are confused.

As for your second point I think you should seriously consider reading up on UKIP before you post any more because i have no idea where you are getting your information from or indeed if you have made it all up yourself.

In the UKIP manifesto

&gt;Fund 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs and 3,000 more midwives

.

&gt; We will spend a total of £12 billion more on the NHS in England by 2020 to make sure it stays that way.

Also the immigration scheme put forward by UKIP does not get rid of anyone from the country i have no idea what you mean by 

&gt;get rid of all the foreign nurses

Under the immigration plan (a points based system similar but not the same as the Australians) you accept people into the country based on the skills and resources needed in the country. This can include nurses and doesn't at all stop foreign workers in the UK it only controls the ones with the skills we need.

What I do disagree with is the implementation – penalties where no smaller houses are available, the rather restrictive guidelines on children sharing rooms, etc.

However, I find the emotional arguments about 'I've lived here for 40 years' rather pointless. It's not their house, it belongs to the state, who has the responsibility of accommodating as many people as possible. It's not even a rare thing for elderly houseowner couples to downsize in retirement, why should those living off the state be exempt in the name of nostalgia?

If the new world does move to what one dominated by liberal international system what part of that system excludes states based on their relative size. The international system does not reject states based on their refusal to take part in a federal union of states. That is ridiculous. Almost every state in the world is getting on fine without going into a political union with its neighbours. 

Are all of these countries going to become obsolete wastelands? No. Are all emerging economies going to suddenly fail because they didn't form a political union with their neighbours? No. Are modern economies outside of Europe going to become worthless? No.

With the talk of empire, the EU if anything is the answer to that, lets take our waning relevance and combine so we can once again project European power.

If you're a unionist or soft unionist but want a less agressively British identity, Alliance seems the way to go, but don't vote for them for being progressive, a bunch of them have voted no or abstained from the gay marriage vote.

If you don't care about the border/identity or realise that the GE isn't a referendum, SDLP are fairly progressive (though a few of them abstained aswell during the gay marriage vote).

Immigrants are also likely to be far more mobile so that would probably go against letting them vote. If a government that you don't like does something you hate, let's say it doubles tax, you're far more likely to leave than a British person who has lived here their whole life. So in that case you might get a load of immigrant voters voting for short-termism politics that the rest of the country, and therefore the government, may be sceptical in allowing and then not want to extend the vote. 

If you've lived here long enough to become a citizen and you want to vote then become a citizen. I don't think that that is completely unreasonable.

null,false,TomShoe,1972crest,,null,"It's a complicated relationship to be honest. Morally, I'm really not a fan of the UAE at all, not so much due to human rights violations (which, although very concerning, can't be on any greater scale than you'd find in America for instance), and more because the entire social system is based on grotesque inequality — in which race plays a disturbing role — and wage slavery. The most serious abuses are committed not by the government (though I don't doubt they have shady dealings as well) but by the multinational corporations and individual plutocrats who more or less control the place, and who's activities the government is at the very least complicit in, and in some cases a party to.

So no, I don't support the regime in UAE or Abu Dhabi, and if there were to be an Arab-spring style revolution, I'd probably view it as a pretty good thing. 

(This isn't the place to go into geopolitics, but the fact that immigrants from south and east Asia make up so much of the lower class population, and that most of the qualms they'd have with the government would be socioeconomic rather than religious or cultural, and finally the shear amount of money changing hands in the Emirates would mean that you'd be unlikely to see salafist extremism fill the void)

So on one hand, it'd be nice to be able to just say that I ""just sort of put up with it because it's my club and I'll love it no matter what,"" and it *is* true that it's my club and I'll love it no matter what, even if there's a revolution in Abu Dhabi and without funding, the club collapses to the point of making Leeds look like a well run enterprise. 

But at the same time, I'm hardly ""just putting up with it."" I can't pretend I don't revel in the fact that the club I started supporting when they were midtable just to be different from all the United fans I knew is now regularly making United it's bitch. The success Mansour has brought this club is truly immense and it's really unlikely we'd ever have gotten to this point on our own, especially now FFP's in place. Hell, Mansour could have come along even one year later, and this probably wouldn't have been possible. 

Now personally, I think City's got a great history, a truly unique and fervent core support, and a great narrative as the new-money underdogs on the world stage for the first time. I think the club was fully *deserving* of this opportunity, and at the end of the day why should the club we all love so much be excluded from the highest level of the game just because it didn't happen to be there before the ladder was kicked away?

So I have no problem taking Mansour's money, because it makes the club better, and I love the club. But I can't pretend I love where the money comes from.

Ultimately, this whole spiel is probably not very enlightening for you, as there's no clear conclusion. I can't reconcile my two disparate feelings on the issue, and remain conflicted over it. But if internal conflict is the price of success for me as a supporter, I can tolerate that. Does that make me an amoral piece of human trash? Maybe, but to be honest, I don't really give a fuck.

I didn't have a single landlord born in the UK (having moved 5 times, that seemed a lot!) and I was concerned about jobs being given to foreigners. With UKIP, I liked, in particular, their stance on immigration.
However, upon getting a job in the private sector, I made a lot of mates from abroad and my stance changed.  Also, I married a woman with foreign heritage and ultimately my mum's side of the family are Scotch Irish by descent so who was I to judge. Basically, I thought I was verging on racist, turned out I wasn't (but I'm still concerned that we have an open door policy for such a small country when France have a much larger land mass and a very similar population number...

I disagree. If you're planning a job as a doctor or lawyer then maybe it doesn't do anything for you, but if you're struggling to get a job because you've been unemployed for two years and employers aren't willing to give you a chance then it does a **huge** amount for you. For example:

* It proves you are willing to work if the opportunity is there

* It proves you can turn up to work on time

* It proves you aren't too proud to do basic stuff while learning the ropes

* It proves you can work well in a team (or at least, tolerably well in a team)

* It proves you'll stick around in a position for more than a couple of weeks at a time, so are worth training

As an employer, I would pick a candidate with one year of a demeaning McJob over a candidate with a one-year gap of employement every time (obviously, excluding stuff like formal education and having children)

The state should not be paying the wages of people working for non-state-owned organisations.

It isn't slavery like whipping a black person and making them pick cotton in the blistering sun, but that doesn't mean it's not a kind of slavery. Being made to do work, and not being paid for **that work**. Benefits are not wages paid in exchange for work, that's not what they are for. If I hadd a slave, and some good Samaritan dropped by and handed them a few coins - that doesn't mean they aren't a slave.

And let's not skip over the fact that if a JSA claimant can work in Tesco, that's a) a job available, and b) squandering the contribution to the economy that person would make if Tesco just employed them, and they then paid income tax. So not only does the scheme give a free worker to the 'employer' at the expense of taxpayers, it also simultaneously damages tax revenues, by undermining them. 

Also, the weekly amount you get on JSA is about enough to pay for maybe 3-6 meals, let alone rent or bills. So.... yeah, not acceptable to be something given in exchange for work.

Some people sometimes point to his (I think) uncle trying to bring a holocaust denial conference to UAE, but then the government (of which Mansour is part) shut it down.  Did he have anything to do with either part of that?  I don't know.  He could be a voice for reform in the UAE, or he could be a traditionalist.

As an aside I *do* know that human rights are less of a concern in UAE than in a number of neighbouring countries.  I don't like the country's official stance on gay rights, nor some if it's policies on women's rights (although women in the UAE apparently have perfectly good access to higher education and can hold office).  The big human rights issues of the day in UAE are in the treatment of Islamic extremists - something I have no leg to stand on over being British and living in the US.

I wouldn't choose to live in the UAE (despite their great policies on education and healthcare), but I respect cultural relativism.  As for Mansour himself, it's difficult to find what (if any) influence he's really had in UAE policy.  Or at least difficult enough that it goes beyond my level of concern.

I wouldn't mind us signing Benteke in principle, but if we're paying anything over £20m I think it'd be a poor signing. 

Lacazette I'd see as a better option if we can get him, though he's  a bit risky given he'll be switching leagues and will probably need at least half a season to adjust. He at least feels more like a player worth taking a gamble on. 

Realistically, we're not going to be spending more than £50-60m net this transfer window, and unless Sterling leaves for big money I don't see us getting much cash from transfers out. If we're going into the market of players worth £20-30m and upwards then we can really only afford to buy two, and given our squad still isn't the best in terms of depth we can't really afford one or both of those signings to be flops either.

Whilst we know for a fact that Rodgers didn't want Balotelli how do we know he wasn't the one who wanted Moreno or Aspas. We don't know who he signed and who he wanted because he hasn't come out and said anything.

You can't just pick and chose who was signed by who when you don't know. Besides the transfer committee has been heavily criticised for signing players Rodgers allegedly didn't want.

The bottom line is preventing the manager from having any control over transfer. Does not work.

You have to include benefits as income because otherwise the figures don't make sense. You'll end up with a net negative for final income for the bottom 10% because their not earning enough of their own income to cover the cost of living. Of course the bottom 10% are better off after benefits, if we wanted to make the top 10% better off with respect to their own income after benefits you'd need to award them:

x is final income, y is benefits:

(x / 104940) = 132.4/100 , 107224 - 2284 + y =  x

y = **£34,000**

The issue the current government has created is with rising VAT and Council tax (which are affecting earners disproportionately). 

For example if we take just indirect taxes (VAT amongst others) and reduced them to 2,275 (for just bottom 10%) then the result of Final Income / Total Income would also be 65.2% and people would be paying the same proportion (100 - 65.2) of their income (inc. benefits) as tax. Fair system.

(Desirable final income: x = (65.2/100) x 9743 = 6352

Indirect tax cost: x = (5132 + 3495) - 6352 = **2,275**)

No because there is no competition to reduce costs. The 3rd party is liable to pay not only your injury costs but also your legal costs. So once you engage someone to act on your behalf they will be adding as many hours as possible onto the bill because if succesful they get it all paid back.

They can charge £500-1000/hour quite easily so it quickly adds up.

What's your point? Jealousy? Some sort of high moral principle? A pound is a pound. Why are people saying the solution is higher taxes? 35% is a shitton of taxes. The 43% should be lowered instead. Don't tell me that's not possible. How much was the cost of the Olympics in London? It was £9.9 billion. It's government waste for vanity. Host cities overall lose out financially.

But my point is not about the Olympics. It's about governments wasting, and pilfering tax money, and stealing from the brainwashed public who think taxes are the solution to their woes.

Look at this:

http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pulls-the-plug-on-its-11bn-it-system-2330906.html

(Read the whole article. They have numerous examples of wastage.)

They spent £11 billion on a healthcare IT system, and then they just pulled the plug. Any moron can see that politicians stole all that money. This is how government fucks people over, and then they place the burden on the so called rich. This is how it's always been. Government play the blame game, and get us enraged by tapping into our envious nature, and then we totally buy into it. We get angry at these richies, and don't

So here's what happens:

The House of Commons votes by simple majority ""This House does not have confidence in Her Majesty's government"". 

The government is dismissed. With no Cabinet to wield powers on her behalf, the Queen holds executive power directly, though the Civil Service will pretty much run itself, holding things over until democratic government is restored. 

(If an emergency occurs requiring executive action, the Queen, acting with her Privy Council (which contains, among other notable people, the leaders of the main political parties) may make an Order in Council, a Royal prerogative with considerable discretion. An Order in Council is primary legislation that only an Act of Parliament can overrule.)

Coalition talks take place between parties. Either:

A) Within 14 days of the vote of no confidence, a party is able to make deals such that it commands the confidence of the Commons. The Queen invites the leader of that party to form a government, and the House of Commons passes a vote of confidence in that government (it's this vote which must take place within 14 days). The last part is crucial, added by the Fixed Term Parliament Act.

B) Within 14 days no government has been formed with the approval of the Commons. Another general election is automatically called.

I agree with you on Lacazette. Although Arsenal has show interest in him, he will have to fight with 2-3 other strikers for a starting role. Players do follow news and he knows we need a consistent striker. If there is one immediately impacting player, he is it.

""Karim Bellarabi would fit the RW position perfectly.""
Also agree. Bellarabi is consistent and explosive, unlike Markovic who has timidity still in him. With Bellarabi on the right, Moreno on the left, A (recovered) Sturridge, or new signing (like Lacazette), Coutinho directly behind we have a pretty formidable attack force.

Defensive-wise, we need a less bulky CB. Personal preference is Mustafi from Valencia who has been phenomenal for them this year. But the true hole does lie where you said, the fullbacks. The three man CB has proven to work, and if we transition in some young fullbacks, then we can switch to 4 at the back. Can on the right isn't terrible, but there are more natural RBs.

&gt;Color Blindness Filter in Photoshop CS4
By ELIZABETH J PYATT on March 17, 2009 4:12 PM | Permalink | Comments (0)
An accessibility tip I learned from the Photo Walk Pro blog is a new proofing tool in Photoshop CS4 which simulates two types of color blindness (or color deficient view).

&gt;How To

&gt;The simple how to is that you:

&gt;1. Open an image in Photoshop CS4.

&gt;2. Go to the View menu then Proof Setup then select one of the two Color Blindness options at the bottom of the menu. See Photo Walk Pro entry for screencaps.

&gt;3. To return to full color, go to View then Proof Colors.

&gt;If successful, the colors of your image will be reduced to just those seen by certain types of color deficient viewers - essentially shades or royal blue and yellow/brown. The two spectra images below are a simple demo.",null,0,null,1431015636,null,0,1431015816,0,cr1iniw,null,t3_355vgg,null,t1_cr1iniw,null,t1_cr1akgn,null,null,null,1432826015,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

Lack of social mobility is not a function of natural law - if that is what you're implying. The point is there are things we can change to make it fairer.

&gt;But out of all the alternatives to working, it seems the most likely to take you out of poverty and the most accessible. Do you think that's an incorrect view?

Well I dunno - perhaps dealing drugs? Sex trafficking? Stealing? Marrying the wealthy? Lottery? It's not really the point.

I don't want this to become an argument of semantics. The overall point is not to suggest a better way than hard work, just that more often than not hard work is not rewarded sufficiently.

Also just because benefits are given to them doesn't suddenly mean that taxes should affect them disproportionately, in your example no one would be better or worse off but it would still be an unfair system. 

If we impose higher taxes on people because their receiving higher benefits payouts that's definitely unfair. You think taxing someone 100% of their benefits would be okay?

The unfairness here is that the UK system is supposed to ensure that people with a lower income pay less of that income in tax than someone with a higher income. (Perhaps that in itself is unfair and people should pay exactly the same or not at all [libertarian position]). 

But that's the way the UK system is set up and because of the rises in certain taxes which are affecting poor people disproportionately you're ending up doing the opposite. Your stats support this. People below 10% are paying more of their income towards taxes than the top 10% and that's not fair (doesn't matter how much their receiving in benefits because that's **supposed** to be disproportionate). 

Taxes are meant to be disproportionate against the rich (as I say perhaps this is unfair) but the system is not working properly.

Ultimately I think you're issue is thinking about benefits as different to income in the first place because it's not different at all and that's okay because it's necessary to ensure people can have a reasonable standard of living. 
If a living wage were to come into effect for instance you would see a drop in the amount of benefits being claimed and a rise in the amount of ""own income"" and still end up with this disproportionate outcome.

Tell us how forcing someone who has lived in a house for 30 or 40 years to move out or they have to pay anything up to £40 a week they do not have simply because the family home they live in where the Children have left has spare bedrooms

Oh shut up. If they are living on their own in a 3 bedroom council house, then they need to get out. There are families which could use those extra two rooms much better than them being on their own for them to dry their clothes in and to do their ironing on, or 'for when they kids stay round'.

Oh boo hoo, they've been there for 20-30 years and settled in. Tell them to get a fucking grip. If they wanted to stay somewhere more permanent, they had 20-30 years to get a place of their own, with or without the help of their now-adult kids, with three bedrooms. Instead they chose to not plan ahead, and instead think that the government will let them sit in a house that's not even theirs, with spare rooms around whilst there are families who are sofa surfing waiting *years* for an available place to live in.

It's pure selfishness on the people who are complaining about it, as is one of the most damn important reasons why Labour simply *must not* be let back in.

The issue is, you have to wonder whether all the good he's done for East Manchester is just part of the PR campaign to make the rest of the world look at Abu Dhabi as a modern western place, when it remains anything but. 

The issue at the heart of this, is that the powers that be in the Emirates want the world to see them as modern and western and cosmopolitan — that's likely *why* City was bought in the first place — but they won't actually commit to *being* any of those things. If their involvement in football with City, helps increase their exposure to western influence, and that helps Abu Dhabi become a more free, fair place, then that would be the best of both worlds, and I feel that as fans we have a responsibility to promote this. 

For instance, if pressure from the international community on Qatar ahead of the world cup forces them to improve workers rights, then social progress can be made. 

Personally, I'm of the opinion that the best way to address these problems is not to oppose the rise of non-western countries (which opposing Arab-owned clubs is basically doing, on a very small scale), but to support their efforts, and encourage them to improve.

The fact that it got press coverage really is a fairly useless metric to judge offensiveness on.

Now, was it offensive - Absolutely.
But theres a great deal of difference between something being offensive, and something being grossly offensive on a criminal scale. This isn't a law designed to criminalise childish offensive jokes and insinuations about a persons sexual proclivities, big and black or otherwise, its designed to criminalise obscenely offensive communications. Offensive jokes on the blogs of suicide/crime victims, stuff like that. Things that legitimately cause gross harm and offence. 

Now, I have no doubt these comments caused the victim to feel offence, but that isn't the test. I feel offence just listening to people like you speak. But it isn't criminal.

As well as this they are trying to go towards 'ever closer union' when clearly there is no appetite for that happening in the UK. If they want to create a federal EU state then that is fine but I don't want the UK to be a part of that against our will.

The Western media has forced the impression that our own values are ultimately superior to backwards ones of the East. And while stoning may be brutal, it certainly is out of place to denounce the entire fundamentals of a culture because another culture doesn't like an aspect of it.

In similar cases all over the Arab world forced veiling was implemented for many years, much to the acceptance of many Arab women, and only disgust of Western feminists. The case was that veiling remains an act of modesty and respect in the Muslim faith and most women actively choose to do it themselves.

Just as I am sure the vast majority of Muslims living in dry countries, at least in the Arab world, don't see the act of being dry as a travesty, rather just a part of life. I live in Canada and go to a university, an institution more or less founded on free thinking, alcohol and substance abuse, and yet have Muslim friends who are quite happy to participate in normal culture here and remain dry.

Yes the punishments are certainly extreme, but that develops out of years of dynastic corruption in the Islamic Caliphate between 750-1600. The only real accusations you can put against the current ruling class is being descendants of a certain people, and being liable to the ideologies of those who raise you, which I'm pretty sure everyone in the world is guilty of. Perhaps if the ignore social pressure too log you could call them naive as well, but I think you need to analyse the wider context before calling out human rights violations, as like others have stated, there are probably more social injustices on a much more discriminatory basis happening in the US for sure and maybe even the UK too.
