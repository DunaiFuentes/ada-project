Who said anything about forcing players to join us? You really keep making up things I haven't really said.

&gt;You know Pedro wants to leave Barca because he doesn't want to sit on the bench.  Why the fuck would he want to come to us then?

Because he has a decent chance at finding a place on the team. And it's obvious why he would choose Man U over us. He has a better chance of playing near every game. That doesn't mean he couldn't crack into our lineup. Because he has the talent to do that. It would just be a lot harder than breaking into Man U's.

&gt;I am sure we never looked at him once.  He wouldn't have fit our transfer policy.  We are buying young players and developing them or buying establish stars for our first team.  Pedro would be neither.  We might be flush with money but it wouldn't make sense to pay the wages of a first teamer like Pedro to sit on the bench when we didn't do that with Luis, or Shurrle or KDB and their wages are considerably less.

I'm sure we looked in on him. Why wouldn't we? I'm sure plenty of teams at least asked about the situation. How is he not an established star? He would give Willian a run for his money. He is an exceptional player. His wages also aren't that high and his transfer fee is really low. He didn't start at Barcelona because they had Neymar and Messi. It's not easy to knock them off. Willian is not at either of their levels. We also sold all those people because they asked to leave. It had nothing to do with us. You buy players you think can help your team. He would help our team. But Man U is a better option for him. I'm sure his agent informed us on that. To think we didn't even look into the situation is silly.

Illaramendi has shown good passing ability (90% completion) and the ability to hit long passes (to the head of a certain Belgium perhaps?). As shown in the other tactical thread, in situations where we're holding our shape in away, that would be useful. 

Not only that, but he's a guy who reads the game well. I can't remember which site, but someone did a profile of him in the summer. It highlighted the fact that he made interceptions at quite a high rate. He'd play a similar style of James McCarthy. Not a destroyer but the ability to shield the back four either way.

null,null,Geisterkrieg,,Labour Member,null,"Why not hear it from the man himself? Here's Corbyn's contribution to a debate on NATO in Parliament in 2013:

&gt;At the end of the second world war there was a triumph and a tragedy. The triumph was the end of the war, the defeat of Nazism, the foundation of the United Nations and the universal declaration of human rights and the UN charter. The tragedy was the descent into the cold war, the foundation of the Warsaw pact and NATO, and the decades-long nuclear arms race with costs borne by both sides and the economic problems that ensued as a result. Then there was the election of Gorbachev as President of the USSR, and his proposals for disarmament. The Reykjavik summit was unfortunately neutralised by Reagan’s proposals, and Gorbachev’s proposals for a common European home and promotion of European security and co-operation were not responded to effectively by the USA or NATO. Gorbachev eventually went and the Warsaw pact collapsed. Surely the 1990s were a time for reassessment and looking at an alternative. Why did NATO continue at that point when its cold war raison d’être had gone?

&gt; The Library briefing contains a helpful statement by J. L. Granatstein, a distinguished research fellow from the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute. In the National Post on 5 March 2013 he wrote:

&gt; “Perhaps it might have been better if NATO had wound itself up at the end of the Cold War. The alliance instead sought for a new role, a new strategic purpose, and it found it outside the boundaries of the alliance.”

&gt; He goes on to mention Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and later the Libyan adventures of NATO.

&gt; I think we should seriously consider the whole purpose of NATO. It was founded as part of the cold war and had a specific area of responsibility—the north Atlantic. It successively increased its operations out of area, and with the Lisbon Treaty (*e: he's presumably talking about the NATO Lisbon Declaration, which references Afghanistan, not the EU Lisbon Treaty*) it does two things. First, it vastly expands its area of operation to include Afghanistan, which by no stretch of the imagination can be anything to do with the north Atlantic, any more than can the seas off Somalia or North Korea, South Korea and south Asia.

&gt; [...]  Of course piracy off the coast of Somalia is not a good thing. Instability in Somalia is very bad, but surely one solves that problem by political support for changes in Somalia—to some extent that is happening and considerable changes are taking place. I sometimes get the feeling that NATO spent the 1990s and early 2000s looking for something to do, and that it was more than pleased to get involved in Afghanistan and present itself as the armed wing of the United Nations. It may be that the UN should have its own force, and that is a matter for consideration and debate. However, when NATO calls itself the arm of the UN, what does that say to countries that are not in or aligned to NATO, or indeed are deeply suspicious of NATO and its activities? Members who talk about NATO as being the effective arm of the UN should think carefully about the implications of what they are saying.

&gt; The costs of NATO membership are considerable—probably far greater than those of membership of the European Union, which seems to excite massive debate on the Government Benches. NATO requires 2% of our gross national product to be spent on defence, and Members complain that other countries do not meet those demands. Presumably, NATO membership requires a level of expenditure that many countries simply cannot afford, yet they are required to make that expenditure and, for the most part, to buy those arms from the United States or approved suppliers that produce NATO-issue equipment. We must think far more seriously about why we are in NATO and what it is achieving.

&gt; Let us consider Afghanistan from 2001 onwards. Yes, 9/11 was a dreadful event and an act of murder against civilians, but was it an appropriate response to invade Afghanistan? Twelve years later, 400 British soldiers, a larger number of American soldiers, and a very much larger number of Afghan civilians, and others, are dead. Drone aircraft are operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there is a real threat to the civil liberties of everyone in the world from Guantanamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and anti-terror legislation. That has not made the world a safer or more secure place.

&gt; [...] The other point I want to raise—this will not be popular with many, if any, Members in the Chamber today—concerns NATO’s preference for being the nuclear umbrella, and the holding and potential use of nuclear weapons. These are the ultimate weapons of mass destruction. There is no “limited use” of nuclear weapons. There is no limited availability of them. You either use them or you do not. If you do, it brings about the death of very large numbers of people, a nuclear winter and the destruction of the lives of millions of people. Those who argue that NATO should hold nuclear weapons must in reality be saying that they would be prepared to use them, with all the consequences that that would bring about.

I would add that /u/aenor's reply is largely incorrect: outside of the so-called ""fellow-travellers"", who had largely died out as a serious political force by the middle of the Cold War, the bulk of the Labour left never supported the Soviet Union. I have not been able to find any evidence that Corbyn was a fellow-traveller -- he hasn't supported the Soviets in Parliament, and there's nothing published under his name that I can dig up suggesting that either.

From at least the 50s onwards, the reason for opposition to NATO within Labour mostly rested on the idea that Britain should not be participating in the Cold War, which many on the left viewed as a struggle between varying forms of antidemocratic politics. The Korean War, for instance, was seen by many in Labour as a struggle between two dictatorial regimes (which indeed it was, irrespective of the two Koreas' later political divergence in the mid-1980s), and Vietnam was rather similar. It doesn't sound like Corbyn is in that camp, though.",null,0,null,1439262302,null,null,1439264985,0,ctyr3fv,null,t3_3gj7rw,null,null,null,t3_3gj7rw,null,null,null,1440406550,null,10,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,10,null

This is a thing I've NEVER heard of. Looking at the Visit Britain site, it looks a little expensive. I'd be wary of which 3G network it connects to. They say ""98% UK coverage"" but... I'd need to see that to believe it. It might be more cost effective to get a free/cheap sim card from a phone shop in the uk and use that, or if you are happy to wing it, there's loads of places around with free wifi you can leach off.

&gt;I noticed that the rail pass is not valid for the London underground, do you perchance know if I can use this from transportation systems through cities?

The pass I linked is only for ""regular"" rail services. Most cities only have one or two major train stations, these would be serviced by trains that you can use with this pass. Larger cities have metro/rapid transit systems (like the London Underground, Tyne and Wear Metro, etc.) which are NOT serviced by the pass. You can buy a London Travelcard (available on the same website) which will sort you out for London and that should see you fine. To be honest, in other cities the same kind of thing is only really of interest to residents or commuters. As a tourist chances are they won't be of much use.

&gt;Would you suggest I use both London and York and bases for visiting other cities?

London is great as a base for the South of the country, unless you are dead keen on seeing the South-West. If you want to spend time in Wales, a night or two in Cardiff is almost certainly your best bet. In the North of England, you want to be looking at York, Durham, Manchester or Newcastle-upon-Tyne (not Newcastle under Lyme, which is a lovely place, but not in the North) depending on what you want to do really. I'd always go for York myself but that's a personal thing. The key thing I'd say that it has going for it for you is that it's on the main train route between London and Edinburgh. Edinburgh is a good hub for Scotland. you might want to visit Glasgow or Loch Ness for example and Edinburgh is a sensible distance from both.

&gt;The information you provided me is very valuable thank you for your assistance.

I do have something to add though, perhaps controversially, but I can't be the only one to cringe at questions like 'do we have any rivals?'  

I support any fan if they make an attempt to be knowledgeable and passionate, and that's what you're doing here, so fair play.  There's tons of wankers online who don't hesitate to call people 'plastic', or a bandwagon fan -- ignore them.  

I just feel, respectfully, that if you really know so little about the Premier League and City that you don't even know about the little rivalry with Manchester United, maybe take things a bit slower.  Don't try and absorb everything at once.  We're talking very basic stuff here.

Just consume as much football as possible.  Watch as many games as you can.  Read English newspapers online like The Guardian, or other reliable websites like BBC and Sky Sports (in other words, avoid trash like the Daily Mail).  Watch the CityTV channel on Youtube.  Enjoy it.  Do this every day.  And don't limit yourself to just City.  Also, if you play video games at all, play FIFA, because it really is a fantastic way to become familiar with players and teams not only in the Premier League, but all around Europe.  It's also fun.  

We all started somewhere, it's fine to not know everything.  I remember when I first got into football.  Hint:  I was an idiot (still am, really).

The problem with this is that it relies on people voting or doing something previously. They'll need to get large bodies of people out onto the ground to reach them somehow and persuade them to vote, and in many areas of England (where they'll need to win the majority of their seats to compensate for the ones they've lost to the SNP) Labour don't have a strong local party to do that. 

The reason they were so successful during the 97 election is because they were able to grab the swing voters, but those people have turned their back on Labour and current polling shows Corbyn is going to alienate them further. 

This is just my opinion based on the data what's outs there and knowledge of local campaigning.

But him not even being on the bench against Swansea is a troubling sign, he probably did not impress Jose at all in preseason, to where Moses got picked over him.

Cuadrado's mentality doesn't seem to be that great either. He seems to me like a kid who made that jump up to a new school, and is getting bullied, and he just pouts instead of doing something about it. He's never seemed to be settled here, his confidence is so unbelievably low right now, and I don't think he wants to bother to try and fight for his place either. In fact, more and more I think the rumors about Cuadrado going back to Serie A were started by his agent. 

I actually think now that Cuadrado IS going to get loaned out/eventually sold, and we'll look to bring in a new attacker before the end of the window. Maybe Callejon?

Absolutely everything is emulated, reversed-engineered and blatantly copied.

In Chinese universities, it appears that there isn't even a concept of plagiarism, although the hanzi is 代写. A Chinese teacher I was working with once showed me her thesis. In this final piece, there wasn't one citation or reference, not even a bibliography. I had to go through with her how it would be done in Western colleges. She had no idea and yet, there she was, actually teaching (so she said) Critical-thinking subjects.

In my experience, if I present a test with an essay question from an article, ALL students would copy random pieces from the article word-for-word, regardless of language or ability and without any consequential meaning whatsoever.

I have seen many of my foreign colleagues returning from their lessons completely exasperated because they gave assignments where their students completely ripped-off stuff online. 

Last year, I was asked to teach Critical-thinking as a subject to college students, which I was very excited about.

This subject is taught in UK schools as a major principal for higher education and many UK colleges dependent on candidates who show high performance in such a skill.

However, I had to teach classes of 100+ students- the majority of which couldn't even speak English, which made teaching the core principals absolutely impossible. I was defeated before I had even begun.

This college in Henan boasts an association with Plymouth University in the UK, where a few- and I mean just ""a few""- students are successful in the exchange program.

That's not what I said at all. I was looking at some of the reasons why people in worse situations might be more likely to commit certain crimes. With less to lose the incentives not to commit crime are less and so it's no surprise more crime happens in poorer areas.

Plus, giving the pretty much worthless islands would probably collpase Argentina's corrupt goverment (this one, at any rate) because they lose their patriotic punching bag and people realize ""Uh, hold on, things are still terrible""

As for soldiers, its a bit of a self-decided issue. How many places have brave soldiers fought that we haven't then decided are our to keep forever and ever because the people want to remain Brits? The only one I can think of is Gibraltar, among many campaigns that the UK has carried out.

Ultimately, theres no reason other then political pride and nationalism and, yes, colonialism to hold on to Falklands, and while we do so we just allow the Argentiniats a easy distraction from their own issues and problems.

Give it back, and at best, we might be able to buy it back in 5-10 years when theres been extreme turmoil and the goverments have shifted in Argentina, at worst we've lost some penguins and upset &lt;3,000 people.

the act of detaining.

&gt;not to the islanders who've made it their home

I feel I was pretty clear, they're welcome to stay on the isle if they so desire, or they're free to get an assisted move away from the isles. The fact that the UK is ceding the territory to Argentina has nothing to do with their homes unless Argentina horrifically mismanages it, which is their issue, not ours.

&gt;self-determination

True enough, atleast as to the part that the people have the right to self determine. This would be relevant if the Falklands was a independent or even commonwealth nation, but as its a dependent territory, theres really nothing stopping us. Again, we're discussing the parcelling of land here, not citizens.

&gt;The Islanders want to be British, and that's how they'll remain until they decide otherwise. What a dumbfuck post you just made. 

They're welcome to be British, even entitled to be so. What they are not entitled to is to live on British soil, which is what would happen if they refused to move off the island as clarified above

To help maintain their upward success 

I think he's a player with unique dimensions that aren't the strengths of anyone besides maybe Oscar? His outside game is good. I'd say he has similar traits of our number 8 without the flash, which I like personally but realize that Oscar can pull of some crazy shit. 

Compared to Salah, if we were to pull a matic if thorgan develops into a player we need, he knows how to posses the ball under strong physical pressure. As opposed to other leagues where defense is built to accommodate more time with the ball at attacker's feet and/or give them room to run. 

Could thorgan not improve enough to force our staff to consider bringing him back? Of course he's not ready right now, and you can never tell how a player is going to improve. But he has a lot of good traits and I think of the foundation is there for him to be a player that Chelsea could utilize well. I think that putting him on the same team as his brother means that he would have an easier time transitioning into the league and other people wavefront in before. 

And honestly I was hoping during the off-season that Cuadrado could work on his possession on the ball so he could utilize the traits that made him a player we ended up signing out right. But I haven't seen it yet, at this point I don't know if we will ever see him have true success in the Premier league.

If you asked me who the real rotational player in the attacking midfield should be my answer would be Victor Moses. And with the pedigree he came in with that's a shocking disappointment for Cuadrado. 

I think that it's beneficial that thorgan is over in gladbach, but if you asked me to pick between him and Cuadrado right now, I would pick thorgan. 

Post script go gladbach. Looking forward to a good season from my favorite Bundesliga team. Hope Thorgan can help them improve in the league and make a run in the champions league.

Most of it is common sense; if you are not used to it though, be aware of the security check. To make that easier:

a) remove ALL metal (change, belts as well as obvious stuff like keys) from your person before going through the detector.

b) the limit for liquids is really low, I think it's 150 ml. Liquids includes gels like toothpaste. Put all of that in the checked baggage.

Online checking has made things really much easier.

In the airport, don't be afraid to ASK staff where stuff is.

Basically, you follow signs to check-in (even if you have checked in) to drop your bags (if you have any that are not hand luggage). You follow signs to departures to go 'air-side' which involves passing through passport and security. You have shopping and eating options airside while you wait. You find the departure gate,which has seats to wait, and when they are ready to board they call you. Have your passport and boarding card (you probably printed the card out online these days,or it's even on your phone) ready at all stages of the checking process.

In return of that, Utd will have a lot of fun going down our flanks. Amavi will likely leave himself exposed and struggle to get back in time, whereas Bacuna will be in Young's pocket all game.

He needs some more direction. He has the technical and physical skills, just needs to be given the right guidance. He hasn't kicked on like he should've, but he has the ability. Would like to see him tried more on the left. He offers a very direct threat, which most of our players don't. This season he'll be a decent impact sub at worst.

null,null,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,null,"&gt;Whether it is our network of tax havens that allows the theft of billions from countries in Africa each year, the costs we save by recruiting health workers from the world’s poorest countries, the aid we give as loans which contribute to the looming debt crisis, or our carbon emissions which force African countries to pay out billions to adapt to the climate change we cause, it is the UK and our wealthy allies, not African migrants, doing the marauding.

I do sympathise, but what can, honestly, be done about this? We can't cordon off Africa from global markets without doing substantially more harm than good, and mandating something silly like health workers trained in the developing world being obliged to live there for the rest of their lives would be denying them individual agency. 

Debt reduction/writeoff efforts like we saw at the 2005 G8 Summit are a start, but the West can only do so much- at this point, large amounts of Africa's problems are self-made. 

It's not as though Sub-Saharan African countries are doomed to fail- compare how relatively well-run countries like Botswana have been doing with how places like Zimbabwe have done. Good, stable, reasonably benign/uncorrupt government goes a long way towards pulling a country back from the brink, where the opposite pushes it over. 

The state of *North* Africa, of course, is substantially more our fault right now - I suspect that were it not for what we sparked in Iraq through our inability to control the aftermath of what we'd done to the country, the place wouldn't have turned into a decade-long incubator of terrorist movements exported across the world.

Yes, he misplaced a few passes, but I'd rather he try and fail than hide like some other players were guilty of in the first half.

Another thing. He's 21, and already at his age he's been identified by opposing managers as one of our biggest threats. You can see this any game when he gets on the ball and has 2-3 players hunting him down, and despite this, he still manages to pull out goals like he did on Saturday and bring other players into the game.

Corbyn is not disputing that after 2008 the deficit went up, he is only seeking to highlight the cause of that - the bank bailouts (not excessive welfare spending, for example). The crucial point is that prior to the global economic crash Labour were not spending in an 'unsustainable'  way, but were running, on average, lower deficits (as a proportion of GDP) than the Tories between 1979 - 1997. Since the Tories - or any mainstream party, or really anyone (because regardless of how wrong one might think bailing out the banks were, it was necessary at that point to avert complete calamity) - would have done the same in 2008, they aren't on grounds to pin this on Labour (and, of course, it is not repeated enough, but until 2007 Osborne was saying he would match Labour spending pound for pound).

As for it now being under control, well, that is playing rather fast with the truth (it is perception rather than reality, a perception I presume Corbyn hopes to break through his challenge of the current narrative).

null,null,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"Completely subjective here, but I honestly feel that one of the reasons Corbyn has struck such a chord with the public is not necessarily because he represents a shift to the left, but possibly because he doesn't represent the big backers: lobbyists, media moguls, Big Corp etc. He seems to have the interests of the public at heart while all the anti-Corbyn people in the Labour party appear to be more concerned with businesses and donors.

Campbell of course is far more tied to these backers than most - Cap'n Bob was very good to him after all - and it is still Tony's mates that pay his wages. And while Campbell makes some interesting points it still amounts to little more than an opinion piece.

&gt;I am not talking about safe seats like Islington North, where Corbyn has done a very good job in driving up his majority. I am talking about marginal seats whose defeated candidates contributed to the Fabian Society review of the election, who are pretty clear that Labour did not lose for being ‘not left wing enough,’ but because the leader wasn’t popular or seen as a credible PM, we weren’t trusted on the economy, we were seen as anti-business, and though we were ok at saying what we were against, we did not have the most compelling or convincing vision of what we were for, and how we would make it happen.

And there you have the paradox. Of all four candidates Corbyn is the only one who *has* come up with that vision. The reason pieces like this are a waste of bandwidth is that they amount to little more than ""I don't think Jeremy is the right person because Labour will lose under him."" If Campbell wants someone else to win he has to tell us *why*. He has to tell us what Burnham/Cooper/Kendall actually have to offer rather than speculate Corbyn's potential failure.

Of course, it would help if Burnham/Cooper/Kendall told us what they have to offer rather than Campbell, but that's beside the point. /s",null,0,null,1439282548,null,null,false,0,ctyymx0,null,t3_3gjoc5,null,null,null,t3_3gjoc5,null,null,null,1440410168,null,5,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

But of course there is an issue with saleability. It would be foolish to deny, despite the evident sensibleness of many of Corbyn's policies, that he is to the left of the electorate on many things. The only thing I have to say here is if you don't ask you don't get: the public are not spontaneously going to come round. The point has to be made forcefully, relentlessly.

The thing for me is I think he is the only one giving anything like the narrative I gave above. And by 'only one', I mean he is nearly alone in (mainstream) politics and the media in saying anything like this. This is despite of the fact that, as I think you and I agree, the evidence quite clearly says something like what I wrote above and not the mainstream narrative (Labour overspent, now we need to cut spending). If it is not believed that this is what most people are saying, just look at the conclusions Cruddas drew from his idiotic poll just last week.

So it is not a choice, to my mind, about who will sell this the best. The choice is between Corbyn, who is standing up against the Tory lies on this, and the others, who from 2010 onwards basically swallowed and regurgitated what we know (and they must know) to be a completely false version of recent history. Is it any surprise that the public don't trust Labour on the economy when the other three major candidates have spent five years saying how badly Labour fucked up on the economy?

I hate Blair, and it is unlikely I would have voted for him (should I have been old enough) in any election after 1997, certainly not after the Iraq war, but he and Brown presided over the longest economic boom in post-war history. Nobody says it. They just accept what Osborne says. The other three candidates not only have shit policies, they're a death knell to the Labour Party. They're too weak and pathetic to even challenge the Tories on basic factual matters, let alone the values that should drive the UK.

&gt;As a side point, a new government can never change things very quickly, so the Coalition wasn't really completely responsible for the deficit figures in 2012, and barely responsible for them at all in 2011.

Yes. If that referendum was fair (which is in doubt) then Crimea really should have been handed over to Russia peacefully. Or to answer your implicit question: yes, I do really believe in self-determination.

Quite frankly, I think it is annoying and infantile of you to try and make this about nationalism, and to mock the concept of the islanders standing up for their rights. I am a left winger myself, but I have to say you are one hell of a hand-wringing loonie lefty cunt. I'd be just as against handing the territory over if it was Britain attempting to assert a claim to Normandy (and yes, we have as valid a claim to it as the Argentinians do to the Falklands).

Even if instead of self-determination we went on the international law concept of ""territorial integrity"" (which I assume is what you were getting at, but were too thick to express coherently), the Falklands should still be part of Britain, because it has been British territory since the founding of the UN.

Why the founding of the UN? Well, you have to have some cutoff point, otherwise you would end up having to give Normandy back to Britain, give Finland back to Russia, and give Argentina back to the native South Americans. The founding of the UN was a convenient milestone.

I strongly disagree that creativity can be learned in school or is synonymous with originality.

Truly creative people are those who have practised their skill for many years, having learned and copied what others have done in the past. e.g. Mozart didn't write the 9th symphony the day after he learned to play the piano. It came about after many many years of study and practice, and writing a lot of derivative work.

New knowledge is only possible because of the giants that came before us. Lest we forget, the China we know today is a new country. They've had so much catching up to do after the failure of Cultural Revolution, it's truly amaizing what they've managed to achieve in such a short amount of time. As of 2011 the Chinese have have been publishing around 10% of all scientific papers in the world. Second only to US.

If half of those are plagiarised, or even 75%, you have to admit that it's not bad for a country that didn't publish anything before the 1980s.

_attempt_ to prevent unsafe passing.
The driver can still attempt to pass you unsafely.

[Rule 163](https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/overtaking-162-to-169) is also advisory. The only 'must' in that section applies to overtaking on the left when in a queue.

[Rule 66] (https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82) also states ""never ride more than two abreast, _and ride in single file on narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends_""

Interesting that the clips provided as proof of people not providing enough space when overtaking also show a bike lane that's as wide as a hamster's anus.
I honestly can't see the point of these: They're no use to a cyclist and provide poor visual cues for vehicle drivers because they're far too narrow.
Also: Why are we allowing cars to park in a cycle lane? Either it's a cycle lane or it isn't - let's not be having any of this half and half nonsense.

I take issue with the ""It's not difficult to find footage of X on YouTube"" line of thought. YouTube isn't exactly an unbiased source of footage, and I'm fairly sure you can search and find plenty of cycling that violates the highway code.

Having said that my boss has been knocked off his bike a number of times people overtaking too closely: The last time this happened he was side-swiped by someone's caravan because they clearly had no idea how wide the thing was and no intention of allowing themselves, or him, enough space to pass.

The planned invasion of Iraq was very unpopular, around [a million people](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2765041.stm) marched in the streets against the Iraq war, Blair invaded anyway. 


The reason given for the war was that Saddam Hussein was creating ""Weapons Of Mass Destruction"" (he wasn't and none were found) and that the regime in that country had links to Al Qaeda who were behind 9/11 (they were no such links). This is a complex, controversial issue, but it is hard for anyone to argue that an invasion would have been supported if we knew the truth about the situation in the country.  

Blair (and the US) didn't wait for a mandate from the UN to launch the invasion, and in fact the secretary of the UN [said that the war was illegal](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm).


A lot of people who are politically left wing are still very angry about the fact a Prime Minister from a supposedly left wing party was so keen to launch the invasion, and have grown angrier over time that the war has cost so much in terms of spending (the cost of both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars [is currently around £30bn](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/costly-failures-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-cost-uk-taxpayers-30bn-9442640.html) ) and lives ([179 soldiers have died in Iraq](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10637526)).


There are other reasons for Blair's unpopularity- (he took the Labour party in a very different direction from previous leaders, and some people see that as betraying the roots of the party, some people disagree with the way he has made money after retiring as PM, some people just don't like succesful politicians with different opinions to them).

If the situation doesn't call for drugs then they won't prescribe any. Most pharmacists aren't independent so they don't prescribe, only change doses in agreement with the original prescriber (be it a doctor, dentist optometrist, independent prescribing pharmacist, physiotherapist etc) which would then require a new prescription.

Also the independent prescribers rarely work and diagnose alone unless there is absolutely no choice, they're usually in close contact with other medical professionals related to the care of a patient forming a multidisciplinary team. If it's for something as major as surgery, they won't be making that decision alone. It would be something that a group decides. Denying them access to patient records would affect the effectiveness of the team itself especially in areas where the pharmacist input is ideal (patients with complicated dosage regimens)

Furthermore with the apparent shortage of doctors and long GP waits in some areas. Some local health authorities are commissioning pharmacists for certain specialised services which would normally be performed by doctors such as minor ailments and disease specific medicines management, both of which would likely require access to patient records as well as extra training for the pharmacists to be involved so that they would be suitable to carry out these tasks. 

So basically, you're right. They aren't doctors, they're pharmacists with distinct skill sets that may overlap should further training be undertaken.

null,null,themanifoldcuriosity,null,null,null,"&gt; Wait... I thought we went into Iraq because of WMDs? Because we found none of those. I thought that was the justification?

That was one of several justifications. You clearly aren't aware of the others (though you felt confident enough to talk on this issue anyway), so let me summarise some of the more relevant ones:

- Noncompliance with the conditions of the 1991 ceasefire agreement, including interference with U.N. weapons inspectors.

- Iraq's ""brutal repression of its civilian population"", in which Saddam Hussain engaged in a policy of deliberate genocide against sections of the Iraqi population and is estimated to have caused the deaths of about a million people (not including those casualties of his aggressive wars against Kuwait and Iran).

- Iraq's ""capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people"" - which it definitely did and is the reason allegations of Iraq having wmd were not outright dismissed in the first place.

- Iraq's hostility towards the United States as demonstrated by the 1993 assassination attempt on former President George H. W. Bush and firing on coalition aircraft enforcing the no-fly zones following the 1991 Gulf War.

Thank you for illustrating the difficulties of public relations and the effectiveness of propaganda, though.

&gt; At least Iraq is a bastion of democracy and peace and in no way did the invasion cause misery and death. And at least extremists like the Taliban are no longer roaming...

Yeah, let me stop you there. That's actually an indictment against people like yourself - people who were so incensed by the false evidence of wmd and the perception of a war driven by corporate self interest, that they would willingly declare that it was not worth anything to remove a dictator, or a thuggish theocratic regime who shot girls in the face for attending school. They would demand peace and democracy on one hand and campaign to hamstring the only concerted effort to try and bring it on the other.

You talk sarcastically about how Iraq is a bastion of peace and how the Taliban no longer exist in Afghanistan anymore, but you undoubtedly have supported calls for  coalition forces to remove themselves from those territories (and before that, limitations on funds and resources dedicated to those efforts), which led formerly to the increased difficulty of fighting insurgents and containing the civil war that arose in Iraq post invasion, and has now led unambiguously to ISIS in Iraq and more Taliban operating unfettered elsewhere. But you know, fuck the brown people - Blair lied.

There are relatively few reasons within standard law in the UK that allows the state to compel somebody who is otherwise law abiding to leave private property. (I've a vague feeling that there might be something in some of the nuclear safety legislation, but can't immediately find a reference).

However, the whole concept of private property only exists as the gift of the state under the framework of the legal system. It can be removed if the state decides it needs to. In the utmost circumstances of a Civil Emergency, there are significant powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 for emergency legislation to be made up on the spot by an appropriately authorised person (Prime Minister, Principle Secretaries of State) without approval of parliament. That can certainly include the immediate and mandatory requisition of private property, the enforced relocation of people to specified locations, the prohibition of travel and the creation of offences of resisting such. See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/section/22 if you want to get really paranoid about the (lack of) limits of government power. 

Basically the only things they can't do is violate the Human Rights Act (which mostly allows for temporary derogation in an emergency anyway; only limits are on killing people,  torture, and maintaining rule of law), compel people into military service, or (bizarrely, in my opinion) disrupt industrial action.

Fuck mate... you're lucky you don't support other teams or you'd be having heart attacks every year. 

We waltzed to the title last year, could've lost 4 games in the end, and no English team made it past the Round of 16 in the CL. Only four teams in the history of the Champions League have been eliminated without losing a game. 
The simple fact is that it's not even Week 2 and you're already being pessimistic and berating our lack of signings as if it's a given that we have conceded the title race. None of our rivals signings would make our starting line up and they're the ones that were 13 points or worse behind. If suitable depth replacements for Ramires or Mikel were available I'm sure we would have bought them. As it happened there has been a severe lack of quality players in the market this year and the ones that were out there may not have wanted to warm a bench. If you want to support a club that throws €100 million to get players to leave teams then go support Real Madrid. If you want to get on board with the financially astute model that Chelsea has been building over the last 5 years and concede that us being smart and not buying for the sake of it this window might mean we can land better targets next year then by all means keep an open mind about the season until Week 38.

If any of those players simply give up on their career with us because they aren't first choice then let them leave and leave a sour taste. I've got no time for people like Dan Agger who think they're owed a place when they can't remain consistent in form or fitness.

Moreno seems to have been completely sucked into the Jose Enrique world of not giving a fuck about football and enjoying goofing around on segways on Instagram than knuckling down. He had a poor first season last year and while I think he could end up being a top player, hanging around with Enrique is not going to help your chances of improving either your work ethic or your relationship with the manager who **obviously** feels like Enrique is a bad influence on the team. AND he's been injured during pre-season, how can Rodgers justify putting him in the first team ahead of Gomez who had an excellent pre-season?

Sakho can't stay fit, therefore Rodgers probably doesn't trust him 100%. I don't think it's a particularly mind-boggling opinion for him to have even if Sakho is our best defender (he is in my opinion) - if you're using 1 of your 3 substitutes in a game taking off your CB who's picked up a knock or tweaked a muscle, you've got less options later in the match when you might need to chase a goal or bring an extra defender on, you're giving yourself less options unnecessarily. Sakho's a good professional and I think he'll work hard to prove himself and get his spot back.

Lucas is a similar story to Sakho. The guy has problems staying fit and as brilliant as a defensive midfielder as he is; does he offer more all-round than Henderson, Milner, Allen or Can? Nope. Course he doesn't. I like Lucas a lot, but Rodgers obviously wants to play with a versatile, box-to-box midfield who can defend and attack. Unfortunately Lucas doesn't provide that option.

All of this being said, them not being first choice doesn't mean they want to leave or have to leave. I'll be annoyed if they do go and we don't replace them, as our squad finally looks like it has some strength in depth. 

TL;DR: not being first choice doesn't guarantee anyone leaving. 

TL;DR2: Rodgers can probably justify the decisions quite well, he's not just being an arse for the sake of it like some of you automatically assume.

Clearly not the case with Cecil (though the hunter may have believed he was on such a sanctioned hunt - only he knows whether he truly believed that), but hunting is not in and of itself anti-conservation.

In another five years even more people will be fed up of the cuts and more will be happy to back Corbyn, because he, like the SNP did in Scotland, will offer a true alternative. Corbyn has a clear and direct message, is a man of principles and will be riding the populist line come 2020 with a large political movement behind him. A lot of people, like myself, didn't vote for Miliband because he was bland, lacked a clear message, spent too much time sucking up to the elites rather than sticking it to them and speaking for the people and he didn't come across as a leader of principle. Corbyn has no issue speaking for the people whilst sticking it to the elites, he is a man of principle and lives a modest lifestyle, he has a clear and direct message and promotes peaceful dialogue rather than more war and bloodshed, and he comes across as someone who could be a strong leader rallying the support of the nation to be better and care about other people more, once again putting Britain on the path to being great again and a place where a country cares more about its fellow human than it does about materialism and money. Corbyn and people like him are what will drive Britain towards a better society, whilst also setting an example to the rest of the world that this capitalist myth of the pursuit of happiness is a load of rubbish. In my opinion, Corbyn isn't just a vote for a party, a leader or a prime minister, it is a vote for politically taking humanity in the right direction again after decades of inequality and divisions. Its a vote for direction and its a vote for wanting to be better. Is he perfect? Hell no and the man is modest and humble enough to tell you it yourself. However, he is a man of principle who has his heart in the right place and you can't put a price on that.

And, there will be loads in here saying socialism doesn't work. Neither does capitalism. Capitalism always ends up in its extreme form as corporatism because elite groups always seek to increase their power and control. Earning more money is not the only metric to judge life quality by. What we need is true collectivism whereby people are happy to work for the benefit of all in society, rather than to suit themselves. We improve our lives not by purchasing ourselves nice houses and cars, which are short term superficial pleasure boosts, but by building loving and caring communities, sharing, creating amazing moments and affecting the lives of others in a positive way. We don't need all the money in the world to do that. What we need is education and a sense of perspective. We need to go beyond our selfish desires as human beings and think about the needs of others as much as our own. Only this will improve our lives because under the current system divide and conquer politics is still at play and whilst that is the case sections of humanity will go on despising and hating one another due to nothing more than whipped up media hysteria or anecdotal experiences often exaggerated through the same media (yellow journalism) and we will never move forward. 

People spend time chasing money, buying things they don't need and thinking of only today when in reality that time could be invested to have a much more positive effect on humanity. Be remember for more than what you earned, your job title or the company you worked for. Be remembered for more than the car you drive or the value of your house.

Bath - Historic roman city and world heritage site. Visit the roman baths, circus, crescent and abbey. 

Oxford - Another historic city with the well known University. Visit some of the University colleges, Bodleian library, go punting.

Bournemouth/Poole - Seaside towns with great beaches. Visit Bournemouth town center, Sandbanks beach, Brownsea Island, Corfe Castle (Swanage steam railway).

All are easily accessible by train from London (Paddington station for Oxford and Bath, Waterloo for Bournemouth/Poole).

I've lived in all 3 so I'm biased but I would say these combined with London will give a very good indication of the best of the south. Brighton may also be worth a visit but I've never been there so wouldn't be able to offer any advice on what to do.

Even if we went with a 90% nuclear baseline though, the problem is primarily one of cost.

As I said in the post, we use 30-40GW of electricity per hour in the UK, which means that realistically we would need a solid 30-35GWh of nuclear baseline (which would probably cost £1-200 billion alone), we would also need to build out a lot more pumped storage/hydroelectric power facilities, plus of course a huge increase in Wind/Solar installations too.

The costs involved would be enormous. We'd probably be better off just going pure-nuclear considering we'd already be building another 10-20 stations anyway, and once you factor in the cost of being able to store the Solar/Wind power it would end up costing more than nuclear anyway.

""Otherwise whats identity""

I guess it comes down to how much importance you place on nationalism. I can't really speak on that because I have never understood it. When people say things like ""I'm proud to be British"" I don't understand what that means because it isn't an achievement or something they worked towards, it was simply random chance. It just comes across as a form of tribalism.

In regards to why he plays for an English team, I guess because it isn't really related to any of the entities he has problems with. Occasionally the two overlap but there is nothing you can do about that. I mean I work for an American company but it doesn't mean I have to like the American government or their military.

The joke is prodding at that - i.e. Britain's new found power was as a kind of social arriviste, and was grubbily associated with worldly business (basically, loadsamoney). The quote is attributed to Napoleon, and there's quite a good quote, also attributed to him, denying he said it:

I'm well aware that others were put forward.

&gt;You clearly aren't aware of the others 

I'm sorry, you didn't give any in your first comment. Indeed what you wrote was:

&gt;People in Britain liked Saddam Hussain and the Taliban and thought it was a vile and disgraceful act to take any action to try to remove them.

I'm not entirely sure if you are being sarcastic or not, but I'm not sure how that can be, as you appear to deride the use of sarcasm in your next comment.

&gt;People in Britain liked Saddam Hussain and the Taliban 

This is patently and demonstrably wrong. Those against the invasion were not (in the majority) pro-Saddam. There are plenty of regimes that are awful that exist in the world right now. Should we invade them all? Who are we going to replace their leaders with?

One of the major concerns was that simply bumping off the leadership of a country is not going to magically make that country better, and while the argument was that we would 'install democracy' and 'make the country better', I think a lot of those opposed to the war did not believe it would lead to a positive outcome. 

The argument was not ""yay, Saddam is great! Let's keep him!"" it was ""Yes, Saddam is awful, but isn't this war just going to lead to more misery and how do you think it will 'fix' anything?""

&gt;Noncompliance with the conditions of the 1991 ceasefire agreement, including interference with U.N. weapons inspectors.

Absolutely this was a serious infraction and had to be dealt with. Iran is currently a situation where negotiation and diplomacy is being used as opposed to force. It seems to be working out. Perhaps without the fabricated 'evidence' to invade IMMEDIATELY there might have been a peaceful option.

&gt;Iraq's ""brutal repression of its civilian population"", in which Saddam Hussain engaged in a policy of deliberate genocide against sections of the Iraqi population and is estimated to have caused the deaths of about a million people (not including those casualties of his aggressive wars against Kuwait and Iran).

Absolutely deplorable and indeed he was a brutal, evil man. Those opposing the invasion did not do so because Saddam was a nice guy and indeed he was held accountable for his crimes - which among the negatives of the war is a positive thing. 

Yet there are plenty of awful regimes in the world. North Korea not only has nuclear weapons, but oppresses it's people horribly. When would you like us to invade?

&gt;Iraq's ""capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people"" - which it definitely did and is the reason allegations of Iraq having wmd were not outright dismissed in the first place.

Of course we knew they had chemical weapons at some point - the US sold them to Iraq. The suggestion was that Iraq was willing and capable of using nuclear weapons. It was not capable in any sense of the word. 

&gt;Iraq's hostility towards the United States as demonstrated by the 1993 assassination attempt on former President George H. W. Bush and firing on coalition aircraft enforcing the no-fly zones following the 1991 Gulf War.

This was the reason for the rush to invade? Because the urgency was there due to the fabricated evidence for nuclear weapons. Indeed if there had NOT been such evidence then the invasion would not have been able to happen so quickly. 

&gt;people who were so incensed by the false evidence of wmd and the perception of a war driven by corporate self interest, that they would willingly declare that it was not worth anything to remove a dictator, or a thuggish theocratic regime who shot girls in the face for attending school. 

Can you draw me up a list of the repressive regimes of the world, and a timetable you plan to invade them in?

&gt;you undoubtedly have supported calls for coalition forces to remove themselves from those territories 

lol Have I?

Perhaps I believe that if you break it you buy it. I do believe that you should only go to war if you plan to support injured troops in all their medical needs as long as they are required, but I don't see that happening any time soon.

&gt;You want to talk about the causing of misery and death? Look at yourself and consider what your attitude has wrought.

If every other nation in the world had such decent politicians (across the board), such low levels of corruptions, such freedom of press as we have in the UK, then we could expect regions to deal with their own problems. But they don't and we can't.

The issues our modern leaders deal with are complex beyond belief. There is no clear right or wrong and dire consequences on every major decision. Good decisions can lead to poor outcomes.

null,null,andrewisspecial,null,null,null,"My opinions (not as a labour voter, so far):

A Corbyn victory would swing the Labour Party to the left, obviously, but also the media generated would be detrimental to their central appeal, which is necessary to get any substantial proportion of the voting public. We have already seen Corbyn misquoted in the media regarding renationalising certain industries. The headlines would spiral and he would be compared to socialists by both the UK and foreign media (because that would sell papers).

The Conservatives would likely not engage with the stigmatisation of Corbyn directly as they wouldn't want to be tainted by it. They would play up the cost of renationalising industries and how much it would cost per tax paying capita.

The Conservatives would make associations between the SNP and ""Socialist Labour"" and argue that only a Conservative majority would be able to stop such a ""damaging coalition"". This would provide justification for the non-traditional Conservative voting public (traditional Liberal Democrats and moderately minded Labour voters) to vote Conservative.

As before, the Conservatives would target Liberal Democrat voters. They will be able to appeal to the central voters by providing a some liberal manifesto policies to try to establish the Conservatives in the centre ground.

The Conservatives would then consider their voting demographic and consider how reliant they are on their ageing voter base. They have installed a number of policies unpopular with the under 25s and would like to move away from targeting the elderly for easy votes whilst penalising the young who are the voting future. 

Finally, no one will build more houses. Airport capacity will remain low. Greece debt will either be restructured with a major haircut or the country will default.

The two matches, which kick off at 7.45pm, will open Sky Sports' exclusive live coverage of the 2015/16 Capital One Cup, which will see two fixtures per round screened live on television, including both legs of January's semi-finals, before the final at Wembley on Sunday, February 28, 2016.

""We look forward to many more special moments in the forthcoming season.” 

Portsmouth's match against Derby will be the first cup game for both teams under their new managers.

null,null,lokkenmor,Scotland,Suzuki V-Strom DL650 K7,null,"I'm going to backup /u/DemonEggy's opinion a bit here and say that, while the truck driver was 100% at fault, the rider's decision making was poor.

Notwithstanding this is ""KTM guy"" (whom I've never came across until now) here's my breakdown of the actual ""incident"" portion of the video.

---

Rider is in lane 2 of 2 of a dual carriageway, in a very nearside position, travelling at matching speed with lane one traffic, with clear road ahead.

Now that's an uncomfortable position to be in. For normal driving, I wouldn't keep that position. I'd be in the centre, or slightly off-side. Originally I thought that something might've happened before the video rolls (e.g. the rider had undertaken the recovery truck) but I suppose that would be a semi-reasonable position for someone trying to join lane one. Benefit of the doubt goes to the rider here but I'm not a fan of that positioning at all.

Next, the recovery van comes shooting up the offside, immediately brakes - for no discernible reason - and turns to take up the lanes nearside. Now this could've been to get into lane one, but there aren't any indications to that effect so I'd judge it fair to say that it's been done to block the progress of the bike. The first thought here **should be**, 'Is there any danger behind me?', because other drivers following this clown might not have seen you. Mirror check at the very least to check for dangers to the rear.

Next, thought should be, 'Right, this one's a nutter', because it looks like a pretty clear, deliberate and dangerous manoeuvre to block the riders progress. At that point, there's no reason to believe that this particular nutter is going to suddenly change tune and let you pass safely, or be any less nuts so you have to think about how best to keep yourself safe.

With that realisation in hand, the decision should not be, 'Im'ma go round his other side', because you already know he's willing to use the law of gross tonnage to his advantage, it don't look like he's trying to get into lane one, you know he's dangerously overtaken you unnecessarily and has moved to block your progress.

So rather than immediately going for the over-take, the correct choice is to back off, give this nutter some space and properly assess *all* your options.

Overtaking him right now is just one-upmanship. And it puts you in the wrong frame of mind to keep yourself safe from him. It's target fixation *of the mind*, rather than engaging brain and thinking it through.

Now, at this point in the video everyone's more or less at a stop.

So there's a couple of options here:

1) Wait on him to move off.
-
This is really the best option. Yes, you're letting him control the terms of your road use but you're also not putting yourself in harms way because now he has to do something really stupid and truly unforgivable to cause you an accident (like reverse into you).

Let him move off, keep well back (to account for brake checking). Make sure you can see his mirrors and wait for a safe opportunity to get clear of him, if you can. Or just let him get ahead of you and take it slow.

I suppose there's the chance he might not move off; he could get get out the cab and decide he wants to have a wee chat which could be equally fun but that's unlikely since he, presumably, has places to be and things to do.

2) Go for the overtake (smart edition).
-
If you really want to overtake him then you need to be more careful and check that he'll actually let you (we've established he's nut and he's already purposefully denied you the ability to make progress, no reason to believe he won't do it again).

So, move over to the lane's off-side, sit in his off-side mirror, pause and watch what he does, always remembering that he's a danger to you. Now, if he moves over to block you again you know he's not going to let you through for any reason, so you have to go with option one. Let him get ahead, keep clear, control your anger (because I'd be fucking livid too, I'm not an automaton) and keep yourself safe above all things.

If he doesn't move over, and it starts to look like might be leaving space for you to proceed then it's a judgement call. I'm rarely in that much of a hurry to get anywhere, so I'm probably not going to make use of that space (given the previous dangerous driving) unless I get an unmistakably positive signal from the driver that he's willing to let me pass.

However, for those who are inclined to use space, I'd suggest slowly over-taking, generally past position of the rear axle, and then decisively accelerate past him.

The reason I'd suggest going slowly to start with  is to give yourself stopping time, if he does decide to swing out at you the notion is he'll do it early to block your progress. When that happens the front axle will change position the most, whereas the rear axle will hardly move at all (because it's dragged around by the front steering and this is a long wheelbase vehicle). So, if he does swing out at you (early) then you have enough room and enough time to hit the brakes and stop.

You can see in the video (accounting for delayed reactions and the speed of the attempted overtake) that the driver swung the truck out in an attempt to block the rider's progress (I don't think he was purposefully trying to knock the bike over, because if he'd wanted to do that he could've done it when he passed initially).

The reason to accelerate decisively in the later stage of the overtake is to give him the minimum amount of time to swing late and hit you. This assumes he's actually out to cause injury, rather than merely to stop your progress. Because if he wants to kill you, he'll undoubtedly try it one way or the other. However, there's no reason to make it easy for him.

3) Go for the overtake (brash edition)
-
See the video for how that goes.

Attempting to change the behaviour of tens of millions of motorists by public awareness campaigns is a lost cause. Doing it successfully would cost more and be less effective than building separate cycle infrastructure.

The only way to really make cyclists safe on the road is to move them away from the cars. Road safety needs to built into the design of the roads, this is basic road safety planning theory, to allow for mistakes to be made without people ending up dead. This is also the only way we can get people to take up cycling en masse. We are not going to get a cycling rate of 40% with some adverts and lines painted on the side of the road.

Honestly, I think people are less drawn to his politics, and more to the fact that he seems like the only candidate who is believable. It kinda represents a general trend across Europe: the SNP are polling 62% in Scotland even though only 32% think that the SNP have actually achieved good things for Scotland. In Greece, Syriza are polling 33% (ahead of ND's 17%), leading the polls despite clearly having fucked up Greece quite badly.

Podemos are still polling highly in Spain. The Socialist party in Portugal experienced the same craziness as we currently are (they held their first open primaries and elected someone who was more anti-austerity). The Irish Labour Party are looking likely to be wiped out in the next Irish elections in favour of Sinn Fein.

The thing that ties together all these parties that have fucked up and yet are still polling highly, is that even though people agree they don't know what they are doing, they believe they are genuine and have their heart in the right place.

null,null,edent,null,null,null,"Your main problem here, AIUI, is the source of your deposit.

Most lenders will see it as an unsecured loan.  Unless, of course, your relative is willing to gift you the money.

It might be an idea to get a joint mortgage with your relative.  Get a [tenants in common deed](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/11/how-tenants-in-commmon-work) drawn up that says ""if the property is sold, Uncle Bob gets back £60k and the rest of the proceeds are split 50/50"" (or whatever).

The next problem is how much a bank is willing to lend you.  Even if you found somewhere prepared to lend 4x your future salary, that's ""only"" £200k.  You'll need to have saved at least £50k by then + your relative's loan to cover the deposit plus all the legal fees &amp; stamp duty.

If you're renting out a room, [you can earn £4,250 tax free](https://www.gov.uk/rent-room-in-your-home/the-rent-a-room-scheme) - I think that's total, not per renter.

So, anything you earn above that will be subject to tax.  That doesn't leave you a lot to over-pay the mortgage *and* repay your relative.

Your mortgage provider will want to know about all your sources of income. I don't know whether they'll care that some is from renting a room - but they'll probably insist on a higher rate of insurance.

You don't need to tell a mortgage provider your long term plans.  You *do* need to tell them when you start letting it out full time.  You'll either need consent to let, or a BTL mortgage (plus insurance etc).

In conclusion... It's not *impossible*...  But you need to sort out exactly what strings would be attached to the deposit.  You also need a good idea of exactly how much renting out rooms will bring in.

I never said they can't influence it, just that they don't get to determine it.

If the Labour party moves to the left it will certainly influence public opinion in that direction.

Then why were you talking as if there was only one? When at most that was simply just the latest.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure if you are being sarcastic or not, but I'm not sure how that can be, as you appear to deride the use of sarcasm in your next comment.

Well that's your mistake. It can't be helped if you confuse my deriding of your specific sarcasm with a disdain for the entire concept.

&gt; There are plenty of regimes that are awful that exist in the world right now. Should we invade them all?

That is exactly the same brand of shitty logic that Americans use when they claim that prohibition or control of firearms is unworkable because ""there are too many"". That something is hard to do is not a reason for not doing it.

But this is shitty logic in a way that is pertinent here too. You think that a reason to not invade a country and remove it's despot is because to do so is automatic hypocrisy if you don't do it for everywhere else. In doing so you make the highly erroneous assumption that governments do anything based on purely moral concerns, purely strategic concerns, judgement of cost to reward or in response to looming mortal threats and so on... but never a combination.

So yes actually, it's entirely understandable that these governments would have chosen Iraq and Afghanistan to go for above anyone else. Saudi is just as odious on a moral basis, but you know what they can be dealt with diplomatically in a way the Taliban never could. In the same way, we of course could roll into Uganda or Uzbekistan - but those places have no strategic merit (see also North Korea), nor are their attempts to foment terrorist acts against our country or their neighbors as serious as those prosecuted by the Iraq/Taliban regimes. And how are you going to talk about ""we should remove all dictators if we want to remove one"" when you didn't even want to pay for the one that satisfied as many criteria as that did?

&gt; One of the major concerns was that simply bumping off the leadership of a country is not going to magically make that country better...

Well since no-one involved in pushing the war ever thought that would happen, and almost all the critics of the war did their level best to ensure that no resources were allocated to any effort to effect any strategy comprehensive enough to actually do things right - why would you bring that up?

&gt; lol Have I?

You're not denying it. And the closest you have is a mealy-mouthed and evasive statement that wars are unthinkable unless you ""plan to support the troops"". Not ""if you see evil being done"" or ""if you see a reasonable opportunity to effect change, and have the consensus and support to see it done"". Presumably, this is the same reason you're against the campaign against Germany and it's allies in the early 40s - because I guarantee care of servicemen in that conflict wasn't any better or given any more priority than it is now.

These and many others are more important issues than whether you have a good name or not.

To put these things into context if you went to the opposite end of the scale for set up costs, buy a bucket a sponge and a chamois leather and you have a car cleaning business. If you don't have any customers in any given day with this business it will have cost you nothing.

e.g. shops would have ID card scanners, you'd have to scan each time you buy an age restricted product. Now the NHS can make assumptions if you say you don't smoke or drink but are buying things from the shop. 

Cost was another big one. It was going to cost billions - probably because of all the complexity Labour wanted, and their love of paying useless IT megacorps to spend lots of money and achieve not a lot. When it was clear that the Conservatives were going to scrap it, Labour started signing expensive contracts with massive penalty clauses, so that it would cost a lot to stop the project.

We probably could have done it cheaper and less intrusively by piggybacking and upgrading the DVLA's driving licence system, by using it to issue photocards that don't confer driving privileges. That's how it tends to work in the US.

I'm doing history at university rn and the independent research and choosing of a title is pretty similar to the work I'm doing for seminars and essays etc, so it's also useful in that respect.

Oh I'm sure the left will always exist in some form or another.  Left wing rhetoric will probably always be popular with students.  But, it's seen its last days as a serious political force.

And I think that, in the long run, this could be a good thing.  No matter how its dressed up, Marxism is a failed ideology and nobody has ever managed to make it work.  

That's not to say that I think the right-wing have the answers.  In many ways I think their ideology is also failing.  You only have to look at the US Republican party to see just how nutty the right wing can get when taken to its logical conclusions.  The reason why the Conservatives are in power is because they've so far managed to check their worst instincts - although, now the liberal democrats are no more, even those checks are disappearing.

So, what will replace these old ideas?  

I think that modern democracies will (and *should*) move away from ideological thinking towards more evidence-based decision making.  And reality has neither a left - or a right-wing bias.

The task is to change the overarching narrative that austerity is the only way out of the mess Labour caused. If Corbyn can present a coherent alternative to austerity, and make a coherent argument against the accusations that Labour caused the crisis, then he'll already have the public on board with many of his key policies.

There are a lot of 'ifs', and it's going to be really fucking hard to sustain the enthusiasm Corbyn's campaign has generated, but I don't think it's impossible.

Out of the North London(ish) seats Labour increased their majorities in all but two of the seats - Enfield North and Holborn.

Labour did well in London. Also winning Islington is bread-and-butter for a Labour MP. It's the perfect mix of poorer communities who are Labour's core vote and a mix of rich liberals. There is a reason why Islington has become a by-word for a specific type of Labour which, ironically, probably isn't that represented by Corbyn but it's still Labour.

&gt;Just days before the Pentagon was set to begin training troops from Ukraine’s National Guard, including the notorious Azov Battalion, Kiev’s parliament voted 254-0 on April 10 to ban “communist propaganda,” communist symbols and anything deemed as “glorification” of Soviet history.

&gt;The same day, the parliament, known at the Verkhovna Rada, officially approved the ultra-right Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its successor, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). The Rada declared the two groups “freedom fighters” entitled to receive benefits under the new law.

&gt;The UPA/OUN and its leader, notorious Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera, worked hand in hand with Hitler Germany during its World War II occupation of Soviet Ukraine. Later, during the Cold War, the UPA/OUN worked with the CIA to carry out terrorist actions against the USSR.

&gt;Some 270 of the Rada’s 450 deputies voted in favor of the bill. No one dared vote against it.

&gt;Dmitry Yarosh, head of the fascist Right Sector and a Kolomoisky client, was appointed as a top advisor to Col. Gen. Viktor Muzhenko, chief of general staff of the Ukrainian military. Yarosh “will act as a link between the volunteer battalions and the General Staff,” military spokesperson Oleksiy Mazepa said.

What you've said about Agger is exactly what I'm trying to say. The fact he couldn't stay fit is why he got dropped, it had nothing to do with his ability as a footballer.

The key part of your sentence is '*when he plays*' - I totally agree with you.

Rebuilt and completely refurbished its schools, did the same for the two largest hospitals in the area, expanded nursery places, provided directed funds for retraining through the job centre network and rolled out Surestart nationally.

As a Labour supporter, former resident of Thorne, and a member of a family with five generations of Derbyshire/Yorkshire coal miners I agree with your sentiment. I expected direct assistance for the former mining communities after 97' and was very disappointed in the party hierarchy for not doing more. 

All that said. Talking to my Grandfather and other coal miners they did feel that they had received support as far as it was possible to give, and also recognised that by the time Labour came to power the damage was done and many of the former pit communities were simply not viable - too small or too remote, poor transport links, and nothing to keep the kids in the town.

Thorne was lucky - its proximity to motorways meant it could attract industry - many other communities not so much.

So when we sing god save the Queen, for me its just a national anthem, a song we sing about our nation. Kinda shit if you dont like the queen but what can you do. 

I hear alot of people saying that lately, how the idea of being proud of your nationality is weird since its choice. But when you look at people who migrate to a new country and then say ""Im proud to be from my home country"" or ""Im proud to be apart of this new country"" it puts things into perspective. 
Like im proud or happy to say im British since I like the History and things like that, but If I moved country I could turn around and realise im more aligned to that country.

not unreasonably, i imagine that your family member is expecting to make some sort of profit on their investment? assuming that is the case, you need to think carefully about how that will happen and what it will mean. 

- will you be sharing the lodger rent with the depositor? (looks like yes)
- will you be paying rent to the depositor on the 20% of the house that they own?
- if they are going to share in the ultimate upside, will they also contribute to costs? what would happen if you spent £20k putting a new kitchen in (which would increase the value of the property)?
- do they have any thoughts on the timing of their investment? are they going to want you to sell up and pay them back in 5 years, or remortgage and pay them back?

i'm not saying it can't work, but it is very complicated, and you need to test whatever agreement you come up with against different scenarios.  it's particularly important as you really don't want stuff like this driving a wedge between family members.

also, depending on how this is handled legally, the depositor is going to (effectively) own 20% of your house.  that will not make it easier to get a mortgage for the remaining 80% if the bank realise that someone not listed on the mortgage has a claim against part of the property. it will become close to impossible.

Labour were always going to get in power in 1997, and likely by a landslide even if they weren't a bit less centrist and promised to raise taxes a smidgeon. Blair's tack to the centre meant that their majority was going to be a super-landslide rather than just a boring old 100 seat majority.

In 2001 the Lib Dems were arguably to the left of Labour as they promised to raise taxes and spend it on education so 2001 and 2005 were probably the last elections where there was the stomach for tax rises being acceptable to the public.

Going to the front at the lights is usually the safe thing to do. Means cars know you're there. They put those boxes for cyclists at junctions for a reason.

Passing cars on a bike is a totally different situation from cars passing bikes. The car needs to leave room because cyclists may wobble, especially when climbing hills. Or they might have to avoid obstacles that wouldn't be apparent to car drivers, but might throw a rider off their bike. Cars are generally more predictable and don't suddenly move a metre to the side without warning. It's not unsafe to pick your way through traffic carefully.

Ok. I'll give it a go, but you might have to bear in mind that I don't think he's the second coming of Christ or anything, just the best of a bad lot.

&gt; He will be torn to shreds by the papers and by the Conservatives. There's not a chance in hell that Corbyn could ever win a general election.

This is why we can't have nice things. I agree with you. There is a strong media bias against any reduction of rich people's right to be rich. Put more mildly, I think there's a general ""society"" concensus made up of the media owners, heads of industry and top civil servants that there's a way the country should be. Whoever wins, we seem to get broadly similar governments - and I think there are a lot of people who like it that way.

I don't think Corbyn will get into power, and I do think he'll be attacked with a never-ending media storm he can't get past.

He's also not my ideal candidate. My ideal would be someone younger who understands technology and speaks to the internet generation and a country that's about to be transformed by robotics. Someone who thinks we need a decent defense force in Britain, but is opposed to mass surveillance, the war on drugs and the war on the middle east. Someone who thinks that the transformative power the internet has unleashed on the consumer sphere might be applied to government. Unfortunately that person probably isn't an MP, because which forward thinking person really thinks being an MP is a sensible thing to do these days?

So why would I think Corbyn is the best choice for Labour leader? Two reasons:

a) The other possible choices are really, really dire. A wise man once said that insanity is the art of doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results. The other three candidates are a vote for ""more of the same.""

b) I don't think the problem is getting into government. That's a second order problem for four years time. The current problem is the Overton window, where all main parties thought austerity was a good idea. I think that even as he falls into chaos, Corbyn will wrest that debate back towards the idea that in a democracy the voters ought to be presented with a choice, and the main party ought to be opposed and not applauded.",null,0,null,1439295190,null,null,1439295465,0,ctz1x8w,null,t3_3gij3j,null,null,null,t1_ctyi7xz,null,null,null,1440411718,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It does take a fair chunk of time to do properly - some people will write it in an evening, some will spend months doing it. Personally I spent a lot of time getting comfortable with the area I was writing about by reading books and articles, then spent about one or two weeks actually writing the thing. It wasn't too much of a time drain, I still managed to keep up with my other subjects at the same time.

Was it worth it? Well I doubt it actually got me any offers, if that's what you're asking. I only completed it a few months before exams, when I had received all my offers already. However, I was able to talk about it in good detail in my personal statement since I had done a fair amount of research at the time of writing it, and I think that probably helped somewhat in my application.

The biggest benefit is how much it prepares you for University style learning. During your degree, you will 100% need to use some of the skills you learn whilst doing your EPQ. Referencing is a big one, but individual time management and motivation are just as key.

That is such a vague and simplistic agreement that it can be said to essentially mean nothing at all.

&gt; When Blair started he presented himself as a pragmatist. ""It's not a matter of left or right but its what works.""

And that context-free one line quote is your proof of that, is it? Years before 9-11, [Blair was making speeches that stressed the moral basis](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/international-jan-june99-blair_doctrine4-23/) he believed should underpin the relations between states and their actions on trade, climate change and diplomacy - that interdependent western states connected by shared values of religious and racial tolerance, democracy and secular courts were the only way forward in the 21st century. That doesn't strike me as a statement of pragmatism (you can even find an explicit rejection of naked realpolitik early on in that link).

And the way his audience have conducted themselves since then hasn't even remotely proven him wrong. In fact it seems more like a cautionary tale AFTER the event: The British public forced Blair put of office, became nakedly self serving both in its attitude towards Iraq and the U.S. and increasingly insular on Europe and achy kind of serious involvement on events transpiring outside Europe; demanded that British forces remove themselves from Iraq and now we have ISIS running shit.

&gt; Sounds to me like the traffic's worse than you thought. Maybe you should leave ten minutes earlier tomorrow.

No, traffic was fine. Just one arsehole cyclist. He actually ran a red light to get into the thin bit of road before others - I think he enjoys the power.

HGV drivers and people towing are considerate enough to get out the way when they cause a massive tailback, are cyclists just areholes?

&gt; Going to the front at the lights is usually the safe thing to do. Means cars know you're there. They put those boxes for cyclists at junctions for a reason.

How does it make it safe to force people who have already overtaken you to overtake you again? How does it mean cars know you are there? 

&gt; The car needs to leave room because cyclists may wobble, especially when climbing hills. Or they might have to avoid obstacles that wouldn't be apparent to car drivers, but might throw a rider off their bike. Cars are generally more predictable and don't suddenly move a metre to the side without warning. It's not unsafe to pick your way through traffic carefully.

You need to leave enough room so if the cyclist falls over they don't go under your wheels. The only way you could think that doesn't also apply to the cyclist if you hadn't actually thought it through.

&gt; You're not allowed to decide the rules don't apply to you because you're frustrated. Would you get angry at somebody on a horse the way you do at a cyclist?

Horse riders are far, far, far, more considerate of other road users.

There really isn't that much you can do besides put on Sunscreen, reapply it often and stay out of the sun. I use a Sunscreen that whitens my skin a bit too, so you dont see them so much. 
If you're in your teens, chances are that it will naturally reduce (at least a little) when you're older.

You can make them fade by getting a special laser treatment, but they'll reappear when receiving too much sun exposure again! 

If you want you can try to get a physical sun block in the form of a parasol! Depending on your style, it can look quite nice too.

I'm not so sure that people are in favour of public ownership when you are honest about how much it would cost. If he wins Corbyn will eventually need to present a consistent, costed solution to the budget.

So there will need to be a budget proposal that outlines a combination of A) how much extra money we will need to borrow, and B) where cuts in other places will come. At the moment he is a million miles away being credible on this issue (e.g. £100bn extra from 'closing tax loopholes', which is pure fantasy, or printing money, which hurts everybody through inflation).

As a preamble, I should say that my own view is that Cameron's is one of the most extreme governments we've ever had in the UK, and that it's called up its own opposition. Just like in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, the rise of austerity is mirrored by the rise of anti-austerity parties. I think if Cameron had been more conciliatory and mild Corbyn would have got nowhere.

&gt;  isn't there a perfectly good non-conspiratorial reason for that? An alternative explanation for why parties don't deviate too much from the center, is simply because that's where the votes are.

Maybe. I'm not sure which way to call this one, and I think the jury's still out on it. Let's say that my view is that it's 50:50, with the media reflecting the public view and the media forming it.

I do think, though, that it's a bit difficult for the public to vote for a different view if they aren't actually presented with one!

&gt; but because Corbyn has extreme views which don't stand up to scrutiny. 

Again, I'm 50:50 on this one. I think you're right in that there are views which Corbyn holds which can be attacked successfully. And will be.

On the other hand, I think there are views which Cameron holds which can be attacked successfully, but which for some reason are not being attacked. Is that media bias? I think probably.

&gt; Politics is about getting elected.

Ohhh... Controversial statement!

I think politics is about getting policies into play that change people's lives for the better. You can have a politician who does that and never gets into government. If that's not the case, for example, you'd never have an MP in a party that isn't one of the big two. Likewise, someone can change the debate for the better even if their party does badly.

null,null,cathalhenry,,Belfast,null,"&gt; What is your opinion of McClean's treatment of the poppy, anthem and associated antics?

What way did he treat those symbols? His refusal to stand to attention for the British anthem was actually quite polite and respectful. He stood out, as he was the only one doing it. But he stood silently, with his head bowed, showing absolutely no disrespect.

I don't see his refusal to wear the poppy as disrespectful either, even if it was interpreted as such by the tabloids and others with a particularly nationalistic view of Britain.

He did have some idiotic exchanges with people from Twitter, which he was rightly criticised for. Personally, I do think he comes across as a bit of a dick at times.

That said, he obviously has genuine, deeply held political beliefs. That's hardly surprising, given his background. If he chooses to not stand to attention for an anthem, or wear a symbol of war remembrance. Should that not be respected, or at least tolerated?

&gt; So now the shoe's on the other foot and suddenly these same accounts are piling the blame on Parry? Reeks of hypocrisy.

There are several differences. The main one being that on one hand we have an individual who refuses to display or acknowledge political and military symbols, and on the other hand we have an individual who's making a fairly obvious and pointed political jibe. One of them is doing it for himself and the other is attempting to wind up others.

McClean may be an asshole, but we don't know him personally. What we do know is that he's made his choice of identity clear. I don't think it's appropriate for a sports commentator to pointedly disrespect that because he may feel his own sense of nationalism somehow threatened.

With regards to the ""usual characters"" on this sub. There's plenty who defend and malign McClean, and that usually reflects their own sense of Irish or British nationalism. Some may even say you're one of them.

null,null,Bigpinkbackboob,null,null,null,"IANAL, but you can demonstrate that you've been giving her the money for rent etc. in good faith. There's likely not anything concrete specifying that it's for rent unless that's what you ""called"" the standing order, but as it's the same/similar amount regularly ever since you moved in she'd have to come up with a pretty magical reason for people to not think it was rent. You can prove you were sending her the money, I wouldn't fret about that part too much.

However, yes it might affect your standing with the HA. They may sometimes look into your rental history, so it might be better to look elsewhere for a place but definitely do not get yourself into a similar situation again. Then again, almost everyone will ask you for your previous address, so maybe try explaining it to the HA and showing them the standing order? No idea if that would work out in your favour though... If you can't afford a ""normal"" flat on your own, houseshares usually work out quite a bit cheaper - bills, council tax, etc. tends to be included in the rent, and rent usually goes straight from you to the LL/letting agent - no splitting bills and trusting others with your money. 

In future, if you end up sharing a flat with someone again, I highly recommend setting up a joint bank account (in BOTH your names) you both pay into, and have all the bills paid from there. That way you can both keep an eye on it, and neither person has to blindly trust the other. It's also way easier to each just pay in the same amount each month rather than ""I'll cover ABC things if you cover XYZ"", and it means your name is on the payment source even if it's not on the bills themselves. Even if you do set things up like this eventually, it would ultimately be better if you could also get your name on the bills. It's not that hard, I'm pretty sure it can be done with one phone call to each bill provider (the person whose name is originally on the bill has to call, though) and you can them call them if there are any problems since they usually won't speak to you about an account if you're not the owner of it. Just make sure you're not the only name on it if you're not the only tenant.

But no, from a layperson's point of view you don't appear to be too horribly fucked. And on the bright side, since your name wasn't on anything I don't think it'll affect your credit rating. Silver linings and all that...

As much as Ramsey is the focus of the article, I feel like the constraints that we're working under are more important to our current situation than simply the manager and a change of 'culture'. Les Ferdinand in his role as DoF has been key to arranging transfers, which has limited what Ramsey can and cannot do, who he can sign etc. It's a nice change of pace from bringing in Redknapp and Hughes style signings (i.e. throw money at players and hope they get the job done), but you can tell that we're inexperienced in this style of working as Fer, Austin and Phillips are still on our books, the latter two with only a year left on their deals, so we're at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with other clubs. To top it all off, we're also in a poor situation vis a vis GKs. I like Green, he's been a model pro, but he's not a long term option and losing McCarthy was a kick in the teeth. 

I'm also assuming Hoos, new CEO, has some input over the transfers and running of the club, and was brought in to help shore up our finances. I have no idea what he's been doing behind the scenes, but that is an additional contraint that I assume Ramsey has to work under. Maybe he had to do something with us bringing in a GK coach last week. The same here could also be said about our new co-chairman, the money man, and TF's moving back from the hands on running of the club, though maybe he works more long term, again I can't really say.

Finally, we have the hangover of last season and another shitty preseaon. I think the lapses at Charlton are exactly the same kinds of issues that dogged us last season, fatigue, lack of concentration and (again) a shitty preseason. Quite a few local journos and even the author of the piece write about consolidation, but what does that mean? Beyond that, surely, the club should have arranged a better preseason? I think it means that we're about a month behind in terms of preparations, than where we should be, and it shows. Clive mentioned  in the GBBO podcast from last week that he doesn't see us getting many (or any) points from our first three games, and that is in danger of coming true. So how long until our fans turn on him? 

Anyway, this is just a conglomeration of thoughts put together from other sources etc, and I just wanted to put them down somewhere.

* If it is legal: Prescribers details, signature, date etc
* If it is complete: Drug information, strength and dosage
* If it is clinically appropriate: Interactions, redundancies due to medication being taken already, if the medication will have any predicted effect on treatment

https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide

Every time someone &lt;30 says 'no point in voting, it doesn't change anything' just needs to look at the link above.

Mollifying older people and pensioners will get governments in to power, ~77% of them vote so they hold a lot of sway.

Only 43% of 'young Britons' vote, why spend time/effort/money canvassing them? I can get access to nearly 2x more votes by making a pensioner happy.

The prevailing orthodoxy is ""So what if young Britons don't like something the government does, what are they going to do, share it on facebook?""

This is a sad state of affairs but given the stats above it looks like we have got the government we deserve; one who was voted in by home-owning middle class people &gt;40yo. They are now busily looking after the wants and needs of their core constituency. This has come at the expense of so called apathetic 'young Britons'. It's a vicious circle. Voter apathy means there is no point in reaching out to the young. As a result no parties speak to issues young people care about.

The first can be easily remedied: the government ought to offer free language lessons to all immigrants, just like other countries do. People hate not being able to talk to people in English, especially the older generations who have lived in England all their life. As for islam, the party doesn't understand just how much the average voter hated walking down the street and seeing a huge proportion of the women hiding their faces.

Being in front of the cars allows the cyclist to move over, safely, in their own time, and allow cars to pass.  It puts them in control of the situation, rather than having to jostle with people trying to squeeze by.  It's the safest way. And the cyclist isn't *forcing* anybody to do anything, any more than the car in front of you is *forcing* you to wait behind it.  Again, *bikes are traffic*, treat them as such.

In Britain, the polytechnics and technical colleges are really thought of as substandard universities, aspiring towards pure research, rather than something which is valuable in its own right. Even people from the left often have strong ideas about educating the poor to be more like the rich, not realizing that much of that sort of education is made up of a series of status symbols for groups that live on ownership of assets (which is inherently not scalable), not the skills that give you actual, objective power to operate in the economy.

It's not a vague concept. It has not been a success by common understanding.

I guess someone can call it a success if they chose narrow disingenuous criteria.

&gt; What if someone supported the war on the belief that we would benefit through increased corporation with that country's oil industry - have they been proven wrong?

You mean what if they supported the war entirely to get access to the oil. Well there would probably be cheaper ways that didn't involve as much death that gives us access to the oil. But hey I guess it depends on who's paying.

&gt; Or if someone supported the war on the proviso that only s continued constabulary role for the allied military would effect a secure country - have they been shown wrong?

That sounds like decades of war and occupation. That was not what was promised. The allies were not in a ""constabulary role."" It was occupation and conflict. It took a dictator to hold the country together.

Thinking it was possible to invade and then keep the peace was part of the delusion.

You're always going to be able to find an economist to prove whatever position, unanimity isn't required. Austerity is widely discredited in academia, at least in terms of its benefit to the public at large, and Labour should have found a way to make that position palatable to the public.

&gt; Right or wrong people instinctively feel that indefinitely running large deficits is a bad thing.

It is the duty of politicians to lead. That can mean informing and persuading the public to your point of view, not merely drifting with the currents. The Tories were highly successful in crafting a narrative of Labour causing the financial crisis (which in reality was bobbins) and austerity being necessary while Labour failed to persuade people of any kind of narrative of their own, instead choosing to fight all the battles on the Tories' terms (and lose). 

&gt; Besides which the Labour party did not advocate a radical Krugman-esc fiscal policy so they could not fight on that line.

This is another thing I'm criticising them for and exactly what is driving Corbyn's success. In the last 5 years they were an opposition without an alternative, fueling the public perception of them as ""Red Tories"". Why should people believe in an opposition that broadly agrees with the ruling party?

In its entire history the Labour party has never received more than 50% of the vote.

You invest in capital projects that stimulate the economy and increase GDP. Austerity reduces government spending, which in turn reduces growth. There's a good argument to suggest that Osborne's policies have actually hampered the economy recovery as opposed to boosting it. 

&gt;We fix the economy, they propose to undo all our work.

We've now had 5 years of a Tory government, we're going to have 5 more. In that time, Osborne has totally revised his forecasts regarding the economy and deficit reduction.

It has done though, you can hardly deny that. 

The current personal allowance is *three times* higher now than it was when I entered the workforce. That increase undeniably helped those on low and middle incomes.

I guess it depends entirely on what you mean by 'low income' though. Anyone working full-time, even at the current minimum wage, was helped out by the trebling of the personal allowance. As the minimum wage rises to £9 over the next few years it'll help even more people out, and raising the personal allowance further still will help even more.

null,null,sunnygovan,scottish,Govan,null,"&gt; Bikes are traffic too.

Yes... the only issue with the traffic was one arsehole. Not seeing your point here at all. One arsehole driver doesn't make for bad traffic either. So no, the traffic was fine - one operator of a vehicular conveyance however was a complete prick. Better?

&gt; In all probablility he ran the red light to get out of the way. 

Aye? Curious how you came to that conclusion. I should also point out my other reason for believing him to be an arsehole was the way he went round the two-lane roundabout at the end  of the thin bit in the middle (ie on the dividing line). But I'm sure you'll make up something to justify that too.

&gt; Being in front of the cars allows the cyclist to move over, safely, in their own time, and allow cars to pass. It puts them in control of the situation, rather than having to jostle with people trying to squeeze by. It's the safest way. And the cyclist isn't forcing anybody to do anything, any more than the car in front of you is forcing you to wait behind it. Again, bikes are traffic, treat them as such.

And being further back in the queue changes this how exactly? I'm pretty sure a cyclist could still do al those things at the back - or even in the middle. 

Again I am treating bikes as traffic, if a car overtook me then drove at 5mph I'd be frustrated with them too.

&gt; Because hopefully you're looking out your windscreen now and again in between sending text messages?

Now you are being silly - your answer has little, if anything to do with the question. What has the cyclists position in the queue got to do with how visible they are?

To be honest, I think that I *would* find it hard to imagine the iPhone being produced by a very much more socialist society.  

I'm not saying that some degree of socialism (e.g. the NHS) can't be a good thing, but I think there's a reason why virtually all of the advances in science and technology over the last century have been produced by open, democratic, and yes, capitalistic societies - as opposed to nations like Cuba, Russia or Venezuela.  

Capitalism incentivizes competition and it's only through ruthless competition that we've managed to drive down prices and produce products like the iPhone which are affordable to the majority of people.  Can you seriously imagine a state-owned company innovate a product like the iPhone, and for that price?

I concede and I agree. I would actually say most politicians will accept that they have to cut a path between pragmatism and idealism.

We could all pick and choose vague political rhetoric to catch out a politician.

I would say he did position himself as a pragmatist at the beginning however. The liberalist interventionism works ok on small wars that are cheap and easy. The proposed necon military tour of middle east countries was nor pragmatic. It was idealist, radical and dangerous.

The state of Iraq, the split into factions the rise of ISIS is pretty much the worse case scenario of what people thought would happen in Iraq. You would be asking for years and years of war.

Maybe a few decades we have some kind of peace through attrition and stalemate. I guess at that point you'd call it a success. If you had to spend billions and kill millions of people, triggering civil wars and bloody revolutions in the process, what's the point?

I just think this was bad decision, badly executed, it resulted in a civil war, cost billions, destabilised the middle further, inflamed Muslim opinion and cost millions of lives.

Granted, Mignolet made a lot of mistakes in his first year with us, but there's no guarantee that Reina wouldn't have made those mistakes also. Reina was a bit of a character as a goalkeeper, he had a few high profile areas of weakness and Mignolet for Sunderland always seemed to me like a good all round player.

thats not true though. And even if it where, there are plenty of mostly flat towns and cities around the uk. 

&gt;in the basis of numbers, they are. More people drive, more people would appreciate better roads to drive on

Which is the problem. Most people drive because driving is the only real option. Its so bad now kids have stopped walking and cycling to school in the UK. Where in many parts of Europe as much as 75% of kids cycle to school. Of Course they are not taxpayers though are they...

&gt;Maybe cyclists who expect the taxpayer to pay for special cycle lanes would not agree.

Cyclists last time I checked are taxpayers too. And of course this misses the point. 

Cyclists, motorists etc, are all people, not different species who are independent from each other. If ""taxpayers"" pay for things that benefit ""taxpayers"" I see no issue. 

Edit - just to elaborate a little here....You could spend a fraction of the transport budget and get 5-10% cycling uptake if we wanted. That would save the nation money, year on year.

A comforting notion but not one I subscribe to. More accurately, you could make the case that most major tech advances are made within nations that rise to the status of being a major world power regardless of the ideological fluff around it all. It's not capitalism or democracy that enables these things - it's the patronage of innovators by political power and massive wealth.

The Soviet Union weren't democratic or open and yet...

* discovered Stem cells 

* created the earliest TV cameras

* flew the first 'flying wing' delta aircraft

* invented the LED

* invented telerecording

* first military robot

* electric rocket propulsion

* blood banks

* the drum machine (seems trivial but it's an important step to today's electronic music)

* the artificial heart

* discovered superfluidity

* first satellite in space

* first man in space

* major improvements to particle accelerator technology

* heart and lung transplants

* modern multi-stage rocket engines

* first nuclear power plant

and that barely scratches the surface. The Soviet Union didn't stop innovating like this until it reached a critical level of economic stagnation and began a relative decline on the world stage.

When China starts speeding ahead with innovations in cybernetics, green energy and nano-tech maybe people will start to realise this false notion of Liberal history - ""democracy and free markets are necessary for innovation"" - is simply an consequence of today's victors writing yesterday's history.

It's worth considering that in the same way that BR was ""given"" players he didn't want, there's a good chance his hands were tied with some players he wanted to keep. Sure, some of these were partially or even largely sporting decisions (e.g. Gerrard and Carra as bit-part players) rather than contractual, but it's down to Rodgers to decide what is best for the team **given what he has got.**

We can't blindly compare player departures to incomings and say that it was a poor decision in retrospect. We could have done better, and sure enough this summer, we have. Even if it's early days, these are the sort of signings that will fix the problems we have. 

We can argue that we needed an improvement on Lucas (and I've seen plenty do so) but it's reality that in some cases we need to *replace* rather than *add* to make the books and team balance.

In almost all the youtube videos I see of cyclists being overtaken closely it could have been avoided if they were not cycling practically in the gutter. It feels safer to cycle closer to the pavement but it is actually a lot more dangerous than riding in a more prominent position in the road. You should be cycling in almost the middle of the lane which will do three things for you.

1. You will be way more visible to cars, if you are directly in front of them they are guaranteed to see you whereas someone not paying enough attention to the road could easily miss a cyclist riding next to the pavement.

2. Car drivers will be forced to move into the other lane in order to overtake you. This means that drivers will be forced to move around you rather than try and squeeze past you, and will force them to slow down and overtake at a safe place. The further a car has to move to overtake you, the safer you will be. (within reason)

3. The quality of the road is better so you are less likely to hit potholes which can be dangerous or sharp objects such as glass which can puncture your tires.

Some cyclists go through red lights shortly before they change for this reason.  I don't condone it, but I do understand it.

&gt; I should also point out my other reason for believing him to be an arsehole was the way he went round the two-lane roundabout at the end of the thin bit in the middle (ie on the dividing line). But I'm sure you'll make up something to justify that too.

I get this, actually.  Once I was going round a roundabout on my bike, in the middle of the outside lane, keeping myself safe and out of trouble.  I was going straight on.

A woman in the *inside lane* cut right across me to take the first exit.  I ended up going down a turn I had no intention of taking and had to push myself off her car to stop her running me over.

Apparently this was my fault because ""I didn't indicate"".  ""Er, actually when you're going straight, you don't indicate till you reach the exit of the turn before the one you're taking.

So maybe this individual was just trying to stay safe on the roundabout.  I get that it might have been annoying, but generally when on the road, whether you're in a car or on a bike, it's best to assume everybody else is an idiot, because they usually are.

Obviously I wasn't there and I don't know what happened and I don't know what the roundabout's like.  And I don't really know what you mean by ""thin bit"" either.

&gt; What has the cyclists position in the queue got to do with how visible they are?

Think about this for a second.  Where is a cyclist most visible to you when you're in your car?  In front, behind or to the sides?

In front, obviously.  So logically it makes sense for the bike to go to the front of *all* the cars, because otherwise it's behind or to the side of at least *somebody*.

null,null,Akeem_of_Zamunda,null,null,null,"Ok, let me set it out for you as simply as possible.

Villa are likely to play 442 or 433. This means two of the 11 players will play in attacking wide positions.

So who do Villa have who will play there in the coming season? Note, this question is not ""Who does Chamber37 or Akeem think ought to play there"", but ""Who, with all the knowledge of your average fan, will play there"". 

Well, let's go through the choices. Actually, to make sure that you understand completely, I have excluded for the sake of brevity all players who have never and will never play in that position. For example, Philippe Senderos, Ashley Westwood or Brad Guzan. I hope that is self-explanatory but if you need further clarification for their exclusion, let me know.

1. Carles Gil: [X] Sherwood mentioned in pre-season that (1) there is a future for him at Villa, and sees him playing centrally. Not a contender.
2. Jack Grealish: [X] Sherwood mentioned numerous times that Grealish will play through the middle. Not a contender.
3. Leandro Bacuna: [Y] Likely to play there. Lennon is better in every way apart from final delivery.
4. Gabby Agbonlahor: [Y] Likely to play there. Not good enough. Lennon is in every way better in that position.
5. Scott Sinclair: [Y] Likely to play there. More direct than Lennon, but will offer less width. Likely to be our first choice on the flanks.
6. Callum Robinson: [X] on loan. Not in contention.
7.  Jordan Ayew: [?] We don't know what Sherwood's intentions are with Ayew. We also have no idea of his ability at this stage. Chamber37's assessment is that he can play on the wing. We will go with Chamber37's assessment.

Any others I have missed? Please let me know if you disagree with my assessment. Remember, this is not a question of who you think ought to play there, but a question of who will play there (having considered all of the circumstances). Of that list, we have three definites and perhaps one ""maybe"". Of those four, Lennon would be a significant improvement over at least two of them. 

Even if Sinclair and Ayew were first choice wingers, I know I'd much rather have an Aaron Lennon on the bench for the long, hard season ahead, than have to rely on Gabby or Bacuna in those positions. I don't think it's arguable at all to say he would improve those positions, even if you keep saying ""arguable"". 

All in all, as mentioned right at the top of this chain, I don't think 5 million is at all extortionate.

We need more cycle paths, because the road is build for vehicles, not cyclists, they don't even pay road tax to pay for the roads. 

I got into an argument with a cyclist which showed how hypocritical and self centered they are, as I said it would be better if they were allowed on the pavement. As it'll keep them out of the way of vehicles, the path is usually empty or nearly empty, and that a pedestrian hit by a bike is better than a bike crushed by a car. 

The cyclists response was, and I quote:

&gt;What makes you so important that everyone else should get out of your way?

&gt;I wouldn't cycle on the pavement even if I had the option - and often I won't use a cycle lane on the pavement. Why? Because I don't want to trundle along at 10mph, moving out the way of pedestrians, giving way at side roads, hitting crooked paving stones etc. when I could be cruising at 20mph+ on the road. 

Everyone sees the hypocrisy and entitlement there right? He won't go on the path because pedestrians will slow him down, and be in his way, so he goes on the road getting in the way of vehicles, slowing us down and getting in our way, taking advantage of the road we paid for.

##On the road to the coup

Seizing upon the country as a bulwark against Russia, the West hoped to weaken Moscow’s authority on the world stage and prejudice its economic interests – by ‘fair’ means or foul.

It seemed at first that the elected Kiev government under President Yanukovych could be cajoled and bullied into signing a trade deal with the EU that would tie the country to imperialist interests at the expense of simultaneously lowering the living standards of its own people and exposing its Russian neighbour to the dumping of cheap exports.

Yet when the moment came to sign off the deal, the government abruptly recoiled from the prospect of trying to sell the accompanying IMF restructuring plans to the general population. The 28 EU member states that gathered in Vilnius last November for an ‘Eastern Partnership’ summit, on a promise that the wandering Ukrainian sheep would at last be definitively joining the EU/Nato fold, instead witnessed Yanukovych’s refusal to sign up.

So, with ‘fair’ means failing, it was time to turn to ‘foul’ ones. If the elected government failed to dance dutifully enough to the West’s tune, then (in the name of democracy, of course) it had to be replaced by one that would be more biddable.

The ‘pro-EU’ demonstrations which then erupted on Independence Square – shamelessly egged on by the West – represented the sentiments of some in the west of the country in combination with the interests of a Kiev elite, and were infected from the outset with the poisonous traces of the fascism to which Ukrainian nationalism was so drawn in WWII, and which it is now revisiting with a vengeance. When Yanukovych refused to sign the EU trade pact, the unexpected setback for those who yearned to submit to western domination had the effect of prematurely triggering what appeared to be a destabilisation plan originally intended as a disruption of the elections due in 2015, but now brought forward in a panic.

Over three months, the protesters, led by an assortment of rival parties which had all been beaten hollow at the last election in 2012 and increasingly geed up by an even less representative ragbag of jew-baiters, pogromists and all-round fascists, graduated from placard-waving to violent provocations, seizures of administrative centres and intimidation against the MPs of the elected Party of the Regions.

Meanwhile, the western media glorified the protests as supposedly being the latest expression of ‘democratic’ ‘people power’ against ‘tyranny’, demonised the elected government, and sabotaged all efforts to resolve the crisis through negotiation.

On 21 February, the elected government pledged itself to abide by a compromise deal with opposition leaders that had been brokered by Germany, France and Poland, under which a ‘national-unity’ government would be formed, the president would cede some of his powers, and elections would be brought forward to December this year.

Within hours, however, this solemn agreement was torn up by the rebels. The governing party’s MPs were forced to flee parliament in fear of their lives, the remaining rump named Olexander Turchynov as interim president and the leader of Yulia Tymoshenko’s Fatherland party (Washington’s favoured candidate) Arseniy Yatsenyuk as prime minister, and an arrest warrant was issued for the country’s democratically-elected president.

Not a murmur was raised in the Western media over the cynical way in which the compromise agreement, witnessed and sanctioned by two major powers, was simply thrown under the wheels of the advancing fascist coup. Rather, it was cheered on unreservedly.

##Resistance grows

What the West did not reckon on was the scale of the resistance that its meddling would provoke. In major cities throughout the industrialised east of the country (where the Russian-speaking are strongly represented), thousands have come onto the streets to denounce the coup and beg the Russian Federation to protect them from the hostile actions of the illegal regime now wielding power in the west of the country.

In Kharkov, the thousand or so activists gathered to defend the city’s Lenin monument grew to nearly 5,000 later in the day, standing outside a local administration building to demand a referendum. Similar protests have been witnessed in Lugansk, where 3,000 activists blocked the regional administration building. About a thousand of them went on to occupy the HQ, raising the Russian flag and demanding the resignation of Mikhail Bolotskikh, the regional governor parachuted in by Kiev.

In Donetsk, in a stand-off between anti-coup protesters and police, the administrative HQ was occupied by activists. When eventually the police siege ousted the occupation, the protesters gathered their forces, judged their moment and then broke through police cordons again, reoccupying the building and hoisting the Russian flag aloft.

The city has seen a wave of anti-coup protest triggered by the rump parliament’s decree removing Russian, as well as minority, language rights. Protesters are demanding control of the regional police force and the severing of ties with the coup regime.

Protests in Donetsk, as in Lugansk, are directed in particular at the imposition of unelected officials sent in by Kiev to ensure subordination of regional powers to the new illegal authorities. In the case of Donetsk, the new would-be ‘governor’ is Sergey Taruta, the billionaire owner of mining giant ISD.

In the time between his appointment and his arrival, the citizenry of Donetsk swiftly chose their own ‘people’s governor’, Pavel Gubarev. Gubarev has subsequently been kidnapped by Special Security Forces and taken to Kiev on sedition charges.

##Crimea

Naturally, the most serious resistance to date has been that in the Crimea, which has now by an overwhelming majority of 96.77 percent voted to join the Russian Federation. Western carping ahead of the referendum failed to explain how this democratic plebiscite was deemed to be in conflict with international law, whilst the actions of the ‘Kosovo Liberation Army’ gangsters in ripping Kosovo away from Serbia (without even the pretence of a vote) was applauded by Tony Blair, William Hague et al.

Russia’s Black Sea fleet has been permanently stationed in Crimea under long-standing fraternal agreements entered into with Ukraine. Contrary to claims that Russia had ‘invaded’ Crimea, existing agreements authorised the garrisoning of up to 25,000 soldiers, although in normal times only around half of this number would be in place. With the elected government in the Ukraine overthrown by a fascist coup, these are hardly normal times.

Western reporting has sown deliberate confusion between the identities of conventional Russian forces on one hand and the activities of local self-defence militia drawn from the local population. These militia are variously misrepresented as the Russian army in disguise or as criminal gangs – anything, in short, rather than acknowledging the simple truth that they are local defence forces, drawn from the working class and tasked with the protection of Crimea’s liberty from illegal infringement.

Moreover, the number of Soviet flags and hammers and sickles evident in nearly every demonstration, along with the central place assumed by the defence of Lenin monuments, shows that strong sentiment exists among the masses not only for reunification with Russia, but also for the reconstitution of socialism.

As the revolt against the coup spreads beyond Crimea and across the east of Ukraine, it appears that western hopes of dragging Ukraine under effective imperialist control, complete with the industrialised heartlands of the east, are backfiring badly.

##Ankara and the Crimean Tatars

Whilst the media remain obsessed with attributing Ukraine’s difficulties to the supposedly sinister activity of Russian ‘foreigners’, it turns out that the real interlopers are not arriving from that quarter at all. It was not for nothing that Russian forces and local militia together have taken control over two airports, turning back incoming flights from Turkey.

Having failed to topple Syria’s legitimate government (despite an enormous expenditure of time and money sheltering and funding jihadist terrorists in that region), Ankara is now trying its luck with another band of putschists, sending its foreign minister to pay a courtesy call to the Kiev regime, where he asserted that “the status of Crimea amid the Ukraine crisis cannot be determined without Turkey playing a role”.

The nature of this role becomes clearer as reports surface of the involvement of the Turkish intelligence services in the coup. According to French news site Egalité et Réconciliation, one of those incoming flights from Turkey (now happily nipped in the bud) had on board dozens of Crimean Tatar jihadists. Trained by Turkey and previously deployed in Syria, they had planned to switch to the Ukraine – just the latest country to be turned into a battlefield by the crisis-stricken imperialist war drive.

Tatars, once present in larger numbers in the Crimea, sadly suffered the inevitable consequences of their leaders’ active collaboration with the murderous Nazi occupation. After the war, they were transferred en masse in the overall interests of national security and specifically in an effort to remove the soil in which fascism had so rankly flourished.

In fact, the transfer was also in the interests of the Tatars’ own safety, since collaborators were not exactly popular with the majority of the locals who had suffered so appallingly under Nazi occupation. Despite having been ‘rehabilitated’ and ‘repatriated’ by Khrushchev as part of his anti-Stalin propaganda drive, many of those that remain or have since returned are nursing a historical grievance that imperialism is very happy to exploit for its own ends.

So it is that Tatars came to act as hired muscle in the Maidan, and in the Crimea celebrated the announcement of the coup by attacking an anti-coup rally in the capital Simferopol with rocks, bottles and fists, resulting in a score of injuries and one death.

Voice of Russia reports have revealed leaked email traffic between coup-leaders in Kiev and Tatars in Crimea which indicate that the planned bloodshed had greater ambitions, looking to coordinate efforts between Tatar sympathisers and Banderista groups. (Stepan Bandera, whose portrait is borne aloft by the reactionaries as they trample on monuments to Lenin, was a notorious Nazi collaborator in the last war.)

An email cockily announced that: “Everything is going according to the plan. We are ready to proceed with the second part of the play. As agreed earlier last week, my guys together with people from the ‘Karpatskaya Sech’ and UNA-UNSO [two fascist outfits] will arrive wherever is needed and with the necessary weapons. You only need to let us know the addresses of the warehouses in Simferopol, Sevastopol, Kerch, Feodosia and Yalta, and the time of the meeting ... Don’t worry about the money, everything will be fine, just a little bit later. In the end, you know that if we succeed, you will get a lot more.”

Thanks to the alert response from the Crimean masses and the proximity of the Russian army, these western-backed efforts to arrange a historical rematch of WW2 (with a new ending) look set to be fruitless.

Erdogan’s meddling in Syria, not to mention his egregious corruption, has already earned him the hatred of the Turkish masses. Now his promotion of jihad in the Ukraine and Crimea can only deepen that hatred, currently erupting onto the streets after the death, following months in a coma, of the teenager, Berkin Elvan, slain by a police gas canister as he went to buy bread for his family.

##Odd bedfellows

In addition to meddling by Turks and Tatars, other players are turning up to present themselves as unlikely friends of Ukraine.

Israel, whose active role in promoting jihadism against Syria even extended to recruiting Algerian muslims, is now joining forces with outright anti-semites. It seems that when it comes to serving the ends of world imperialism, trivial differences in creed or principle may be swept aside with impunity.

So it was that the Times of Israel reported that ‘Delta’, a former soldier in the Israeli Defence Forces who was born in the Ukraine, was in charge of a 40-strong paramilitary unit calling itself the Blue Helmets and run by five former IDF soldiers. Delta told the journalist that he took his orders from Svoboda, an outright fascist party with impeccable anti-semitic views and a strong hand on the ‘protest’ tiller.

Whilst Delta claims that his fascist bosses treat him like a ‘brother’, the fragility of this fraternity is revealed when he explains the real reason for adopting his absurd nom de guerre. “If I were Ukrainian, I would have been a hero,” he tells the journalist. “But for me it’s better to not reveal my name if I want to keep living here in peace and quiet.” (28 February 2014)

##Own goal for imperialism, suffering for the people

It is starting to dawn on the West that, having engineered a proxy civil war in the Ukraine – in the process stirring up antagonisms which largely lay dormant throughout the years in which the republic was one of the most productive in the Soviet Union, and all in the hope of drawing Ukraine fully into the EU/Nato-led camp and building up the country as a bulwark against the Russian Federation – its only reward will be to see the confirmation of Russian influence in the region, the further humiliation of US hegemonic aspirations and the possible break-up of the country.

This disintegration, if it occurs, will be entirely the responsibility of the dog-in-the-manger West, which would prefer to see a broken Ukraine than tolerate one that baulked at complete assimilation by imperialism.

And as the scale of the West’s failure over Ukraine dawns more generally, the feel-good mood music around the latest ‘colour revolution’ is giving way to mutual recrimination.

The world has already earwigged on the harmonious relations obtaining between Berlin and Washington as revealed in Victoria Nuland’s infamous “fuck the EU” phone call. Now we have the Estonian foreign minister – not the most probable whistle-blower – spilling the beans to the EU’s Catherine Ashton about what really happened on the Maidan, where it turns out that the snipers who were responsible for much of the death toll, and who were universally reported in the western media as doing the work of the government, [were in fact under orders from the coup-plotters themselves.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31359021)

“There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition,” Arms Paet told Ashton, who is clearly flummoxed by what she is hearing, stammering “I think we do want to investigate. I mean, I didn’t pick that up, that’s interesting. Gosh.” (But gosh, whatever happened to that investigation Catherine?)

Paet went on to recount the testimony of Olga Bogomolets, the doctor who ran the Maidan mobile clinic, treating the gravely injured. He noted that the doctor “told as well that all the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among policemen and then people from the streets, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides ... So that she then also showed me some photos she said that as a medical doctor she can say that it is the same handwriting, the same type of bullets, and it’s really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don’t want to investigate what exactly happened.” The Estonian foreign minister concluded that the whole sniper issue “already discredits from the very beginning” the new Ukrainian power.

Just how popular the discredited puppet government of Arseniy Yatsenyuk will prove to be with Ukrainians as the chilling embrace of the IMF restructuring makes itself felt on a society already divided between an elite of rival monopoly capitalists and increasingly impoverished masses, remains to be seen.

They may have lost the military prize of Crimea, but the West are still pushing ahead with as much of their agenda as is within their control. Within days of the coup, Ukraine’s gold reserves had been spirited away to New York (following those of Libya that have also been quietly disappeared since a proxy government was bombed into power in Tripoli in 2011), while the back-of-a-fag-packet corporate wish-list of draconian cuts to social spending has already started making its way through the comprador parliament.

The €11bn loan dangled like a carrot in front of a donkey by the EU brings with it, unlike the larger sum previously pledged by Russia, a very big stick indeed for a population that is already suffering dire poverty levels: rising gas bills, frozen government salaries, slashed pensions, and budget cuts for 2014 alone estimated at between $6.8bn and $8.4bn. Long after the pro-EU banners have been folded up and put away, the reality of tutelage to a US and western Europe that are themselves in major crisis will impose intolerable burdens on the people – burdens which they are unlikely to bear with any degree of equanimity.",null,1,null,1439301486,null,null,false,0,ctz4p6e,null,t3_3gkno8,null,null,null,t1_ctz4p2p,null,null,null,1440413074,null,-4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

null,null,mushroomgodmat,null,null,null,"&gt;Cyclists (who want to be able to cycle everywhere and want all these cycle paths at enormous expense) are going to be a very small minority of all taxpayers. We have larger priorities.

You missed the point.

2pc of road users are cyclists. They currently are the 2pc who are brave enough to cycle on the road with cars. And they are mostly male.

It does not take much imagination to put two and two together and realise that there are millions of other people who could, if cycling was safer actually cycle. 

And we know this to be the case. Because cycling numbers go up when you spend money on making it safe.

So when you say 

&gt;who want to be able to cycle everywhere and want all these cycle paths at enormous expense

you miss the point. Its not about current cyclists (though they are the ones who shout loudest) its about encouraging non cyclist to cycle. 


&gt;We have larger priorities.

If you distill it into simple terms like you have I might agree, but getting people out of cars (for literally 100s of reasons) is not a small priority. Well, it shouldn't be. 

&gt;cycle paths at enormous expense

just as an illustration.

Close to me they are building a small 8 mile bypass, it's going to cost £150 million. That one road is more than the total spend in the uk on cycling infrastructure. 

&gt;And who may well continue to drive anyway.

without doubt. 

Its not about replacing the car. Its about getting 5-20% of people out of their cars, or being less reliant on their car. 

I still use my car every day. I just dont use it for every journey. 

&gt;Not everyone wants to arrive at work all sweaty and in need of a shower. 

short sighted. 

Put cycle paths down and the need to cycle at full whack, in dangerous traffic is gone. You can cycle and exert no more energy than walking. 

&gt;I'd bet that's down to their parents' choice rather than need

Absolutely. Im sure kids would love to cycle and walk.....but their parents fear of traffic plays a massive part in the problem. Which is one primary reason those cyclists you mention want cycle paths. 

Edit...

&gt;I'd bet if you said ""we have £Xm to spend on transport around here, what do you want"" - cycle paths would struggle to get out of last place

I agree totally.

But this is a problem with understanding and general attitude. I bet if cycling was sold as a safe, cheap way to travel, which could extend your life and save the nation millions in NHS costs and road building, and potentially keep your kids safe from traffic (on cycle paths to schools) I'm sure there would be more interest in the prospect. But as it is, whenever anything cycling is mentioned those are never, if rarely used to sell the idea.

null,null,stax_n_stax,null,null,null,"&gt; I'm also assuming Hoos, new CEO, has some input over the transfers and running of the club, and was brought in to help shore up our finances.

The way he rattled off the 750k loss per match on his QPR Player Interview, it's obviously something he's taking seriously. Even as I type this, I'm seeing Bristol City going in for Gayle, Hull linked to Gray and Brentford have just apparently gone in for a young Dutch striker from the Eredivisie. I think not being able to keep pace with other teams financially is going to be a big adjustment for some fans to take - although saying that, we've spent reasonably lavishly on the 5 we've paid for.

He must have arrived too late to have any bearing on the mess of a pre-season, so hopefully his presence can avoid any repeat of that particular farce.

&gt;consolidation, but what does that mean?

Mainly getting the business of QPR back on its feet, I'd say. Making sure that the club lives largely within its means, any losses are acceptable, all money spent is done so wisely. Basically steadying the ship back at square one, functional and as safe as any football club can be, and moving forward from there.

I don't know where I'm supposed to gauge the general feeling about things at QPR now. Loftus Road? Online? Away matches? The pub? As has been written elsewhere, I think there's plenty who have the knives out for Ramsey already and are stroking boners in anticipation of his failure. The biggest issue I think he's facing internally is maintaining discipline. If it becomes clear by Xmas that he can't command the players' respect then I guess you start asking questions. However cheerleading yet another managerial overthrow so soon will just make us look even more of a basketcase than we're already perceived to be.

Rewatching the QPR Player highlights, there was quite a lot to admire in those first 20 minutes.

There's a compilation of Coutinho's involvement in the Stoke game here, go on the and have a watch. He may not have been superb but he was - as always - far, far superior to Lallana, that much is irrefutable. 

As for the injuries excuse; he started over 33 games last season, took part in 41 or 42 in total. In other words, that's a lot of football, many other signings have come and not had that many chances (like Markovic).

And yes, he had a poor pre-season highlighted by two decent finishes and nothing else.

What makes you think he's our level then? I look at him and see a complete non-entity of a player, whose performances for nearly a year and a half mirror exactly that.

Next summer, when he moves on, he'll be looking at the likes of Palace, Villa, etc, he won't be that out of place then.

null,null,TC271,null,null,null,"&gt;You're always going to be able to find an economist to prove whatever position, unanimity isn't required.

And it appears the arguments between economists will never be resolved because economics is evidently not a science....perhaps this is way politicians have always being reluctant to identify themselves too closely with one particular school of economic thinking?

&gt;Austerity is widely discredited in academia, at least in terms of its benefit to the public at large, and Labour should have found a way to make that position palatable to the public.

Arguably those in academia who oppose the current form of austerity have being discredited themselves over the last few years (happens if you make doom laden predictions that don't come true) but yes I accept the point.

&gt;It is the duty of politicians to lead. That can mean informing and persuading the public to your point of view, not merely drifting with the currents. The Tories were highly successful in crafting a narrative of Labour causing the financial crisis (which in reality was bobbins)

I call strawman on that because I have never heard an official Conservative statement blaming the last Labour government for the sub prime crisis and I agree that any serious attempt to blame the UK government for it would be laughable.
The charge that can be correctly made is that the Blair/Brown governments ran deficits to recklessly expand public spending during periods of long term economic growth in the 00s that left us in the worse position of any major developed economy (I even include Japan) when the sub prime storm hit us - we are still paying the price.

&gt;This is another thing I'm criticising them for and exactly what is driving Corbyn's success. In the last 5 years they were an opposition without an alternative, fueling the public perception of them as ""Red Tories"". Why should people believe in an opposition that broadly agrees with the ruling party?

I find this amusing as ironically enough the coalition ended up broadly following Alastair Darlings macro economic plan..the truth is that Labour did not need a radically different economic plan to win the election (they did not have one when they won massive majorities in 1997 and 2001) they needed to present themselves as a competent government in waiting with a convincing leader and they utterly failed.

&gt;Rhetoric which stole the left entirely from Labour in Scotland. Again, an example of Labour failing to persuade people that they have anything to offer.

I am not sure if this is true - the test will be if Corbyn can revive labours chances in Scotland.

I really hope so, it's just encapsulated the entire farce around the club for a while. I also hope that he can get us close to that line of turning a profit, he did well at Burnley by all accounts, so that's a plus too. 

£6m for Gayle is insane money if it's true, glad we're not offering that much, seeing as we have spent a fair amount considering the league we're in as you say. 

The thing with consolidation is that it does seem there are a few different ideas floating around about what it is, and will only help to give Ramsey a harder time of it, with people using it to bash him. 

&gt; However cheerleading yet another managerial overthrow so soon will just make us look even more of a basketcase than we're already perceived to be.

McIntyre has pointed this out too, I think you're both right, but it does seem a lot of people have skipped a lot of the context about the club and expect an instant return to the premier league, which wouldn't be ideal even if we somehow made it.

Well, it doesn't make sense to you.  But that's hardly the test of a claim.  There are many ideas which, to their detractors, appear not to make any intuitive sense, (e.g. quantum theory, evolution), but that doesn't mean they are incorrect.

&gt;How can you have ideology-free evidence-based policy?

Use the scientific method.  That's how.

&gt;you can't use evidence to determine whose interests are the most important.

You can use reason and evidence together.  At any rate, this is the view of ['moral realists'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism).

null,null,sunnygovan,scottish,Govan,null,"&gt; Here in Germany, traffic lights are often staggered. Pedestrians get green first, then bikes two seconds later, then cars a couple of seconds after that. It means the more vulnerable road users get a chance to get on their way before being stampeded. It's safer that way. Some cyclists go through red lights shortly before they change for this reason. I don't condone it, but I do understand it.

Fair enough but he wasn't pre-empting it, he'd missed the green before he started filtering. Filtered to the front and kept on going.

&gt; I get this, actually... ...what you mean by ""thin bit"" either.

He was straddling the dividing line, I'd have been happy with it if he'd just taken the line a car would but he seemed to pick his moves to cause maximum delay for everyone else.

The thin bit is just a long section of road where it's difficult to overtake due to the thinness of the road.

&gt; Think about this for a second. Where is a cyclist most visible to you when you're in your car? In front, behind or to the sides?

&gt;In front, obviously. So logically it makes sense for the bike to go to the front of all the cars, because otherwise it's behind or to the side of at least somebody.

&gt;An exception is lorries, because they might not see you due to their cab being higher up.

Notable characteristics are the almost-square overall shape of the Ns and O. O is almost a perfect circle, but maybe not quite (hard to tell due to perspective/warp in the photo).

The S is the most distinct, with those serifs placed perpendicular on the end of the line. Find that S and you've probably got the right one.

The national heroes i was referring to didn't mass murder civilians, they didn't attack other countries, all they did was defend theirs from soviet aggression. Doing it in collaboration with the Wehrmacht doesn't make them any worse, since they aren't responsible (and most likely aware) for the Wehrmacths actions and crimes in other parts of Europe. They aren't nazis any more than partisants who aided the Red Army were ""bolsheviks"".

As for your first sentence, it betrays a belief the soviet union represents ""socialism"" and thus we are equating this with fascism. Which is a horrible lack of basic knowledge on the history of the USSR. It is to socialism what brutal gang-rape is to romantic, consentual sex. The bolsheviks wiped out far more people than the nazis and did it for a number of reasons, ranging from social and political to purely ethnic. In fact 78 years ago today [""Polish Operation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Operation_of_the_NKVD_%281937%E2%80%9338%29) of the NKVD started and resulted in execution of 111,091 ethnic Poles in the USSR to prevent any of them spying for Poland. The Volga Germans, the Romanians, Finns, Chuvash and many others were wiped out within the USSR on ethnic grounds, whilst entire nations deported like the Crimea Tatars. And you can't equate *this* with Fascism? Then i'd have to also be a pathetic individual and without even looking at your history guess you are a misguided socialist who has a bit more mellow view of the USSR just because it pretends to stand for left ideas you sympathise with. In reality the USSR is one of the worst monstrosities to have happened to history, along with the Third Reich, and both should be condemned.

If you're racing or at least trying to as fast as you can, sure. But if you're just going to the shops or whatever then no. You are actually far more likely to have a head injury whilst driving(or riding in) a car than riding a bike (provided you aren't mountain biking or racing) so if anyone should be wearing a helmet it should be those inside of the car.

You'll notice in places with decent cycling infrastructure barely anybody wears a helmet, see Amsterdam/Copenhagen because you really just don't need one

You have a funny way of interpreting what people say. I thought I made myself pretty clear in my replies.

Exactly. As I already said, I wasn't personally offended by the comment. You're obviously aware that people here do get very easily offended though. People take their national identity very seriously, hence the flags, riots, and all the merry piss that we have to wade through every day.

But 20 wins is the point where qualification odds move to the teams favor. Ever since there have been 4 Champions spots, teams with 19 wins make it to Champions 38% of the time, but just one more win means the team will have a 80% chance. http://imgur.com/wSQr9hI


Its also worth nothing that 80% at 20 is because Chelsea made it to Champions by winning the year before and knocking Spurs off. If I exclude that season, then its 100%.

Also Olivier has a good record against you and Walcott isn't that convincing as a striker playing alone. Sanchez? Really? Most of the people were surprised he was even on the bench, because he just came back from holidays. He trained with the team for like 3 days I think and he was there only ""in case"", and that case happened so he came in on the pitch, but you could've clearly see he isn't ready yet, he was just slow, he needs another 2 or 3 weeks of preparation imo. The plan was good, but it was horribly executed, as you could see from Wenger anger (there are rumours he locked players for 45 minutes after the game). Even though Arsenal played poorly and West Ham was very mature we lost mostly because of Cech mistakes, both goals are mostly his fault, even though defenders didn't do great he still should've saved that any day of the week. I blame him and the midfield for no creativity, Ramsey was very annoying, Ozil too static for himself, Coquelin is a DM so it's not his job (but he shouldn't have lost the ball those few times) and Cazorla was playing a little bit deeper. But actually no one except Cech played horribly bad and no one played well except for Ox, who imo was looking very well, he was looking sharp. But back to the topic - Wenger said he expected West Ham to be a very tough opponent as he was convinced you guys are better prepared for the season right now.

It's a shame, really, if you're gonna be a supporter, have your opinion but ffs stop coming to the conclusion that you know better than Rodgers because you don't. 

Lovren had one shit year, plenty of time to solve himself out and he did AND he's still getting stick for it. People were unsatisfied with a 1-0 win.... away at Stoke, what did you want a 3-0?????????

I for one, saw something different in the team on Sunday. Playing for each other, everyone was doing their jobs, especially on the defensive end. FFS we looked more physically imposing than Stoke and that's something that was missing from our game last year. IT was one game, we had some poor connections but in all honesty, what happened in this first game against Stoke gets me more excited about what happens the rest of the season. 

Liverpool looked like they wanted to win. Fuck Arsenal lost to West Ham at home and are getting less criticism from their fans. Like just give this team time ffs. Who knows if Lucas is staying or not? You're daft if you think Rodgers is going to sell Sakho or Moreno now. And Lucas just isn't the same player anymore and we all know that. Yes he can win you the physical battles and sort out the defense of the midfield but you give Milner and Can those deep lying roles and they'll succeed as well.

She grew up really very poor in the Irish part of St Helens, jokes that she didn't hear an English accent until she went to school. Now she's the epitome of intellectual middle class, a Phd, married to a nice middle class boy from down south who moved to Liverpool to study medicine because he loved the Beatles. 

Either way she comes at it, the tattoo moves her on a viscerally cultural level. She understood it was up and down snobbishness but she found she couldn't quite escape how deeply ingrained a signpost of negativity it was. It marked me, in her mind, for a diffrent path. No nice girl wants a man with a tattoo. 

It also hit a nerve about self harm, not me, or her, but something she had dealt with before. Trying to explain that the pain wasn't the point, but the price, that it wasn't any diffrent to her legs aching after a walk in the lake district an ineffective intellectual answer to an emotional problem.      

Point of all this? My mother is not stupid or vindictive but she is a product of the place and times she was raised. She went through a lot of the same things this woman did, unable to stop herself even when she knew it was silly. 

All of this is the result of the fact that it's one of the few things we have a fundamentally diffrent understanding of. One place in which I don't think we'll ever find common ground because we've lived in a totally diffrent frame of reference. In her experience she is right, just like I am in mine, it can make for a painful disconnect. It was oddly worse than when I gave up on being Catholic or even religious.   

Fundamentally my mother is wrong but in a way I can understand. Shouldn't, and don't, have to think about how my mother will feel about my tattoos but I think some people don't realise just how diffrent things where even 20 years ago.

As far as I am concerned - passing a cyclist is a 'hazardous manoevre', so it should only be attempted if absolutely necessary to make reasonable progress. A lot of people see a cyclist and simply see an obstruction and endeavor to get past as quickly as possible. But given the potential danger involved, it is best to first analyze the traffic situation ahead. It's pointless to perform an overtaking manoevre if you have to stop for a queue in 200 yards.

A lot of people worry about their own journey first and consider safety a secondary priority (but are quite happy to moan all over facebook about that one time a minicab was stopped on double yellows). Look at the way some people interact with buses or lorries - it's the same thing.

Also, some people assume that it's OK to pass with the same clearance at 20mph as it is at 40mph. It just isn't. 

I think 5 years worth of taxi driving has given me a good picture of how people behave in urban traffic, and you're quite right in your confusion between common-sense principles and what people actually do.

Also, while it's true Mozart's first work was somewhat ""derivative"" (yes, well done), they were written from the age of five!

&gt;New knowledge is only possible because of the giants that came before us.

And how do we share this knowledge with the next generation. IN SCHOOL!

&gt;Lest we forget, the China we know today is a new country. 

No, it's not. It's thousands of years with traditions still fermenting to this day, which goes a long way in exposing how degenerative China's education is.

&gt;As of 2011 the Chinese have have been publishing around 10% of all scientific papers in the world. Second only to US.

Nope. No, they have not. You're actually quoting from a 2011 Royal Society report in which it was *predicted* that China will overtake the US ""*sometime before 2020.*""

But that's beside the point. Here's the thing: can you name one Western peer-reviewed journal that has carried any Chinese scientific paper? No?

That's because the same Royal Society report measured the quality of papers from the China, US and the UK. That is, by measuring the citations in all papers. In this, the US was in the lead, with the UK second and China bottom of league with [virtually zero citations](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/28/china-us-publisher-scientific-papers).

And this probably explains why-

&gt;If half of those are plagiarised, or even 75%, you have to admit that it's not bad for a country that didn't publish anything before the 1980s.

Actually, that is bad. Horrifically bad. But then, this is to be expected from a country where the government owns all of the academic journals and all books do not even have indexes or bibliographies.

And while, yes, there have been substantial advances and growth in lowering material costs and eroding some of the poverty line in areas of your country, I'll leave you with one final question to further prove my point:

How is it you can agree with everything I've said, yet come to a different conclusion??

EDIT: You do realize that link to the Independent article doesn't even uphold anything you say? It's a study on the emotions *from* the act of cheating, which anyone can tell is also known as an ""adrenaline rush"" and doesn't go to any way in determining your argument.

I am now very liberal with taking primary position, and would recommend that all other cyclists do the same. If you're approaching a narrow bit of road and want to discourage a car from attempting to overtake, get into the centre of the road (in a safe manner, obviously) and make them treat you like a car.

null,null,MICOTINATE,null,null,null,"Strength is an issue, I'm hoping Reed is one of those short guys with unexpected strength on the ball sometimes a low centre of gravity is an advantage against the likes of Toure.

My biggest concern is that in Schneiderlin we've lost the brains of the midfield. Koeman has us playing with more or less 4 forwards, and while they do track back fairly diligently the wingers just don't provide enough defensive cover because they're usually so caught up in the attack. On top of that the full backs are both joining the attack at every opportunity, so it was Wanyama and Schneiderlin who would slow down any counter attack long enough for the rest of the team to get back. 

That was Schneiderlin's biggest asset for us and it usually just boiled down to standing in the right place or taking the right running line so that counter attacking players would run with the ball instead of playing a killer pass. I don't think Wanyama can properly compensate for that positional awareness alone and I think Clasie and Davis are too attacking to get it right either.

I'm just worried that the game against Newcastle with all the helter-skelter back and forth and us looking particularly fragile and exposed for 10 seconds every time we lose possession is a taste of what's to come if we continue with the same style without a decent Schneiderlin replacement. However good Clasie's other attributes are if that 2 man defensive shield isn't right we'll be constantly over-exposing ourselves.

To be honest the game reminded me whole lot of when Adkins was in charge in the PL, right down to how Fonte and Yoshida seemed to have regressed 2 seasons (which I put down to how isolated they kept getting).

some starting points may be looking at periods of time you would like to look at? maybe 19th century literature, or like how language has changed in a period of time?or you could go down another route and maybe look at the use of language in modern day/historical media/advertising?

to choose my question knew i wanted to do older-type history, and preferably i wanted to look at british invasions - one of my original questions was ""how did the invasions of britain shape its history"", and i was going to look at roman, viking and norman invasions but it was simply too broad, so i narrowed down to vikings in a specific period of time.

so basically don't worry about narrowing it down completely at the initial stages - just a general idea and general research helps at the beginning then you can discuss with your supervisor and see what really grabs your attention!

At present Wanyama seems to have been given a bit of a more forward role which keeps confusing me. Seeing Clasie dropping between the two CB's in the friendlies and vs Vitesse, and occasionally hearing about S. Davis doing the mopping up instead of Wanyama was interesting.  

I am still of the opinion 5 at the back would be our best bet. The 3 CB's would give a lot more freedom to the wide players, also allow Wanyama to get this slightly more forward role he seems keen to take up, while still being a wall, and allows for the 2 man partnership up front that benefits Pelle so well.

null,null,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,null,"&gt; You're saying it's ok for cyclists to hog a road which was ultimately made for cars and cycle along the whole width and covering a length of 200 feet, preventing anyone from overtaking.

Yes. And the road is not made for cars, it's made for vehicles. Just because it isn't safe to overtake doesn't mean they are preventing you from overtaking. If the motorway is full of traffic do you start screaming at all the other motorists for not getting out of your way? If there are lorries on the road and you can't pass, do you start bitching about them? Judging by your attitude, you probably do. Again, it's your job to make sure it is safe to pass, not the person in front.

&gt;And then you get to call the drivers cunts for complaining. Maybe it's time to get cyclists to pay a road tax too, if that's actually the case.

It is quite cuntish to think the road was made for you. Nobody pays road tax, nobody has paid road tax since 1937, we now have emissions tax. Bicycles happen to have zero emissions.

&gt;And by the way, I also cycle (mostly to and from work), and I actually respect other users of the roads.

Why does every driver who knows nothing about cycling always say this when they are trying to argue a point they don't know about? ""I actually cycle too and I always move out of the way of cars because that's what cyclists should do!""

&gt;I have had this discussion loads of times in the past, and have come to the realisation that trying to actually have a conversation with ubercyclists is pointless, they simply don't give a fuck about other vehicles and the people in them - yet complain when things get dangerous.

Think about what you are saying, you want other road users to get out of your way because you think you are more important than them. You are so disconnected from the reality of the situation here.

EDIT: also, roads were made for horses and carts and bicycles, cars were still a few years away when roads came about.

What you weren't prepared for was the entirety of our squad shifting back to defense when we lost the ball.  Giroud is the only person you have that comes close to our back line in height -- so having him as a lone target man was never going to do you any favors, and you weren't going to get through on the ground when we shifted to a 4-5-1 defensively.

I'll concede your point about Sanchez -- but if that's his contingency plan (an arguably unfit player who just came back from holiday), then that's poor planning from Wenger no matter how you slice it.  Either find somebody else to fill that role -- internally or transfer them in -- or change tactics.

You're delusional if you blame both of our goals on Cech though.  The first one, from Payet's freekick?  Absolutely his fault, he should have marshalled his defenders better.

The second one though?  You guys had five defenders just sitting there, watching Zarate wheel around.  Not ONE of them even attempted to close him down or apply pressure.  One guy tried to cut off his shot line, but he wasn't moving like he gave a shit.  I'd put that on them before I put it on Cech.

I also think you missed the plot with looking at your own squad. Ox-Cham WAS the only person on your squad who offered any kind of threat -- but the rest of your players were mediocre at BEST.  Payet cost us 25% of what you paid for Ozil.  You should expect consistency from him for that price tag.

You also had no answer about your squad's positional discipline -- but that's been a weak point for Wenger for who knows how long, so it's beating a dead horse.

The greatest trick the pro-austerity politicians ever played was convincing the public that you run the country's finances like you run your own. You don't. It's natural for governments to have a certain amount of debt. In fact, it's actually quite healthy. It's how you use that debt that's important. If your GDP continues to grow (which it will with sensible investment), your debts become a smaller percentage of the overall pie. 

Conversely, if you have a government which decides on austerity, you reduce the amount of money in the private economy and, consequently, you restrict growth. This is, in turn, bad for the government in the long run, as it reduces tax receipts. 

Edit: Indeed, it's not even as if we run our own personal lives debt free. Most homeowners will have mortgages, for instance. How else could they afford a house?

&gt; Adama is an out-and-out winger who loves to dominate the flanks, dribble through the defences and make pacy runs that result in goals.

&gt; He fits perfectly into 4-3-3/ 3-4-3 style of play where wingers need to stretch the defence of the opposition. He rarely cuts inside but dictates the play through the wings with his skills. Adama’s playing style resembles that of Arjen Robben, except for the fact that he has a lot more to do to reach that level.

&gt; His strengths lie in his innate ability to make dangerous dribbles and whizz past defenders like a bullet. His crosses are always pin-point &amp; a goal threat. He is versatile and can draw away defenders, creating spaces in middle.

&gt; His ability to take long shots gives him an edge in his attacking style of play. Adama is physically strong and well built and doesn’t go down in spite of being the victim of reckless challenges, which make him even more threatening as a player.

&gt; However, Adama is hardly a team player and tries to do all things by himself. He lacks the positional awareness and intelligence to pick out incisive passes which make him a little ineffective in team play. 

&gt; Once he develops passing intelligence and the ability to play within a team, like his idol, Lionel Messi, there is no doubt that he’ll be the future star of European football.

Before Liverpool’s cathartic 1-0 victory over Stoke City on Sunday, Brendan Rodgers was asked if he remained in complete command of the club he manages despite the pressure he has come under. Although he answered in the affirmative, it was only when the Northern Irishman delivered his first team sheet of the season that his response became emphatic.

After a summer in which he had to survive a stern post-season review, it is becoming clear that, rather than having his wings clipped by Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Liverpool’s owners, Rodgers feels sufficiently empowered to do things his way, without compromise. The team that took to the field at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday highlighted this bold approach as it showed that, whether Rodgers succeeds or fails, he will be doing so on his own terms.

By choosing Nathaniel Clyne, Dejan Lovren, James Milner, Adam Lallana and Christian Benteke — players that he identified and convinced his employers to sign — and overlooking players such as Mamadou Sakho, Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Divock Origi, who arrived via the committee system installed by FSG, Rodgers removed any lingering doubts about his authority. This is his team and his way.

Victory afforded Rodgers an early vindication, even if it was secured by a typically outstanding goal from Philippe Coutinho, the most successful of Liverpool’s committee signings. No matter how determined he is to be master of his own destiny, he will not ignore a talent such as Coutinho or Roberto Firmino just to prove a point.
But while what is occurring is not a power struggle, it is a refinement of the club’s modus operandi as they attempt to remove many of the grey areas that clouded everything from team selection to performance assessment last season, a campaign that ended with neither manager nor committee happy with the manner in which a complex transfer strategy had been implemented.

Although players had not been signed against the manager’s will, there were instances when he had to accept that internal politics meant that he could not always get his first choice. Equally, there was a feeling within the club that Rodgers could have made better use of his new arrivals.

Having been permitted to replace his coaching staff, Rodgers’s team selection away to Stoke was among the most significant of his tenure. **For those left out, particularly Sakho, Moreno and Lucas Leiva, omission has created uncertainty. With three weeks to go until the transfer window closes, all three have discovered that they are not first choice. How they react to this will determine whether they stay or go.**

**While Rodgers was able to use the cover of Sakho becoming a father last week to explain his absence, the defender had made himself available and travelled with the Liverpool squad for Sunday’s match.**
Given that Jordan Henderson was picked in an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Blackburn Rovers in April despite enduring a sleepless night after attending the birth of his second child, the suggestion that Sakho was spared on compassionate grounds rather than being overlooked in favour of Lovren begins to wilt under scrutiny.

For Lucas, who did not travel to Stoke, the message is clear — his time at Liverpool is almost up. The combination of the deterioration in his relationship with Rodgers and his manager’s tactical approach has made the Brazilian surplus to requirements, regardless of his status as Liverpool’s longest-serving player. Moreno will know that the selection at left back of Joe Gomez, an 18-year-old centre half, is hardly a ringing endorsement of himself.

But whether aggrieved at omission or relieved at selection, every member of the Liverpool squad will share one common belief — that Rodgers is not only calling the shots, but he is also doing so from a position of increased strength and with a renewed conviction about how he intends to manage.",null,0,null,1439308002,null,null,false,0,ctz8luh,null,t3_3glrq0,null,null,null,t3_3glrq0,null,null,null,1440414916,null,38,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,38,null

null,null,Where_s_Johhny_2,newcr-5,,null,"Watched a lot of Leverkusen last year. Few things that may work in our favor: 

1.) Leverkusen came in fourth in the BuLi meaning they have to win out in the play-off round to even make the group stage. Isn't to say they won't, but their CL spot is far from assured. Also, as the Ayew, Shaqiri, Payet and Wijnaldum transfers seem to indicate, playing in the PL is appealing to young talent regardless of club reputation. 

2.) Cal had some injuries last season, yet when fit he was given sporadic minutes. We all saw the set-piece highlights, however it was rare for him to go a full 90 and not uncommon to only see him play every other game. Not sure how happy he was with this - certain times his body language as he was subbed off appeared less than pleased. 

3.) Castro is gone but Aranguiz, Mehmedi and Milik (back from loan) are in - all of them could conceivably compete for the spot behind Keißling. Personally, I think Mehmedi ultimately will get the nod to start. 

4.) Cal's got a history of diva antics. He's essentially fourth or fifth fiddle at Leverkusen behind Bellarabi, Son, Keißling, possibly Brandt and most likely Mehmedi. Coming to Everton, he'd become the offensive focal point, which along with the PL prestige, could sway him our way.

Not sure if this is even in the realm of Bobby's consciousness, but I'd certainly welcome the move if it came to fruition. Extremely dynamic talent with creativity, pin-point accuracy and a bit of attitude, all things we desperately need to shake off the monotony carrying over from last season.

No I'm not. 

If I'm on the highway and a slow driver is on the fast lane and not moving, they are in the wrong. 

If you are in a slow vehicle IT IS ALSO YOUR JOB to ensure your safety and the safety of others. 

I have never claimed to not want cyclists, or slow drivers, or tractors, on the roads. I simply claim that if cyclists expect drivers to be careful and courteous, the return is also true.  

What YOU are telling ME is that if you want to go at 30 on a 70 road without giving even the possibility of overtaking to those behind you, that is your right and privilege. 

Most of my encounters with cyclists have been fine, some have been shit due to a lack of courtesy on their part, including with you, even just on reddit. But, you know, sometimes people are just annoying pedants such as yourself. It can't be helped, it's why we can't have nice things.

Afterall, any official name for a place should surely derive from what the people who live there actually call it. That's a separate issue though.

The fact is that McClean identifies as Irish and from Derry. To intentionally contradict that, even if the whole thing is a stupid headache, is to disrespect how a an individual self-identifies. This is just my opinion, but I believe that a person's identity, be it their name, nationality, gender ect, should be entirely their own choice. I think Parry intentionally contradicted that and he was wrong to do so.

I don't believe McClean intentionally tried to offend when he refused to wear the poppy or stand to attention for God Save The Queen. I think he just did that for himself.

* Scarborough/Whitby/Robin Hood's Bay area for a mix of coastal towns/villages which can be combined with a trip over the North York Moors (which has a nice old steam engine iirc)
* Market towns in the west of the region - Masham, Ripon, Knaresborough and Skipton (both also have castles) etc.
* Incredible scenery in the Yorkshire Dales (unlike any I've seen elsewhere) - Malham, Brimham rocks, Aysgarth, Hawes etc. (and they're just the tourist traps, there are many less spoilt)
* Interesting places with a more recent history - Saltaire (in the north of Bradford) is an 'industrial village'. The West and South Yorkshire regions are most famous for their part in the Industrial Revolution. Also Bronte stuff.
* Harrogate, if you like that kind of thing. I really don't, but many do.

* A net income of £1,100 is fairly low - suggests a gross salary of around £14,500. 50 hours a week x minimum wage x 48 weeks a year = £15,600. Therefore, you should maybe try to look to build that income elsewhere if possible.

Cyclists aren't allowed on the motorway. A cyclist is never going to be in the fast lane, ever, so your entire point here is meaningless.

Yes, by staying in my lane and checking my surroundings before manoeuvring, not by moving out of the way of the impatient person behind me. 

It is ALWAYS YOUR JOB to pass when it is safe. It is NEVER MY JOB to make sure it is safe for you to pass. 100% of the responsibility is on you here.

&gt;I have never claimed to not want cyclists, or slow drivers, or tractors, on the roads. I simply claim that if cyclists expect drivers to be careful and courteous, the return is also true.

You don't want courtesy, you want people to move out of your way because you think you have more right to be there.

&gt;Most of my encounters with cyclists have been fine, some have been shit due to a lack of moving out of my way on their part.

FTFY.

No

You keep using council and housing association interchangeably - they're not the same so depending on which it is the situation might be different.

You're not liable for any arrears unless you are on the tenancy agreement.

Generally speaking social landlords are not required to find somewhere for lodgers of our tenants to live when the tenant is evicted. You will most likely have to go through the council/housing associations allocations scheme if you want another property and it's unlikely to be quick as a single person with no children or disabilities.

The signs advertising the flats to rent are not necessarily owned by the council/housing association. If it's a council block they're likely to have been bought through right to buy and are now owned privately. If it's a housing association then there is a possibility they are available to let but if you were in social housing before they may be 'affordable' (usually 80% of market) or full market rent.",null,0,null,1439309352,null,null,1439309647,0,ctz9hx2,null,t3_3gkah8,null,null,null,t3_3gkah8,null,null,null,1440415336,null,1,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

null,null,che_jrz28,null,null,null,"I understand why Rodgers feels so adamant to prove his signings worth. He wants to be largely in control of the team and feel that the successes of the club are due to his vision and tactical acumen. What I don't agree with is the way he goes about it, i.e., freezing out and isolating players who don't fit into HIS plans. This comes with the unfortunate effect of leaving out players who—although might not be beneficial to HIS plans—could be very beenficial to the well-being of the team. We saw the great run we went on last year while Lucas was on the side. We've all witnessed how Lovren has cost us points at the expense of having a more capable defender (Sakho) on the bench.

Moreover, his approach also alienates players from the squad in a way that I find unfair. It creates a climate of tension and disaccord between players and manager that could adversely affect the opinions potential transfer targets have of working with Brendan. Reina and him ended up on poor terms; Lucas is seemingly on the same path. There are questions looming about Brendan's relationship with Mamadou. Even though a large portion of the blame rests on Balotelli's shoulder's, I still feel he has has been treated very harshly and unprofessionally by Rodgers. 

So I understand why he wants to strongly assert his influence over the squad, I just think the way he does it is at times detrimental.

Let me be clear: I don't like the SNP as a party and I don't like the system of devolved government. Two separate issues.

I would not vote for a candidate who belonged to a party that would do a deal with separatists or a party I particularly disliked. This is similar to some voters who would not vote Lib Dem because they teamed up with the Tories. Note that this is about the SNP, not Scottish MPs - when I used 'your' in my original comment I was taking a gamble that you lived in an SNP seat (pretty good odds tbh).

The second issue *is* about Scottish MPs. All of them. They shouldn't be allowed to vote on English-only matters. This includes when Scottish Labour voted for fees for English students.

Not mentioned is industrial action short of a strike such as an overtime ban. It's quite sad how Boris ""I promise not to close ticket stations"" Johnson is seen as a mad eccentric but the late Bob Crow was a figure of hate and out for himself at the cost of Londoners (recall that Britain is only London).

That sort of cherry-picking goes both ways, someone can say its not correct to say that we will never make champions with as little as 16 wins and someone else will reply, well thats not true, look at Liverpool in 2003-2004. There will always be outliers on the extremes edges.

All I said is 20 wins puts us in the hunt. I think that's an accurate statement. I didn't say it guarantees us a place in Champions. I didn't say its impossible to make it to Champions with less wins.  I didn't say we shouldn't aim any higher. I said at 20 we can start getting our hopes up.

null,null,guilty_by_design,cnty-expat,Wurzel in NJ - Ooh arr!,null,"One of the reasons I expatriated myself to the US was because of the lack of decent health care provisions in the UK for mental illness. Access to therapy and psychiatric medication consultations* are almost impossible, with waiting lists upwards of 6 months even for basic DBT... and then untreated mentally ill people can't even get financial assistance or workplace support while they wait.

Since moving to the US, I've managed to get 6 months DBT therapy for $20 per week, compared to the impossible £200 per week I was looking at paying back in the UK if I didn't want to wait upwards of 6 months to start. 

Support for mentally ill people actively seeking work was also piss poor when I was living back home. Bad enough not being able to get any decent amount of liveable support whilst unemployed, but trying to get assistance and advocacy whilst job hunting is impossible too. Won't support you if you're unemployed due to mental illness. Won't support you trying to get work, either. Mentally ill people aren't even on the radar.

My mother, a single mum, struggled to make ends meet sometimes. But I'm incredibly fortunate that I've never been dirt poor nor homeless. I had the option to move abroad when the opportunity arose. The UK treats its mentally ill and its poor people like crap.

God, I love England and I miss it every day, and I will probably come running home with my tail between my legs if Donald Trump gets the GOP nomination over here, but... it is not a good place to be if you're mentally ill.

You add 10 points instead of the nothing we got that season and suddenly we're potentially ahead of Arsenal if they were one of the teams we didn't lose to.

13/14... if we'd picked up just THREE more points (that's literally 1 win against these guys, or 3 draws of course, or if we'd just drawn City away we'd have been tied on points but lost on GD) from those fixtures then we'd have won the league.

Then last season, we were 8 points off United.  If you add those 10 points again then we're in 4th place.  If you only add those 8 points then we're still ahead of United if we took even 1 point off of them in that adjustment.

It's a fucking huge deal to lose to the teams you're directly fighting for a spot with and it's made a massive impact on each of our last 3 seasons.  Obviously we dropped a bunch of really stupid points to teams we should have beaten too, but there's no way you can say that only getting 4 points from any run of 7 teams, let alone the ones we're in direct competition with (which means by taking points we're outright denying them points too).",null,0,null,1439310680,null,null,false,0,ctzadhl,null,t3_3gldfi,null,null,null,t1_ctz6y0u,null,null,null,1440415749,null,5,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

I (apparently unlike many readers of this sub) have enjoyed all of the New Who companions. All of them have had great character arcs, with the possible exception of Clara, whose story has been a bit of a mess. Of course, it's not over yet, so Moffat may pull a rabbit out of a hat and give us a pretty bow with which to tie it all up.   
Donna and Amy, in particular, both started out selfish, immature and bossy, and both evolved into incredible women. I would be proud to be likened to either of them near the end of the respective journeys.     
Rory's kind heart and devotion to his love, plus his ability to surmount his fear and meet any challenge, made him another personal favorite.

&gt; The chance that I will be seriously hurt on a bicycle is not that much greater than the chance that I will be seriously hurt as a pedestrian.

&gt; It is greater, but not so much more that I should start wearing a silly helmet. If you look at the body of work that's been done, the benefits of helmets are highly dubious and controversial. If there was a clear benefit it would have been seen by now. 

&gt; If you are going to wear a helmet for cycling, the risk of injury you are shielding yourself from is not very different from that which you would protect yourself from if you wore a helmet while walking.

&gt; Plus, simply the idea that a helmet is required for cycling will discourage people from taking it up - and so increase deaths from heart disease.

Yes, Labour has more often than not been led by the moderate wing of the party.  That makes sense, given the way Labour operates, its broad church, its platform for achievable change.  But that makes it no less the party of the Bennites, or Blue Labour, or anything like that/

Sure, the _relative_ centre of the party tends to run the party.  (I wouldn't necessarily line Blair, Attlee, Wilson etc. up and say they were all the same brand of centrism—certainly Blair is a product of the political consensus shifting right to _make_ him the centre.)  I can't speak for every single year of Labour's existence, but right now it is my understanding that the leader is democratically elected, the NPF and NEC elected, MPs are selected with some degree of internal democracy, etc. etc.  (and I imagine this has been the case for most of Labour's existence, but feel free to give me a history lesson if I'm wrong).  That means that the power structures of the party are to some degree accountable to and acting on behalf of the party members.  It doesn't, or shouldn't, mean they _own_ the party (except in the most ludicrously literal sense), that they have the sole right to consider themselves Labour and all the fringe groups are just entryists, reactionaries, etc. they haven't booted out yet.

If Corbyn gets in, then the central column might start steering in another direction.  Does that make Liz Kendall stop having Labour values?  No.  Does that mean the Corbynites get to say who is and who isn't ‘real Labour’?  I gosh darn hope not.  Will I start baying for the blood of everyone who posted hatchet jobs on him in the weeks running up to the election?  Of course not.

This belief that because the central power has always been moderate anyone who isn't moderate is somehow denied from being a legitimate stakeholder in Labour really irks me.  We should be open to debate and the _possibility_ of change.  What's happening with Corbyn suggests that a lot of the party are ready for some, and what's happening with the riposte has stopped being sensible debate and started being hysterical power-play.  I certainly never joined this party to be told ‘sorry, you're too left to have any meaningful stake in this party, move along’.",null,0,null,1439313130,null,null,false,0,ctzc1vh,null,t3_3gkmyq,null,null,null,t1_ctza3bc,null,null,null,1440416605,null,5,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,5,null

For places to stay, google ""kent b&amp;b"" and you can choose from the locations on a map. Create your itinerary of attractions, and then choose a B&amp;B near the place you'll be visiting that day. Avoid major roads and go through the small villages, you'll see a lot of pretty places, including ""cottages"" on the way. You can have lunch in ""pubs"" on the way, or buy sandwiches from supermarkets. 

If you're coming from Dover, then an hour away is Bodiam Castle. You only need half a day for that, it looks like a picture from a fairytale book. 
http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bodiam-castle/

Next day you can visit Hever Castle,

for which you need a full day. It has a large park which looks good in all seasons, a lake, and you can go inside the castle as well and learn a lot about the Tudors and one of the most famous English kings, Henry VIII. That would be the best ""garden"" you can see in November... 
 
Spent the next day in the town of Rochester, which has even two castles and nice places to eat, you'll also see some houses from the novels of Charles Dickens. 

Next day go to the town of Canterbury and see the grand cathedral there. Check the opening times for the day you visit though,

null,null,tet-,newcr-1,,null,"**Howard** - Average. He had no chance with the first goal, perhaps a good save would have prevented the second.

**Coleman** - Looks to get worse everytime I see him. Always forced inside now, which is probably down to Bobby, so you never see him bomb on anymore.

**Stones** - Our standout performer in the first half - at fault for the second goal.

**Jags** - Nothing amazing but did his job.

**Galloway** - Pretty solid debut defensively, but you can clearly see he's a centre half when it turns into an attacking phase.

**Barry** - Did well at left-back and to be fair, didn't really do a lot wrong.

**McCarthy** - Not his best game, but we can forgive him.

**Cleverley** - I actually like the guy. Getting a lot of hate for some reason, lets give him a chance.

**Barkley** - Once he settled into the game, he did good. We need someone in that position who is going to bomb on though like a Lampard. Barkley always wants to have it on the edge of the box so he can hit a spectacular.

**Mirallas** - Our only real threat in the first half.

**Lukaku** - He was poor but I really can't get on his back about it. We fail to play to his strengths. We know he can't play with his back to goal so why do we force him to do it?

**Kone** - Brilliant game from him. Lets see if he can kick on.

**Oviedo** - Was slightly confused when I saw him coming on. Has he even played pre season? Looked like he wanted to make something happen but its quite depressing when he's the guy coming on to make something happen.

*""Oh, he's not good straight away playing his first game, for a new team, with people he's never played with, in a country he's been in for literally days. He must be shit I hate him!""*    

What has money got to do with it? Players from the Dutch league are often cheaper than players from England or Spain, as those leagues are hugely overpriced. Why do you think it's a good idea to spend more money on a player than less? Clasie has played at a high level for years and has appeared in the world cup for Holland. The money we paid for him is a steal.

The club philosophy is also to buy young, promising players and develop them to their full potential. Something that the club has proved they can do and it has been very successful. We're not Sunderland or Stoke, buying has beens and rejects for huge wages. Do you know better than the people at the club, whose job it is to bring players in?  

Also, it's spelled Schneiderlin.

I'm starting a new job in a week, so once I have all my debts sorted out I'll be wanting a decent machine to replace the elderly workhorse that I lost to a fire.

I'm probably going to have a budget of around £500 - £600, depending on whether or not I get put on the right tax code immediately. So, I'd like to get some prices for the following:

* A full or mid ATX motherboard
* An i5, but preferably an i7 CPU - probably an older one for this budget
* Mid-range DDR3 (DDR4 would be nice, but it's costly)
* A banging GPU. I'd give around a third of the total budget for this.
* An AIO cooling solution for the CPU - I'd like a double length, but a single length thicker rad would be sufficient
* A bundle of fans. Noise is irrelevant to me, although air throughput is a consideration factor.
* A decent power supply. I'm hoping for above 850W, silver standard will suffice.

I've been out of the new hardware game for a couple of years now, so if this budget is a ridiculous one I apologise. Also, I plan on getting a particular Lian-Li case that sits flat as opposed to a tower style - hence why a case is not included here.

Of course it inconveniences people, that's part of the risk of going on strike and one of the reasons unions use strikes as a last resort (that and losing a days pay). But instead of complaining about how the tube strike is inconveniencing you just think how about how much worse your life would be if unions hadn't taken similar action in the past.

If more people were as willing to stand up to their employers as the RMT then we'd all be a lot better off.

You honestly saying you can't make out a moving shape the size of a truck a kilometer away? You're fucking blind then, thank fuck you don't drive.

&gt; Who says I haven't driven along a straight country road?

You do with your every utterance.

&gt; I have driven along plenty of straight roads, but why would people have trouble passing a lorry on a straight road? Your argument doesn't add up. You're saying lorries pull off to let people past, while on straight roads at least 3/4 of a mile long where they could have passed anyway?

If you drove you would know oncoming traffic is a thing. On country roads there can often be long periods of time where overtaking simply isn't possible.

&gt; not to mention the fact that lorries go 56mph, why would you even need to pass a lorry on a 60mph road like this?

All lorries go 56 do they? All the time as well? Again you prove you've never really driven.

I would have thought that it might well have prevented the Dimension Cannon from working too, if the Dimension Retroclosure didn't already do that – although in the recent Twelfth Doctor comic, a similar UNIT technology allowed a UNIT scientist to reach this universe from another parallel, and that certainly was post-BB2.

You don't, but you need to have top 4 money to be able to sign the players that push you into that level of quality.

Outside of the top-6 I will be hard-pressed to find a single player that would substantially improve our starting XI.

For Baldini, to enable Spurs to sign what was then a regular for Spain (arguably, at the time, one of the best teams on the planet),  shows great skill as a technical director.

We could have signed Benteke...but there is just as big a chance he will flop at Liverpool as Soldado flopping for us. Sid Lowe and Tor-Kristian Karlsen of the Guardian both hailed the Soldado signing at the time. Sid Lowe even going as far as saying the only guarantee of Soldado is lots of goals.

It is NOT paid for by your contributions over the years. That is a PRIVATE pension, and purely optional.

NI contributions go towards all benefits. And although you can opt to pay extra into your own pension (Class 3: voluntary contributions), that does not mean that all money goes into your own pension.

null,null,justthisplease,null,null,null,"QE did not cause inflation in the real economy only in asset prices which made the rich richer, QE that Corbyn is promoting may cause inflation or may not;

""The QTM posits that an expansion of the money supply causes inflation because it adds nominal spending growth to a fully employed economy.
The only way the economy could adjust to more spending when it was already at full capacity was to ration that spending off with higher prices. Financial commentators simplify this and say that inflation arises when there is ‘too much money chasing too few goods’.
The main problem with the theory (there are several) is that capitalist economies are rarely operating at full employment. The Classical theory essentially denied the possibility of unemployment.
The fact that economies typically operate with spare productive capacity and often with persistently high rates of unemployment, means that it is hard to maintain the view that there is no scope for firms to expand the supply of real goods and services when there is an increase in total spending growth. If a firm has poor sales and lots of spare productive capacity, why would it hike prices when sales improved?
Thus, if there was an increase in availability of credit and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services, it is likely that firms with excess capacity will respond by increasing the supply of goods and services to maintain or increase market share rather than push up prices.
In other words, an evaluation of the inflationary consequences of OMF should be made with reference to the state of the economy.
If there is idle capacity then it is most unlikely that OMF will be inflationary. At some point, when unemployment is low and firms are operating at close to or at full capacity, then any further spending, whether funded by OMF or some other scheme, will likely introduce an inflationary risk into the policy deliberations.""

It's a god damn tattoo, it isn't a mortage, bank loan, credit card, getting some bird pregnant, which imo need to be discussed with people who are a bit wiser.

He got it on an inconspicuous place on his body, some interviewer isn't going to ask him to take his shirt off and inspect his body, it won't have any effect on his job prospects and education, I'm sure he'll survive.

The likelihood is that, in the long run, he'll regret his decision. Tattoos are a fashion item at the moment. They're going through a popular phase. But that won't last. They'll become passée because even complete losers will be getting them (this is already happening) to try and look 'cool'.

Tattoos have been going on for hundreds of years, they're not going to be ""passée"" or yesterday's fad.

&gt;**A lot of people I know have tattoos**. Most of them are shit. Classics include band names (because a t-shirt wasn't good enough?), tribal designs that look like they were done by a two year old, and stupidly over the top chest tattoos. In 10 years time, I imagine the people who got them will be wondering why they did. And if they don't wonder that, that's not much better...

You'd stand a better chance with cup/midweek games if you waited for a general sale, but its best to heed the above advice and get a membership. 

I don't actually own a membership, but I believe they guarantee you at least a few games per season(?). I know that when I inform the club that I won't be using my season ticket for a game, it goes straight to the members for first dibs, and it has always been sold, even if I've pulled out a few hours before kick off. So I'm assuming that beggars can't be choosers with where they sit in the ground. Do you have a local supporters club? Depending on the branch, they get quite favourable seats and generally have more than a few to flog depending on the game so that might boost your chances also.

If the home fixtures don't work out and you don't get a chance to sit in the main stand, could try your best to get an away game - the atmosphere at Anfield isn't even close to what it used to be, but away games are always bouncing.

However, there are many ways to do that, and right now I think the club is putting too much emphasis on making money off tickets and not enough priority on ensuring availability and affordability of tickets for genuine fans, which in turn is going to have a terrible impact on the grounds atmosphere, which also has a huge impact on the teams ability to play well…We all know how easy it is going to Arsenal away, and how difficult it is to go to PSG or Liverpool away, the crowd is a fundamental factor in this",null,0,null,1439314600,null,null,false,0,ctzd3ru,null,t3_3glmnr,null,null,null,t1_ctzbe4b,null,null,null,1440417101,null,6,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6,null

So, for money that you never even see in your net salary (and so doesn't really impact you) then you'll have 160% of that entire annual salary when you retire.

People say it's a stupid cliche to excuse immature behaviour but every time Chelsea gets a result that's not a win there's ALWAYS a bigger story the media reports on rather than the player performance and that bigger story is ALWAYS gossipy crap that originates from Mourinho.
SAF was the same and people would, similarly, always laugh when people would call his antics mind games but he, like, Mourinho was just as effective at shielding his players from scrutiny after bad games.

Anyone else think this is actually a smart move from Mourinho? Clearly it's slightly absurd and the medical staff does not deserve the criticism they've been getting, but it is true that the media has not focused at all on our lackluster week 1 performance and has instead focused on the debacle between Jose and Carneiro.

If I am riding in the right tyre track, as I have done often and as a rider riding two abreast would likely do, and a car wishes to pass me, if it pulls fully into the right hand lane to a point that it is driving in the tyre tracks of that lane 1) there will be more than enough room (I can say this because this exact situtation happened yesterday and it was not a problem at all) and 2) if the rider feels the driver is still too close he can easily slow to be slightly behind the other rider and pull into the middle of the lane. If you pull properly into the right lane you would be as safe as if you were simply driving the opposite way towards the riders on the other side of the road. That is more than enough. It's more than enough for me riding, so it's more than enough for you driving.

They haven't been going for hundreds of years across the whole of society. The number of young people that have them nowadays compared to 30 years ago isn't even close.

On FC, if you have loan parts at above the average interest rate for a risk band, you can actually sell them with a markup and make a profit on the deal. I have done this.

&gt; If you're investing for the long term and you don't have index funds, then index funds will probably get you the better return

Going forward from the current valuations my estimation is that FC's gross return will exceed that of most index funds.

Bike trousers will protect you from road rash and joint impacts, but in all honesty, they are unlikely to save your life. They are relatively irritating to deal with day-to-day, much more so than other items of gear.

Personally, I ride with jeans (kevlar if they're clean, non-kevlar if the kevlars are in the wash) 90% of the time, and have a pair of waterproof textile trousers which fit over regular jeans quite comfortably, which I use for wet weather and longer or more dangerous rides. I don't wear them on my 1.5 mile commute, but I do for an hour's backlane scratching or whatever.

The hassle is not as bad as you might think, provided you've got somewhere to put them wherever you're going. They're the big bit of gear that can really impede your ability to go places if you haven't got panniers or similar, though, so I can understand wanting to avoid them.

One last thought: you're a brand-new rider. Your crash risk is exceptionally high, and will be for quite a while. I always think of gear choices as a matter of balancing the risk; the chance of falling off on a trip down to the shops is minimal, and the injuries involved are likely to be relatively minimal too, at 20-30mph. I'd wear less gear in that circumstance than if I was going 50 miles to visit a friend down in Birmingham.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but is the team medical doctor not responsible for those stats.

Well it's not always that simple is it, depends on type of players, how players got injured and the extent of the injuries, even the condition of the pitch could be a factor.

Not to say she's not well qualified and many Chelsea fans seem to feel the medical team are large factor in their keeping the team fit.

Look at the Guardian's story about how the benefits being received in EU countries by British Nationals outnumbers the equivalent nationality receiving benefits in the UK. Once you got past the headline and the paragraph it was clear it focused on a few developed nations and overall 'British' as a nationality is at a net deficit for benefits received as it's overwhelmed by the other nations such as Poland. Yet the story makes it seem Britain claims more. Just a small thing but an example of how it's possible to distort without lying which is the accusation levelled at the right-wing press. 

I will concede however there are more right-wing publications than left-wing publications. However I also think there are more mediums out there than just the printed press. I find it ironic that people bemoan the bias in the printed press on Reddit when there is a huge liberal bias on here too. People tend to gravitate to their own existing bias.

Maybe it's the wrong way around; *People aren't right-wing because of the press, the press is right-wing because of the people*. That might be a bit too simplistic but so is the suggestion that it's the other way around.

I agree that I don't like the state breathing down my neck, but I would certainly be happy with saying that in *all* schools (Islamic or not), under 18s may not wear anything covering their face. If a girl spends all her teenage years socialising normally, and wearing nothing more than a hair veil, and then wants to cover her face as an adult, I don't like it, but fair enough.

Bedminster itself would be really good as it's near the town, yet far enough that the rates would be lower. Wherever you go there will be people that love the location and people that hate the location.

I'd suggest taking a trip into B-I-G down on Clothier Road in Brislington and speaking to the owners Jim and Andy. The used to run The Giants Lair in Plymouth until recently and relocated up here about a year ago. They are more of a Wargaming venue that has board gaming evenings but I know Jim did a lot of research into Bristol before he moved up, and he's a really nice guy.

A little bit of digging this week, as we take a look at players who have only scored once for Chelsea. In the last 25 years, 23 players have netted a solitary goal for Chelsea : 

* Filipe Luis (14-15)

* Azpilicueta (13-14)

* Marin,  Romeu (12-13)

* Benayoun, Van Aanholt, Zhirkov (10-11)

* Sidwell, Sinclair (07-08)

* Del Horno (05-06)

* Smertin (04-05)

* Veron, Parker (03-04)

* De Lucas (02-03)

* Panucci (00-01)

* Ambrosetti, Deschamps, Ferrer (99-00)

* Casiraghi, Hopkin (94-95)

* Hoddle, Johnsen (93-94)


We find mostly one season stints, former youths and friends of John *""he scores when he wants""* Obi Mikel like Deschamps or Azpi. 


Some of those goals were just as forgettable as their names, but others really put all their talent in that one goal :

Newcastle have a chairman that seemingly resents the club and has used his purchase as a grand advertising board for Sports Direct but has pretty much been forced to spend and improve and they've spent near on £30m to not drop further back in the pecking order.

Yes, the window isn't over but the longer we wait the more players leave for other prospective clubs and we're forced to look further down the transfer target list.

null,null,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;But we have more than ever now.

The ""more than ever"" is a direct response to the push-back since 9/11. There have been Pakistani and Bandgadeshi muslims in Britain for at least fifty years, and their tradition was always to wear those colourful shalwar kameeze with a filmy chiffon scarf that went around the throat or sometimes around the hair.

It wasn't till after the backlash from 9/11 that they started to ditch that tradition and ""arabize"" in sympathy. It's a circling the wagons response. It's no different from telling a teen that they shouldn't get a tattoo for them to go right out and do it.

Rather than banning things and making them feel they must circle the wagons even more, we should leave it alone and support those who want to leave islam - who find it very hard because of people like you stereotyping the lot.

Note that if you ban islamic symbols, you also need to ban other religious stuff, like those nuns that go completely veiled - that's oppression too as far as I'm concerned, and those hassidic jewish societies. 

The American approach which is you don't ban anything, you just draw people in with the power of your inclusiveness works much better. There are lots of muslims in the United States, but they don't feel under the same religious pressure, which means that not only do they not opt for arabisation in their clothes, they are also leaving islam in great numbers and assimilating. And all because no-one has taken an authoritarian approach to them like the one you are suggesting.",null,0,null,1439317521,null,null,false,0,ctzf6s4,null,t3_3gkxb0,null,null,null,t1_ctzemfe,null,null,null,1440418083,null,-2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,-2,null

The one bastard time you wear thin jeans because you're going somewhere and don't want to change WILL be the day a car hits you and you can only walk with a limp again for the rest of your life. Sod's law. 

Basically I recommend getting a box put on your bike or get a rucksack and just keep a spare pair of trousers and change when you get to your destination. Also some motorcycle jeans with kevlar are less noticeable than leathers but it's clear its a safety trouser up close and they are not as safe at high speeds. If you're just going into a shop, just go into the shop in your gear. But don't...just don't skip the gear please. 

If it's annoying, then don't get the bike. Your flesh and bone won't hold up to steel mate. Also, your budget for your gear should be as much as it costs to protect your entire body head to toe...whatever that cost is. If it costs 1k, don't try to skimp and get the gear later when you have money, buy it now. If you can't afford to protect yourself, get a cheaper bike and pay for the gear. AND WEAR THE GEAR. I see idiots on the road in sweatpants and a t-shirt and it makes me cringe...all it takes is one idiot car driver, one pothole, one pedestrian to rush into view and bam you're on the floor.

Heya Guys,


I am currently trying to build a pc from scratch from only used parts and with a very limited budget. ( If you see linustechtips, then kinda of a scrapyard contest with some friends )


I will be looking for almost anything that you might have ( mobo's , cpu's , gpu's , cases etc etc.. )


Since we have been ""sponsored"" , I will be paying only with **amazon gift card**. It will be delivered on your email and you can use it as regular amazon balance.


Post prices with post included only please


Collection from manchester available.


Cheers

Yes. It's not to do with islam per se, but to do with acceptance of religion.

It's not to do with explicit crackdowns but how they are subtly treated. In the united states people are tolerant of religion - and as a result muslims in the US feel less pressured.

France does *not* have perfect integration. They've just sent people underground where they can't be watched as the whole Charlie Hebdo thing proved. Having things underground is not desirable - we can't tell what is happening that way.

If authoritarianism really worked, NI would be the best place in the UK - but it's the worst *because* it's authoritarian and intolerant.

This seems pretty standard for any kind of contracted work like this - extra work being done by other contractors is the clients responsibility. The stonemason doesn't work for the mother. Frankly, I'm surprised the stonemason isn't asking the client to pay for their work, however badly it was done.

It will come down to whatever was agreed was the ""whole project' as OP says. Hopefully this is all done on paper and signed.

Unfortunately the client just sounds like an arse: ""who was already making a fuss over the fact she had the pay for the design"" - God forbid you have to pay someone for their work. For me that would have been the first sign to stay away from that client :)

I've lived in NI, Scotland and France. You evidently haven't as you repeatedly talk out your arse on all of them. Your claim on NI is 100% wrong. You know nothing about France's integration or muslims there clearly. And in the past you've said that SNP voters voted for them because they wanted to get rich off oil money. You haven't a fucking clue. 

&gt;we think you lot in NI are incredibly religious and intolerant, and some of that is now being directed at muslims too.

Look who's judging people as a group now

As it is, I'm part of a young left-leaning NI generation who despise religion because of what it has done to NI. The english who don't mind the growth of Islam don't know what it's like to live surrounded by religious bigots. 

&gt;In the united states people are tolerant of religion - and as a result muslims in the US feel less pressured.

Source? Because if you know as much about the US as you do on Scotland, NI or France, you know nothing.

&gt;Try loosening up and becoming more open-minded

Try learning about what you're talking about, rather than making shit up and insulting people

&gt;Attacking people

Yup, protecting under 18s from the worst of religious indoctrination is so mean of me.

null,null,SirBlah,Glamorgan,Cardiffian,null,"One of the main purposes of a railway network is to create an integrated system, which connects communities across the country together without having to switch between modes of transport. The Welsh railway network is not that, in fact it cannot really be considered a single network to begin with as nothing is really connected together.

A good example is Aberystwyth, a university town on the west coast that houses a number of important institutions. [Now this town has a railway line connecting it, but unless you live in the English town of Shrewsbury or one of the small towns near the line, the railway is essentially useless, it's not connected to any of the major population centres of Wales either north or south.](http://www.walesdirectory.co.uk/maps/pics/railways.gif)

But if the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line was rebuilt, then suddenly this changes, it would now be possible to take a train directly from Swansea, Cardiff, and Newport to the town and it's university. The railway becomes a viable transport mode, and would have a massive knock-on effect for the economy of the western coast of Wales. 

Not only that, but trains could then continue northwards into Snowdonia, and now a person would be able to take a train directly from Cardiff to many of the towns in and around Snowdonia: Barmouth, Harlech, Porthmadog etc etc. That could have a knock-on effect for the economy of this area as well, *especially* for tourism. rebuild the line between Porthmadog and Bangor and suddenly towns like Caernarfon benefit from this as well, and you now have a new north to south railway line which travels across the west coast of Wales.

The same can be said for rebuilding the old Mid Wales line, which went through the Brecon Beacons into the town of Brecon, Builth Wells, and northwards, connecting them with towns in the valleys, and Cardiff.

An important aspect of this is that *these railway lines used to exist*. most of them were simply dismantled back in the 60's, but most of the bridges, tunnels and cuttings still exist, and only a very small amount of the line has been built upon, it's just a matter of relaying the track.

The fact is Wales has a very small population, and much of the country has fragile economies which are almost completely cut off from each other due to the lack of infrastructure, whether that's rail or the road network, which is usually completely unsuitable for moving freight around. I think it's important to recognise that if we take the argument that the only railway lines worth keeping are the profitable ones then outside south east Wales there shouldn't be any railways in Wales at all. 
Building a railway line brings knock-on value that's worth far more then just money from the tickets, and I think we need to start not only investing in infrastructure to meet demand, but investing in infrastructure to create demand, to grow the economies of areas currently stagnate.",null,0,null,1439320336,null,null,1439320521,0,ctzh568,null,t3_3gm2yp,null,null,null,t1_ctzdzy4,null,null,null,1440419004,null,28,null,Wales,t5_2qhrl,28,null

I _personally_ think you have a strong case. I'd telephone the dealership and say you're not happy, and would like someone to review your case. I think you can explain you've had a professional third-party analysis and they say the car was rusty when you bought it.

If they fob you off, you have a couple of options. Maybe telephone head office to see if they have a complaints department. Remember to be courteous at all stages of the process. If that fails, then write them a letter, setting out the problem you have. Add your telephone number to the letter.

If they do not respond within 10 days, write again but mention court action, if you are willing to actually do that. Or you could write a letter to Trading Standards.

Their goodwill cheque may be that they feel caught in the corner but are unwilling to do the repair. I would press harder, but of course you are welcome to accept if you wish.

null,null,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt; Look who's judging people as a group now

OK, I'll explain things from an English point of view. We're a majority agnostic country and we view most terrorism as a result of religious nutjobs. Irish terrorism to us was a result of *Irish religious nutjobs*. The irish used to get a lot of hate for that - and we've simply moved that to muslims - who are now behaving *exactly* like the Irish did in the 1980's as a result - very defensive.

&gt;The english who don't mind the growth of Islam don't know what it's like to live surrounded by religious bigots.

And why do you think religious bigots existed in Ireland but not in England, in the first place? 

*Because of the heavy-handed approach in NI*. It made the Irish *cling even harder* to their religion. Whereas in England people were pretty chilled and hence no irish style extremism developed. If you push people, they push back. If you ban things they cling to them that much tighter.

&gt;Your claim on NI is 100% wrong

Really? Why do people there vote on religious lines? Why are there still bombs having to be defused there every month? Because they are authoritarian and intolerant of course. It's interesting to note that we have less terrorism from muslims in Britain than we do from NI. See the following:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31018191

347 bombs had to be defused in NI in 2014 alone.
