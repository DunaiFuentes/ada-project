null,false,AcaiPalm,lfc68,,null,"&gt;Lucas fully fit has the most interceptions and tackles in the team.

When fully fit Lucas plays the holding midfield role, the position where you would expect the player makes the most tackles and interceptions. For the sake of argument lets discuss the performances of Allen and Lucas this season whilst remembering that Allen has been injured for some months since the first international break of the season where he injured his knee on a terrible 3G pitch in Andorra. This season they have both been most successful when playing the same role in the double pivot of the 3-4-3 alongside Henderson, as Lucas struggled alongside Gerrard in midfield due to both of their lack of mobility (but that's a different kettle of fish). The argument for Lucas is that when we first started playing with this formation, it coincided with his return to the starting eleven and improved defensive performances. However a lot of these games early in the run of using the 3-4-3 were against lower table teams. I would argue that some of our best football this season with the 3-4-3 formation was when Allen partnered Henderson in the midfield, this included the run of games where we beat Southampton, Tottenham and Manchester City. 

&gt;Henderson has the most assists and 3rd highest on goals. 

This was also the run of games where Henderson scored 4 goals, but playing alongside either Lucas or Allen allows Henderson to contribute more to the attacking side of the game as he doesn't have to worry as much about his defensive duties. 
 

This was only the second time this season that Lucas and Allen played in the same team together as far as I recall, and I think it is in a system which suits both of their talents. The 4-3-3 is a highly complex system for the three midfield players, where you have one holding player/deep playmaker, a midfield playmaker and a creative number 10. During tonight's game Lucas occupied the holding role and Henderson and Allen rotated in the midfield playmaker and creative roles.

Whats important to understand is that what is required in these roles is fundamentally different, the playmaker roles also have to consistently circulate possession often taking easy short passes so that the creative midfielder and attacking players can organize themselves for the next attacking phase. Such is the range of skills and tactical understanding required by midfield players for each of these positions you cannot make a straight comparison between them, they all bring different things to the table. Just as in the 3-4-3 where Henderson's creative potential is unlocked by the holding midfielder in the pivot, you cannot judge a midfielder's ability by what he does in a game without appreciating the effect of their presence on the players around them. Joe Allen is not very well appreciated in this sub because more often than not the role he is asked to play is to support other players, cover for them when they go forward and to recycle and maintain possession. **These are all key aspects of modern football and without appreciation of this you will never truly understand the value of a Joe Allen type player**, who is able to do this consistently while offering a myriad of other thing such as phenomenal work rate and intelligent pressing and closing of passing channels. 


I did not try to insult you, I was just to tired to go into the detail required to make a case for the footballing ability of Joe Allen, especially when speaking with someone who does not appear to be able to see further than stats on tackles, interceptions, goals and assists.

null,false,sacredstones,null,null,null,"this was my first criticism of him and I was especially frustrated because at the time he was predominantly our RW. 

I think his first few seasons he was making conservative choices because he wasn't comfortable. However, now I think that he has matured and really grown a pair. especially when Stevie first handed him the armband. His passing has become balanced. I know exactly what you mean. There would be so many times where our forward ran into some space and instead of taking the risk and trusting the forward with the ball, Hendo would pass back and play would be switched. Used to be almost always ""negative"" but now he plays forward when he should. He also plays great diagonal crosses that all of us enjoy. 

Right now the worst aspect to his game is that he isn't confident with the ball at his feet. Lucas and Allen can slip out of an incoming challenge regularly Allen often takes it a step further, bringing the ball up himself. If henderson can develop this part of his game I think he'd be a perfect midfielder. As he is now, I don't think he's too negative. he's still very conservative, but this season he's starting to trust his teammates more and make those forward passes more often. Once he starts getting closer to the box and more adventurous, we can see more of what we saw today. One-touch passing second to none that can hopefully unlock a few defences.

Now you have a catholic 11+ and a protestant 11+. Education has been further divided. Take DRD when Conor M was Minister, his dept was successfully sued because it was proved that an appointment was denied to a successful candidate because of their religion and SF wanted their own man in.

I mean the last time we saw the Master he was on the verge of death, having made up past quarrels with the Doctor spending the last of his energy to attack Rassilon, leader of the time lords on their final attempt to save Gallifrey on the last day of the time war.

What if Rassilon, took a near dead Master gave him a new cycle but sent him to Earth in a new form to find the Doctor, someone he would least expect.  Enter Ellie circa late 1980's saving Dave Oswald from a fate similar to Danny's.  The two get married, have a child meet then meet the 11th Doctor during his investigation of Clara, Ellie knows something's up with weird familiar person, fast forward a few years and the Doctor while looking for Clara after The Snowmen runs into an older version he didn't realize only for Ellie to remember that same face from years earlier.  Memories come back, finds a Gallifreyan fob watch it all comes back but she stayed for Clara.  Fast forward to 2005, the 9th Doctor faces off against the autons then blows up Henrik's.  What if Ellie, who died on the day the Doctor came back from the Time War, was either killed by the blast or by the autons?  Either way that triggers regeneration into Missy, she remembers her assignment which is to get the Doctor to save Gallifrey.  How, through Clara (who may be more than even she knows).  You get the of the Doctor trilogy and the Doctor's life is saved, Gallifrey stands and he gains a new cycle. 

The whole point with Missy at this point is to do whatever to keep the Doctor and Clara together even if it means killing people close to Clara.  For some reason, she's had an eye on Clara, for no specified reason.  My thinking is she's watched her entire life, she knows the Doctor won't do anything he's not supposed to like the boyfriend bit, but mainly through her she's their way back to the home planet the key now is eliminating obstacles.  To her Danny was the anchor to Earth for Clara.  Now that he's out of the way and she and the Doctor are now a team.  The only way forward is home, maybe.

TL;DR - My theory is that the Master was forcibly regenerated to Earth where she saved Dave Oswald becoming along the way mother to Clara.  She met the Doctor enough times it led to her remembering who she was and the mission from Rassilon to save Gallifrey.  She eliminates any and all things in the way to make sure Clara and the Doctor meet and stay together (including Danny) so they all can make the trek back to Gallifrey.",null,0,null,1428543282,null,0,false,0,cq623pg,null,t3_31xsx1,null,t1_cq623pg,null,t3_31xsx1,null,null,null,1432280568,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

You claimed Lucas should be getting more interceptions and tacklers, but in the 3-4-3 formation, Allen and Lucas have rotated next to Henderson for the most part with Gerrards injury and suspension. Both were playing a similar role next Henderson and even though we were playing against lower level teams, we still picked up wins whilst our defence looked strong with Lucas in front of them. In addition, we lost to lower level teams before Lucas came into the squad and we changed to a 3-4-3. IIRC our 3-0 win over Tottenham was the first start Lucas was granted and not only did the defence look a lot more sturdy than it did against City (losing 3-1 that game) but Lovren had his first convincing performance with Lucas in front of him. Both Lucas and Allen play a support role, albeit slightly different. Lucas is slightly more defensive than the 2 in the 3-4-3 formation and covers the defence more. You mentioned Tottenham, City and Southampton. In 2 of those games, we did not keep a clean sheet and the other we were dominated in midfield (by Southampton) and were fortunate to get a win. If we are playing either Allen or Lucas next to Henderson, Lucas shows our team to have a better all round defensive performance. Allen does not do too much in way of key passes and attacks, his strengths are more to do with ball retention and high press. In my opinion, Lucas' defensive strengths outweigh Allen offensive ability when picking either or. 

I don't think the player roles of our midfield 3 are a holding role, playmaker role and a number 10. Lucas played holding. But we didn't have a NO.10 tonight and I feel Allen played more of a box to box role. High work rate, pressing and short passing being solid attributes for both Henderson and Allen mean they are interchangeable during the game. One can cover another's role. However, When Henderson drops back and Allen moves forward he doesn't show much in way of creativity. Like you said he circulates possession well, but he can't find a killer pass unlike Henderson. 

Last season we played a 4-3-3. And at some point we played Gerrard, Henderson and Coutinho as our 3 (The Arsenal game). If we swap Lucas out for Gerrard. We could have a holding mid, box to box and a NO.10/Playmaker and I think this is our best 3.

Overall, I don't believe Allen to be good enough to start for us on a consistent basis. He plays a good support role, but if we are looking for a support player I think Lucas is the better choice. If we play 3-4-3. And if we play 4-3-3 I think Coutinho could be a better fit than Allen in there. 

""I foresee that I would have more success trying to reason with the lamp on my bedside table."" Not really sure how this isn't an insult. But this is a minor point in context to the Allen argument.

Its very interesting. I hope you are interested because finances are clearly defined. Chelsea has won much more -contributing more from European funds (CL) than Arsenal.

The grievance Gunners fans frequently express is being outspent. I understand, it hurts seeing you beloved Arsenal (84m) getting outspent by even Tottenham (100m), but its a paradox because of the new stadium. Debt incurred is nearly half a billion pounds. Its ironic, because like FFP amortisation spreading the burden of a transfer fee over the length of the contract, the sale of Highbury has allowed the Gunners to balance the ledger over the length of the loan on Emirates stadium. The financial management has come at the cost of ineffective and too little transfers, and no major silverware this past decade. But Arsenal operated at consistent profits for twelve years. If Arsenal have operated at a profit for the last twelve years, why are they preparing to raise ticket prices?

So around half of the available x/z berths have effectively disappeared. Even major naval ports are dubious locations due to the high density civilian population nearby. 

Effectively, there are few places that these subs could be move to, without cause a large cost and danger to somewhere else within the UK. As it stands, they are in the optimal location it seems, and to move it for political gain would seem folly. Yes you could move it to the arse end of nowhere, but then the costs of the program would shoot up and cause multiple additional issues.

The current location would cause the least amount of damage if there was an accident (in a populated area), and provides millions in work and income to the area. The issue is that if there was an accident, that the Firth of Forth would likely be heavily affected causing excessive economic damage. Sadly, this is our option we have today and we can only hope that there are sufficient plans for all situations. 

TLDR: To get rid of the program would be nice, but a folly. To move the program somewhere remote would be nice, but a minor folly. A significant amount of resources and economic power would have to be redirected on the moving of a defensive capability because no one wants to be near it.",null,0,null,1428547369,null,0,false,0,cq64jeh,null,t3_31x9vd,null,t1_cq64jeh,null,t1_cq6297o,null,null,null,1432281716,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I thought that it was that City needs to lose one game or draw both and Arsenal only needs to tie against Burnley or Sunderland. Plus obviously we'd need to win our games

Edit: So I just did the math.

Current Table:

1. Chelsea 70 points

2. Arsenal 63 points (Max possible 84)

3. United 62 points (Max possible 83)

4. City 61 points (Max possible 82)

If we win our next four games (the fourth being Arsenal), we'll be at 82 points

* If Arsenal draw any of their next two games, their max possible will be 82 before our game, after our game (assuming we win) their max is 79

* This scenario only works if we win all of our games, we play United before Arsenal so their max would be 80 after we win

* If City draw any of their next three games (three games because their day 34 game is a day before ours) then their max will be 80

These are the only teams that could potentially prevent us from clinching if we win our next four.

Actually looking back on it now, unless I calculated wrong, we only need City to drop a single point in their next three games. Because beating Arsenal would put them at 81 max right? And we'd be at 82",null,0,null,1428547514,null,0,1428549657,0,cq64mhs,null,t3_31y1qu,null,t1_cq64mhs,null,t3_31y1qu,null,null,null,1432281757,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

People throw out arbitrary meaningless figures all the time that it costs X amount of billions, but in the end those billions go to British engineering companies, paying British graduates, to work on British built submarines, that money is just circulating in Britain and getting sucked up in income tax, VAT, NI, it isn't an actual cost. 

Then add in the research and development and technological gains which can be sold to other countries, as well as advancements that can be used to create new British products which can be sold bring more money into Britain, when you add all this together, is it actually a net loss? And if it is, how much by, because those billions aren't just going into a drain, they are paying people who spend the money, they are creating intellectual property, they are making actual sell-able high value products.

I don't know how much is lost or gained in the trident project, and I would be interested to know, but I know in the case of medical science funding it has been shown to have a 20-30% rate of return and a 20% social rate of return. 

Once again this is just an issue which has become a political football so people ignore actual relevant issues, the real question is if this Football is actually even costing the country anything in the first place? Because if it isn't, then it really is just a smokescreen so they can avoid issue that actually matter, and even if it is costing money, how much is a nuclear defence worth?

From an employees side, but not from an industrial side. British manufacturing was in the gutter during the 1970's, and manufacturing productivity jumped tremendously after her regime. Earnings didn't rise the at the same rate under Thatcher, but that was needed in order to counter the massive inflation epidemic in the UK at the time. 

Also, not a single proper government in the world doesn't run monetary policy as a method to control the money supply. Any government relying on solely Keynesian economics is in the stone age, and is bound to end up in the exact same place as the UK was in the late 1970's - high inflation, massive budget deficit, and a huge inefficient public bureaucracy.

Edit: I'm actually writing an economics paper on Thatcher's industrial policies now in the manufacturing sector, if any of you lot would like to see any sources (out of curiosity or just because you doubt me) I'd gladly supply.

Most modern teams only have three strikers in their squad, and therefore playing two of them most weeks means you only have one backup if someone goes down, or you need to bring on fresh legs.

Plus, it often leaves you being overrun in midfield, because most teams will pack that part of the pitch.

I think either a 4-4-1-1, with a secondary striker who drops back and hassles the CDM a lot, or a formation similar to our current one, but with actually fast wingers who can shuttle vertically up and down the pitch, are probably better suited to the current style of the EPL.

A big part of our current problem is that we don't have any particularly quick players other than Townsend, and so little chance to break quickly from defence to attack.

To your point, the extra seats alone is not what seats Arsenal apart. Arsenal and Man U bring in about 1,500 annually per seat. Liverpool bring in around 900. So extra seats alone will not get you there, you have to increase revenue per seat. 

“If Anfield yielded £1550 per seat, without adding seats, LFC match-day revenue would rise from £41M to £71M.  That would be the same as building a new stadium with 60,000 seats or increasing seating at Anfield and increasing revenue per seat to £1170.

The War Doctor *was* great. He was close enough to the Valeyard without just being a villain (an evil Doctor always was a stupid idea) or a rehash of TOATL.

The end of the Doctor's regeneration cycle really was a chance to do something new ... nope just more ""regeneration energy"". Weakest possible outcome.

And the Doctor's graveyard with his ""corpse"" was actually ripe with possibilities - when the Doctor entered his own ""story"" I actually though Moffat had something incredibly mind-blowing in store for the 50th and the ""end of regenerations"" but ... he just rescued Clara. What?

null,false,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,null,"&gt;He's been at fault for loads of loads and defensive errors this season.

I think this tends to be exaggerated a bit. There's been a few high profile mistakes, but *most* of the time he is still one of the best defenders in the league. Perhaps other than Clyne there's not another RB in the league he wouldn't start over IMO. Rightfully so, we hold him to high standards appropriate to our ambition and emphasis on a strong defense, but keep in mind that he's pretty clearly been given instructions from his manager to 1) get higher up the pitch to contribute more width in the attack and 2) defend high up the pitch to discourage opposition fullbacks from venturing too far. That leaves holes at the back, which he needs help to cover from 1) Cahill, who's not repeated last season's form and 2) Fabregas, who ideally should cover at RB the way Matic is often filling in at LB. 

On top of those obvious aspects of attacking and defending, he's crucial to the team in other ways. For example, he is often the best option for Courtois when he kicks long, which is vital in keeping possession and moving the ball up the pitch quickly. There's also the issue of setpieces, and in both boxes he is probably our best player which IMO is huge. Games are often won and lost on details like setpieces.

The reason you don't really see him flying in is because he either blocks the pass or closes it down before the player even receives the ball.

null,false,addyman,null,null,null,"When you have exported your car from Spain, you must have your French insurance, temporary or otherwise and you want to get the all-important French number plates for your car. You will need the following documents:

Quitus Fiscale (déclaration d’impôt). Available from your local tax office, this a documents that show your local sub-prefecture that VAT has been paid on your vehicle when it was brought into the country, otherwise they could in theory charge tax you on the car. Not good. VAT should not be payable on cars imported from within the EU, but the authorities may require this document to prove that. If you are importing a car from outside the EU, duty is payable at the point of entry and you will need a customs document to again prove that any VAT or other applicable taxes have been paid (Certificat de Douane 846A). You will need proof of your address in France, such as an EDF bill, proof of your identity such as a passport and your original sales receipt from where you bought the car for the Quitus Fiscale. They can’t tax you twice in theory and your sales invoice will show that UK duty has been paid on your recently purchased mean machine. So, this bit of paper may not always be needed, but check it is easy to obtain and something you should have before you try to re-register.
Proof of Identity. This is usually a passport in the case of UK citizens who do not carry identity cards as a matter of course. Photo driving licences also work.
Proof of Address. An EDF bill dated within three months of your registration works wonders. Water bills are also good or telephone bills. Don’t try to bring your tax foncieres or tax d’habitation bills or a water bill. The authorities are not keen on those as a proof of address. Recent utilities are the way to go and EDF is king.
Certificate of Conformity. (certificat/attestation de conformité). This basically says your car has not been altered and of original manufacturers’ construction. This is generally expected to be in French and it usually costs money. You can try to obtain the certificate from the UK manufacturer of your vehicle. It is usually the Homologation Department whomever you approach and they may or may not charge you. Please note the authorities in France may not accept the UK document as it is not from the French branch of your manufacturer and I believe the rules on this have changed recently requiring the prefecture to have a certificate of conformity from your manufacturer in France. The French counterpart of your car’s manufacturer will undoubtedly charge you for the certificate of conformity and the charges do vary. A Mini certificate cost €170 from BMW Paris and it basically re-produced the information contained in the UK V5 registration document that was already labeled as a European certificate of Conformity. I have heard it possible to re-register a car in France without this certificate if you argue that your UK document meets the requirement and provides the information needed. There are databases available to check these things. Line K of your logbook “Type Approval Number” is the key. However, I would recommend going to the prefecture in person if you want to try to re-register without the certificate of conformity. Make sure you speak or go with someone who speaks good French. All UK registered cars from around 2008 should automatically have European registration documents that are in theory certificates of conformity and that can be checked on a database. The information provided to BMW in Paris was as I said earlier pretty much all contained in the UK V5 document. I spent an interesting afternoon looking for serial numbers on my car to double check this and had to record the information on a form BMW France had provided. If you are as car or engine illiterate as I am, it was quite enlightening. I took a copy of my certificate of conformity before I went to the Prefecture There are online providers of certificates of conformity, but I cannot attest to their validity or the security of such sites.
Valid Contrôle Technique (CT report). This is the French equivalent of the MOT, which is required for cars of four years and older. You must have a CT that is dated within six months of re-registering the car. To obtain a CT, you are often asked for a certificate of conformity. This is not always the case. Check your UK reg document and line K. If the type approval number starts: e*2001/, then you may well be able to obtain your CT without a certificate of conformity for the car. You will need to check this at your local CT Centre.
Your original car registration document. Please note that when they process your Carte Grise (French car registration document) the authorities at the prefecture will take your original UK or original car registration document from the country of origin. My advice to you all is to take a copy of this before you re-register your vehicle, just in case.
I also brought my insurance documentation just in case, which wasn’t requested. You should have these documents in the car at all times and better to be safe than sorry.",null,0,null,1428560252,null,0,false,0,cq6aj0g,null,t3_31wfs7,null,t1_cq6aj0g,null,t1_cq6af6t,null,null,null,1432284609,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,technicalthrowaway,null,null,null,"&gt; Wow...that is the best you can come up with, 

...Your ""evidence"" included research where somebody basically showed 200 internet strangers pictures of raves and then asked them what they thought about MDMA... That evidence has no relevance to a debate on *physiological addiction*. Gauging peoples responses to cues which aren't the actual chemical itself is testing psychological addiction, and that doesn't even begin to address the problems of self-report of internet strangers methodology.

&gt; The fact that this is the best you can come up with is just proof that I was correct in the first place,it sounds less addictive than alcohol, and that is legal for everyone. 

Except your argument wasn't that ""MDMA is less addictive than alcohol,"" because if it were, I would have smiled, and nodded and not bothered responding, because I 100% agree with that - that is fact  -we're probably both aware of Professor Nutt's work. But that's not what you stated originally. 

&gt; Chronic MDMA tolerance, you mean like chronic anything tolerance, be it alcohol, caffeine, sugar. That is not a reason to class something as illegal, not to mention that people aren't taking MDMA chronically, they are consuming it like people binge drink.

You and I clearly operated in different circles at uni. I've seen friends taking it 7 days a week for months. Not lots of friends, but it does happen, and all the research we both cited mentioned cases of problematic addiction, albeit rare. And that's the point I'm making. It's not a bad drug, it's not anywhere near as dangerous or addictive as alcohol - I never claimed that - but to say ""MDMA isn't addictive"" like you did, is flat out wrong. My original post that you critiqued as scaremongering may have sounded that way because my specific point was to address your wrong rose tinted view of the substance. Yes it's a nice substance and relatively safe, and should probably be regulated, but it *is* addictive. That doesn't change that it's still relatively safe and enjoyable though.

We both have our anecdotes, and we've both presented evidence which both conclude it is addictive, I think I've made my point that the chemical MDMA can be addictive. Yet you seem to refuse to accept, even in light of your own evidence, that the statement ""MDMA isn't addictive"" simply isn't supported by ANY literature - seriously, not one piece either of us has cited, *even your own*, has denied that MDMA addiction doesn't happen.

If you want drugs legislation based on scientific evidence, which I do and you probably do, then going around spreading misinformation like ""MDMA isn't addictive"" only harms your own cause, because all your opposition has to do is read any literature on MDMA to find people saying it can be addictive and then you and your side loses credibility.

**Vietto**: out of all of players you listed, he comes the closest when compared to the game we play here.  The problem, is that many of the big clubs are probably going to make a bid for this guy.  I don't think we stand much of a chance.
**Dybala**: same thing applies for him (like Vietto, he's on everyone's radar which means trouble for us if we're serious about going after him).  From what I've seen, he's alright.  He seems to have the same trouble that Sturridge has and that is, he hates to use his right foot.  That's not a bad thing but it's something he would need to improve on.
**Gignac**: maybe not the most flashy out of the bunch but he does have 18 league goals this year.  He's an opportunist (or poacher) and seems to be very effective in front of goal.

I didn't like that a lot of the time it seemed like Clara was the focal point of the show. We just got a new Doctor and it felt like he was placed in a supporting role too much of the time. 

I'm also tired of the ""companion trying to live a normal life and the Doctor shows up now and again to wisk then away on an adventure"" bit. It was interesting when the Pond's lived that life for a while, especially considering their conflict as to whether or not they could keep doing this or if they had to let their life with the Doctor go, especially considering how focal a point he was in their lives. However it's less interesting now that it's making the Doctor out to be a secondary character in his own show. 
I would love some kind of scenario where a companion couldn't go home for some reason and it became a goal to get them home, maybe paralleling the Doctor's own journey to get back to his home. 

All that being said, there was a lot to like about season 8, I just hope Capaldi gets more room to shine next season and he's allowed to be characterized beyond a grumpy foil to Clara's egotism.

At midseason even carra and neville said he's the best defender in the league, let alone the best fullback. Although that's only half the season, I believe he's been fantastic in the second part of the season as well. In recent games he wasn't really talked about much but he was absolutely perfect. He shuts down his flank brilliantly and its part of the reason why the opposition focus on penetrating our right side rather than our left, although ivanovic's questionable defending plays a part in that. 

You're right though, Dave on the right and Bertrand on the left would be a dream. If dave is this good playing out of position then we can imagine how much better he'd be if he played on the right.

Firstly with your GP, they can send referral follow-ups with delays this long.

Secondly figure out *where* you were being referred and start calling the departments involved directly. No need to be pushy, in my experience most hospital admins will respond very well to a ""I'm concerned my referral has been lost, can you check if I'm listed on your system?"" enquiry. Sometimes there will be a central booking center for your area, they will know and can direct you on who to call.

Thirdly if you have, or can get, the details of the head of the department that you are being referred to see if you can get hold of his/her secretary or PA. It could be you are being refused an MRI until an Ultrasound is done, or something similar, but the paperwork has got lost between departments.

Finally consider calling your health authority. There are various deadlines for diagnostics and treatments and if they are being breached the central authority will want to know and push though those cases that have gone over.

The NHS is huge and complicated and things get lost, misfiled, etc all the time. Regular, polite, pressure on the bureaucracy can usually sort this out but may not happen overnight.

Several things:

* You didn't start saving early enough.  Sorry to be blunt, but that's how it is.
* You have high expectations.  As much as I wanted to live in the city centre of Oxford, I bought in the suburbs because I literally got twice the living space for the same price.  Make a choice about your priorities.
* You don't have a partner who can contribute to the costs.  Doesn't have to be a romantic partner - but that can certainly help :-)

It is.

Living in cheaper areas and commuting in to where there is work.

Your phone is flinging bits through the air over 2,000 times per second, using a transmitter about 0.5% as powerful as a lightbulb, through a great sack of water (you), and bouncing around all sorts of radio-reflective surfaces.  Frankly, it's a miracle[1] any of it works at all!

That said, there are some general tips which apply to any mobile operator...

* Restart your phone.  It's a computer and needs a little lie down once in a while.
* Update your phone's OS.  If you're using Android, flash the version specific to your operator - it will contain radio firmware designed to work with their transmitters.
* Clean the contacts between your SIM and the phone.  Little bit of isopropyl should do the trick.
* Ask for a SIM swap.  If your SIM card is old, it might be playing up.
* Try your SIM in a different phone - or put a different SIM in your phone to see who the culprit is.
* Report it to your operator.  They have a team of radio engineers looking for problems to fix - and they can't do that unless they know where the problems are.
* Check that your phone is set for both 2/3/4G - if it can't get a 3G signal, the call should fall back to 2G.

Best of luck!

I'd been told in no uncertain terms, several times, that if there was an accident *on no account admit liability*. They were very, very clear on this! (Tales of woe of previous transgressors who lost jobs etc...)

Driving on a tiny rural road, maybe a touch too fast round a bend, but nothing dangerous, simply didn't quite manage to stop in time... head on bump with a pleasant-enough couple of elderly tourists. No damage to either vehicle; scarcely a mark; of course, as I got out of the car, I didn't know this, and couldn't be sure they'd not make a fuss about a tiny mark on the paintwork! The ""accident"" was totally my fault: they'd seen me in time &amp; had completely stopped, I ran into *them*. 

Now: my *inclination*, like most people, was to simply apologise profusely, thank my lucky stars there's no damage, turn on the charm, have a nice chat and then drive off into the sunset. But because of this ""don't admit liability"" nonsense I ended up having to talk like a government minister on the Today programme, ""I see exactly what you mean... don't blame you for being upset..."" and so on.

Everything anyone says in conversation is the product of cultural activity and not the emanation of pure and original thought.

I've made a helpful diagram [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x96pbek5yqglxgl/Screenshot%202015-04-09%2011.12.18.png?dl=0), I mean, I'm open to your idea of how the fuck the orange car is doing anything wrong, because I find this case occurring more and more often, if you leave the correct amount of space between you and the car in front, someone will see it as a gap that should be driven into and dangerously undertake you to get there. 

Asside from tailgating the car in front, the only other thing the orange car could do is pull back left drive up to the back of the slow car and then indicate to pull out, however, that would at the very least either involve undertaking the car in front of him (which is against the highway code), and as he wants to overtake the car in the middle lane its also ridiculous to suggest that he should do such a thing, in fact that kind of lane wiggling would be almost certainly seen as dangerous my the majority of people.",null,0,null,1428573142,null,0,1428574856,0,cq6dpsd,null,t3_31rjsw,null,t1_cq6dpsd,null,t1_cq58zoe,null,null,null,1432286112,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

We're left with a middle ground of people not quite rich enough to support their kids, but not poor enough to benefit from the very restrictive level of financial support.

So the rich go to university as always.

The masses cannot afford to go, or do manage to scrape by somehow, and are landed with huge debt.

&gt;The plans were rejected on the basis that the bulk, height and detailed design of the new development “would be detrimental to the view from the adjacent Maida Vale Conservation Area and view from the nearby recreation ground where it was a gateway to the park.

&gt;Gary White, from Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, said: “Maybe they think by demolishing it they can get their planning permission through quicker.”

&gt;Maida Vale councillor Jan Prendergast added: “They do not have permission to do this. I am absolutely furious.

“The council will take very strong measures against them. It’s not safe and I’m appalled for the residents who live here.”

&gt;A council spokeswoman confirmed to the Times the demolition had taken place without permission and enforcement officers had attended the scene once they were alerted.

I've had it in the back of my mind for a long time now, was originally going to put it on in London last year, but that fell through. We pitched it to the Lyric about 2 months ago and we've been rehearsing since then.

And we didn't rehearse before we pitched it, no point in putting in all that work if they don't like it! Well we had some discussions about it, and talked about what we would like to do and the direction we would like to go it, but no real proper rehearsals.

As for where we rehearse, you can get space at the lyric, but it's quite costly, and we don't have any funding so it's all our own money going into this. So we've been rehearsing in Oisín's house, my house, my mother's back garden (where the rehearsal shots were taken... she's not too happy with her now stained sheets) and a meeting room in the office where Oisín has his day job.

The last one man show I did was probably more physically challenging - partly because it is a much longer show, but partly because I was in a lot worse shape than I am now. Not as draining mentally though. A Night in November is about a man coming to terms with his identity as a Belfast protestant and what that means. It's set during the 1994 world cup, and he wants to support the republic. So it deals with some heavy-ish themes of national identity and dissatisfaction in life, but it's presented in quite a comical fashion. I, Banquo however is a lot darker, and deals with much heavier themes like death and betrayal and ambition. That's not to say there isn't some comical moments, but overall it's a heavier piece which I find a lot more mentally demanding.

Of course it remains to be seen what will come of NI21 and if McCrea will seek reelection.

However you asked about the draw of the UUP to young people and I'll give a go of answering that.

I've always had an interest in politics and the our local unionists being UUP certainly helped, and the fact the DUP don't really exist down here, what little you seen of them wasn't great and I suppose my Dad didn't have much to say for them either, so I was never going to end up there.

I joined nearly three years ago and simply put I've enjoyed every bit of it, and the party leadership do quite like us now and do give us support, the YU is represented on more councils than the entire Alliance party, the success rate for YU candidates last year was about 85% or something.

Generally speaking the UUP is a broad house there are leftist elements, especially in some Belfast branches, Michael Copeland being a notable example, but these have largely been drowned out by the traditional backbone of the party. We had our spring conference recently and I nearly had a heart attack when we announced we wanted to raise the minimum wage, its not the sort of thing I expected us to do, we had an electoral pact with the Tories at the last GE. While there always was a left wing element, and I don't expect it nor want it to grow to much, it is healthy to have it there to temper and parry other elements within the party.

The concern for government is how much tax revenue and economic activity may be lost by having these people leave. This may have been substantial in the past. Today, loophole exploiters are less likely to leave and trade is easier so their leaving may not be a terrible thing. 

The problem for government policy is that the non dom fee brings in a lot of cash. Losing it would require noticable tax increases on everyone else. However, no one really has any idea how likely these people are to leave if they lose non dom status. Any change to the policy is pure guesswork.

I am not sure how they figure Britain does well for freedom of speech considering we don't have any. Offending people on the internet under your own name is effectively banned. Having 'terrorist reading material' gets you jailed. Refusing to disclose a password gets you jailed[1]. Plus our various stupid laws against porn the government doesn't like. Plus the chilling effect of knowing GCHQ is listening to every word you say online. I also recall the government forcing the Guardian newspaper to destroy its own laptops over leaked US information.

Freedom of assembly? We don't have that either, protests get banned all the time.

With toilets, public toilets can be really hard to find in many British cities. Surely quantity needs to count as well as quality.

One more gripe, Britain is astonishingly unfriendly to cyclists. It's worse than the USA. I wouldn't be surprised if that has an effect on obesity.

I understand that the NHS has to prioritise resources and have thresholds for who-needs-what, so fair enough, but I found it a bit frustrating that they'd basically acknowledged they were delaying an operation for procedural reasons. I am extremely glad I had it done earlier, it's made a huge difference. 

The private op was very good - rather impressed actually - but the doctor who did it told me he'd probably have been the one doing it on the NHS! (Just a year or so later...)

My impression was that the actual surgical / medical standards are basically the same (or should be). I'm not saying this is true of all ops in all circs, no doubt there are differences. 

At a private hospital you get a decent cup of coffee, carpets on the floor, and d'y'know that type of furniture that's actually quite cheap, but designed to look really posh? Lots of that. And a private room - in my case only for a matter of hours - which is like a very well-cleaned Travelodge. Having had a couple of overnights in NHS in the past, I must say I'd go for the private room given a choice! Staff were very nice, but in my experience the NHS lot are too, just much more overworked. 

My advice is: support the NHS politically for all you're worth. But if you need treatment quickly, and they're dragging their feet, go private if someone who can afford it will pay.

In fact all charts point to the fact that Labour spent most of its time fixing the shit that the Conservatives had broke in the entire time it was previously in power. Until the recession hit, the country was in a much, much better position than the the 1990s Conservative government.

HOWEVER, the recession was a banking crisis, brought on by excessive lending by the banks since the 2000s. Labour chose to deregulate the banks (with Conservative backing) thus creating the circumstances under which this lending could proliferate. Labour should have seen the increase in lending and decided ""hey, this could turn bad later, let's increase the regulations on lending"" rather than saying ""hey, banks are lending and this is bringing revenue, let's give them more power to lend"". This is something that Labour itself admits to, (as Miliband put it in his interview with Paxman ""We were wrong"").

Also, when the recession did hit, Labour stumbled quite a bit. Which is not good as this was the time when a firm plan was most needed (something the Conservatives offered).

Voting won't magically solve anything, no. Change in politics is a marathon, not a sprint and is not about instant change and gratification. Trying to make any changes, even within just a company, let alone on a national level is hard and slow, but just because the result of your vote isn't instant or noticeable doesn't mean it doesn't matter. You can become part of a change in the tide.

Consider the way our country was 100 years ago, then 200 years ago. Not everything that has changed is political, but we have, in that time gone from living under a dictatorship (monarchy) to having some semblance of democracy. This is mostly because people, collectively, over time, spoke up to make changes. Your vote is the easiest way to be part of this collective, gradual change without having to go too far out of your way to influence change.

The best way to use your vote is by getting yourself informed about policies of different parties and voting for what you most believe in and what fits most comfortably for you. If you want to do anything beyond that, it means taking more drastic action like starting your own party, becoming a politician, campaigning for issues you feel strongly about which is too much of a commitment for most people.

By not voting, you give up any chance of influencing the direction we go in. I know it can feel hopeless, but compare the UK to many other countries. Yes, our political system has serious issues, but the way our society is built, it means a majority can live in relative safety and comfort. In order to continue like that and make improvements we need the majority of us to be switched on, informed and active. 

Do a bit of research, don't be swayed by media bias and personality or appearances, look at the policies. Go and vote even when hopelessness creeps in.

I'm not saying people should be arrested for doing something that's not *technically* illegal, but it's pretty black and white that what they're doing is *not* what they're supposed to be doing.

All anyone is saying is that the loopholes that they take advantage of need to be closed, that's all. That is neither impractical or unethical.

Some of the episodes felt like they had to many cool ideas at once, not developing any of them enough.

Others felt as if they didn't have one good idea.

The pacing felt off for 3/4 of the episodes this season.

We either needed more Danny, or less. His characterization was 2-dimensional, and essentiallly he was there to be the girlfriend in the refrigerator to Clara.It didn't work, and what's more, showing his descendant makes his unltimate fate just confusing. If he had actually Taken part in some adventures and developed, I think people would have disliked him less, but instead, half of what we knew about his was told, not shown, and the other half was too in your face, and all of it was maybe five minutes per episode. Given that he was there to provide an alterantive to the doctor for Clara, it would have been nice to see them actually work together more, and good to see them in situations where he needs to act like the Doctor, or the Doctor needs to follow his lead, so they can come together and we can see what it is that Clara loves in both of them.

Also, If they want to make a big deal of how he was the love of Clara's life, I'd have liked to see more of that, since it felt like a really quick romance, and we didn't see most of it. Amy and Rory felt real because we saw them together, saw how they reacted to things together, and saw their relationship even when they were in the middle of Sontaran invasions.

The UK does fall harder in 2008 compared to others, but hardly out of line with what one would expect with the city of london. I may have poorly phrased my post there, but the 2008 GLOBAL financial crisis was not something the UK could have ignored in any case, and we would have been in for a recession regardless. Taking into account our large financial sector I'm tempted to say that a tory, libdem, SNP, green or UKIP government would have taken a pretty similar hit. It would be unreasonable to expect the government to predict something which no other major country saw coming and take evasive action. The ability to see the future is not something I see in any parties skillset. But between 2010-2012 growth is flatlined and we go into a recession, while other countries recover siginificantly better. Then austerity is loosened and the economy starts growing again.

As for the general prospects of an indy soctland, the total wipeout of oil prices just goes to show that predictions about the future only go so far. But I'd rather have a government trying to achieve the things I want to see and hampered by circumstance than one actively working against them. Sturgeon in the debate was, to my mind, making the points that labour should have been. 



I'd like to think the no vote was a sort of ""one more try"" type thing for the UK, which at least deserves that I hope.

They said they were going to refer me to the hospital to see a consultant so they could work out what was wrong with my insides!  At this point, I remembered I have full health care with work, so I called them up and they said I had 2 options, I could look at their site and find the doctor/hospital I wanted to use and they would arrange or they would just find the nearest/most suitable and come back to me with the appointment. 

They called me back within 30 minutes (I was still sat in the car at the GPs car park) and I had an appointment to see a doctor in 2 days.  2 fucking days!  Already pretty impressed. 

So I go along to the nearest Nuffeild hospital at about 5pm a few days later, doc talks to me does some tests and what not, sends me on my way with a note for my GP telling her to prescribe me something as a private prescription is normally much more expensive than an NHS one,.

Few weeks later nothing had really changed so he decides he wants me to go in for a small procedure.   Off I go, I had my own room, big en-suite bathroom, big telly, free wifi and just generally a bit more chilled out than at a normal hospital.   The food was also better, so I'm told but I can't remember last time I had hospital food before then. I've been back since for checkups and I'm certainly glad I did it. 

My doctor, like lots of private consultants are also NHS doctors (which is why I think all my appointment seem to be after 5pm) - and I've since met people he treats via the 2 local NHS hospitals and it seems the level of *medical* care I received at the private hospital wasn't any different from what I'd have had at the NHS place but the level of *service* care (for want of another word) was obviously better, they have more time for you - nothing is rushed. Simply because they have less patients to deal with I guess. 

I support the NHS unreservedly, I spent a month in hospital when I was 18 months old and there can be no doubt they saved my life.   Part of me felt guilty for going down the private route this time, but the way I see it is if that if the billion dollar multi national that I work for wants to pay for healthcare and I somehow take some of the burden off the NHS then alls good.",null,0,null,1428580134,null,0,false,0,cq6fgq2,null,t3_31zc9f,null,t1_cq6fgq2,null,t3_31zc9f,null,null,null,1432287004,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I pulled into Watford Gap for a Scottish burger and a car driver recognised I was a lorry driver. He asked why all the lorries were going past him, even supermarket ones, when he was doing 50, this was my explanation...   
  
My Speedo is calibrated every two years and is as accurate as a GPS one. Car speedos are calibrated at manufacture and not touched for the life of the car, sometimes they can be 10% off the true speed. I often follow cars who think they are doing 50 but are in fact doing 45.   

Assuming there is some truth to my argument it stands to reason that the 50~45 mph error also works the other way, ie 50~55 mph, I just don't notice these people as they are moving away from me.  This would mean speed cameras must have a similar tolerance built in to allow for this error.  

But the question is How accurate is your Speedometer? Have you checked it against a GPS system on your satnav? Until you know this you cant say whether you can go over the posted limit at all.    
    
As a final point, please don't go over the limit. I have driven 1000s of miles on UK roads for the last 20 years and seen too many cars twisted and broken with tarpaulins over them.

The Guardian is ""reliable"" in the way that things printed in it did happen, and the newspaper upholds pretty decent standards to prevent them publishing anything that is factually incorrect. However all the newspapers in the UK do have their own bias. So if you use the Guardian as a source, you need to remember it has a left wing bias, and maybe also review a more right wing source. The easiest way to do this would to find the same story in a right wing newspaper, like the times, and cite both sources for the information. That way you're saying ""I've looked at both left wing and right wing newspapers, and they say the same thing"".

I mean a good trio would be like the Guardian, an American right wing newspaper, and Al Jazeera or something non-western.

And maintenance on them is not either something we can do (we really can't) or something in the medium-long term.  The subs have to spend about 25% of their time in dock being worked on.  That's why we need 4 just to have 1 always at sea.  The recent refits took 3 years per sub.  Then just 6 month later one of them had to come back in because of a microscopic crack between the cooling and reactor flows.

They're marvels of engineering but when you max out killing power, reliability turns to shit.

So if we were to have a significant parting with the US, then we could still use them.  But for how long?  Likely only a year or two before they developed issues we are not able to fix.

This was the downside of us giving up our independent ability to make nuclear weapons and our shipyards.

We've agreed with the US to always consult NATO before using them and also to make them available for NATO (US) use as required.  We're also required to consult our NATO allies before using them and only use them for ""matters of supreme national emergency"", in fairness though, that should probably apply to nuclear weapons whether they're Made in the US or not.

null,false,AcaiPalm,lfc68,,null,"&gt;I have the ability to see past stats, they are just an easy way to **summarize** a players season especially when we are this far into it. 

But you haven't offered any stats at all to prove your points, you've just said that Lucas tackles and intercepts more and left it at that. If you want to use stats to prove your case then look at tackles and interceptions per game when either player was in the double pivot alongside Henderson. 

&gt;IIRC our 3-0 win over Tottenham was the first start Lucas was granted and not only did the defence look a lot more sturdy than it did against City (losing 3-1 that game) but Lovren had his first convincing performance with Lucas in front of him

Lucas didn't play in this game, didn't even come on as a sub. However Joe Allen did play and won the penalty when he made a run into the box and was pulled back by Dier. 

&gt;If we are playing either Allen or Lucas next to Henderson, Lucas shows our team to have a better all round defensive performance

Why? This statement is entirely subjective as it does not take into account the opposition, formation or who else was playing. If you're going to make such sweeping statements at least have some proof to back them up. 

&gt;I don't think the player roles of our midfield 3 are a holding role, playmaker role and a number 10.

Have you ever played in a 4-3-3 formation at any level of competitive football? 

&gt;When Henderson drops back and Allen moves forward he doesn't show much in way of creativity. Like you said he circulates possession well, but he can't find a killer pass unlike Henderson.

Henderson didn't play any 'killer passes' last night, he played a one two with Countinho but it hardly unlocked the defense. Arguably Allen should have won a penalty and also provided Henderson with a shooting opportunity when he played the ball into him in the middle of the box, but he decided to turn and look for another pass instead of shooting. As you've just said Allen and Lucas have mostly played alongside Henderson in the 3-4-3 this season, so why is it fair to expect Allen to be making killer passes and raking in the goals and assists when it's good enough for Lucas just to sit back and shield the defense? 

You keep on referring to a 'support' role for Lucas or Allen, but in reality each opposition requires a different skill set from the players you chose to play in the 4-3-3 midfield. Against a team such as Arsenal you could play Countinho in the 3 as the forward midfielder, but against other more physical opponents you require a more technical player who's more adept at protecting the ball and if the manager requires him to he can keep things simple and circulate possession. Having a variety of different central midfielders allows you to cater the system you use to address both the strengths and weaknesses of you opponents by utilizing the different players available at your disposal. Some games will require two defensively minded players who will not bomb forward at every opportunity but who will stay composed and circulate possession to keep the game tight. I can see that you are aware of the merits of having Joe Allen in the team at times, but you need to understand that just because he doesn't fit into your personal starting 11 on fifa doesn't mean he is not an invaluable player for the squad. You need midfielders who know how to read the game and understand what the manager wants to happen tactically during both the attacking and defensive phases. At the end of the day you starting XI depends entirely on how the manager wants to take the game to the opposition, so whether or not a player of Allen's ilk is required depends on who you're playing and how you want to play. To say as you did that Allen is '*a below average player'* because you don't fancy playing him consistently is ignorant.

I didn't 'pick on your comment'. You asked a question, I tried to provide some relevant information based on what I think is a fairly reasonable common use of the word ""permission"". The conversation only continued from there because you complained about two things I didn't actually say.

To recap, since it seems like otherwise we'll just slowly do it anyway:

1. You asked if they needed permission (note: not ""planning permission"", just ""permission"")
2. I said they needed to give notice
3. You asked how I knew they didn't do that and said demolition isn't a planning issue
4. I said I hadn't claimed either of those things and explained why I posted the link
5. You brought up an analogous situation
6. I explained why I thought the common use of the term ""permission"" was fairly reasonable, and why I posted the link
7. You appear to be confused as to why I posted the link in #2 and seem to think I'm attacking you somehow

I'm not going to say that private is wank, just that *some* of the points raised in here aren't quite true. 

I used to work in the admissions department of a private hospital. Basically, I would book people in and ensure that their insurer had agreed to cover them. Admin work. 


* The consultants: A lot of them also work in NHS hopsitals, directly for the NHS. Then they will have their private practice out of the private hospital. It's quite likely that if you were to have the surgery under the NHS, the surgeon quite possibly would have been the same person. 


* Money: For your money, you will most likely get your own room (which appeared quite nice) and a much nicer 'feel' to the hospital. The big plus for having your own room is the reduced risk of getting MRSA. However, the hospital 'charges' quite a bit for the exclusive rooms, charges that go straight to your insurer. Insurance companies would fight tooth and nail to get you out of there very, very quickly, or just change the scope of the procedure to out-patient and then you won't get a room at all. I saw a lot of people have to leave the same day as having relatively intrusive surgery.
Each day, I'd book about 50+ people in for appointments/surgery the next day and every day about 5 to 7 would be flat-out denied by their insurer for whatever reason. 
Side note: Believe it or not, some people never told their insurnace company that they wanted to see the consultant. They just assumed it'll all be covered. Only to discover the day before surgery is scheduled that the insurance company wasn't aware, doesn't agree and won't pay. Leaving the person to stump up the cash. BUPA aren't psychic.
I remember asking a consultant for the reason why he was booking in a lady to stay, as the insurance company on the phone wanted to know, he told me a 'reason' whilst doing a mimed pinnocchio nose. He obviously gets paid for providing the care.


* Drugs: The nurses told me that generally, you'd get the same drugs for treatment as you would on the NHS. One of the areas I saw where Private was better seemed to be Cancer drugs. I didn't realise just how expensive they were until I saw the print-outs for the insurance companies during a course of treatment. NHS doesn't appear to use some of the hyper-expensive (and I assume hyper-effective) cancer drugs simply because of the massive costs involved. We're talking almost hundreds of thousands per treatment for one case I saw.
So Private is definitely worth it if you have cancer. Although you'd need to have the cover before you get cancer though... I don't think an insurer would take you on *after* your diagnosis.


From the inside, it wasn't all shiny and perfect as it may seem. As you'd expect with private business, corners are cut in order to save pennies and management make business decisions over clinical decisions. It seemed quite undermanned (which seems like a general UK-Medical issue, god knows what we'd do without the migrant health workers propping it all up) and relatively under-trained compared to the NHS (subjective). A lot of the staff were ex-NHS and had a lot of experience under their collective belts though.


TL;DR: Private is OK, but don't assume it's a lot better than the NHS just because you paid a lot of money for it. Private it worth it for *some* treatments. Insurance companies will try their best not to pay too much though.

The average fracked well hasn't really improved that much in the last 3 years or so, at least if you check the data out of north dakota.  Besides which, the improved technology still costs more money, and hardly any shale drillers have a positive free cash flow, they're basically ponzi finance companies, to rob a term from Hyman Minsky.  The industry is built on a massive foundation of debt, which ain't ever getting repaid.

Anyway, production from the shale plays already looks to be either flattening or declining month-on-month, if you check the data coming out of north dakota and maybe texas (though their data is a pile of shit).  The eia's latest production data shows a 500kbpd into January dropoff from levels December.  Drillinginfo predict a [production plateau](http://info.drillinginfo.com/drillinginfos-us-oil-production-forecast/) starting about now.  Besides which, as with any system, there are lags.  If you run a rudimentary convolutional model using a standard average well profile and some estimates on drilling using current rig counts, then you can see that production will continue to climb for a while after rigs crash.  By the end of the year US production will either be in decline, or flat and on a drilling treadmill.  Unless of course you take the line that decreasing rigs will mean increasing production for some bizarre reason, the logical conclusion of which presumably means there will be infinite oil being produced when the last rig stops drilling.

I agree the eia are likely wrong regarding US production, but in my view they're optimism biased.

GMOs give us the molecular tools to actually save a population from an emerging pest/pathogen. If you want an example look at papaya in Hawaii. It was about to be wiped out (because they were all genetically very similar from artificial selection) and GMOs saved it. Could a GMO potato resistant for blight have not prevented the Irish potato famine, the result of an emerging pest on a low diversity species? Cavendish bananas, the most popular type, are literally all genetic clones of each other. This is clearly not an ideal situation but its a myth that GMOs are the cause of this, and they could very well be the solution. There is also no realistic alternative to monocultures of the most productive species given the increasing demand for food and dwindling resources to grow it.

So manufacturers make sure their speedo's read higher than the actual speed to make sure the driver is never in a situation of going faster than he thought he was.

It varies. I had a Honda which was pretty much 10% out at all times, so I could do 77mph on the motorway and my GPS would read 70mph. My wifes BMW is much more accurate and seems to be no more than 2-3% out regardless.

Also it's worth noting that GPS accuracy can also vary depending on the device you are using. Most consumer GPS devices I have used do not properly take into account your vertical speed so if you are driving on an incline then your speed reading will not be totally accurate, they are however vastly more accurate than speedo's assuming it has a strong clear signal.

What a fucking joke. A 200% rise because he is one year older yet still in full time education. The only difference in his circumstance is he is 17 and not 16 any longer.

Pretty disgusting if you ask me. Even more so learning that the Mancs down the road have a sensible(ish) pricing structure in place.

Its vile that they ask for the sum to be in such sort notice too, like all supports get paid x amount of thousands per week. We are not fucking footballers, we the fans, whom without us the Club would not exist.

The house is cheap so they can afford the mortgage easily and still make savings. After a few years they have some money saved up and want to make a safe investment that will go up in value. so they mortgage house 1, buy a new house and rent house 1. Overtime they repeat the process. After a duration depending on their salary and(+how much house maintenance they handled personally to save money) their rent profits mean they no longer need to work they just keep buying houses every few years. How far they want to take it depends on the person. they could retire at 5 houses or keep doing it until they have 100. Now comes generation rent, a house that cost £20000 25 years ago is now likely to cost over £100000. When a full time minimum wage job earns about £13000 a year. Getting accepted for a bank loan is unlikely so you must rent. The money which would have been paying your mortgage is now going to a landlord.

I know the Sahara very well, and its interesting to see the wind patterns at this time of year.  Basically I guess what is happening is the areas of high wind (the green bits) are sitting over areas of [Reg \(stony desert\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_pavement).  At this time of year, they start to heat up more in the sun than the sandy areas, causing loads of convection and pulling in cooler air from Europe and the Med causing the wind patterns.  At higher levels the winds will then carry dust all over the place including the UK and South America.

These wind patterns I guess show the end of the [Harmattan season](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmattan) when the winds run South over West Africa until the desert heats up again as its starting to do now and takes everything East over the Atlantic.

We did the torpedoes and, I think, the reactors!  Pretty much everything else is import though :(

Likely Trident two will be 100% import since we really have not been active in reactor design or any of the other tech (especially the weapons) for ~25 years...

null,false,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,null,"Lucas and Allen have had similar game time. Lucas 14 starts, Allen 13. Both just over 1,000 minutes. (Allen has played about 100 minutes more). Tackling, Lucas makes 4.1 per games and intercepts 1.7 per game. Allen makes 2 tackles per game and 1.4 interceptions. They have both played in the double pivot next to Henderson and they have both played DM according to whoscored.com. In terms of overall performance Lucas has a rating of 7.04 next to Henderson and Allen has a 6.72. This position is meant to suit Allen more might I add as Lucas is preferably a Defensive midfielder in the single pivot. Onto the single pivot or Defensive midfield role Lucas has an overall rating of 7.4 and Allen 6.98. Lucas has outperformed. I imagine you'll say something about the quality of opposition improving. If Allen can't perform well against teams such as Tottenham and Southampton who are our equals at the moment, then he isn't good enough to start for us. Lucas played against teams lower in the table and performed well. Allen has played against higher opposition and has an average rating when it comes playing next to Henderson. 

The stats now show we have a better defensive player when we have Lucas next to Henderson. Lucas' run in the team coincided with us gaining 5 away clean sheets in a row.

Henderson had the assist last night and the one two he played with Coutinho was a killer pass. The pass allowed Coutinho 3 unanswered touched in the opposition box and a shot that was barely challenged. Only one blocker was infront. Even if you don't consider that a killer pass, Henderson has shown the capability of providing a great pass. 
 
Onto the 4-3-3. No I haven't played competitive football. However I can look at a screen and recognise that at no point did Allen or Henderson play NO.10 last night. I know you need a variety of players that perform different tasks. Just because you're articulate doesn't mean you have said anything out of the ordinary. "" Against a team such as Arsenal you could play Countinho in the 3 as the forward midfielder, but against other more physical opponents you require a more technical player who's more adept at protecting the ball and if the manager requires him to he can keep things simple and circulate possession. Having a variety of different central midfielders allows you to cater the system you use to address both the strengths and weaknesses of you opponents by utilizing the different players available at your disposal."" This can be shortened to we need a different kinds of midfielders for different teams. I understand an Allen ""Type"" player can be useful to the team, there are players that are better (obviously) than Allen who can play in a 3 man midfield and they can ""circulate possession"" and put in a good defensive performance.

This comes up in the press from time to time when people try to demand a specific drug and are refused. As I understand it there is a committee/board that decides on if drugs should be considered for NHS use and cost is only a small part of the consideration. Biggest issue with many of the, very expensive, cancer drugs is that they are NOT ""hyper-effective"" at *saving lives*. They may well extend life, possibly for many months, but only at massive cost and the quality of life for that period may be very poor. As such they are not supplied on the NHS, but as costs decrease and/or they are found to be potentially useful in combination with other drugs the situation can be reconsidered.

Not sure I agree there, but may be location specific. I know many people who have been treated for cancer in London and the South East on the NHS and generally the treatment has been very good.

There are quite reasonable questions around whether long term use of psychoactive drugs is better for the child than simply being disruptive. 

You also need to consider the environment we've created, outside of class kids have access to the most engaging and interactive tools ever created (phones, games etc). Then we put them in an impossibly dull classroom with little to do and act surprised when they ""misbehave"". 

I don't think many people are disputing that ADHD exists, but do we believe that 11% of kids have a serious mental illness? That's the figure of prescription use in some parts of the states - http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/22/adhd-diagnoses-rise-to-11-of-kids/

And then you compare the US to France who have less than 0.5% with ADHD, that is a huge variance. It comes down to how ADHD is treated, whether it is with drugs that weren't tested on children and come with a tonne of side effects, or something that can be treated in a more holistic fashion. 

""French child psychiatrists, on the other hand, view ADHD as a medical condition that has psycho-social and situational causes. Instead of treating children's focusing and behavioral problems with drugs, French doctors prefer to look for the underlying issue that is causing the child distress—not in the child's brain but in the child's social context. They then choose to treat the underlying social context problem with psychotherapy or family counseling. This is a very different way of seeing things from the American tendency to attribute all symptoms to a biological dysfunction such as a chemical imbalance in the child's brain.""

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"I never said it doesn't, but you're delusional if you think that training compares to a real game. No matter how tough the manager works the players, it doesn't compare. The intensity isn't the same, there's much less pressure, players may get way more touches than in a real game, there's really no threat of injuries because everyone is on the same team, etc. 

Some players can excel playing in limited minutes every few weeks, but most don't. Which of our subs have had anything but mediocre seasons? Cech and Remy? Cech makes sense since he's a keeper and I love Remy because it's amazing how he does it (especially with all the times he got screwed out of apps due to Drogba as much as I love the legend). You could argue Zouma, but he had a couple of whole games starting to incorporate himself. Mikel, Ramires, Drogba, Schurrle, Cuadrado, Salah and Luis have all been mostly poor/mediocre. 

This isn't some Chelsea issue. How many bench players are other top clubs are always in top form as a sub? Most aren't. The other top teams have useful subs because they rotate to. You say we need only those players who can do so, but that's unrealistic. Other top clubs don't magically find these players, they take risks by giving less proven or out of form players chances because it helps down the line in an important fixture where it pays to take off a starter who's been poor for a sub that can actually be useful.

My argument really isn't specifically about Salah because I never rated him  highly in the first place. He's fast, but not the best dribbler and his end product needs work. It's for players like Cuadrado and Schurrle who the fans on here viciously criticize and attack, like it's their fault they can adjust playing occasionally as a sub or in cup fixtures. It's also about the youth, which don't even get a chance. If we want to reach the levels of Barca, Real and Bayern, we have to take risks incorporating out of form/new/youth players. No Chelsea will ever break into this first team with our current rotation policy, unless they have a crazy loan spell. 

Don't act like it's a Chelsea thing because Barcelona, Real, Bayern, United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs, Dortmund, PSG are other top clubs who take risks with youth products or ""bench"" players. The only one that compares to us are City with how they don't give their youths many chances, but they at least rotate much better.",null,0,null,1428587990,null,0,false,0,cq6ipdt,null,t3_31s21b,null,t1_cq6ipdt,null,t1_cq6fjht,null,null,null,1432288531,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

If we put out oil production at evens, they're way ahead in combined oil and gas. Theres also the fact we're currently a net importer of hydrocarbons.

Obviously half a trillion quid would be useful to the UK, but we don't have it lying around because we have 12x the population to look after with a smaller income from it.

Edinburgh has had an American Football team since the Edinburgh Eagles were formed in 1985. Playing until 1988, they achieved success, becoming the Borders Conference champions in 1987. They subsequently merged with the ‘Capital Clansman’ team in 1989 to form the Edinburgh Phoenix who posted a 22-17 record in the British leagues over the next 4 years. A different Eagles team played in 1993 and 1994 before the Lothian Raiders played in Saughton and Dalkeith from 1996 until 1998. Edinburgh was without a senior amateur team between 1998 and 2003, although the Scottish Claymores played in the city at Murrayfield until 2002.[1]

The Edinburgh Wolves were originally formed in 2002 by a group of eight people who had previously played Flag Football. The Wolves name was adapted from the flag team which was absorbed into the organisation at the same time.[2] The club quickly expanded, and were accepted into the British Senior League in November 2002. The League was rebranded to the British American Football League (BAFL) in 2005. The club moved to the BAFA Community League in 2010 after BAFL went into administration.

Personally, and perhaps im putting too much faith in my species here, i feel it is perfectly reasonable and easy to understand that an item of headwear must not obscure any part of the face, and that any such photos will be rejected at the applicants expense. In the long run people will learn not to risk it with anything that isn't absolutely innocuous, lest they have their application disrupted with unnecessary administrative headaches. Same way they do with their glasses. 

If the headgear obscures absolutely nothing but the hair and upper forehead, it cannot possibly impede identification. Furthermore there any many personal effects which are entirely allowed which are FAR more significant in their disruption of identification.

For example how is this:
http://leblow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Peace-beanie-hat-Urban-Outfitters.jpg

more obstructive than this:
http://cdn.sheknows.com/filter/l/gallery/jennifer_lopez_5.jpg

Anyway, i am digressing from the main thrust of the point.

That being that the degree of certainty of identity produced by a photograph of a woman in a hijab must be sufficient for the DVLA to be satisfied it will not call into question the integrity of the document. Otherwise compromise or not they simply wouldnt issue the document. Because that WOULD call into question its integrity. 

If, as you say, the standard of identification that is achievable is higher for a person not wearing a hat, which i would find very questionable but lets assume for a second you are right - Why exactly SHOULD i be held to a higher standard than others?

If that standard is acceptable for others, it should be acceptable for me.

Now, i know very well the argument you are going to try here is going to be some spurious comparison with demographics that by NECESSITY have different standards applied, children for example, but i will make it very clear right now, that is bunk. You know it. I know it. 

There is no element of NECESSITY for that higher standard applied to non-hijab wearers. Its saving what? 5 seconds of uncertainty at the roadside while he takes a second look? And thats assuming you even look like your photo to begin with. Im 7st lighter than i was when i had my driving license photo taken. You can be damn sure i get some funny looks. Having a cap on would have been the least of their worries. 

If you want to go down that road of that TINY bit of additional certainty being paramount enough to infringe on peoples rights for, then i suggest we stop issuing 10 year driving licenses, and reduce the renewal period to make sure people actually resemble their photos year on year. To suggest one without the other would be ludicrous.

Labour will scrap the non-dom rules that exempt thousands of British residents from UK tax on their offshore income without any clear idea of how much it will raise — or lose — for the Exchequer, experts said on Wednesday.
Stuart Adam, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think-tank, said: “We have very little idea about the revenue implications of Labour’s proposals. The thing we know least about is how people are going to respond to a tax rise.”


The Institute of Directors also stressed uncertainty over Labour’s costings, describing the economics as “unconvincing”.
Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: “It’s very unclear what additional revenue would be raised, but the UK’s international reputation would be put at risk.”
Some individuals were quick to voice their objections. One former non-dom who has now left the UK said he used to pay more than £2m of taxes to the UK. He pointed to the “many very attractive alternatives for wealthy non-doms, many of whom can and will leave if attacked”.


Another said: “I wake up every morning and it seems that the solution to the UK’s problems is to tax me more.”
More is known about non-doms than at the time of the last big debate on the issue in 2008 because of the introduction of an annual charge for long-stay non-doms.


But the complexity of the rules and the paucity of information in the public domain make any estimates highly uncertain, leading some pundits to stress other aspects of the measure such as its impact on fairness.
The Conservatives questioned the reliability of estimates put forward by Jolyon Maugham, a QC who provided some help to Labour in drawing up its policy. His “finger in the air” estimate concluded that scrapping the non-dom rules would result in a yield “well north of £1bn”. Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner, said that Mr Maugham’s estimate was similar to his own.

Graham Aaronson, another leading tax QC, described Labour’s policy as “economic folly”, arguing that the losses to the Exchequer could be sizeable. He said the UK would “unquestionably” lose out because people would no longer choose to set up their businesses in the UK. It would also lose as wealthy and high-spending individuals from places such as Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Hong Kong decided to spend less time in Britain, he said.

Emma Chamberlain, a QC with experience of advising non-doms, also expressed doubts. “Clearly, there are abuses but the risk is we throw the baby out with the bath water. The danger is it will put people off from coming here in the short term.”
Ms Chamberlain believes the new charge will not raise much, if any, money from the short-stay non-doms. Nearly nine out of 10 of the 46,700 non-doms who use the remittance basis — just paying tax on offshore income when it is brought into the UK — leave within seven years of arriving in the UK. “Such people are either going to just leave earlier or not come in the first place,” she said.

If Labour opts to restrict the period in which offshore income is untaxed by the UK to just a few years, it will discourage wealthy and entrepreneurial immigrants, she said.


In addition, there are at least 70,000 long-stay foreign domiciliaries who do not use the remittance basis but who benefit from offshore trusts, according to Ms Chamberlain. These may include “some of the least meritorious domicile claims” but stopping these breaks would be difficult because of the constraints of EU law.
She said that if the tax breaks of this group were removed, a third of them might leave but she stressed it was impossible to say with any certainty. In addition, she said it would be very easy for people already resident abroad to avoid becoming UK residents while still spending up to 120 days here. “Then they will be unaffected by the changes but we won’t get the same benefit of their families spending here and inward investment with head offices here.”


The tax regime for wealthy non-doms has tightened in recent years, with the remittance charge increasing this month. For those who have lived in the UK for 12 out of the past 14 years, the annual levy has increased from £50,000 to £60,000, and a new levy of £90,000 has been introduced for those who have lived here for 17 out of 20 years.


Overseas tax residents now also face paying capital gains tax on the sale of UK properties, although this will only apply to gains made above values from April 2015.
However, since the annual remittance charge was first introduced in 2008, official figures indicate that the number of non-doms electing to pay tax on this basis has barely fallen.


George Bull, senior tax partner at accountants Baker Tilly, said he did not believe that Labour’s policy would lead to an exodus of wealthy non-residents. Of the minority of non-doms who would be affected, it will probably only be those who are not working in the UK who will leave the country, Mr Bull said. He added that for most executives, their employers will pick up the extra tax bill.

i learned: 

1. the squad is young and still inexperienced. but they are learning. you don't go on a 13 match unbeaten run in the premier league without having high quality. also the run they went on from the palace game through to arsenal last week was incredible, i think it was like 4 losses in 25 matches? 

2. we have serious character. we truly turned our season around in the face of crisis. that bodes well for the future of this squad when facing adversity, tough matches when we are down. the game against palace in the fa cup stands out as a phenomenal performance because of how we responded going down a goal, almost 2.

Plenty of people buy on some sort of finance. I'd recommend it in a lot of cases, as it allows you to purchase a brand new car with commensurate peace-of-mind. It's a great way of getting reliable wheels without stumping up a huge lump sum, and some cars can be had for no (or at least very low) deposit.

I just don't think Origi is the answer as far as this goes.  First, he'll be barely 20 years old, pretty much still a kid, and to put that much responsibility on his shoulders would be brutal.  Second, he's played more as a winger or second forward than an out and out striker for most of his career.  He played up top for Belgium in the World Cup, but it's not really his primary role (yet... I think we're going to use him up there and develop his game as a striker, but he'll be very raw as a striker for a while as he learns the ropes better).  Third, he's never been prolific in his career so far (youth or senior).  His 7 goals for Lille this season include Penalties (which he's missed 2 of this season) and 3 of them came in 1 game, so he's hardly scoring regularly from open play.

Is there a good reason why Members should be exempt from having performance indicators applied to them when they and government departments are so fond of using them for their own purposes ?

We are adding a different perspective  one that people don't need to understand the whole political process and language to grasp- the majority of voters &amp; non voters that we researched when asked what the expected their MP to do for them, answered to turn up in Westminster and vote on their behalf. 

We have received comments from some MPs that far from being divisive and unhelpful, some of the aggregated and average information we provide is something they, themselves have never been shown before. The differences in office running costs alone between MPs in neighbouring constituencies can be very thought provoking.

Yes you can have that situation and then on the other side you have those that in the main parties who are so whipped that they sometimes don't know what they are voting on but are told which lobby door to go through.

I don't disagree here, but I think that that is more due to inaction on politicians to change the system, rather than my efforts not being effective enough.

&gt;You are far more likely to actually get change you want by either spoiling your ballot, or voting for a fringe party who actually stand for what you want.


Proof?

Here is the thing I feel. Both spoiling your ballot and not voting are both done to prove more or less the same point, and both have the same track record.

The only difference is that not voting requires less effort.

I think voter turnout is cared more about than spoiled ballots, as spoiled ballots are lumped in together with those people who are spoiling their ballot because they are idiots, or those who spoil their ballots because they don't understand how to vote.

The alternative was forming a coalition with Labour, which would have resulted in a dangerously slim majority and reliance on support from other minority parties.

&gt;I honestly wouldn't have cared if the Lib Dems had sat their and said to the conservatives ""no fuck you"" every time they came up with a ridiculously conservative policy and then the government got nothing done

All the Conservatives had to do if the Lib Dems so much as started looking at them wrong was call it all off, dissolve parliament and call another election which they almost certainly would have won. 

At the end of it all, both parties had to make compromises in order to make things work. The Tories wanted to fully implement the Browne Review and remove tuition fee caps altogether. In fact, if we're going to be sticklers about the tuition fee deal, the Lib Dems actually cut students a pretty good one - with the bargain-basement interest rate and increase in repayment threshold many people will end up either paying less or not paying anything at all. In return for that, the LDs got all their constitutional reforms like AV - something that had never even been mentioned in the Lib Dem manifesto, but nobody started losing their shit over that - even if they did all fall flat on their faces.

When parties enter a coalition agreement, all pre-election promises, pledges and other posturing go out the window and they start from scratch merely use their manifestos as a starting point for further negotiation. You can say that is wrong and goes against their mandate - and it probably does - but that's just the way our political system works at the moment.",null,0,null,1428592479,null,0,false,0,cq6lcmn,null,t3_31vdi7,null,t1_cq6lcmn,null,t1_cq6h5jv,null,null,null,1432289779,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

But less so for the prices themselves being high - imo that's more a consequence of the monetisation of football and clubs becoming businesses, rather than any outright greed within the sport. If anything the ticket prices are a lot lower than they could be considering how quickly and reliably the games sell out. There are very few products with such high demand that their waiting lists span several years, and they usually see pretty extortionate price inflation as a result. Expensive sports cars don't cost hundreds of thousands because that's what it costs to make them, they cost that much because that's what some people are prepared to pay and supply is limited anyway.

The point is the debt is still a debt, whatever way you try to spin it.

£9000 is a lot more than £3000. Triple, in fact. Would you believe it?

An incentive on the old scheme was paying back early, so you could forget about that debt and actually get on with life. Yes, we were all told student debt wouldn't be taken into account for loans and mortgages, but guess what? The banks lied! They said it will, and it does. Tough luck, students. 

Now under this new system, paying off that debt is risible. To even attempt so by getting a better salary is counterproductive - you end up paying even more! My degree is four years so I am lucky to have even more debt that your average troika-student, and I will have roughly £54,000 to pay back before any interest is added :D

I do indeed find the NL way of living very desirable. People seem to just get on with each other; partly because of how the cities are designed but also because there is less inequality and therefore less resentment and arrogance, as I see it.

Right, this appears to be the crux of it. I don't especially disagree with your assessment, although as you later admit, you didn't seem to think that was my intent. 

&gt; I know that it wasn't your intent to insult or offend anyone, and you didn't, but I needed to hip whatever you're saying in the bud because OTHER peope will read into you being harassed by women as the situation all being fair and equal. And it's not.

To some extent, maybe you need to give others more credit than you're seemingly giving them. Just because someone provides an example of another group being subjugated it doesn't remove the validity of other claims. I mean, why would it? 

I simply tire of gross generalisations when the world is littered with nuance, which likely provoked my initial response. 

I know intimately that women are often treated worse. I was with my fiancee in Sri Lanka and there is no question whatsoever that she had it significantly worse than I did both in terms of severity and regularity. But there were also situations that were challenging for me, and it doesn't hurt anybody to recognise that. 

Two people sharing a common problem shouldn't be a cause for competition but instead for collaboration, shared understanding and a common enemy. 

Ultimately, I don't think it is always that helpful to divide people on the basis on their genitalia (thus the cock comments). We are stronger together even if we face different issues. A man can be a victim of domestic violence just as a woman can, it generally happens more to women, but it doesn't remove the fact that men being victims of domestic violence is a problem we want to solve.

IIRC the original pylons were designed around classical Greek and Roman structures (obelisks etc). The HV link between Sheffield and Manchester over the Pennines is one of the most unsung bits of infrastructure engineering ever know in the UK. It was tremendously complex and bloody hard work given site access and tools of the time. 

If it's ever on again I thoroughly recommend watching it.

As for the structure I agree with most of the comments here, it is a good looking bit of kit. A lot less obtrusive than the originals. I wonder if they are made of GFR composites rather than metal? This seems to be the logical choice for a pylon structure with it being tremendously strong and a damn good insulator.

&gt;The __availability heuristic__ is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision_making) operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled.  Subsequently, under the availability heuristic people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

Every tuesday I go to a pub to play DnD. 

I leave my office in Hammersmith, and get on the tube to go into central London. The Tube that was built 100 years ago and 60 years ago it was being used to shelter people from air raids.

I get off the tube either at Bank and walk past the Bank of England  (1848) or I get off at Monument and walk past the Monument to the Great Fire of London (1671). 

The pub I go to used to be a banking hall (don't know when the building was built but it was a while ago). Last time I stepped out of the tube at Monument, I could hear the bells of St Pauls (1675) (I think it was St Pauls).

The other day I went to an interview and stepped of the Tube at Tower Bridge, and walked past the Tower of London (1078) and past Tower Bridge (1886) to go into the modern all glass and steel office building.

Even outside of London you frequently come across things that are so incredibly old, you sort of don't think about it. I think it's a lot harder to impress British people with historical things than it is Americans. I imagine if I go to the US I may get told about things 100-200 years ago, but I've seen things dug up by farmers that are over 2,000 years old. Literally dug up by some guy in a tractor.

In my case I was 38 when the cataracts were diagnosed, &amp; working full-time, obviously. The NHS said that allowed them to bump me up the list as I was treated as a higher priority than retired people. Even so, because they evaluate the need for an operation on each eye separately, I would have had to wait ~6months for the first operation, then unknown wait for the second op while the other eye deteriorated to the point they'd do it on the NHS. Which would have been OK, except for my quite bad shortsightedness!

The NHS treatment *would* have fixed that too, but in one eye at a time, with my (former) level of myopia, this would have caused me real problems, specifically having to wear a contact lens in the other eye during all waking hours, or else having my eye fixed with another shortsighted one!

Having exited university for the second time recently, I find the job market for grads/junior white professionals to be better, but still not even remotely as good as before the recession. We've kept unemployment down but at the expense of quality and pay. People are working harder than ever for less - we're out of the crisis but the overworking that people did to avoid redundancy during the recession has become the norm and salaries have not caught up. And no wonder, because competition for decent jobs is as strong as ever. I'm going through a couple of hiring processes now where HR are overwhelmed by applications. The market is clearly awash with a backlog of graduates built up over the past five or six years of lean times.

&gt; Compare that to a flat stony broke student entering Uni now, with the prospect of leaving with a debt something like three times greater than mine, and with much more financial pressure on them, what with higher rents, higher cost of living, flat economy and hardly any postgrad job prospects.

First criticism stems from the first sentence. Tuition fees are capped at £9k/year, not £9k/term.

You make the entirely accurate point that fees are not a lump and should not dissuade students from lower income families. University education is *free* at the point of access, with loan repayments on a pay-when-you-can basis for those who are actually earning.

I'm glad to see some people are making that point since many others prefer to paint it as though you can't afford to go to uni unless your parents have £30k+ in the bank to support you, which goes beyond political ideology and clear into the realms of fantasy (and lies).

I do however take serious issue with this statement:

&gt; Far fewer people went to university, and those who did tended to be very rich. Higher education was the prerogative of the wealthy, and considered completely out of the question for many of the poorest people.

Many of the richest would have gone to university. They would have been to private school and it would have been expected of them to go and study something (if they weren't going to Sandhurst to join the army!).

However, it was NOT the prerogative of the wealthy. That's utter bollocks. University used to be *properly free* for users. My parents both went (having got into grammar school), and aside from the absence of tuition fees, both received maintenance *grants* for their living expenses!

The reason far fewer people went was not because of cost, but simply one of expectations. For the son of a coal miner or steel worker, the notion of going to university was so far out of their perspective that they wouldn't have even considered it - they'd have joined their father at work when they turned 16. And of course under the Grammar/Comprehensive system, Comprehensive students took vocational qualifications and were introduced to the trades. They weren't offered A-levels and thus would have struggled to apply to university even if they wanted to. Conversely, grammar school students would have almost been expected to go to uni - regardless of their parent's backgrounds. The system was based on merit.

There has always been social mobility though. My favourite case is that of Sid Watkins. Born the son of a coal miner, he excelled at school, went to university to study Medicine and ended up as Chief Surgeon/Medical Advisor for the FIA for more than 25 years. Probably the only boy in his class not to follow his father's lead!",null,0,null,1428594973,null,0,false,0,cq6myxk,null,t3_31x47d,null,t1_cq6myxk,null,t1_cq5s8n2,null,null,null,1432290612,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The University was established in 1209, so everywhere I look there's a beautiful old medieval building of some sort or other.

You do not have to vote. Parties do not have any official information on whether you voted or who you voted for. However, they do collect their own data on these things.
 
Candidates for elections get a copy of the electoral register - they know everyone in the area who is registered to vote. They try to speak to all these people - or at least, the ones in their target wards - in order to gauge their views. When people knock on your door in the run up to an election, they are rarely trying to actually convince you to vote for them. Normally they are just looking for their supporters. We actually brief people to avoid arguments and long discussions, unless the voter wants to get into it. Otherwise, we get the data and leave them alone.
 
Her party will have previously canvassed you and for some reason they put you down as one of their supporters. Clearly at some point they thought you were one of them (either because you said so to a person at your door or on the telephone, or because someone in your house told them you supported them, or maybe something like an email campaign that you responded to).  
 
This next bit is called ""getting the vote out"". It is an absolutely critical part of winning an election.
 
On polling day, party activists (normally the older ones who can't do as much walking) will stand or sit outside all the polling stations and politely ask people for their electoral numbers. Nobody has to hand them over but there's no harm in it. They make a note of which of their supporters have already turned up to vote and who is yet to do so. Throughout the day, they target their resources on those who are their supporters who have not voted. That's why the woman came knocking for you. When someone turns up at a polling station, or says they have voted, they get crossed off the list. 
 
The next time a canvasser appears at your door, tell them you do not want to support them and they will leave you alone. I expect you have already been put down as a non-supporter because of the last time they tried to get you out. For this reason I expect you have nothing to worry about. 

For what it's worth, some people appreciate that their vote is valued by the parties courting it. They don't see why they should vote if nobody bothers to make the effort to reach out to them. Some also appreciate the reminder to vote on polling day, which for us is a rare and special event that only happens every four or five years years (plus local elections and by-elections), but to them is just another busy Thursday.",null,0,null,1428595649,null,0,1428596024,0,cq6nf32,null,t3_31wktz,null,t1_cq6nf32,null,t3_31wktz,null,null,null,1432290824,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

""The larger question raised by the war was whether surface fleets were still worthwhile in the face of missiles like the Exocet that sank HMS Sheffield. It did not help that the British destroyer, which was smaller and in many ways less capable than U.S. frigates, had been advertised before the war (by the British) as the epitome of modern naval power. The main accepted lesson seems to have been that several British ships were devastated because their aluminum superstructures burned or melted. The upshot was that the new U.S. Arleigh Burke class, designed after the war, had steel superstructures. Many unfortunately associated that one feature with survivability. The Burkes are indeed highly survivable ships, as the experience of USS Cole later showed, but that was due to a lot more than steel superstructure construction – which in itself would hardly have been enough.""

null,false,frugilegus,null,null,null,"As others say, it's not really something that directly impinged day-to-day, but I think it's quite core to the British sense of identity. There's a sense of continuity of history that's quietly reinforced by the centuries old pubs, churches, castles and other buildings and ruins that surround us.

We often mock American's saying ""I'm Irish"" when they mean ""one of my grandparents came to the US from Ireland"". It's because that's an utterly alien way of expressing identity to us. Our identity is much more rooted in the history of the country and the architecture and man-made landscape that surrounds us and constantly reminds of that history. 

Obviously, the dark side of that is the blood-and-soil nationalism that uses the historical continuity to reject the idea that any immigrants could have British identity. (That idea is shallow, and ignorant of how immigration over the years has been absorbed into the British identity, subtly changing it each time and influencing the culture and the architecture. Continuity isn't the same as stasis, ""change is the only constant"" to misquote Heraclitus.)

There's something quite special about being able to visit 5000 or more years of people living here; from the neolithic at Skara Brae,  through bronze-age, iron-age, Roman, Saxon, Mediaeval and early modern buildings; with a knowledge that there wasn't a sudden moment of complete change. There have been waves of migration and invasion, but none that entirely swept away all that happened before it.

&gt;Lucas' run in the team coincided with us gaining 5 away clean sheets in a row

It also coincided with moving to three at the back (yes an extra centreback) and Gerrard being injured and no longer being played in the pivot with whoever else was unlucky enough to have to play with him.  You keep saying that Lucas is the best DM we have, and he probably is statistically better but a lot of that is down to his lack of mobility. He doesn't get around the pitch as much to pressure opponents and occupy space so he needs to make more tackles to counteract that.

All I can do is advise you to re-watch the game, but this time don't follow the ball like a pinball and actually look at the positioning of the players. 

&gt;there are players that are better (obviously) than Allen who can play in a 3 man midfield and they can ""circulate possession"" and put in a good defensive performance

But Joe Allen can do much more than that, he is one of the most tactically astute players in our squad and he can play any of the center midfield positions we need. If you play in that second holding mid or midfield play-maker role you don't need anything more than Allen gives you because you have 4 forward to go and get you goals.

Overall, there really isn't anything about it that's better than the NHS system. In the town I'm in, no GP practices that were in our insurance network were taking on new patients, so we had to register at a practice in a town 20 minutes away. On my first visit, I requested some blood work done, which they obliged to. My GP wrote an order for the work that I then had to go to my local hospital to schedule an appointment for myself. For that act alone at the GP's office, I was charged $240 which I had to pay there and then, to be later reimbursed by my insurance (I got $190 back).

I then scheduled the tests, which I couldn't take for at least a week due to them being booked up. Doing them was easy enough, though the procedure started ten minutes later than the scheduled time because they were busy. For the blood work to be done, etc, that cost me another few hundred out of pocket, to be reimbursed later on by the insurer. I was told to wait two weeks for contact regarding the test results (they would just tell me they're ready for pick up). No call ever came, I had to manually chase it up, and then go to pick them up.

We have pretty good insurance, not the best, but good. Even then, co-pays for dentist visits runs high, you always have to be careful that you're going to a place that's in your insurer's ""network"", and for more serious (read: expensive) things there's no guarantee your insurer won't wriggle out on a technicality.

Overall, I really miss the NHS. It's not perfect, far from it, but it does it far better than the US. That, and there is always the option of private, if you can afford it.

While what you say about expectation is true, the facts are pretty stark and I do think that the fees have played a part in changing attitudes towards university. As I say in the article: 

&gt;In England, disadvantaged teens were 70% more likely to go to university in 2013 than in 2004.

Of course, this has largely been a result of changes in the system, but the way that university fees work have also meant that universities are able to accept more students, and by extension, more students from less privileged backgrounds.

Rejigging the layout means having two tiny, crappy bedrooms and one normal one. 

Our house has been neglected as a rental property for years, rotten floor joists, a poor quality extension, patio higher than the air bricks. The list is endless. The house has been exposed to times when there were no building regulations (the 1970s!!!). The amount of money that has to be ploughed into buildings like that just to bring them up to a reasonable standard is ridiculous, let alone trying to make them efficient. 

I agree that a lot of modern properties have been poorly built, small windows, hermetically sealed, small rooms, no storage, built on ugly estates, but at least in theory we have the know how to make some magnificently practical and efficient homes. If someone turned round tomorrow and said they wanted to get rid of all homes over 100 yrs old and build some awesome efficient ones instead, I wouldn't feel at all sentimental about losing old houses.

Now granted, when I say the writing also went down, that's my opinion, but the actual mechanics of making a visual product are not subjective. They are completely measurable if you know how to look at it. 

And another clarification, the drop in quality came after the special where the doctor rode a motorcycle up the skyscraper. Everything went downhill from there. The specials were arguably better, at least the cinematography, etc. was, but the actual episodes stayed at a poor quality that whole season. They ruined Matt Smith's legacy.

Agree with that 100%

 I generally tend to wash over knee-jerk expectations that every person in the squad is to be a starting 11 quality player. Carroll is definitely not the best at a ton of things, but he is homegrown and he is a good sub/rotation option for us. I don't see him ever becoming the best CM because of his size and his perceived talent potential, but...

I don't think we need to worry about him coming good in, although if he just morphs into a starting 11 player, we can have that discussion. Being a young sub is good for us. It's less wages than having an expensive quality player on the bench week in/week out and the expectations are lower. He may come back and not expect to start where someone like Dembele/Paulinho probably does. 

&gt; I'm just pointing out that there are plenty of reasons we should keep our expectations down a bit about his chances for Spurs.

Expectations should definitely be realistic, again not every player needs to be a starting 11 prospect.

This has already happened and we have a history of failing every time. When the UK built bypasses, upgraded urban junctions, trunk roads and motorways or installed SCOOT controlled traffic lights, no town took the opportunity to reallocate some of that car space to civilise their city centres or residential streets with cycle infrastructure or anything else. We have very few pedestrian zones (not counting out-of-town shopping malls which are primarily intended for motoring) or restraint on car usage in city centres.

Pylon lines cost about £2 million per mile.  Undergrounding costs around £10-25 million per mile with significant length limits. 

Underground cables can't be longer than about 10 miles or so at ""supergrid"" voltage. There is a new technology of using gas filled metal pipelines instead of regular cables which can (in theory)  go up to about 50-100 miles,but there are only about 250 miles of this technology installed worldwide with only a couple of lines longer than 10 miles installed (because it is even more expensive than cable).  We also don't have the facilities to build these gas insulated lines in the UK. 

Regular cables are much less energy efficient than pylons, but gas insulated lines are more efficient. 

Underground lines tend to be more reliable than pylons (not much info is available about gas insulated lines) but take longer to repair. Average repair time for a damaged pylon is about 24 hours. Average repair time for a damaged high voltage underground cable is about 3 weeks. 

Underground cables produce very strong magnetic fields which can be strong enough to disturb electronic equipment and are much stronger than you fields around pylons (gas lines produce negligible magnetic field).

You should follow your moisturiser with an actual sunscreen and then apply your bb cream or makeup.

Highly recommend [Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Dry-Touch-Sunblock/dp/B00008IHO3) for a low cost UVA/UVB non white cast sunscreen! After moisturising you should apply a blob about the size of a pound coin to your face, more if using some on your neck.

I also recommend getting a body sunscreen too now that the weather is getting nicer and more skin will probably be on show generally. I use any old one (Boots own usually!) that has no white cast. Arms, backs and chests suffer damage age too!
