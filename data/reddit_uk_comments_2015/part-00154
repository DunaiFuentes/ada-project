* Invest in technology and R&amp;D
* Pursue a green energy mix
* Reform the banking sector to at least the levels that were proposed ahead of the last election 
* Separate investment and retail banks
* Encourage localism and devolve power to regional councils
* Reform the electoral system to at least PR
* Stay within the ECHR 
* Aggressively pursue corporate and individual tax evasion
* Reverse the privatisation of the NHS, Education, Prisons, and Trains
* Reverse the changes to legal aid
* Force supermarkets and local authorities to find a solution to the amount of food we waste
* Build houses on brownfield and take steps to address the number of empty properties
* Support genuine apprenticeships but not crap like cleaning
* Empower teachers and reform schools along the line of the Finnish model
* Open up the Bank of England to greater democratic accountability
* Investigate and address campaign finance with a considered look at holding publicly funded elections
* Break up the media to increase plurality of ownership
* Prescriptions, Dentistry and other charged items on the NHS would be made free at the point of use again
* Treat drugs as a potential health problem (I don't believe all drug use is problematic) and license all but the worst ones through pharmacists or something similar
* Reform the House of Lords
* Provide an election recall as was proposed at the last Parliament
* Enable a referendum on anything if you can secure an agreed amount of signatures - this is more of a local thing initially
* Aggressively pursue corruption and white collar crime
* Support, encourage and enable whistle-blowers
* Invest in high speed access to the internet
* Actively use the armed forces for good when not at war by providing development assistance in developing countries
* Drastically increase the minimum wage 
* Restore labour rights 
* Restore pretty much all of the civil liberties that were eviscerated under Labour
* A wholesale investigation into how to address social mobility
* Restrict GCHQ and cease electronic data collection in all but authorised cases until a specific law is created to address the changes in technology
* Investigate and punish torture and extraordinary rendition conducted by our security services
* Move towards a social capitalism and create laws that force companies exist for the public benefit as well as profit
* Take in our share of refugees and sort out the detention centres

As for how, most of that is shifting in priorities and there will be some additional costs but there will be savings too. Costing it out would be a bit of a herculean challenge and would be subject to a tonne of variables that we could only estimate. 

How did I do?

null,false,Kubrickhammer,null,null,null,"GK: decent back-up to provide competition for Adrian, but not a priority at all. Older keeper or a younger one. Jason Steele at Boro, Jake Keane at Blackburn were good last year, i haven't tracked their progress though.

DF: Jenkinson a priority i think, then that's bascially our RB position sewn up for the next decade or so, Micah Richards as a back-up, and Kieran Trippier if we can't get either, Tyrone Mings, Fabian Schar, Steven Caulker (though I hope not), Chris Solly, Sam Byram, Van Djik. We need a CB though, no question. LBs, should we keep Cresswell, are fine, we also have Stephen Hendrie coming and probably still have JOB and Potts lying around in the back.

MF: Definitely a priority. Obiang would be fantastic, but i say we need at least two more top quality midfielders coming in. Kouyate is the only midfielder who is guaranteed a spot in the line-up next season, Noble needs some more competition. Mikel perhaps? 

FW: There's a lot of options out there it seems but sadly i think most of them are out of our range. Austin, Ings, Chicarito, Luiz Adriano, Konoplynaka, Mirallas to name a few, only one of whom would actually cost a lot of money (apart form Austin all free agents i believe). I think we'll end up with Gignac perhaps, though i reckon we're definitely one of the clubs who have a chance with Austin. He wouldn't have to leave London for a start. Either way, I think we have good options going forward and it shouldn't be our priority (for once). There's no need getting someone like Adebayor, if we're going for another striker, we have to go big (not talking height...)

What i would say is that Cresswell has proven that Championship players can step up no problem at all. We shouldn't have any reservations in shopping from the league. I think we'll get one star signing and then end the transfer window disappointed sadly.

**If you don't care for sad shit, go past this.**


All I've ever wanted was to be loved. Or well liked. Or something.

I try my hardest, really, to be a good guy and to be friendly towards everyone, but lately I just feel like everyone in my life's just slipping away. I've struggled in the past, getting bullied and so on, but in my later teens I actually felt like I had found a couple of true friends. 

I don't feel so sure anymore.

No one ever calls me, or asks me what's up. Not my friends, not my brothers, not my cousins. It's like no one really cares, except for my parents. At least they call me sometimes. I feel like shit because of this, I'm constantly tired and I don't feel like doing anything.

null,false,goa7,null,null,null,"&gt;The only certainty about the coming election in Britain is that we'll end up with the wrong government, the one we deserve, as usual, because we always vote for people who know they can break every promise and still be elected. 

&gt;One of the thornier issues in this campaign has been immigration, but we don't have an immigration problem in Britain. That's merely a symptom, and it's one of many. We have a democracy problem in that we don't actually have any say in shaping the society we live in. What we have is the appearance of democracy where every five years we vote people in on a rainbow of promises who then give us the finger and do what they like. Or more often they do what they're told, which is to push through stuff that the people didn't vote for and don't want, and then we all wonder why we didn't get what we voted for again, as we go out and vote for the same people again, and again, and again. 

&gt;They say a definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. And we really don't have any excuses, because we know that all three establishment parties have lied and lied to us in the past. And not just fibs or little white lies, but significant, serious lies. And we know they're lying now, too, and we know they're doing it because they know they'll get away with it, as they always get away with it, because we keep voting for them like a bunch of sheep. All the broken promises of yesterday - no rise in tuition fees, remember that one? - all the cast iron guarantees, the no-ifs-and-no-buts, are all gone and forgotten. They've got some shiny new promises now. See how they sparkle, you gullible muppets. 

&gt;Cameron reneged on his famous cast iron guarantee on an EU referendum as soon as he was elected. He couldn't wait to weasel out of it like a lawyer. And we elect him again, he'll do the same thing again, because that's who he is. He doesn't want a referendum. None of them do. You see, democracy in Britain (or what we like to call democracy in our more darkly humorous moments) operates on the principle that the people are always wrong, and that whatever they want is always bad. Therefore, the less genuine representation they have in government, the better. After all, if the people had their way, we'd have all sorts of crazy irresponsible policies. 

&gt;For example, we would not have gone to war in Iraq or Afghanistan if the people had had their way, because the people didn't want those wars, and made it loudly known at the time, but they were ignored and overruled because the massive egos of career politicians always know best. If the people had had their way, the bankers would not have been bailed out at our expense for their crimes against us, and now be living the high life again on massive bonuses while we continue to pay off their criminal gambling debts. If the people had their way, there would be no private profit in the health service, and funding for the police and the armed forces would not be cut and cut and cut - and cut again to make our society less secure and more dangerous while we increase the billions we already send in foreign aid to countries riddled with corruption - some with their own nuclear weapons. If the people had their way, this country would not be full of foreign terrorists and criminals we can't deport, nor would we be talking about an immigration problem, because our membership of the European Union would have been decided long ago, democratically, if just one of the many promises of a referendum had actually been kept, and who knows, we might not still be pouring fifty million pounds straight down the drain every single day for the privilege of taking orders from people we didn't elect and can't remove.

&gt;Predictably, the opinion polls tell us that the usual suspects, the red and the blue, will get most of the votes in this election, as usual, because they have rival armies of tribal supporters who would vote for a donkey if they put it up as a candidate. And, in many cases, that's exactly what they do. Parliamentary time servers and safe seat holders who can be relied on to shuffle obediently through the lobbies and vote the way they're told. Occasionally they'll kick up a fuss for appearances. They stand up, and huff and puff, and make their little speeches, then they sit down and shut up, and vote the way they're told. They call each other honourable this and right honourable that, but if they want a career (and they do, oh how they do) they have to be dishonourable and let themselves be bullied and pushed around like vassals, on our behalf. They have to renege on every cast iron guarantee they've ever given, and snuff out the voice of the people who elected them, and that's why we never seem to get what we voted for, that's why we have no control of our borders, that's why the bankers got away with their crimes, and that's why this country always seems to be at war somewhere in the world.

&gt;Anyway, how will you be voting this time around? Same as usual?

In general I think a randomly selected group of people would be less susceptible to coming under the influence of the rich and the corporate forces because there would be at least *some* people with a conscience who are aware that they will be sent back to society after their 5 years of service. Also, you'd make sure there were rules to make it harder to corrupt those people, if you were in the position to make a change in the first place in the selection process...

I wouldn't worry about your friends. Do you make time to hang out together? Not everyone will act like you do (calling and checking up on others a lot) and they certainly won't know that you would appreciate it. Being able to communicate that effectively could make you a lot happier in the future.

null,false,uisge-beatha,null,null,null,"I regret to say that your friend comes across as a well meaning fool.  he makes certain legitimate criticisms, but for the most part he is parroting cynicism without realism, and a smugness at how disaffected he is with power without providing any solutions.  I can't speak for what happened after the video stopped, but he gave a promise to hold other parties to account, then eliminated nearly very means he might do this.  He won't go door-to-door, he wont win, he won't publish literature.  His presence at hustings is a possible way of doing this, but his opening remarks gave nothing to that promise.            
    
He tells a room full of white hair that ""when you're young politicians seem to be wiser ... they seem to know what they're doing."" (c2.08).  This might have been the case when he and many others were young, but it is not the case for me (at 21), or anyone I know.  I wager I spend more time with young people as they exist today, and we are as aware that politicians are not philosopher-kings, and are detached elites as he is.  For many, this is alienating and they don't vote.  For others, they aspire to do better.    
What is he trying to demonstrate there?  The fact that he is aged shouldn't be surprising, and I have no clue what interesting new thought he was trying to prove by pointing it out.  (Was it a cynical attempt to disillusion the electorate with the current powerful, and thereby make himself credible by contrast?  Make himself 'one of us', as opposed to the alien 'them' (in this case, politicians).  Perhaps; and certainly a reliable strategy.)       
    
He states that ""politics and people have never been so disconnected."" (2.36)  This is a patently moronic thing to say.  When the world was ruled by kings the political movements of families were far more disconnected from the ruled than now.  When government changed hands between the Tories and the Whigs the majority of the people did not have influence over governmental power.  Today, almost the whole adult citizenry has a vote, and can stand; so to complain about the disconnect is admirable if one is recognising what has been won, but to ignore that we have the apparatus and declare that the disconnect is worse than ever demonstrates total and catastrophic ignorance of how we got it.  For someone using the apparatus of democracy to gain a platform I would have hoped he'd have a little more regard for how it was won.  Criticise the disconnect at all times, yes, but in a way that is constructive, rather than declaring ""it's fucked"" to riotous applause from a moronic audience.       
       
He criticises the lack of 'conviction politicians' (nice phrase).  Seemingly considering the current range of candidates to be cynical opportunists.  It's probably the case for some, but it takes an unrealistically craven view to think someone will accept the vitriol, the lack of privacy, and the workload that accelerated ageing to a visible degree without a desire to change things for (whatever they perceive to be) the better.  Conviction is important, but compromise is necessary.  The obstinance of the US house of representatives (and a lot of statehouses) should provide a sufficiently dystopic view of conviction without pragmatism to forgive some of the LibDems transgressions.      
       
He does make a number of very legitimate criticisms.  He notes the absence of a powerful left-wing option.  If he seeks someone on the left to vote for, the options might be to join the greens and go door-to-door on their behalf.  Alternatively, he could join Labour, and find that it is full of visionaries; they do not have the ability to direct the party machine, but as it is a party teaming with Marxists and Blairites, they compromise.  He can contribute (as many of my friends do, from hard left and right-of-center commitments) to the overall direction of the party.    
If this is not sufficient, I think he is correct to say he must stand himself - I agree that when there is no one for you to vote for, you are obliged to stand.  I do not know how the rest of the hustings went, but from what you shared he seems undeserving of votes.  His criticisms were sometimes on the mark, but they were a bit tinfoil-hat-ish and failed to be constructive.  Perhaps he gave better arguments in answer to questions?  I cannot say.    
    
I would be curious - what specific policies does he offer?    
did he go on to hold other parties to account for failings?  can you provide any details?       
how does he plan to make a significant impact only present at hustings?      
were there to be some fluke, and he won 56% of the vote - how would he conduct himself as an MP?  would he take the seat?    
    
wish him luck from us, and I hope he is doing better work than represented there.

If not then can you explain why the law should be applied differently to Hopkins.

Your words are comforting, for sure.

I feel like I'm always mentioning that I've got all the time in the world to hang out, whenever I talk to someone. 
I'm studying from home right now, so as long as I complete my assignments in time, I have all the free time I want.

But I've come to a point where it just boiled over, you know? 

The last couple of days I've not been in touch with anyone, as an experiment of sorts, to see how many days, weeks or even months it takes until someone asks me what's wrong.

I haven't talked to anyone about it, because it feels like some people would take it the wrong way, and I'm afraid it would push them away even more.

I have one friend I could talk to about it, but he's moved to Norway, and he's technologically impaired, so we don't talk much.

I think your approach is wrong here. Sure, you're mentioning that you're free, but it's not necessarily obvious that you want to do something with others, and more importantly, that you want to do something *with the people you're talking to*. 

It's easy to think that you're dropping a big enough hint for people to read and pick up on, but honestly, if there is something that you want in life, then your best course of action is be direct. Say what you want and don't be afraid of being honest to yourself for that. 

There's a lot of stipulations around that of course, it's not easy to do if you're feeling low or low on self-confidence. But I think that's something to work your way up to. Learning how to communicate effectively and maturely will lead to a lot of happiness in your future.

The problem with silent suffering is that no one has any idea what's going on. I go a few days or even weeks without checking in on some of my friends. It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm busy. If I knew they needed me to check in with them, I would absolutely do it though. So to be honest, I think you're torturing yourself for no reason. I don't see how you could get the results that you're after.

You don't know what's going on in other people's lives, you don't know their struggles. We (I) do and we can help you; they don't, so I think it's a bit unfair to expect them to help solve a problem they aren't likely to be aware of.

I understand your fear that it would push people away; yeah, it's something delicate that's hard to express. Try to bring it up once jokingly? 'You guys never call me, it hurts' in a laughing matter. Just a suggestion.

null,false,grodecki,,Accountant,null,"This is a seriously difficult question to answer definitively.

You won't get a better rate than 5.5, fixed. You might through a stocks and shares ISA but then there is the risk you will lose money, also.

However, the repayment terms make it a very different proposition. With a normal loan with a rate of 5.5% you'd have to pay back that loan, plus the 5.5% by the end of the year. As you do not have to do this with a student loan, it means the interest rate is not actually as of much relevance as what you actually want the money for.

If you are aiming to buy a house very quickly after university, and the extra £X thousand here would aid in getting a deposit together, it would make much more sense to take this loan, as the generous repayment terms mean that it will work out better for you to utilise this as opposed to spending x years saving for it. 

Equally if your career prospects peg you as someone who is never going to come close to paying off their total loan, there is zero disadvantage to taking it.

If however, you are likely to pay off the whole loan, **and** there is no advantage a large capital injection would have on your life in the short-med term (I'd say up to 5-6 years, I've not done the maths), don't take it. 

Personally, for example, if I were in your position, I would take it, as even though I am on the career trajectory to pay back my loan within the timescale (and would be on the higher fees, also), as it would add a large chunk to savings for a house deposit.

However, if I had no intention of buying a house, I would not take it as I would be paying more for it in the long term as I will pay it off.

If I had no intention of buying a house in the short term but also had no plans to pay off the loan within it's lifespan, I would take the loan and save it as the loan repayments are actually totally irrelevant to me. 

A large proportion of people really, really struggle with the concept of student loans and the fact that they are not, in any way, a real debt. They are something you pay back, but in a very very different way, which doesn't really impact you in any noticable way. (other than the pay drop if you're employed straight out of uni in April when repayments start... which ishappening to me this month, joys!). Adding the extra factor that you don't actually need the money makes it even more confusing and means the time/oppertunity value of money comes into account which is something a lot of people won't even remotely think about as everyone is raised with a 'all debt is bad debt' thought process.

&gt; You wouldn't have been likely to hear of a comedian/writer in the USSR doing jokes about how Stalin was a genocidal, paranoid monster; because that would seriously challenge the assumed values of that society and would cause outrage and hatred.

Anyway, here's my favourite genuine, vintage Soviet joke.

Joseph Stalin is making a speech to the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He is in full rhetorical flow when suddenly the sound of a sneeze echoes throughout the chamber. Stalin halts mid-sentence and a chilling silence descends. Stalin enquires in a soft, almost innocent voice, ""Comrades, who sneezed just now?"" Silence. Stalin clicks his fingers. The leather-jacketed NKVD agents take the first row of delegates, march them out of the chamber and machine gun them against the wall. Stalin asks again, more firmly this time, ""Comrades, who sneezed?"" Silence. The second row is marched out and machine gunned. Stalin asks a third time, this time, visibly irritated, ""Comrades! Who sneezed?"" In the third row, a trembling hand is raised. An old frail delegate, must be close to a hundred speaks up, ""I did, Comrade Stalin"". ""Well then God bless you, Comrade!""",null,1,null,1429900603,null,0,false,0,cqngaq6,null,t3_33ovy9,null,t1_cqngaq6,null,t1_cqn7ztm,null,null,null,1432582505,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Agreed with Enrique, but I'm just not sure we'd get anything for him and he's another with only one more year so I could see us just hanging onto him for depth.

Toure is a weird one, think we've offered him an extension, but not real sure what the deal is.  Would be happy to have him for another year.

Totally agreed with you on the last part.  Mourinho has often said he doesn't want more than 24 players and I think he's spot on there.  And I very much agree about our kids getting more time as injury cover- they've almost never let us down in the past and occasionally one of them (e.g. Raheem) when given a chance may surprise us all.

Just to clarify, imo he's apolitical ideologically (and his humour is based off of personal experience) and (probably) a democrat in a party political sense, but I imagine that he would be considered right wing on some issues, especially by the metropolitan liberal left today. I'm not sure what that says about either but  I remember doing a reading about the huge fuss that ""black people vs niggas"" bit caused with several establishment black magazines writing long pieces about how he was a reactionary etc

I  think what is ""left"" and ""right"" (especially on social issues) often breaks down into a sort of series of opinions and positions that people seem drawn to depending on their interests,  traditions and alliances etc, with people sometimes ending up on different sides at different times in their life. Depending on your perspective even foundational parts of ""the left"" like large sections of the union movement would be considered conservative (on social issues etc) by a lot of the metropolitan left liberal culture of today. I think that something like this is true of Chris Rock and a lot of the black comedy circuit tradition that he's part of, even though I agree that they are mostly apolitical and Democrat in a party political sense. Something similar is true of the classic 'conscious' east coast rappers that nation of Islam or other (somewhat conservative in some ways) black nationalist organisations were very influential over.

&gt;People in ancient societies thought their societies were obviously great. The imperial Chinese thought nothing could beat imperial China, the medieval Spaniards thought medieval Spain was a singularly impressive example of perfection, and Communist Soviets were pretty big on Soviet Communism. Meanwhile, we think 21st-century Western civilization, with its democracy, secularism, and ethnic tolerance is pretty neat. Since the first three examples now seem laughably wrong, we should be suspicious of the hypothesis that we finally live in the one era whose claim to have gotten political philosophy right is totally justified.
&gt;But it seems like we have an advantage they don’t. Speak out against the Chinese Empire and you lose your head. Speak out against the King of Spain and you face the Inquisition. Speak out against Comrade Stalin and you get sent to Siberia. The great thing about western liberal democracy is that it has a free marketplace of ideas. Everybody criticizes some aspect of our society. Noam Chomsky made a career of criticizing our society and became rich and famous and got a cushy professorship. So our advantage is that we admit our society’s imperfections, reward those who point them out, and so keep inching closer and closer to this ideal of perfect government.
Okay, back up. Suppose you went back to Stalinist Russia and you said “You know, people just don’t respect Comrade Stalin enough. There isn’t enough Stalinism in this country! I say we need two Stalins! No, fifty Stalins!”
Congratulations. You have found a way to criticize the government in Stalinist Russia and totally get away with it. Who knows, you might even get that cushy professorship.
&gt;If you “criticize” society by telling it to keep doing exactly what it’s doing only much much more so, society recognizes you as an ally and rewards you for being a “bold iconoclast” or “having brave and revolutionary new ideas” or whatever. It’s only when you tell them something they actually don’t want to hear that you get in trouble.

This is the kind of ""subversion"" that you are talking about. The kind of ""subversion"" that Charlie Brooker and Stewart Lee and Frankie Boyle engage in. i.e. telling society that it isn't liberal enough, and isn't living up to its own liberal ideas enough. Telling us we need 50 Stalins. It's not subversive at all. It's systemic reinforcement disguised as a critique. Note that these people get careers and awards thrown at them for their ""brave"" views. Genuinely subversive material would probably be illegal.",null,0,null,1429901570,null,0,false,0,cqngx1t,null,t3_33ovy9,null,t1_cqngx1t,null,t1_cqngfn4,null,null,null,1432582797,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

&gt;When Rush Limbaugh made a joke about some slut, hordes of leftists came out of the woodwork to use shaming tactics (i.e., “You’re an evil misogynist!”) to silence him. If you want to engage in any sort of public dialogue, therefore, you must do it from a position of dominance and assertion. Jokes require the audience to assent to the topic. If the audience won’t let you make a joke, you can’t make a joke. 

So, ""some slut"" refers to Sandra Fluke, who was a student who gave evidence at a Congressional hearing about contraception and medical insurance. As everyone knows, the US doesn't have a proper healthcare system and insurance schemes can pretty much pick and chose that they want to cover. So, Sandra Fluke was explaining what it was like for students who want to take care of their reproductive health, ""contraceptives can cost a woman over $3000 during law school"".

To which Limbaugh responded ""essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.""

This isn't a joke, it's an attack. Limbaugh doesn't care about the humour value of equating insurance coverage of basic medial services to prostitution, he wants to attack and humiliate an ordinary woman (not a public person) who had the gall to speak out about sexual health. It's vile, it's mean, it's nasty and there's no joke to be had. But that's not all, at the end of the day, you think this is an example of the *persecution* of right-wing Limbaugh! This is why I think you're a nut job, because your world-view is so warped that you have everything backwards, black becomes white, war becomes peace, perpetrator becomes victim.

From what I can see, there aren't any values at work here at all, just bitter, nasty cuntishness.

Edit: Wiki actually has this episode well covered. Here's a nice quote from a Bush speechwriter about Limbaugh's attempt at ""public dialogue"":

&gt; David Frum, former special assistant to President George W. Bush (emphasis in the original): ""Limbaugh's verbal abuse of Sandra Fluke set a new kind of low. I can't recall *anything* as brutal, ugly and deliberate ever being said by such a prominent person and so emphatically repeated. This was not a case of a bad 'word choice'. It was a brutally sexualized accusation, against a specific person, prolonged over three days.""[",null,0,null,1429902545,null,0,1429902959,0,cqnhj5z,null,t3_33ovy9,null,t1_cqnhj5z,null,t1_cqngis1,null,null,null,1432583087,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,null,"A letter of reference from ""your mate"" wouldn't carry the same weight as a letter from your employer. You're correct that it may not help with mitigation. The circumstances of this case are very different to the scenario you present.

Video evidence isn't as reliable as you may think. Indeed magistrates and judges are reminded to treat video evidence in a similar way to eye witness testimony which is also less reliable than you think. We do not, as you claim, see the entirety of the attack. We don't see what happened in the lead up to the assault by the two soldiers. All of the evidence from prosecution and defence will have been heard in court along with cross examination of witnesses, full description and pictures of injuries, victim impact statements, character references and previous convictions. The judge won't have relied on a few seconds of video to make a decision. All of this additional evidence is relevant to the attack, we don't have trial by youtube in the UK.

Please point out my comment where I say that I *""see no problem in the army still employing them""*.

Once again you make a baseless assumption that the judge is relying solely on a reference to make a sentencing decision. He had all of the facts before him, you have a video and a newspaper report. Newspapers are quite poor at reporting court cases. They need to sell newspapers but court cases are generally long and boring. Reports often miss out the detail in favour of the more lurid highlights.

Your side note highlights your lack of understanding of the trial procedure. If a defendant pleads not guilty yet is found guilty after trial then you can't then prosecture them for lying in court. If this were the case then almost all defendants pleading not guilty but subsequently found guilty would then have another charge laid on them.

Perfect example is when he was easily one of the top performers in a match (and completely changed the dynamic of the game) yet Rodgers still spoke negatively about him in the post game. Seems pretty clear this is more of a Rodgers vs. Committee politics issue. I don't think Balotelli has done anything that merits the derision.

null,false,whigwham,null,null,null,"From the Green party [policy document](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html):

&gt;EC751 Inheritance Tax will be reformed so that it is calculated on a ""recipient basis"" (i.e. with reference to the circumstances of the person receiving the inheritance rather than the donor). It will also be extended to include gifts made during a donor's lifetime, rather than just those given as inheritances on death, therefore becoming an accessions tax.

&gt; EC752 There will be an annual exemption/threshold for amounts received as gifts or inheritances. As with Income Tax, receipts of this kind will be averaged over a five year period. Any taxable amounts which remain above the tax-free threshold will then be assessed for Inheritance Tax.

&gt; EC753 Inheritance Tax rates will be progressively banded, with rates of tax increasing according to a recipient's total income/wealth. Recipients who only pay Income Tax at lower rates will not be subject to Inheritance Tax.

&gt; EC754 The tax-free threshold will be sufficient to ensure that most ordinary gifts between members of families with moderate incomes will not be taxed, and, as gifts will be averaged over a five year period, it will also allow for larger ""one-off"" gifts (such as those received on marriage, or given by parents to their offspring to help them buy a house).

The idea is basically to close the loophole that allows people to use ""gifts"" as a way of getting around paying inheritance tax. The normal presents people give each other wouldn't be taxed at all, even big one off gifts would be tax free.

&gt;Conservatives are constrained by the reigning leftoid Hivemind orthodoxies. Conservatives with audiences larger than three people have a limited ability to skewer liberal shibboleths without getting into serious career-ending trouble. Limbaugh’s backpedaling slut smear apology is Exhibit S. Has a leftoid on any of these fake news shows ever had to grovel before the inquisition for maliciously slandering a right-wing representative? No. They have license to smear their right-wing targets, something that non-leftoids cannot do to with the same gusto to sanctified liberal targets like Sandra Fluke.

In your attempts to show just how outrageous and morally unforgivable Rush's comments were, you're betraying and proving my entire point, which is that these witch trials are only allowed to happen because left-liberalism is completely powerfully dominant in society in a way which the right is not. They can get away with dismissing the right with as many emotive trigger words as you like, your own comment is full of them, nasty vile bile toxic etc. etc. essentialising non-liberal opinions to a form of hatred bordering on a disease.

The problem is that if parliament had purely English MPs voting on English only matters and they decided to slash public spending, under the current system the other three bits of the country would have their budget slashed without any say in the matter.

Now, they could get around this by getting rid of the Barnett formula, creating an English parliament and dissolving the House of Commons, but neither of the main parties are likely to be willing to give up their centralised power.

As far as the West Lothian question is concerned, it's a bit more complicated. I don't think Scottish MPs should vote on English or English &amp; Welsh only matters like policing or education, since English MPs rightly aren't able to vote on those issues in Scotland. The SNP don't vote on English issues as a matter of principle, but Scottish Labour, Tory and Lib Dem MPs routinely do. However, because of the way the Barnett formula works, health and education spending in England has a direct impact on how much money Scotland gets in its block grant from Westminster, so it can be argued that it is directly in the interests of Scottish MPs and their constituents to vote on funding for these services in England.

First is EVEL. English votes for English laws. It sounds simple. It sounds like common sense. It sound completely practical and fair. Who wouldn't be in favour of that?!

Well, here's why.

The way the rest of the UK is funded, it's based on the votes on the British (English) budget.

So, if English MP's vote on reducing or increasing a part of the budget, it therefore changes the budget of Wales, NI and Scotland. If you exclude the other regions' MPs, it becomes taxation without representation.

The solution to this would be a Federal UK. The people in the way of this would be the Tories. An English parliament would surely use a proportional system like the other regional Parliaments. This would greatly reduce their power in comparison to a UK Parliament which locked out 'non-tory MP's' from the other parts of the country.

In effect, EVEL screws Labour. Federal UK screws Tories.

&gt;She has taken him to court several times but he warps the truth and hides money very well. 

You're going to have to explain further. Was the judgement in your favour? If not, why?

&gt;He is very good with his money and is very rarely in the UK i know he has company's registered under someone else name in Argentina (i think) as well as at least 7 other company's and trust funds some of which do almost nothing but hold and move about hundreds of thousands of pounds. Some of these are a trust fund where one of his company's is recorded as a member of the board and the company is not in his name. 

If he's smart, he's going to have money under a limited company meaning the money actually belongs to company, not father. Does he own any of companies in the UK? If so, consider this: If he's bankrupt, he's banned from being a director of company.

As for views, most cycle routes in nottingham are at ground level, or are through forested areas so you don't really get scenic views.

The best place I would recommend is Colwick Woods, in Bakersfield (Not Colwick Park)

Colwick woods is on higher ground so you can see some of the more amazing views that you don't really get from inner Nottingham.

Forgive my tending to the furthest outlier (it helps with finding out the limits) but writing something like ""These people should be killed before they get to our coast"" (or mentioning gunships perhaps?) would likely shock people because it's rather extreme. Incitement to murder and all that, I imagine. Then again is it shock or concern that that kind of thing will result in others being put at risk?

I'll reword my (rhetorical) question: where should we draw the line? As I said before many people agree with slander, and I would say incitement to murder, being on the wrong side of legal. If I threaten someone: that is not considered free speech. I can say it but I'm going to be in trouble. Similarly there's a law against calling for the death of a particular groups (e.g. ethnic minority). The latter is because, I believe, in the past those groups have been persecuted or subject to violence.

How do you factor those into free speech exactly and, if you do agree with those things being subject to restrictions, what would Hopkins have to write to go beyond the legal bounds? In your opinion, that is.",null,0,null,1429908701,null,0,false,0,cqnlb2p,null,t3_33p8gp,null,t1_cqnlb2p,null,t1_cqnkvnr,null,null,null,1432584865,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Hopkins wasn't telling people to go out and commit violent acts.  Rather she was arguing (rather badly in my opinion) for a policy change.  And yes, her remarks were reprehensible, but you can't  outlaw them without seriously damaging our ability to discuss political issues.  What would be next?

So basically a 4-3-2-1. 

Coutinho and Sterling would be more central unless space opened up on the wing for them to exploit. The fullbacks would push higher up to act as wide support with Henderson and the other CM (Lallana/Allen) covering the fullback too.

Can will sit in front of the central defense and do what he does from the back - calm assured passing, some defense and the odd rampage up the pitch.

I'm assuming we'll get a new right back, hence the question mark.

i also think it's hard for either of us to speak of the balotelli situation because we are not there on the training pitch or see how he interacts with anyone. and balotelli isn't getting a run of games because he isn't putting in a run in training. if not that, it's politics and it still plays into my argument that he's had a poor season. just because balo plays well for 30 minutes in a game doesn't mean he deserves a start. if he doesn't do it in training, which it must be from the way it seems, then he won't start. simple as. BR has proven time and again you earn your spots through consistency in matches and training. anyways...i feel bad for the guy, he's an amazing talent who has not had a good time in liverpool. i think he should stay becasue i think he could be a 10-15 goal/season striker for us. and that's if he's playing second fiddle to sturridge. he's only 24 and has loads of time to figure shit out...and quite honestly, i have a niggling suspicion that BR has kept him out of the limelight on purpose in order to bed him into the team and the city. seems reasonable.

I never look to see what time I *need* to catch a train these days, only which lines I should be going on. I went to see my dad up  near Rutland a few weeks back and it was very confusing after having not really been there for the last few years. They still only have one train an hour there, and the buses are one an hour if you're lucky and the drivers didn't stop at the pub for a pint and a piss and a chat to the barstaff.

Even on a Sunday, it's fairly remarkable how easy it is to get around. Some days it's a bit more complicated (catching two buses instead of a train; or a bus then a train, instead of two trains) but even then, I can still get from point A to point B without ever having to walk more than a few hundred metres between 6am and midnight (and even a little either side of that).

It's so reliable that I didn't even bother to check which tubelines were running when I caught the train to get back to London at 11pm on a Sunday evening. I got to the underground, read the signs, chose a route that worked, caught the trains and was home within 5 minutes of my usual travel time from Kings Cross.

People can complain all they want about public transport, but within London it is reliable and it is (mostly) relatively clean.

You just have to learn which lines to avoid when. Never go near the Jubilee, Victoria or Paddington near rush hour, for example. London Bridge is pretty bad, but given that the trains I want to catch at London Bridge originate at Cannon Street for the most part then I can just take that route and avoid the entire issue of London Bridge.

null,false,Cold_Dawn95,null,null,null,"Tbf on first glance it seems logical to create regional assemblies in England comparable with those in Wales, NI &amp; Scotland, using similar boundaries to those regions in England which are used for the European Elections. For some matters these regional assemblies would make sense such as health &amp; education, as well as replacing some parts local government which at the moment is bloated and ineffective. The issue is that some matters such as justice and taxation would still make a lot more sense to legislate on a England wide basis so the House of Commons would still be needed too (In addition to presiding over the matters which affect the whole of the UK). This means another layer of government would be added to the 4 which already exist, which is not a popular idea with many voters even if it would help give them better representation. And of course due to the way the Barnett formula arbitrarily divides up the funding to each part of the UK, meaning that the funding levels of the English NHS and schools etc. affect those in the other 3 parts of the country.

In short the whole devolution issue is screwed up and there are no easy answers but the current situation is untenable with MPs voting on matters which don't concern them &amp; funding affecting other regions. A federal UK is my solution of choice but public apathy for more politicians, in addition to political self interest of the 2 big parties means it will take a brave government indeed to fix the mess.",null,0,null,1429910531,null,0,false,0,cqnmc03,null,t3_33quzu,null,t1_cqnmc03,null,t1_cqniw8h,null,null,null,1432585419,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

So why Bayern supervisory board members are the same like main sponsors of Bayern? That is illegal by UEFA, they punished Etihad and Man City for that. But lets look. 1. Main sponsor of Bayern is Audi, Audi CEO prof. Rupert Stadler is also member (vice chairman) of Bayern Supervisory board, as his boss, German state control VW CEO, Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn who is also member of the Bayern supervisory board. 2. Main sponsor of Bayern is Adidas A/G, member (vice chairman too) of the Bayern supervisory board is Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer, so once again, Bayern have the same sponsor and member of supervisory board. So member of Supervisory board Herberth Hainer in the name of the Adidas decide with how much money he will sponsor Bayern? It is illegal by UEFA! 3. Main sponsor is Allianz Deutschland AG.

&gt; Athletic began playing in an improvised white kit, but in the 1902–03 season, the club's first official strip became half-blue, half-white shirts similar to those worn by Blackburn Rovers, which were donated by Juan Moser. Later, a young student from Bilbao named Juan Elorduy, who was spending Christmas 1909 in London, was charged by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but was unable to find enough. Waiting for the ship back to Bilbao and empty handed, Elorduy realised that the colours of the local team Southampton matched the colours of the City of Bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take with him. Upon arriving in Bilbao, the club's directors decided almost immediately to change the team's strip to the new colours, and since 1910, Athletic Club have played in red and white stripes. Of the 50 shirts bought by Elorduy, half were then sent to Atlético Madrid, which had originally begun as a youth branch of Athletic.

Also while you are fiddling it might be good to:

* Check torque settings on all the bolts.

* Pull off the callipers and give them a good clean. Checking pads and discs condition while off.

* Lubricate all hinges, pivots and clutch cable with appropriate grease/spray.

* Check air pressure on tyres, after checking for cracking and rot.

* Check chain and sprockets for damage and wear.

These are all very basic to do and could save you from a breakdown, or hospital.

I'm assuming at the end you mean calendar year and not tax year, 

I believe you would be taxed on your earning as an annual salary of £17000 is over your personal allowance of £10600.

However if this is your only income and depending how it falls into the 2015/16 &amp; 2016/17 tax years some of your tax will be refunded.

This is because the usual rules for paye is where they assume your monthly pay will be continuous for 12 months during the tax year.

If Barca were to seel Montoya, they would he reduced to one Rb. Douglas. Who is awful. Name one team that has one Rb in their entire squad. Barca can't sign anyone. 

And I'm not saying you're wrong to say Liverpool should go for a Rb just that Montoya isn't likely. Despite the fact you say he will be a possible signing without giving any suggestion as to why

I went to a private school where, technically, caning was still legal up until 1998.  That notwithstanding, the school had phased out corporal punishment even before 1985 when it was banned in state schools.  One of the older relic teachers said that she always hated doing it anyway.

&gt; And it was only the 80s I experienced my school days

Yup, people do seem to think that harsh classroom discipline and barely habitable schools died out in the 1960s... wrong.

I started school in 1992 and to be honest, even that recently, classroom discipline was actually quite harsh especially given we're talking about 5-6 year old kids.  There was a lot of ""authoritarian"" behaviour exhibited towards us, a lot of strong words, we were very much kept in our place, but despite all of this we learned a lot and were mostly happy.  A lot of the teachers were a fair bit older (and some have definitely since died) and were in their teaching prime during the 1970s and 80s where things were much stricter anyway.  Even later in the 90s I had some teachers that had been at the school for 20+ years and it showed, much stricter almost 1970s attitudes.

Actually, in my school the sixth formers acted as 'buddies' to younger classes and I remember some in 1992/1993 with my class.

Sunderland - Southampton and Everton, think they'll lose both.

Leicester - Chelsea and Newcastle, with a game in hand I see them beating Newcastle but not Chelsea.

Hull - Liverpool and Arsenal, home fixtures but I think they should lose both, they've also got a few in shorter time frame.

Burnley - Hull and West Ham, I see them winning both.

&gt; Would a more powerful Lib Dem party in a position to form a coalition with either of the main parties support, or go against, progressive political goals?

They have said that they will provide heart for the Tories and brains for Labour, so I imagine they would to some extent stop the Tories from being too conservative and Labour from being too progressive (at least economically).

My overall advise would be not to vote tactically, I understand the temptation but we need to change how we vote to get the change we want. The higher the Green vote in your constituency this time the less likely people are to think its a wasted vote next time.

2) He's been an unused sub 8 times.  So, collectively, he hasn't been used 25 times out of 32 by Barca.  Hardly indicative of someone they think can replace Alves long term given it's 100% certain Alves will not be there next season.  If they rated him highly, I suspect they would actually be using him, certainly more often than they have.

3) There have been rumors for awhile now that Montoya wants out.

4) As for what they could do- they could convert Adriano into a RB and pull Grimaldo in to be the backup for Alba or they could use Douglas or they could promote Patric (unlikely admittedly).

Will they sell him, particularly before January? I have no idea and it might even be described as unlikely, but I don't think it's completely out of the question either.  You make it sound like I'm saying we should go for Reus or something equally ridiculous.

And what's wrong with Coleman?  He's a good RB, albeit a Blue and therefore unlikely.

I can't remember who suggested Finacea or how I found that out, but I got a tube and holy ****, I started seeing result within 4 weeks. 3 months in, almost all of them are already faded away, if not cleared out. Not just the PIH, my whole face skin lightened, but strangely enough, not my freckles.

However, incorporating Finacea into a routine was pretty tricky as it's rather drying and irritating on me (and also many others according to their testimonies). I switched over to Skinoren and my skin loves it. I had to stop once because my face lightened so much, it's too stark a difference to my neck and chest.

They have their own manifesto - while the other three quarters of the UK are bunched into one manifesto. That in itself is prioritising. He is also scaremongering left right and centre about the SNP supporting labour (therefore having a Scottish party as a minor coalition partner), they are frightened that the rise in Scottish Nationalism will give way to an empowered Scotland - so the tactic they are using to defeat this new trend is to try their hand at English Nationalism with the promise of new England Only votes in parliament - like English controlled tax powers.

You don't beat Scottish Nationlism with English Nationalism.

 The very point of Scotland gaining devolved tax powers and indeed NI gaining tax powers is that we have control over them, and are therefore better able to bring foreign investment to the land - England having that same power would enable them to lower their taxes to the same levels (indeed, they would be able to go lower than us), effectively taking away the whole point of devolved tax powers and maintaining a London-centric UK economy. **Thus, favouring England**.

null,false,lmc32,null,null,null,"Just to throw in another way of thinking about it:

Arsenal at that time had not won a trophy for what 5 or 6 years, and fabergaes had seen other big names sold and an obvious lack of ambition at the club. He obviously loved the club, and I think would have stayed there if they were winning trophys, but he didn't want to waste the prime of his career in a losing arsenal side, especially when he could see his other love, Barcelona winning everything under the sun. 

If Chelsea stopped winning regular trophys you think hazard, Costa etc stick around? No, they dont have a long history with the club like JT and lamps did. I ask now, what would my reaction to that be? I would be irrated no doubt, but my blame would go to the club for not showing the ambition to surround these players with a good enough supporting cast! I honestly believe that 3-4years down the line I'd me smiling at hazard winning the balon d'or at Madrid and remember all the joy he brought to Chelsea fc! Thankfully, I can't see that happening with Chelsea, because we are winning regularly and the club obviously cares about continued success and I can rejoice even more when he wins the balon d'or with us.

A comparable example is Suarez, and I hate using Liverpool fans as an example. But Suarez gave his all at Liverpool, for less time than fabregaes. What reaction do you think Suarez would get if he played against Liverpool in the next few years. I am pretty confident he'd get an excellent reception. Liverpool fans, at least the ones I've spoken to, respected his decision and although may be hard to swallow, but realised at the time he was to big for the club. They cashed in on him, just as arsenal did on fabregaes. 

I would also argue that when a player of that quality wants to come back and play for you, you make room. As we have shown, fabregaes can play as the 10 or a deeper. Imagine having two world class passes picking balls through to the striker. Again arsenals fault as a club, not fabregaes'. Despite him wanting to go back to arsenal.

 Comparing it to your analogy:

I would say its like a man (fabregaes) loves 2 women, barca and arsenal. Hes seeing the first woman and its going well. But all of a sudden she stops making an effort, be it emotionally, physically whatever. Maybe she gets really fat, depending on how superficial you are, haha. Then an option with his other love arises, she's looking good and really pays more attention to the mans needs. He could stay an be unhappy with the first girl, who knows what she's doing wrong but unwilling to change her ways. Or he can see the other girl and be happy.

4 years later things didn't work out with the second girl, so he looks up the first girl, and she's doing better (don't want to oversell arsenal here, lol), so you call her up, but she is too stubborn to see what went wrong last time. The man after all still loves the first girl, but she drove him away.

Being a long term replacement for Alves is irrelevant. As they will probably sign a new RB when they can. But for the time being they will have to do with Montoya.

UKIP have almost zero seats and are projected at getting a handful at most, if I remember correctly.

&gt; Because we need to hamstring them in order for us to get an unfair advantage?

They have an unfair advantage as the entire majority of the UK economy is in the capital of England - by letting us control our taxes it decentralises London as the economic centre, and creates jobs in other underdeveloped (in comparison to London anyway) areas of the UK. It's restoring the balance - it won't be creating an unfair advantage unless we keep it lower than England forever after we have our own decent economy.

&gt; Having a separate, noncontradictory manifesto for one region is not prioritising - why would Scottish voters be interested in issues not concerning them?

English Taxes affects Scotland, sorry to tell you - English taxes lower than Scotland = Business setting up shop in London. Scottish taxes lower than England = business setting up shop in Edinburgh.

When you compare England and Scotland, its clear Scotland is criminally underdeveloped. Scotland attracting investment restores balance. Therefore of course Scotland are interested in keeping 'England only' voting out.

The referendum is a totally different kettle of fish sorry. No, I am not saying that.

The core of players we have need to start contending for things or else they'll leave. I'm concerned that Sterling might be the first of many if the current trend of league and cup finishes continues. There is a massively talented, young core of players in the squad but they get no help from the blundering in the transfer market that leads to Sakho trying to shore up a back line with Lovren or Coutinho trying to feed a through ball to a static Balotelli. 

I said it the other day and I'll say it again: the worst position a manager can be in is to be underachieving when there is an available replacement who could get more out of the squad than he is. I think that's where Rodgers is now, in that Klopp is available, by all accounts would be interested and very likely would have got more out of the squad and attracted better players to the club.

For fuck's sake, Brendan doesn't need to win to prove he is a good manager. Winning a trophy is a combination of luck and preparation for opportunity. This year, everyone would be right to say, we should have gotten out of our CL group and gotten to the FA Cup final. But there are better teams that haven't. 

Would anyone here be satisfied with winning the FA Cup if we finished 7th? The League Cup if we finished 5th? 

The only thing Brendan should be graded on in a purely ""what did we do"" sense is our finish in the league. We are still in with a shout for 4th and there are going to be a lot of people looking like idiots if we do that very possible thing. 

Arsene Wenger went years without a trophy. Nearly a decade (if not a decade). If you go back to his ""track record"", well then let's remember that he was given time with his fucking team. He was given fucking time. He came from shittier leagues before that. So his track record before Arsenal is fucking irrelevant.

That goes for Klopp to an extent as well. The Bundesliga may be competitive, but it was also way more wide open when he won his two league titles. It's also way easier to cement yourself as a CL contender because there is no clear number two side after Bayern. Which is completely different than the space and time Rodgers inherited Liverpool. There's four sides that can outspend us. There's four sides that have won things while we haven't won in the league for two decades. There's four sides that have been able to consolidate their owning the CL slots while we fell off a cliff with H&amp;G. 

There is no miracle cure for Liverpool. There just fucking isn't. Whoever comes in will not elevate us purely based off his arrival. They will have to move forward within the parameters that FSG gives them and that the league has forced on us. 

As such, there is no reason to give up on a manager who has had us playing some of the best football in Europe. Who has found a way to get a side on undefeated runs while not having a legitimate striker in the first 11. 

Brendan Rodgers is a great fucking manager. He's run into problems like all managers do. But you boo-boys haven't got a fucking clue what's going to be required to get us consistently finishing in 4th or higher. And all this rot about winning trophies is completely meaningless. Arsenal didn't win one for a decade. But they finished 4th. That's all that we need to be pushing for. And frankly fucking speaking, when you look at the top 6 sides, I would expect every year for the next decade (barring major outside investment) that it's going to be musical chairs for 3-6. It hurts us the most because we can't afford wages, nor do we offer a nice location compared to London (Tottenham), but we'll just have to make fucking do.",null,0,null,1429925840,null,0,false,0,cqnu3ua,null,t3_33rtmo,null,t1_cqnu3ua,null,t3_33rtmo,null,null,null,1432589152,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

According to my friend who works at a training camp putting the boot on the other foot fixes helps adjust their attitude about 8% of the time, which still leaves a lot of dick heads left in the army.

There was basically parity in Germany after Bayern. No one had consolidated anything. There are no sleeping giants of German football. 

Dortmund was shrewdly managed and Klopp was given time to get them places because there were no ridiculous expectations. If Rodgers gets 5th, which is most likely right now, it will mean he has finished exactly where our wage and investment structure has put us. Last year gave everyone the false impression we were capable of challenging for titles but we aren't. And the idea that if we got to the FA Cup final and lost or got to the last 16 and lost that he would be forgiven is nonsense. 

All you lot would be saying it was underachievement anyway. 

We underachieved in the CL. We should have gotten to the FA Cup final. But we could have drawn a giant in the CL and Arsenal just tore us new assholes.

Secondly, the biggest obstacle in the representation of young voters is the first past the post voting system. It'd be nice to believe we could vote under FPTP to bring down FPTP, but that's like trying to stop a treadmill by running on it. Voting systems are powered by participation and thus the higher the turnout, the more credibility it has. This includes spoilt ballots, which contribute to turnout figures and where ""none of the above"" is counted as ""voter intention uncertain"".

The reality is, two things make FPTP look bad. The biggest is hung parliaments, which we're almost guaranteed in this election (but still, people in swing seats should arguably vote for whoever would contribute to a hung parliament). The second is a low turn-out. It's a fact that a lot of people can't accept, but there is no way of voting in a safe seat that will contribute to the downfall of FPTP as much as not voting.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"Say what you will about Klopp and many of your points are reasonable, I don't think there's any denying that Klopp is generally considered a very good manager and he will no doubt be in demand and I don't think the same is quite as true about Rodgers at this stage of his career.  I find the comparisons between the two a bit embarrassing as simply put they're not really comparable and to me it's similar to comparing say Sterling, a young prospect with a lot of potential, to say Hazard, an older, more established player on the cusp of being world class.  This is not to say Sterling won't be better than Hazard or that Rodgers cannot become better than Klopp or even that either one would succeed where the other would not, but at this point in time the comparison isn't a fair one to either individual as they're at different stages in their respective careers.

Klopp has been managing first teams now for 14 years as well as having played professionally for Mainz for 12 years before taking over as manager.  Rodgers professional career ended at age 20 and he's only managed a first team for any club for 3.5 years prior to coming to Liverpool.  Simply put, he's just nowhere near as experienced as Klopp and that does show.

Now moving beyond pure numbers you've listed above all of which are fair in a way, I have to ask if you've watched Dortmund play?  Have you seen Klopp's in game tactics, his formation changes, his substitutions, how he sets up the side?  As someone who has watched Dortmund a great deal as well as obviously us a great deal, for me, Klopp is well beyond Rodgers in terms of actual football management, which for some reason neither side of this argument seems to discuss.  It's all about titles this, league position that, wage bill and other somewhat irrelevant nonsense instead of objectively looking at how good are the two at actual managing. 

All of that said, for me, it's largely irrelevant anyway as I don't think we stand a very good chance of getting Klopp regardless and I do think people are being overly optimistic about that.",null,0,null,1429933214,null,0,false,0,cqnxsi4,null,t3_33s63r,null,t1_cqnxsi4,null,t3_33s63r,null,null,null,1432590891,null,52,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,52,null

A starting striker, CM and an RB, perhaps a back up GK (not sure if that Irish keeper is going to be the back up) and they will be competitive next year, like they were this year for top four.  

Well if what you said is true, and they win nothing and he gets sacked and need a manager they have Frank DeBoer who is staying at Ajax another year and is a perfect (maybe even a better fit than Klopp in regards to style and fit with owners).  Not to mention that other managers that may be available.  

I can't see Liverpool winning champions league either.  Mainly due to the behemoths Madrid, Barca, Bayern not really BR.  We could have Jesus H. Christ on the touch line and he wouldn't be able to beat them.  

Obviously the threat of becoming a selling club is a real issue I agree.  But it might not be totally him.  FSG seem to want to implement a plan of younger players and lower wages.  So I don't know if you can blame him solely for this.  

Appointing Klopp would be great if we were already in the CL but we are not so all his experience isn't exactly useful.  The Prem is a difficult league with 6-7 teams that are established and competitive with only four spots, the Bundesliga is different.  

The way you win the league isn't with a one in a million player.  It is with a system, players that fit, and a strategy.  Like Chelsea this year.  

To put everything on Suarez last year is just wrong.  That isn't how football works.  You can't just put Suarez on fucking Burnley and think they will finish second.  

Now I was confused here.  Do you mean we played the same formation last year or this year?  Because last year they flirted with the 3-5-2 for a few games and moved around a bit before finding the 4-4-2 diamond as the most useful.  And if you are winning as often as they were why would you change the formation?  Also the formation changed throughout games, Agger would be put on to add three CB's at the back sometimes is just one example.  If it ain't broke...
This year they have played a few different variations, the 3-4-3 being the most successful, not quite sure what you are trying to get at.  To think that a manager's effort is simply picking where the players stand at kickoff, well, I don't really know what to say.  

While I concede our transfers haven't been glowing it is sort of hard to get everything right in the grand scheme of things due to [this](http://tomkinstimes.com/2014/06/tomkins-law-only-40-of-transfers-succeed)  But since BR took over Chelsea have spent 270.  Arsenal 185.  United 317.  City 217.  Some of those squads already built.  Liverpool are almost a completely different team.  But again ideas about wage and contract structures influence this heavily.  

To say that ""top 4 wouldn't be an issue"" is greatly disrespectful to the other teams in the top four and not realistic as to how things work in the real world.

This is being forgotten because of how ""shiny"" of a new toy Klopp would be. What's interesting about this whole situation is so little of the focus is on Brendan, positive or negative focus. I feel the focus is entirely on the somewhat unquantified appeal of Klopp. And to endorse the move  so whimsically is very dangerous (for anyone, not just Klopp).

Your saying ""considered"" a good manager is the main problem with all these arguments. As Liverpool fans, I'm sure we're not really taking in just how much praise Rodgers gets around the world. People were sucking Rodgers dick last year - more than us. Even this year you won't find any fans outside Liverpool who are genuine saying we should sack Rodgers. 

Rodgers was being bandied about as a Barca manager this past summer. When it's happening to you, you care a lot more. You're more emotional about it. That's the key. Fans are being emotional. Klopp may be a good coach, but I don't think his success (or name) are proof that he would be better than Rodgers. I'm not sure he'd even be as good as Rodgers.

Signing players has everything to do with what we're willing to pay in transfer fees on a single player (less than the top four sides), wages (less than the top four sides), offering CL, and past that location.

They have been floating a move to Hong Kong for a few years now, which sounds like a nice threat given then history of the company and the flat tax rates there... but is it really that sensible to HQ a business essentially in Communist China, which Hong Kong essentially is these days.

If anything, the trend is for Chinese companies to buy American shells and reverse engineer out of China to HQ and list in the US and Europe, so they can get away from Communist China government oversight.

I wonder how much tax they pay in the UK, or if they benefit from EU loopholes in Luxembourg like Amazon and co.

For what its worth, I'd stay in the EU and continue to agitate for reform. In this I think Cameron has done a brilliant job.

I'm not certain about this, but I believe slavery was abolished in effect in catholic countries such as France from a much earlier ruling just like England. And that while England's laws were being tested with the result of freeing slaves who went there, the same thing was happening in France with slaves being free within France. Both still allowed it to go on in their colonies, and I think this is where Britain before most others went above convention and started actively trying to stop slavery within their colonies and territories.

Some examples of police intervention in mental health:

The police came across someone with a history of attempted suicide sitting on the railing of a bridge. They (quite rightly) brought her in for psychiatric assessment and would need to stay with her until this was completed. 

A fairly standard one is someone who's acting bizarrely on a night out and is reported to the police (sometimes - but not only - because they're violent). If the police aren't sure the effect is due to intoxication they can ask for a psychiatric assessment.  Occasionally it's not booze or drugs. 

Another time someone called the ward to say they were about to take an overdose because they'd had enough. She wouldn't say where. We obviously had to call the police to her them to look for her.

Another time someone absconded when they were in no fit state to be out. Again we had to call the police to search for them. 

These are services the police provide pretty exclusively. My examples are from a while back but I haven't really heard anything suggesting the police are filling in any new gaps in mental health coverage.

Electoral reform. Everything stems from the underlying system and we would be able to make parties much more responsive to the people if we had a modern approach to it. 

&gt; How would you address the huge gap in funding between London/rUK? 

Regionalisation and balance out the funding to invest more in the midlands and the north. HS2 is crap, use that money to support the other cities better. London is a vampire and we need to rebalance. 

&gt; Would you agree with more diversification of the economy as a buffer for future economic downturns (due to the high % of GDP tied up in the financial sector)?

Absolutely. We have a great background in education, science and R&amp;D, use that bedrock to build progressive, leading industries that are at the forefront of industrial and commercial development.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Do you have any stats/precedent for this? I would be interested to see, but otherwise I am not sure I would be so confident. 

The Housing Act creates statutory periodic tenancies when a fixed term tenancy ends - however there is a carve out to this where the tenancy agreement itself creates a contractual periodic tenancy. I agree if the tenancy agreement is silent on a periodic tenancy no notice is given. However, this section of the Housing Act creates a right to stay not a right to leave (else a tenant could become a trespasser which is not desirable!). Therefore I don't think this section of the Housing Act alone would get you home where a contractual periodic tenancy arises. *Arguably* if the contract envisages it will continue the tenancy does not end after the fixed term portion. 

There is some commentary that it *could* be an unfair term to have a peridoc tenancy arise automatically unless notice is given, but I'm not sure it is clear cut. The clarity, reasonableness, and prominence of the requirement to give notice could play a roll - especially if the landlord/letting agent wrote to the tenant (one tenancy agreemen I had statws in it they would write to me - bringing that into the contract itself). There is no doubt it would be worth arguing, and in a lot of these cases the sympathy of the court/arbitrator is with the tenant! Just I'm not sure if ""every time"" is stating it a bit highly. 

Outside of the legalities, this is actually one of the rare times I have sympathy with a landlord - they should be able to know if a tenant intends to leave or stay before they are actually out the door. A letting agent writing to a tenant, and the tenant writing a short letter/email one month before their tenancy ends does not seem burdensome. Else, we could end up in a nasty situation where landlords start s.21-ing people by default towards the end of their fixed terms.

null,false,RushsMustache,lfc68,,null,"There's an argument that suggests that Suarez was the reason we had the freedom to play like that however. Suarez' movement and ability to go around almost anyone often meant that opposition defenders would have to sit deeper. 

His ability to score seemingly from wherever he wanted also often meant that teams would double up defenders on him. 

I'm not taking anything away from the contributions of Sturridge, Sterling, Gerrard etc but all of the above opened up a great deal of space on the pitch to allow them to play the fast moving, quick passing game that brought so much success.

With him gone the fear isn't there any more, opposition players aren't afraid to push up and press Liverpool, stifling their ability to play the quick moving and passing game they like. Persisting with that same system in the face of that pressing resulted in all the passing between the defenders and keeper that frustrated everyone so much at the start of the season. 

Consequently, Gerrard doesn't get the space to make the passes he was last season, too few players are getting up to support Sterling and Coutinho and pull defenders away opening up space for them to exploit.  

Had Sturridge been fit it would have been interesting to see just how much things would have continued on from last season.

null,false,bloop24,lfc99,,null,"Oh I certainly agree that having Suarez on the pitch allowed all of our players more room and freedom.  But Sturridge last season also had the ability to score from anywhere(albeit not quite to the same level as Suarez) and his explosive pace allowed for it as well.  Without both Sturridge and Suarez up top I think we would have had to play an entirely different style of football.  

There's also something to be said that Gerrard's ability to pick the right pass from deep forced defenders to sit deeper since they knew he could play that killer ball 9 times out of 10 to players that could finish the chance 9 times out of 10.

I have been saying all season to my friends and maybe on here I'm not sure I've actually posted anything about it that we need a player that is able to put that fear into defences like Suarez and Sturridge did last season.  

It may be because our squad is so young or whatever but we also seem to lose the will to win the game sometimes.  That is one thing I think that you 100% cannot attribute to anything other than Suarez's presence on the pitch though.  He never stopped wanting to win the game and that gave the entire team that will to just push on.  

While Suarez certainly was a big part of last season the team as a whole just plain had more fight to it than this season imo.  We aren't playing that same almost manic pressing game we were before.  

If Sturridge stayed fit this season I honestly think he would have kept on right where he left off last season.  His injuries this season just killed the momentum we had from last season and with it a lot of our teams confidence I think.

My point is I think it was more the team as a whole that allowed for us to have the freedom and room for players to do what they're good at.  When you have the confidence in your forwards like we did last season it allows the entire team to play more aggressively because they know that there are players there that will be on the end of forward passes and through balls.  Also when your forwards have the confidence in the players supplying those balls forward that Suarez and Sturridge had it allows them to play more aggressively because they know if they make the run more times than not the ball will get played to them.  The team as a whole came together last season and it was magnificent to watch attacking players who all had so much confidence in each other.",null,0,null,1429953421,null,0,false,0,cqo3qoz,null,t3_33rtmo,null,t1_cqo3qoz,null,t1_cqo3efi,null,null,null,1432593763,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null
