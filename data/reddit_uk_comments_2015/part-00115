null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"&gt; The cable is officially rated to 27A but in reality is able to take much more before becoming dangerous.

Tell me about it, my kitchen was incorrectly wired and everything ran off a 15A cable for 20+ years before I discovered it a year after moving in. The wire got physically warm with just the oven on but didn't actually catch fire. 

I still have 40s/50s lead-wrapped wires here in places, if I were planing on staying in this flat long-term I'd fix it but meh, not my problem. ;-) Breaker box is still using wired fuses! When one broke I thought I'd be SOL getting more but it seems many local shops carry it so it must be far more common than I though.

&gt; I'm not sure how you can wire it incorrectly at the box either, if it is wrong it won't work in the first place. 

If a ring main is hooked up to the box as a radial then it would still work but be technically ""unsafe"".

&gt;  It's not illegal for a non spark to work on their own house. 

It is to a degree, the law changed a two years ago with the ""Part P"" changes. You can do basic wiring but you must have a certified spark sign off on it before powering it up.

He took to the field like a hockey player and wanted to instantly add heat to the affair - which he obviously had when we saw Herrera fly in to the tackle like he did.  So many fans demanding an apology stunned me; the only thing he should have apologised for was losing the fight he had every right to start by getting sent off.

I want LFC players to carry themselves a certain way but Utd games are a different matter - you don't sign for either team without being ready to be either a) broken or b) sent off in that game.  If you're not ready for it you can be fucked off at the first opportunity.  This sub is a joke when we lose and I stay away, which is why I'm only saying it now.

And don't get me started on the double standards of so many internet fans having seemingly no problem with an LFC player racially abusing a Utd player, but when it comes to stepping up the competition in one of the bitterest games in the world - one which the officials were determined to referee like a pre-season MLS game - suddenly *Steven fucking Gerrard* needs to apologise.

I know this is some sort of off topic thread or something but whatever, needed said.

""Nadya Budaya"" is ace (Malay), ""Loch Fyne"" fish (sorta Scots), ""Ye old trip to Jerusalem"" is worth a visit for the location, but the food is a bit hit and miss in my experience. If you're at University of Nottingham main campus you'll be near Beeston, so try the Victoria Inn (great food, beer and cider).

Beer (i.e. real ale, proper beer with actual *flavour* a bit like ""craft beer"" in the USA) is served at cellar temperature. Not ""warm"". Learn to deal with it. :-)

Piece of advice. GB is Scotland, Wales and England. The UK is GB + N.Ireland etc. The Irish, Scots and Welsh are not English. You *do not* want to make that mistake. If you do, one of two things will happen:

1. You'll end up in a fight; or
2. People will rip the piss out of you mercilessly for ever more. [The most likely]

More advice: we use words differently. ""Pavement"" is where one walks, not drives (that's the ""road""). ""Football"" is what you would call ""soccer"". ""Fanny"" is not what you think it is and *do not* tell someone they are ""double fisting"" simply because they are holding two beers (see item 2 above).

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; Does aviation offer that kind of flexibility all the time? Genuine question, I'm amazed it's that easy if you're a PPL.

If the weather is good, and you can be 'VFR' then yes.  If the weather isn't so nice, and you need to be 'IFR' then sort of.  VFR, or visual flight rules, the pilot is entirely responsible for deconfliction, not hitting anything.  Now IFR or instrument flight rules, which is when you have IMC or Instrument Meteorological Conditions, fog, low cloud, rain, etc.  Then it's not quite so clear, you have to submit a flight plan, but in practice, that can be as little as 30 min before departure without much hassle.  The rules around this get complex, as I hold two licenses I can also pick and choose which sets of rules I want to use.  I'm also VFR only, I want to take some time off and get my instrument rating, but alas I can either have spare time, or spare money, not both.

Now, you have a host of other things, you have to by law have a re-test every 2 years, the club I belong to makes that 6 months, if you've not flown for more than 30 days, they will not rent to you without an instructor.  By law, I must have made 3 take offs and landings, in daylight and nighttime to take passengers.  Now that is in each 'type' of plane too.  As such, I'm normally only current in two types at most.

I also don't own, I just rent, so this makes availability of craft an issue, if see a very nice weather system approaching, you can bet that a fair few other people will have too.  Luckily the club I'm a member of isn't really for profit, and has generally good availability, despite it's proximity to London.

&gt; Yeah cars will always be more flexible, agreed. The cheap weekend upgrade offers are a good idea on the trains though.

But the issue for me is, that cars cost less.  When you look at the subsidy per mile, trains are shockingly bad in our country.  So for spontaneous things they are bad.  The one time they are inarguably better is say, going to central London at 8:30am.  That's also a good time people will happily pay that premium.

To me, we need to ensure that any rail we build is efficient, very much so.  In my lifetime I'm expecting cars to switch to self driving, and probably away from petroleum.  It's best we don't get to bought into legacy rail.  I can't comprehend how it's so expensive to run a train on a rail, yet it's looking like it will be cheaper to self drive a car on the road.

I've had half a dozen leaflets from the big three parties all bitching about the others and ""HOW THEYRE GOING TO RUIN BRITAIN!"" and NOTHING on how theyre better.

Conservative are flat out recycling their last election material (""Were going to add 3million apprenticeships by 2015!"" - Fact they failed abysmally only reaching 900k and only 9% of those succeeded in creating work)

Ukip sent me one. Saying what they aim to do and if they fail they're sorry. No tarring of the other parties. Infact UKIP spend so much of their time pruning their own party and dotting the Ts and I's (besides farage + close chums engaging mouth before brain), compared to the big three just repeating their old mantras and hating on the new guy.

As for the ""BNP"" lot chucking in with UKIP. I speculate thats purely because they know BNP is dead in the water and theyre just attaching to the next closest ideology. Does it make that ideology racist? Nah. I mean if you honestly think like that, then I imagine you're the same people who still believe Australia is a penal colony.

Yes, this is broadly correct, although most of the world uses the same electrical standards as Europe (220-240 V, 50Hz). It's mainly only North America and Japan that use 110-120V, 60 Hz. 

British plugs are quite unique because of the inclusion of individual fuses, which begets their rather large size, but this is a result of British wiring practices because (as you say) there was an acute copper shortage after the Second World War and the UK developed a different way of wiring things.

Historically, since around 1947 or so, most buildings in the UK have used [ring circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_circuit). This is where you basically have a single circuit that loops all around one floor of a house. For example, on a typical two-storey house, you might have the following circuits:

* downstairs sockets
* downstairs lights (lights often use radial circuits instead of rings)
* upstairs sockets
* upstairs lights
* cooker
* boiler (although not always)
* maybe an extra depending on what else is in the house

If you look on your consumer unit and only see around six or seven switches, then your house uses ring circuits. The problem with this is that it offers little protection against a surge from an individual appliance if you've got potentially dozens of objects plugged into one circuit. In most of the rest of the world, radial circuits are used, which tend to get broken down by room, so you might have living room sockets, living room lights, master bedroom sockets, master bedroom lights, etc. If your consumer unit has well over 20 or so switches on it, it probably uses radial circuits. These render the fuses in British plugs somewhat redundant, since it's an extra precaution to protect against faults on a circuit that probably only has two or three things plugged into it at any given time.

So yes, British plugs are excellent, but they need to be because of the UK's wiring standards. I also think that most European plugs are fantastic as well. The German and French designs perform perfectly well with radial circuits, and have the added benefits of being recessed into the socket so that nothing can make contact with the pins until the plug has been pulled out far enough that contact has been lost anyway. I'm particularly fond of [the Swiss design](http://www.qiao-pu.com/upload/file/images/20120610204834.jpg). It does the best job of making use of modern injection moulding technology to create a plug that has an earth connection but is still comparably small compared to the older and larger French and German designs. Still, they're all quite nice, and most European plugs with an earth connection also have a cable that runs flush with the wall as well, which is an obvious improvement.

By far, the plugs I cannot stand the most are American ones. They're horrendously bad. Absolutely no insulation on the pins, and they're not recessed, meaning they can easily come [partly dislodged from the socket but still maintain a connection](http://p-fst2.pixstatic.com/506af369dbd0cb306100187e._w.540_s.fit_.jpg). They also have incredibly flimsy pins [that are very easy to bend](http://i.imgur.com/YGCX9vG.jpg). Even with their three-pin earthed plugs, they [mount them the wrong way round](http://images.wisegeek.com/standard-us-power-outlet.jpg), with the earth on bottom and the live and neutral pins on top. Given the propensity of the plugs to come loose and fall slightly out of place, you can probably already see why this is a problem. If something like a paperclip or a [coin were to fall down on the plug and make contact with the live and neutral pins](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2ydtey/a_dime_fell_off_of_my_dresser_and_landed_directly/), you can have a serious fire hazard. This is surprisingly common enough that many landlords in the US have started installing sockets 'upside down' with the earth pin facing up (as in the UK) so that these sorts of accidents are much less common.

It's worth nothing that Australia/New Zealand plugs [have many of these same problems](http://electrical-contractor.net/PC/AU_us_plug2.JPG), due to the fact that their plug is really just [an old American 240V design that goes back to 1916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS/NZS_3112#Origins). However, they at least have the safety option of switches on their sockets like the UK does, and their newer plugs have a couple additional safety benefits.

So in summary, yes UK plugs and sockets are excellent, but they have to be in order to compensate for the unique wiring situation that's found almost uniquely in the UK (and is why the UK couldn't conceivably adopt another European standard even if it wanted to without rewiring damn near every building in the country). However, most other plugs, especially the European ones, are also excellent and do just as good of a job given their own wiring situations and the ways in which they are used. However, I think we can all reasonably conclude that American plugs are utterly horrific, cheaply-made, unsafe and just generally extremely, extremely poor.",null,0,null,1427477590,null,0,1427477864,0,cpspp6a,null,t3_30gydc,null,t1_cpspp6a,null,t1_cpsd03m,null,null,null,1432048046,null,34,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,34,null

In what way do you imagine that the two conflict?

The question in relation to our beloved bakery then is simply whether refusing to bake a cake for someone - because you don't like the message, or you don't like gays, or you don't like the man's face - is infringing their liberty. Clearly it isn't. 

Whereas saying to a business that they have to provide a service of a particular kind clearly is infringing their liberty, their freedom of conscience, freedom of association, and freedom of trade.

Also, whether something is natural or not is completely irrelevant to the question at hand. Suppose that being gay was a simply choice, in what way would that imply that others should be allowed to interfere with that choice? Whether people are gay because of biology, upbringing, or a free choice, other people bumming each other doesn't infringe my liberty, so whether I think it's gross or I think it's super I've no business in trying to legislate against it. Equally, if other people want to believe in Creationism or believe that being gay is evil, then they have a perfect right to do so, so long as they don't infringe gay people's liberty (e.g., by murdering them, legislating against sodomy, etc.).

That's my two cents anyway.

We have the slutty costumes and teenagers showing up for sweets, but it's not as much of a big deal here. We don't really have display and costume stores, for example. Also, decoration is basically a pumpkin for most people. Unless you are having a party, then you might put a little bit more up. 

&gt; Christmas is basically an excuse for us to eat and drink copiously with our families, which is fine by me, but what about in the UK? 

Same. We do have some traditions that are different to the US though, we have mince pies, Christmas crackers (cardboard tubes that two people pull and whoever gets the bigger side gets a prize, a crap joke and a paper crown, which you must wear at the dinner table), and advent calendars (A calendar with a doors that you open from the 1st December until Christmas, usually with a chocolate in each day)

&gt; Do the English also have ugly sweater parties and humongous Christmas light displays on their houses?

Yes! Although not parties - you might get a ""Christmas jumper"" day at work. The lights are pretty common. 

&gt; And what about Thanksgiving? Is it pretty much centered around food and pumpkin-spice-flavored everything and American football?

We don't celebrate it here. I believe it's only the US and Canada where they do.

&gt; And a metric shitload of Christmas music, starting around Thanksgiving?

You'll start hearing Christmas music everywhere in late November/Early December on the radio. You'll start to see Christmas decorations go up after Bonfire night (5th November) although most people wait until December.

&gt; And what about New Year's? What do you do in the UK to ring in the new year? Champagne and fireworks?

Pretty much the same. I don't think there will be any traditions here that are different to the US. Although it's a really big deal in Scotland, they have loads of traditions.

I'm now home, struggling to get a job anywhere in my field, and the loan repayments have now started and it's really scary having $35,000 hanging over your head. The other side of this debt and the repayments is that it's so hard to save up for other things like a car or a down payment or travel when you have to pay so much back every month. Long story short, I did it and I somewhat enjoyed my experience. However, if I had been in a field like engineering where I would have gotten a high paying job ASAP and maybe even could have lived with my parents while I quickly paid off my debt than it would have been more worth it.

i know we'll never sign the di maria's, mata's, costa's blah blah blah blah...those guys don't have 'that desire' that we so desparately are looking for. i guarantee you if we can keep hold of sturridge, sterling and coutinho this summer, things will be just fine and we will add some key pieces. i also fully believe that unless raheem says he will kill himself in liverpool if we don't sell him, he will be a red one way or another. FSG has proven it's strength and they have 2.1 billion dollars in value across the pond (and that's just the red sox, not even including the television station they own or the boston globe..). they have money. they have power. we will hold onto our stars unlike arsenal and we will take one more crack at it next season. if we don't succeed next season fsg i think will scrap BR and the current project and sell off some big names, but until the season ends there, we will not see fsg waiver in this project. they know what giving up on someone as good as BR means and they know how the fans feel currently, but they are playing a tight balancing act that most fans will never come to grips with. 

anyways sorry for the rant, but there are plenty of star players who would come to liverpool. our wages we can pay are better than every team world wide bar maybe 15 of them. and what we have that others don't is an unbelievable platform for someone to step up and be the man of liverpool, that's an honor to a lot of true footballers who understand the rich tradition this sport carries. no, there will never be another gerrard, but there will always be another legend. we have a crop of youngsters who have this platform to build off of, and if the team performed better in just 3-4 games, we would be not too far off of first.",null,0,null,1427479717,null,0,false,0,cpsr1pd,null,t3_30h8j6,null,t1_cpsr1pd,null,t1_cpspnaz,null,null,null,1432048751,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

IEC c14 and c13 and it's high voltage/amperage variants. They are safe as they have a plastic shield that prevents anything from getting between the metal pins. The electrical contact is shielded right from the get go. The shield also provides a more physical connection to prevent the plug from falling out, makes it hard for debris to get in and if you have a rubber seal prevents moisture from getting in too. They are also highly more compact then the British plugs and don't have that fall on the floor with the prongs straight up. British plugs do have fuses but that can be added. There's a reason why these are used by servers and always on equipment, they can lock too.

Salt water is good at conducting, because there's tons of salt and stuff in it.

Electricity, however, looks for a path to ground. Even if the insulation failed, the electricity would make for the sea bed through the least resistive path possible: not many fish would die.

This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of employees of the various instituions and companies. Please feel free to move about the train or simply sit back and enjoy the ride.

The time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 12 degrees Centigrade, with an estimated high of 16. London is maintained at a clement 15 degrees centigrade at all times.

This train is inbound from Lewisham to Bank. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Heathrow, you will need to return to Bank, take the Central line to Holborn and board the Picadilly Line. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the HM Passport Office, you must report to the HM Passport Office for processing before you will be permitted into the most painful areas of the British mass transit system.

Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in Central London, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the A406 ring road.

Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives.

A reminder that the London Marathon will commence this on the 26th of April 2015. The semifinals for high-security personnel will be announced in a separate Secure Access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.

Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the TFL team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of Dangerous Bus Driving and Letting People Whose Oyster Cards Don't Work Through The Gates. Please contact TFL for further information. If you have an associate with a background in the areas of theoretical physics, biotechnology or other high-tech disciplines, please don't bother them about applying, as they are probably in better paid jobs. The TFL is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

A reminder to all London employees: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Central London. Missing a scheduled urinalysis or radiation check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other hazardous materials in the course of your duties, contact your Radiation Safety Officer immediately. Work safe, work smart. Your future depends on it.

Please stand back from the automated door and wait for the me to tell you to Mind The Gap. Before exiting the train, be sure to shove your way past the hordes trying to board.

null,false,MatthewWilkes,null,null,null,"1) No, because they're not real divisions any more. It was once that the location you gave would be (one of) your estates, but now it's just to differentiate you. The name is agreed as part of the appointment process and is generally an important location for that person, such as place of birth, long-term residence or constituency (for former representatives).

2) No. Some of the older peerages may well because the family is likely to own a lot of land and be well respected in the area, but in general having a peerage doesn't get you any power over real people.

3) No. All life peers have the right to sit in the lords but before they can start they need to be introduced by two other lords. This is a formality, but if it isn't done they don't have the right to sit in the lords. To be introduced they need [to buy or hire](http://www.edeandravenscroft.com/ceremonial-dress/peers-robes/) some parliamentary robes that match the rank of their peerage and make a short speech.

4) There are elections among hereditary peers to decide which of them get to sit in the lords. There are less than a hundred of them. This is what Tony Benn's son wants to do, having reclaimed his hereditary peerage that his dad renounced to be an MP.

5) Not *completely*. The law governing titles of nobility is different but at this level it's practically the same. The main differences are between clans and arms. The main issues are around edge cases for hereditary peers but there's no substantial differences for the lords.

6) The Australians have just started knighting people again. The Canadians never stopped. Neither country has a house of lords, any peers created from their citizens are entitled to sit in the UK HoL, such as Baron Beaverbrook of New Brunswick (I love that name). Generally speaking they won't be created a peer unless they've got some relation to the UK, though, as the country specific higher awards would be used.

null,false,Hhhaamuus,null,null,null,"&gt; By the logic you are proposing because I introduced the danger (the bat) I am at fault, despite the fact the other party broke the law.

I'm not the poster, but I think you missed their point a bit - they said you would be at fault until you both go to court.

That is also true in the scenario you described. If you had no proof he tried to mug you, you would go down for a long time!

But more likely you could introduce evidence that proves you had no motive and were simply walking home, and he possibly might have had motive, or previous history, or some scratches on you, or a weapon on him etc. If there were no witnesses, you having the bat and winning the fight by beating the other guy with it looks very suspicious so we would need to know circumstance.

I think you are overreacting to the definition of a car as introducing danger - it is, from a legal point of view. It's a bit like assuming an unarmed person wouldn't have chosen to fight someone who had a cricket bat, if you have no other knowledge of the case. With no other factors the bat counts as one against you, you had a weapon. It's just legal technicality.

But this isn't even about that. It's just because right now all drivers are insured, but cyclists aren't, which makes the driver have an unfair legal advantage in disputes and prevents many cyclists claiming in winnable cases.

We only brought him in to revitalize Torres by any means necessary. What he ended up doing was warming up to the top players of the future, aka Hazard, Mata, Oscar, and of course, Torres, but at the same time not treating players during his Liverpool era with enough respect, aka JT. 

I always said this during Benitez's time that JT wasn't playing anywhere near as well as I know he could because Benitez was deliberately sabotaging him due to personal differences. It was the same with Ba. Despite scoring at almost a goal per game pace for his first 4-5 matches, Benitez suddenly dropped him for Torres and only kept playing Ba in FA Cup matches or bringing him on as a sub during the dying embers. 

Yeah sure he brought us to CL spot, but his points per game tally will confirm that his record wasn't much better than RDM's and we were genuinely at a threat of losing that spot *after* Benitez arrived. Remember, when Benitez he took over we were still 2nd in the table and we ended up dropping down much further. That's why I feel the general media gives him too much credit, which is most likely because he is a beloved ex-Liverpool manager. So this was their chance of showing that he ""saved"" Chelsea. No, he didn't. And we were always the favourites to win the Europa Cup after getting knocked down too. So its not as though he pulled a rabbit out of the hat. He did a reasonable job and that's it.

You would have thought that gay men would toe the feminist intersectionalist line about Islam and that they shouldn't let a little thing like being stoned to death deter them.  But, incredibly, it appears that some gay men just don't care enough about their sisters to comply.

Of course - feminism has an answer for this.  It turns out that gay men are suffering from 'institutionalized misogyny' on account of being men.  It's also been discovered that many gays in the West are white.  (Alas, some feminists are white too, but it's OK, because as women, even middle class college girls suffer as much under the patriarchy as blacks have ever suffered under racism.)  

It's also the case that many gays seem to be quite well off.  Much better off for instance, than women with gender-studies degrees.  (It would be cruel to think that's because homoesexuals often have inordinately high IQ's, whereas gender warriors tend toward the middle of the bell-curve.)  Anyway, the fact that these homosexuals are high earners compared to social studies graduates who end up in Starbucks and who just can't seem to catch a break at IBM would suggest that gays are fully benefitting from patriarchal oppression.

&gt; Ditch the home phone which costs line rental, get a cheap broadband only deal.

You will pay almost as much or more for any high-allowance or high-speed connection on broadband only. Virgin's top speed broadband will cost you £41/mo on it's own, or £38.24/mo for 12 months and even after the introductory rate is £46.99 - your phone line, which comes with unlimited weekend calls, is costing you £5.99/mo at that point - if you keep both services for 18 months you have saved £13.94 on the broadband and phone vs broadband alone.

I can't find anyone else who offers broadband only - although plusnet will let you have naked broadband, they'll still charge you for line rental.

null,false,scisess,null,null,null,"I agree with what /u/Firefox7275 has said already, you have 3 cleansers here and no moisturiser or sunscreen! Take it easy with introducing everything at once, especially without moisturiser you could just end up stripping your skin dry.

I use a couple of those products in my PM routine when I need to remove makeup. Firstly I take the First Touch Baby Oil and rub it all over my face and (closed!) eyes to take off my makeup/sunscreen. Then I use a damp microfibre cloth to very gently remove the dirty oil. I use the Simply Sensitive Foaming Cleansing Wash to double-cleanse and ensure that all the oil and dirt/makeup/sunscreen is gone. I rinse with cool water then apply actives, serums and moisturisers last.

For you I would suggest eventually you want a similar routine:

On days when you're in a hurry/don't have to remove layers of makeup/sunscreen/sweat/dirt/grime, just use the regular Cleansing Lotion. This could also be your AM cleanser (I find I don't need a proper cleanser in the morning, just rinsing with water is usually enough).

On OCM days: First Touch Baby Oil, followed by Foaming Cleansing Wash.

Then depending on what your skin needs that day, you can add the Mask or Toner. Do you have a moisturiser? That would go last. Or you can take a couple drops of the baby oil and rub that in as a moisturiser.

I think you really need to add in products one at a time, patch testing first, to ensure that you don't have problems down the line. If you find that one of these steps dries you out/irritates you/clogs you up then you'll have to discontinue each thing one by one to find out what's causing the issue and that's a bloody nightmare! Try waiting at least 2 weeks between each new product. I try to test things for over a month on just one side of my face so I can see exactly what effect they're having, but I appreciate that not everyone feels they have time for that, especially when you're trying to develop a brand new routine!

This story was on the BBC NI site recently. Worth reading if you're considering coming over for it. TL:DR version is: Head as far north as you can, avoid everything and everyone possible and expect your camera to do a better job seeing the lights than the naked eye.

It's possible and there are sites that track the likelihood of seeing the northern lights

but i'd imagine we're a bit more of a gamble than somewhere more nothern such as Norway, even the top of Scotland would probably be better positioned i think.

Come in the winter, monitor the site and be prepared to drive out somewhere in the sticks.  If all else fails you just get a few pints in the pub and have some craic while your here.

Through the peace process, consent has been obtained that the status quo remains on the condition that if the north votes for reunification, the British will ensure that it's implemented. So right now, no, it's not justified, not as long as the path to peaceful reunification remains open.

She didn't suggest taking it by force - she's advocating for more open debate and discussion on the matter in the south.

I don't think the rest of the UK would see it as an attack on Britain either, seeing as at the height of the troubles something like 65-70% were in favour of reunification over here, and anytime ye go over to Britain they'll be the first to call you Paddy and Mick etc, even if you told them you were British.

&gt; Any kind of war would see Britain crush any rebels and if the Republic got involved it'd be absolutely steamrolled by Britain. Hell, it could even have Britain occupy the south if the ROI started fighting or taking an active role in some sort of revolution.

True, true - but there are other aspects that would come into it - traditionally the armed struggle during the Troubles has been commemorated by countless governments the world over (Bobby Sands for example is commemorated in places like Cuba, France, Iran, and countless other places). So any incursion by Britain into the south would be very *very* unpopular with the international community (especially as the Irish seem to have the worlds most insanely spread out and numerous diaspora) - it would probably end up with Britain being a bit of a pariah and a good few sanctions placed on it.

If the army came over here again to crush any rebellion it would most likely end up being broadcast to the world like it was during the Troubles too - a quasi-colonial army oppressing a native populace. The media has a thing with developing narratives in conflicts, and once one is established (like it has been here), they are unlikely to change the story, as it involves too much explanation and not enough images of guns and bombs going off.

Perhaps not in the conventional means (IE weapons and bombs), but any military action by Britain in the Republic would probably end up with *M*utually *A*ssured *D*estruction.

As I stated, I did run a search both in this sub and the non-UK SCA (I am a very regular reader of both these subs, honestly I HAVE done research and I HAVE read both sidebars) but the two threads that come up in this sub were both from people looking to try the Oilatum cream for the first time and asking if it was right for them, NOT people in my situation trying to find a dupe for it!

to leave the contract, several bereavements (including being a witness at my uncle's wedding at his deathbed in the local cancer ward), and the stress of caring. 

I've worked all my life and supported my partner. 

The DWP 'lost' all our documents, blamed us, and sent us to the civil penalties board for a overpayment. But they did't pay ANY money for five months. Five months without money for the DWP's mistake. And when I pushed the formal complaint they spent 45mins trying to convince me not to. 

Finally after showing that I had photocopied and sent everything by recorded delivery and could prove it they caved. Unfortunately they still wont include my national insurance contributions (worked 40+ hrs per week for YEARS) and have decided that we should a reduction of £60 per week for unknown reasons. 

The icing on the cake? They have put me on JSA. Despite Med Cert. 

So to hear that it will be taxed on top is not surprising. 

Why is this important? I've done everything right, worked hard, saved a little (£2K all gone now) and 'done right' by my community. And have been left out to dry.

You will be on your own and you better be damn sure you have a rich family or you will have to sell your possession's for food. 

As all the national insurance and tax won't be used to help you when you are ill or need it I don't see why I should pay so much tax or contributions, when I return to work (I want to return to work, but the Doc won't let me yet).

The insidious way the conservatives have ripped out the welfare for the needy is clever, now I also want a smaller state and smaller welfare system so I can get taxed less and therefore plan for emergencies.

Actually the guilt makes it worse and prolongs the time off - reduced hours massively reduces my time off, because I'm not rendered incapable by the guilt that I'm not on on time. Normally caused by failing to get up at the first alarm (or some other normal morning sluggishness), then crying over how useless I am for this perceived failure, leading to me being late, leading to more guilt and the logical conclusion that suicide is the only answer and another lost day. Yeah, it's that stupid. 

So I 'officially' start at 12 now, I'm normally there first thing but if I'm 'late' it doesn't matter and I don't feel so much like I should kill myself over the mistake because I'm not officially late. Similarly being able to work from home removes the pressure if I'm not up to leaving the house. I'm surprised what a difference it makes. 

This only works on the way it or out of an episode, at my worst I'm just a shell and not a human at all, although dealing with it when it starts helps avoid this stage.

 [**Toilet paper orientation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet%20paper%20orientation): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;[Toilet paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper) when used with a [toilet roll holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_roll_holder) with a horizontal [axle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle) [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry\)) to the floor and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the [toilet paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper) may hang *over* (in front of) or *under* (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology\)). In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70 percent of respondents prefer *over*. 

&gt;While many people consider this topic unimportant, some hold strong opinions on the matter. Advice columnist [Ann Landers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Landers) said that the subject was the most controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, the ease of detaching individual squares, and compatibility with a [recreational vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle) or a [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat). Celebrities are found on both sides. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status. 

&gt;Solutions range from compromise, to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely, or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.

Do I really have to give you a lesson on the Conservative Party and its links to the economic elite? I will give you the credit of knowing this link, but wonder why you can't make the leap to link the funding of the party suggesting these policies to the policies they suggest, or why you don't have the intellectual curiosity to look in it.

&gt;Oh, and you realise ""the elite"" already pay more tax than you do or ever will, right? And their tax has done more to help the poor than you ever have or will? 

What tax bracket do you think I am in? I am paying the same proportion of tax as the elite (actually less as they wouldn't be so foolish as to pay income tax, they earn their money other ways). I am asking for a tax rise which would affect myself, so what exactly is your point here?

&gt;And there is no grand conspiracy?

No of course there isn't, that's why we cut the top tax rate so the rich could have more money, while simultaneously reducing the amount of money for the less well off in an amazing coincidence. It's not a conspiracy that the majority of Tory donors are in that tax bracket, and therefore directly benefited from the policy.

&gt;Only on reddit could someone talk like this and not just be laughed out the room.

One of their policies was lowering the tax rate for the rich. Another is introducing a much harsher and more extreme version of Labours benefit.

It's not people sitting in a bunker surrounded by gargoyle statues, it's rich people wanting more money, and lobbying for laws through their contacts, through the clubs they attend, through the access they get via donations.

I can't believe anyone in this day and age is trying to deny the link between money and political policy. It's ridiculous.

&gt;And I assumed you were on a lower tax bracket because I've never met anyone with money with such a complex about ""the elite"". 

So you've never met a compassionate person who has a good job? What a life you live.

&gt;Oh and top tax rate? Labour were saints were they? Or did you forget what taxes were like for the vast majority of their tenure?

Sorry, where did I say Labour were saints? Only someone with absolutely no personal argument just churns out tired old lines and assumptions and thinks they have the upper hand.

There is nothing you could tell me that I wouldn't believe about the depths of American stupidity. Three quick examples.

1. ""
How long would it take you to drive from London to Los Angeles? Would it just be easier to fly?""

2. After making the mistake of telling a southern woman her items would be with her before 1300 tomorrow. ""What time is that sir? Our clocks only go up to twelve... ""
3. ""...and how does your name appear on the card""

""It's silver and sticks out the front""

Anyway about 80% of them would wish me a happy Thanksgiving - it wasn't worth correcting them. However some people would ask what your Thanksgiving plans were and then you'd have no choice but to explain to them. I had one woman who couldn't fathom that British people didn't celebrate Thanksgiving. She went through stages of processing it. She thought i was joking, then she became really angry before finally finding it funny. Its really hard to be professional and not belittle a customer when she is getting irate demanding to known why you don't celebrate Thanksgiving. Especially when the only answer you can legitimately give is ""why would I?""

So I 100% believe this post is legitimate.

They did, they lowered the income tax rate for the top earners, which includes the elite as unsurprisingly they are the top top earners.

&gt;I have proved that's completely bollocks,

No you haven't. They lowered the tax rate while cutting benefits, one simple example of many changes they made which benefited their mates.

&gt;so your conspiracy world is already looking pretty shaky isn't it?

No it isn't, because instead of answer the conspiracy I present, you decided to make another point. Come on, tear apart my argument:

&gt;Tory biggest donors are in Economic elite (proportionally far more of the economic elite vote and fund Tories than Labour, Labour needing its funding from Unions). In order to get this funding, the Tories must be doing something right.
One of their policies was lowering the tax rate for the rich. Another is introducing a much harsher and more extreme version of Labours benefit.

Explain to me how the elite donating money to the Tories has no link the Tory policies just so happening to benefit their donors at the expense of people who don't vote Tory?

&gt;I don't know why I'm replying. I guess I'm still expecting an apology for your wrongness.

Your conspiracy (or one of your conspiracies) is that the tories lowered the top tax rate because they want to line the pockets of the elite. This is because the tories only want to do anything if it helps the elite. 

But I have already explained that the previous Labour government on average set a lower top tax rate than the current coalition. Does this mean the labour party is actually more in favour of the elite? Apparently not in your conspiracy world. 

Thus, fundamentally, your conspiracy is wrong. 100% nonsense. Complete and utter bullshit.

Scotland's population is 5.3m[1], the UK's population is 64.1m[1]. Scotland's proportion of the United Kingdom is 8.2%.

Scotland has 59 MPs[2], the UK has 650 MPs[3]. Giving Scotland 9% of total MPs.

I know it it plays well to the narrative that Scotland has disproportionate voting power, but it simply isn't the case.

I can only really see that tactic working if you have a death squad of custom grown world beaters.  Which if you have had two undefeated seasons in a row it's likely you may have such a squad. 


It obviously works for you but think about how vulnerable you are on the counter attack.  Everyone is pushed up into the final third the dlp moves forward to get a pass and your bwm goes out to tackle the guy who intercepted the ball on its way back to the dlp outlet.  That leaves your two cb completely exposed with no support.

I used to play with a holding midfielder when we much weaker earlier on. In place of the AP, and my alternate formation is now 3 at the back with 2 wing backs. 

I switched to a more aggressive main formation pictured there, when I feel like we can just overwhelm the opposition, which we do 90% of the time. 

I definitely have assembled a death squad and definitely wouldn't be as gung-ho if we still were relatively weak. I went through a brief period of playing a false 9 with a shadow striker, but the 2 of them seemed to get in each others way and occupy the same areas. Currently I let my AP run wild with free roam, and he usually pops into the box at the right times anyway because of his anticipation and off the ball. 

I have no idea if I'm actually correct, but I look for players with high work-rates and teamwork in this formation so they're a little more selfless.

The ""duck"" thing is real though. Ooo, and you must go to Langtry's or the Bell Inn and see the fishmonger (forget his name). The bloke is an institution. Sells prawns, cockles etc to the late night revellers at various establishments.

Oh, and avoid Yates's like the plague. Then again, I'm old and not English; so what do I know?

Other things you may wish to consider (depending on what you are in to): Notts LUG (small, but perfectly formed), Nottinghack (if you like tinerking/making/breaking), Chimera in Beeston (RPG etc). Roller Derby. Biking (the push kind), Sherwood Pines is nice. Biking (the motor kind), some good rides around. Hiking, peak district isn't far. Gamecity as well. Sure the uni has loads of stuff going on too.

We could more than double the current installed wind capacity and not run into problems with Britain being over-supplied with electricity.

The problem we have at the moment is that grid connections to remote areas with lots of wind farms may not be strong enough to collect the wind energy, and rely on local demand to absorb the wind power. If there is no local demand, it may not be possible to transport the power to another part of the country.

This is one of the reasons why the UK side of the interconnector is in England, and not at the closest location of Aberdeen. The Scottish grid is weak and already overloaded by wind energy. Better to connect to England where the grid is strong and has spare capacity.

The grid problem is a big one. Planning for new power lines has gone crazy recently. National grid have already announced 2 under-sea DC interconnectors between Scotland and England, because they cannot get planning permission for upgrading existing pylons. Even the new Hinkley point power station is having trouble getting power lines connected - for example, people have tried to block the main power line connecting the plant to the grid because it passes close to a field used by travellers, and they are concerned that the sight of the power line will cause bad behaviour in the traveller children because it will reduce their opportunity to play in the field.",null,0,null,1427497563,null,0,false,0,cpt1hw9,null,t3_30hdxd,null,t1_cpt1hw9,null,t1_cpsh6oo,null,null,null,1432053688,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

&gt;___The League of Gentlemen___ is a quartet of [British dark comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_dark_comedy) writer–performers, formed in 1995 by [Jeremy Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Dyson), [Mark Gatiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss), [Steve Pemberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pemberton) and [Reece Shearsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_Shearsmith). The [television programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_programme) for which they are best known, although officially labelled a [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom), was initially more [sketch-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_show), linked together by their common setting: the fictional [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village) of [Royston Vasey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royston_Vasey), based on the town of [Alston, Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alston,_Cumbria) and set somewhere in the north of England.  The show contains elements of [horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film). The first series aired on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) in 1999 and follows the lives of dozens of the town's bizarre [inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_League_of_Gentlemen), played by Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith in a number of guises and make-up. The television series was filmed mainly in [Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadfield,_Derbyshire) but also features [Glossop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossop), [Gamesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamesley), [Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden,_West_Yorkshire), [Mottram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottram), [Hope Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Valley,_Derbyshire) (Derbyshire) and [Todmorden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todmorden).

If you look at the data for the 2010 election you'll see they both get almost the same average amount of votes nationwide per seat they win. 

The conservatives won 307 seats with 10,726,614 (36.1%) total votes, which is an average of 34,940 votes per seat won.

Labour won 258 seats with 8,609,527 (29.0%) total votes, which is an average of 33,370 votes per seat won. Sure Labours average is slightly less, but this isn't a significant difference. 

Now compare that to the Lib Dems. They only won 57 seats with 6,836,824 (23.0%) total votes, which is an average of 119,944 votes per seat won. That's over three times higher than both the Conservatives and Labour. 

It's gets worse with many of the smaller parties too. UKIP got nearly a million votes yet didn't manage to win a single seat in 2010. 

Now if it was a ""a fair election"" (I'll assume by that you mean a proportional system, after all there would be no need for any of the dreaded boundaries that can favour one party over another), then the results would have been quite different. 

The conservatives would have won less seats, with 235. Labour would also have won less seats, with 189. However the difference between the two becomes smaller.

Now the Lib Dems would have got a staggering 150 seats. Here is the important part, with that many seats they could have formed a majority coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. Given that the incumbent government gets the first chance of forming a majority coalition, that means we could well have had a Labour and Lib Dem coalition for the last 5 years.

This means around this time Leeds city council may put on a fireworks display around that time of year. Except fireworks going off from late October to mid-November.

Christmas I would say is the same. Festive jumpers, mince pies (there's no meat in them), advent calendars, drinking too much, eating too much, crackers, ect. Something which might be done is the Christmas Eve/time pub crawl/drinking sess with friends. Oh don't expect/hope for a white Christmas either. Firstly if it does snow everything annoyingly grinds to a halt; secondly I have heard the UK's climate means that snow is more likely in January/February time. Oh also Christmas and Boxing day are [Bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays#england-and-wales).

New Year is the same in as in the States more or less.

As for Thanksgiving, while in the UK we don't celebrate the American/Canadian one. Nor do we celebrate it in the same way. We sorta do have one, the [Harvest Festival](http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/harvest.html)(sorry for the source it's the best I could find). It's more a religious thing, so if you are a Church goer you may have a Harvest Thanksgiving at your Church. There may be also some small rural community event, like the [Harvest Homes](http://www.wedmorehh.com/) in Somerset. Other than that it's not a big thing in the majority of people's lives, so it is often forgotten.

Edit. One thing I forgot! If you want to celebrate ""Good Riddance Day"" (I jest) might I suggest going to [Washington Old Hall](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/washington-old-hall/?p=1356316009471).

Yeah, ultimately if some people are offended, why should anyone else care? Why shouldn't people call gay men 'faggots' or impersonate black women in a way that clearly is insulting? Why can't a person go on some diatribe about how they are entitled to use the word 'retard' even though it offends disabled people?

I've started it with a 29% charge, 24 minutes into a 10GB 1080p MKV of Man Of Steel, being played in the latest version of XBMC. Volume is at 50%, brightness is 80%, wifi is connected but idle, and the file's being played direct from its mSATA SSD. There's nothing running in the background. Playback is smooth with no frames being dropped. Draw from the wall is a steady 9w. I'll leave it for another ten or so minutes and take a note of the battery level at that time to roughly work out what the power use while playing back a movie is. 

It's difficult to work out what it uses during idle times, particularly as it runs off a battery, although one thing that definitely goes against it is that there's no way to run the system 'headless', like you can with your Xeon. With this, there's no way to switch off the screen without also suspending the device. Maybe the only way to figure its idler consumption out is to discharge it to maybe 10% and then charge it up to 90% once off, and then again while it's switched on. The 9w drawn at the charger seems to be a constant, so maybe that can be used to calculate energy use. 

(excuse my rambling, btw - I'm at least half drunk, and half trying to kill time to see what Superman does to the battery)


Edit: And, yep, after 30 minutes of playback, which is about the most demanding thing you'd expect a tablet like this to do, battery charge has gone from 29% up to 36%, while drawing 9w from the wall. I'd guess it maybe draws no more than 6 or 7w all-in for HD movie playback, which is pretty impressive, considering that the old P4s would draw up to 40x that amount, and not be even half-way powerful enough to play that sort of res or bitrate.

But this game was more than just a rival match, it was a key match for who gets into top 4. It's never been like that b/t Liverpool/United, we rarely have matches w/ them that have such importance in regards to our aspirations in the table. He cost us big with that stamp, it hurt. I loved his tackle on Mata before the stamp, absolutely loved it, got everybody off their seats. But that's what he should be doing, going in for those 50/50s strong, which in rare cases end in a red. 

The stamp was needless, it wasn't tough or strong, anybody can stand on a person's leg when they're lying on the floor. It's petulance at that point. Keep a head on you, which is why I enjoy the Suarez and Costa type players.

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;This pretty much shows you don't understand the difference between ""saying/doing something that someone else disagrees with"" and ""saying/doing something inflammatory"" - something that's obviously going to cause offence.

But, I don't care if it causes offense.  It's irrelevant.  People can be offended by *anything*!  And people *are* offended by anything these days.  

&gt;Impersonating black women in a way black women find offensive is obviously inflammatory, and comparing this to social and technological progress is completely meritless.

OK where did I compare the two?  Sure you're not trying to go for cheap shots in order to beat me in a meaningless debate?  Yeah, I guess if you say anything self-righteously enough some redditors will fall for it, but self-righteousness doesn't make it true.

&gt;Impersonating black women in a way black women find offensive is obviously inflammatory

So what? Let black women be inflamed.  Unless you or someone else can provide an actual *reason* why it's unethical, I couldn't give a toss.  I'm not denying that in some cases it might well be unethical, but just claiming offense is not enough.  

Again and again - people can be offended by anything.  If we let offense rule our decisions then we will lose our ability to say anything.  We'll also find that professional offense-takers will come crying knowing that it's an effective tactic to shut down debate.

&gt;Calling a gay man a faggot or making sexist jokes brings nothing to the table.

But I will defend both.   First off - I absolutely disagree that sexist jokes never have a benefit.  For one - they can be funny and thus bring joy.  For another - they can allow us to broach taboo topics, under the guise of humor.  (They can even be used to illustrate sexism!  Just imagine all those sitcoms where a person telling a bigoted joke is revealed as a fool.)  

As for calling a gay man a faggot.  I will *absolutely* defend the -right- of people to do that.  Why?  Because the free-speech which allows  us to use the term 'faggot' is the same free-speech which has allowed the homosexual civil rights struggle to succeed.  

Would I defend it morally?  No, I don't think so.  But that's because I believe there are actual reasons which can show it's unethical.  It's not just because it's considered 'offensive'.

&gt;__Jeremy Bentham__ (/ˈbɛnθəm/; 15 February [[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates) 4 February] 1748 – 6 June 1832) was a British [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher), [jurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist), and [social reformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reformer). He is regarded as the founder of modern [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism).

&gt;Bentham became a leading theorist in Anglo-American [philosophy of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_law), and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of [welfarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfarism). He advocated [individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_freedom) and [economic freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_freedom), the [separation of church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state), [freedom of expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression), equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts.  He called for the [abolition of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism), the abolition of the [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty), and the abolition of [physical punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_punishment), including that of children.  He has also become known in recent years as an early advocate of [animal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights).  Though strongly in favour of the extension of [individual legal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_rights), he opposed the idea of [natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) and [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights), calling them ""nonsense upon stilts"". 

&gt;Bentham's students included his secretary and collaborator [James Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill), the latter's son, [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill), the legal philosopher [John Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosopher\)), as well as [Robert Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen), one of the founders of [utopian socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism). Bentham has been described as the ""spiritual founder"" of [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London), though he played little direct part in its foundation.

It appears we're just going to have to agree to disagree about this because for me it is absolutely *not* ethical to disregard other's feelings on the grounds that ""People can be offended by anything! Why should I care?"". I've seen how destructive people's remarks can be on someone first hand, even as those remarks are essentially passed off as 'free speech.' Free-speech is good in principle, but when there are people in this world who can say terribly damaging things with the excuse of 'free speech', it's nowhere near as good as people make it out to be. 

If enough black women have come forward and aired the fact they are offended by these remarks, we should stop and listen. Why should they have to present a peer-reviewed psychiatric paper on the effects of gay men making a mockery of black women in order to be listened to? In a progressive, respectful society, them saying ""Please have some respect and stop"" should be enough to make people stop.

As I said in a previous comment, in a part you conveniently ignored, I may not agree with an all-out ban on this remark, but ultimately this ban was made in the aim of protecting people from offensive remarks, and letting everyone enjoy university better.

Where you want to live depends on which campus you're at.  If you're studying arts/humanities/social sciences etc. you'll be in the George square campus.  If you're doing sciences you'll likely be at Kings Buildings.  Medics, vets and other specialist schools are dotted around the city.

For George Square you probably want to look at getting accommodation in Newington, Bruntsfield or Marchmont.  Bruntsfield is slightly more up-market, and Newington and Marchmont are more studenty.  If you've got a decent budget for flats you can also try Newtown, which is a bit further away but is a bit more young professional.

If you're at Kings Buildings, look at Marchmont, Mayfield, Newington and Morningside.  Morningside is a more upmarket area, but there are affordable flats there.  

In general halls are good, but tend to be dominated by undergrads.  Gumtree is usually a good resource for finding flatshares, but make sure you see the flat and meet ALL the flatmates first (voice of experience....)

In general the bus links in town are excellent and regardless where you live you'll be able to get where you need to go.  

As for whether its worth the $35k, thats up to you.  The university will support you academically and socially, but like everything else you've got to focus on extracting every last bit of value you can.  In terms of prestige, a postgrad from Edinburgh should get your foot in the door to most places.

The university is excellent, and you could hardly find a better city to study in.  Make sure to be in town around August if possible.  The entire atmosphere of the place changes around the Festival.

&gt;If enough black women have come forward and aired the fact they are offended by these remarks, we should stop and listen.

Nope - I still wouldn't care.  I don't give a toss how many black women claim to be offended if they can't articulate an actual reason.  

&gt;I've seen how destructive people's remarks can be on someone first hand, even as those remarks are essentially passed off as 'free speech.'

I'm not *morally* justifying *any* remarks on the grounds of free-speech.  But I would defend the *freedom* to make all remarks, short of direct incitement to violence (and perhaps in-your-face continued harassment, but that's more because of the pattern of behavior, than the content of the speech). 

And if people are hurt by 'destructive' remarks - then fight back!  People say things all the time which upset or annoy me.  But I don't think that means I should be able to shut them up.  No, I use *my speech* to fight back and I certainly don't go running to the teacher like a little schoolboy.

&gt;As I said in a previous comment, in a part you conveniently ignored, I may not agree with an all-out ban on this remark, but ultimately this ban was made in the aim of protecting people from offensive remarks, and letting everyone enjoy university better. How is there something wrong with that?

Because being offended is not a reason for anything!  And it's certainly not a reason for a ban.  Good grief - many people find transexuals offensive!  Should we ban transexuals too?

In general though - I think it's useful to distinguish between purposefully wounding remarks, i.e. *insults* vs. remarks which people find offensive.  I think that calling a gay person a 'faggot' is wrong because it's used to wound the other person and using an insult which implies that homosexuality makes them flawed.  

However I *don't* in general think that it's morally wrong to say or do something which is not intended as an insult but which still causes other people offense. So, for instance - I don't see a moral problem with transexuals going into a room if others find their sight offensive.  Neither do I think it's wrong for women to dress in miniskirts no matter how many muslims might be offended.  

So, what about, wearing blackface, for example?  And suppose it's not done primarily to insult anyone but just because the person decides it's funny.  Well - I think that if you want to object to it, then in that case you should be able to give an actual *reason* why you think it's wrong and it's *not* good enough to just claim that it's offensive.  (To make sure - I'm not at all saying such a reason doesn't exist.)  And even then - there's no guarantee that the reason is good enough, and perhaps there will have to be a debate. And even if you think you've won the debate I *still* don't think you have a right to tell other people what to do.  The only thing you can do in an open society is to try to convince people that they're wrong.

OK, I'm *definitely* going to bed.

I have seen two comic books stores die in my time in Oxford and both were ridiculously unfriendly. You felt like you were walking in a bikini into a mosque. Also they had nothing you could just *pick up* as a random treat for yourself because things were either too expensive or no series' appealed. However they weren't well stocked enough to be reliable for specialised purchases either. They appealed to a small inner circle, but the shopper searching for something to read over lunch or in the bus was left hanging. 

Also, if you would like some advice: Oxford Brookes has a very active Japanese degree which is growing year by year. It is their fastest growing language course and the department has gone from strength to strength. Those guys are a very good market. Something like ""Japanese for Manga lovers"" would go down well with exasperated first years. You could even go so far as to find Duraimon in Japanese original which is very easy reading or the dual language manga that have been done (Kindaichi shonen springs to mind). I'm afraid if you focus on American comics in original wrappings, you won't get very far in my humble experience. If you need any info on the Japanese stuff, feel free to shoot me a PM. 

On the comic ""scene"" (and you likely know this already, but I cried a little whenever a comic shop closed, so I's rather give too much information. I would be really, really happy if you succeeded):

- Atomic Pizza in Cowley road. They have a great, American comic theme going on. A place to consider for advertisement. 

- Game's Keeper in Cowley Road. They sell table top RPGs and board games. They also sell some RPG specific comics and games that tie in with popular comics. 

- Thirsty Meeple in the town centre. Gaming caffe where most geeks hang out. 

Finally, in my experience Oxford reacts really well to late night shopping and things like screenings, lectures and social events. I know it is quite a different line, but have a look at Simply Pleasures. They are relatively new and are flourishing where literally one shop after the next have failed. They run events every Friday and try to become the centre for several communities related to their market. It's worked out really well for them. Parking in Oxford is terrible, so many professionals only come in for events but then stock up - ideally in time for dinner afterwards.

Earldoms, Viscounties and Baronies can use names, places or both. Earl Grey is a name, for example, as is Viscount Feilding. Baronies usually have both, like Baroness Willoughby de Eresby. 
 
&gt;Is there a map of the UK split into these divisions?

There's no map since most of the titles overlap each other. When the manorial system sidled to a halt, the association of titles with specific parcels of land began to disappear. The manorial system was based on Lordships of the Manor, which are a bundle of land with a title and a few rights attached. When the transition from the manorial system to the peerage we all know today happened, Lordships of the Manor were sidelined and today are worth as little as £1500.
 
&gt;the inherited ones aren't allowed in Lords anymore or something?

In 1999 Labour defiled the House of Lords by removing the right of hereditary peers to automatically sit in the House of Lords, and set about appointing Labour cronies to tip the balance on their favour. Naturally, the Conservatives have done exactly the same and now hereditary peers are outnumbered 92 to 695 by ex-politicians who were given life peerages.

&gt;What's the Commonwealth up to?

The Queen is still the fons honorum for the Commonwealth, so she does all the knighting, honouring and ennobling. Tony Abbot recently reinstated knighthoods in Australia, which already had a small baronetage and Nova Scotia has an extensive baronetage. 

&gt;Is the Scottish system completely different?

No, but Scotland has Lairds and feudal Earls and Barons that are actual property and as such can be bought, sold and inherited by anybody. As such, the Russians are buying them at an alarming pace.",null,0,null,1427515984,null,0,false,0,cpta7ty,null,t3_30imtb,null,t1_cpta7ty,null,t3_30imtb,null,null,null,1432057869,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,
Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,
qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,
quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum.
Nam castum esse decet pium poetam
ipsum, versiculos nihil necessest;

qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,
si sunt molliculi ac parum pudici
et quod pruriat incitare possunt,
non dico pueris, sed his pilosis
qui duros nequeunt movere lumbos.
Vos, quod milia multa basiorum
legistis, male me marem putatis?
Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo.

In English:

I will fuck you in the ass and face-fuck you
You cocksucker Aurelius and little bitch Furius
You who think that my poems
Have gone soft, that I have no shame. 
For it is true that the devoted poet should be erect
And chaste himself, but it is not 
Necessary for his poems, 
Which are truly witty and charming
When they're a little soft, and not too stiff,
But can still cause a little tingling--
I don't just mean in boys, but for hairy men
Who can't make their own loins stand upright!
You! You have read many thousands of my kisses
And doubt I'm fully a man?
I will fuck you in the ass and face-fuck you.

null,false,jjones217,num23,,null,"I know there are parallels, but there are some major holes in your plot:

- **LeBron was a Cleveland native.** 

He was raised in the area, grew up in Ohio, he built his family there. Sure he was also a fan of the bulls and loved watching the stars as a kid (Jordan, etc.), but who didn't? He was Cleveland through and through and they drafted him first pick. He started his NBA career there.

Bale, on the other hand, came from elsewhere. He's a Wales native and he got his professional career started in Southampton, not at Spurs. He may have come into his own at Spurs, but they aren't necessarily ""home"".

- **Transfer fees.**

As you know, the NBA has no transfer fees. A player either gets traded for another player (or cash, I suppose), or they can simply run out their contract and sell their services to the highest bidder.

Theoretically, the same could happen in football. If Bale really and truly wanted to return to Spurs, he'd just run off the rest of his Madrid contract and come back on a free. But he's on contract with Madrid until, I believe, the summer of 2019. So it seems a bit unlikely.

And if he's still playing at his peak, he's most likely going to continue renewing his contract as insurance for if he injures himself or has a massive drop in form. Players don't usually like to leave their futures in the balance, especially as they continue to get older - not that Bale is old, but even still.

- **Daniel Levy and the New Stadium**

Spurs could never afford Bale. Not now. Maybe in 2-3 years, coming off a CL year or two, maybe we can swing a $45-$50 million transfer fee.  But probably not. Why?

Because, a, Daniel Levy is a smart, stingy man who does not pay over the odds for players. Levy has only ever spent more than £15 million on a player 5 times:

- Lamela has yet to prove he was worth all £30 million
- Soldado simply didn't live up to the £26m he cost us
- Paulinho still has a lot to prove for his £17m
- Modric was about the only one who well and truly was worth breaking the transfer record for. He lived up to his £16.5m, especially because of the return we got for him when sold.
- Bent was alright, but for a club record £16.5 at the time, you could argue he didn't come through for the purchase amount. Though i suppose we sold him for just as much, so it was a wash.

Anyway, point is. Levy isn't going to break the bank for anyone. Especially not at £45-50m, and *especially* when we're due to be opening a new stadium around that time. Sure he'll want to fill the seats with the best team possible. But you don't save money to buy a new stadium and play it all straight financially just to blow your wad to bring home a player.

I love Bale as much as anyone else, but this is a pipe dream through and through.",null,0,null,1427524490,null,0,false,0,cptd3lq,null,t3_30fp0c,null,t1_cptd3lq,null,t3_30fp0c,null,null,null,1432059226,null,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

17 a day does sound quite a lot for only 2 people but I don't know what your electric/gas mix is. 

This is where you count backwards

A kWh is when 1000W is used for 1 hour, so:

Say your PC is averaging 300W, that'll be 1 unit in just over 3 hours.

An electric panel heater is normally 1000W so 1 hour = 1 unit

An electric shower is 7000W to 11000W, so will cost a unit in under 10 minutes.

If the electric water storage has been accidentally left on, this'll run a very large bill very quickly.

It will *always* be cheaper to run gas heating if you have it unless you have many unused rooms (and you can turn off valves anyway)

Certain (but not all) companies give you the option to pay the exact amount you use, down to the penny, each month. 


However, the majority of companies charge you a set monthly amount and send you a monthly/quarterly statement to show you how how much you've used vs how much you've paid, so you will always have either a credit or debit balance. That balance is then brought forward on to each consecutive statement.


If the statement carries forward a debt balance more often than not, the company will reassess the monthly payment you're required to pay. This is normally done annually but can be done every 6 months. 


Without knowing which way he pays for his account, it's impossible to say definitively, but I imagine all that's happened is his monthly payment for reassessed to include a debt that he's been accruing for the last 12 months.

If the banks did not crash the economy and we didn't give them all that money we wouldn't have a budget deficit, so I would say your comments are uninformed.

For example, they're so horrifically behind in the online shopping field purely because they dug their heels in until they figured out a way to make it profitable from day one. All that's given them is a sense of misplaced smug satisfaction that they didn't lose money on one small part of their business.

Additionally, when they try something new, they royally cock it up. Take for example the new loyalty scheme, ""Match &amp; More"". As I said, I work for them. However, as I only do small frequent shops of below £15, and a single monthly shop for essentials, I'm still yet to receive a voucher. So, to my mind, what's the point in the card? I could just as easily go to Sainsbury's and via their Brand Match scheme, get a voucher for the difference there and then, rather than having to save up and jump through multiple hoops.

However, on the other side of this, customers are coming in and averaging a voucher once every 2-3 shops. I've known many a person redeem a voucher, only to be presented with a new voucher in the very same shop.

Most importantly, they're trying to take on Aldi/Lidl. How are they doing that? By removing their entire ""Savers"" range (extremely fucking slowly) and reducing their core own-brand range in price. This would be fine, but with price reductions come size reductions. Yes, your biscuits might now be cheaper, but there's less of them. Additionally, it's not clear in many cases that the core own-brand range is supposed to be the cheapest. I honestly believe that they're losing customers by doing this.

Stating 'this is how you dress here and there are no exceptions' sets a standard the moment a kid turns up at school - one of the reasons you don't see non-uniform days at a lot of schools any more is because behaviour went out of the window when those uniform rules were gone.  I don't think it's any coincidence either that the main source in this article is a schoolgirl calling *during lesson time* in isolation - that's not the behaviour of one of the 'good' kids, not to mention the fact that it just so happened that 70 kids turned up wearing the badges on their blazers one day, and it makes me take the whole thing with a pinch of salt.

Everyone has already given great suggestions and it sounds like you know what you are doing, but here are my thoughts.

Clean and welcoming store - none of my pervious LCS have fitted the stereotype, but I have been to those that look (and smell) like 15 year old me's bedroom. 

Friendly, knowledgeable and approachable staff. 


Events - signings, maybe something like a reading group or meets up, theme days for big releases (both book and film - e.g. if you'd been open doing something for the AoU release). Stuff to pull in both regulars and new fans.


Advice based on stuff I've heard some other store owners:

No one makes money on floppies. It is all about merch and collected eds/graphic novels.

Lots of manga - waterstones stocks a huge amount for a book store which suggests there is a good market in Oxford.



Good luck and keep us updated!

Things tends to make more sense and sound more reasonable when expressed clearly using correct terms, that's hardly something Brand has invented - do you demand George Osborn deliver his budget speeches not only looking like a druged out zombie but talking with the vernacular of one also?   

The fact is Brands arguments are not invented by Brand either, he certainly doesn't claim them to be - however all the many people from educated academics to street protesting hippies that have said similar things have been snubbed for some reason or other, generally because they're 'not interesting enough for people to care about' now though there is someone that's media friendly everyone says 'omg how awful he's media friendly, we can't have someone that talks well, it's so unfair!'

I think we're in worse shape than people generally say. Off the top of my head, I think we could look at up to 6 signings. We won't get all of them in the summer, but I'd want to look at them over the summer and January.

Striker: Key. Sturridge just can't stay fit enough, so we need to look at his replacement as our number one. For that we need proven goals, but still young enough to keep the FSG way going. Lacazette, Vietto have been mentioned, but potentially Berahino, Icardi or Mitrovic from Anderlecht as well?

RB/RWB: We need another top class option in this position. At the moment we're playing wingers out of position in a 3-4-3 but when we move back to 4 at the back we're very light with only Manquillo and Flanno, who are both excellent IMO but very defensive first and young. Serge Aurier would be fantastic, or Daryl Janmaat.

CM: Two players. When we move back to 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, only having Allen and Henderson isn't enough. Pjanic and Kovacic would be unbelievable business, but I'd love Milner and one of the two if not.

LB: We only have Moreno, who is too young to be first choice though has played well, and Enrique, who isn't good enough and is injured too often. Layvin Kurzawa from Monaco is a good player, I've seen Caner Erkin being mentioned, but I'd still love Fabio Coentrao.

GK: Need a top class deputy/first choice keeper. Brad Guzan would be cheap, and a top keeper. Asmir Begovic as well.

Wing/Attacking Midfield: Son Heung-Min, Andriy Yarmolenko or in pigs might fly world, Antoine Griezmann. All can score goals from midfield, and offer direct running to stretch a game.

Ask that question to someone in dire need of a place to live.

Honestly I'd rather have one of the cramped one-bedrooms purely because I'm not an enormous pussy and I've lived in a cramped one-bedroom before. We have a problem when it comes to getting people onto the housing ladder. That means we either drastically increase production or we watch as people are forced either into renting (which in turn hinders the saving up required to get a deposit) or living with their parents (which in turn hinders personal freedom and personal space)

&gt;You also have to take into account that a lot of voters already have a home and see no reason to support building more

A lot of voters also aren't in school anymore. That doesn't mean they're against more schools.

&gt;What do they have to gain from their backyard being turned into a building site? Why would they support this?

Well for starters they likely own the land on their backyard, so if that's literally where the building will be then they can either gain money by selling that likely tiny plot of land or just, you know, refuse.

As for why they'd support this, gee, maybe they realise there's a problem in this country and in order to get through it maybe people shouldn't be a bunch of nimbys about that problem.

English ethnicity is a thing, but it's pretty arbitrary, and an awful lot of us white 'English' people wouldn't, strictly speaking, fall into the ethnic English category due to immigration in the last few hundred years.

The audience was terrible as well, obviously picked to be as non confrontational as possible. I actually preferred the [question programme on the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b055tx34/free-speech-series-4-1-im-ed-miliband-ask-me-anything) where Miliband was questioned by young voters, the audience didn't give him as much of an easy time as this one. 

Something else regarding interviews in general. Often journalists will phrase questions in a way to get a white or black responses (or where no answer is good). Especially when they're looking for yes or no answers. Then they get annoyed when politicians ""don't answer the question"" despite topics being more complicated &amp; not warranting such simple answers. You also have to bear in mind sometimes they don't have answers or if they do it's not what you want to hear. But they know if they say these things no one will vote for them. Sure we'd love an honest politician but we almost never see them because people don't vote for them.

With regards to the idea of promises from politicians. Two things I will say on that, firstly you cannot expect a party to keep their promises if they do not hold a majority in parliament. You need a majority in the commons to pass legislation (actually more than a majority incase people within your party rebel). If we end up with a minority government don't be surprised if their policies get watered down significantly. Secondly, the world isn't a static environment, what seems correct at one point in time can be disastrous at another. Not everything is going to be implemented exactly as promised, changes sometimes have to be made &amp; ideas scrapped entirely if need be. For me, when I look at a party manifesto I don't think ""this is what the party is promising to do"" I look at it as what they'd *like* to do in ideal circumstances. It gives me an idea of their views on certain issues &amp; what is important to those in charge.

Also just an issue with this whole idea of debates. It is framing our election to be a presidential race when that isn't what it is at all. The system is designed around voting for your MP, he or she is the person that is suppose to represent your views in parliament. If we're voting for an individual we shouldn't have this stupid FPTP system &amp; bring in a PR voting platform instead. But that makes me wonder, how many people even know who their MP is? Perhaps we're kidding ourselves if we think the voters look at anything other than the main party manifestos.

I know what he means, Bonds mother was Swiss arisotracy and his father was Scottish arisitocracy.

That's not to say that Idris Elba wouldn't make a good Mi5 agent travelling around the world killing foreigners and shagging their women, but that person wouldn't be the same Bond that Ian Fleming wrote about in Dr No.

There's quite a good argument that Bond is a European white males reaction to the loss of the European world dominance after WW2, it's a fantasy of being able to go around the world and shag foreign women and kill their evil foreign blokes because they can't go around the world collecting bits of land for their empires anymore.
