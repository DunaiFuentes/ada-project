No, I don't. I understand that many would go if they could, but they can't. It simply isn't the kind of education the state can provide equally to millions of kids. Indeed, the low number of students is part of what makes private schools so successful.

However, private education is not the business of the state by definition. As far as the state is concerned, you either take the offer of free education or you don't. If you go to a private school the state does not give a shit because that's got nothing to do with them. That's *your* choice. If private schools are too expensive for you, the state can't do anything about that.

On the other hand, you can't take the option away from people who *can* afford it.

In the same way, you can buy a big house if you can afford it. If you can't, that's not anyone else's problem. And the state can't provide big houses to everyone for free.

Transformative fandom my bollocks, the only time this subreddit seems to discuss anything related to the show at all, it's negative talk like this.
  
So, I'll throw my opinion in here. 
No, I don't hate Clara, I love Clara. She's my favourite companion of the new series, and the criticisms that OP raised are fundamentally flawed.
  
The idea that the Doctor didn't like her for her, but for some magic reason, is a gross misunderstanding of the Series 7 arc. The whole point of that arc was that the Doctor presumed she was special, that she WAS something. But she wasn't, she was normal, and the Doctor was wrong about the Impossible Girl thing. This was clever, original writing, and gave us a fresh take on the companion.

After this point, Clara was given the chance to grow. She's had no more overexposure than loads of companions through the show's history but this ""Clara Who"" crap got hold somehow.
People joke about how the show should have been called ""Ian"" in the first place, and Rose had a much larger impact on the narrative than Clara has had.
  
When Moffat made the show more about the Doctor, people complained on this sub, when Moffat made it less about the Doctor, people complained on this sub. When Moffat made it that Clara seemed like a puzzle, people complained on this sub, and when Moffat rooted Clara in reality, people complained on this sub.

You caught me out by imagining something? That's not how it works I'm afraid. And that's still mob rule, avoiding a politically accurate move because of how the public would react. I'm sure during the Civil Rights movement in America plenty of decisions were avoided because of how the racist mob would react right? It's the same for the sectarians.



&gt; Says the guy who just made a comparison with the Nazi's on the internet. 


It was a comparison of the validity of an official emblem. The Nazis were an example use to prove a point; I made no comparisons to them. 


&gt; It doesn't matter what 'they' recognise, the fact is we all live in the UK and as such the state flag is the union flag. Further nationalists accept this as per GFA.


How on earth are you still not getting this? A Mexican is not British if he's living here and working here just because he pays taxes to the Queen. Therefore just because I do the same doesn't make me British either. Now the argument we all live in the UK, Mexicans don't apply- their not of this land. The 'official' decisions shouldn't be impacted by their specific needs. However, Irish people *are of this land*. People born here, and have their nationality spawning from that, have the right to be Irish and are absolutely vital they are considered for. Flying the flag of this country is different here seeing as how so much of its natural inhabitants aren't subscribed to what the flag represents! No flag, or at the best a limited UF is so much more tolerant as it considers how it doesn't favor one local group, and is equal to all.


&gt; That's a cultural region not a country. You can witter on about geography all you want, fact is our correct official term is Northern Ireland and calling it anything else which you literally stated were for political reasons is politically charged and not neutral.



Here you go again, inventing criteria to suit your ideals. Why does cultural region make calling it the South any less politically charged? The official name is 'The United States of America"" right? I'm calling the geographical North part of the country as the North part of the country which is 100% factually correct. Political charge is a political bias, therefore calling it 'the occupied six counties' would be politically charged, referring it to the North is not. The fact that you're insisting it can only be called 'Northern Ireland' is evidence of the offensive nature that you are showering open me.


&gt; So designated days in your opinion is a response to mindless bigotry - mob rule as you described earlier. I'm not sure how you claim that isn't being offended.


Designated days is a hell of a lot better than year-round flag waving. I'm not offended by this, I'm happy with the stepforward and will continue subscribing to the belief it should be taken down entirely. 


&gt; Even though it's already been stated by a neutral source that flying the flag 365 does not 'alienate' half the city


What neutral source? 



The motion Sinn Fein proposed was to take the flag down? What more do you need explaining?



&gt; Have you been to London? Union flag on official buildings everywhere.
&gt;Have you been to Dublin? Tricolour on official buildings everywhere.
&gt;Cardiff, Ednburgh, etc, etc


Well they don't fly it every single day, hence my quote of your man that phoned into Nolan. But aren't they different? This whole issue is about considering the extremely large Irish population in Belfast, do those cities have those same considerations to make?


I can't find a quote granted, this will have to do; 


Definition of passport; an official document issued by a government, certifying the holder's identity and citizenship and entitling them to travel under its protection to and from foreign countries. 

Every UN country uses a passport as a valid certification of someone's citizenship. It doesn't take a genius to work out that this means you can't just get any passport you want, you have to be of that country.

~~I refuse to believe the world wide financial crash, primarily concerning collateralized debt obligations, can be attributed to the spending of the labour party in government at the time. If anything, Thatcher 'fucked up the economy' by deregulating those financial markets.~~

&gt;Given that the conservatives are currently doing pretty much what Labour said they were going to do,

~~Not really. Labour's stance on European membership and their commitment to wealth distribution through increased taxes for example.~~

&gt;I don't agree they were fearmongering. 
 
~~You believe Labour would 'fuck up the economy again'? That's an idea perpetuated by Conservative allies in the media. They made the idea of voting Labour for their economic policies ludicrous, and so people concerned for the economy were fearful of voting for them.~~


&gt;So many people seem to be surprised at the behaviour of the current government, but they're behaving exactly how you'd expect them to. I think its pretty clear that the Tories did a good job of presenting themselves in a way during the election thats different from how they actually are.

~~This is completely true, the Conservatives made no attempt to hide their intentions of increasing the breath of austerity, as Osborne was reelected he stated that this was a green light from the British people to continue austerity.

null,false,SeyStone,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;You need to say why it is a concern to families and to future children.

The basis on which families can naturally be built is through the union of a man and woman. This is obviously not possible for gay couples. Traditional marriage allows a bedrock for a family to be built on, a bedrock that allows the children born from that couple to have a good upbringing. This good upbringing in many straight parent families can be put in danger through the undermining of the institution of marriage, such as in gay marriage. 

I'm not saying that gay people can't be good parents and I think they have every right to be if there are adoptions available to them. But I don't think that widening the parameters for who to get married benefits the institution or families very much, I believe it actually does damage to it.

With there being many family problems in the UK today (teenage pregnancies, single mothers, messy divorces, etc) I think we need to keep marriage as sacred for our society. And keeping it sacred means not handing it out lightly.

What kind of numbers are you getting? I set up a facebook account (not page or event) last year to organise everyone and get an idea of who would attend. You're more than welcome to use it if you like although most of the organisation was just done on steam chat. 

I absolutely adore Cherry Reds, it's one of my favourite places to drink/eat in Birmingham but I'm just not sure there would be enough space. We had about 20 people last year, which doesn't sound like a lot but it's enough for an atmosphere and there will surely be more this year.

Someone somewhere mentioned the Electric Cinema. That's an *amazing* idea and I think we should all pool our attendees and efforts together there. As it's a cinema the screen and sound will be on point and the Electric does a waiters service where they bring booze and snacks to your seats. And it has sofas. And is right by the train station. 

Someone also mentioned the Vic or the Church. Again, I don't think the Church is big enough or could accommodate (unless they have a secret function room I've never heard of) I can't even recall seeing TVs in there, although it does have my favourite rum and does awesome food. The Vic is very viable however. 

If all these fall through I could host it at my current work place, The Rectory. It has a function room set up for conferences so it has a projector clearly viable to the whole room. There's plenty of space and we wouldn't have people in charge of making the event run smoothly who didn't care about DOTA (IE if it was hosted at the Vic or Electric Cinema.) The down side is that I would still have to put down a 200 pound deposit that I wouldn't get back if we didn't spend a certain amount at the bar and I'm not really in a financial situation that allows me to take that gamble. 

Anyway, I think we need an idea of numbers. And me plus Gooky plus at least 4 others will definitely be attending a pubstomp somewhere. ",null,0,null,1436226495,null,0,false,0,csue9gi,null,t3_3bocg8,null,t1_csue9gi,null,t1_csonjcj,null,null,null,1437643474,null,1,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,1,null

Conversely, to take the current system to it extreme, would be to permanently entrench the rich and poor with very little room for mobility upwards. If the rich can pay for the better opportunities, better teaching, better care, etc, and have the ability to pass this wealth on generationally, then eventually, we have a problem. We have perhaps not existed as a capitalistic society long enough for this to become a huge problem, but it is inevitable that it will provided nothing throws a spanner into the works.

The poor will not be able to afford the opportunities of the rich, and thus themselves and their offspring will be permanently poor.

&gt;Deep down, people want to be better, richer, more intelligent and more successful than their peers and that is what pushes humanity forward

Indeed, somewhat. I doubt this desire burns in each of us as much as you may think, but assuming it did, the ability to realise said desire is entirely dependant on the opportunities available to do so. If at every turn, you are ultimately out-competed by someone of privilege, then one may soon give up on this goal. Furthermore outside of education and research, very few industries are truly meritocratic even before we consider costs an issue. The 'who you know' mantra which emphases connection over capability.

For example certain industries require extensive self-funding and training to enter, especially the professions. Those which cannot afford to do those things are ultimately priced out. This is even true of standing to be an MP, for example. While often scholarships, sponsorships, etc, exist, is this form of charity really the means in which we wish to progress everyone 'fairly'?

Equality of opportunity is definitely something worth aiming for. But merely giving people a chance may not be enough, if in order to realistically be considered, one has had to undergo expensive past events.

In a microcosm, we can (almost) look at South East Housing as an example. It is generally not possible for someone without generational wealth and without a partner, to afford to buy a property there. One may argue that instead training up for a better job therefore being better paid is the answer, but ultimately it cannot be. As only so many of these jobs are available.

&gt;Your solution brings down everyone's level. I'd rather we have a hierarchy, with aspiration and inspiration to reach the top; instead of everyone being brought down to the same shitty level of local comprehensives.

Banning private schools is likely not the answer, I agree, especially as the income levels they serve are a minority. But the question does deserve investigation due to the inherent unfairness in the existence of them and things like them. It is one thing having the drive and intelligence for a certain position.

Calligraphy has become the standard artistic way to spice things up. The most common way to write the Shahada (""There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God."") is in a rectangular form and if it's drawn it will be behind a monochrome colour. Usually Black, Green or White. It's on buildings, flags, books, armbands , shirts, jumpers, posters and etc all over the world. I used to have a door sticker of it and I really wanted bandanna of it. Lots of Catholics had crosses so I wanted something that was religious yet cool at the same time. Turns out I sweat a lot.

The problem at the moment with it is that  Al-Qaeda has appropriate it. Other groups try to be different by adding things like weapons or changing the style of calligraphy. ISIS have decided to use what is meant to be the seal of the prophet. Which is kind of why it looks amateurish.

Unlike the black one with rectangular shahada, I've never seen the ISIS style flag being used in a normal fashion. The government should definitely ban it and I would fully support them. With the black one I would hope they are a lot more deft and look for context.

Some ordinary family going about their business that have a car sticker with the black flag and the rectangular shadaha are probably not using it for any crazy reasons. However there are always assholes like Anjem and that crowd that do. The police should go after them and stop them. In a Muslim country people would know that Al-Qaeda is appropriating something older than them. However in the UK the majority of the time when people see it the black flag is when they see terrorists using it.

But don't forget that the NHS has been intimately involved with private companies since its formation.

Your GP surgery. The interface of the NHS. The way that the majority of people enter the NHS system. GP surgeries are mostly private, profit-making businesses. Most GPs make £100K+

Your dentist. A fair chance that they are private too, though less than the chance of your GP being private.

Pharmacies. Boots and Lloyds belong to multinational businesses who make billions every year. And independents again make a shitload of money and are run with the intent of making maximum profit.

And don't forget all the contractors etc.

Nobody is going to make you need private healthcare or insurance to use the NHS. But if there is discussion about private elements of the NHS (of which there are MANY), it's understandable that there should be representatives there to speak on their behalf.

Coursework marks were arbitrary because there was no solid definition of what constituted a high 2:1 or low 1st. You knew generally you were getting something between 65% and 74% and that for the most part there wasn't an awful lot you could do to influence the outcome, because markers were predisposed to award marks in that range. 

The marks were a lottery because you could only show up to half your allocated lab sessions and gain only a superficial understanding of the project and get a first, or spend 4 days a week in the lab and all weekend trawling through journal articles and get a 2:1. The mark was only partially a measure of the quality of the work, it was also a measure of how inclined your marker was to be generous. 

I'm not advocating a national standard. I actually think the 17pt scale would be suitable if there was a way to make it fair, but seemingly the only way of doing that is to just make 1 guy mark everything. If marking on a 17pt scale doesn't accurately reflect performance within a single department, I don't think a 13pt scale can be used to make useful comparisons between universities.

One of the times I went to a festival was Glasto in 1994 with people from work who had never been - one of them was my first 'trainee' IT bod, a fairly short (next to me), very slight british-indian kid who had bought all sorts of expensive parphenalia which I'd told him would get stolen if he brought it in (they actually nicked his entire tent, but that's another story).

Anyway we paid the security to bunk over the wall, which was very high (I'd say 10ft, but that could be my dodgy recall) - festival fences of that sort of size were still a new thing then, it was just before they stopped letting the travellers in the following year I think - so everyone had different ways of getting in, over or under.

In our case, we follow the security guard along this fence, all the while assuming that he's got a tunnel or has made a gap - and he suddenly turns, locks his hands and says ""right, leg up"" at my trainee.

My trainee, a newcomer to Glasto, looks up at the top of the wall and says ""What do I look like? Fucking Indiana Jones?"". He made it, though :-)

If you don't feel like you'd like old shows, start with Series 1, Episode 1, *Rose* of the 2005 revival and work forwards. Some people say the first series is a bit naff in places but I tend to disagree, I quite like it and feel the bad parts are vastly out weighed by the great parts.

Or start with Series 5, Episode 1, *The Eleventh Hour* of the 2005 revival. It's a soft refresh of the show and doesn't link back to the last few series that much. Carry forwards with that until you get to the end of Series 7, ir maybe half way, and then double back and watch the rest of the 2005 revival and some classic episodes. 

Or start with Series 8, Episode 1, *Deep Breath*. It's best to start with the beginning of a Doctor's run rather than in the middle, and while it might not be the *best* place to start watching it isn't a *terrible* place. I wouldn't recommend it though.

Or Season 1, Episode 1, *An Unearthly Child* from the original 1963 run. It's got a good start but loses it for me after episode two (the stories are divided into serials of episodes in the Classic era rather than the single episode single story format we have now). It's the very start of Doctor Who so it's always a possibility. 

Other starting points in Classic Who would be *Spearhead from Space*, *Robot*, I guess you *could* say *Castrovala* but I might not, and *Dragonfire*. I think for Six's run you might want to be more familiar with Doctor Who in general and be more accepting of its faults (since some of them aren't great) and most of Two's episodes are missing so there isn't really a viable starting point there. 

Well, there you go. Some people will say to start on *Blink* because it's hailed as the greatest episode ever (I don't but that's not the point) but I would say not to because it's not a good example of what Doctor Who usually is.

Never going to come close to Courtois and highly unlikely he develops into what Chelsea would expect from a backup. Is anyone crying about Blackman not getting a shot?

He doesn't have a work permit, obviously he has to get loaned out

&gt;list of Vitesse players

Out of all those guys, Bertrand Traore is the only one who has a good shot at turning into a first team player if he gets playing time IMO. I would find it disappointing if he doesn't get a chance to prove himself wearing a Chelsea jersey


The thing is, this isn't a Chelsea problem, it's a problem for every big team who has expectations to win the league every year and at minimum reach the CL quarters. Who's the last Barcelona academy player to become a first team regular? The last Bayern player? Real Madrid? 

Managers just don't have job security these days as evidenced by [Wenger having nearly as much tenure as the rest of the PL managers combined.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3bon86/as_of_this_exact_moment_arsene_wengers_tenure_at/) You combine this lack of job security with the budget to be able to able to bring in players who have already proven themselves in a top league elsewhere and it's easy to see how this happens. As a manager, there is a lot of risk that goes along with getting a young academy player more playing time, and even if your risk pans out it won't make your job any more secure.

Chelsea gets more flak for not incorporating youth players into their squad, but I think it's important to compare them to teams of similar stature on this subject. If you pick the five five best teams in the world (not including Chelsea) and compare the amount of academy players that have made it into their 1st team recently, is there really much of a difference?",null,0,null,1436231807,null,0,false,0,csuh761,null,t3_3cd6qf,null,t1_csuh761,null,t3_3cd6qf,null,null,null,1437645242,null,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12,null

Looking through his Wikipedia page he may have been arrested a couple of times, but possibly only in reference to deportation. Apparently he spent 9 months in prison in the 90s, but that may have been pre-trial.

He's in that odd status of having his money frozen, being unable to travel (he's on the UN's list of ""banned"" people), not having anywhere to go, and possibly subject to some kind of control order - and yet not being charged with a crime and thus put on trial. 

Outside terrorism, if someone is suspected of doing something criminally wrong they're supposed to be investigated, charged and tried (promptly) and punished. And once the punishment is over, they're mostly allowed to carry on with their lives as before (other than things like sex offenders' registers). But a lot of the terrorism laws have resulted in people being stuck in a kind of legal limbo - which is partly why they can be pretty controversial legally (such as when this legal limbo involved indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial).

They're people the Government doesn't know what to do with. They want to just get rid of them, but also want to keep an eye on them.

Retention of email and telephone contact data for this time is already required by the Data Retention Regulations 2014.

For internet browsing, emails I suggest using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [Enigmail](https://enigmail.net/home/index.php), for messaging I suggest [OTR, Pidgin is a good app to use on desktop OSs and Xabber on android.](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/index.php#downloads) If it is possible, get rid of your sim card, I know this can cause inconvenience but I've not had one for about a year and I've got by OK (I still have a phone running android minus google apps, I use fdroid app store and use my phone for reading [ebooks (tor link)](http://c3jemx2ube5v5zpg.onion/) and RSS feed content.

A note about Tor, while it isn't illegal to use Tor I recommend connecting using a bridge, to do this, while it is starting up press open settings, this window will be shown on first launch anyway &gt; press configure&gt; ""does isp block connections"" press yes then next &gt; choose transport type either obfs3 or obfs4&gt; next&gt; select no to local proxy questions&gt; connect. By connecting to a bridge your ISP can only see you connecting to a random IP rather than a listed tor node, they think your going to a random site or something.

Another essential, put the security settings to high so nobody can ID u via javascript. In browser press onion icon &gt; 'privacy and security settings' &gt; move the slider to high. 

There are some real jems on the tor network too like the ebooks link i put above

Serious question, I'm actually interested in your experiences and opinions. Someone bought me that book recently but I haven't got around to reading it yet. I agree that the working class are demonised to a large extent and I'm not stupid, I won't judge someone automatically for superficial reasons like the clothes they wear or the way they speak. However in my own life experience a large % them prove themselves to be dickheads within the first 30 minutes of knowing them.

Someone (on reddit) once said ""Of course they treat you badly if you think of and treat them like scum"" but he didn't get it. I only started thinking like that after they literally made years of my life (and families lives) a misery for no reason at all (we were raised to be polite an pleasant to everyone - we didn't give them a reason other than... not being them).

Here's my ""living near chavs"" experience (and what comes to mind whenever I hear ""chav""):

* Countless fights (Everywhere).
* Countless domestic violence incidents (Everywhere).
* Numerous attempted muggings (Bromley, Catford, Lewisham, Eltham)

And this wasn't just isolated incidents, this was a constant barrage of abuse and a disregard for the safety and sanity of others. Whenever something shitty happened that effected other people, always, always a chav. 

Sure, every type of person makes mistakes and has drama, but other types of people seem to keep it to themselves and not torment others with it. Notice I haven't mentioned anything like ""drugs"" or ""doesn't work for X years"" because various groups commonly display that behaviour and there are various reasons for it (circumstances, mental health, etc). The above is just outright violence for their own amusement and ""fun"" (which is why I regard them as ""scum""). Do other groups (goths, whatever) do the above sometimes? Yes, but nowhere to the extent or ""just for fun"" (in my opinion)

The kicker: In interviews they smirk and say ""they're not supported"", ""there are not enough jobs"" (they have no skills), ""no-one helps us learn skills"" (courses and support are everywhere, the internet is everywhere [and most appear to have internet]), ""there's nothing to do"". We lived in the same estates, went to the same schools, had the same education, had mostly the same opportunity (if you go towards bromley, you encounter the ""rich parent"" chavs which actually had *more* opportunity). Around my previous home in Downham within a mile radius there were at *least* 20+ football pitches alone, 10+ playgrounds, 4+ parks, woods, events, sports grounds. They all had bikes. Guess how many skateparks at the time? 0. We lobbied for years to actually get them built (you know, taking part in the local government process).

During the elections when Farage said something like ""what it means to be British"" I turned to the person next to me and said ""well"". Their answer was ""drinking, football, violence, cars, being a chav"". 

I completely agree with helping people, not judging people and the systems we have in place but to me, lots of these people are incredibly lazy and/or act like complete scum. Doesn't mean all. But to me, more than compared to other groups. Half the reason I'm leaving the country soon (born in London) is I'm tired of dealing with ""yo fam, bredder cum err"" idiots what feels like every day of my life.

It's 2:23am on a work day and I can hear mopeds going up and down and up and down for no reason... (sigh). Seriously, I'm not a snob or a ""classist"" at all, I just want (and so do many others who never dare speak up) a mostly peaceful life in the area they live (since you know, I kind of expect that living in a modern, first world country with all the opportunity it provides).

null,false,JB_UK,null,null,null,"&gt; When i have been to my GP for medical health she has never tried to get to the root of what may be causing it instead she has just thorwn medication at the problem so she can see as many patients as possible

Yeah, I know what you mean, I've had the same thing. It might be worth going back and being very straight-forward - just say, I think I am depressed, are there any services you could refer me to? To be fair to GP's, they often seem useless, but they will have seen hundreds or thousands of patients since you last went there. You can't expect them to work things out too much, you have to be up-front.

If that's no good, in my area there were counselling services that you can get access to without going through your GP. I'd have a look at the information leaflets at your GP surgery, you could find something there giving you a number to call. Or Google around in your local area for counselling services on the NHS. That might also give you information about services available in the area, to take to the GP, and ask to be referred to. It might also be worth calling up one of [these charities](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/mental-health-helplines.aspx) to ask advice.

If that's no good, it may seem a bit crazy, but these online courses for CBT are supposed to work: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/online-mental-health-services/Pages/introduction.aspx. You can get a course, for instance on insomnia, from say here: https://sleepstation.org.uk/ or https://www.sleepio.com/home/. Some of those are available on the NHS, depending on your local area, but you could also just buy a course privately for £60-100, which is at least much more affordable than private counselling. I personally found counselling not so useful as just knowing the techniques of CBT, and then applying them over time, although it obviously depends on the person.

I'm sure you can get your teeth sorted out as well, as other people say you can get really good deals going to Eastern Europe,  for veneers/implants/dentures, and some things on the NHS. No reason why that has to block the rest of your life.

A truly free market isn't desirable because the massive power held by corporations - if used without restraint - can harm the environment, people's health/liberty, exploit people's labour etc.

With private schools, the no-profit condition is good because it stops the incentive to alter pupils' education in order to make more money. In this way the government already *has* intervened.

However, to intervene in a way to stop private education is not unethical per se, but unjust (imo they're not the same thing); this is because of the reasons I've stated before: that there is no good reason to, and so on.

With other products such as fast food, there is regulation to make sure the food isn't too harmful, but you're still allowed to buy fast food.

**Edit:** I should probably clarify what I mean:

* An i7-5820K currently costs just over £300 on Amazon -- your older i7-3930K is listed as costing £449.98.
* The X79 chipset has since been replaced by X99.
* The two HDDs you've got listed are extremely overpriced. You can get two reliable 7200 RPM HDDs for &lt; £100 (yours are listed as costing £228.37).
* The Corsair Obsidian Series 800D case was discontinued a few years ago and I'm not sure why you'd have one for a single-GPU build? You could fit all of this comfortably into a much nicer-looking case for less than £100.
* A 1250 watt PSU for this build is bananas.
* The GTX 680 performs roughly the same as much newer GTX 960, which costs about £170 new (yours is listed as costing £309.95).

It's late, and I'm tired, so I'm not going to put too much thought into this, but it definitely wouldn't sell for £2,000 new, and £1,000 used is rather ambitious, given that there are some pretty serious mistakes made within this build. Considering how OP the CPU is for gaming, you could make something the performs much better for more or less the same asking price -- and that's *brand new hardware*.

Try aiming a little lower and maybe throw into a cheap monitor, keyboard, and mouse and you'll probably find a buyer on Gumtree! If you're willing to sell the CPU and motherboard on their own, and then sell the other components individually, you'll probably find buyers easier, but time is a concern since you've got to pay your rent so I'm not sure to recommend. Normally I wouldn't be a jerk and make a comment like this but a friend of mine recently overpaid significantly for a machine and I wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake as he did! :(

A firm could do many things to avoid hitting the tax limit. I'm not advocating a full 90% tax, just a 90% tax above a certain profit threshold. They could limit their growth (which would cause problems for investors, so is probably the least likely choice, but even so, it would help competitors and reduce barriers to entry). They could increase quality of life for their workers, through wages or health benefits, etc. They could expand and provide more employment. They could invest in their products, creating a higher quality or quantity for their consumers.

The logic behind a 90% top tax rate isn't to increase tax revenue. Its to encourage firms to reinvest in themselves, rather than funnel money to the top. It increases equity through enforcing a soft cap on income, rather than artificially encouraging equity artificially through welfare. Once they reach the threshold, they will stop creating profit, and instead be forced to either pay 90% of it in taxes, or reinvest it in their own firm.",null,0,null,1436235982,null,0,false,0,csujkbh,null,t3_3car9r,null,t1_csujkbh,null,t1_csuj32u,null,null,null,1437645736,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

However the first -team very strong and good enough to win the premier league. They will be the team to beat domestically.

In Europe &amp; FA cup, we were hurt by the lack of depth. We indeed have a lack of depth relying heavily on players like Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa. If anyone of these 4 gets injured we miss them badly. So we should be targeting backups for these positions. Remy has assimilated well in the squad and Hazard is well Hazard. So Jose needs to make a call on Fabregas/Matic backup. 

The obvious place we can upgrade is left back. Dave is world class defensively. If we can have a left-back who can attack better than him and somewhat match him defensively we will be in a better position.

null,false,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),null,"Indeed. Many welfare payments are very specific about hospital stays effecting payments to the point that generally, you must inform the relevant party about hospital stays so they can deduct accordingly.

It is, quite ludicrous but also from a purely logical standpoint, somewhat understandable. If you are not spending, due to hospitalisation, then there is no sense in the Government paying for you twice (NHS + Welfare). However this line of thinking completely ignores that some are reliant on these payments for travel to and from hospital and to realise regular outgoing payments (insurance, rent, etc) and can be quite ludicrously stupid for regular short (thus expensive) stays.

It is doubly insane when there is a realistic chance that someone is to come out of hospital in the near term. Thus removing their home, or mobility instruments, etc, ends up being a more costly endeavour for the Government as a reassessment occurs and all these things are re-awarded, at significant cost to undergo the entire process. Unfortunately the system is  short-termist when it comes to cost.

But in this case I think, perhaps unfortunately, that it might be correct. 12 weeks is a quite some time and visitation by family is not something as a society, we have decided to fund (although I would argue we should in instances where this is not otherwise affordable). A car is something they may be able to fund through the work of one parent as clearly it isn't being used for their child. GoS should be giving the child an adequate level of care thus the care needs of the mother are not required.

It is unfortunate, and I think 12 weeks may perhaps be a little too short. However realistically, there is no sense in paying for a carer when the hospital is providing that role. A more appropriate (and better paying than CA) alternative now is to seek JSA, with all the fun that entails.",null,0,null,1436237254,null,0,false,0,csuka4b,null,t3_3cdagx,null,t1_csuka4b,null,t3_3cdagx,null,null,null,1437646369,null,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

Jenkinson, almost certainly.

&gt;However, my sources have told me that a move for another summer target has unfortunately been delayed after the player picked up an injury and is expected to face a spell on the sidelines.

&gt;I believe that the Club will not consider making a move until the injury has cleared up.

Isn't Song being treated for an injury at Chadwell Heath right now?

&gt;There is better news surrounding further additions to the squad and I have been told that the Club expect to have the first of two or three major signings by the middle of the month.

I would assume this is Ogbonna, if ESPN is to be believed.

I was reading through the Bayern subreddit the other day and one of the things I saw a few people mention was how long it had been since any fresh blood from their academy had become first team players. 2 academy players from the last five years is ok, but there is definitely room for improvement there.

the two previous comments both mention that the 900,000 figure was a third of all those who might be committing benefit fraud, i.e 33%. Then I quoted the bottom of the article with the actual correct figure they updated it with.

&gt; Yes! Certainly one or other, possiby both. As do you when you make points like 

So we're going to ignore that Cameron has deliberately mislead the public to try and improve his image on deficit reduction, and that hes allowed tax avoidance to happen, but you still think he has everyones best interest at heart?

He also promised to reduce the 'bulk' of the deficit (implying the majority) within 5 years, which he has not, but we've been continually going off the original subject that i commented on.

From the evidence we've both posted, its clear that David Cameron hasnt always been upfront, my main point was that if he put half as much effort into tax avoidance as he has done with benefits we'd be a closer to the actual deficit reduction numbers he'd hope to have acheived, but there is evidence to suggest that isn't his main priority because he has a conflict of interest with regards to lobbyists donating to him with untaxed money, which appears as bribery.

Instead he continues his motion of frivolous cuts that effect innocent people, instead of the people who put us in this situation in the first place. Other cuts he has made have been idealogical too (such as cutting the gay police association budget but not the christian one).

My understanding was that most of their original concerns, like lack of competition upstream, vertical integration etc. turned out to be completely unfounded and there was just a small residual problem with customers who were too lazy to switch getting charged a lot. But arguably that wasnt a secret, that was their business model (low intro price to attract people then raise it) and it's one used in loads of industries. It did raise an interesting philosophical question, it seemed to me energy companies were being held to a much higher standard than any other when it came to their duty to effectively protect the customer from themselves.

To put ""1.5bn overcharging a year"" in context for people the big Six have about 46m customer accounts so that's roughly £33 a year per account. 

Lots of politicians will rant and rave about this report from the ballot box, claiming they were vindicated. But given that it started with a list of issues as long as your arm, including some pretty serious accuations of collusion and a threat to break these companies up just ending back at ""people who don't switch get screwed"" is a massive anti climax.

&gt;__Chelsea Football Club__ /ˈtʃɛlsiː/ are a professional [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) club based in [Fulham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham), [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), who play in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League), the highest level of English football. Founded in 1905, the club have spent most of their history in the top tier of English football. The club's home ground is the 41,837-seat [Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium\)) stadium, where they have played since their establishment. 

&gt;One of the most successful clubs in English football, Chelsea had their first major success in [1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954%E2%80%9355_Chelsea_F.C._season), when they won the league championship, and subsequently won various cup competitions between [1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964%E2%80%9365_Chelsea_F.C._season) and 1990. The club have enjoyed their greatest period of success in the past two decades, winning 17 major trophies since [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_Chelsea_F.C._season).  Domestically, Chelsea have won five [league titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions#Total_titles_won), seven [FA Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup), five [League Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup) and four [FA Community Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield), while in continental competitions they have won one [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League), two [UEFA Cup Winners' Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup), one [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League) and one [UEFA Super Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup). Chelsea are the only [London club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_London) to win the UEFA Champions League,  and one of [four clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_club_competition_records#List_of_teams_to_have_won_the_three_main_European_club_competitions), and the only British club, to have won all three main [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) club competitions.  

&gt;Chelsea's regular [kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_(association_football\)) colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. The club's crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s.  The club have sustained the fifth-highest average all-time attendance in [English football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England).  Their average home gate for the [2013–14 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_in_English_football) was 41,572, the seventh highest in the Premier League.  Since July 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire [Roman Abramovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich).  In May 2015 they were ranked by *[Forbes Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes)* as the [sixth most valuable football club in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs), at £898 million ($1.37 billion).

I was not a fan of her in series 7 but in series 8 they really revamped and fleshed out her character. The fact is, going through the things that the companions go through SHOULD change them. If you or I was experiencing these things then there is no way we could remain static. 

What they really did with Clara in series 8 was to set her up as competent but flawed and human in Deep Breath (especially her sequences with the half faced man), then explicity set up her initial role for the Doctor (as his teacher and moral compass in Into the Dalek), and then look at how her experiences changed her and that relationship over the course of the season. Seriously, it was probably the best companion character arc we've had. Look at everything leading up to the turning point in Kill the Moon; she is constantly trying to maintain her connection to Earth by latching onto Dann and she is fighting to maintain her role as the Doctor's ""carer."" Both are understandable reactions, but both start to take a toll. When she is forced into the sort of position the Doctor is usually in in Kill the Moon, it breaks her and she fights back. She really forces him to reexamine his idea of his role and who he is, setting him on the right path again but also being forced into this position allows her to finally understand his perspective. That primes her to be ready to both, ""get"" him better and then begin imitating his methods more at the end of Mummy on the Orient Express. Now look at Flatline, here all of the season so far has changed her on subtle and understandably human ways and now she is mimicking the Doctor explicitly, the good and the bad. By that point she is no longer the crying girl vs the monster, she is the one who will lie and cheat to save the day, she is an excellent Doctor but as he has been finding himself she is losing who she used to be and even he is taken aback at the change in her moral fortitude.

I could go on, but the point is that I love Clara because she is a dynamic and growing person who has wants, needs and desires under the surface. Her actions are not always pretty, but they are always consistent with her development and above all human. 

Also Coleman and Capaldi have great chemistry and her acting has seemed sharper with him around.

Contrast this with Amy who had her baby melt in her arms, lost the chance kids and was failed by the Doctor when it came to saving her child. But then immediately happily dealt with a story about family dynamics involving a child without even mentioning the trauma she had just undergone.

null,false,q_pop,null,null,null,"**Edit**: Although I'm extolling the virtues of pensions below, this shouldn't distract from the usual budgetary considerations. Person spoke about in OP's post should focus initially on building an emergency fund of ~3-6 months expenses (£2,100 - £3,500 based on the post) before doing longer-term investing. [See Wiki post for further details](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment).

First of all he should get a [state pension forecast](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-statement). His state retirement age will be 67, and so any further savings he makes should be made in line with that date.

The state pension will most likely provide ~£8,000 PA (though this can very from £5,500 - £12,000 depending on contribution record)

If his workplace offers a pension he absolutely must join it, and if they don't he should join it as soon as they do. The reason for this is that the pension is very easy to set up for the employee, and the employer makes some contributions (albeit they may be pretty low at first, this is free money he will be missing out on if he doesn't).

So, let's say he saves £300 per month from his take-home pay for the next 17 years in a pension. For the sake of simplicity let's ignore employer contributions.

£300 x 12 x 17 = £61,200. 

If he put this into an ISA earning 1.5% PA it'll be worth ~£70,000, although once inflation is taken into account (assuming 2.0% inflation) it'll be worth £58,000/

Now let's say he makes the same savings into a pension (any pension, private or company):

* £300 receives tax relief @ 20% = £375

* £375 * 12 * 17 = £76,500

* If the pension returns 5% PA after charges, it'll be worth £120,000.

* Accounting for inflation (2% PA) it'll be more like £100,000.

Because he will most likely have only the state pension in retirement, he will probably pay littler or no tax on any income from the £100,000.

The income might be:

* 25% taken tax free and put in a savings account to produce a bit of interest - £25,000 * 1.5% = £375 PA (this could be invested in stocks and shares for higher income)

* The remainder could buy a risk-free (taxable) income of  ~ 5% PA using an annuity - £75,000 &amp; 5.0% = £3,750 PA

This might mean:

* State pension: £8,000 (ish)
* Private pension: £3,750 (ish)
* Savings interest: £375 (ish)
* Overall: £12,125 (ish), probably nearly entirely tax free = £1,000 per month take-home (ish).

null,false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"So it's nuanced, isn't it. On one level I completely agree. I once, alongside a friend, got into an enormous argument with an incredibly privileged girl who told us that it was offensive to use the word chav (having read Owen Jones' book). Now, this girl had grown up in a life of luxury, went to a top public school, and had been completely insulated from the real world. My friend and I are both from state schools. Good state schools, but still having been exposed heavily to chavs. And yeah, we were pretty emphatic that we were going to use that word all we like to describe the complete and utter bellends. 

The problem comes from calling anyone who isn't middle class a chav. Which is something that absolutely happens. A 'chav' is someone who is not necessarily (just usually) from a poorer background, but someone who is aggressive, rude, disrespectful, a nuisance, etc etc. While it is normal for someone from my area to call a chav a chav, a lot of my friends from Surry will use chav as a derogatory word to describe anyone who does unskilled labour, wears tracksuit bottoms, and drinks at Wetherspoons. That is the kind of usage Owen Jones, being privileged as he is, is used to hearing and is attacking. 

But these people exist for a reason. No one is genetically disposed to be a complete twat. We as a society have created them, and we can't necessarily say that any of us would be different given the exact same upbringing and experiences. So although the word itself, when used to describe an antisocial and deeply unpleasant person, is more descriptive than pejorative, we still have to try and recognise that it isn't as easy as saying 'well they're a chav so they're scum'. We have to try to ask how we can fix our society to stop creating them. Chavs didn't exist until Thatcher thrust the working class into abject poverty, putting people on the dole and offering no opportunities for the generation used to working. That dejected unemployed generation then produced a whole generation of people used to not working, aware that they have no opportunities or hope, if nothing else because of the way that they speak. Blair's government didn't fix the problem with their misguided do-gooding, and Cameron is actively making it worse by thrusting these people deeper and deeper into poverty to benefit the upper middle class. 

I'm not using this post to propose a solution - far smarter people than me are stumped by the problem. But rather, to point out the two layers that exist to the word 'chav'. Basically our problem is the underclass, and how to help them out of poverty. Ultimately, someone becomes a chav because they have no discipline, no aspirations, no opportunities, and no purpose. Schools can only do so much when the parents are utterly uninterested in bettering their children.

&gt;

&gt;__Militant__, officially the __Revolutionary Socialist League__,  was a [Trotskyist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism) [entryist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entryism) group in the British [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)), based around the *Militant* newspaper launched in 1964. According to [Michael Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crick), its politics were influenced by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels), [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin), and [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky) and ""virtually nobody else"". 

&gt;In 1975, there was widespread press coverage of a Labour Party report into the entryist tactics of Militant.  Between 1975 and 1980, attempts by [Reg Underhill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Reginald_Underhill) and others in the leadership of the Labour Party to expel Militant were rejected by its [National Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee), which appointed a Militant member to the position of National Youth Organiser in 1976 after Militant had won control of the party's youth section, the [Labour Party Young Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_Young_Socialists). 

&gt;In 1982, after the Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's strategy to set an illegal deficit budget, a Labour Party commission found Militant in contravention of clause II, section 3 of the party's constitution which made political groups with their own ""Programme, Principles and Policy for separate and distinctive propaganda"" ineligible for affiliation.  Militant was proscribed by the Labour Party's [National Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee) in December 1982, and the following year five members of the Editorial Board of the *Militant* newspaper were expelled from the Labour Party. At this point, the group claimed to have 4,300 members.  Further expulsions of Militant activists followed. Militant policies dominated [Liverpool City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council) between 1983 and 1987 and the council organised mass opposition to government cuts to the rate support grant. 47 councillors were banned and [surcharged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surcharge_(sanction\)).   The conduct of the Liverpool council led [Neil Kinnock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Kinnock), Labour's then leader, to denounce Militant at the 1985 Party Conference. Eventually Militant's two remaining Labour [MPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom) were prevented from being Labour candidates at the [1992 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992).

Except that isn't the case at all - I've spent quite a bit of time looking at the Arms Trade Treaty which is just coming into force. 

The guns that are used in Tunisia to massacre people on the beach, the guns that are sweeping Syria, the guns that are in the hands of Boko Haram, they are all coming from Libya - ex-gaddaffi arms depots that are just unguarded in the desert. Local people get a truck, drive up, fill it up with boxes of grenades, ak47s or tank shells and go sell them to trades who smuggle them across MENA. Even Western countries that do export small arms and explosives - lethal arms, such as the US or Italy, they can't compete with the market prices of the weapons flowing out from these colossal arms dumps.  

Hence why when you see anti-arms trade statistics or infographics, the authors will always put the figure in money, rather than in number of guns. Because the UK selling wheel nuts or communications relays doesn't quite seem that bad, whereas $4,000,000 leave it ambiguous enough for people to implicitly make the assumption that it is guns. 

The notion of ""arms"" is very broad, it covers pretty much any military product. Hummer wheel nuts count as arms, radar systems count as arms, as does body armour. Look into what Britain actually sells in terms of arms, it isn't guns. It isn't the things that are massacring people every day, the things which are actually causing human suffering. It is radar systems, it is ultra complex missile defense systems, communications. Yes these help prop up regimes like Saudi Arabia, but only against other states. Radar systems are surprisingly expensive to run and not very effective at suppressing dissent. 

Personally I'd love to see us stop selling anything to Saudi Arabia, and rid of the world of all petro-states that aren't accountable to its citizens because it doesn't need their taxes due its oil revenues. But criticism isn't worthwhile unless its accurate, and we shouldn't pretend the UK is really selling states the stuff that causes every day suffering. 

Britain has a pretty effective licencing system at tracking British arms traders where each trade has to meet a set of criteria preventing it being used in these situations. Obviously some get through the net, but HMRC does its job very well and catches most of them.

Someone finds a small split in the fence, and beckons his immediate group to come and have a look through. One of them tests the strength to see if it would be an easy win. 

A few people see what's happening and hang around to see if they manage it, debating whether to follow them through if they're successful. 

Gee'd up by the audience, the original people double their efforts to try and get it. 

People see a group forming and join it to see what's going in, most of them with no criminal intent but are just keen to see *if* anything happens, and *maybe* they can sneak in. 

The crowd grows even stronger, probably helped by texts and social media posts ""Yo, shit! A whole gang of us are breaking down the walls to Wireless! Come join us! FREE CONCERT! #YOLO"" (Those posting would be simple observers, the cowards of the group but will take responsibility for single-handedly gaining access for the crowd when recounting this story to friends, although will cry when confronted by police.)

As the crowd grows, the participants feel even more protected by the veil of anonymity and the group of people at the front gains numbers and becomes more aggressive. The original group have probably removed themselves from the situation as others who are more assertive and forceful take control. 

A split in the fence appears, a few selfish people throw themselves through it with no thought for the friends they were with, probably elbowing them out of the way ""I'm alright, Jack!"". 

Suddenly... authority appears! 

99% of people scarper, nearly all of them observers and encouragers and nothing more. They retreat far enough so as to distance themselves from the people actually involved but will run with their heads turned back so they can still see what's going on. The final 1% feel they are invincible, as if they have an army at their backs, and confront authority. They do not. They are idiots. They quickly back down when they realise there might be actual consequences to their blustering. Some do not. 

Crowd disperses. A handful of people are detained.

null,false,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,null,"&gt; A car is something they may be able to fund through the work of one parent as clearly it isn't being used for their child. 

I'd argue that they should be able to use the car to visit him, as that would very much be using the vehicle for the benefit of the disabled person for whom it is provided.

&gt;GoS should be giving the child an adequate level of care thus the care needs of the mother are not required.

I'd argue that most 7 year old kids do need some care input from their parents during long hospital stays. Even if we are to discard any attempt at being humane, and look at this from a purely financial angle, as seems to be fashionable, the cost of the £60 odd per week Carer's Allowance provided to his mother would be well spent if it reduced the workload for the staff at the hospital, freeing them up to provide care to others who don't have a parent on hand.


But to be quite frank, I find this situation to be quite appalling. I don't pay my tax in the hope that it's spent on subsidising businesses who pay low wages via tax credits, nor for lining the pockets of grouse moor owners or buy-to-let landlords, I pay it in the hope it will be at least partly be used to lessen the burden on people who find themselves in situations like these folks.

Terrorism wouldn't suddenly stop if we decided to become completely isolationist. ISIS is an organisation who's primary goal is to kill Shia Muslims. They would still be doing that if we left the area. So how is what you suggest a ""solution"" to terrorism? 

The whole issue of selling arms to countries who ""abuse human rights"" is a non issue, because there are international sanctions which prevent the sale of weapons to such states. We aren't selling weapons to terrorists. What specifically are we selling and to who that you have a problem with? 

Yes it might seem distasteful to sell weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia, but the reason we do so is because like I said before, there is no perfect solution. Saudi Arabia is actively fighting ISIS. The ONLY solution to the problems of terrorist groups in the middle east is a group effort by ALL the countries affected to eradicate them, otherwise these groups will just move from one country to another.

I never said I was against Sunday openings, I only said in that in my experience retailers tend to treat their staff poorly in situations like this. If you'd like to know what I think I'm all for it but I think people who make up workforces like retail need protected in some way against being taken advantage of by employers and simply saying that if they don't like it then they should leave shows a lack of understanding of how the world actually works.

&gt;When I was in retail I taught myself transferable skills. People stop spoonfeeding me at 2 years old. Stop trying to bring people down to your level. 

So after every single person in retail teaches themselves transferable skills and gets a super job then who is going to be working in retail?

* Often the ""he takes the pension, she takes the home"" argument is a massive mistake for the divorcee. A common wheeze is for the solicitor to argue that the ""current value"" (obtained by a CETV if we're talking final salary pensions) of the pension is x, and so the house is a better deal. They basically completely ignore the future value of the pension (which is what matters).

* BTL is a complex, expensive, and potentially disastrous investment for somebody with little/no knowledge to go down. Let's say your mum retires with a single BTL property producing her income to live on. What happens when she has a void period (professional landlords tend to assume their properties will be empty at least 10% of the time).

* Not only that, but the yields are poor. You're talking London prices for houses. What rent will the £340k property attract? Then deduct 10% for voids and 10%-15% for agency fees, and another 10% for maintenance. Will 70% of the gross rent amount be sufficient?

* What about bad tenants? Is she emotionally/financially able to deal with people not paying the bills, stripping the home of all its metal pipes (I've seen this happen), knock holes in doors/walls etc.?

* If she works in education she may well be entitled to join the Teachers' Pension Scheme. This is a fantastic pension and she absolutely should join at the earliest opportunity if so.

* A far more sensible (and simpler, less potentially disastrous) plan would be for her to buy herself a property, hold a margin of comfort in cash (say £10,000-£20,000) and invest the rest in a long-term diversified portfolio of low-cost investments. 

* She could then use ISA allowances and annual pension contribution allowances to maximise the tax-deferred/tax-free element of her investments, resulting in a reliable income stream when she decides to retire.

* If she doesn't want the hassle of arranging this, she should seek professional advice from a (preferably chartered) independent financial adviser. www.unbiased.co.uk is a good place to find one.

As Fintan Dunne, editor of BreakForNews.com points out, 'these types of private-sector ""risk management"" drills never use field staff. 

&gt;Neither do [such] low-level corporate drills have active involvement of police or other security forces.' The exercise, therefore, was 'in no way comparable to U.S. drills and wargames on 9/11 - which were being run by active-duty security forces in the U.S. military, federal agencies, the FAA and various emergency services.'

&gt;As Power explained, the London bombing scenario was in fact one of three explored: another looked at the disruption that might be caused by unruly anti-globalisation demonstrators. In no case was there any real mobilisation of physical or human resources, which makes the case for 'planned' intelligence alibi look awfully flimsy, if not downright silly. 

&gt;In the light of a brief interview with Power, the 'unbelievable' coincidence of events suddenly seems entirely comprehensible: the train stations targeted, after all, were all in central London -- any planner would pick these amongst a list of possible targets.

I think we need another player in midfield. Getting rid of Mikel is fine but if we only bring one in then I'm not sure that's enough. Having Fabregas, Matic, Mikel and Ramires for the four deeper positions showed over the course of a season that it wasn't enough as we were knackered by the end. Maybe the other body will be Loftus-Cheek, but I'm still not convinced that Mourinho will play him regularly. He promised the same for Chalobah, for example.

I think we need a lot more depth in defence. We need a left back, a right back and a centre back in my opinion. The left and right backs need not be of top drawer quality, but definitely enough to come in and compete - not unlike how Azpilicueta first came into the squad actually. I think we need an outstanding centre back. I really fear if JT gets injured. Cahill and Zouma is a recipe for disaster. That centre back partnership conceded four against Bradford for example.

I'd also like another winger/attacking player. Cuadrado and Salah aren't good enough. Moses won't stay. In an ideal world I'd like two to challenge mainly Oscar and Willian. They're both fine but don't create enough. If Hazard has an off game then we don't really create anything.

This will change off course if/once i return which would put me in the similar position as OP....

People dying will become just another death. We will essentially lose bits of our humanity. When that happens, things get bad.

But as far as I know Apple in fact forbid the provision of 3rd party tools which allow the normal user to program their devices. (Not sure what the policy is for Android.)

That allows Apple to keep the barrier very high to get into any kind of app programming. It's that kind of behaviour which is making it harder for children to get into things like this. Everyone is carrying around really powerful platforms with loads of sensors and a great screen, and no way to do anything creative themselves with it except interact with apps as 'consumers' (which seems to mean milking as much money as possible these days.)

null,false,LukeeT,null,null,null,"I think you are certainly allowed to have concerns but there are a number of big clubs that are also still yet to do a great deal in the transfer market. My main concern is regarding the constant average players we have been linked to.  
  
As things stand we have a team in the front running for the premier league, although I understand your justified point of previous winners of the premier league being complacent in the following summer, what shocks me more is the lack of business from the chasers. Utd have signed a winger to add to their collection without addressing cbs and centre of midfield. City are going too outrageous and not actually making any real strides yet. And superb-a-keeper that Cech is, Arsenal weren’t in dire need for a Keeper. They need a rb, strong centre midfielder, striker or two, physios and some mental strength if they can purchase that anywhere.  

We should be proactive for sure, but last year was an exception not the rule as we needed those positions desperately. This year we can afford to be a little reactive and wait to see what steps the chasers do.  

From a Champions league perspective, yes, I’d like to see a little more from Chelsea in terms of genuine interest in world-class players. But you also have to understand we as spectators are blind to a lot of what goes on. There is an obvious understanding between clubs as to where people are transferring. For example, there was no bid from anyone else on Turan simply because it was probably made clear to club representatives where he was going. Same for Lewandowski and Reus when he had the min fee release clause, why did no one else just throw a bid in like on Football Manager, well its because we don’t know whats been said behind closed doors. There may not be any deals we can go in for at the minute and we are waiting for the big players to start moving around and freeing up money etc.  

Lets hope that deals are going on behind closed doors and even if they are not, as long as PL boys don’t go mental in the market, we will have a good year with the current squad.

I was travelling to Bisley from Northern Ireland for a shooting competition with a group of kids from school and had to fly into London and get the train out. All the trains were suddenly cancelled while we were waiting for ours to Woking and nobody told us anything about why so we just assumed that someone had fallen in front of a train on the line and that's why all the trains were being cancelled. It didn't help that mobile signal was fucked because of everything that was going on so nobody could contact anyone.

Finally got a replacement bus from London to Woking after nearly 2 hours of handing around and our shooting coach met us in a panic telling me, matter of factly, that I had to call my parents right away. Turns out they had been desperately calling my coach to try and find out any news on me. Since none of us had any signal my coach didn't know anything either until we turned up at the station. 

So the first I found out about it was cheerfully calling my parents and them sounding more worried than I've ever heard them telling me about the bombings.

In Iraq and Afghanistan it's a different ball game, it's asymmetric guerrilla insurgents we are dealing with and the same conventional methods have been shown to not work, particularly afghan where even the Soviets at the height of their military power and indeed the British empire at the height of theirs got their arses handed to them.

I think this is the key point. The demands of our society require that sometimes human rights law needs to have exceptions. If the application of human rights requires judgement based on what the individual has done, if they are applied somewhat selectively, they aren't really universal. I fully understand the idea of conflicting rights that must be balanced, but practically this results in exceptions (this is without even going into the fact that often human rights laws conflict with, and are sometimes treated as secondary to, laws which are not based in human rights). You can call them something else if you want but there are still examples of 'in the case of x, y will not apply as it is supposed to', which is a type of exception.

Its not, but the point I was making about ISIS is that they are an anti-Shia organisation. Their purpose is to kill Shia Muslims. They are looking to create their caliphate somewhere between Iraq and Syria. Iraq is majority Shia, and there is a large minority Shia population in Syria. In addition, Iran is just across the boarder, which is also a majority Shia country. ISIS will never be allowed to create any sort of permanent base in that area, it is inconceivable, there will never be any compromise over it. Either ISIS will take the land by force, or they will be driven away by force. Either way, it will be a military conflict. The choice the West has to make is do we help the people fighting ISIS, or do we ignore them. Either way, there is going to be violence and people are going to die.

City have signed no one, United depay and arsenal cech. Not behind in that respects, Liverpool have but I can't see them signing anyone else tbh and who they've signed will only have them competing for top four.

Unlike most on this sub I don't think we need a 'marquee signing'. We're not competing with real Madrid or barca as they spend stupid amounts on players we can't afford. People will end up disappointed if they have that mentality and I've seen it a lot on here. Our first team on its day can beat them and that's how it'll stay. They're not in our league and the league is priority. We'll want to do well in the champions league but we can and should reach the quarters. From there anything can happen.

Personally think we need more cover or depth or whatever you call it. Centre back, left or right back, goalkeeper seems sorted,  and a centre mid possibly if a) mikel or ramires is sold or b) Loftus cheek doesn't fill in as much as he probably should. I'm also a bit worried about centre back but I'm not sure who is actually available who could help us either so we might sit on our hands with that and hope someone becomes available.

We might well be up to something but it's being kept quiet. Look how quick fabregas happened. Was a massive shock. Difficult to know or slag anything off yet.

Since then he's had one or two loan moves and at least one, maybe two fairly serious injuries and did not impress with his ball usage on his one chance under Martinez last year before going out again to Cardiff where he was fairly inconsistent, by most accounts I've seen.

He's twenty two now, he'll be twenty three by the time the season starts, so if he doesn't make a splash and show Bobby that he's ready, I think a move to the Championship seems the most likely outcome.

What? The shit in the Balkans happened in the 1990s. Many of the atrocities committed by Empires occurred after the Second World War. American oppression based off race continued legally well into the 1960s. What exactly did 'we' learn?

&gt; Where as in non white domanant countries they still act like savage animals slaughtering each other it the thousands and oppressing each other.

Again, just like the Balkans in the 1990s. Just like South Africa into the 1990s. Just like the American South into the 1960s. etc. etc.

&gt; Idi wasn't poor he killed millions because they was from a diffrent tribe.

After independence, Uganda needed to build an army. One of the reasons Idi Amin was promoted, despite being indited in atrocities while serving in the British Colonial army, was because there simply weren't enough qualified people in Uganda at the time to fill the roles. His promotion was a by product of the lack of infrastructure during Empire.

I also didn't say the only reason bad things happen outside of Europe are because the people are poor. It's a factor, definitely, but it's among others. As I pointed out, a lack of national identity is another major factor. In Uganda, as in many other African countries, this saw people identifying more with their ethnic group than with their nation, simply because the post-colonial borders were largely completely arbitrary. Many Middle Eastern countries are racked by religious tensions, again a sign of people identifying more with a cultural group than a national one. That doesn't happen in Europe, simply because our 'nations' have been around for a lot longer.

Following it through with your answers, it looks as though you're **already** British **if** your parents were married before or after you were born.

This way you can just apply for a British passport, sending the necessary proof.

However, even if they weren't married it looks as you can **become** British by **registration**, see here:

https://www.gov.uk/register-british-citizen/born-before-2006-british-father

This takes you to an important guidance leaflet, [pdf here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437048/guide_ukf_registration_of_a_person_born_to_unmarried_parents_june_2015.pdf). Read it carefully. Your problems are going to come if your father is not named as such on the birth certificate, if you're not in touch with him.

Your issue under both routes, either an entitlement to British citizenship or registration as a British citizen, will be proof. Immigration is very political in the UK at the moment. Whilst your application will be granted if you meet the criteria, do *not* expect to be given the benefit of the doubt if any evidence is missing or not quite what they're asking for. Given the size of the fees, and the waiting times, you should do all your detective work in advance.

If you need copies of birth certificates (maybe your father) or your parents' marriage certificate, then you can do so [here](https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate).

Feel free to PM me in the future if you have any difficulties, as I sort of work in this field.

EDIT:-

(1) The fee for registration is £913! (=$1,400). Hope that you're already a British citizen.

(2) This sentence from the guidance should give you an idea what you can expect from UKVI: ""Applications are considered quickly – usually within six months of receipt.""

Matic is the base of that trio, but we could use an upgrade for rami/mikel in the form of a b2b midfielder, but i trust mou to always have the defense on his mind when perusing the window. Zouma will play much more this year, possibly at cdm at times,  terry is not likely to play near as much, so zou/cahill will get some more looks. I could see ivan slipping in if needed and azpi playing RB for a change, we could use a new CB or LB but not necessarily a starter. Begovic would be a suitable bench-keeper if that happens.

Our cm's are more than fine, with Matic, ramires, fabregas, oscar, mikel, and RLC. Willian can also play behind the striker if he needs to. Another CB and fullback would also be ideal imo, since only having 3 in each position is kinda thin.

The ""Internet of Things"" is also going to be revolve around an ecosphere more akin to ""desktop PCs"" than microcontrollers.

And then there's dose and rose and lose,
Just look them up, and goose and choose.

And cork and work and card and ward,
And font and front and word and sword.

And do and go, then thwart and cart.
Come, come, I've hardly made a start.

A dreadful language? Why, man alive,
I'd learned to talk it when I was five,
And yet to write it, the more I tried,
I hadn't learned it at fifty-five!

Because  there are not enough training schemes out there to meet the demand. It needs more government funding because construction firms are quite content to bring in skilled workers from overseas.

I agree, but I also think that there was a lot of pressure on the government from the public and the media to leave Iraq and Afghanistan before those countries were fully prepared to defend themselves. If we had properly trained them, ISIS would be much less of a problem today. ISIS wouldn't have their weapons for a start.

 I think leaving so early was a big mistake, and i'm hesitant to say it, but the whole ""anti war"" movement that was around at the time is partially to blame for the situation now. Of course the government of the time takes the most blame for bowing to public pressure like it did and leaving before the job was done. Sometimes the role of the government is to do the unpopular thing. 

I think its also important to remember that many of the current problems in the middle east would still have occurred, without western intervention. The Arab spring happened for totally unrelated reasons, and would still have spread across the region. How would Saddam have reacted to an Iraqi uprising? ISIS would still have found its foothold somewhere, so it's unfair to blame the west for the creation of ISIS, which some people try to do. 

&gt;The end game has to diplomatic, 

What kind of diplomacy do you think could happen? What kind of deal or agreement? Because I seriously cannot see anything of the sort happening?

This is a slightly better article from behind the Times paywall:
&gt;Chelsea have offered about £11 million a year to use Wembley as a temporary home while Stamford Bridge is rebuilt.
The club have made a presentation to Wembley Stadium’s board and want to play at the national stadium for three seasons, probably from the start of the 2017-18 campaign.
Chelsea appear to have stolen a march on Tottenham Hotspur, who will need to leave White Hart Lane for at least one season from 2017 as their new stadium is built and are thought to have offered Wembley about £8 million a year.
The Wembley board is facing strong pressure from the Premier League clubs to use the 90,000-capacity stadium but is not believed to have made a decision on whether to rent it to a team, which could have a knock-on effect for other sporting and music events that generate money.
There could also be planning issues to negotiate because the number of events that can be staged in a year at Wembley is restricted, if the attendance is above 50,800, although the constraint can be circumvented if the top tier is closed to fans.
Other factors for the board to take into account include the stadium being used for American football matches in autumn at present — there still being the possibility of a London-based NFL franchise — and the FA contemplating staging England home matches around the country again after 2017. This would happen after the initial ten-year debentures, which underpin the £757 million stadium’s business plan, have expired.
Chelsea, who revealed architects’ plans for their proposed new stadium last week, approached the Rugby Football Union about using Twickenham as a temporary venue last summer, but there would be significant issues in obtaining planning permission for an increase in the number of events, in the face of hostile local residents.
There are also issues about segregation and potential political barriers. Vince Cable, the former MP for the borough, voiced his concerns about the idea of Chelsea using the ground when he wrote to the RFU in September.
Chelsea plan to hold a formal public consultation about their new stadium plans in September and the club expect to lodge a planning application to Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council by the end of the year. The plan is that the team would return to their rebuilt stadium from 2020.
Tottenham are at risk of losing the race for Wembley, despite having informal talks with stadium officials a number of years ago. The north London club are reluctant to try to seek permission to share the Olympic Stadium because of a poor relationship with West Ham United, who won a bitter battle between the clubs to rent the stadium from the 2016-17 season.
Tottenham also fear that the 54,000-seat stadium will be heavily branded by the east London club, which could lead to problems for their fans.
Tottenham considered using Upton Park, which has been sold to Galliard to turn the site into 700 homes, but there would be substantial costs of refurbishing the stadium because everything will be ripped up when West Ham leave at the end of the new season.
Tottenham appear to be confident of striking a deal to use stadiummk in Milton Keynes, if all else fails, despite their fans citing “serious issues” with the venue in a poll conducted by the Tottenham Supporters’ Trust in September last year.
Tottenham are expected to lodge a new planning application for a 61,000-seat arena, with the necessary facilities to play American football matches, which the club hope could help to attract a partner for funding the development. The club were given permission to build a 56,000-seat stadium three years ago and started their project in 2007.

We also look light in the middle, Paulinho Holtby Capoue all out rumours about Stambouli and Poch hasn't shown a whole lot of faith in Dembele. Poch has shown a tendency to show faith in younger players, so at the very least having a young talent around the first team working with him in an environment where first team minutes (even if restricted to substitute or early rounds of cup/group stage of EL) are an attainable goal that could really bode well for his development.

Part of the reason Bentaleb is such a darling is that he has the composure and level of comfort on the pitch that is beyond his years. You see it with Raheem Sterling as well, you give Delle Alli a year around the first team and suddenly he's a 20 year old with a year of experience and development with the first team coaching staff under his belt.

Plus, it's just a really good attitude for a young player to have imho",null,0,null,1436272756,null,0,false,0,csuw9jz,null,t3_3cf1g7,null,t1_csuw9jz,null,t3_3cf1g7,null,null,null,1437652338,null,21,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,21,null

I refer you back to your original comment -

&gt; **All** those guns from Libya came from somewhere. I will give you a clue, it was us

According to you, we are talking about 'all'. But in any case, it doesn't matter. It's pretty meaningless to refer to the West as ""us"" given that the UK doesn't have control over the US or other EU countries export control laws, gun laws, or their enforcement agencies. The US is drastically different in terms of gun laws and export controls compared to the UK, so referring to both as ""us"" as if we are the same, like-minded countries with the same policies is ridiculous. 

I think UK arms traders selling Libya 3000 guns is an awful thing to do, but it clearly wasn't government policy. HMRC don't have the resources to stop every trade, and Gadaffi was willing to pay stupid amounts of money for his doomsday prepping so clearly some UK based arms traders got through. I get the feeling that you don't know as much as your morally righteous condemnation of the UK demands, perhaps you should read up on the history of the arms trade in the UK, the ATT (which we co-authored and are spearheading), the Export Control Order and the licencing system and what HMRC and the police actually do to combat illegal arms trading.

The why? My thoughts are that ageing or maturation of a cigar is done by obtaining a slow exposure to oxygen over time, not fresh new oxygen which I would get almost all of the time from my other humidors which are opened most days. The idea being that you want to let your cigars age gracefully.


I also like to keep cigars which I am trying to mature inside the original boxes to create a buffer zone between humidor and outside air so that if I do open the humidor it doesn't directly affect the wrappers of the cigars I am laying down for rest, or at least it affects them in as minimal a way as is possible.

The Doc has some good articles and this one touches on ageing, it is worth a read.



&gt; Keep Humidity Lower Than 70%
For long-term aging I would recommend a humidity level of around 63–68%RH. A lower humidity level will allow the flavors and aromas of the cigar to concentrate more. As you allow some of the moisture to evaporate, the essential oils will concentrate within the tobacco. Those oleoresins are what contain the flavor and aroma particles. Also, a lower humidity will counterbalance any propensity of the tobacco to develop mold. The only caveat with this approach is that you must be sure not to allow the tobacco to become too dry, which would eventually cause the oleoresins to evaporate as well. I keep my cabinet humidors at 68%RH, which gives me a little margin for error and will accommodate all my cigars, even the ones not meant for long-term aging.

Instead we're getting depth, fine, but I thought we'd have at least £30m to splash around. I guess that the club might see that we just slowed down last season after being high up and doing well, and think that a few depth players will help us maintain that if our first team is good enough.  

But I'm just not sure that we'll have a team good enough to battle on many fronts successfully. I'd like to give PL, EL and a cup a good run, and I feel like with the rotation necessary we won't have a strong enough team in any single competition unless we get a couple more high-level signings in.

3 center backs have limited success in the prem. I'm no expert, but I think that may be because it's harder to coordinate the shape, especially with regards to tricks such as the offside trap. With comparatively the fastest attackers in Europe, the prem poses a heightened risk of letting a striker or winger in behind the back line. Three center backs would have to all communicate amongst each other to respond to players like Aguero who are terrific at riding the back shoulder of center backs and breaking at just the right time. I think those players would be even harder to defend against when you have a third chef in the kitchen so to speak.

Additionally, I think having a single DM would place far too much responsibility in link-up and defense. In my mind, DMs cover the band of the pitch that sits in front of the back line, this rings especially true for a formation that calls for attacking full-backs like our's. Even though we apply team-wide pressure in defense, I think our front four would be too far forward and our back 3 (or 5) would not be in the right position to help boss the midfield or try for interceptions with that single DM. Couple that with the task of feeding four (or six, if you count our FBs again) attackers from a single distributor in our own half, and you can see where this formation would be quite difficult unless you have a truly game-changing deep-lying midfielder (Matic comes to mind) AND very intelligent, very quick center backs (I don't know many of those who would also be physically strong enough to contend with the bigger alternatives like Andy Carroll or Christian Benteke).",null,0,null,1436273312,null,0,false,0,csuwhf1,null,t3_3cf3vz,null,t1_csuwhf1,null,t3_3cf3vz,null,null,null,1437652452,null,27,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,27,null

We don't have a great backup in Caballero - while he's passable and has made Joe better, he's never going to push to be a replacement. So I like the idea that in a year or two, after some time away, Gunn might be able to succeed Willy in the first team.

The software stack has to be child-friendly. This means no compiler required - a web-based service allows the kid to code online and download it straight to the chip. So it needs to be reprogrammable straight fro USB (like mBed).

Then, you need an environment that kids can use. Microsoft is providing that, AFAIK.

It got to the point where Azelle Rodney's mother brought a case to the ECHR claiming her human rights were breached by the failure to hold a prompt and proper investigation in order to bring the matter to a close.

The Police can't complain about an investigation being drawn out when they themselves are impeding it's prompt conclusion!

It wasn't until a full-scale Public enquiry got that redacted evidence released that it became apparent the killing could be unlawful, which gave the CPS enough evidence to pursue a prosecution.

There is *quite rightly* no statute of limitations on murder so if new evidence comes to light, then it's entirely proper that a case should be reviewed and charges potentially brought.


^1 This is a problem in and of itself. Certainly, there are cases where you may need to redact documents to protect undercover officers or sources. But that redaction should only be applied on documents released to the public. The Police have shot (and thus potentially murdered) a member of the public - they should not be entitled to decide how much information they do or do not give the Coroner (who has a role to play in deciding whether the killing was lawful or not!). The Coroner should get *everything they need*, as soon as they ask for it.

It is a very very cool card as i'm running 1.3v at 1550MHz on the core and it never goes above 70c. It usually hangs in low 60s.

Inaudible up until 80% fan speed which it never hits during gaming unless you set a custom fan curve.

Will come in original box in an anti static bag and I will put the latest drivers on a disc if you require it.

Has been owned since November and only BIOS modded it since last month so no degradation could of happened in that time. Still in pristine quality.

I can provide order number upon request in case RMA is needed.

null,false,houseaddict,null,null,null,"&gt; I agree, but I also think that there was a lot of pressure on the government from the public and the media to leave Iraq and Afghanistan before those countries were fully prepared to defend themselves. If we had properly trained them, ISIS would be much less of a problem today. ISIS wouldn't have their weapons for a start.

You know I see exactly where you are coming from but I can also understand that after more than a decade of post war training and shit loads of wasted lives to a lot of people it looked like a lost cause. We shouldn't have been there in the fucking first place basically. Did we pull out too early? Maybe, I can certainly see the argument for that however it's by no means certain that even if we stayed 50 years the outcome would be any different.

&gt;I think its also important to remember that many of the current problems in the middle east would still have occurred, without western intervention. The Arab spring happened for totally unrelated reasons, and would still have spread across the region. How would Saddam have reacted to an Iraqi uprising? ISIS would still have found its foothold somewhere, so it's unfair to blame the west for the creation of ISIS, which some people try to do.

Yes, quite possibly true but I think it's fair to say we have made it worse.

&gt; What kind of diplomacy do you think could happen? What kind of deal or agreement? Because I seriously cannot see anything of the sort happening?

With any conflict you always end it by diplomacy, even a fight between 2 individuals will always end with them either agreeing to stop fighting or one of them getting battered to the point of not being able to. We can't batter them into submission, that's the nature of insurgencies, therefore the only remaining option I can see is diplomatic.",null,0,null,1436274328,null,0,false,0,csuwwf1,null,t3_3cbizo,null,t1_csuwwf1,null,t1_csuw7a0,null,null,null,1437652740,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; Wimmer and Vertonghen can play at LB.

LCB and RCB in a 3 (or 5) defensive system are not known as (or generally play as) full-backs; just because our CBs have been able to play full-back does not mean they can play LCB/RCB in a 3 CB system.  

The only thing that would guarantee that a CB could make that switch, is if they have done it (correctly) before.  Given practice, any of our CBs could work out... but I don't think any of them have a 3/5 back pedigree.  

&gt; When attacking, you have a CM, a CAM, a CF and four overlapping Wingers.

When we are in possession now, we have our full-backs overlap our wide(r) mids... in addition to 2 deeper midfielders, an advanced midfielder and a striker. This would take one of the central midfielders away and put them into the defense... maybe Vertonghen (or someone else that feels comfortable) steps up into the midfield, in possession, but I'd rather that spot go to someone who is an actual midfielder.  

It's an interesting idea, don't get me wrong... but typically if a manager wants to play that kind of formation/system, they buy players that have done it before.  Otherwise, you look like QPR.

&gt;Because there are not enough training schemes out there to meet the demand. It needs more government funding because construction firms are quite content to bring in skilled workers from overseas.

null,false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"Profit is needed because by merely breaking even all you ever do is tread water. 

Let's take houses for example. Houses today are far better than houses 100 years ago because advancements in technology and construction practice have been made. None of that would have happened without profit, because if I build a house for £81,391 and sell it for exactly that, that's £0 left over once I've paid the building crews and paid off the materials.

What *you* want is a world where no one gets rich by being in charge of these things. That's equally as impossible, because jobs with more responsibility and requiring more experience to do properly demand higher wages, else no one would do them. Why run a company if I can get similar money doing something much, much easier?

Why should a farmer get up every day at 5am to deal with his animals and work 12-14 hour days in the fields if he can't get a big house out of it? Why should a Doctor work 60 hours a week after going through 7 years training if he can't get paid well above average salaries?

There's a very small number of people who successfully scam the system and get a lot of money without arguably deserving it, but they come from all walks of life and live on all income levels.

People who scam the benefit system are acting selfishly. Footballers who get paid millions a year to play a sport are acting selfishly. Bankers who manipulate stocks and award themselves fat bonuses are acting selfishly. Elected politicians who take tax money and spend it on things that don't benefit everyone are acting selfishly.

You're making an argument that the only selfish people in the world are company owners who make a profit on building houses, selling food and selling electricity.

Even socialised versions of all the above aren't fair. I've been to hospital three times in my whole life for butterfly stitches: never once spent a night there, never once taken anything more than 15 minutes of a nurses time and however much a set of sticky butterfly stitches cost. Yet I pay the exact same National Insurance as a Diabetic who receives regular medicine and regular attention from the medical profession.

You're upset that people are making money from you because of your need for a house. Is it not equally valid to be upset that people are making money off of me for something I don't even use?

You can't escape having to pay for stuff, and it doesn't matter if it's socialised or privatised you're going to be paying someone (be it through payment or taxes) to do something you can't do yourself. The Government never runs things strictly at cost: your taxes don't vary every month to cover services and nothing more, do they? The Government spends a lot of money on research, on subsidies for various things, on projects for various things, on the military, on international aid, and so on.

A system where you're never subsidising anything but your own immediate needs does not exist.

null,false,brokenairguitar,flair5,,null,"&gt; What if of the 3 centre backs, the middle one drops deep as a sweeper?

A few problems here, most notably with the fact that this now creates a sort of 2nd back line of one.

1. You'd need someone who is quick enough laterally to cover three gaps (lb-lcb, lcb-rcb, rcb-rb), tall enough to head away balls sent to target men, and intelligent/mentally strong enough to command the other two defenders. We don't have that in Fazio and Vertonghen is probably too loose with his focus to be trusted in this role given his current form. Dier is not experienced enough to be expected to fill this role.

2. Savvy teams don't just break through with one and try to score from there. When a team like City breaks through this 4 and 1 back line that you've proposed, it's not just Aguero who gets through. It's also Navas and Silva who have come to join. You can't expect a sweeper to be able to quicky discern who to mark/challenge and who amongst his line to delegate to contend with the others (if he has to communicate). If he doesn't, then you have to be certain that the back line is in tune with each other enough to be able to respond collectively. I can't imagine in a league like our's with as many injuries as teams have (our past season was fluky in the best way health-wise) that we can expect this either.

Insofar as your link-up comment, I don't think going down the flanks is meant for us for two reasons:

1. Our wings are not natural-sided wingers, but inverted. Chadli is more of a wide forward and Lamela is a wide 10. Townsend is a bit better in terms of what we'd need, but he's also being inverted. Our full-backs (barring Trippier, who I believe is quality with his crosses) are also poor in terms of distribution.

2. Going down the flanks while you look to distribute means you only have one direction to send the ball to (center) whereas going through the middle means you have at least two, sometimes all three directions to move the ball. We limit ourselves by going down the flanks directionally, not to mention we are taking the ball off the feet of our best playmaker (Eriksen).

1. People never vote for parties that *will* nationalise these things. People get the opportunity every five years to make that call and as a society they never take it. Answering a poll with no consequences to it and voting in a government that will put taxes up to afford nationalising everything are two deeply different acts. The voters voted in a party that said they'd privatise them, and that's what happened. Where's the renationalisation vote? It doesn't exist, because it's clearly not that important to people.

They were wrong.


They came through.... side ways.... in little peices, bits would fall off them randomly. I'd wake up in the morning, cough, and be spitting out bits of teeth which had come through my gums that night. From this, got an incredible infection, and they managed to damage the back of my molars too due to the pressure.

Eventually after much fun with the dentist checking them, saying 'we can't do anything until the infection goes away' it eventually did (with antibiotics) and he checked them again. His response was 'Oh dear, I *could* try and remove them for you, but it'll likely go wrong and you'll need to go to the hospital for an emergancy extraction, or I can just refer you to have it done.'

I got referred, 2 months later they were removed (I chose to be asleep) and that afternoon i was eating a burger king, while still coughing up mouthfuls of blood.

You talk a lot of shit. There was no morally righteous condemnation, just asserting the facts that a lot of Western countries provided weapons to oppressive regimes. These weapons are then used against our troops and our citizens. 

Your point seems to come from the fact that we sold then 3000 guns, all of which you think we're sold without government knowledge and must have been illegal sales. 

I do not think you understand how arms deals work. Our MPs are pretty much defacto sales reps for British arms companies. We didn't just sell them guns we sold them support vehicles such as armored land-rover etc. 

Tony Blair made a huge deal of an arms deal with Libya and the tories have and will do the same for other oppressive regimes. 

Have a look at this report:

https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/countries/libya/uk-gaddafi

Some key points that are at odds with your comments that this was small number of arms deals without government approval. 
The military-list licences approved for Libya are valued at millions of pounds each year and have included everything from armoured vehicles to heavy machine guns to ""crowd control ammunition"". Examples of individual licences include:

On 27 January 2011, only weeks before the uprising, a licence was issued for the unlimited export of ""military communications equipment""
On 26 November 2010, a £28,550 licence was issued for equipment including ""weapon sights"" and ""weapon night sights""
On 12 July 2010 a licence was issued for £2,757,094 worth of ""ammunition for wall and door breaching projectile launchers"", ""crowd control ammunition"", ""small arms ammunition"", ""tear gas/irritant ammunition"" and ""training tear gas/irritant ammunition"". A similar licence was approved two months earlier.
On 17 September 2008 a licence was issued for £4,759,356 worth of ""armoured personnel carriers"" and ""components for armoured personnel carriers"".",null,0,null,1436275330,null,0,false,0,csuxc5c,null,t3_3cbizo,null,t1_csuxc5c,null,t1_csuw9xg,null,null,null,1437653098,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,themanifoldcuriosity,null,null,null,"&gt; No, that's not what he said at all

You put it right there in black and white: ""Brand's solution to stopping terrorism is to... stop invading and bombing countries around the world.""

We've invaded two countries in the last decade or so: Iraq and Afghanistan. The former was in the grip of a dictator who literally murdered a million of his own people and caused many more of that to suffer unnecessary though his own policies. The latter was a place in which a repressive regime killed little girls for attending school. So actually yeah, you are saying that Russell Brand's solution was to keep out of all that.

But let's go further than that, we also intervened in the Balkans, doing exactly the same kind of thing as we did in the middle east. Show me all the Serbian terrorists we're dealing with now.

&gt; A conventional war as are the rest of your examples

And that means what? Malaysia and Vietnam were counter-insugencies - show me where that resulted in terrorism against the invading nation. We invaded Germany because they committed aggression against neighboring states and had contravened long standing international agreements on their conduct. Exactly like the various invasions of Iraq. Show me the German terrorists.

&gt; Would they be there if we hadn't intervened though?

No, but Saddam would be. Remember him? The dude who invaded two countries and killed a million of his own people? The one you're saying we should have left in place as part of a policy that is ""not retarded""...

&gt; The end game is diplomatic, which by the way is how all of those conventional conflicts ended as well.

ROFL. WWII didn't end through diplomacy, it ended because Germany was beaten until it surrendered. As did Argentina. Vietnam and Iraq saw allied forces pull out - **against the recommendation of those concerned for the future of those countries** (so not Russell Brand) - due to public pressure. Vietnam (and the rest of Indochina) then saw many times the number of civilian deaths than those seen when the US was in country. And as for Iraq, well we can all see what happened there. So when you say diplomacy, it's obvious what you actually mean is ""I don't know anything about the relation of diplomacy to world affairs - I do know it means ""not war"" though).

When a company or bank went bankrupt in RoI, NAMA would buy the property portfollio. Many of these companies, although based in the RoI had property in NI.

RoI decided let's sell some of these properties owned by NAMA and raise much needed funds for the people of RoI. Many of these properties were in NI. Many NI parties didn't want them to do this as cheap property (commercial mainly) would have flooded the market and thus slowed down the NI commercial sector growth.

An American firm bought all the NI properties for just over a billion but Mick Wallace (him with the long hair, a former very wealthy businessman gone bankrupt) said there was 7m of that billion set aside for a Northern Ireland politician who was going to help push that deal through. Saying this doesn't mean anything when there is no proof... However.

The law firm Tughans (who were providing advice and guidance on the buy out) one of their managing partners (now former) put 7m in an Isle of Mann bank account IN HIS NAME (tax free) and that was reportedly set aside for the NI politician.

Peter himself met with the American firm who wanted to buy the NI portfolio.

NOTE - In my mind there is nothing suspicious about Peter Robinson meeting with the American firm in his capacity as FM. If he met him as party leader or as a civilian, that would raise an eyebrow but if he met the US firm as FM, it's only natural that the FM would want to meet a company which is buying 1bil worth of property in your jurisdiction.",null,0,null,1436276386,null,0,false,0,csuxu8g,null,t3_3cf219,null,t1_csuxu8g,null,t3_3cf219,null,null,null,1437653571,null,7,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,7,null

Hardware collaboration is a lot harder than software, as one small change to hardware can significantly impact the rest of the design. That is less common with software.

They would also be pressured by free market competition into providing stable and competitive pricing rather than price gouging - but of course the economies of scale to allow this to happen didn't exist in the market as it was privitised.

In fact what happened is that the privatised companies were conglomerated by large european utility companies into near monopolies and, as there was virtually no real money in the consumer energy market, all became vertically integrated (owning generation as well as supply). They were successful in their efforts to craft legislation that benefited them because as both the supplier and generator the government was utterly beholden to them for a functioning energy market, so there is essentially no competition.

Ultimately privatisation made the government accounts look good for a brief period and the public was instead bilked for more money from its own pocket book rather than the government's.

The former was in the grip of a dictator who literally murdered a million of his own people and caused many more of that to suffer unnecessary though his own policies. The latter was a place in which a repressive regime killed little girls for attending school. So actually yeah, you are saying that Russell Brand's solution was to keep out of all that.

Yeah, those are the reason we invaded, to stop all that.. sure. Where next, Zimbabwe or North Korea?


&gt; And that means what? Malaysia and Vietnam were counter-insugencies

Yeah I know that, and piss poor examples because the western powers lost both of those wars just like we lost against the iraq and afghan insurgencies. You've just proved my point.

&gt; No, but Saddam would be. Remember him? The dude who invaded two countries and killed a million of his own people? The one you're saying we should have left in place as part of a policy that is ""not retarded""...

So you tell me, which dictator shall we go after next? Putin maybe?

&gt; ROFL. WWII didn't end through diplomacy, it ended because Germany was beaten until it surrendered.

Yes it did, you're ignorant of history, look at all the treaties that were signed and agreed to by both parties : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe

What is a surrender anyway? Yeah that's right agreeing to stop fighting, i.e diplomacy. 

&gt; Vietnam and Iraq saw allied forces pull out - against the recommendation of those concerned for the future of those countries

Oh my days.. ok go on then, who was that exactly and please I would love to hear more about how those in charge of this mess were really concerned about the state of Iraq and its people. Those wars were ended because it was costing the west too much and public opinion (to a much lesser extent), they didn't give a damn about how many iraqis or vietnamese were killed.

I wrote this story… getting on two years ago now, more or less. While I’d started it earlier, by the time I finished it, I decided that it’d be a 50th Anniversary celebratory story.

At time of writing I was also reading the Target novelisation for The Dalek Invasion of Earth, which had quite a large influence on the characterisation of the leads and the style of prose.

I’m quite pleased with it, as it goes. It’s by no means perfect, obviously; I think that Susan doesn’t have a big enough part, and Barbara probably isn’t characterised perfectly. I’m also a teeny bit worried now, in hindsight, that some of the historical aspect isn’t handled quite as sensitively as it should have been; the details are all correct, but the presentation might not be quite right.

On the whole though, I’m proud of it. I stumbled across it again recently, and I thought it was actually pretty good - maybe one of the best things I've written, frankly - and I decided it'd be worth sharing it.

Hope you like it!

A company you start yourself is a huge huge risk that may not work out. And even if it does work out, will you make enough in enough time to be able to gift her 20k a year for what, 30 years  or a lump sum equivalent that can give her 20k a year for the rest of her life ? is that even her target required income ? What if your company goes bust 10 years down the line, 20 ?  [50% of new businesses fail within the first 5 years in the UK](http://www.ehow.co.uk/how-does_5212542_many-businesses-fail-first-year_.html)


Here's the thing, you are what ? 20/21 years old ? you *can afford* to take the risk on a company working out, because you literally have time to start over if it doesn't. But your mum doesn't have that time available. She should have her own plan to have an income in retirement. Saying 'she can't retire' *is not good enough an answer* .  People's bodies start breaking down as you get older. It gets harder and harder to do an 8 hour working day. My own mum at 65 now was struggling with that at 60 years of age.  She needs a target age at which she wants to retire and a plan to get her an income for that. 10 years of compound interest on a lump sum (you can add an amount equal to your salary every year and still get tax relief on it) and regular contributions from her and her employer to a pension are perfectly capable of achieving that based on what you've said, and thats a very low risk approach to retirement income. A 20k income for life and owning her own home are within reach based on what you've said.

If your company works out, great , but imo it's far far far too high risk for her to be betting her retirement on - retirement planning is all about low risk , which is the opposite of your idea.

I don't mind what side we get a new fullback on but I'd take a new player whenever a top player (or potential top player for the future) becomes available. If Azpillicueta stays as LB for the rest of his time its not a bad situation. I also think Willian's attacking output no matter how much its limited to defensive work is also down to the fact that he always go onto the outside on his right foot. On the right wing he only has one trick and he doesn't dribble into the box and cut into shoot like Hazard does on the other side. Aside from that his trick does work a lot surprisinly when he goes on the outside of the defender and smashes it across the box but I cant tell you how many times I've seen Willian get past his man whip it across the face of the goal and Costa or anybody is nowhere to be found. Costa **always** moves back expecting it to be cut back for him and played to his feet. He should be getting across the face of goal a lot more as well, especially when Willian is on the right because like I said Willian plays dangerous balls across the face of goal so many times and it just goes out for a throwing because nobody is there to tap it in. Also Ivanovic still is a brilliant defender, for a chunk of last season he wasn't good but in matches like the Arsenal match at the Emirates or matches early on in the season he was brilliant, Ivanovic also does what Willian should be doing; which imo is Willian's fault. I cant tell you how many times there has been space behind the defenders for Willian to run into but he never does he goes wide out next to the throw in line and then just kills any chance we have at getting into the penalty area and being dangerous.

It's about bringing together a wide collaboration to improve digital literacy in the UK, with this micro as a focal point.

&gt;The micro:bit was first conceived by BBC Learning in 2012, and initially developed together with the BBC’s award-winning R&amp;D department. The scale and scope of this unique initiative has only been made possible by an unprecedented collaboration between 29 international organisations, pioneering start-ups and transformative education organisations.

&gt; The BBC is the overall editorial and project lead for the micro:bit, coordinating the partnership, micro:bit development and delivery, learning resources and on-air and online inspiration for teachers, schools and makers across the UK.

&gt; Product partners include:

    ARM - providing mbed hardware, software development kits and compiler services
    Barclays - supporting overall product delivery and outreach activities
    element14 - sourcing components and managing the manufacturing
    Freescale - supplying the sensors and USB controllers
    Lancaster University - creating and writing the micro:bit runtime
    Microsoft - providing the TouchDevelop web-based programming tools and hosting service as well as teacher-training materials
    Nordic Semiconductor - supplying the main processor and enabled Bluetooth Smart
    Samsung – connecting the BBC micro:bit to phones and tablets, and developing the Android app
    ScienceScope - distributing to schools and developing the iOS app
    Technology Will Save Us - designing the shape, look and feel of the device
    The Wellcome Trust – providing learning opportunities for teachers and schools*

Hi, I volunteer as a STEM Ambassador and at ""Raspberry (Pi) Jam"" events teaching kids to code where I can.

Your sentiment isn't true at all. Kids engage with real, physical things - they hardly care about things on a screen. They already have very impressive high-polygon 2d bumpmapped computer games with bloom effects to make pretty stuff on a screen - basic 2d graphics (draw a sprite at point x,y. Look, you can move it by adding 1 every loop!) just can't compete. They lose interest fast. print(""Hello World"") to a command line? Good luck keeping them interested in that.

Physical electronics are fun - they like playing with it and exploring what they can do with programming in the real world.

The nice thing about MicroBit, arduino etc is the possibility to program it on a computer, then attach a battery and it becomes a small, light portable object they can show people and explain how it works.

Some decades ago schools had turtle robots - a robot with wheels and a pen or marker that would draw whatever you programmed it to. Someone realised they could shave some costs (they weren't exactly expensive) by doing it on a screen instead with a 2d virtual turtle - which sucked all the fun out of it for everyone involved.",null,0,null,1436280652,null,0,1436280971,0,csv05t8,null,t3_3cezrr,null,t1_csv05t8,null,t1_csuxnfb,null,null,null,1437655413,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

For those students who have a keen interest in programming, Coding Clubs can be held after school or at lunch times to cater to that demographic, instead of changing the entire curriculum to specialize the education of all students to cater to a single industry.

Also, word processing isn't that simple. It only seems simple because you were taught how to do it from a young age, and there are some features of word processing that you won't run into just faffing about at home, but will be expected to know when you get out there into the real world.

Then, we have to decide if death by inaction were also considered. As you know, The doctor has stood by and done nothing on countless occasions; For example, though Donna begged him not to, he allowed almost everyone in Pompeii to be wiped out by Vesuvius. 

Finally we have to consider those who have perished not at his hand, but still due to his actions. These deaths include some of his Companions, Those that fight his wars at his side (such as UNIT) and even those that are dedicated to preventing him from reaching Trenzalore.

Being ""efficient in keeping possession"" is not all a RWer is for. Ivanovic should not be making those runs full stop but Willian never does even when he has masses of space to do so. Also I'm not even talking about Willian in that goal, i am using the run Ivanovic made as an example of what Willian rarely or never does. You're even contradicting what you said earlier, if you want fullbacks to attack then they should be the ones giving the width not the attacking player in front of them. Would you expect Azpillicueta to be making the runs and dribbles into the box and Hazard staying far out wide and doing nothing but ""efficiently keeping possession""? no........ Last thing because nothing seems to be getting through to you, I've already said how he beats his man and whips the ball across the face of the box i.e. another reason for a lack of ""offensive output"" from Willian is because there is hardly ever anyone running across the goal to tap in those balls he puts into the penalty area.

iPlayer was certainly expensive, but it also used a lot of existing third party kit (MS's DRM, Kontiki as a file delivery mechanism etc etc), but the truth is that a lot of stuff had to be built from the ground up, and the BBC really dragged a lot of rights holders kicking and screaming into more modern agreements to obtain the rights to do so.

Corbyn is the Russian candidate for leader, thats for certain. [His critical stance of NATO expansion and Russian containment](http://www.stopwar.org.uk/news/the-history-lurking-behind-the-crisis-in-ukraine-by-jeremy-corbyn-mp) and [accusations that we're apparently causing the whole crisis and need to 'talk with Russia'](https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-972b-Nato-belligerence-endangers-us-all#.VZvvO_lViko) is probably the reason for this (along with the bonus of a bankrupt and militarily disabled Britain), as he seems content to allow Russian troops to pour into Ukraine while Britain must apparently restrain from aiding liberal democracies on our doorstep. Not a single other Labour leader has had an interview or article dedicated to them by RT, I might add. 

The above article contains all you need to know about his long associations with radical Islamism and excusing it/endorsing it at every opportunity. 

Corbyn downplays and apologises for North Korea many times, but a rather prominent event is featured [here on his website](http://jeremycorbyn.org.uk/articles/nuclear-panic-of-a-warlike-world-2/), where apparently we should be A-okay with North Korea obtaining nuclear weapons, because the oh-so-evil West possesses them. Classic move of that good old far-left moral relatvisim, where a tyrannical regime conducting human experimentation, sterilising the disabled and literally burning dead bodies from concentration camps for field fertiliser is just as entitled to nukes as the West.

Good job Corbyn is slamming the Saudis, I want us to be doing more of that, but it does interest me that the moral clarity he applies there apparently does not apply to the vast multitude of the West's enemies we are taking action against. It also fascinates me that he includes Israel (and not all the above) in countries we must take action against, despite its status as the only liberal democracy in the Middle East.

If play doesn't go his way, or if he can't get the ball from an opposing player he just completely shuts down and starts stomping his feet, even if the ball is still in play and he's the closest United player to it. 

During the pre-match warm up you'll see him taking screamers that no keeper would want to be in the way of, and a lot of the time they're on target too. During play he's either blasting the ball over or taking terribly weak attempts on goal.

He's shown no drive or desire to be with United for some time now. It almost comes across as arrogance, in the way that he feels he's not getting the support he needs from other players and feels he deserves better players around him, which isn't the case a lot of the time, and will become glaringly obvious when he starts playing for Celtic. At the same time you look at past strikers like Russell who gave everything, and would outperform Ciftci any day of the week, and you never saw a hint of arrogance, all while scoring numerous goals over the season. 

Ciftci played 31(?) games and scored 12 goals, which i think roughly half were from the penalty spot. 


Muirhead on the other hand made 10 appearances with 2 goals from open play, which makes it roughly about the same amount of goals on average as Ciftci scored from open play. In the second half of the season Muirhead played really well. He wasn't afraid to take a shot, and they were pretty good shots a lot of the time. He's also still very young and has drive and determination that was lacking from Ciftci for most of the season. He also seems to integrate a lot better within out current team whereas Ciftci seemed to think of himself as a lone warrior with an inability to pass the ball. I think Muirhead will integrate even more next season and we should see him easily beat Ciftci's goal tally.

Hes not on the pitch. But Hazard is wide in that goal creating the space for Ivanovic. I was saying IF Willian was on the pitch hed be in the position Hazard is in. 

&gt;Ivanovic should not be making those runs full stop but Willian never does even when he has masses of space to do so.

Ivanovic should be making overlapping runs, but you kept referring to that one specific goal so I commented specifically on that. Willian drifting wide adds spaces that the other forwards and Oscar are supposed to move into. Width is an invaluable tool for creating space, other wise we end up with games where we have 65% possession but no goals or shots.

Everyone pitches in meaning more people can work for less hours. Since you are only working to be provided the things you want/need and not working loads hours so you can afford to buy it yourself. You will have more time to spend with friends and family making life better in general.

There would be less need to make tons of diffrent brands that are outdated within a year since there's no more competition to make profit. Instead the aim would be to make long lasting quality products. Ruducing the vast amounts of economic waste we produce.

It's a good point that the physical interaction has some value, but is it the job of the BBC to develop and produce such a product? It seems to be quite similar to the Pi, which I believe was originally developed for educational purposes, and also the CHIP, which at $9 even a kid could afford. 


I'm not convinced that commercial ventures like this are the BBC's strong point, and, as I said earlier, the timing of the announcement that the BBC are to give away one million computers couldn't have come at a worse time with the job losses.

I don't think profit or money is needed at all. Scientists and reserchers wouldn't down tools if there was no money. I have never understood the obsession with money. Give the scientists and reserchers unlimited resorces and they would continue doing what they do as long as you also supplied them everything they need to live a happy normal life. 

Same with any industry keep doing what you are doing and instead of you buying what you want we will make sure you have it.

Everyone pitches in meaning more people can work for less hours. Since you are only working to be provided the things you want/need and not working loads hours so you can afford to buy it yourself. You will have more time to spend with friends and family making life better in general.

There would be less need to make tons of diffrent brands that are outdated within a year since there's no more competition to make profit. Instead the aim would be to make long lasting quality products. Ruducing the vast amounts of economic waste we produce. 

All this is in lala cookoo land though and it would never happen because greed is to powerful and it would take the whole of humanity working together to pull it off.

no i referred to it once because you didnt even look at it the first time. then you twisted around everything I said to make it about that one video. i literally repeated myself in that last comment saying ITS IS AN EXAMPLE of what Willian should be doing, which he doesnt do enough off. You're twisting my words and its not my fault you dont know what a fullback is meant to do, its ironic given what you posted earlier about wanting our fullbacks to attack. Let me make it clear for the last time, THE EXAMPLE of running into the box like in the video is what Willian doesnt do enough of ALSO as i've said from the very first comment when there is space behind defenders for him to run into he doesnt he goes out wide. You seem to think him going out wide keeping possession that leads to nothing is godly, thats what a fullback is for WIDTH so the attacking player in front has the ability to do what they are supposed to do which is attack and run into the box. Like I said with the Hazard and Azpi example it shouldn't be the way you describe it and whether or not you are commenting specifically on that goal what you're saying is completely stupid. You said the only reason Ivanovic has that space to get into the box is because Willian is giving width..... it should never be like that as I've said. Nobody would say Azpi should be making the runs into the box (like Ivanovic does) rather than Hazard (whilst Hazard is far out wide giving him that width). complete nonsense but when it comes to the right hand side you seem to be ok with ivanovic being a right winger and doing all the things that Willian should be doing. Also before you say this I'm not laying all the blame on Willian, I also said he makes tons of balls into the box but nobody is ever there to tap it in, yet you felt the need to reply in the next comment with ""Willian constantly beats his man"" even though I never complained. I'm giving reasons for Willian's lack of goals and assists rather than piling all the blame on our RB. Two other things being the fact that he doesnt make runs in the box when he should and also the fact that when he does whip it across the face of goal Costa isnt there to tap it in he almost always pulls back expecting a pass to his feet",null,0,null,1436284594,null,0,false,0,csv2nan,null,t3_3cffuu,null,t1_csv2nan,null,t1_csv26pu,null,null,null,1437657448,null,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0,null

Fast left wingers can do magic against Iva, but he is still great defender, tough, has a great stamina, great aerial contribution. cuts in between the lines while coming from the back. Magnificent defender. But he is not a natural RB choice. The way Mourinho played our right side last season was good, but we need to come with a better plan.

We would need to sign additional LB, like Rahman, keep Luis, or at least Ake (but it is not preferred to have 2 that young LB choices), Azpi returns to right side, And we keep Ivanovic to compete with Cahill for CB spot. Can play RB if it's needed, though.

EDIT: Forgot to mention. Our LB, azpilicueta, has no attacking contribution because he crosses with the right foot, and he has to cover for Hazard. The same thing Willian unfortunately does for Iva.

The letting agent might tell you that the landlords address for serving notices is that of the letting agent which is fine, if so you can also pay to do a land registry check on the flat and the landlords may be revealed - it's cheap like £3 iirc.

For the record, Ciftci scored 16 goals for United last season, 14 of them in the League. The season before he scored 17 (11 League). I've no idea how many of those were penalties and it's irrelevant. They're goals. 

However, as good a return as that is, his goals are only part of his massive importance to United over the past couple of seasons. In order to get the best out of players such as Armstrong, GMS and Gauld, you need to provide them with space. To get that you need a striker who can outmuscle a defence, chase down full-backs, force errors, basically give them a torrid time off the ball to the extent that they don't dare to come out of defence and close down those players playing in the gap between them and the midfield. Ciftci does that in barrowloads. The space that his physicality created for those players was a massive part of any good football played by United players in the past couple of years. 

His talent is raw, and yes he was frustrating at times with his preference for going alone when he had better options. Hugely frustrating. I think there were times, particularly in his second season, when he did think he was better than everyone else. But rather than that being a problem at Celtic, amongst better players I think he will thrive and become a far better player than he is now.

Muirhead, on the other hand, is a young lad with good potential. He came in towards the end of the season and he looks a good prospect. His all-round awareness, physical strength, skill and presence is not even in the same league as Ciftci at this present time. Besides, he won't even be the first choice striker next season, Bilate will.

&gt;hold up the ball extremely well so Couts..... can over lap

For me this is the issue. ""Changing"" here would not necessarily mean to just shoot the ball at his head to see if it bounces into goal. It could just mean that we'll try to get the ball to him as quickly as possible and get our other attacking players to overlap and try to score. This would put him further away from goal and put the pressure of scoring on the ones of our players who frankly aren't very good at it. It actually sounds a lot like what we expected Balotelli to do. And if it was anything that Balotelli did well, it was do hold the ball and let other players overlap - but it didn't work out. 

As I see it, Benteke and Balotelli aren't very different players. Benteke is arguably a lot better, but when it comes to the *style* of play, they're very similar. Yes they can run fast, but they're not used to pressing. Maybe Benteke can press - who knows. He hasn't been asked to do it at Villa. Yes they can play on the floor, but can they link up like Sterling and Coutinho link up with Suarez and Sturridge? Balotelli couldn't. Benteke might be able to do that, but he certainly hasn't been doing it for Aston Villa.

Benteke is a good attacker, but we expect a lot more than just ""running"" and ""play the ball"", because frankly, Balotelli can do both of those. We're asking Benteke to not just be a good striker, but to *fit in* to a style of play that he isn't used to from Aston Villa. 

Now I think that with the players around the striker, we don't need a world class striker to score. The rest of the squad is a lot better than it was when Suarez was here. With the players we have, if Rodgers can get the team going, I'm sure we'll do fine with a *good* striker, which Benteke arguably is. But for the price we seem to be willing to pay, I want more than just a *good* striker, I want someone who is good *and* is used to playing the kind of football we want to be playing.

I suppose my main issue with this is the way people allocate responsibility. When Brand, or whoever says the UK sold arms to Libya - if we make that more accurate and becomes ""a UK based private firm brokered the sale of arms between x East European company and Libya in a way that met UK export licencing laws, therefore HMRC had no reason to refuse the licence"" - I think there is there is blame laid on the government which isn't entirely fair. We have very strict criteria on risk of diversion, use of internal repression etc.

Certain MPs have a lot to answer for in facilitating this, no doubt. But I believe very strongly in taking the time to allocate blame and criticism accurately. Blame those MPs, blame those arms companies, make sure it is them who are being shouted at. Describing it as ""the UK selling arms to Libya"" allows those specifically responsible to hide behind ambiguity and generalisations. We should encourage the government to create stricter criteria for military export licences, and to encourage other countries like Canada and India to sign up to the ATT so the trade is made as transparent as possible, and then it will hopefully naturally become less irresponsible.

Also, you talk as if bailing out the banks are just throwing money at the problem. Bailing out a bank is the state buying up the shares of that bank. They become state run. Bonuses slashed, extremely strict corporate governance and not a good time for the executives. 

The idea that bailing out a bank is just the Government shitting on the little guys is a misunderstanding. A failed bank means an injection of uncertainty in to the heart of the economy. Businesses fail, jobs are lost and poverty shoots up.
