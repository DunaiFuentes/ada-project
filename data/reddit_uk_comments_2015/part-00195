Steer: 6 - Fine display, little dodgy at first, but looked fine later. Didn't have much to do. 

Bacuna: 4/5 - Bad crosses, not great defending, overall poor. 

Baker: 5 - At fault for our first goal largely, but again, didn't have much to do. Looked fine otherwise, and it was that mistake that brought his score down.

Vlaar: 6 - Not much to do, okayish. 

N'zogbia: 4 - Looked okay on the attack, but constantly got caught out in defence. What did we or Tim expect though, he's not a fecking left back.

Cleverly: 5 - Couldn't do anything but a side pass. Bit sloppy, lower work rate than usual, not great. 

Westwood: 7 - Thundering shot that second time, but the first shot was poor. Probably our best player all around though. ( :( )

Delph: 3/4 - Poor, poor, poor. Bad corner set pieces, no forward passing, little forward runs, not great decision making, poor crosses. Bad display from our player of the season.

Grealish: 5 - Kept losing the ball, didn't offer much, slowed down play. Poor display from him. 

Benteke: 6 - Made a fine header, but also had some poor decision making on some chances. Wasn't much of a presence, average display.

I think we should make an end of the season celebration thread bringing out why they are happy that the season ended. But without naming any names. 

For example:

* We don't have to watch the team playing without striker anymore as we will most probably get one or two.
* We don't have to watch the team playing without a right back as we will most probably get one. 

No, just me? Whatever.

It was a shit season from the beginning to the end. The big gambles didn't pay off but you have to admit that we probably drew the shortest straw frow every pot. I didn't see anything last season that would suggest that Sturridge will be completely fucked. It was unexpected. Can happen to anyone, but the worst was just the manner it happened. A season long injury would've been probably more acceptable to the fans and the club. The hopes were on him, his body didn't come through. I wrote the season off as soon as he got injured again around November. There was no way we could recover from that without performing miraculously well. 

This season went probably as bad as it could. It can only get better from now on.

However I feel like before this game people were pretty much ok with, more so then they are now anyway, the idea that Rodgers was staying. And I think that's the problem. 

If you take the three seasons as a whole you can make a pretty convincing argument that Rodgers hasn't done a very good job. But this match thread isn't that, it's an emotionally driven reaction to a 6-1 defeat to Stoke. Personally I think that at this point if you were content with Rodgers staying for next season before the start of this match, you should really be afterwards. Because that decision should be based on the whole season, and not a terrible shock result. We didn't qualify for CL, we didn't win a trophy, but if you were supportive of Rodgers before this match then nothing about that has changed. 

It's awful to see our team play like this but when I come to r/Liverpool I just think it's a shame to see these opinions change so drastically after one result. I could be wrong, but my take on this sub's opinion before this game was that we were overall content with Rodgers being given another chance next year, which is why I made the original post.

null,false,Daltesse,lfc12,,null,"the thing is that we have a decent squad. We have a squad that is designed for 4-3-3 and we have dept in most positions.Rodgers has tried to be too clever in his tatics and team selection. He's also given too many chances to the likes of Balotelli while discarded the likes of Borini too quickly. 

This preseaon the first thing to sort out is the manager position I'm a massive Rodgers fan. I do think he'll be a top boss but is still learning and making mistakes at the top level.  But that said, if we don't get Klopp, then I'd stick with Rodgers. 

Next thing to look at is the transfer commitee. I like the idea of a committee but only as part of the scouting network with the final say being with Rodgers.  We don't need a DoF but I would bring back someone like Kenny or Didi Hamman in a role to negotiate with players initially.

Once that is done the squad is the next thing to look at. We are Liverpool so we should have a style that we play 75-80% of the time. Therefore we need a squad that'll play that way most of the time. And we also need a few players to change things around when needed.

With that we also need a few more big players  not youngsters or over 30's but a big name in their prime. And after that we need a few mentally strong players bcause what we have is a decent tippy tappy team but don't have a leader a Souey, a Case, a Wark, a player who will rather kick his granny than lose.

I don't think that Rodgers will be here in 2 weeks time but I just hope we have a better manager to replace him and we should be wary of just replacing him, there's many bad decisions made in haste.",null,0,null,1432484575,null,0,false,0,crjf3ly,null,t3_373n43,null,t1_crjf3ly,null,t3_373n43,null,null,null,1433241303,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.""

Intermediate Level Apprenticeships give a qualification equivalent to a GCSE grades A*-C.

------

Apprenticeships should be like in Germany. A valued, respected alternative to university for industries where skills are required but direct experience is more relevant than academic foundation. *NORMAL MINIMUM WAGE PAID* (not 1/4 of minimum wage), and a qualification that is higher than A Levels, but lower than university, is given at the end.

All 16 year olds should do A Levels or a BTEC until they are 18.

There should be 4 choices for 18 year olds after this:

**A) University** (bachelor's degree)- for academic courses for industries where the theoretical aspects are very important, eg science [4/5 years]

**B) Technical Degrees**- for areas where going directly into the job, even being trained, would be too much, but they are not fully academic, eg. website/app development [2/3 years]

**C) Mixed Apprenticeships** (3 days work/2 days classroom)- for industries where direct experience is the main relevant factor, but many skills still need to be taught in a classroom [2/3 years]

**D) Direct Apprenticeships**- for industries where direct experience is the main relevant factor, and the skills can be taught on the job [2/3 years]

Of course if they don't want to do these, they should be able to get an unskilled job.

This was eye opening for me, like you said I'd always assumed I identify people as an 'in-group' and disregard colour of skin in an effort to accept racism isn't necessarily an inherent part of a person. In my concious awareness, I'm very anti-racist and just as worried about katie hopkins being given a platform as you are but being shown I had some of the same implicit biases occurring without me even being consciously aware of it really brought home just how insidious racism really is.

Akala's talked about this [elsewhere](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/mar/18/everyday-racism-what-should-we-do). He mentions he was at the bank and saw an Afro-Caribbean lad paying in a large sum of money  and his first reaction being suspicion. That someone as consciously aware about racism as Akala is liable to the same initial biases from which it manifests really demonstrates how deep rooted it can be.

I'm now much more worried about what this means for social media rather than for the broadcast media platforms after taking some reading over the last few months together.

Agger: past it and very injury prone.  It sucks but injuries caught up to him.  Agger wouldn't have gotten a start over Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren.  Maybe a start over Kolo.

Lucas: Don't really remembering him throwing him out to the cold.  He didn't play a ton of games because, again he was injured a lot of the season.

Glen: Should have played more I think, but most of the time he came on he was responsible for a defensive lapse/mistake that cost us.

Sakho: Got upset at not playing then walked out on the team.  Walking out is inexcusable I don't care how upset you are.  He then got injured so he was for a very long time.  Yes Sakho is better than Lovren, but you don't walk out on the team because the manager picked someone else.  For being captain of France/PSG all that stuff it shows some major immaturity from him.

As far as Rodgers' team selection I think he was trying to do a Roma, and it worked to great affect for 3 months.  Best thing Rodgers' did is go out and buy a bench.  Yes we needed a striker no doubt about that, but we also needed a bench very very badly.  You can see this season our consistent starting players have looked tired for the past month and that is where we need a bench.  Say all you want about this season, but Rodgers has done an excellent job is rebuilding this club into something promising.  For the first time in an extremely long time we have made a profit, so we can begin to get those big names.  We have a squad full of some of the most promising players in Europe.

Lord Hope (of the Supreme Court) ""repealing the Human Rights Act 1998 would, by itself, make very little difference to way such rights are enforced in our courts.""

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-the-human-rights-act-and-why-does-michael-gove-want-to-scrap-it-10240527.html

""In practice, this would likely mean that people who wanted to bring human right cases under the ECHR would have to go to a court in Strasbourg to be heard.""

https://fullfact.org/law/conservative-party-bill-of-rights-39308/

""The Conservative ideas don’t go so far. According to the most detailed explanation of its policy, published in October, the party wants to stay signed up to the ECHR, so that individuals could still ask the Strasbourg Court to make a ruling on whether or not their rights have been breached.""

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11626651/Britain-needs-a-Bill-of-Rights-forthe-individual-and-the-country.html

""the effort to scrap the Human Rights Act is not an attack upon human rights as a principle. It is a criticism of how they are currently applied in practice.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32733609

""The Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights, which we signed up to in the original European Convention on Human Rights. It will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society.""

""Among other things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.""

null,false,Oxshevik,null,null,null,"&gt; Society encourages them between it is considered liberation and equality for women to have casual sex rather than getting married and raising families. Began with Marx, who saw the family as hierarchical, and saw abolishing it as a means of fighting capitalism. Progressives get on board and gradually redefine promiscuity from a sign of evil and shame to a sign of liberation.

You probably haven't read Marx, and you certainly haven't understood him. Progressive have rightly worked to destroy the idea that promiscuity is shameful or evil, but that in no way supports your nonsense claim that they have ""encouraged unmarried women to engage in drunken casual sex"". As though progressives think they should be telling women what to do in the first place...

&gt; Actual rape is having someone force you to have sex

Again, you don't get to redefine rape. Rape is sex with a non-consenting person. End of.

&gt; Getting drunk with someone and having sex while drunk has not historically been rape 

Forcing yourself on your wife has not historically been rape. Luckily, we've progressed somewhat in how we view women. You need to catch up.

&gt; Which tells us (along with the fact that alcohol is incorporated into most alleged rape) that most other ""rape"" consists of women going out and having drunken sex with strangers

Let's leave your horrendous set-up for this to one side and just point out that this does not follow from the previous statement. Once again, you're making misogynist assumptions, and once again, you're wrong.

The only striker I'd say Rodgers has zero culpability for is Balotelli, because we know that was a fuckup of the committee's design. Every other striker falls ""in between"", since it'd have needed a joint approval from the committee and Rodgers.

But once the strikers are at the club, Rodgers is fully culpable for how they're used. It's concerning that Rodgers has never considered using Balotelli-Borini or Balotelli-Sterling as a strike partnership; it's concerning that he chose to set up with a lightweight false 9 against a physical Stoke side that use 2 DM's, thus clogging the space you'd expect a false 9 to operate in.

On Origi - I daresay Lille weren't going to sell him to anyone unless they got another year of him on loan; he had time on his contract, after all. Also, the kid was 19; it's not likely that he'd have been our saviour, while it is likely that so much pressure and expectation and scrutiny could've permanently hampered his Liverpool career. 

You and I have talked a lot about Rodgers, and if it comes across as if I'm absolving him of all transfer issues, that may be because I feel like you place all responsibility for transfers 100% on him. The truth is somewhere in between, and it's important because even if we replace him - and I'm starting to warm to that idea after these last 2 performances and the larger trend they're part of - the new manager will still struggle as long as the transfer committee fails to get their shit together.",null,0,null,1432486942,null,0,false,0,crjg8h5,null,t3_373ng3,null,t1_crjg8h5,null,t1_crjfwl4,null,null,null,1433241910,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

null,false,kygrtj,null,null,null,"&gt; No doubt he can play as number 10. But, why do you think he should be playing centrally instead of the wings? 

Because he is more effective and more influential when he is playing centrally for us. Most of his goals/assists this season came from him starting near a central position on the pitch.

&gt; I love seeing him cutting in from the flanks and scoring goals. It has become his signature move.

I have to respectfully disagree. None of that has ever been a signature move of Hazard. Hazards goals never are the same, and he sure doesn't score goals cutting in and shooting often enough to have it be his hallmark. Hazards best abilities are dribbling through players, passing, and just in general creating opportunities and causing havoc. All of this is best utilized near the centers of the pitch, not out wide.

Hazard is a maestro being limited the farther he is away from the center. This has been proven with Belgium, when playing in their formation Hazard is pushed wider than he is with Chelsea, and you can see a clear drop in influence he has on the pitch. And even with Chelsea, he is always aiming to get closer to the middle and often does so. The only reason i believe we are still waiting to put Hazard in the middle is because we haven't had another winger that can be as important for us as Oscar is in the middle. If we got a winger like Greizmann I could see that change happening though.

Sometimes change for the sake of change is a good thing. Just the act of bringing in a new manager is like turning a new page and gives fresh hope to those involves with the club. That is what we need, and unfortunately it has to come at the expense of Rodgers. I will say though that I dislike how Rodgers has been blamed for everything this season, whilst last season is put down to the ""perfect storm"". It's revisionist and hypocritical.

The thing is, it's very important to minimise the number of operations you're putting elderly patients through, particularly when they involve general anaesthesia, where each procedure carries a risk. Were they able to properly clean, disinfect and sterilise the ""rusty hacksaw""? Was the outcome in any way negatively affected by their emergency choice of tool? People need to remember that orthopaedics is carpentry with bones, and yes, brute force is often required. It might well have been the case that stitching things up provisionally and letting the patient wake up only to have to undergo repeat surgery would have been riskier – especially since there may not have been enough attached tissue available at that point (when they hit the undocumented metal plate) to still close the wound. It might well have been a case of remove this bit by any means necessary. Also, it sounds to me as if they used the emergency tool to cut that metal, not to cut bone. 

I agree that it's better to be prepared for all eventualities, but much as you're stocked and trained to expect the unexpected, I think it's frankly not always possible because no system is perfect and humans are not clairvoyant.

Sounds to me as if this only ever hit the headlines because someone boasted of (not entirely unjustified) make-do pride, and then the tall tale got whispered down the lane until it reached a level of embellishment and an amateur audience that got outraged rather than impressed.

If you judge him on transfers that we can be fairly sure were his personal choices, and by the players that we were linked with on, what it appeared as, his say, then he doesn't appear to be effective in the transfer market.

null,false,koptimism,lfc99,,null,"I'm in a similar headspace to Tomkins - until the last two games I'd been arguing that Rodgers deserved another season. Now I'm not so sure. 

&gt; As fans we no longer accept bad or even mediocre seasons, even if coming off the back of an excellent one. **We blame them for everything that goes wrong, when at times they cannot control many of the factors. But then again, we fete them when they do well, and that’s the nature of the sport.**

That bit stood out for me. No matter what happens to Rodgers, there's still many factors beyond the manager that need to be fixed if we're to have any success: 

- We know the committee spots good players, but it doesn't feel as if they're always buying players that fit the manager's requirements (Mignolet and Balotelli the biggest examples) - that needs to change.

- We need to be smarter in transfer dealings/negotiations. The past 3 seasons have seen panic buys, embarrassingly poor attempts at lowballing that have seen us lose out on definite signings, and being played by players' agents/owners that had no intention of their players coming to us. We know that 4 other teams in the country have more money and recent history of success than us, so for us to sign players before they beat us to them, we need to be decisive.

- The youth focus needs to be re-evaluated. The young Gerrard, Carragher and Owen flourished because they came into a team with senior players around them to guide them; now that Gerrard's leaving, this team's woefully short on senior players. If FSG don't want to buy 26-29 year olds, fine; but let's look at 23-25 year olds instead of 20-22 year olds. Build a new core of experienced players, and then go back to the youth focus.",null,0,null,1432488366,null,0,false,0,crjgwpi,null,t3_373u9n,null,t1_crjgwpi,null,t3_373u9n,null,null,null,1433242229,null,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16,null

have a look on gumtree and ebay and see whats around, you can get a decent yamaha ybr, or honda msx/cbfs for about 1.5k

keep in mind the insurance prices, ybr, cbf, msx are all considered commuters as such and lowers the insurance while the r125 and i think the cbr are considered ""super-sports"" and insurance sky rockets. for example, you could be looking at about 700 quid to insure a ybr or similar for the year on fully comp but you may be looking at 1500 for a r125/cbr 125 depending on the postcode lottery, it could be better/worse

To be clear, I think Rodgers should be replaced IF we can bring in someone who'll be an improvement. But there are a lot of other issues:

* **The transfer committee**: it's hard to be sure what's actually happening here, but everyone can recognize it has been a problem. Our transfers have been mostly shit, and some of the worst ones (like Balotelli, how much did we spend for his ONE league goal this season?) seemed to be *against* the manager's wishes. 

* **Our financial position**: regardless of who's running the club, we have a much smaller stadium and are bringing in less money than most (probably all) of our top four rivals. The Anfield expansion is a step in the right direction but probably too little too late. It will be years before the full expansion is complete, and it'll still be smaller than the stadiums City, United, and Arsenal have right now. We won't ever be able to really compete with those clubs on transfers until we can match or beat the wages they can offer (especially since Liverpool is a less attractive destination than London to most players and their families) and we can't do that without improving our finances a lot. Being good and getting CL money would help with that, of course, but United missed CL last year and still managed some massive transfers to their shit city over the summer. How? Part of it is a respected, credentialed manager. But a lot of it is they have lots of money to throw around.

* **Public relations**: jesus fucking christ. Everything from the Sterling drama to the so-shitty-people-think-they're-fake Twitter transfer announcements...there are obvious issues here. You can blame the player drama mess on Brendan if you like, but there are (or at least should be) other people at the club whose job it is to deal with stuff like this, or all the transfer saga and bullshit. 

* **The players themselves**: The lineup was poor, and maybe Rodgers has lost the dressing room. But that was *Steven Fucking Gerrard*'s last game. Even if Rodgers is a terrible motivator, he's their fucking captain and they should have been able to motivate themselves to *at least* a less shit performance than that. Shit, even if Rodgers died and the team was being interim managed by a four-year-old, those players should *still* have been able to manage at least a respectable loss or something.

&gt; In 1999, Fred Barron was considering producing a British sitcom the same way sitcoms were produced in the U.S.. My Family was to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in UK with shows including Goodnight Sweetheart and On the Buses, but was nevertheless atypical. My Family was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters with whom viewers would be able to build a relationship in the same way as previous BBC sitcom 2point4 Children which focuses around a similar family unit.

I agree, but that doesn't necessarily mean the other songs don't suck. I'm not a fan of Eurovision anyway as you can tell, but politics does have a significant impact that does affect outcomes, despite what people say the general populace of Europe does not seem to care and votes based on politics instead. Which is the point regardless of how well the UK or any other country does, which is why pretending politics does not exist within Eurovision is just dismissive when it's the perfect platform that people will hijack to voice their views whether you view that as right or wrong.

We were linked with Silva when he was 23-24. I feel FSG would be happy to buy such players at that age. 

Our strategy has to be always to sign talent 1 year before their breakout season. Like how Rafa wanted Villa, Eto, Silva, Alves etc. For example we were not willing to pay 8 million for Alves and one or two years later he was sold for some 25+ million.

I don't understand how you could dismiss the fact he has scored most of his goals coming from the wings.  With his pace he is more dangerous running at defenders at a full speed and cutting in. Most of us would love to see us sign Greizmann, but it is funny how most of you here think he will have the same impact like Hazard had on the wings. They are totally different players. Greizmann has been at his very best while playing centrally behind a striker, not on the wings. If we were to play him on the wings, don't forget he can also play on both sides(even though, he mostly played on the left when he was at Real Sociedad).

Yes, there was the massive Suarez factor of course but he was still our manager when we played beautiful football without Suarez - that same season. The style of football when it worked was fucking amazing - even neutrals enjoyed watching us. It is a shame people are so quick to forget this. Not to mention pulling off an unbeaten run this year when all the odds were stacked against us.

Rodgers has been dealt a bad deal this season with injuries, working under the constraints of FSG and not getting the players he wanted in. He is an intelligent man and loves LFC. I like him. It is sad see to him going out like this - with assholes flying banners over the stadium, calling him Brenda and getting personal about his tan and teeth etc. He doesn't deserve that - even if he has got things wrong at times - his heart has been in the right place. Those so-called 'fans' can fuck right off. Yes, criticise his tactics but getting personal like that is a disgrace.

Having said all of that - the players seem to have lost faith and Klopp is free. It would be fucking madness not to do everything in the club's power not to grab him. Right now.

It would boost the players, attract new players and give the club a new energy, unite the fans etc. The time is right. The worst that could happen is we sack Rodgers and get somebody shit in. That is the nightmare scenario.

Then I'd def compare/contrast them to what Moffat does with writing/fan alienation.


This part of the presentation, while quite interesting, would work better if cut and done separately. It could easily take an hour plus on its own. It takes the villains’ discussion from “internal” to the show in acting roles to those “external” to the show - politics in show management. It’s also likely to generate a lot of (heated or polarizing) discussion.


If you want to focus on all of the subject areas in your post then you may need to reduce the content by quite a bit – closer to a power point style bullet list. If you want to go into detail you may need to stick with one subject area. In which case you could go with whichever subject area you are most comfortable with / knowledgeable about discussing (and answering questions about).


What do you plan on for a presentation style - lecture, discussion, a mix? What presentation format do you plan to use – discussion only, power point, film clips, or a mix? Will it be only you speaking on the subject, other panelists, or a guest/actor/subject matter expert? How much audience participation do you want? The more people that become involved in giving input the less time there is for your input. Do you want a broad discussion or to lecture on subject specific detail?



I got a bit detailed myself not knowing your past experience. Hopefully there is some useful info for fine tuning your presentation. And I hope to hear you at the DC Awesome Con.

""He took over when we went down to the Championship and he did his job getting us promoted at the 1st attempt. Okay, he did have the biggest budget and needed the playoffs, but he did it and we were happy. The 1st season back in the Prem and we were a 'tough as nails' team, played a lot of Route 1 but it was effective and we finished top 10. Not great to watch but we survived and were happy.
Next season, we expected progression. Instead, it was a chore to watch us play. It was clear that Sam had his favorites and rigidly stuck with them, even when the were playing poorly. We didn't have the best squad but there was an expectation that we would at least try to play football instead of pounding it forward for the big lads to knock it down. Fans got frustrated and the chairmen stuck by Sam, on condition that he played more attacking football this year.
This year started great, we were 4th by Christmas. Sam was playing attacking football, his favorites were injured/benched and we were ready to crown him Queen of Love and Beauty. We ran into a lot of top teams around Christmas and Sam reverted back to his old system and favoured players. Suddenly it became a nightmare to watch West Ham. Kevin Nolan replaced Downing at the tip of the diamond and was diabolical, yet he stayed in the side. We dropped like a stone and Sam came out with 7 games left to say he would be happy to get 5 points of the remaining 21. Show some fucking ambition! We won just 3 games in 2015 all told. He treats the cups like a joke and totally lost the fans confidence. I don't hate the man at all but he took us as far as he was able.
I've also seen people say that we are spoiled and should be happy for being 4th at Christmas etc. We finished 12th. How happy would you be if your horse fell and broke his leg halfway through the race? Would you think ""ah well, he was 4th when he fell at least!""? Of course not. A good start is just that. It is very easy for a Chelsea/Arsenal fan or whoever to think that the likes of West Ham should be happy with 12th but we aren't. We have ambitions like anyone else and expect to see improvement year on year. Thanks Sam for making us a mid-table side but that is about as far as it goes, we need someone with fresh ideas to lead us into the new era in the Olympic Stadium.""",null,0,null,1432492161,null,0,false,0,crjiqbi,null,t3_373xnf,null,t1_crjiqbi,null,t3_373xnf,null,null,null,1433243087,null,12,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,12,null

He has all the tools and strengths to thrive there and has consisently shown us he makes the most things happen the closer he is to the center. I am not sure why you keep telling me he is better out to the side of the field.

&gt; They are totally different players. Greizmann has been at his very best while playing centrally behind a striker, not on the wings.

Griezmann before this season was known as a winger, and did a damn amazing job at it. He played on the left with Real Sociedad and was superb. If anything he will either play on the left or on the right and Willian will play on the other side. 

Griezman - Hazard - Willian: This is an ideal lineup to me. Both sides have pace, and the creativity and explosiveness of Hazard in the center. Using Hazard outwide just because he is pacey is a complete waste of his ability, a lot of wingers are pacey, but Hazard has much more ability and playmaking than that.

It sounds a glib response, but I think that is his approach - control the game in an active way not in a reactive way (ala Benitez). It is also his weakness because he is so busy thinking how to get the ball into creative areas that he forgets to shut the door. It was the problem last season and the problem this. Overloading the team with similar number 10 type players.

Is the defending improving? I actually think we have been a little more solid this season than last and we probably face more defensive situations because we haven't been attacking as much or playing as well as last season. The back three of Sakho Skrtel and Can were doing okay for a while and we thought Rodgers had solved it like you say.

Something I think you can take is that this season has been a failure for Rodgers so it is an opportunity to learn and come back better. I'd really like to hope we could be a club that gives a manager the ability to do that because stability is where sustained success can be built - we can't buy it off the peg as financially the 5th biggest club in the league.

I think all this has been achieved and it has been great to see it happen largely through the integration of young players, so overall I am very happy with Poch's first year.

Looking forward I think we can be optimistic. 5th and a cup final despite Kane, Bentaleb, Mason and Dier playing their first full season as regular starters is excellent in my opinion. As well as those new first teamers I just mentioned, Vertonghen looks like he cares again and the previously much-maligned Rose is now simply awesome.

---

&gt;A __color commentator__ (__color analyst__, __analyst__, __summariser__) is a [sports commentator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportscaster) who assists the [play-by-play announcer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator), often by filling in any time when play is not in progress.   The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action.  The color commentator provides expert [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis) and background information, such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), strategy and injury reports on the [teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team) and [athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson), and occasionally [anecdotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote) or light humor. Color commentators are often former [athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson) or [coaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport\)) of the sport being broadcast.

I've had three faults with my MacBook that retail stores have failed to fix, and a quick email to sjobs@apple.com resolved it everytime. If you've exhausted the more obvious support/complaint routes, its definitely worth a try. 

The short version of each fault (each time I had fairly extended discussions with the store, without the problem being resolved, before contacting sjobs):

* First fault was that chargers kept stopping working - 5+ new chargers/repairs later, and the store was no closer to finding the root cause. Emailed sjobs and didn't get a reply, but did get a call from the store 48 hours later saying a brand new MacBook Pro (I only originally had the discontinued MacBook) was waiting for me to pick up.

* Second fault was a keyboard issue (keys falling off), which was dismissed as accidental damage and would therefore be £200+ plus to repair. Emailed sjobs again, as the machine was less than a year old and I knew it had suffered no damage, and 'Executive Support' contacted me less than 24 hours later and organised a repair for me (They also gave me £80 in store credit to account for a price drop on an iMac that happened about three weeks after I purchased one. I didn't even ask for that)

* Third fault was with the power cable fraying on the charger. I was initially told it would be about £30, so was just going to pay that. I was then told they didn't have any replacements in stock, but could purchase a boxed one for £63 (or book in my laptop for repair, which would mean leaving it at the store until the part arrived). I emailed executive support to see if this was normal, rather than just using a boxed one one or ordering a replacement, and they shipped me one directly free of charge.",null,0,null,1432494394,null,0,false,0,crjjs29,null,t3_370caz,null,t1_crjjs29,null,t1_crj6hcy,null,null,null,1433243581,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I don't know, that's not up to me, but I'm thinking Klopp can attract better players than Rodgers. He's a renowned and a successful manager that many players would love to play for.

&gt; What's the point of getting a replacement that isn't better than the one we currently have?

I don't agree with your assertion that Rodgers is as good as Klopp. I want Rodgers to be successful here, I simply don't see it happening with the way team has been playing, it's slow, toothless, we don't have the same mentality like last season. If Rodgers stays, fine, I'm okay with that, I'm sure he'll get better. If he leaves and Klopp, Benitez or whatever great manager we can get comes in then great, some fresh change. I really don't want Rodgers to leave unless we can get Klopp.

* Factor-in the cost of FULL kit (full face helmet, too) a very good chain (spend between £50 and £100) plus a disc lock to keep with the bike at all times. An alarm wouldn't hurt, either.

Tell her to make the best out of her time there, to enjoy the university and the city she is going to be in, and let her know that it is a very expensive city to live in due to rent and other expenses such as travel and the occasional nights out. As a northerner, you know that everything is cheaper up north. Hell, a Jaeger bomb is £1 in most nights out in the north as opposed to ~£5-£7 in London!!!

However this is probably unlikely to happen. So what does happen if Syria and/or Iraq falls completely to ISIS? What will the world do then? Surely we cannot sit aside and watch it happen.

I've seen what these people do, and the stuff you don't see so much reported in the media is truly sickening. Worst atrocities since the Nazis, and I would say they are comparable in evil. There is no doubt in my mind that they would seek another holocaust if they had the means to accomplish it. These are people who can not be reasoned with, bargained with or brought into negotiations. They need to be destroyed for the sake of humanity, and (as sad as it is to say this) if that involves bombing UNESCO world heritage sites, then so be it. I think it is impossible to justify to the parents of a dead soldier that he had to go in on foot without air cover because the battleground happened to be an ancient city.

I think ISIS is going to be Obama's Rwanda. I really wish he would do what, he surely knows to be morally right, and do more about this situation.

That is passing the ball and spotting the runs of other players from miles away. And what is Hazard best ability? His biggest ability is going past defenders. How can you just dismiss the importance of his pace? Btw, how did you came to a conclusion that Hazard drifting into the central area means he is most influential in that position or that he loves playing centrally? He is not the 1st winger to do so. Lots of other modern wingers drift to the central area. These days only the traditional wingers hug the touchlines(players like Valencia, Ashley Young etc). With all his abilities, we still haven't seen Hazard passing the ball like Mata or Silva. I think playing on the wings is what is giving him the freedom to make those runs in the central area when no one expect them. If he were to stood still in the central area, he would have been man marked mostly. And when he makes his usual runs in tight spaces, he would get fouled most of the time. Why on earth are you trying to box him one position just to accommodate other players? You don't even need to watch some of his highlights to know the importance of what he does on the flanks. He is more like Ronaldo than the Silva of this world you are trying to make him. He is the best winger in the world at the moment. But, he is not the best playmaker. And for Griezmann, he has elevated his game to the next level. I bet you weren't this crazy about him last season, why all over sudden do you think he can play like Hazard on the wings? Hazard is most likely the 3rd best player in the world, it is plain stupid to even think a player like Griezmann can have the same impact he has on the wings. EPL is totally different from La Liga, only handful of players have made that transition smoothly.

Understand your points and I can see why people are losing their shit. 6th place is never good enough for Liverpool FC.

For me our 3 best players from last season were Suarez, Sturridge
and Gerrard. We lost Suarez and Sturridge and because of that Gerrard couldn't operate as a quarterback anymore, so effectively we lost his best assets as well. If you take the best three players out of City: Aguero, Toure and Silva, they probably would of finished similarly to us.

Last 5 years we've finished 7th, 8th, 6th, 7th and 2nd. If you take away last year this season isn't an anomaly. In those seasons we had players like Mascherano, Torres, Suarez, Gerrard (with more legs), Meireles, Glen Johnson (when he was an ok football player), Reina and Carragher all roughly around their peaks and we still finished the same or worse than this season. Also for the early seasons City weren't the force they are today. 

This year we've had zero strikers who suit the way we play and a shit-load of kids with good potential. I can't think of anyone in the squad who is at their peak apart form Skrtel and maybe Lallana who's never got going because of injuries.

The recruitment strategy was to bring the wage bill down and increase the squad with talented youngsters. Not bringing in a big name striker who fitted our system was criminal but who was available? (Sanchez is a wing forward/number 10 and his wife wasn't interested). 

Given the squad this year and the injuries, Rodgers has got the best out of a bad situation. I don't believe Rafa, Klopp or anyone else wouldn't of gotten us higher than 5th this season given the squad available. If we sack Rodgers he'll be at City next season, I don't want to see that.

All I think is he deserves another season, he almost delivered the best season for a quarter of a century last year, it wasn't all Suarez. He had players like Jon Flanagan and Sterling playing out of their skin.

This is only **my opinion** and I doubt anyone will read it anyway.

null,false,istillfeelyou,rangers,,null,"THE WORLD'S football's ruling body has entered the heated debate over Rangers' status after liquidation by promoting an article indicating it is not a new club.

Promotional material from FIFA ( Federation Internationale de Football Association) headquarters to promote the content of its weekly magazine, states: ""After their enforced relegation in 2012, Glasgow Rangers are in the hunt for promotion back to Scotland's top flight.""

It later emerged the comment promoted an 'On The Inside' article headlined  'Rangers eye top-flight return' written by Swiss writer Peter Eggenberger.

It states: "" In spring 2012, Rangers were placed into liquidation and relegated to the fourth tier of Scottish football. The 54-time champions overcame another obstacle on the long road back to the Premier League last weekend but, after winning two successive promotions in style, that final leap is proving a little more difficult.

A group of Celtic fans caused controversy when they paid for an advert in a newspaper saying Rangers are a new club.

The advert was a lengthy statement which claims Rangers became a new club following liquidation in 2012.

Those Celtic fans who feel Rangers are a new club, have objected to any commentary that indicates that if successful in the Scottish Championship play-offs, that they will ""return"" to the top flight.

Rangers Football Club plc, the former operating company, went into administration in February, 2012, after a £9 million PAYE and VAT debt was amassed to the taxman under Craig Whyte's leadership. The oldco renamed RFC 2012 plc is now being liquidated.

The Celtic fans ad said the term The Old Firm was now redundant ""following the liquidation of Rangers (1872)"" and stated the new club came into being in 2012.

Many diehards will only refer to Rangers as Sevco, the name given to the Charles Green-headed consortium that bought the liquidated assets with a £5.5 million loan in 2012.

In December SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster insisted Rangers are the same club which existed before liquidation.

He said: ""In terms of the question about old club, new club, that was settled very much by the Lord Nimmo Smith commission that was put together by the SPL to look at EBT payments at that time.

""The decision, very clearly from the commission, was that the club is the same, the club continues, albeit it is owned by a new company, but the club is the same.

""It's the same club, absolutely.

""The member club is the entity that participates in our league and we have 42 member clubs.""

That commission's decision referred to ""the board of directors of Oldco as a company, as distinct from the football management or players of Rangers FC as a club...""

The Advertising Standards Authority in December, 2013, in considering challenges to Rangers' claims as ""Scotland's most successful club"", supported the view that continuity of history continued.

It has emerged that UEFA confirmed to the ASA that its rules allowed for the recognition of the ""sporting continuity"" of a club's match record, even if that club's corporate structure had changed.

The European Club Association, the sole independent body recognised by UEFA and FIFA as representing clubs at European level confirmed Rangers remain as members of the organisation in December, 2012 after the transfer of ownership.

In June, 2012, Lord Glennie in considering a decision to uphold a transfer embargo on Rangers referred to ""Rangers Football Club plc, a company presently in administration.. .that presently operates Rangers Football Club.""",null,0,null,1432495591,null,0,false,0,crjkclb,null,t3_3735fz,null,t1_crjkclb,null,t3_3735fz,null,null,null,1433243849,null,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

Another good option is Warrender Park Crescent, where quite a few of my friends lived. It's the other side of the meadows, so still quite central, whilst being closer to Kings. Nice flats too, and a great atmosphere.

As you alluded to, Rafa had the rug pulled from his feet in his final season, he had no money for players, Purslow was shadowing him everywhere (training, half time talks, everywhere). They made his life untenable, managed out of the club internally by by virtue of a constructive dismissal and externally using negative PR tactics. He became a pain in the ass for H&amp;G and in doing so, he helped save our club. Our results suffered through this civil war, but we are indebted to him forever.

I’m honestly of two minds about this season and really don’t know how to feel overall. I mean, a part of me wants to say that the team has improved overall, and a lot of that comes down to Rodgers. I mean, we’ve had a bad year, no doubt, but I sincerely feel that with the exception of the last quarter of the year, we were fighting through the rough patches and still had the drive that we needed to get results. This was encouraging, as I really think that we could have slipped further down the table than we did.

On the other hand, it feels pretty clear that a large swath of the team has lost their confidence in their manager over the past few months, and that really speaks poorly of Rodgers. In terms of the Rodgers Out movement, I found myself firmly on the fence for most of the season, leaning a bit towards saying he should stay. Honestly, this last game kind of swayed me in the opposite direction though; the team seemed lethargic and uninterested (with the obvious exceptions), and bizarre selection choices (Can at RB? Couldn’t give Johnson a nice last match in a Liverpool shirt?) really have made me doubt that even Rodgers gives a shit at this point. This coupled with the handling of the Sterling situation, and I do have to say that I have my doubts.

The entire team is going to be in a major period of transition. Stevie’s gone, Johnson’s gone, and (to my chagrin), Lucas is likely gone. Add to that, we’re likely selling off three of our four strikers (although I kind of wish Balotelli would get another go; I think he’s just had a bad year…but I totally understand selling him off, too). To go with another manager right now feels like it would be too drastic of an overhaul, but at the same time, it might be the best time. If we could actually attract Klopp or Rafa back, I’d sign on wholeheartedly, but I honestly don’t think either man comes to Anfield any time soon. I don’t know if anyone else we could attract would be a significant enough improvement over Rodgers.

This summer will be crucial for us; we need to find one, preferably two strikers who can start every week. We need to get a RB of first-team quality, and we need to get a goalkeeper who can challenge Mignolet for his starting spot. Most importantly, though, we need to see whatever manager we have at the end of August really take the reins and command the respect and confidence of the locker room.",null,0,null,1432496981,null,0,false,0,crjl06q,null,t3_373ndn,null,t1_crjl06q,null,t3_373ndn,null,null,null,1433244158,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

The argument that we shouldn't prosecute criminals for fear of deterring victims is as logical as saying we shouldn't prosecute anyone for anything for fear of false convictions. Right now someone who reports a rape has to be ready to face their attacker in court and have their testimony called in to question by the defence counsel. Saying that if a court found - beyond reasonable doubt - that the allegations were made up, they would face conviction, isn't much of a stretch.

The implication that our policy should be to never prosecute criminals who attempt to pervert the course of justice not only removes all protection under law for those victims of those criminals, but removes any ability they may ever have to seek justice.

It all depends on if there is literally 10x the number of renters than rental properties, or if each renter talks to ten agents meaning a 1x multiplier in practice.  And given that the majority of property purchases seem to be ""investments"", the number of properties to rent is growing quite steadily.

The market will move, of course, as things change; if London keeps being the only part of London with jobs then rental prices will go up.  But it's not going to ever mirror the for-sale market, there are different forces at work.  In the for-sale market, as prices rise, less people put their homes up for sale, which accelerates the growth; in the rental market they'll still be listed, no-one's going to say ""well I'll leave it empty for a year, then it'll fetch more next time.""  This is the liquidity benefit of short-term contracts, it makes the pricing much more efficient.

If anything, the only thing that is likely to cause a massive rental-price spike would be buy-to-let going out-of-fashion.  If you had speculators cashing in and leaving, then you'd see a sudden reduction in properties to rent, that would get nasty very quickly.  But then what could make that happen, may be increased opportunities in the rest of Europe, who knows?

He's always dropped quite a bit more silly points against weaker opposition than you'd expect at every club he's gone to and in the Premier League now you really can't slip up at all against the smaller sides.

Klopp is a very good manager, but he is not at Rafa's level, not anywhere near it. I have serious doubts as to whether his geggenpressing would work in this league against the bottom half of the league. This style of play has been counterproductive for him in recent years, as teams learned to park the bus and let Dortmund have the ball. Klopps game is all about pressing and playing in the transitions, he's not a posession based manager. He will unite this squad like never seen before, but he will find it tough getting the points from the lesser teams. Then there's Coutinho &amp; Lalanna who don't have the stamina, and Lucas, Sturridge who don't have the fitness for his game. 

I do like Klopp and think he could be successful here, but he's a risk as a Klopp having to change his principles of play, is not the Klopp we know. Plus, he's had a pretty miserable season too.

Whatever your opinion on the matter 300k net migration to this country a year is not sustainable. 

It is clear that A) the benefits are not being shared across the country, those who are in areas of high migration have seen wage suppressed and communities change irrevocably B) when you forecast that only 20k immigrants would come but the reality was over 500k then there is no way we could've had the infrastructure in place to handle them, which means pressures on housing, health and other services.

People make the argument that there are as many UK citizens in Europe as there are European citizens moved to the UK, that may be the case, but I imagine that the level of unskilled labour migration is not equal. I very much doubt young british men and women are going to Poland or the Czech Republic to be builders, plumbers, waitresses or careworkers. I imagine a good portion of the migration from the UK to the EU is retirees, people going to live with family/partners and skilled professionals.

Yes, migrants contribute to the exchequer, but so do hedge funds and investment banks, I don't think those who claim we should have unlimited immigration would argue that we should allow banks and hedge funds to act without regulation, in unlimited numbers. So why can we not have some regulation in place for immigrants, to ensure that people come here for the right reasons and not the wrong ones?

All the boats that are protected off the horn of Africa are getting a state subsidy. A subsidy we would all agree with but still a subsidy to achieve the goals of the state - global trade and economic growth. It is a subsidy because the tax payer is paying to protect the boats not private militia paid directly by the companies. Then the subsidy is larger for the boats that have a higher value (as they are more threatened by piracy) - most probably massive oil tankers have a higher value cargo.

null,false,lobbmaster,null,null,null,"One of my biggest problems this season is that we stopped our attacking football. It was okey between December 15th and start of February but other than that we have been one of the worst teams in the league in terms of creating proper chances.

Big chances created is defined as chances that you expect goals from and these numbers are from OPTA:

* Despite our good play from December to February, overall we are ranked 14th in the league for big chances created. We created 50 big chances, Arsenal created the most with 91. Only Newcastle, West Brom, Burnley, Sunderland, Hull and Aston Villa created fewer.

* We are ranked around 4th on average for total shots, shots on target, minutes per chance etc - so we are getting to many small chances or taking long shots, but we are ranked 7th for shots inside the box, which also shows we are struggling more to get to good goal chances compared to other top teams.

* Our set-pieces have been awful, ranked 14th for goals scored.

You can partly blame that on our strikers (or lack of strikers in starting 11), but I think the problem is more down to the general philosophy Rodgers has adapted for most of the season. We've focused on possession at our own half, veery slow transitions when we get the ball and almost never counterattacking anymore. 

In the first months of the season, and I believe still(?) we NEVER had anyone outside the box on corners.. we didn't have ONE player ready for counter-attack when the opposition had corners. This may be a small detail but I thought it was a very clear sign of this being a managerial decision and not a problem with the players.

Sorry this became a lot longe than expected.. could write about players out of positions etc also but better to keep it statistically in this thread I guess. Good writeup by the way!

The worst-case scenario is an interesting thought experiment though.  (Worst = from the perspective of an actual human, it's the best-case scenario from the perspective of an estate agent.)

The lack of speculation in renting (people are paying to put a roof over their head, people don't rent as a bet on future rent-prices obviously) puts a hard[1]-limit on rental prices - the earnings those who rent them - the ceiling will be linked to earnings (with different subsets of the market linked to different earning brackets).  So (warning, back-of-an-envelope calculations ahead), if the median salary of London is £35,000, that would put a practical limit of £1,500 per month (or £1,500 per month, per person for house shares etc.).  There are many areas of London that are at that level already.

To break through that level, we'd have a city where essentially all it's workers commute from outside (there's nowhere near enough capacity for that); and where it's upper-income earners are all happy to rent to take up the slack, which doesn't seem likely.

Or, the unthinkable, people get healthy payrises that actually match the cost-of-living.  Ha ha ha, yeah, I know.  Or the rental market will obsolete itself, then what happens to the rental properties?  Obviously we'd never get to the stage of 3 million empty rental dwellings, that's not how supply-and-demand works, hence the effective-limit.

So what would really happen?  If the entire world borrows all the money it can, throws it into the London housing market, then we'd see increasing density rather than rental prices.  But again there are limits (apart from corrupt local authorities that don't use their statutory powers against sub-standard housing).

Ultimately, if these ""limits"" could be breached, this would damage the London economy, it would end-up with nothing but millionaires and a massive service-population which is made-up of 22-25 year-old Eastern Europeans putting up with it for the lifestyle.  It would end up with London as one gigantic Monaco full of the rest-of-the-world's tax exiles.

But this isn't likely either, ultimately, despite all the talk of housing shortages, London is too big for the whole region to be entirely consumed by the worlds wealth.  A breaking-point would be reached before things get that far.  Something that would damage the UK economy to the extent that it wouldn't be a safe-haven for wealth.  Something like voting to leave the EU in the forthcoming referendum and thereby stopping the free-flow of skilled Eastern Europeans doing high-value work in Central London for £35,000 (although I'm sure the Tories will dream-up some way of keeping that get-out-of-jail card going either way).

TL;DR - none of these extrapolation-based predictions of the future of the economy generally and the housing market in particular ring true; there are blocks, complications and consequences.  It's also worth pointing out that these extrapolations have a very bad track-record, as much as certain commentators like to position themselves as authority figures, they usually sit on the fence and only say the vaguest of predictions ""prices will rise either in the short term, or long-term, either in real or nominal terms"" - it's the economic equivalent of saying ""the sun will rise in the east"" and then claiming to be an expert on the weather - it's true enough statement, but it doesn't explain anything.",null,0,null,1432500759,null,0,false,0,crjmsck,null,t3_372wdp,null,t1_crjmsck,null,t1_crjljpo,null,null,null,1433244998,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Farage made a commitment to resign his leadership if he were unable to secure a seat in the house of commons. He honoured that commitment only to unhonour it a few moments later. 

There has been much disquiet in the party about the matter and has resulted in a very public fall out amongst its senior members.

My point is that the systemic racism is by design only historically. Racism in the legal system - along with most cases of sexism etc - are gone or on the way out. Our contributions towards the design of society now are mostly inclusive. The exception being maybe social design which he touched on with the Kate Hopkins point. But he said they are ""allowing her"" to write this. I wouldn't want the government to stop her saying awful things. The more repulsive the things she says are the more protected she should be.


&gt;Also the justification for empire was at times explicitly racist, even if Akala's play on the word ""great"" is a bit tenuous.

**When buying kit;** 

* Helmet - Full face / flip front
* Gloves - With armour
* Jacket - With CE certified elbow and shoulder pads
* Trousers - With CE certified knee pads
* Boots - Must cover the ankle


[Box do good, cheap helmets for about £50](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=box+bx1+helmet&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Abox+bx1+helmet) which are fine for a starter helmet. Always go for full face or flip-front (but spend at least £150+ on those to get a good one).

----

NEVER EVER buy second hand helmets.

----

[Ixon](http://www.ixon.com/public/) are a great budget (or low mid-range) option for clothing. They sit nicely between Oxford and Alpinestars. I have a few Ixon items and they're surprisingly good for the money.

**As for a chain:** Yes. You need to secure your bike. You'd be surprised at how easy a light 125 is to steal. I've had friends with 1000cc sports bikes park them jammed behind cars and thieves just lifted it over.

If it's chained to something immovable like a metal drain pipe, ground anchor or whatever, it'll take time to get it out, and they'll have to make a lot of noise doing it.

----
Theft prevention is largely about dissuading opportunists. A seasoned thief will look for easier targets. Don't make it easy.

----

**As for brand/recommendations:**

A Thatcham approved chain will do the trick for the most part. Try the [Oxford HD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MOTORCYCLE-MOTORBIKE-SECURITY-INSURANCE-APPROVED/dp/B00OK8ELU8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432501593&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=oxford+hd+chain). At less than £40, it's a good deal, too.

As i mentioned; Get a disc lock. Maybe one with a built in alarm.

Also think about getting a reasonable cover for the bike. Make sure it's a dark colour and NOT reflective. Making the bike less visible to an opportunist with a torch will help.

Get an alarm on the bike. Datatool do one for just under £100 and it's self-fit.

Don't ever just leave the bike 'for a couple of minutes' or with just the steering lock on. Those are easy to break. Disclock every time.

Basically, I want the UK to leave, for autonomy and sovereignty for the long term.

&gt; To preserve the long-term sovereignty of the UK, so that decisions which affect people here are made only here, with as little as possible influence from people who live somewhere else on the planet. In other words, [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) and autonomy.

&gt; I recognise that, so far, the EU has done far more good than bad and trade with other EU states is important. I also recognise that the UK has had plenty of opt-outs so far and has a huge influence. But if we are heading the way of federalism in 50 years or so, I see a reduction in state rights and people power coming, if America's trend of continuing power grabs by central government is to be believed. I do not think our opt-out will last forever, or even 50 years. In other words, I am not against the EU's net effects so far (even immigration), I am just against the concept constitutionally. I think the UK should remain separate as long as there is a major EU-Federalist element in the EU, because it is a threat to self-rule.

&gt; These outweigh any short term downsides, in my opinion.

&gt;* I think he has a clean licence, but he's only had a UK licence for a couple of years. He's about 40. Does that still put him in the 6-point bracket, or 12-point?

&gt;* From what I've read, they seem to give out a ban of at least a year - is that correct?

&gt;* Any recommendations for solicitors in the London area?

Hi, cop here.

To answer your questions:

* The legal limit is 35mg/100ml breath. 60 is *almost* double. Police only charge if the result is over 40 mg. 

* You get given a choice whether you want to do a blood/ urine sample if its under 50 IIRC.

* He will receive a mandatory 12 month ban unless there are special conditions which he may ask for in court and receive e.g. 11 points or a shorter ban. These may include work etc. however they are not always taken into account.

* Yeah what I said above, basically.

* No not really. Google it maybe.

You didn't explain how Rodgers, who had a plan and wouldn't do a Tottenham, could spend £100m and get 22 fewer points this season.

&gt; There is no concrete reason why 73 points was not achievable this season.

There's no concrete reason why thinking 1) Tim would've got 72 points last year in a full season (extrapolating from a little over half a season) and 2) Tim would've got 72 points this season based on that hypothetical season last year.

This season, after 17 games West Ham had 31 points. That means they'd get 69 points in total this season. #thatshowthisworksright",null,0,null,1432502912,null,0,false,0,crjnti2,null,t3_373rnb,null,t1_crjnti2,null,t1_crjnm87,null,null,null,1433245556,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Keeper: Szczesny on loan for a year would be alright, we've also been linked with Molde's keeper Nyland. Begovic is leaving Stoke but has said he'd only go to a club where he'd start so may be an issue when Forster comes back.

CM: I think we should sign Vilhena anyway, as we never replaced Cork. Then go in for Clasie if Morgan goes. We have to remember we also have Reed coming through in this position.

CB: Obviously I want us to keep Toby but if not then Van Dijk and Kongolo are the two obvious targets. I think one of Stephens and/or Turnbull could make the step up next year.

If you are in uni off then anywhere in town is where you will be wanting to stay the problem is most house/flat shares are located in the smithdown area.

So you really have 3 options:

1: Stay in the uni of dorms 
2: Pick any dorms located around the city center 
3: House share in smithdown area. 

The best advice i can give you is in dorms you will be on campus and meet a lot of new people but they will be expencive.

In any city center dorms they will be close to your campus and you will meet a lot of new people but they are also expencive.

In the smithdown area it is a lot cheaper and it will be difficult to find a house share (Most people move out to shared houses with their previous roommates in university dorms) and the area is not very nice either.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"I'll start with my wish list:  

Striker! Would like: Austin, Ings, Mitrovic (though I've heard he's got a bit of an attitude?). 

Expect: 27 Year old target man similar to Pellé that doesn't really give us an alternative option so much as another version of the same option. Maybe a bit more usage of Gallagher and maybe Seager too though, which would be nice.    

Also would like to see Osvaldo shipped out permanently just so he can be 100% officially gone, having to consider him every window is frustrating, and makes us a bit of a joke too!  

Midfield - Would like: Sign Djuricic; I think he's the type of creative player we need and getting one equal to him and his potential would cost us as much as he did anyway (see: Ramirez). Velhena for a future midfield engine. Clasie for Schneiderlin replacement who I expect to leave. We have enough wingers but I expect us to sign Elia anyway, think we should use some of our youths like McQueen or Hesketh more too, so don't really want to see any more winger/wide striker type signings - Mané, Djuricic, Tadic, Rodriguez, Elia and Long are all enough (though a few could be good in a play off the striker position, so we'll see).  

Expect: About the above actually. Obviously don't know for sure if we'll get Vilhena and/or Clasie or some other, but at least one of them seems likely. Although we didn't see a lot of him in his loan spell with us I've liked what little I have seen of Djuricic and think we might sign him too. Elia I think will be a squad player, if he found his form again next season then great, if not then oh well, we'll get him on the cheap.  

Defence: Would like: I assume Clyne is off, though there's always that slight chance, but I'd like to keep the RB English, purely because we've been doing well with our English full backs recently and obviously know how to get the best out of them. Because of that I'd want either Byram or Trippier, though they'll probably be at a premium and we might go to Europe (heard links of the odd French one). I'd like Alderweireld to stay (obviously) and for us to get Van Dijk. I'd like both because Fonte, while awesome, is getting on a bit, Yoshida is good, Gardos is a mystery, but I'd like to see us be able to play 3 - 5 - 2 a bit more, and another quality CB is part of that. Other than that I'm happy for youth to provide cover, McCarthy RB if necessary, even Mugabi to play there.  

Expect: Not a clue. Not a clue about Alderweireld. Not a clue about an RB. Not a clue about a new CB. Not. A. Clue. Koeman will pull off a great defence whatever happens, whoever he gets.  

GK: We need cover for Forster, and while Gazzaniga may be less of a liability than before, it's hard to tell with only 2 games if he'll still flap at cross or not be brave enough to come out and claim something properly. Cech would be nice but I don't know he'd want to come a) to Saints and b) to Saints to be dropped when Forster comes back, and in the absence of that I don't know, maybe that young Newcastle keeper to start with but he's only 19. Don't really want any of the ones we've been linked with, they're mostly already PL 2nd keepers at best. Basically no clue again.  

Expect: No clue.  

Exits: Schneiderlin (Arsenal or CL French/other European team), Clyne (United), Mayuka (Back to France), Osvaldo ^^((please)), Ramirez (back to Italy), Hooiveld (some Championship team, or back to Europe somewhere). There's not as many listed as last season because we don't have as many players left over from League 1 (basically none) or Championship seasons, or even many that we don't want from our first PL summer.  

I think I would basically want to see 1 Striker, 2 midfielders, and 1 defender *added* to the team this summer (not including the ones we have on loan), mainly a main striker, another CM/DM type player, and another CM/AM/Wide midfielder, and another CB, but part of that is just for my want to play a slightly different formation. I imagine we may get 2 or 3 players in that vein of ""added"", the possible keeper cover, and Clyne &amp; Schneiderlin replacements, bringing the total of players in to about 5 I guess? It's hard to say, we always know we have our youth but never know how much to trust them.

Hazard was ridiculously good today, everything he did he seemed to pull of with ease and utter confidence. His acceleration is staggering. Pulled of some nice passes. Almost everything good went through Hazard. Even when he didn't have the ball he was dragging defenders out of position a la Messi

Remy was very good as per usual. Could have scored a couple more goals if he was a bit more lethal. There one was one particular situation in mind when he got the ball from a Willian cut back and instead of just powering it into the net like Costa would have done, he kind of went for a half-hearted shot and didn't follow through. Decided to give him 2 in the end beacuse he did score 2 goals and was excellent driving with the ball at his feet. Linked upp well with others and pulled off some nice dribbles too. Mourinho needs to retain him in the sumer transfer window, he's a brilliant player that can play on the wings and upfront and if Costa is out there won't be a very big drop in wuality upfront at all.

Willian was as briliant as he's been since the turn of the year. Really excelled in the nuber 10 role, gave him the freedom to roam and really show his creativity and fair. Pulled off some audacisou passes, got into good shooting positions, used the ball well held onto very well, brought others into play and made some terrific diagonal balls into players.

We lost one of the best players in the world, replaced him with garbage, just lost our biggest attraction (Gerrard) and are about to lose our biggest young star. 

We don't have the power to call up people like Reus and ask them if they'd like to play for us and that has been a fact for about 5 years. What is out there for us to get without bigger clubs getting in our way?

Name me one player that actually signed for us instead of a bigger club since Benitez was here, and even then we barely got stars. We rather made players stars and then lost them to bigger clubs. Most of you will say Suarez but was there any competition for him at the time? He was serving a ban for biting and it was in january. I don't know.

This summer is make or break for the future of this club. If we don't sign GOOD players, we are officially a mid-table club. Look at our roster and tell me; what world class player would actually want to play here? 

I am just sad. It's so sad how much this club has sunk in the last 10 years. From European Champions to laughing stock in less than a decade. We're such a laughing stock, Adidas sacked us. Who else can say that?

But knowing Liverpool FC in modern times, we will sign Benteke for 30 million and get Ings and Milner on a free.

Sorry for the long rant but I've just had enough. I've felt like this for a long time and this isn't just today's result talking. I didn't even watch the game because as soon as I saw our lineup, I knew we would lose in a disgraceful performance.

It's more worrying to see Sherwood intentionally leave out some players - Cissokho, Lowton, Kinsella - (who are possibly not in his personal favour) to play a ridiculous choice instead to avoid them - N'Zogbia at left back. In the /r/soccer threads about us appointing Tim this is exactly what Spurs fans talked about - completely removing some players out of the squad and making questionable choices instead.

We would probably go down if Lambert stayed in, so credit to Tim for saving our season and possibly going out with a bang. But some of the tactical choices he made, and the personal ones on the top of that, leave some of us worried for the season to come.

It's really hard to watch some players completely sidelined and watch the team struggle. And to me personally I don't like this from team atmosphere point of view either.

Exactly the same thing is going to happen, we're never going to get out of this cycle unless we give a manager five years  minimum to bring through the young players and use them close to their prime. 

I'm as worried as you are about the club, but if we change it all again we're going to be worse off than we are right now.

Counter-attacking? Sure, there's loads of space for players like Coutinho to thread balls through. But when we're slow to attack then it gives the opposition defence time to organise and get behind the ball. We have no width, so we're forced to try and play it straight through a packed defence, which is basically impossible unless you've got a striker making killer movements inside the box (i.e. not Balotelli, not Borini, and not winger-turned-striker Sterling). Part of the reason Ibe looked so handy for us was he would at least try and run through the defence rather than feebly pass it into their centre-back. 

Last year when teams could get behind the ball we had Suarez to conjure up some magic and find a way through. This year we don't have him, and it's exposing just how poor the rest of our squad is at cracking open defences.

That position would not just be one of economic disadvantage but also less political power, less representation in government, in key institutions etc. which is of course also tied in closely with economic power.

   No cup titles in the first three years. Who's to blame?

I think over the last season Rodgers has been found out in a lot of ways, in particular the last two months have been abysmal. That said, I think lack of trophies is something he gets unfairly hammered over. We're unlikely to win the league, we're unlikely to win in Europe, which basically gives us two trophies to aim for each year, competing against realistically four or five other clubs for them. Yeah some finals would be nice, but we're far from the only top side to not see any cup finals in the last couple of years. 

We didn't win a trophy this year and going out of the FA Cup to Villa was massively disappointing, but at the same time we still got to the semi-finals in both cups, which is the best aggregate performance from any club this season across the two competitions. Arsenal and Man Utd went out early in the League Cup, Chelsea did in the FA Cup and Man City went out early in both.

You know it was those reasons, 100%? Nothing else?

&gt;I've listed the reasons.

No good reasons. All you've said is ""ppg = total therefore would've happened this season"". That's not a good reason. 

If Spurs played as well as in the Arsenal and Chelsea wins, that would've been an average of 3.5 goals scored/game, with 114 points total.

Working out:

5+2 = 7/2 = 3.5, 6 points from 2 games = 3points/game, 1 season = 38 games, 38x3 = 114. 

So tell me a good reason why Sherwood *would definitely have gotten 72 points last season if he were in charge for 38 games* and *why Sherwood would've gotten 72 points this year.*

so four signings.  
  
first, we need a defender. maybe two. profile would be a solid defender with some experience who's not too expensive. so it's not going to be a partner who teams up with stones when jags gets too old... it's gonna be something proven. bummer, because i would have loved to see roberto get dragovic of kiev. but i think he has too much ambition to join everton. with kiev he plays cl and competes for the championship... he is basically in a good spotlight to get noticed by the good teams.  so - somebody like vlaar? maybe vermaelen if we are lucky?
  
i am pretty sure the second priority has to be some other younger center back who's not going to see very much play time. van dijk would fit this role but it would be a waste if he was the fourth in the squad when next season it's not like we need 4 with no european competition.  
  
then we need two wingers. preferrably one who can be a playmaker of some sorts like pienaar in his good days. i am happy to see atsu go but we might keep lennon, so lennon would be number 3 on a permanent deal. the fourth one could be someone like deulofeu.  
  
personally, i think that roberto should go for another striker as the last addition to the squad. i know he rates kone but i think he is well past his ""prime"" (if he ever was in his prime). that sounds horrible but home many goals has he scored for us? i know that's not all... but isn't that what a striker should be doing? i think we should go for gignac but i don't think he wants to be the guy on the bench.",null,0,null,1432505236,null,0,false,0,crjoxua,null,t3_36vykq,null,t1_crjoxua,null,t3_36vykq,null,null,null,1433246084,null,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2,null

Appreciate what he's done for us, but he's a bit of a tart, and won't be remembered the way he should be - if he'd had a different attitude.

Fairly common for him to leave the pitch, when being substituted, to rapturous applause, people singing his name, only for him to sulk his way to the bench and not even acknowledge the crowd.

We've supported him through some utterly woeful performances, sang his name when he was playing poorly, he's never recognised that.

He's always had a sense of entitlement, and a impression that he's hard done by.

To see him at a distance from the front of the squad as they walked around the ground acknowledging the fans with applause and waves, sulking, head down, not even looking at the crowd. Pathetic.

He barely looked up once, and it seemed to be pointed.

Mard arse bell-waft.

That is Edin Dzeko. Very high opinion of himself, no appreciation for the fans or the club.

If this is to be your last season at the club, acknowledge the fans, exchange an applause, and move on with a handshake and well wishes.

Instead it's poor old hard done by Dzeko.

And he has such an inflated opinion of himself because of clowns like the OP who hero worship him simply because they share a nationality.

Be delighted to see the back of him if not least to see the end of the Bosnian hordes calling themselves blues and slagging off the club and manager when he doesn't play 'enough' minutes. Because of course he's entitled to play.

Even recall posts on a forum where they were gutted, and angry, that Tevez had scored when Dzeko was on the periphery.

There isn't much difference between the squad of 2005 and the squad of 2014/15, yet 4th is an expectancy for us now even though we were an established top 4 team back then... A new manager taking over a top 4 side would be expected to finish in the top 4. Let's not pretend otherwise and let's take off the rose tinted glasses... Rafa did phenomenal things with that squad and winning the CL was the best icing on the cake we could ever have. However let's not pretend the 5th place finish was entirely down to his determination to win the CL.

in 2009/10 his days were numbered as soon as he openly criticized the owners and fell out with them. He still had prime Torres (albeit injured for a bit), Mascherano and Gerard though, so let's not pretend an enormous budget was needed to progress from the 2nd place finish the year before, Alonso was the only big loss that year. Rafa still had an absolutely fantastic team and we should have finished higher than 7th.

Really do need another striking option, I mean looking at it we have JRod who we usually play wings, Long who is wings unless Pelle is off, Mane apparently is a striker but play him on the wings. What we need is just a fucking top man striker who isnt getting his pension. So, I think out if those we have been linked with and/or available, I'd like to think we have a very good chance at Austin, it's between us and Palace at the moment I believe, so I'd like to think the choice is obvious but who knows. Benteke could be an option, I dont know why a lot of people think he will stay at Villa when he can do so much better but who knows.

Like to get Clasie 100%, Schneiderlin is as good as gone, so pick up Vilhena too, giving us Wanyama/Clasie/Reed/Vilhena, so we don't have to put S. Davis or JWP there.

I'd say we are fairly good on wingers, I'd like to take Djuricic back on a loan with an option to buy. Not interested in Elia, hasnt done enough for me. Probably look at getting another impact winger, depending on who we sign, as we have looked a bit weak in impact subs from that department this season, maybe the addition of JRod and another striker would change that alone.

Think we need to pay a bit for Toby but it would be really worth it, we'll have a lot of competition, but i think he is keen to stay so fingers crossed. Think thats all we need really. We would start Toby and Fonte. Yoshida is a great back up and Gardos is capable given the chance, after that we have a lot of good youth CBs in McCarthy, Stephens and Turnbull.

Still a little hopeful Clyne will sign, and I'm sure we will find out in the coming days, but if he goes, I'd like to make another punt for Byram, over Trippier, we have tried for Byram before so I trust our judgement, and Trippier hasnt overly impressed me.

As for Keepers, its a hard position, we need someone who is good enough to challenge for Europa, but who wont mind being 2nd to Forster in a year, or fighting for his spot over him. There aren't really any keepers below us that really fit that bill at the moment, however, Begovic is touted to leave, and is a pretty decent keeper, so we could maybe take him on a 1 or 2 year deal. Howard could be a possibility, he has had a bad season, but he isnt a terrible keeper, and is a great shot stopper, and getting on a bit, 1 wonder season with us then go to the MLS/sign an extension maybe.",null,0,null,1432507097,null,0,false,0,crjptrk,null,t3_374oc4,null,t1_crjptrk,null,t3_374oc4,null,null,null,1433246501,null,4,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,4,null

S01E01Rose - (How can you not start here? ""Nice to meet you, Rose, now run for your life!"") It's also a good new series introduction and of course, Nine. Fantastic!

S01E06Dalek - Ah the glorious comeback, back when they were still scary. Made it seem like a single one of them could destroy the planet and I think it was the first time the Doctor seemed truly scared and then incredibly pissed. Nine was pissed a lot but that was a sort of pissed only a time lord can get. 

S01E12&amp;13 Bad Wolf &amp; The Parting of The Ways  - first two part I would suggest although really, if you want to fully get it you have to watch all of S1. If you do those two episodes are really harsh and would probably make a good introduction to ""oh fuck...this can be heavy..."" 

I sort of think you need to watch The Christmas Invasion even if it wasn't one of the best, otherwise who the hell is this guy? 

S02E01 (Christmas is technically S02E00) New Earth - I honestly can't say why I'm including this one. It's good, nothing great, but I think it's a great intro to the start of Ten's character development. Also ""Right so you're talkin out your ar..."" ""Ask not!"" What happened to those little funny quips?

S02E04 The Girl in the Fireplace - Probably one of my favorite episodes of them all, I really don't want to say too much to spoil it but really, I think it might be the first time you see the Doctor show that side of himself. Good ending too, was not expecting.

S02E09&amp;10 The Impossible Planet &amp; The Satan Pit - this is one of those great one off things that I don't think they ever did again. The story never fully resolves itself the way other episodes do. Really leaves a lot open to the watcher. 

Here we go...the two that kill everyone. 

S02E12&amp;E13 Army of Ghosts &amp; Doomsday - Those are two of my favorite and  most of the time I find myself noping out on them. It's just too much man. I don't even know what else to say about it, just watch them. Make sure to take along a stiff drink and a cigarette. The beach, the fade...I almost need a drink just thinking about it.

SO3E00 The Runaway Bride - Another Christmas special, actually centered around a future companion. Really I only like it because of her. I mean it's a good episode but the way they meet and the way she acts is totally hilarious. It makes for a decent break after the ultra heavy season 2 ending.

S03E01 Smith and Jones - Again, gotta introduce the new people. The story was pretty good too but other than that, unremarkable. Only really included for the introduction. 

S03E02 The Shakespeare Code - This one cracks me up every single time. I fucking love how they portray Shakespeare, it's just so perfect.

S03E10 Blink - And the introduction of what were for a time the scariest enemies on the show. It was also shot in a different style and there's actually not much appearance of the Doctor and Martha. The way the Doctor managed to work it out was brilliant. Oh, and I have until the rain stops. Way to just smack you in the face in the middle of the episode. 

S04E00 - Voyage of the Damned - Maybe naming a giant space cruise ship Titanic wasn't such a great idea after all. Another Christmas special, this one sees the Doctor all alone on Titanic and as always attempting to save everyone he can. Two of my all time favorite one off characters are in here, Banacathalada and Astrid. I love that name, both of them actually but she was awesome the whole way through. They had me seriously convinced she would leave with him. 

S04E01 Partners in Crime - Hey, Donna Noble, The Runaway Bride is back and this time to stay. Intro sequence is great and paints a picture of someone who really wanted to leave but said no and regretted it. Now she spends her time looking for the Doctor by investigating 'strange' things. Leads to a hilarious reunion. 

S04E02 The Fires of Pompeii - Not only would we get Twelve from this episode, we would also get Amy Pond. (look close at the sisters, especially the one following them at the start) The whole episode was actually pretty good and the culmination of ""You see? That's the choice I have to make..."" is one of the first times, so late in the new series, that it really hits home that sometimes no one wins and there is nothing he can do.

S04E06 The Doctor's Daughter - If you hadn't figured out by now that Ten totally hates guns, violence and war, it'll become really apparent after this episode. In fact I think it's the closest the doctor has come to shooting someone. The story is pretty neat too, the whole numbers thing. Oh and in case anyone lives under a rock and doesn't know, that incredibly beautiful woman who played the Doctor's daughter is in real life, Tennant's wife. Yeah. 

S04E08&amp;E09 - I know a lot of people really like these, and I do too, but the only reason I'm including them is because it's the start of the River story arc and that's pretty important if you plan to keep watching. Don't get me wrong, it was creepy, and I'd still love to know who turned out the lights.

null,false,reddittrees2,null,null,null,"S04E10 Midnight - Super creepy, another monster of the week one and I think everyone says one of the most mysterious episodes so that's all I'll say. Just don't watch this one first because you will be super confused. Hell even people who have seen them all get confused. 

S04E11&amp;E12&amp;E13 Turn Left &amp; The Stolen Earth &amp; Journey's End - So it's time for everyone important to get together and save the world. By now far from extinct there is a giant Dalek armada, Davros, someone a lot of people don't even know, makes his return as do all of the Doctor's recent companions and associated characters. The end of 'Journey's End' just keeps slamming you in the chest for the last like 15 minutes of it. And oh god Bad Wolf Bay and I did not know a TV show could make me that sad. This is another one you're going to want a whiskey and smoke for. 

S05E01 The Eleventh Hour - Welcome back Amy, been a while since Pompeii eh? Not only do we get a brand new Doctor but we get a brand new companion in a pretty interesting way. You hit me with a cricket bat. Twelve years. A cricket bat! Twelve years and four psychiatrists. And yes, he did just save the world from the aliens and then call them back. He wasn't finished with them. Really fun episode actually and it set a good amount of the tone of the next few seasons. 

S05E02 The Beast Below - Amazingly creative concept and story. The entire story was brilliant and you get to know what sort of new Doctor we're dealing with. Also the smilers are fucking creepy. Bad boy, Timmy. 

So5E04&amp;E05 The Time of Angels &amp; Flesh and Stone - marks the return of the baddies from Blink and the continuation of the River story arc. For some reason they're creepy but not as creepy here. Although the disembodied voice of Angel Bob was really creepy. In general tense episodes with lots of running, love the running. I sort of think they should have quit while they were ahead with the angels here. 

S05E07 Amy's Choice - Well we all know the doctor doesn't do relationships but this was always coming in some way with how Amy treated the Doctor and Rory. Told in a back and forth style I really liked too. 

S05E10 Vincent and the Doctor - This is the one everyone utterly loves and I'm right there with them. The portrayal of Vincent was great, I really want to imagine him as a mad raving drunk who actually saw the sky the way he painted it. It's also an incredibly sad episode considering events of the previous two. I hear the song of your sadness. I'm not sad. Then why are you crying? And the end...oh god the end. That was kinda rough. It also resulted in the 'every life is a pile of good things and bad things' line which happens to be one of my personal favorites. 

S05E11 - The Lodger - I have no idea why but I loved this one. It was pretty unique in how it played out and how the day was saved. It's not really a big part of the overall story but it's a cool one off. 

S06E05&amp;E06&amp;E07&amp;E08 - Whew that was long. All four of them are a big long arc that will be spoiled by almost anything I say. The first two were interesting stories by themselves and introduced the flesh and explored morality of what constitutes a person if they're a created person. The second two are really important for the overall story and if you're trying to really watch the whole thing there is no way you can skip these. 

S06E10 The Girl Who Waited - Man this was almost as sad as the end of season 2 or 4. It was a neat concept but the way they executed it...god. Especially again, the end. Their conversation and ""Did I ever tell you about this boy I met there once? We pretended we were in a band.."" strikes a bit of a personal chord with me if you replace that with 'girl I met' and even though I love the episode I tend to avoid it unless I enjoy feeling crushingly sad. 

S06E13 The Wedding of River Song - Well you've made it. I can't say anything at all about this without ruining the entire thing. Just know it's up there in importance if you're following the overall story. 

S07E01 Asylum of the Daleks - A lot of us didn't realize how neat this episode was going to be when it first aired. It starts on an...interesting note...with Amy and Rory none too pleased with each other and where do you get the milk? That'll be important. Someone will pop up here that will be coming back. You know how sometimes we get a future character out of a minor character? 

S07E02 Dinosaurs on a Spaceship - Sort of comedy relief episode, Rory's father is one of the most hilarious characters ever. One minute he's standing on a ladder in the living room and the next he's on a spaceship. Wait, did you just have that on you? Of course! What sort of man doesn't carry a trowel?

S07E03 A Town Called Mercy - I don't see this one mentioned often so maybe it's a personal favorite. Doesn't really have anything to do with any larger story but the basis is really interesting and the other alien doctor makes you really question again, right and wrong and morality. You do take on a new morality when traveling with the Doctor. It's not so black and white. 

S07E05 The Angels Take Manhattan - Ouch. Just...ouch. Knew it was coming, still didn't want it to. Sort of a roller coaster of oh oh shit aw good that's cool oh shit oh shit oh its good now OH SHIT. So many moments and I'm so sorry about your wrist River. 

S07E06 The Bells of Saint John - Technically a Christmas episode, remember at the start of season 7 I mentioned something about minor characters popping up? Well, here she is again. The episode itself wasn't the most interesting thing ever, in fact it's sort of depressing. The Doctor basically doesn't want anything to do with people anymore at this point and flat out refuses to get involved, and apparently had been that way for a while. 

S07E07 The Rings of Akhaten - Look who's back again? Looks like she's in for the long haul now. This one was actually really neat because it's not the first time he's been there (no really, he went in the old series at some point) and I thought the little girl did an amazing job. If that really was her singing, holy shit. This also contains my absolute favorite Doctor speech to date, and I won't do the whole thing here because it's half a page long but: Take mine. Take my memories. I hope you've got a big appetite. I've lived a long time and I have seen a few things. I walked away from the last great time war, I marked the passing of the time lords, I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out moment by moment, no time, no space, just me. I've walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a mad man. I've watched universes freeze and creations burn I have seen things you wouldn't believe I have lost things you will never understand. ....huh I guess I did end up doing most of it. Also ""Because what could have been is always so, so much more than what was."" 

S07E10 Journey to the Center of the TARDIS - Big friendly button. I just liked the atmosphere and at this point in the story I think I was looking for any hint or any clue and this episode just made me more curious. I was so pissed there was no reveal. 

I missed the season 6 Christmas special which just might have been the best one I've seen. A Dr. Who retelling of A Christmas Carrol and one of those bittersweet endings you Brits are so well known for. 

So this turned into more than an introduction. I've been at this for almost two hours now. I would suggest that if you really just want to watch a few episodes you pick one of those but if you want to understand the whole thing start with Nine and watch them all, even the meh ones. 

I stopped early, there were one or two more I could have added, and I haven't really done any of season 8 because...well I haven't really watched it. I watched the first two or three episodes and I'm sorry but Twelve just isn't really doing it for me. I'll have to go back and try again. 

Also I am agreeing with everyone else here that Love and Monsters is one of the worst episodes. Not only was the episode itself bad, but if you start there you will be pretty lost the whole time.

null,false,MrMethamphetamine,null,null,null,"I agree with the sentiment that something has to be done about IS, they can't be allowed to continue to commit crimes against humanity in the name of their religion (or rather a twisted and extreme interpretation of it). I think that we in the West overstate our capacity to have a long-term impact on the problem, though. We have a long and dirty history of involvement in the Middle East and it has never worked out well.

The continued existence of IS is a symptom of the Sunni-Shia schism in Iraq. It requires the support of local Sunni populations to survive. Without that it would wither and die. Why do Sunnis in the region turn to IS, despite its barbaric nature? Because they feel that they have no other choice. They are deeply disillusioned with the Shia-led Iraqi Government. They don't trust them, to put it lightly. There are deep, deep sectarian divides between Sunni and Shia in Iraq and this means that the Sunni's, feeling under threat, have turned to IS to protect them because they see no alternative. Iraq is practically a failed state and it seems there is nobody who can bridge the gap between the two groups and build a trustworthy, stable, non-sectarian government there. I'm oversimplifying things, I'm sure, but this is my layman's understanding from watching the news and reading the occasional analysis piece.

What I think will really solve this conflict is some sort of reunification between Sunni and Shia. We need to see a peace process similar to the one we saw in Northern Ireland, only on a vastly bigger scale. Essentially, the Middle East needs a modern-day Reformation, and, just as the West's did, it can only come from within.

I don't much like IS, but we're short of military options. Indiscriminate bombing isn't going to work: IS don't have enough logistics or industry. And it makes no sense to expend a Storm Shadow missile with a unit cost of $1.3 million on a battered old Toyota land cruiser. We'll run out of missiles before IS run out of targets. 

We can support the regional opponents of IS, but this is complicated by the fact that the most effective component of the Kurds is listed as a terrorist organization by NATO, the US and the EU. The Shia militia are given to atrocities - apparently they have a liking for power tools. Nevertheless the US and allies are providing CAS for the Kurds, and Iran has been providing CAS and ground support for the Shia groups. 

This isn't going to defeat IS, though it will help contain them. IMO the most effective measure is to keep chipping away at their funding. A lot of this comes from the Kingships. There are encouraging signs that they are beginning to realise they are cutting away the branch they are sitting on.

There are white people in lots of places that do much worse than the Bangladeshi community, especially when it comes to schooling where Bangladeshi kids in London have done much better than poor kids from the countryside and small towns over the last 10 years.

&gt;Australia is “one of the most racist countries in the world” is farcical. 

That news piece is kind of bad and the treatment of Aboriginals was (and is in many ways still) awful, and the 'white Australia' policy etc was too. But (just an example of a rich asian country) Japan basically has the equivalent of a 'Japanese japan' policy, has treated the native populations of its peripheral islands in similarly settler colonial ways, also the South Korean immigrant community is treated badly, as well as the burakumin population. 
&gt;[Japan's ethnic Korean community](http://www.japanfocus.org/-Sakanaka-Hidenori/2396/article.html), who are required to register as aliens even if their ancestors have lived in Japan for generations. 

I don't know about Korea and Taiwan but I can't imagine it being all that different and I agree about things being worse in poorer countries.

I think many people who support another year of him only do so because they like him as a person. I think that his signings last summer were really alarming to me. We had the best chance last summer to sign real talent, and by that I mean established talent, but he signed a lot of young players who have never played on a level like the Premiere League level. The Premiere League is the toughest league and really fast paced and its always risky to get young talent from other leagues, Countinho is an exception. And the young players that we have sent out on loan, the prime example being Origi, he loaned to the French league which in my opinion isn't going to get him ready to play on the Premiere League level. Look at players like Ross Barkley, and Gareth Bale when he was young,Barkley was loaned  to  Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds where the football environment is similar to the Premiere League  and Bale was a southhampton and then Tottenham. Loaning young players to leagues other than the Premiere League to me is counter intuitive because it won't prepare them for the fast paced competitive environment of the Premiere League. I think Rafa should be the coach of liverpool again, his problems with Liverpool were with the old ownership not with the Fenway Group. I trust Rafa, and I think he will turn this team around. A fantasy coach would be Carlo Ancelotti but of course thats a fantasy.

If we can bring in Klopp then i'm all for letting Rodgers go. I like the guy and I think he will turn into an excellent manager, but I just think we need to start seeing improvements across the board quickly.

But if we do end up sacking Rodgers then the committee has to go in my opinion. I favour a director of football and I just think it works better for most clubs. Although it can go wrong, I would hope FSG can find someone who knows the game well and will be able to attract players better than we do know, based on reputation.

Klopp can only do so much. If we give him crap transfers then his time here won't be a success. If we do end up hiring him then we have to let him spend big in the summer and bring in players that will suit him and that he agrees on.",null,0,null,1432507706,null,0,false,0,crjq40r,null,t3_374xwx,null,t1_crjq40r,null,t3_374xwx,null,null,null,1433246636,null,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16,null

2) They would have had no need to. The breath test at the roadside (within the met area) actually doesn't indicate a mg per 100ml breath reading. It'll simply come up reading ""zero"" ""pass"" ""warn"" or ""fail"". A device called an EBM must be used at the station. An EBM or evidential breath machine, is accurate enough that it can be used evidentially, as the name suggest. However its about the size of a large tool chest and probably weighs a good 200kg with all the purging gas bottles so isn't mobile. There is some quibbling over how accurate is. Therefore if the machine either malfunctions or gives a reading which indicates it is not working correctly or the lower of the two readings of the samples provided register at less than 50 then the statutory option of ""bloods"" becomes available. If its over 50mg the machine is accurate enough that complete confidence can be had that the samples provided indicate that the driver is/was over the drink drive limit.

3) Drink drive is a mandatory ban of 12 months.


As far as solicitors go, at this point all they can really do is try and poke holes in what is really a very watertight procedure. The arrest will doubtlessly have been lawful, and it will be impossible to prove anything to the contrary at this stage unless the officer's statement was written for them by a five year old or their pet cat they won't have anything there. Even then that probably won't get him out of the drink drive charge. The only thing they can actually really argue with is the station procedure. But then everything is on a standardised form. They do often try and argue in court. I've been to about 10 or so odd cases of that nature and they've never won.

I think it's warranted but in this day and age no top four club is going to sit and suffer another season of re-building and experimentation so I don't think we'll suffer it much longer.  
  
In some ways I do feel like this season of ""rebuilding"" has been a success. Rodgers has been allowed to try several different players in several different positions which is the essence of experimentation and rebuilding. The thing is that again, in this day and age, fans expect instant and constant success and progress and I think it's tricky to balance progress and success with the rebuilding process which has had to happen since Suarez left.  
  
I don't know, it's interesting. If this Summer goes by without significant improvements in the squad then I'll be a lot more critical of Rodgers and the club as a whole.

If anything, I criticize Rodgers more for keeping Can when we could have been trying Lovren-Skrtel-Sakho. I have to think that a natural defender would have slotted better. Also, I think our bigger defensive issue also lies at full back. We are severely lacking and our current full backs don't excel in any area. Moreno shows flashes of brilliance moving forward but can also have brain cramps defensively. Manquillo looked decent enough for the few games he played, not sure whether he will be staying for the second year of the loan. Despite the criticisms leveled towards him, at least Glen Johnson had lots of PL experience. I'd like it if we could bring someones like Alves or Carvajal, but I doubt that will happen.

I would have to disagree with you there. Personally I would say that Henderson, Mignolet, Coutinho, Emre Can and then arguably Sakho and Skrtel on the defensive side of their game have played better this season than last season. That's one of the things I would say Brendan is good at, getting the best out of players.

I would have to disagree with you again on your part about Sanchez. I genuinely think if we had Sanchez this season then we would be comfortably in the top four. Just having a player like that makes everyone around him player better. But I don't think that is an excuse for Rodgers. Because on the other hand you could say that he doesn't have the pulling power on transfers as say Klopp or Rodgers, which is a negative against him.

We don't really know who decided on which transfer in the summer. But we can still make educated guesses. I would say that Balotelli as an example wasn't a Rodgers signing and that he preferred someone like Bony (I think Pearce said it before?).

null,false,JakeSpleen,null,null,null,"Here's what Paul Tomkin's wrote on the subject of Rafa's rotation.

Have a read and see if that changes your opinion. There's some solid evidence here that what you're saying is incorrect


&gt; Myth: Benítez rotates too much.

Truth: In 2008/09, Benítez rotated quite a bit less, on average, than Alex Ferguson: 115 changes compared with 141. The same applies as a whole between 2006 and 2009: 364 by Benítez to 376 by Ferguson.

Myth: Ah, but Benítez rotates his key players too much; United keep a settled core.

Truth: Again, the facts don’t bear this out. Benítez has a core of players – Reina, Carragher and Gerrard – who start pretty much every league match when fit, and several others, including Kuyt and Johnson (Arbeloa before him), who are not far behind. Torres is also entering this category.

Myth: Ah, but Benítez rotates too much given that his squad isn’t as strong as United’s.

Truth: This season Liverpool are being accused of having a weaker squad (although admittedly when several big names have been injured), but then so too are Manchester United, having lost Ronaldo and Tevez. However, Ferguson has made six and seven changes respectively in games United lost away and drew at home. By comparison, Liverpool’s team sheet has been more consistent.

Myth: Rotation simply doesn’t work.

Truth: Rotation does work. United have won the league by making the most changes. However, simply making changes means nothing in itself (drop your striker for the tea lady?), and there are thousands of factors that go into any single result. Sometimes fresh legs and a desire to impress mean that more can be gained from squad players ahead of tired stars, while sometimes a changed side will look disjointed and miss its main match-winners. In these cases, wisdom is easy after the event.

What is true, however, is that most players cannot play every minute of every game, and if they do, they cannot maintain their highest standards throughout. Any sports scientist working within the game will tell you as much.

The top-six team that was rotated the least last season was Aston Villa’s; also known as the team which collapsed in the run in like Mary Decker.

Where a solicitor goes, at this stage, you will find that as its a traffic matter he will have to pay for it himself. Now if he goes through the process and shuts up or he gets a lawyer might not make very much difference so depends if the money is worth it. Best thing I can advise is a bit of googling for a lawyer that deals with traffic matters. 

It might be that he hasn't drunk any more than he says he has. A strong beer and a whiskey could cause a high reading, if he doesn't drink often that will make the reading higher than someone who does as well. Spirits get into the blood very quickly. So whereas beer takes a while to get into the blood stream (thus the level stays lower) whiskey will bring the blood alcohol level (and therefore breath alcohol) level up quite a bit quicker. 

Unfortunately breath testing people who've been involved in a collision is mandatory so he was always going to get checked I'm afraid.

To a point where I struggle to morally justify remaining out of it, even though all my instincts say we should and I wouldn't be lining up to go if we didn't.

We are seeing the introduction of modern day slavery at an unprecedented level, including mass sexual slavery. An entire generation in huge regions of two countries is being lost to the indocrination of ISIS. Massacres regularly take place, with reports sometimes not coming for months because there was nobody left to tell the world. It's at a point where I think we can't stand by and say ""let them kill eachother"" which is what some are calling for - the suffering to innocent life will be immense.

If we continue to use the NI example, what eventually happened was the imposition of order by one side (RUC) which was forever viewed as the ""enemy"" by the other but enforced towards the end of its life relatively equally across both communities, it was then replaced a new independent force as peace progressed. It shows how even with one side massively resenting the other, peace can come about when enforced as the general population are happier.

I definitely do not underestimate our capacity, I think if we are going to do something it has to be all out full scale massive deployment of an international peacekeeping force numbering in 6 figures, and that would mean the loss of many lives and cost the UN tens of billions of pounds. But if we just leave the Iraq war lie to one side, this time perhaps we need to go and enforce peace on the region for the good of the millions of innocent people currently terrorised by a few thousand fighters?

null,false,joylongdivision,null,null,null,"Forwards: Would like Austin. Reminds me of Lambert, can score for QPR, meaning he can score for us. Ings would be alright too, but I feel he's more of a supporting striker like Mane rather than a big guy who can hold it up like Pelle. Great player but not sure he'd be as good as a fit. Might cost more too. 

Midfielders: If Schneiderlin leaves, Clasie pls. Vilhena could be good for the Koeman connection and the loads of potential, but only if he doesn't take away minutes from JWP. Would not mind seeing JWP take Davis' spot, and Hesketh taking JWP's role off the bench/some starts. Think that's all that would really be necessary though. Vic is a god, Davis is fine for now, and Gape, Hesketh, and Reed are coming through the pipeline. 

Wingers: We're set here. Tons of youth coming through, and Duricic and Elia if they sign. I'd rather Duricic than Elia, but I'm unsure if either are worth their fees. Hoping for no signings in this position unless they're signing our loans. 

Center Defense: Again, we're set with or without Toby. I like Gardos, so I'd like to see him get more time, but Maya, Fonte, and Toby are hard to get in front of. McCarthy, Turnbull, and Stephens through the academy getting more time would be nice too. 

Outside Backs: We're good on the left with Bertrand and Targett, but I wouldn't mind seeing a signing on the right even if Clyne stays. Toby and Maya aren't great out there, and there doesn't seem to be an academy prospect on that side outside of Mugabe and McCarthy, one of whom needs another year IMO and the other who seems to really be a center back. Hope Clyne stays of course, but if he doesn't and Sam Byram can be bought for a good price I wouldn't mind that. 

Keeper: No idea. Not sure Gazza will ever be ready, and Cropper needs more time for sure. Wouldn't mind Rob Green or Tom Heaton from the relegated teams, but I was honestly hoping Sunderland or Newcastle would've gone down instead so we could've tried for Pants or Krul. I guess if I had to choose I'd like Heaton, but not sure if he'd be okay with being second fiddle when Forster comes back. Regardless, we need to sign someone, and the Eredivise isn't exactly full of class keepers.

Andy Burnham is not a London MP, so the system of the parliament paying a fairly modest rent for him in London should be applied here. I do know what you mean because it just feels wrong.

Wouldn't it be fairer to pay MPs a wage that lets them sort out there own housing in two places? £65k is not a huge salary for a pretty senior job.

Last season we had momentum, energy, every player on the field had it in his mind that this was it: we were going to win the league. They came out strong game after game and while that enthusiasm would later be our downfall we at least died standing.

Now you look at the field you see Rodger's furiously yelling orders and I highly doubt *anybody* was listening. They aren't playing football they're walking around and occasionally kicking the ball in the air. 

On the field it is a lot different, the manager makes a general plan goes over it with his guys and the Captain is expected to help keep the guys stuck to the plan. But when the Captain is the only guy on the field actually trying to play the game it becomes a little difficult for any form of plan to work out.

null,false,SirBlah,,Cardiff,null,"I'm a bit worried that the Central Station redevelopment is only going to make the concourse area bigger (which isn't a bad thing) and won't be touching any of the station platforms, which are horribly windswept and exposed.

Compare to other major stations like [Paddington](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Paddington_station_MMB_55_332XXX.jpg) or [St Pancreas](http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building3328/media/a1.jpg) which both have a giant canopy covering the platforms, and as well making the station less exposed to the elements also makes them look far more grand and stately, they make an impression. Cardiff Central feels like some small regional hub in comparison.

[Looking at the renders they released a while back](http://i1.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article7440386.ece/alternates/s2197/JS41927365.jpg) (and annoyingly they only released about 3 of them) it seams like that great big canopy they're building *isn't actually going to cover the tracks* for whatever reason. I hope I'm wrong because that would be a massive shame, that thing should enclose the entire station from north to south.

Edit: I'm also a little worried they might mess up the lovely [art deco interior](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Cardiff_Central_railway_station_concourse_-_01.jpg) inside the original station building, it is listed and they did mention that the development won't effect it, but it's difficult to trust the people in charge of the railways sometimes, especially when they (or the people before them) did so much damage to historic station buildings in the name of cost savings, like [the old Queen Street station](http://www.urban75.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cardiff-queen-street-station-3.jpg) in the 1970s [(which used to have it's own canopy as well)](http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s243/sandraanstiss/190020Taff20Vale20Railway20Stati-1.jpg)",null,0,null,1432511932,null,0,1432512400,0,crjs1vf,null,t3_374sq8,null,t1_crjs1vf,null,t1_crjop5s,null,null,null,1433247550,null,3,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,3,null

In recent years, some interviews with survivors have been recorded and compensation has been paid out. Many survivors suffer from disabilities as a result of the exposure, and early death from cancer is common. 

It is hard to know what the exact death toll at the time was, and what it will be when all deaths from radiation-associated conditions are tallied, because the people there were poorly documented, they were mostly children at the time of the tests, and strict tribal rules dictate in what ways death and the dead may be talked about. 

The Flora and Fauna myth, while a myth, resonates for a reason - at Maralinga and across the whole of Australia Aboriginal people were treated as unpeople for more than a century. The land they lived upon was declared as *terra nullius*, their children treated as animals which needed to be caught and domesticated, their murders treated the same way that the murders of rats are treated.

Before today, my reservations about Brendan were his stubborn pride, which led him to stick with failed formations long past their time, to misuse otherwise capable players, and to freeze out those he didn't rate, no matter how badly he could have used their services. Still, when he got a good run going, we seemed invincible, so I wanted to stick with him for at least another season.

But the colossal blunder that was today, starting with a lineup that includes half a dozen midfielders and no strikers, was the last straw. Brendan's experiments are too costly for me to take. We're not a nothing team he's trying to build into something. There are expectations at a club like this, and he DOES have the raw mterials to meet them, he just insists on ignoring them or misusing them:

Just as he can be credited with helping Sterling develop, he can be blamed for stunting Can's development by constantly playing him in a position he's not suited to. 

He bought Lambert, a very effective target man, only to either ignore him, or use him in a system not suited to his skillset. Either change the system, or don't bring the player on! Same goes for Balo.

null,false,yourtypicallank,null,null,null,"I thought that was quite tragic, and really disappointing. There was a real lack of energy in the team - no one seemed to want the win. We were doing all these long passes, and shots from out of the box which were really just full of nothing.

A few good goes at goal, but that Goalkeeper was class. Hats off to him, but then again, some of the attempts were very half-hearted.

What annoyed me the most, was there were so many times that a Villa player had his arms up for the ball when he was in space, and no one wanted to pass (i'm looking at you Delph).

Bacuna has so much ball time, but did very little with it. Bad crosses when I think running with it or short passing would have achieved more.

So many bad touches from everybody. Grealish had some shockers, but so did Sinclair, Gabby and N'Zogbia as well.

Speaking of N'Zogbia, WTF was he doing as a left back? Why would you play him over any of the other several good defenders we have in that role? He spent more of his time up past the center-mids than he did on the back line.

Vlaar missed two good attempts, Gabby missed one of the easiest finishes I've seen, and Delph's attempts were very, very poor. We just can't always rely on Benteke to score all the time!

And finally, and this really gets me, Where the fuck was Gil. This was the perfect game to play him again. It's what the fans wanted to see, and it was a perfect time for Tim to test him out, perhaps even trying a winger-focused team formation?

I think Ings and Milner will be good signings if we snag them both. I have no doubts they'll perform, and won't end up like Jovanovic/Cole. Ings may have injury history so that's a concern but Milner is Henderson-reliable. 

The hardest part sadly is getting the best out of some good players (Borini, Balotelli, Lovren, Enrique) who may still be good enough for us in a different system/with a different manager and figuring out what to do with the others (Aspas, Alberto). There are also established players who may be moved on like Lucas, Toure). Our priority has to be to sell players first, especially the ones that aren't going to start any games regardless of manager (like Lambert, Borini, Aspas). 

I'm unsure about Coates, Alberto and Ilori. I expect them all to go out on loan again. Manquillo won't stay if BR stays I reckon. 

Problem positions are going to be up front and in defensive midfield (I'm sorry, we need an old fashioned dynamic enforcer like Masch/Momo - Lucas does not the legs have). Then it's RB and GK. We would have finished 4th if we'd had either a world class goalkeeper or Danny fit all season. With both, it would have been comfortable. I'm not saying we can get a world class goalkeeper (and there aren't many left/available) but look at how much Lloris saves Spurs (who have a poorer defence than we do on paper) or De Gea carries United and you can see the difference it makes. I'm not sure Sturridge will ever recover from his injury proneness but RvP and RvN did it before so anything is possible. Still, I think we just need someone like Ings in if we are confident about Sturridge and can't unload the others. He'd get on great with Couts, Lallana and Henderson, considering he's a far more mobile version of Lambert - instinctive, clever feet, clinical.

I'm just worried about the lack of tempo in midfield and up front. It's cost us so much this season not being able to control games. That's not down to tactics - you need a player or players who understand gamesmanship and we are lacking a lot of that in this team. Only option is to buy that.

We finished about where we expected (5th-7th) and a slew of signings really isn't needed to kick on. For the first time in a long time the required steps for progression are very clear and near every Spurs fan can seemingly agree on them.

Contrast to last season, AVB and Sherwood sacked, no identity and no heart. People wanted every player gone and every position filled with a new face, we couldn't even agree on a new manager. We were basically in the position Liverpool find themselves in now and my God it feels good to have it behind us. 

A grew up following rugby league and the core of any good team was a solid spine (1, 6, 7 and 9) - I feel like the football equivalent for Spurs has emerged this season with Lloris, Bentaleb, Eriksen and Kane. That's the kind of core we need to build around in the summer and luckily we have most of the parts in the garage already: Rose, Dier, Vertonghen, Walker, Lamela and Chadli. By my count that really only leaves a CM to come in and a sprinkle of depth for the guys who ran their legs off and ran out of puff (Pritchard anyone?). 

All in all I expect Spurs to finish 5-7th next season as a minimum and challenge for 4th or a cup as an added bonus. I think if we got to a Europa League semi final I would have to fly back out to Europe again just to catch it. 

Going forward, I hope to see much the same line up that showed up against Chelsea and the arse in Round 1 next season. No need for a shake up, stability feels good.

Lloris (Vorm)

Walker (Yedlin) - Dier (Fazio) - Vertonghen (Wimmer) - Rose (Davies)

Bentaleb (Paulinho) - New face (Mason)

Lamela (New Face) - Eriksen (Pritchard) - Chadli (Townsend)

Just. He is so inept tactically its a fucking joke, and even worse at buying players (Baldock, Maiga, Jarvis, Carroll).

It really wouldn't take much for another manager to have achieved more, considering the time and resources that were made available to Allardyce. I agree that he did what he had to do, but he did it in a very unconvincing manner. If I had to grade him I would give him a low pass.

Furthermore, I think you're the ignorant and myopic one here - just taking the fact that we've stayed in the PL at face value without considering the context. It's not as if Allardyce was working on a shoestring budget with a shit team and a stingy, unreasonable board.

I do however agree that MP's should be paid more money as a wage than what they are getting already.  £67K is criminal for the amount of responsibilities they have, especially when you can be a backbencher on £67K or a Chairperson of a Select Committee at £80K.    Life after Parliament does mitigate this pay issue as many MP's walk into good consultancy jobs.  But You could be a brand new MP and be earning only 20K less than a MP with decades of experience being on several committees and chairs.

* Tying GB to a Kipling quote is pretty disingenuous since Kipling himself was a supporter of Empire. Akala paints the picture of Empire as an objectively bad thing, which it wasn't. It's not black and white and while we did do a lot of countries a lot of lasting damage still felt to this day, we did provide education and infrastructure. I'm one of the biggest critics of the British Empire myself, since we left a lot of Afican countries with easily corruptible governments, but you can't paint it in the light Akala is.

* ""Do we have the same racial disparity in prisons to America? Yes absolutely."" Really? So 1 in 3 Black males in Britain will go to Prison at some point of their life here too? This is my main issue with him, he skims over this, giving no specifics as to who or what statistic he's referring to and then bases his argument off said vague evidence.

* ""The grandchildren of Nazis can get in this country easier than the grandchildren of the commonwealth."" So after all his talk he wants to judge people on the basis of what their grandchildren did? His point should be that both have an equal right to come here, not one does over the other because of what their grandchildren did. 

* I've never heard anyone refer to the aussies or NZ people as ""Ex-pats."" White immigrants are not referred to as ex-pats, otherwise Polish and Romanian people wouldn't be getting such a hard time in the press?

I agree with him on the Katie Hopkins argument, that had echos of Rwanda to it. Anyway...


* Africans and Asians coming here after ""The Queens cousins bombed us in WW2."" He's literally talking about the wrong World War.

* We don't talk about being saved by America, the Americans do. High school history you get taught that Russia played the biggest part.

* His Tower Hamlets/Canary Wharf argument is more about Capitalism than it is about race.

* Using the reporting in Australia of Anders Brevik's attacks hardly adds anything to the argument that Britain is institutionally racist.

Honestly, don't reply.  This is a time waster and I should have realized it:  everytime you state something that's not so popular on this sub you risk getting involved in those time-wasting debates where others will just feel so emotional about your post.

As for Rodgers, I've already said there is nothing to support why he should stay.  As I said (getting pretty tired of repeating myself), you can thank Suarez for last season.  For Sterling's development, you can thank the lack of players we had in his position during that season as well.  For Coutinho, you can thank the transfer committee since sources have said it was them who actually brought him.  Rodgers has shown nothing to show why he deserves more time.  This is my opinion, whether we won or lost today it has always been my opinion.

He is the manager and he sets out his team to play a certain way, and then he is, more or less, reliant on them from there to get him the result. Rodgers made his fair share of errors, there is no escaping that, but to lump the blame on Rodgers alone for today, and the season in general, is just plain stupid. Rodgers might not be the man for the job, and I am hopeful we will make a move for Klopp or Rafa (however unlikely) to replace him, but I've had it with this revisionist tripe that puts all Liverpool's woes this season down to him but puts all Liverpool's success last season down to a  ""perfect storm"".

Nobody expected any of those forwards to score bucket loads of goals, but at least give them a chance to chip in. Losing at home is acceptable, making Palace look like Brazil is not. Stoke played well and deserved to win, but again, we made them look like a top four team.

Teams have figured us out, they are doing a Liverpool, on Liverpool. We couldn't defend against wingers if we tried, and for us having Skrtel and Lovren in defense, we concede headed goals from crosses for fun. The whole team and formation needs fixing, and then stick with the formation. I just don't trust Rodgers to be able to do that.

Players we need won't come if they know that the players we already have won't play for him, and it was already apparent against Palace. It was obvious yesterday aside from Lallana, everybody just gave up. I would not trust him with another pre season, or getting players we need.

1) The company must call you after you have asked them not to.

3) You need to be certain you have the same company both times

4) You need them not to fight the claim in court. The linked guy got a out of court settlement, with no real 
discussion as to the actual legal merits of a verbal-only contract for spurious money charges.

As I say, I appreciate people like the idea that you could charge someone for wasting your time, but the reality is less then ideal.

If this went before a actual judge, the guy would have had to have proven that his verbal contract was agreed to, and most likely would have had to have shown that his £195 charge was reasonable representation of actual cost to him in terms of consumed time (spoiler, it wasn't).

The production team needed a way to be able to record two episodes at the same time, since they were focusing so much time, effort and money into filming ""The Impossible Planet"" and ""The Satan Pit"", a double episode.  They created the idea of a Doctor-Lite episode, freeing up actors and crew, while still getting in their contractually obligated episodes.


At the time, it was an extremely bizarre episode, missing the doctor and companion.  It also included as a main villain a monster created by a 9-year old child, and it showed.


The episode was extremely bad at setting tone.  There were a lot of light hearted and comedic encounters juxtaposed with very serious and dark settings and events.  Don't even get me started on the Scooby Doo ""running through doors"" gag, being chased by a guy in a fat suit, green makeup and a mohawk.


Then the doctor shows up at the last moment and traps a girl in a piece of pavement, effectively turning her into a conscious sex toy.


Honestly, it almost felt like an SNL parody of Doctor who, complete with rubber monsters, bad effects, low production values and missing any really good characters.

When the manager plays three players out of position for a season, is it something that he sees but we don't? Because it clearly not working for us, especially Can at RB, I just don't get it, he is set to take over Gerrard, came from another league, first season in EPL and gets thrown in at defence despite having Johnson and Manquillo available, what does it do for his confidence after a match/season like this. Then we sign another left CB in Lovren after signing Sakho (approx $20m each) instead of a right CB with Carragher retired and Skrtel's future unclear. Oh and the issue of having three fit strikers but not playing a single one yesterday, BR signed every single one of them, Borini, Balotelli, Lambert with Aspas, Alberto and Origi on loan. I mean look at how Aspas is playing now and he is in the Europa League finals with Sevilla!!! Borini was having a good season with Sunderland on loan last season too.

Voting for a candidate is you giving your consent to an individual to have authority to impose their views on others.

Toby is essential. He's become an integral part of the defence. However with Godin and Miranda both hovering around 30, they might decide they want him back. The only other I would keep is Djuricic, he's looked good coming on and provides a creative spark. Elia on the other hand hasn't shown me enough to pay a fee for him.

To purchase:
GK: Obviously need someone to cover for Forster, with Tom Heaton immediately coming to mind. His performance have earned him an England call (albiet due to injuries), and should be relatively cheap coming from a relegated club. Szczesny is still only 25 and has experience playing for a top club, so he could be another option.

CB: If we manage to seal Toby, then we still need to sign another. If he doesn't, we need 2. Even though there are some young guys coming through the ranks, we need some more experience. Van Dijk has been impressive in Scotland, has Champions League experience, and is only 23. European experience could prove indispensable. Unsure what other CBs are on the radar.

RB: I have faith Clyne will stay, but if he goes to united we could try wrangle someone like Rafael from them? Just an idea. 

DM: Assuming Schneiderlin goes, I would be happy with Clasie and/or Tonny Vilhena. I think Reed needs a season or so more coming from the bench before fighting for a starting role.

ST: I think it's here that we need to be ambitious. There are a few players names floating around who could be available. I personally would love to see Hernandez join. His national coach has said a step down might be good for him. He wouldn't be super expensive, and would provide a different option to Pelle up top. Now if we were to be reeeeeeeeally ambitious, how about RVP? Yes his wages are monstrous, but he doesn't exactly have much chance going to another top club. Koeman should give him a call, and try seal a deal. Even a loan would be incredible. However a more realistic option is someone like Austin or Ings. Personally would prefer Austin, but Ings being a Saints lad could do a job for us. How about taking a punt on Jordan Rhodes as a backup?

**Probably out:** Kolo, Sterling, Borini, Balotelli **OR** Lambert

**Definitely in:** Origi, Illori, other loaned out players. Up to management who will be sold, who will remain, and who will go out on loan.
**Speculated in:** GK, RB, Milner, Ings +/- ""top class forward""

Feasibly we need **two solid keepers**, meaning we have to bring in someone to compete with Migs, as Brad is out the door. Romero/Neto/Matt Ryan are all names being thrown around.

**Defensively**, Alberto Moreno is not solid, but between him and Enrique we can put that position on the backburner and mark it as ""not urgent"". As for RB, we will be short, particularly if Manquillo goes too, and this needs to be addressed. Janmaat would be an incredible signing IMO. As for CB, between Skrtel, Lovren, Sakho, Illori, Wisdom, and Can (in emergencies),  I think we're set.

**In midfield**, I think we're mostly solid except for a solid CDM to compete/succeed Lucas. He's great when fit, but very injury prone. We have Can, Allen and Hendo as our ""engine"" sort of players, which is solid for rotation. Lallana, Coutinho, Origi, Ibe, and Markovic provide pace and cerativity, and I wouldn't bring in another attacking midfielder as we have Sinclair, Ojo, and Texiera all waiting for a chance.

**Strikers** are an issue that seems to split the LFC fanbase.  I'd love it if Balo stayed another season, as it's harsh to judge a player on one season. That said, the same argument can be made for Lambert. I think one will go out the  door with Borini. That leaves 1 + Studge + Origi. Most will say Ings, and he would be a decent, low-risk option that I would support. He can be loaned out, and his value will only go up as a potential England international.

That's the fundamentals for me, and I'm happy. Once that has all been addressed, I would love a ""luxury"" signing or two, with the Sterling money and the Stevie + Glen wages. Whether it's a realistic target like Aubameyang, or someone a bit out of our usual reach like Higuain. Whoever it is, as long as they bring their A-game and are value for money, then I'll most likely be in favour of it. This would give us a broad enough squad to compete on multiple fronts, though the issue of leadership needs to be addressed if we're going to get anywhere. This means both coach, and some senior players. Milner would help, so would an experienced keeper like Romero, Handanovic (1 year left on contract), Cech, whoever.

Cities that are built either purposely or organically to foster chance encounters, opportunities for exchange of ideas and so on are more successful. The narrow streets of the city of London for instance are a premium example, crisscrossing and connecting different places where people meet and exchange ideas and work together. It works better than communication over distance that around the world cities are investing in closeness and collaboration. Another example in London, at Kings Cross where new science and r&amp;d buildings are being made to specifically foster collaboration between different people of different and similar areas, with open plan labs and common meeting places.

Integration that allows people to interact with each other, especially in a human scale have proven important to the creative class and professionals of nowadays. The Randstadt in the Netherlands is a superb example of cities being connected to foster collaboration. Rail and motorways connecting Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague into one big polycentric metropolis.

Investment in the internet is surely vital, it presents huge opportunities for growth and as we rely on it and mobile devices and so on more and more it certainly can not be something people shy away from investment. But it can't mean actual transportation to connect people lags behind. 

Continental Europe is already connected by rail and it benefits from the free movement. Now only London is connected and if the rest of the uk remains isolated it will only accentuate the gap between London and the other cities. It shouldn't even be a question of whether hs2 should be built, Britain's cities are already behind today, and will be even more in 15 years in comparison to other European cities. 

HS2 should be built as well as better connection within the cities to the central stations. In Birmingham, Manchester and so on. It is no good of a journey down to London is fast but to get to New Street Station in the first place it takes ages.

Building it not only makes sense because there is already huge due to capacity issues, but also for how it can foster growth and development. Just look at canary wharf and east London. How much growth the extension of the jubilee line brought. To a similar extent, if done right, that's what hs2 and hs3 can bring. And in a sustainable way, not with individual transportation, but mass public one, that is fast and productive. You can't consume cultural content or work inside your car, but you certainly can sat on a train.

null,false,keerin,null,null,null,"This is quite common, and people often put it in because they feel like they have to. This area is one of the places you can truly stand head and shoulders above the competition, or at least make sure your cv doesn't go straight in the bin. 

You can use this area in a very strategic way. Don't write stuff like ""I enjoy socialising in my spare time"" or anything else that also just happens to be a basic human activity, like ""I enjoy spending time with my kids"". These things don't flesh you out as a real person.

What you ideally want to do is write down real things you actually do (or have done) and describe them in a way that allows a recruiter to read between the lines that you are a person who would fit well in the company culture. If you are not sure of the company culture or you are using one cv for many jobs (you crazy!) then you can use this opportunity to fill in any holes in the requirement spec you feel your employment history or experience can't fill. 

For example, I work as a project manager in a web development agency. When I applied for this job, I was applying speculatively to multiple businesses. But the main things that make for a successful project manager are organisation, planning and communication. All of the descriptions of my interests and experiences emphasises at least one of these.

I didn't just say I used to train and fight Muay Thai. I said that I trained and competed in a full contact martial art while studying at college and working a part time job. Organisation and planning skills are easy to read between the lines there. 

Primarily, you want to show that you are a real person. More than that however, you have a great opportunity in this section to prove that you are a person the employer would want to work with, and that you will fit in well with the company culture. You should also be looking at ways to bend what you already do to put you in the best light possible with regards to emphasising desirable skills which are harder to fulfill through employment history. 

One final thing. I said not to put things that are expected of almost any human being, like enjoying socialising with friends or spending time with your kids. Also don't put anything remotely likely to be construed as inappropriate. If it seems like you'll be applying for a place where there is a blokey culture, you may want to leave out that you are soccer referee, and leave out which team you follow. Religion isn't an out and out no no, but people can be turned off by the stereotype of preachy Christians as much as they may be put off by employing someone with visible tattoos. So if you spend a lot of time on church activities, call them community activities. Unless the business or the employer are known to be Christians of course!

I don't go to other teams subreddits any more, but I was a bit disgusted seeing how many Manchester City fans turned on Yaya or Kompany when they had a bad game or run of form. When Lazar had that [red card happen to him](http://i.imgur.com/HHG9ufT.jpg) for being the only player in red who seemed to want to put the ball in the net, a fan here blamed him for our failure, but was basically the only one. When Dejan missed the penalty that concluded our European efforts this season, supporters supported, and praised him for his courage.

Basically, I think we all need to be like the supporters who sang You'll Never Walk Alone as soon as the Chelsea game fell apart last season, and less like the fans that only like the players when the results are good. Luis basically left because of how the English media made him feel, and Mario appears emotionally affected by the way people talk about him.

""Hatred"" of Rangers stems from ingrained social ""norms"" and historical ties. Not being from or more so having grown-up in the west of Scotland generally means that your exposure to Rangers is purely a football one. Whereas those of us that were brought up in the west of Scotland know Rangers not just as footballing rivals but social ones too. Catholic/Protestant, establishment/immigrants, school segregation. All of these thing add up to a deeper ""hatred"". 

Linage also has its part to play. You mention that you started to like Celtic fairly recently; on the other hand there are those of us who are 3rd/4th/5th generation Celts and have had to go through Rangers being smug fuckers for the best part of a decade while Celtic nearly went to the wall.   That Rangers haven't been about for a fairly large chunk of your time as a Celtic fan and they've been shit, so it meant that as Celtic we don't focus on them because they're not a threat.

This is why you can't ""hate"" them. 

EDIT: Seen as most have said if they hate Rangers or not...I hate them; I never want to see them do well. I am elated to see the state they are in and genuinely believe Scottish football is in a better state because of it. I hope that they go to the wall again and Rangers as an entity are no more.

Rodgers has got to improve as a manager during down periods. He is great at sustaining runs of good form but quite poor at getting out of runs of bad form.

First with that brilliant goal against Man Utd (Ferguson's feared Man Utd, that you could only dream of beating), and again he scored in the final.  That alone caused a huge mentality shift not only in the players, but also in the fan base.  I recall in teh build up to the final, everyone was quaking with cliams of ""typical city;"" afterwards there was a belief that the club was a winner.  

In the 2012 season review DVD, you see Micah talking of how Yaya said that they're going to win the league...against a Newcastle that was challenging for top 4.  When he saw no one else was going to do it, he scored twice.

So many times in 2014 he was brilliant in mid-field.  I don't mean in terms of goals (though he did score a lot), but his passing, and positional play was great (I loved watching him and Nasri play together last season).

Johnson is leaving in defence but we all know we need to sign a RB, although that will not be Montoya if Alves has indeed decided to leave Barcelona. Kolo Toure will either be offered a contract or replaced with Ilori, who has reportedly been impressive on loan.

Brad Jones is leaving and we will sign a keeper to replace him, most likely Ryan or Neto.

Sterling may also leave but will be replaced (Hopefully by Pedro).

Looking back at last summer, we chased Andros Townsend for a long time, eventually missing out and bringing in Long and Mane (slightly different players) and then Elia (who's been average). I wouldn't be surprised if we go for someone similar again this summer: not a wife forward who will be looking at getting into the box at every opportunity, but someone who can stay wide, beat defenders and put quality crosses onto Pelle's beautiful head. I'm thinking Nathan Redmond, perhaps Matt Phillips. 

When Wanyama hasn't played, Koeman has often put Toby as DM which in my opinion hasn't been that successful. I don't know enough about Clasie to know if he could drop into Vic's destroyer role, but if not we might need cover there. I wonder if Vilhena can play that role, anyone know?

We need a right back if Clyne stays or goes. It's great that he's played nearly every game this season but we can't rely on that again. Yoshida looks half the player out wide, Toby not much better, and he probably won't be here next season. 

Assuming Toby doesn't stay, I think we need at least one centre back. Yoshida has improved a huge amount and is a good backup, but not a first teamer for a club fighting for European football. Gardos? I just don't know.  Seems leaden-footed, but that hasn't stopped someone like Mertesacker. Perhaps with another preseason he'll step up. In my opinion he needs to if he wants to stay and be useful. 

Ive made some points in a [wonderful article you should all read](http://thedellboys.com/2015/05/21/saints-striker-shopping-list/) perhaps a few more times each about strikers: of the realistic options I think Austin would add the most to our squad. 

Keeper situation is really difficult. No one will want to come in, play for one season, then play second fiddle to Forster. I do think there were question marks over Forster even before his injury: he's made mistakes he shouldn't have, and doesn't dominate his area like he should. But he is a quality keeper at a good age.

And that's your right, to be honest. Being English, I respect and am glad for the fact that Pochettino pretty much contributes to the starting XI of our NT after just three years in England. Mourinho has been in England on and off for what, eight years? He's probably brought through three players in his time here.

null,false,oj109,null,null,null,"Ugh. As an economics and finance major at a top university, I hate it when people make the rookie mistake of conflating economic size with wealth. Especially for a *university academic journal!*

The UK is indeed one of the largest economies in the world - and one of the most advanced (high skilled, specialised etc) However it is far from the wealthiest. Our GDP per capita is only around $39,000 whereas Scandinavia, Australia and Canada are at around $60,000. Singapore and Switzerland (small economies) are amongst the wealthiest around $80,000 per capita. 

Furthermore, income in the UK is more unequal than most other wealthy countries (bar the US) where it's concentrated amongst the very few (5% are fabulously rich, and 25% are middle class with the rest being working class) If there was a street of 20 households - 15 of which earn £20,000 - 4 who earn £200,000 and 1 who earns £1 million a year the 'average' would be £105,000 a year although most people earn £20,000. 

However, even more insidious- which cannot be quantitatively defined is that there is also staggering regional, political, social, cultural and opportunity inequality.

&gt;The __Croatia national football team__ ([Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language): *Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija*) represents [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia) in international [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football). The team is controlled by the [Croatian Football Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Football_Federation), the governing body for football in the country. A [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA)-recognised national side had previously represented the short-lived [Banovina of Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banovina_of_Croatia) and [Independent State of Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia) in [nineteen friendly matches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team_games_%E2%80%93_1940s) between 1940 and 1944.  This team was dissolved in 1945 as Croatia became a constituent federal republic of [SFR Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia). In the period between 1945 and 1990, Croatia did not field a separate team for competitive matches and Croatian players played for the [Yugoslavia national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia_national_football_team).

I like to keep cards like ""Hmm, a situation where I worked as a team?

GK: Mignolet.. meh,great shot stopper but distribution is poor but again new gk is a luxury buy

RB: no top class RB..have to buy one

LB: Moreno has been bad,enrique hasnt played in a long time. But situation is manageable.

CB: Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren, Kolo...Not good enough. Sakho is injury prone, Lovren has been crap, Kolo is old. We have one good defender that can play the whole season..Skrtel. We need an experienced defender, I think we will sell Ilori and Coates and buy one.

DMF: Lucas/ Can/ Allen..Lucas is not mobile enough and injury prone. I see Can in a box 2 box role next season. We need a quality DM.

Playmaker: None...Need a quality play maker.

Box to Box : Hendo/ Can.. This is one area where we need not make any changes. what we have is good enough.

Wingers : Sterling, Lallana, Markovic, Ibe , Coutinho..We have enough I feel but a goal scoring winger would be great Pedro/Depay but its still a luxury buy.

Striker : Borini, Balo, Lambert.. Not good enough, cut the losses let them go. Build a new Strikeforce Sturridge, Origi, 2 top quality CFs.

If I missed any, they are all deadweight. Now you can see we almost need to buy 4-5 top quality players to atleast paper over the cracks. 

To add to the problems, BR seems to have lost the dressing room. If thats true, another 10m to get rid of him. Our pitch looks like shit but cant be relaid this season.

I can see why owners seem to be reluctant to change. The transition will cost us 150m+ and we dont have the money to do it. Honestly next season will be another transition with a 5th or 6th place finish. Get used to it.

Out of the 15 people in total that I have trained up on 9 are left. Most of them are older folk who actually understand its a workplace and also enjoy it the most because it is 'relaxed'.

Other departments have issues with overall performance, and its not a fundamental flaw in the way we work. It's simply that the (mostly) young workers think they don't need to reach targets and have an excuse a day for why they hasn't reached it - same folk that will stand around for 15 minutes talking to their mates. 

To answer some of the questions from the second part - I know they are not directed to me, but to give you an idea it is a real job.

Pay is just above minimum wage, rising about a pound after 12 weeks. 25ish days a year holiday, you are expected to work bank holidays but you get extra pay and an extra day holiday.

Even if the threat is not credible, the problem with social media is that you can't know - people post their locations and plans, it's within the realms of possibility for someone to follow up a threat! 

Now the genuine jokes are another story, for example the infamous Robin Hood airport case. But they are the minority, most people who claim it was a joke are like the bully who claims calling you a faggot was just a joke.

In my 30 years being a liverpool supporter (I'm 36 today, on the 10th anniversary of Istanbul), I've never, not once, been so disillusioned with our club.  Even under Hodgson there was light at the end of the tunnel.  

For the first time, we have no heart and soul at the club.  Players like Jay Spearing and Martin Kelly are no worse than Allen or Manquillo, respectively.  But Rogers' need to stamp his authority meant these local lads had to go.  Can you genuinely say Manquilo is better than Kelly, when fit?  Kelly was being considered future England captain.  Yes, he suffered a lot of injuries.  But he's just about recovered now.  

Liverpool football club, whether struggling for 5th or challenging at the top of all competitions has always been considered a classy, traditional club with values.  I no longer see that.

ISDS are not the bogeymen they are often portrayed to be, they are found in nearly all the 94 trade treaties the UK have signed since 1975 and yet 2 challenges have been bought under them. And how many have been successful? Zero! (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311247/bis-14-695-investor-state-dispute-settlement-faqs.pdf) By all means argue for them to be more transparent but making out that they will destroy the NHS is ridiculous scaremongering. 

Trade negotiations are always conducted behind closed doors, otherwise you will give important information to the other side which will hurt your position. You don't tell the estate agent everything you are thinking when you're buying a house, you make up your mind in private and then put your offer on the table. The same with trade negotiations, you can't have the country decide the terms in public because then the other side knows how far they can push you or more sinisterly will attempt to manipulate public opinion to their benefit.

Once negotiations are completed the deal is made public and then parliaments must ratify it, this is the time when people give their opinions and MPs take that into account. This is when your council should be sending letters to their MPs and MEPs. Doing something like this at this stage is stupid, you don't have any of the information and it makes you look like an ideologue rather than rational human being.

Schneiderlin (pls no)

Ins:
A striker - I would love Charlie Austin, with Europe 4 strikers 2 of which are versatile would be great. I like Pelle and think he will get better next season as well.

Morgans replacement :'( - This will be the biggest purchase. Schneiderlin has been so important in everything we have done well the past 3 seasons. It will be tough to replace him. I would like us to try and get a player out of our league and tempt them in. 

Tobys replacement :'( (Maybe) - I hope, and think, we will re-sign him but if we dont this is certainly an area to splash the cash. Clearly our defensive scouts are top drawer, Lovren and Toby both complimented Fonte exceptionally so another ball playing left sided CB is on the cards. 

GK - Koeman has said Forster is the planned no.1 going forward so it will most likely be loan. I'd be tempted to go for a top no.2 that is stuck on the bench. Like Swansea with Fabianski last year. 

Strengthening the side:

Attacking midfielders. I think Mane's true calling is in behind the striker, or given loads freedom, so I think an two out and out wingers that can beat players and make a difference (similar to what Palace have in Bolasie and Zaha. That would give us the depth of 4 strong options there (Mane, Tadic, JWP, Jay Rod, Winger and Long). 

I would also expect us to strengthen in defence. A replacement for Gardos who is better than Yoshida would be great.

I don't think it will be super busy, but hopefully we will sign some good quality as opposed to just depth. ",null,0,null,1432547560,null,0,false,0,crk5ez5,null,t3_374oc4,null,t1_crk5ez5,null,t3_374oc4,null,null,null,1433253956,null,1,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,1,null

One way Price wise: £150 train or £90-£130 plane inc. train to Bank
One way time: six and a half to seven hours (plus time to get to Glasgow station). Vs. 5 hours (one and a half hour flight, one and a half hour check-in, plane things, 1 hour to Bank. Plus travel time to Glasgow  airport. )
Coming down the day before vs taking the first flight (at £160 - £200, might save you a hotel night depending on time of arrival into Bank. First plane into Gatwick at 0815)

If you live in Edinburgh, east coast would take about 5 hours on the day before plus a hotel stay, first train arrives at 09:40 into kings cross.

This is only a rough guide. Actual journey times may differ. One must remember that times are done so that no running takes place, there is time to relax before your journey, time must be factored in for delays and connection times and with hand luggage. I haven't included time or price to Glasgow airports or stations, because I have no idea where people travel from.

If the TC is abandoned and Rodgers is promised serious investment to really push on then ok keep him. But if a big name manager like Klopp came in then never mind the TC for a sec, because investment is on its way.

For the 60th anniversary special, McCoy appears as *The Librarian* - although it’s hotly disputed whether this is intended to be a future Doctor, or possibly some incarnation of Braxiatel.  

Colin Baker, of course, makes an appearance as the final, seemingly redeemed, form of the Valeyard in the “Series 13” specials.  

McGann’s appearance as a version of the Doctor from the alternate Gallifrey in the 75th anniversary has yet to be addressed further, and a common theory is that he is future version of the Eighth Doctor from the novels, rather than the *Night of the Doctor* version.  

Eccleston’s return out of the blue - after a complete media lockdown during production – as *The Keeper*, in the  spin-off mini-series *Time Zero* was widely acclaimed. Production of a second season is rumoured to be underway, but it is unclear if he will feature again.  

Tennant has, of course, appeared as the trans-dimensional holosynth of Meta-Ten in *Angel Dust* and *Crack of Doom*.  

We don’t yet know if Smith has agreed to appear in *The 21 Doctors* himself, but it is clear that he will appear in digital reconstruction form, along with the earlier Doctors, if nothing else.

The way I look at it is that he has been trying hard throughout the games - tireless work ethic almost like Dirk Kuyt plus gifted with a good skill to turn on the move, good control over the ball. Remember the goal he scored against Swansea when Fabianski got flustered by his pressing! I will not label him as a failure (yes i might be in minority) but why were people expecting him to score 15-20 goals a season.

What rant? Pro-scum papers said it was a rant. It was Rafa making several valid points reasonably and a few jokes. No rant. Have you actually watched the video?

Josemi was a stop gap measure because the senior squad had no RB cover. Paletta turn in a profit (in fact, Rafa's players generated over $100 in profit for LFC). Aquailani cost $4.5m - all the money that H&amp;G gave him for Alonso's sale. Keane was a Parry purchase, who negotiated the deal without Rafa's knowledged to save face for bungling the Barry deal.

Mourinho left an aging team at Inter. Moratti promised Rafa funds for six new players. He then renegade on it just before the trsf window - Rafa blew a gasket. Understandably, after his experience with H&amp;G. Samuel Eto said the Italians in the team disrespected Rafa with the full backing of Moratti. Still he won two trophies (Rafa has won trophies at every club he has managed).

At Napoli, he is going against the strongest Juventus team in the last decade. ",null,0,null,1432552241,null,0,false,0,crk6g31,null,t3_373ilb,null,t1_crk6g31,null,t1_crjjw95,null,null,null,1433254441,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

2) Open a ""Regular savings account"", these don't have the tax free wrapper that ISAs have, but often pay better amounts of interest. You need to pay a minimum amount in each month though, and can't exceed the maximum. Withdrawals are generally not permitted. 

Also a lot of them stipulate you have a current account with them too, so it's worth considering that

I didn't say they would remain secret forever.

EG: Balotelli scored 30 goals in 54 games for AC Milan. Impressive. But 10 of those were from the spot and 5 from free kicks. And this is the most important part: Balotelli scored only 15 goals from open play. 15! I'm not concerned about how many goals they scored per se, but how many open play goals they've scored. And he scored 15 open play goals in 54 games. You do realise we needed to replace a Suarez who scored 31 goals from open play? It's the same case with Borini. 

Here I've dug up some stats for you:

Last season, none of Borini, Lambert or Balotelli made double figures for open play goals. Their non-penalty, non-direct free kick totals were:

Balotelli - 7
Lambert - 8
Borini - 4

Given that Gerrard and Henderson and Coutinho are on direct free kicks and penalties, expecting any of those three to score from open play and get on the ends of moves would have been as productive as putting Sterling up front has been.

Balotelli and Borini have no business being up front for a Liverpool team wanting to get top 4. Lambert was only there for back up and his body is breaking down. So yes, our strikers are awful. For a replacement for a 31 goal Suarez, those 3 total players open goals combined don't stand up to Suarez's at all. 

This isn't just for you but I really hope everyone gets what I am saying. Our strikers and inadequate and Rodgers got dealt a bad hand. How is he supposed to get us in to top 4 when he's had 2 of his strikers ripped out of him and replaced by a Balotelli he didn't want, a Borini he didn't want, and a 33 year old backup striker in Lambert?",null,0,null,1432552727,null,0,1432553051,0,crk6k2p,null,t3_374kyu,null,t1_crk6k2p,null,t1_crjvelr,null,null,null,1433254494,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Thanks for doing the leg work with the numbers, but I've left room for it in my argument  mate. You've put in an awful lot of effort to be a sarcastic, but very little into comprehension.

NOBODY is saying Rodgers wanted Balotelli. Like you said, ""This isn't just for you but I really hope everyone gets what I am saying"". Rodgers had a choice, work with the cards he was dealt, or tank the season. He attempted to adjust our midfield and defense with 3 at the back, yet was stubborn on playing Balo and Lambert as if they were Sturridge or Suarez. Then he played Sterling like he was Lambert/Balo with those god awful crossing tactics. Oh and then he played Can like he was Johnson, when Johnson was in fine form and not even making the bench...

Boo hoo he didn't get the players. Rodgers got dealt a hand that every single manager barring those at Madrid/Barca/Bayern/PSG, has been dealt. There is literally no club owner that lets their managers get free reign over the transfers, because that's how you end up with Lovren + Lallana for 45m (both Rodgers transfers).Rodgers is a professional, and he came to the rational decision to play a short midfield and a false 9 against a Stoke team that has tall, physical CBs and two CDMs covering the hole that Lallana was in. 


If you know your history, you know the forwards Rafa had when he won the CL. Borini was literally the first player Rodgers came screaming for. Or was it Dempsey, or maybe Sigurrdson?

Getting Griezmann at the discounted price seems worthwhile, I would like to keep Oscar though and watch him develop given his age and massive potential. I think the competition for the 10 spot could apply some pressure and Griezmann could be flexible enough to play as a winger when we want both in at the same time. I'd offload Ramires and Mikel for as much as we can get. Also selling Cech even at veteran value gets us awfully close. 

Think its time to move on from the Cuadrado experiment to more of a sure bet in the EPL. I also love love William, but think that if I was to be as pragmatic and opportunistic I would cash in on his value now after a great tail-end of the season. Sell him and the underwhelming Filipe Luis so that we can make way for...Gareth Bale. Seems like a reasonable tradeoff.

Not included here is Rob Green who looks like a likely GK replacement for Cech. 

I'm more confident in Remy as a #2 striker after that last match - I'd like to see our #3 be a home grown youth project like Solanke or even Bamford.

☺. Still want a stop-gap for while Zouma continues to develop, but that can maybe happen next off-season. Our defense is generally aging but hugely productive this season so hesitant to change too much but surely an area to focus on in the years to come. 

*TL;DR:

SELL (-143): 
Willian (-50)
Mikel (-20)
Ramires (-25)
Luis (-15)
Cech (-8)
Cuadrado (-25)

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"Except the figures were wrong though. Balotelli didn't score 14 goals without penalties. Borini didn't score 10 without penalties. You never specified that.

If you think that when a manager categorically states that he didn't want a player and that he signs next week is a regular occurrence then be my guest. I never mentioned anything about managers getting a free reign, I would be against that. I know that managers have disagreements about the club with who to sign. But the sheer idiocy is that he never fitted into a Rodgers team, he never would and never will. How people can't see that is beyond me. 
I don't have a problem going with the continental method of buying players without the manager's consent. But I have a problem when it goes totally against what Rodgers wants. Rodgers wants a ball playing keeper and gets Mignolet. Rodgers wants a Bony/Sanchez, proven scorers who fit into what Rodgers wants, ends up with Balotelli and Lambert. 

This season, Rodgers has had to work with what he has got. And for the most part he has actually done very well. Sterling was the best replication of Sturridge, someone who works the channels and runs between the lines unlike Lambert and Balotelli who drop continuously and don't get in good positions. And actually, we're one of the lowest crossing teams in the whole season so that is wrong. 

All forwards Rafa brought were bought because he thought that they would fit into his system. That's simply not the case for Rodgers.

The only alternative options that weren't wheeled out yesterday were Hoilett, SWP and Kranjcar - would people really have been happier to see them in some alternative formation?

Ramsey might well turn out to be tactically clueless, naive and lack the charisma to instil loyalty and discipline, but I don't think we can make that call on the evidence available just yet.
