Let's be honest about where his talents lie: he's fast, he's pretty smart about timing runs, he's strong(er than people give him credit for), and he tends to work pretty hard. But his best quality is that he can look at a defender and get by them quickly enough in the final third. Yes, that's a great ability, but it doesn't make you a world beater without the acquisition of these other skills. At his age Ronaldo, Messi, even players like Rooney, were showing world class potential in their skill. They were more than the sum of their physical attributes.

I think there is a difference between 'caring about the fans' and belonging, or feeling that you belong to them. 

Do people really think Cech doesn't care about the fans..or have they just not put that much effort into thinking about it?

&gt;i know how good of a keeper Cech is and i'm not arrogant enough to say that they couldn't beat us in the season.

I know they could beat us. Anything can happen. That's sports. But I still think the odds are in our favor even if they acquire Cech.

You know he has been playing top football for awhile now? To think a ""sophomore"" slump is do is silly. Also, a different back up keeper will also push Courtois. After he was given the number one spot he never had to worry Cech was really going to take it from him. Yes Cech's expertise helped him learn and still would but it's not really going to put a dent in any of our goals to win trophies. I think Courtois has a great work ethic and is fully capable of pushing himself without another top five goal keeper pushing him. Its not like he has one of those pushing him his entire career and he managed before.


&gt;so is the whole team really, with the champions target on our backs and a harder-than-ever UCL group stage on the horizon. 

And Cech really wouldn't have been a part of achieving all that. A different back up keeper can do exactly what Cech was going to do. Sit on the bench.

Cech really won't add as much significance as you think. They still need a solid defense in front him. Yes he improves their goal keeping position. But I don't think he will be the thing that takes them over the top. 

&gt;Not with the view that it could maybe might be good because they will take points away from from teams, ignoring that they could very well beat teams that we won't as well as ourselves. 

I'm not ignoring anything. I'm aware it could go the opposite. But I still don't think they will win more games than us or finish ahead of us on the table.

Don't pull your shoulder reaching for that straw. Third logical fallacy of this conversation. And no it doesn't but the fact that terrorism is terrible does make those people against terrorism correct. 

&gt;You're are convinced that this is a good move, however you wont convince a single person of that sadly. 

I'm not convinced it's a good move. I'm just not convinced it's a bad one. It can bring many outcomes to next season. We have to sit and wait to find out. But to just assume it's only going to be terrible is a stupid way to think.

null,false,petethepool,null,null,null,"Raheem has so so much more to him than you're giving him credit for- his control, touch, ability to shield the ball, he can pick the ball up from deep, turn past a player, and can carry the ball confidently. He isn't the golden boy of the premier league- or of England. I understand everyone wants to make themselves feel better, but it isn't just the English tax that makes Raheem a £50m player- not only his stats but his footballing intelligence is comparable with all but the GOAT for his age. 

There's a reason Man City are paying £50m for Raheem, and Real Madrid, Bayrn etc. are interested, and a reason Man United chose to pursue Depay over Firmino. There's a reason he wasn't top priority for the other big clubs- it's because there are still doubts over him. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great signing, I'm excited. What him signing for Liverpool shows me too is that he's a smart guy, he knows he needs to play and prove himself still, and he knows Liverpool is a great place to do so.  He will be adored. 

If I had to chose I would keep Raheem - that is, I would have six months ago. Now though, Raheem can go fuck himself. He's shown he isn't so smart, and he has been so disrespectful to the club I don't care what happens to him. But purely on ability and potential growth, id have Raheem now over Firmino now.

Fans have no issues criticizing a player if they force a move out to a better club but somehow if the club forces a player out, the player is just supposed to somehow ""deal with it""?

Think about this from Cech's POV. He wanted to retire at Chelsea. This was his club and his own club has decided to replace him through no fault of his own. What good is it having all the adulation from fans - it hasn't helped him one whit in this instance (and won't in the future either). 

If you believe the club owes nothing to Cech because we paid him, then the reverse is also true. He owes us nothing because he performed for the money we gave him.

Sometimes things aren't meant to be through no fault of anyone. I think both the club and player understand this and I'm frankly quite proud at how the club has handled it.",null,0,null,1435127008,null,0,false,0,csgtalo,null,t3_3auzvz,null,t1_csgtalo,null,t1_csgnnug,null,null,null,1437305595,null,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9,null

null,false,Grigori7,english,London,null,"I am an assistant psychologist working in South East London. I work on an adolescent outreach team. I just want to say that the number of children I work with in desperate poverty has dramatically  increased in the last three years.

Children's social services in my team's area have had their funding cut by 26% since the conservatives came to lower. This means that each time I can access help for one child, I'm literally taking it away from another. We are holding on to children who no longer require psychological input because there's no other available service who can support them in escaping poverty. 

I routinely enter homes with whole families living in a single bedroom, mould covering the walls and ceiling. I've seen properties that Environmental Health declared unfit for habitation months ago still occupied because services have no resources available for rehousing these children.

I give out food bank access vouchers  to parents who are on benefits and parents who work. Neither can afford to live.

We have this bizarre rhetoric in this country where we think poverty is defined by the government as not having two TVs or something stupid like that. This is completely untrue. On the coalface we just want children to be warm, safe and well fed.

Children are suffering out there right now on a scale that most of us can't begin to imagine, and it's avoidable. Please,while these monstrous people are in power, donate to your local food bank, donate to the YMCA. Do whatever you can.

Yes. You and or your wife have domicile of origin in the UK (I assume), and if you decided to move to the US for a few years for work (for example) then you might still have domicile in the UK despite living in the US.

From [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domicile-set15/domicile-set15#set155-domicile-of-choice) about domicile of choice:
&gt; whether a person has made the claimed domicile of choice his / her home with the intention of establishing a family there and / or remaining there indefinitely (unless something happens to cause a change of mind).

So if she can successfully argue that you moved to the US but not with the intention to stay there indefinitely then UK might have jurisdiction.

What's happened is that due to it being the busy period for work (we deal with exams) they hire a lot of temps and add in extra shifts. When those started I ended up with the short straw as I had to work 7 days in a row (switched from 8 hours 5 days a week to 4 days of 12 with 4 days off). Now as the work is coming to an end and we go back to normal shifts, my last day off should be Tuesday. However, with them starting the shifts halfway through the week, and the general numptiness of the company, I'm expecting to be told to start Monday.

Already started planning my arguments for it, knowing my luck it'll end up as . So far the list of things I need to sort out are these two day, overtime pay for the 7 day week (48 hour week was no overtime, but I knew and agreed to that) and a possible missing 6 hours from my payslip, although that could be added to this months as the missing 6 happened on a night shift week.

Then of those who are applying for benefit the one's who are sucessful should be the the illest, these are the ones who hopefully are most likely to die. Yes there will be some cross overs where the death is entirely independent from the factors assessed in benefits, (like say accidents) which should be relatively small. Further many who will die will be outside of the work age benefits altogether, the elderly will most likely be the largest proportion of those dying and their pensions aren't up for assessment (though their pip/dla probably will be - they won't be declared fit for work from this though).

 Tl;dr

Those applying for benefits (of the work age population)&gt; more likely to die

Those not receiving benefits (of those who apply) &gt;if the system is working this should corelate quite strongly with those least likely to die, the argument is that it doesn't as well as it should. That's kinda the point.

26 pallets x 144 cases per pallet x 20 packs per case x 8 biscuits per pack = 599,000 biscuits.

Problem is this would be worth about £34k at retail (£0.45 per pack)

So the £12k figure is probably at cost rather than retail, which is what the insurance would pay out at.

Honestly I do not know why the police are not giving out the details of the stolen biscuits.  They will be in a Cash and Carry near you soon.  All that is needed is are the Batch numbers of the products and the police could trace them back.  Maybe they are just telling the wholesalers to be on the lookout.

Anyway look out for some cheap teatime treats in your corner shops for the next few weeks!

What if there's only one or two? Firstly there won't be imo but even if I'm wildly wrong and there was only one suicide due to sanctions over the last 12 months, that is still one too many. It's easy to sweep this under the carpet and act like the deaths were of less valuable members of society, but if you had a family member who was ill long-term, on benefits and struggling, then was sanctioned due to a mistake or quota and subsequently took their own life then I imagine that one death would be one too many.

Rumors of Enrique, Manquillo, Borini, Balotelli, Lambert on their way out. Who knows who will go and stay, figure Borini gone. Johnson's definitely gone. Flanagan had his serious injury/operation. 

Assuming Enrique, Manquillo and Flanagan (even for some of the season) are out of the picture, a fullback seems like an obvious choice.

Lucas is our only real DM, Can is too young and makes too many defensive errors to be a sole DM in my opinion, that with his knack for going forward and his distribution I don't see it happening much this season but I could be wrong. I'd rather see him getting forward.

Origi here for the season or out on loan again?

I'd like to see us cement the Clyne signing, but even then we're lacking depth in that department if Johnson, Enrique and Manquillo are on the way out. 

I think we should spend big on a striker if Sterling gets us the 50m. Maybe we can get the wheels turning on Aguero heading to Madrid and we pick up Benzema with the Sterling money. Then again, maybe I could sleep with Yvonne Strahovski.

Temporary barriers have been placed up (after 6 years when an off duty police office gets killed) to separate lanes forcing pedestrians onto dedicated crossings, although someone else still got hit 2 days later.

Finally 6 years on, Swansea council have realised it was a waste of money, and is an absolute dangerous road system not fit for purpose. Shame it'll cost more to undo, and that they spent plenty more on bus lanes last year but hopefully they'll be free to rejig the Kingsway without the bendy busses to make the roads safe for pedestrians again, and better flowing for traffic.

Shaving costs went from £20 every month or so, to a 6p blade every week - the DE razor itself was a simple Merkur 34C, £25 when I bought it.

I think some of it admittedly could be down to the products and method, as DE razors usually go along with nicer shaving soaps &amp; shaving with, across and then against the grain. I get nice shaving soaps from [Taylor of Old Bond St.](http://www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk) in London &amp; got the badger brush off Ebay.

I've just recently started cutthroat shaving, and haven't cut myself once! The shave isn't as close as a DE, but the skin feels so much better afterwards, and has completely got rid of all the ingrowing hair problem I had under my chin. That and it looks fucking awesome, feels so satisfying and injects your blood with pure manliness.

http://www.yellowstonepark.com/2011/06/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/

the short version : Beavers were thought to be extinct in the park. But when they reintroduced wolves, they noticed the beavers had returned. Doesn't make a lot of sense at first, wolves don't eat any beaver predators for the most part. But Elk populations in the park were huge and had few major predators till the wolves turned up, so they spent all of their time stood around eating plants - the same plants beavers needed to eat to survive winter.

once the wolves were reintroduced, they started hunting elk, they had to move around more, spent less time grazing on food, and the beavers could eat through winter again, so now the beavers are properly back.",null,0,null,1435135428,null,0,false,0,csgvjxb,null,t3_3axjed,null,t1_csgvjxb,null,t1_csgvg9e,null,null,null,1437540201,null,63,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,63,null

One problem for abolishing line rental is that many ISPs use it as additional profit. Even Virgin does this, and they don't have any technical need for a phone line at all. Virgin broadband on its own is almost as much as Virgin broadband + phone together. It's like £4 or 5 a month less, but not £15.

TalkTalk is the classic example of that, where they have ""£2 unlimited broadband"" but you must have the line rental with them. £2 on its own is not going to pay for the various costs of providing the service, so they make the rest up from the phone rental

I say ""In.die"". What we mean of course is Adam Balkan, is relocating himself because he personally didn't like the election result.

Eris are moving *to the US* for fuck's sake, where they can be served with a National Security Letter and be banned from speaking about any undue influence they receive from the USGov.

As far as Labour and Censorship go, Labour set the bar early with RIPA in 2000 (which requires you to divulge encryption keys when required). In 2006 they passed the Identity Cards Act with the intention of feeding all our personal data into the National identity Register (one database to rule them all). In 2007 they ratified EU Directives on Data Retention. They also passed provisions in their Terror Acts widening provisions regarding the seizure and search of computers and property (and well as random stop-and-search).

The Communications Data Bill was originally drafted in 2008 under Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith alongside the Interception Modernisation Programme. This is not a Tory thing. This is something which is being pushed very hard by Civil Servants at whichever government happens to be in power - Labour, Conservative or Coalition.

Specifically, it's emanating from the [Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Security_and_Counter-Terrorism), headed by an ex-MI6 guy called [Charles Farr]. It's pretty much his job to present an outrageous list of things he ""needs"" to politicians, and for the politicians to then whittle that list down to what they will allow him to have.

The Draft Data Bill 2008 was bumped and bounced around, Labour got booted out. The Tories *binned* it, and scaled back IMP, but resurrected parts of it in 2012, before putting it on the back-burner again. Basically, if they don't pass something, Charles Farr will just go back to the drawing board and come back 18 months later with a rewrite.

Some would paint this as ""nasty Tories are sitting round a table dreaming up these Orwellian restrictions"".

That simply isn't the case. They're getting a list of stuff the Security Services would like (and who are presumably providing some justification for needing - however flimsy), and deciding which new powers they will allow them to have.

In most people's opinion they are bending over too far for people who are distracted with what they *can* do rather than what they *should* do, but it's still *not some sinister Tory plot*.

&gt; the introduction of compulsory network filtering for new customers

Are you talking about the Porn Filter? Because whilst I share your disdain for an on-by-default, opt-out filtering system, opt-out still isn't ""compulsory"".

&gt; People are just reacting to the rumours because there's not a lot else to do in the summer, and so far the rumours around Chelsea don't look particularly promising in terms of improving the squad. Obviously September 1st is the time to really reflect on what has happened over the summer but like fuck am I waiting until then to comment.


As for the comments about having money, Mourinho knowing how to go from strength to strength etc, I'd just like to remind you of [this gem of a transfer window](http://i.imgur.com/vETR2ll.jpg) which followed Mourinho winning back to back titles. Chelsea wouldn't win another title until 2010. 


People are right to be concerned in my opinion, it has been a poor start to the summer, and to be honest there does seem to be a trend at the moment of Premier League winners resting on their laurels and failing to retain the title. *At the moment* it looks a bit like Chelsea will do the same.

null,false,rytlejon,lfc68,,null,"A few thoughts. To start off, I haven't really seen this guy play except for the few youtube compilations that have been thrown around here. But I'd like to make some points anyway about this signing.

One is an idea that was put forward in one of the later TAW-episodes. They mentioned how one player can have the power to elevate the rest of team by just showing how good he is in training (they mention Xabi Alonsos first training as an example). Potentially, Firmino could do this. He could show up, do some cool stuff in training, and raise the confidence of the squad, have them think ""this guy is the real deal, we have a good team here"".

Second, which is kind of close to the first point, he could be the guy who people look to in half time and think *""he's going to win the game for us""*, in the same way that people probably looked at Sturridge and Suarez - the player we lacked during this past season. This idea, that one player can win you the game, can make the team play more confidently (what we didn't do the past season). And hopefully, he's a bit more experienced, a bit more enthusiastic than Sterling, who was the closest we got to this player the past season. 

Third, this is a marquee signing. Even though I don't like the term, there is a point to it in that other players see that we're a club with ambitions, that we're aiming for top four and that we can attract talent. Signing Firmino simply makes us more attractive to other players who might've been put of by the bad season we've had.

Fourth, even though the price is higher than we thought before (probably closer to 30m than 20m), it's nice to see us being able to make good business in time. And it makes the people happy, which is really important. Even if he ends up sucking, we can always look back and say: at the time, it made a lot of sense.",null,0,null,1435141423,null,0,false,0,csgwvs8,null,t3_3ax8eb,null,t1_csgwvs8,null,t3_3ax8eb,null,null,null,1437308159,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

This transfers the title from the office of the Crown back to the person of the monarch (i.e. it actually would then be the private property of Charles or whoever).

However in reality Parliament has to drive this, the monarch has no say. The monarch isn't even monarch until Parliament passes a bill saying they are monarch. The bill recognising the new monarch will never be allowed to contain a provision dissolving the Crown Estates. At that point it is fait accompli.

Theoretically the monarch has power to dissolve the estate. However they can only exercise that power in the period between the death of the previous monarch and the passage of the bill recognising them as monarch.

**Here are the times we are obligated to call the police:**

1. When you are openly threatening a member of staff or another patient, and there is reason to suspect this is more than just psychosis and/or an empty threat.

2. When you have a quantity of drugs that is deemed genuinely unsafe to yourself or others. We get a LOT of latitude here.

3. When there is a court order (subpoena) that *forces* us to tell the police/courts, against our will, what has happened.

4. If you have been or are currently engaged in harming a child or children, such as if we discover evidence of your having molested a child in the course of making you better.

In these situations, we have no choice but to involved the police. However, as often as we possibly can we'll attempt to keep the police as far away as possible. If you're suffering from an overdose of an illegal drug, or we detect/are told about illegal drugs in your system, you are completely safe from prosecution. 

100% of the time, we would rather you came to the hospital and were honest about what was happening. We want you to come to the hospital, and if you're scared of the police you won't do that, so we keep the police out of it for as long as possible.

Now, if you're *discovered* by the police after having overdosed in public, for example, that might be a different matter. However, if you take yourself or a friend to hospital, or you call for an ambulance and state there are drugs on the premises, we will NOT call the police.

If you overdose on drugs, or suffer harm after taking drugs, please call an ambulance. We don't judge, and all we want to do is help you.

The reason we haven't heard anything? The same reason we haven't about Sterling even though that's almost certainly been agreed now. The club might be waiting for FFP to be officially relaxed or possibly announcing all 3 players at the same time.

Obviously I'm more focussing on the Sidwell, Pizarro, Boulahrouz, who were sub par squad players... Sound at all similar to what we've been linked with this summer? With the resources we had available to us we should have dominated the Premier League but instead due to poor squad management we conceded the title to United three years running. 


I'm not saying we're doomed, but I am saying that people have a right to be concerned about complacency. I'd rather be Bayern Munich 11/12 who despite being Champions League runners up went out and spent big leading to winning the treble the following season than Man City 13/14 who win the Premier League title and then make no significant upgrades to their starting 11/squad and have a poor season.

null,false,Taure,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"&gt;which is not owned by the monarch but by the Crown.

You're going to have to be more specific than this. ""Ownership"" does not exist as a legal concept. There is an immense variety of different legal rights which can be held over property, and the colloquial concept of ""ownership"" does not correspond to any one of them specifically. Different entities can simultaneously hold separate rights over the same property.

One key division of property rights is the separation of legal and equitable rights. The Monarch does not hold legal rights to the Crown estate, but they do hold equitable rights to it. That is what is meant when it is said that the Monarch is the beneficiary and that the owner of legal title (the Crown Estate) is a trustee. The holder of the equitable, beneficial interest is entitled to the incomes but not control of the capital.

You are right to say that the Monarch cannot alter the Crown estate. That is because they are not the holder of legal title. This does not mean, however, that the Monarch does not possess property rights to the Crown Estate. They do, they have equitable rights to it. Equitable rights have precedence over legal rights: the Monarch cannot control the Crown Estate, but their rights qua beneficiary are superior to the rights of the legal title holder. The legal holder of the property (the trustee) must control the property so as to benefit the beneficiary. If they fail to do so, the beneficiary can remove them for breach of trust and appoint another trustee in their place.

Legal title remains vested in the Crown Estate all the time. It is never transferred to and from the Monarch. What is transferred at the beginning of each reign is the right to the **incomes** of the Crown Estate, not the legal title to the capital. The right to the incomes is the equitable, beneficial interest. What the Monarch is doing, when they hand over the incomes of the Crown estate at the start of their reign, is passing the equitable interest in the property from the Monarch to the government. The legal title remains vested in neither the Monarch or the government, but in the Crown Estate.

A beneficiary can, under certain circumstances, compel the dissolution of a trust and the transfer of legal title to them, so that they hold both legal and equitable interests. However, once the Monarch assigns their beneficial interest to the government, they are no longer the beneficiary, and can no longer do this. This is why the Monarch's only chance to take legal title of the Crown Estate is at the start of their reign, when the equitable interest reverts to the new Monarch (as outlined by the instrument which assigns the beneficial interest to the government for the life of the Monarch). Once they've assigned their interest away for their lifetime, they can't get it back.

Of course, Parliament can pass any Act they like altering the law, because they have legislative supremacy. But as the law stands, this is the state of affairs.

Incidentally, this is not true:

&gt;The monarch isn't even monarch until Parliament passes a bill saying they are monarch. 

The fact that the UK Crown passes immediately on the death of the previous monarch is one of the key features of the UK monarchy which distinguishes it from continental monarchies where the Crown passes on Coronation. This doctrine developed in response to numerous succession disputes and is summarised in the phrase ""The King is Dead, Long Live the King!""

As you are doing Science it'll be slightly different however, I found it to be quite a gradual introduction and then by Christmas I was well into it and pretty stressed. In certain subjects I was really quite challenged, yet in others I wasn't. It is all subjective and dependant on you as a person but you will certainly have moments where you question your motives of embarking on the course.


From a non-science perspective, I was able to maintain 20-25 hours per week of employment and still do reasonably well (27 at Distinction 27 at Merit). I, and just like many others on my course, felt that the last few months were really intense and we had a mountain of work to complete. It is testing and a few people do drop out but stick with it because it's worth it in the end.


Your funding would most likely be specific to your college. For me, because my earnings were below a particular threshold and I didn't have a previous Level 3 qualification I was entitled to a reduced fee. Although I believe that the cost of the course is now far greater than what it was when I completed it. Funding and finance is generally sorted before you start, at the enrolment stage, and they would probably expect your fees to be paid or sorted out by the end of your first term.


I know that there are some issues when it comes to different kinds of benefits and my College were great at looking after those that had potential problems. There was a guy in my group who was on JSA and had a job offer and the tutors allowed him to complete the remainder of the course from home and just send in his assignments - but this was at the tail end of the course.


Look at student accounts, as you are able to open one as an Access student. I think Lloyds is one of the only banks that do. You would also be eligible for a reduced council tax bill as you're a student. Both of these things you would need to get a letter from the college saying you study there. I think the council tax is a bit of a grey area, as you need to study full time hours to qualify. However, my college seemed to think that the hours spent studying at home as well as contact hours made it up to the qualifying level.


I'm no expert on JSA or benefits, but a quick cursory browse of https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility shows that you must work less than 16 hours. I wouldn't have thought that this would also include studying, definitely check with your advisor though.

If you were to transfer a third of the police, transport or health budgets directly to education and training, you may have a greatly skilled group of workers. But as business will be risky and difficult due to poor infrastructure, poor health or high crime, those people will find it difficult to find work which meets those abilities. So they will move abroad and become a tax payer elsewhere. It's no use to us if we pay to train people up, only for them to become a benefit to someone else. Many countries are suffering from ""brain drain"" as it is.

It's inevitable in any system administering care for 00,000s of people. Not that it should be accepted - we should always strive for as low as possible, but the number being &gt;0 is also not a reason in itself to tear up the book and start again.

Your source states that the off-flow from support in 2010/11 was 728,740, of which 1300 represents 0.17%. Is that a high figure? I don't know, but it needs to be viewed in relation to the social care provisions of other countries, which no one seems to be chasing (and which I suspect we would do rather well against). 1300 sounds a lot, but without context it has no meaning. Thirteen hundred from ten thousand? A million? A billion?

**Secondly**, it's not just a fair point. It is **the** point, and a perfect demonstration of why the government doesn't want to release these figures - because they know the Daily Heil, and innumerates will abuse and manipulate them.

What you did up there was either grossly negligent or grossly dishonest. Do you realise that?

You stated:

&gt;10,600 people died between January and November 2011, so I'd wager the updated figures are way higher than just double. 

Clearly trying to suggest that many of these were unnecessary deaths down to poor benefits and social care. It wasn't until someone challenged you for your source and dug through the statistics that the *relevant* figure of 1300 was unearthed, not 10600. You inflated the figure by **an order of magnitude**. Worse yet, 70% of those people were taken off that benefit and moved onto a **higher** level of care! How awful for them! What sort of nasty evil government would move people onto **higher** levels of care?

null,false,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt; The fact that the UK Crown passes immediately on the death of the previous monarch is one of the key features of the UK monarchy which distinguishes it from continental monarchies where the Crown passes on Coronation. This doctrine developed in response to numerous succession disputes and is summarised in the phrase ""The King is Dead, Long Live the King!""

It is a legal fiction. A person isn't king until parliament says they are king. At that point it is effectively backdated to the moment the previous monarch died. However they naturally cannot wield any power in this fictitious period in which they were but weren't king. Indeed this set up is designed to weaken the monarch rather than strengthen them. It means any decision made by parliament in the interrim (such as the decision to choose said monarch) is legally binding since legally they were monarch before singing the bill that made them monarch. If it were not so then parliament couldn't pick who the king was.

As for ownership. The Crown Estates do not follow any of the normal modes of ownership in the UK. They are a very unique and distinct form of ownership closer to allodial title than a free hold. Even so ownership is precisely in the office of the monarch and not the person. If the person held any form of ownership of their own then there'd be an ownership contest should parliament do something like force a monarch to abdicate in favour of his brother. Parliament can make whoever they want king and that person would inherit whatever rights the current monarch has towards the Crown Estates.",null,0,null,1435147251,null,0,1435147563,0,csgyf17,null,t3_3axcvq,null,t1_csgyf17,null,t1_csgxpfd,null,null,null,1437309120,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

The tabloids and Private Eye seem to be able to find evidence for the failings of these companies. You won't provide any evidence of their successes.

The silence is damning.

&gt; Ignorance is knowledge, now? I've worked for both. 

Ah, vested interests at work.

&gt;  No, I'm not going to break confidentiality agreements just because you want to pretend you're informed - but the stuff you've seen in the papers is a drop in the ocean of work they've done that has generally gone pretty well (but won't sell any papers as a result).

It's breaking an NDA to say what a company did for a public sector organisation - you know, fairly public knowledge? I'm sure someone at Serco would have been fired for revealing that they ran Cornwall's out of hours NHS service - truly confidential information. It's not as if it was on the sign for their office or anything.

Saying ""yes they do lots of good things, I won't tell you what, but you should believe me"" is a useless argument.

&gt; ...and they're representative of the norm, are they? Have a look at how many councils they cover, and what their budgets are (just for a start). Then start on the NHS. Seriously, go comment on the DM website if you just want confirmation of what you think you already 'know'.

Well, they are diverse areas in which they've failed massively. Not sure why you're bringing up the Daily Mail.

He's the level of quality that we absolutely need right now, but we need 3-4 players on this level (and we've signed 2 already with Milner and Firmino).

What is really encouraging is that we got in early, paid what we needed to pay, and got a deal done for once.  We've missed out for what seems like pretty silly bullshit so many times in the past few seasons that it's felt like it would be impossible to get a player like this.  The fact we've grabbed him so early in the window and with such a quick and clean negotiation is a big deal, it sends a really nice message that we're fucking serious this time out, that we mean business.

Right now as far as I know Uber has relatively few barriers to becoming a driver.

Driving cabs is quite a sensitive sector, due to things like rape or dangerous driving, and the perception is that someone bad intentioned or irresponsible could get a job with uber and pose as a trusted employee but act recklessly, as they can just disappear onto something else easily.

If the Uber driver had made a career commitment to driving, there is less likely hood of them going off the map... so to speak.

Has it? In absolute figures, yes, individual cases have come to light.

Indeed without individual case histories it's unlikely you could ever be sure, and case histories are confidential).

1. a. Property checks. A good agent should do them without fail every three months. This is your number one safeguard against problems (which do happen) going from bad to worse to irreparable damage (which doesn't need to happen). 

  b. As an extension of this (this is the part that may sound self-serving!), can you tell how the agency is treating their staff? Are they always available at lunchtimes, or sat at their desks/sending you emails at 7pm? Property management is an immensely stressful job, as you are essentially a mediator between tenant and landlord. You are dealing with people on highly sensitive subjects of money, privacy, peoples homes, their livelihoods, conditions that may even be affecting their sleep, their kids or their health. And because it's sales, they will have the added pressure of targets and being pushed by management to drive for new lets/instructions. Lunch is unheard of in most agencies. Under harsh management, admin can get overlooked, contractor invoices go unpaid, relationships break down, there are just endless potential stressors within the business. I have seen several cases where this causes neglectful or completely missed property checks (crucial), and/or poor relations with tenants, which in turn leads to higher eviction rates = more repeat fees. If agents/PMs are being pushed by their managers, it will result in lacking landlord care, which is the crux of the whole process. 
2. Contractor relations &amp; process - for repairs, the landlord should always be provided with three contractor quotes, and given the power to select. Bonus points for agencies that have known their contractors for several years and can guide you on this process rather than telling you to pick the cheapest. Many agencies make a small percentage on contractor costs - I think it's standard practice but worth noting.

Of course they can, because the companies involved screwed up - but some failings &lt;&gt; a company failing, especially ones of the sizes we're talking about. Have you stopped using the NHS, for example?

&gt;you won't provide any evidence of their successes.

That's because you're not reading properly, or rather looking for flaws instead of using comprehension. Look at the budgets they have, the number of councils (alone) they cover, and how long they've been doing it for. I'm not saying anywhere that they've never screwed anything up, but it's significant that I've already pointed this out and yet you're still on a roll based on...er...

&gt;The silence is damning.

Oh, and I thought that was where you were busy reading up on the subject instead of asserting (on a public board) that a few examples somehow makes you an expert that doesn't need to do any further reading.

&gt;Ah, vested interests at work.

Having worked for someone makes them a vested interest for any ex-employee that signed a NDA? Good luck with that.

&gt;It's breaking an NDA to say what a company did for a public sector organisation

Sure, they just make you go through SC clearance for a laugh, right? But what the hell, I'll take that chance because an internet expert with zero experience knows better. Not. Go do your own research, only one of us is basing their summary on second-hand information with huge gaps in it *and then pretending that doesn't matter*. Comedy gold :-)

&gt;you know, fairly public knowledge? 

I see your experience in this is as thorough as your summaries.

&gt;I'm sure someone at Serco would have been fired for revealing that they ran Cornwall's out of hours NHS service

I'm not giving out details of stuff I've built that's still live and that I signed docs not to talk about - that includes any associated systems I have knowledge of at other sites too - but if you'd already done the maths on the budgets, sites and length of service Capita has at each one (which you're free to go find at least the last two bits of out for yourself), you wouldn't need me to anyway.

It's not like the tabloids/ PE/ etc. will have given you any information other than that which was needed to sell news/ outrage/ etc.

&gt;Well, they are diverse areas in which they've failed massively.

Which means they must have failed massively at everything they've done or are doing, right? Get some scale/ perspective of what you're talking about - once you've sorted out your private medical insurance (because the NHS have failed all over the place - they must be rubbish across the board as well, at least following your tabloid logic)

&gt;Not sure why you're bringing up the Daily Mail.

Because you're using the same logic that they do, to a frightening degree. And now you appear to be asserting that you don't even recognise you're doing it, which is...impressive.

&gt;I'm not sure what your point was.

Addressing your comment about notifying people that they haven't paid a license fee (and how it's actually quite important if you remember that 'public service' means just that).

&gt; I was attempting to be generous to Crapita by pointing out that they can post letters to suspected criminals (i.e. everyone without a TV licence)

No, you were listing a very small part of what they do as if that's all they're capable of. Really, go do some FOI research. I'm not doing it for you :--)

The city is lovely. My choice of Bath was driven by the city, and the big swimming pool.. Turns out the uni was pretty good academically as well, but the first thing that got my attention was the city! 

Very easy to get around, regular bus services between both Universities, the center of town, and the common student housing areas... Although I almost exclusively walked when I was there... It's a small city, and you'll only really find transport a problem if you need to move a lot of things with you... For that my housemates and I used to make an expedition across town to the supermarket with hiking rucksacks, however now it appears the fashion is to order home delivery shopping... 

Campus is a typical small/medium campus university... Has a range of shops (small supermarket, including a well stocked Asian specialty section), cafes, bars etc. You can live quite happily up on the campus if you want, and the grounds are usually well kept and a pleasant place to be. Has a doctors and dentists surgery very close as well, as well as Banks, book shops etc., very rarely would you absolutely *need* to head into town if you didn't want to!

There are thousands and thousands of international students in Bath, as well as thousands and thousands of tourists... You absolutely 100% will not stick out. 

Best tips would be try not to stick on the campus too much! Can be tempting to stay up there with the International Student community (a lot of them stuck with eachother), but the ones who seemed o have the best experience were the ones that got involved with a load of societies/clubs and ventured out into town! You can get far too sheltered living up on campus, and you've not lived until you've had a big dirty Sulis Pizza at silly o'clock in the morning after kicking out time at XL (the worst/dirtiest club in Bath by a long way)...",null,0,null,1435150114,null,0,false,0,csgzgkk,null,t3_3axw81,null,t1_csgzgkk,null,t3_3axw81,null,null,null,1437540088,null,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4,null

I'm merely asking someone who made the assertion that these companies have successes, to provide examples.

&gt; Sure, they just make you go through SC clearance for a laugh, right?

Oh my sides! Is refuse collection now a national security issue? rofl. Do the bin men have access to top secret information?

And the other is making wild claims without providing a shred of evidence, and trying to hide behind the excuse of security clearances to avoid doing so.

It's generally accepted that the person making the assertion provides the evidence, rather than telling others to find it out. You said that they've done good work, tell us what it is, or shut up

Again, you are refusing to provide any evidence of Crapita and friends not being a steaming pile of shite, so perhaps you'd stop trying to suggest it?

The only people who will ever be punished by a stricter system are the most vulnerable who can't fight their own corner. It makes me really sick, honestly.

General CV tips.

- No more than two sides of A4 - I don't have time to read your life story.
- Keep things relevant - I don't need to know about your cycling proficiency test.
- Spell cheque your CV, and get someone else to read it.
- Don't just say what you did - explain how you did it and what the result was.  Give numbers  E.g. In order to reduce waste, I investigated several new stock rotation system. We reduced waste by 15% over 3 months.
- Don't say things like ""I am a team player"" - give examples of when you've worked in a team.
- Leave off the ""hobbies and interests"" section.  You like watching movies and playing football? Congratulations! You're just like everyone else on the planet.  Only put on relevant information.  E.g. If you're applying to be a life-guard, mention your swimming certificate.
- Tailor the CV to the job.  Ok, if you're applying to both Tesco &amp; Lidl, you can probably use the same one - but generally speaking, tweak it for each application.
- Don't put on your age, gender, religion, father's profession. Don't include a photo of yourself.  Get a sensible email address, not the ""sexymilflover69woofwoof@hotmail.com"" one you thought was funny at school.  And, yes, I've seen example of all these on CVs!
- Don't give up!  It's hard to get a job these days.  You'll get there - but you might need to recalibrate your expectations.

as a lower rate payer that is at least £1.20 for every £1 you put in. If you have employer, that makes it £2.20 for every £1 you put in up to their contribution limit.

as a higher rate payer with contribs, you can get £2.40 for every £1
as a top rate payer with contribs,, you can get £2.45 for every £1 you put in.

if your employer does a 'salary sacrifice' pension scheme you can get even more as they put in your NI payments (12% on top) - at my last employer it cost me £63 a month from my pension , for £225 a month to go into the pot.

so the pension will cost you far less to invest into, regardless of the investment gains. 

the correct answer imo is that you should do both. Put pension contributions in with the aim to have a decent income (personally i'm aiming for 20k/year assuming I have my own house somewhere by then), and then put the rest into the S&amp;S ISA.

&gt; So surpluses aren’t normal—even during good times—because a core role of the government is to be one of the three sources of the growing money supply that a growing economy needs. This is especially true for countries like the USA and the UK that are running sustained balance of payments deficits, since the only way then to combine a government surplus with a growing economy is for private borrowing from banks to go through the roof. That can work for a while—and make the government look like a “good economic manager” for those naïve enough to believe that governments should run surpluses. But it will end in tears, because the real cause of the apparent “good economic times” is a private debt bubble.
&gt; 
&gt; Cameron’s claim that it’s fiscally responsible to run a surplus “during normal times” is thus a fallacy.

[""A business owner does not have to sell anything to anyone. If he wants to refuse service he can, by simply not entering into the contract.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/3axt42/what_are_the_age_limits_for_pubs/csgzmpt)

[""It only becomes discrimination under the Equality Act if a contract has been entered into then broken due to one or more protected characteristics of the buyer - e.g. that gay wedding cake fiasco.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/3axt42/what_are_the_age_limits_for_pubs/csgz823)

You've since reversed your position and started arguing that yes, a business can commit illegal discrimination by refusing service but that an under-21/25 rule is not such discrimination (although your reasoning on that is shaky too).

I could see this lineup being used. The squad core is used to this formation. Firmino plays as a striker to the left, where most of his goals and assists came from last season. This allows Coutinho to play in his preferred position.

In midfield you have Can and Hendo on opposite sides, both thriving as hard working box-to-box midfielders. They will need to put a proper shift in defence together with Lucas, who sits behind, in order to cover for the wingbacks who will be caught in attack occasionally. Having three hard working midfielders in defence might be a solution to Liverpools poor defensive record.

Wingbacks are necessary for this formation to work, since there is little width. For this Moreno is good. He will push up and provide lots of force and necessary width in attack. He will still have to develop his defensive skills a lot. On the other side we need another good fullback. Someone who can give support and width in attack yet still be stable in defence. This will be our next transfer target.

Not to say this doesn't often happen to male prisoners also, but simply that it's almost a dead certainty for women on lengthy remand.

Some may like to trumpet about inequality, but the fact is that female prisoners cannot be treated like male prisoners. The bias is warranted when you see the vastly greater impact incarceration tends to have on women.

Their network back haul is also split between BT and TalkTalk; neither of which are particularly sterling networks. BT is over subscribed and TalkTalk is flaky. Ultimately their support boils down to being able to log onto your local MSAN and check attenuation levels and whether your CHAP username is correct. They control fuck all of the network, but are just prepared to share your line's particular frame loss rate. There's barely any difference between them and Gregs The Baker ISP or some other firm that leases their entire network from others.

They're too tight to even provide an IPv4 network to users, just a single IPv4 and a few trillion IPv6. Their sales people don't want your business either. Last time I was with them, they'd just give one-word answers to service queries.

As for the line, it's your regular copper pair (although if it's currently with a wholesale/non-wholesale ISP - they fail to clarify, they'll want to run a new copper pair in for a few £100). It has a slightly different tone down it so Openreach engineers don't think the line is dead, but no voice service.

Point is that all of our main targets are still here, I'm not too concerned to see Firmino and Kondogbia go and I'm actually happy that we won't get Wilshere as he's simply far too injury prone imo.

Even TalkTalk is still beholden to BT when we're talking about FTTC/FTTP (except in York of course) since it's all through Openreach DSLAMs and OLTs, and you'll get exactly the level of control and monitoring BT wants you to have.

I otherwise agree though. A&amp;A are technically competent, but they are well overhyped for what they are - who cares about the important things like price, when you claim you're compliant with some XKCD comic and you have support in an IRC channel. Or that filtering thing. Yes, they don't filter, but neither do most of the smaller ISPs because the government isn't leaning on them.

I consider myself competent in networking and have a rough idea of the Openreach/BT Wholesale/ISP relationship, but I fear if I joined them I'd get treated like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxQqWSnsHoA)

I tried playing with their order form and they want something like £60 a month for 80/20 FTTC with 300GB of usage and a phone line. Why would I go there when I can get the same quality of service from someone like Zen for much less? (you can have all the IPv4 you want, though no IPv6 support through Zen unfortunately)

The BT 21CN seems lightyears ahead of the old network. I've had no issues at all performance wise since getting FTTC, but I remember having to get my ISP to push BT really hard to fix backhaul issues at the local exchange with IPstream

&gt; As for the line, it's your regular copper pair (although if it's currently with a wholesale/non-wholesale ISP - they fail to clarify, they'll want to run a new copper pair in for a few £100). It has a slightly different tone down it so Openreach engineers don't think the line is dead, but no voice service.

So how does that compare in cost to an actual phone line via A&amp;A? I tried looking briefly on the website but I couldn't find any info on it

edit: ""We can provide a copper pair specially for broadband for £12 pcm. Installing a new copper pair is £60†.""

I pay £15 to Zen for a real phone line I think. It's still cheaper to go with Zen overall

&gt; A&amp;A is the Simpson's Comic Book Guy in ISP form. You can get a much better service from Zen Internet. For half the price you can get a /29 network from Zen and not have to deal with a company that collectively has Aspergers Syndrome.

It also troubles me that one Lord admitted (I do not have the quote to hand) they like to hear individual stories and experiences. In one case this was about a terminally ill child who benefited from cannabis and another it was about a grandmother who was scared of a headshop.

Whilst stories may be touching it is statistics and broad evidence, not anecdote that should dictate these decisions.

null,false,ny-batteri,null,null,null,"First piece of advice I would give is to ignore posters who tell you to avoid certain areas. There's a trope doing the rounds on this sub that places like east Belfast (for the most part quiet suburbs with great restaurants) are xenophobic hellholes. I even saw someone claiming that Holywood (one of NI's richest, most cosmopolitan and socially liberal areas) would be a bad place for someone with a southern accent to go. If you're really unsure of somewhere, go in the daytime, and have a look around. There are only a handful of areas where you are likely to come to any harm, and they are smaller than in other equivalently sized cities.

As to your specific questions:

1. If you're in the student area, Stranmillis or the upper parts of the Lisburn Rd are the nicest. Expect to pay £220-250/month in shared accomodation. £450+ for a single flat.  Prices will generally be higher than what you're accustomed to in Canada. Buses are ok, fairly regular and cover the main arterial routes. £2 for a single journey or you can buy weekly/monthly passes which will make it cheaper. If you're feeling brave, you can cycle, but exercise caution as our drivers are not particularly considerate.

2. A pint will cost somewhere around £3.50. Craft beers are becoming increasingly popular, and there are a couple of bars in the south Belfast area that cater specifically to this market (Woodworkers and Brewbot). I think Harp, the local lager, tastes like chilled, lightly carbonated pish, but ymmv. Hilden Breweries do a couple of nice beers, as do Whitewater, but it's more common to see them bottled than on tap. 

3. Yes.

4. There is (or was, haven't been in a while) an exhibit on the Troubles in the Ulster Museum. It was fairly neutral and uninformative. You might find taking a black taxi tour interesting. The best thing to do is to get a wide range of views. Narrative construction is a burgeoning industry here, so treat single viewpoints with caution.

5. Expect people to be sarcastic and quite insulting with you. This is part of bonding. In more public spheres, you'll find we're (like Canadians) quite polite, and apologise for things like being bumped into. People from here like to think they're friendly, which they are in a sense (certainly, there's a genuine warmth) but compared to many other cultures people here are actually quite reserved until you get to know them.

6. Not really a touristy place. There's the Titanic museum, which is actually quite a bit better than I expected, but otherwise there's not much to avoid. Watching confused tourists wander around the city centre before 1 on a Sunday can be amusing, though, as the shops don't open and there's very little to actually do.

No he didnt. He played as a left forward both games he played with neymar at the Copa, one as a sub vs Peru and the game against Colombia. The game with Colombia, which I may add, he didn't really create any chances nor did he drop back to get the ball much. Not sure what game you watched. Neymar dropped back quite a bit to get the ball, Neymar was playing in behind him if anything. If you look at Firmino's heat map you'll see he was the most forward player for Brazil. Honestly not sure what you watched or what article you read bc Firmino was not playing in behind Neymar at all. They were kinda of overlapping in terms of positioning but Firmino was mostly acting as and out and out striker while Neymar had the ball on the wing, which he did for most of that game. The Venezuela game it was basically the same but with Robinho instead of Neymar. Not sure what you watched or where you got your information from...

[Source](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts/overview)

&amp;nbsp;

1. Are you referring to only the first £100 in interest being tax-free? If so this only applies to normal Child Savings Accounts (assuming an R85 form has been filled out). Child ISAs are exempt from this.

2. I agree this should only apply to a relatively small number of people considering the requirements to even open an ISA. I also believe, or at the very least hope, that anyone with multiple citizenship or residencies across multiple jurisdictions should have already consulted a tax professional to get their affairs in order. This is especially the case for US citizens &amp; residents who have lived anywhere not in the USA.

3. The Corporation Tax view is an odd one. Dividend income (post-Corporation Tax) is tax free in an ISA for everyone but is tax free for Basic Tax Payers anyway. There is some confusion with Dividend Coupons and the Dividend Tax Credit but these should pretty much always directly cancel each other out. HMRC even advises people to focus on the actual dividend amount when working out the tax due and to ignore the higher value on the coupon and the tax credit.

null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"He has potential, sure. But right now he isn't *really* a major upgrade on our existing defenders.

As a left back, he's passable. Sort of like a Cissokho with better technique (when he feels like it). He gets away with more in Italy in terms of positioning than he would in England, though, and Cissokho's defensive positioning seems better, IMO.

As a centre back? For Villa? No. Just no. Maybe at another club he could be effective, but I don't think we have the environment he will need to flourish.

Let me break it down a bit.

Much like the rest of our defenders, he seems to kind of *need* an experienced leader to work with and get him in the right places doing the right things (as good as he is at organising, Senderos is pretty much our only option there; marinate on that for a second) ... this is mainly because his marking and positioning appear to be pretty poor, and that's in a generally slower league. Can he handle the pace of the Premier League?

Well.. in theory, yes. He's an exceptional athlete. In that sense, he's sort of like Okore. But older. He sort of relies on his athleticism to cover up his mistakes re: positioning, and that's a problem because, unlike Okore, Ogbonna seems sort of lazy. He also has semi-frequent lapses that for Juve are typically costly such as this spell of [ballwatching against Olympiacos](http://gfycat.com/PopularSelfishIberianlynx) and his [""pathetic"" attempt at defending against Fiorentina](https://twitter.com/agiamba/status/573630505956016128). Those two incidents have not endeared him to *Juventini*. At all. Though admittedly, Juve fans aren't the most... lenient... of supporter groups. Also, Sherwood could perhaps motivate him to bust his ass every game. Seems like a bit of a gamble, though.

I mean, don't get it twisted. I don't dislike the guy, and I think given a bit of time alongside a strong leader, he could be a very good defender (he looked solid for Torino, after all)... but right now, I find it hard to believe he would be a significant enough immediate upgrade for the fee (at least 5-6m you'd reckon) so... in my mind, he's just not worth it...

I'm also a Juve fan, for what it's worth. And I'd not be too upset about him leaving Juve. Take from that what you will.",null,0,null,1435156714,null,0,false,0,csh2sgz,null,t3_3arsh7,null,t1_csh2sgz,null,t3_3arsh7,null,null,null,1437312021,null,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1,null

If she was in a family unit with him when she fled Sudan, he is entitled to come here under the [family reunion provisions](https://www.gov.uk/settlement-refugee-or-humanitarian-protection/family-reunion). I would strongly recommend using a good quality solicitor to make the application, the factual case presented to the Home Office must be absolutely watertight. If they find a gap, or if there is any inconsistency, they will probably refuse the application. The *main* requirements that have to be fulfilled are in Immigration Rule 352D:

352D. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in order to join or remain with the parent who is currently a refugee granted status as such under the immigration rules in the United Kingdom are that the applicant:
(i) is the child of a parent who is currently a refugee granted status as such under the immigration rules in the United Kingdom; and
(ii) is under the age of 18, and
(iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and
(iv) was part of the family unit of the person granted asylum at the time that the person granted asylum left the country of his habitual residence in order to seek asylum; and
(v) would not be excluded from protection by virtue of article 1F of the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees if he were to seek asylum in his own right; and
(vi) if seeking leave to enter, holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity.

Your friend should consider how she will *prove* this information. It is relatively unusual for there to be a significant gap between grant of refugee status and the application for reunion. A delay raises a suspicion that either the son is not genuinely hers, or was not in her family unit when she left. How did they live in Sudan? Why could he not flee with her? How come the relatives moved without leaving contact details? Why would her son not have electronic communication details for her that he could use wherever he ended up? Why would he attempt the perilous journey to Greece if he could contact her? Why (and how) has contact been re-established? You shouldn't delay, but when you contact a legal representative you should have all the information and evidence to have. As her friend, think of her case suspiciously. Play devil's advocate.

 [**2015 Greek football scandal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%20Greek%20football%20scandal): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __2015 Greek football scandal__ emerged on 6 April 2015 when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas' 173-page work was revealed. [Telephone tapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_tapping) operated by the [National Intelligence Service of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_Service_(Greece\)) since 2011 has played a significant role in the case.  According to the prosecutor's conclusion, [Olympiakos F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiakos_F.C.) owner [Evangelos Marinakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos_Marinakis) along with [Greek Football Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Football_Federation) members Theodoros Kouridis, and Georgios Sarris are suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011. The goal behind their scheme was to ""absolutely control Greek football's fate by the methods of blackmailing and fraud"",       exploiting the self-governing (""autonomy"") status of national football federations promoted by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) and [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA). Referees, judges, football directors and chairmen are also involved in the scandal. All defendants deny charges. [Olympiakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiakos_F.C.) are the champions of the [Greek Superleague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superleague_Greece) at the time.

Tax relief gives you back what is yours. If I as the government take 20% from your £1, then I now have 20p and you have 80p. If I give you back 20% then you get 20% of 80p bringing you to 96p. The government would still have 4p.

Tax relief acts as if the original 20% deduction never took place, so you keep your £1.

If I take 40% from you, you're left with 60p. Giving 40% back would mean you'd only have 84p and I'd still have 16p. 

So tax relief means the 20% figure becomes 25% and the 40% figure becomes 66%. 

That's before you add in employer contributions that you don't get if you choose to reject the pension.

Bogdan was a decent purchase for me. He's actually a better keeper than people give him credit for and is a lot lot better than Brad Jones. Only worry I have is if Mignolet picks up an injury would Bogdan really be good enough. But you could say that about a lot of our players in different positions. Saying that Bogdan is more than good enough to be a backup and I am happy with the goalkeeper situation.

**Liberalism and conservatism are not mutually exclusive**. You can be both conservative (right wing) and liberal. They are not opposite. 

The opposite of conservativism is, depending on context, **progressivism^1** (opposite of social conservativism) or **socialism^2** (opposite of economic conservativism).

The opposite of liberalism^3 is **authoritarianism^4**.

Examples of the above:

^1 Green Party

^2 TUSC, SSP

^3 Liberal Democrats

^4 Nazi Party

UKIP are liberal conservative.
Labour are authoritarian socialist.

Most Brits simply don't interact with international students, so don't think much about them. Generally people's attitude is very relaxed. Some areas have real social problems that correlate with hostility to all outsiders, but Bath is famously wealthy so this shouldn't be a problem at all.

I'm guessing you're Singaporean or Malaysian Chinese. Lots of Singaporeans and Malaysians tend to cluster together. But you can actually integrate more easily than anyone else except Aussies/Kiwis if you want to make the effort. I had a Malaysian mate at uni; it was quite hard at first, I remember I was the only guy at his birthday party who wasn't Malaysian or Singaporean. Quite a few of those guys are now working in London and are much at home as an expat can be. One of them has just poached a girl I was dating so clearly has no problems at all navigating British culture. ;-)

While NYCFC itself has been amazing to us New York Blues (truly—they've done a great job), their fans—the Third Rail, most especially—have been incredibly disrespectful to us, almost from day one.

Manchester City/CFG created a brand new team in New York City, have invested in the community with a future stadium and a youth academy—not to mention bringing in players like Villa, Lampard, and Pirlo. Nobody is forcing them to like Man City, but at the end of the day, they gave New York an MLS team. There wouldn't be an NYCFC without Manchester City, and yet, many of their fans can't comprehend that. Why? Because they want to ignore the connection to their parent club because it's inconvenient for some of them that it's Manchester City. (Except, of course, when it comes to spending money on players like David Villa, Frank Lampard, and Andrea Pirlo.) While I think they had the right to be angry about the whole Lampard fiasco, this attitude has been emanating before this—look at how pissy they got when their kits, which look similar to Man City's, were unveiled.

And since they can't take it out on Manchester City the organization, they take it out on us local New York Blues.

While we've been overwhelmingly supportive of the club, they've been nothing but nasty to us. Our members have been threatened online and in person, had rude comments made towards us and our community, and have been treated as if *we* were the ones responsible for all their issues with the team and organization.

So yeah. Love the club, hate the fans.

* First of all make it clear, and stick to, the application process. Make it clear at what stage fees are due and at what stages, and under what circumstances, they become non-refundable.
* Everyone likes cheap application fees.
* If you want to appeal to the higher end market, and are using a high application fee to separate the wheat from the chaff, offer a rebate for successful applications.
* Make the tenancy agreement as simple as possible. Not always easy with the desire to protect all parties but no-one wants to read a 21 page agreement when the majority of the time it can be done in half that. Have a system whereby non-applicable terms can be removed entirely (might cost more upfront in advice from solicitors).
* Avoid [Unfair Terms in Tenancy Agreements](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284440/oft356.pdf) if your lawyers want to put them in (and some will, dump them if so) - it makes both of you look shitty. In particular I'm looking at 3.78, 3.85 (e.g. let us see the tenancy agreement for putting in an application) .
* Don't automatically try and renew tenancies just to charge a fee when they would move on to rolling contracts anyway (there *are* however some situations where a further fixed term might be useful).


Horror stories: 

* Lettings agencies verbally describing a different application process (mostly the order) to what is  written on the pre-tenancy agreement and saying 'it doesn't matter'. 9/10 it probably doesn't but if something goes wrong everyone is damn well sure they're using the document that was signed and not the verbal one.
* Allowing the application to progress without people actually signing the pre-application form and the agency dismissing the importance of the document. Potentially great from the tenants point of view but what does it say about the firm?
* Having an agent describe the pre-tenancy agreement as not legally binding so one shouldn't worry about signing it. WTF, definitely one for /r/shittylegaladvice.

Housing Benefits (rent to private landlords)

    The figures from the Department of Work and Pensions show that the cost rose to £24.6-billion in 2013-2014, up from £22.99-billion when they took power in 2010

Controversial but here is what happens at present:

Person gets property, rents out to someone, person claims Housing Benefit, money goes from Govt to tenant, then Landlord - used at this point to pay off Mortgage, so indirectly the money benefits no-one, it is not 'spent' as such.

Cost is to Govt, benefit is to Bank (or landlord if he owns house outright) limited benefit to the 'Economy'

Instead, lets play devils advocate, lets take out a £50 Billion loan to invest in a MASSIVE housebuilding project.

£50 billion puts up house, places people into work, drives business and economy.

Once built, these house are handed to 'Council Control' on the Caveat they cannot be sold, or handed off to 'Private Equity Firms'.

Now lets see what happens instead.

Housing Benefit is no longer needed for Tenant in council property, it is classed as 'Non Revenue Generating' and instead simply incurs 'Maintenance Costs' (new build should be good for long period of time surely?)

Now flip it to someone working and NOT claiming Benefit, but living in rental.

Earn wage, rent paid to Landlord, paid to Bank again does not stimulate the Economy.

Post building boom, Rent paid to Council, property is 'Revenue Generating' and builds and income for Council, money then put into pot to pay off £50 Billion investment, once Pot paid off, income can be split 50/50 (after expenditures and running cost of housing stock) between council and Govt, Govt uses to reduce deficit, council uses to build more homes, invest locally, thus driving local economy

What makes you say that? the interview with Moffat indicates that the notion of using Eccleston was dumped pretty early on in the story writing process:

&gt; Yes, but do you know, I was always nervous of that one, because it doesn't fit with ""Rose"" at all. He is a brand new Doctor in ""Rose"", he's absolutely, definitely new. It couldn't have been is [sic] who pushed the button in the Time War, cos that's a new man, very explicitly, in that episode. I also had trouble, I have to be honest, imagining it being Paul McGann's Doctor

I haven't yet used Uber in London, but I've used it a lot in Leeds and in Manchester. There, Uber is just like any other minicab firm. It's regulated in the same way, the cars are pretty much the same and it costs roughly the same (sometimes a bit cheaper). Most private hire cab firms around here offer mobile app booking, and a handful offer card payment. 

As for the 'knowledge', I recently asked one minicab driver in Leeds to take me to the airport - he didn't know where it was. Clearly, whatever knowledge test private hire drivers do around here isn't particularly taxing.

Now, making jokes about abducted young girls is unquestionably in poor taste, and not something I personally want to look at, but on the other hand, when posting it on your own personal page (where someone has to either be friends with you or go looking for it), I think any offence caused is largely self-inflicted. I certainly don't think that 12 weeks jail time (not to mention a criminal record) represents Justice (as there are people making jokes in poor taste everyday) or is representative of the emotional harm that those people received from being offended by the joke.

A complain is that you want something fixed/corrected yes, but it doesn't mean that complaining about something should make it a criminal offence.

As for a witch hunt, I'll retreat to the definition here: 'witch-hunt' has acquired usage referring to the act of seeking and persecuting any perceived enemy, particularly when the search is conducted using extreme measures and with little regard to actual guilt or innocence.^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt#Figurative_usage)

In TalkTalk's case the costs to them are lowered because they aren't paying BT for PSTN access, they do it all on their own equipment and are simply paying BT to rent the copper line (and FTTC port for fibre)

&gt; In UFO in York, Openreach are no longer involved, so bascially they no longer have to pay them, so rather than gouge the customer for that, TalkTalk have removed it, instead you simply pay for the package you use.

I am aware, but I am talking about Openreach. 
 
https://ultrafibreoptic.talktalk.co.uk/already-with-talktalk - there's no cost saving for the customer for Openreach (ADSL) vs York here - just more speed?

&gt; this is a Joint venture between 3 companies, the Fibre is already in the ground, the only cost is to connect it to the users, this is a Test Bed for the tech, if it works, and can be done effectively, then Openreach is pretty much boned

The fibre wasn't put into the ground for free. Someone did it, someone wants a return on investment, TalkTalk will either be investing themselves or paying fees to whoever did (I don't know the background).

I don't think Openreach will be too fussed.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Rondon is about to come into the prime of his career, has a decent fitness record from what I've read and seems to be that all-round striker we've all wanted. He's got pace, power and he's got a tremendous goal-scoring tally. Before people say that he can't get goals in more competitive leagues, it's worth pointing out he reached double figures in his only two seasons whilst playing for Malaga in La Liga. If Rondon continues to improve, he'd be a fantastic option to have, however there are question marks about whether he'll be good enough for the premiership. It's worth noting that his goals are varied, he's not just an areal presence, he's very good at finishing and keeps his composure really well.

Bacca, it could be argued, is kind of coming towards the end of his prime, but throughout his career other than his 2009/2010 season at Brugge (10 apperances, 3 goals) he's never scored any less than 12 in a campaign. So as obvious of a trait as this sounds, Bacca is very good at getting the ball over the line. If you watch his goals this season at Sevilla, he feeds on scraps. Imagine watching Garcia's ghost goal 20 times and that's pretty much Bacca's season summed up. He's scrappy and gets his hands dirty in the box, to pick up that many goals your positioning has to be incredible, he does seem like a player who just finds a way to score if you can get it to him in the box. His goals do come across as quite lucky. Unlike Rondon, Bacca drops very deep and links up well with the midfield.

Anyway, my opinion; I think either would be excellent and absolutely a cheaper, more suited option than Benteke. I don't think Bacca would have any issues adapting to the league, whereas Rondon worries me a little bit. Bacca wouldn't have as many defensive errors to pounce on the premier league but I think his ability to link up with the midfielders would be invaluable. Rondon, if he hit the ground running, could be unstoppable. He's not at all clumsy with the ball at his feet, his positioning is excellent, but defenders will kick lumps out of him to stop him being a threat and he might lose confidence very quickly if he doesn't get a good start. If I had to pick one, I'd probably go with Rondon, simply because we'll be paying a similar price for either and Rondon will be in his prime for longer than Bacca, arguably we'll have to ship off Bacca in a couple of seasons.

TL:DR; Rondon simply because he's younger and our money could go further. ",null,0,null,1435163140,null,0,false,0,csh6xt3,null,t3_3aye8r,null,t1_csh6xt3,null,t3_3aye8r,null,null,null,1437314850,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

I hope, for us, for the team, and for him, that once he's recovered he can stay fit for a few seasons.

  This video made me realise a few things. Firstly, Coutinho missed him last season. Cou was probably our best player overall, but not having Sturridge to play those micron perfect through balls towards really cost us. Secondly, if Sturridge had been fit, I don't think Sterling would have decided to move on, not only because we would have been more competitive, but because they had a very good on- field (and off-field, social media suggests) relationship. Finally, it reminded me of exactly how fucking amazing Suarez is. How many of those goals were Suarez assists? I didn't count, but it has to be close to half. We won't see another player like him. 

  Studge should be fully fit with a couple of games under his belt by November. Him, Firmino and Coutinho playing together is mouthwatering, and we also have Can as a new weapon with his ridiculous forty yard, driven through-passes.

So, I didn't really leave because of any political unrest or frustration at the social attitudes of a vocal minority (though they still bother me to this day), more to live with my dad cos living in a council estate in Bangor was fucking shite.

Per KW - 16.08 


MPF Rental - the copper line

Per year per line - 87.48 

Initial connection (migration) - 30.76 

or

Initial connection (new line) 45.74 

Faults -
Testing lines on BT kit when faulty - 4.14 

SFI engineer investigation (this breaks down Per Module)

External Line - 58.30

This is what the 'Line Rental' is being used to pay for, but excluding the Fault costs, simply for installing a line and renting it is -

87.48 + 30.76 = 118.24

The issue has been discussed on numerous occasions in the House of Commons and the legal position is very clear. **[Here is one such clip](https://youtu.be/anb7BKIujtI?t=4m38s)** in which Jacob Rees-Mogg points it out;

*""I think it is immeasurably confusing when you start trying to divide the Queen up in this way. Her Majesty is our sovereign, full stop. That she is one person indivisible... she's not the Trinity, you know; Her Majesty the Queen, Her Majesty Mrs Windsor and Her Majesty the third party of the trinity. It doesn't work like that. She is one sovereign individual.""*

Essentially, he is (far more eloquently than I) pointing out that what in effect you are trying to do is apply 21st century property and business laws retrospectively to the Crown simply because it makes sense to you. To quote Rees-Mogg **""It doesn't work like that""**. The Crown as a corporation-sole is not a Ltd. Company. Although it might be tempting to think of it as a one-man company occupied by the Queen, it isn't that straightforward... because unlike a company it can ONLY be occupied by the Queen. In a sense the monarch is the Crown and the Crown is the monarch.

This reality is reflected in the legal position as well... and that position is (as I explained previously) that the sovereign in effect has possession of the Crown estates at the start of each new reign, and those have been seceded to parliament since the reign of George III in perpetuity (i.e. for the life of that monarch), until the start of the next reign when it all happens again. In essence it is an agreement. If parliament did not fulfill it's portion of the agreement, there would be a strong legal position to take recourse against parliament - and given that the judiciary are typically sympathetic to the legal position of the monarch (since they are driven by the legal facts rather than the reddit fiction) they would have a good chance of reversing any such decision.",null,0,null,1435165324,null,0,false,0,csh8ewr,null,t3_3axcvq,null,t1_csh8ewr,null,t1_csgwv0o,null,null,null,1437539897,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

&gt; Installing own 'secure location' - Bespoke

Spread across thousands of customers (since TalkTalk doesn't go into exchanges with little demand) over a long term, like several years, this is not a lot

&gt; MPF Rental - the copper line

&gt; Per year per line - 87.48

&gt; Initial connection (migration) - 30.76

&gt; or

&gt; Initial connection (new line) 45.74 

vs. £200 per year (£16.70*12) collected in line rental, let alone what is additionally charged for the broadband, and higher fees charged to those with bespoke connections and business services - and whatever income they get from wholesale rental to other ISPs

&gt; Faults 

Not relevant unless a fault occurs

&gt; As I stated, York is a testbed, the council and businesses are invested in making this work, and when it does you can bet some of the other cities will clamour for it, then once the tech is proven, think how easy (and quick) it will be to Microtrench a line to Rural areas and give them this?

I know it's a testbed, but my point is that it has to make money and it has to be good. I am not convinced that roughly £20 a month is going to achieve both. Especially from an ISP like TalkTalk, which doesn't have a stellar record on quality of service and routinely ranks fairly low in customer satisfaction surveys

As for the possibility of a rural rollout, I'll believe it when they actually start doing it. BT can barely be bothered with FTTP and they have the advantage of owning ducts and poles.

I'm guessing you work for TalkTalk or Sky and are valiantly trying to defend everything that they do, but let's get real. It's a very big ask and it's not likely to topple the great Openreach monopoly

&gt; Bear in mind they offer both LLU and IPstream at same cost, so LLU are subsiding that cost, also it is not possible to get costings on 'Backhaul' rental (exchange to ISP POP) which is also paid for by the Line Rental

Most TalkTalk customers are on LLU or FTTC though. Your last bit reaffirms my point - that TalkTalk choose to push most of their costs into the line rental price to make the broadband cheaper. My ISP, with its small-ish LLU network, chooses to reflect the costs of providing a broadband service into the broadband price. They also choose to let you go with someone else with the phone line if you like (and charge something like £3 or 4 extra per month if you do)",null,0,null,1435165411,null,0,1435165831,0,csh8gy8,null,t3_3axd4u,null,t1_csh8gy8,null,t1_csh80cy,null,null,null,1437539781,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;When did I say you did. The point is you made assumptions of how I was dealing with my emotions and saying how it was in an immature way.

I was specifically talking about ""anyone"" that deals with emotions about this subject with complaining and bitching and sulking on an internet forum. 

So I used that as an example on how it really isn't effecting me that bad. I used it as an example to show you that someone can be upset over a club legend leaving for a club rival with being ""mentally unstable"" as you put it.

Never said being upset makes you mentally unstable. I said crying about it and not getting over it makes you mentally unstable. 

&gt;No, you have made assumptions. For a start you said I was sulking, which I haven't done. If you think putting an opinion across on a forum is sulking then I think a forum isn't the right place for you. 

Did I ever specifically say I was talking about you? You made the assumption I was.

&gt;&gt;Who ever said I wasn't sad to see him leave? And what are these assumptions I've made?

&gt;I never said you wasn't(weren't) sad to see him leave. Maybe you should read the conversation you got involved in? 

Weren't* and I'm aware of the conversation. You have taken what I said and some how made it all about you.

He seems to want box-to-box central midfielders, and now has 3 good ones (Milner, Hendo, Can) plus backups in Lucas and Allen. Lallana, Markovic, and Sterling/Cheryshev will likely play as wingers. Coutinho and Firmino will operate as #10 or tandem attacking midfielders (also takes the pressure off of Coutinho there in the hole), depending on if we go one up front or two up front, considering we have Ings, Sturridge (if fit), Origi, and potentially one more up top and we want to keep everyone happy, not to mention having another heavy load of games this year.

This seems like more what BR might have in mind going forward - this group can play 4-3-3, a diamond in midfield, 4-2-1-3, 4-1-2-3, 3-4-1-2, and on and on without really playing anyone 'out of position', so to speak. Want more defense? Can and Milner, 4-2-3-1. Need more energy? Go with Hendo, Milner, and Firmino, 4-3-3.

as the Fibre City network already exists, there is no cost needed to install that network, they are also not paying for Cabinets (street furniture) to be installed and maintained, they are not running massive exchanges with racks of equipment, instead the Fibre equipment is pretty low key, meaning they can run 'data centres' at the POP and run those into the existing networks, infact, I think they will end up lighting a lot of Dark Fibre on the networks,

But again, you're making the assumption that because someone is voicing their opinion that it means they are sulking, and bitching? I mean, in a thread about Cech joining Arsenal people are obviously going to voice their concerns. That's not bitching or sulking. 

&gt;Did I ever specifically say I was talking about you? You made the assumption I was.

&gt;Weren't* and I'm aware of the conversation. You have taken what I said and some how made it all about you.

You replied directly to me and addressed something I had said... That's not an assumption, that's called understanding the conversation. If I say someone lacks passion and you click reply on my comment and make a comment back saying you think it's just called being an adult with your passion, that's quite clearly you talking to/about me. It's not an assumption, it's being able to understand a conversion and the context of the conversation.

At the end of the day I made a statement about people not being scared of Arsenal if they got Cech, they just don't want to see a club hero play for a club rival and that it would be upsetting. Is that false? 

He replied saying it wouldn't be upsetting which is why I questioned his passion, again, is that wrong? How can someone who is passionate about a club not be upset over that?

Which is when you got involved with the whole ""he's just dealing with it like an adult"" rubbish. Adult's still get upset you know? Dealing with it in an adult way is like when Lampard played against us. Every Chelsea fan would have been upset about him playing against us but we still cheered him and applauded him, even after he scored. That's the adult way to deal with it.

What about suicides stemming from nothing to do with finances, e.g. loneliness, or routine calls for euthanasia to be legalised making them feel like life is only worth living if you're young and beautiful which they aren't any more, or angry declarations that there too many people here for hardworking people to get a house, or ageing populations placing a strain on health services?

Do you know how much of that is captured in austere statistical number spinning? Approximately zilch.

Welfare

*Pensions, Healthcare and Education* from 1998 to 2015 have each tripled from approx £50 Billion to just under £150 Billion (so thats £450 Billion between those three)

*Welfare* has grown from £50 to £100 Billion in the same timescales


so for 2015/16 the expenditure is (in Billions)

Pensions - 154.7

Healthcare - 135.1

Education - 92

Defense - 43.2

Welfare 111.7 with a 'mere' 2.7 spent on 'Housing'

null,false,listyraesder,null,null,null,"Irish Citizens residing in Britain are legally considered to be British Citizens in all but name for a wide variety of historical and political reasons. When this came into being in the 1930s, Britain was reliant on Irish labour for construction, heavy industry and civil engineering. The Free State, while not exactly on great terms with the old repressor, likewise relied on Britain to employ vast numbers of citizens in its young economy.

Every Irish Citizen born before 1948 is also a British Subject because the King was the head of state of the Irish Free State and it was in a state of quasi-independence, so they could also have British passports without being Irish Citizens.

And of course there's the Northern Ireland thing. The Republic contended that anyone born on the Island of Ireland was automatically an Irish Citizen regardless of their nationality. There were plenty in the North who took Irish Citizenship but didn't take British citizenship due to a hole in the cobbled-together laws. This left people in Northern Ireland who were denied the vote. The simplest solution was to just give the Irish the vote.

Because of the rush-job Westminster did when the Republic was declared, things were a little frayed around the edges. *In theory*, Irish Citizens could be deported from the UK but British Citizens couldn't be deported from Eire because Ireland didn't make the same errors.

In 2007, the British Government fixed a few of the unintended contradictions in the law. Now, Irish Citizens are exempt from statutory deportation at the end of their British prison sentence, except for a narrow list of very serious offences.

Under UK law, the Republic of Ireland is not a *foreign* country, and thus Irish Citizens aren't foreigners. If the Home Office decided to attempt to extradite an Irish citizen who hasn't committed one of those serious offences, then there would be a large body of precedent and law that would say they can't be extradited because they aren't foreign etc. The Government would eventually win, but it really isn't worth their time and the press they'll get.",null,0,null,1435167208,null,0,false,0,csh9per,null,t3_3ayjvp,null,t1_csh9per,null,t1_csh4hm4,null,null,null,1437316292,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I love the concept of punishing disabled people by turning their TV's of in the day time. You obviously have not watched much day time TV, as that is punishment enough.

Seriously, you obviously aren't disabled because try to put yourself in the shoes off someone who is. Someone who gets looked at by adults and children alike in the street, or someone who lives life in some sort of permanent pain or discomfort. Forget the Daily Mail idea of people suddenly doing gymnastics or football as soon as there front door is closed after they've struggled to the shops and back. You also have not lived in government provided accommodation on government provided income, these are not lottery winners playing Xbox one on giant HD TV's, waving their butler over to get more canapés and champagne.

Living on welfare is shit, it barely provides and it is tough to break out of this position without the kindness of others, so there is the challenge of sacrificing some independence along the way too.

Surely in a modern society we should be doing our best to help people have the best life possible, not punishing them for not being what we consider normal.

Most disabled people would give their right arm for the ability not to live on welfare but there is little choice.


Thanks for the question, and thanks for the chuckle, maybe we can put Stephen hawking or tanni grey Thompson on hamster wheels which help power the national grid!

&gt;After injuring his knee in training before the start of the season, King did not start his season until mid-September. Then after breaking his metatarsal again, he did not feature for Spurs from Boxing Day until the [UEFA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup) quarter-final clash with [Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC) in mid-April. Spurs played 59 games in all competitions that season, but King featured in less than half of them. Tottenham only managed 3 clean sheets against top flight opposition without King in the side. In a [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) clash with reigning champions [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) at [White Hart Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Hart_Lane), Spurs went on to win the game 2–1, meaning King had captained Tottenham to their first league win over Chelsea since 1990, and the first at White Hart Lane since 1987.

null,false,InfiniteTypewriters,null,null,null,"It's a very difficult issue. I've worked as a benefits adviser for several years, visiting people in their homes and helping them with their benefit claims. A lot of sick people are being unfairly treated these days and being told they are fit to go and find work when they clearly aren't. Undoubtedly as a result of the government setting targets to get so many people off sickness benefits. These people are often ill equipped to fight for their rights and many end up without money for months on end.

On the flipside, I also see a lot of people who are just lazy plain and simple. They spend all day at home but their houses are filthy and they can't even maintain their own personal hygiene. They invariably ""suffer"" from depression or anxiety or some other easily faked condition (I'm not suggesting that everyone with these horrible illnesses is faking of course). I also see many who consistantly dont meet their job seeking requirements because even spending a few hours each day looking for work is too much effort. These people are also sadly the ones who end up having the most children, who are practically dragged up through life and end up growing up to emulate their shitty parents. Then the cycle continues.

Many probably grew up with parents who did the same and they live around other people who also have this attitude. I'll often visit someone on a council estate and most of the houses have all the occupants sat outside smoking and generally not doing very much. It sounds like I'm stereotyping here but I honestly see this kind of thing day in and day out. Many have drug or alcohol issues because they have nothing else fulfilling in their lives. Then they end up with real mental and physical health issues later in life as a result. It's a very depressing sight to see people with literally no direction or aspirations. On most morning visit that I attend, Jeremy Kyle is on the TV when I walk in. No doubt so popular because it's makes people's lives seem a little less awful by comparison.

There is definitely a culture of dependancy on benefits that has gotten out of control in the UK, but that said there should be a better system to weed out the work shy and more support for those with genuine health issues. The current system is far from working and many Jobcentre staff seem to be jaded cynics, who tar all the unemployed with the ""lazy"" brush.

The UK is more preferable to other European countries for asylum seekers because it is more tolerant and has a greater cultural reach. These are both positive things which aren't worth compromising for the sake of xenophobia.

There's a rule called the Dublin convention or something which means that any migrant documented in an EU country must seek asylum in that country as it is their point of entry into Europe. The reason the French are letting these migrants sit in Calais is because the UK isn't cooperating with the rest of the EU and thus they're not documenting them and ushering them north. Our asylum process is already very stringent so claims that migrants are posing as asylum seekers simply aren't true, you need to have extensive scarring from torture etc for your claim to be accepted.

If they're using the ECHR here, they might lose:


Article 12 of the ECHR:
&gt;“Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.”

[Schalk and Kopf vs. Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schalk_and_Kopf_v_Austria#Judgment):
&gt;""The Court notes that Article 12 grants the right to marry to “men and women”. [..] Furthermore, Article 12 grants the right to found a family. The applicants argued that the wording did not necessarily imply that a man could only marry a woman and vice versa. **The Court observes that, looked at in isolation, the wording of Article 12 might be interpreted so as not to exclude the marriage between two men or two women. However, in contrast, all other substantive Articles of the Convention grant rights and freedoms to “everyone” or state that “no one” is to be subjected to certain types of prohibited treatment. The choice of wording in Article 12 must thus be regarded as deliberate.** Moreover, regard must be had to the historical context in which the Convention was adopted. In the 1950s marriage was clearly understood in the traditional sense of being a union between partners of different sex.""
&gt; [...] the Convention is to be read as a whole and its Articles should therefore be construed in harmony with one another.


It's unfortunate, but the Court is probably in the right here. Funny, if it didn't talk about marriage at all, we might have had same-sex marriage 5 years ago.


EDIT: The other reasoning they tried failed 4 to 3. In the dissent:
&gt; Having identified a “relevantly similar situation” (paragraph 99), and emphasised that “differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons by way of justification” (paragraph 97), the Court should have found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention because the respondent Government did not advance any argument to justify the difference of treatment**, relying in this connection mainly on their margin of appreciation.
&gt; [...] Today it is widely recognised and also accepted by society that same- sex couples enter into stable relationships. Any absence of a legal framework offering them, at least to a certain extent, the same rights or benefits attached to marriage (see paragraph 4 of this dissent) would need robust justification, especially taking into account the growing trend in Europe to offer some means of qualifying for such rights or benefits.


With 3 of the 7 in the small panel disagreeing 5 years ago, they might have a chance after all if they focus on the discrimination having no serious reasons to justify it.",null,0,null,1435170635,null,0,1435186505,0,cshc270,null,t3_3aycne,null,t1_cshc270,null,t3_3aycne,null,null,null,1437317903,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

Personally, I'd sell the players mentioned previously besides Allen if it meant securing William Carvalho.

We know that Manquillo is as good as gone and Ilori will most likely me loaned out again. We should also trim the younger fat and move players like Yesil.

Clyne needs to be completed immediately, and we have little to no depth at FB. I assume Flanno and Strurridge are always out leaving Wisdom our only realistic option. If our first choice FBs aren't fit, I think we're forced into playing a back-3. We could do well bringing in a new LB, but after spending so much already I doubt we'll drop another 15 to buy a new one. Most likely I think is we'd pick someone up on loan for the season and hope Moreno continues to improve. 

Buying Bacca for 21 is a no-brainer. The only problem would be convincing him to come. Liverpool absolutely need a new starting number 9 next season. We will not be successful next season with without one.

If I were running as Labour leader in 2020 Id be working on a broad church strategy. It would be 70% pro-business blairite centre, to win back the middle from the Tories (aim for 30 seats stolen, thus +30 us -30 them = 60 seats closer) but also throw in three very left policies to secure the base and win back 30 SNP seats and a half million votes from the Greens (probably huge nuclear power &amp; renewable commitment with a target of fossil fuel free by 2050/60; renationalisation of the rails; referendum on marijuana). Finally, Id focus on jobs jobs jobs, both to win the Tory-lite centrists, but also the blue collar millions who voted UKIP, especially targeting the north of England, and come up with a town-redevelopment scheme for the hundreds of abandoned and dying costal towns. 

The marijuana one might initially come across as too extreme, however, I believe that it will be the next gay marriage for progressive countries. Beyond that it is the promise of a referendum, not a straight legalisation - no one can argue against giving the people a say, and if we can get the Daily Mail in favour of it from a ""stop the nanny state"" angle, it's sure to pass (we already have the greens, lib dems and ukip all kind-of favouring it). Finally, it is important because labour only got 9m votes, compared to 10m non-voters; if we truly promise something exciting and radical, we might get up to a million non-voters on  our side.

null,false,bockers7,lfc99,,null,"It depends how BR wants to set up the team. IF he wants to play like we did last year with two wide players and 1 striker, which failed miserably, then yes we need a striker. BUT if we play with two strikers, then no we do not. Hear me out before you flip your lid and tell me I'm wrong. Also would like to add, the only thing I thinkg we really really need is a RB and CDM. Going against the grain here but hear me out..

With the addition of yet another AM who may just be moved on the endline bc BR won't be able fit Lallana, Coutinho, and Firmino in together unless someone is awfully out of place. They will have to rotate, which is 100% ok with me, but in my opinion I still believe we *have* to play with two strikers. We were not any threat going forward with one, especially since our main/proven striker is injured. It doesn't matter how many creative midfielders we have if our system doesnt provide them targets. 

Now, last season as a single striker Mario was not effective. But he's never been a CF who runs in behind. Our only real target was Sterling, although he did okay, is not a striker and/or understands how or when to make those runs. To me Mario is not a bad player and I'm tired of seeing this r/lfc give up on him. I would rather not buy a striker and keep Mario as long as we play with 2 strikers. That will go against 99% of the opinion here, but I dont think we need a striker if we can build the team properly. Also, there isn't a single world class striker available other than potentially Higuain and maybe Benzema, which I highly doubt. If for whatever reason we can get either of those two, then I'm all for shipping our Mario and investing in a striker. But every one we have looked at are unproven young talent. We already have two of those on our roster. Bacca isn't young and did well at Seville, but he's not a world class striker. Telling me he scored so and so goals in Spain is irrelavent bc Spain isn't England and the game is completely different here where south americans are famous for not being able to adapt. IF we don't get either of those two which I doubt we will, I say we keep Mario and give it a good go with the strikers we have. If you partner him up with someone he can be a great asset. He's good in the air and good at holding up the ball, something we'll need if we're not just going to play on counters. Studge is hurt, so that leaves Ings/Orgi for him to partner up with at the start. Ings is more mobile, proven in the prem, so I think we should go that route. Adding another striker who isn't world class to our squad isn't going to help the situation. But I'm in the minority on this one. LFC fans get way too hyped up on our transfer targets then get all pissed when they don't come good within the first 6 months. Lovren, Markovic, Moreno, Lallana all still have plenty of time to really make an impact. I have faith in our bench and our players, I just dont have as much faith in BR as I once did. I also don't think he will actually play two strikers, so maybe me making an argument for it is a waste a time. I just feel it's the best way forward. 

To me this should be our lineup - in a perfect world if everyone is healthy (looking at you Lucas)


----------Skrtl----Sakho------------

Clyne-------------------------Moreno

------------------Lucas--------------

--------Milner/Hendo-----------------

------Firmino----------Coutinho-----

---------Mario------------------------

------------------Studge--------------

Playing with attacking fullbacks which we already try to do, but more emphasis on them getting balls across, similar to how Cafu/RCarlos use to play for Brazil. Lucas holds tight at all time covering his CB's with Milner/Hendo, who ever is in, providing cover.. I put in Milner simply bc I don't see him not starting after paying him what we did. Hendo has the legs to do it and will probably be the one to do it. I dont see Milner/Hendo/Can all starting unless Can is placed elswhere, especially with Coutinho/Firmino/Lallana as our AM. I think Joe Allen has been good in some games but he will be used sparingly this upcoming season if health is not an issue to other players. Coutinho and Firmino both have a habit of going out wide, but we will need them to concentrate on remaining closer to the middle. Hendo/Milner both have the ability to take the ball down the middle if asked to, so spacing should not be an issue with those 3. Lallana, Joe Allen, Can, Markovic, Ibe will all get plenty of playing time, but Markovic/Ibe would get a lot more if we play like we did this year, with 2 sets of wide players and a single striker. I know BR will favor this approach, but I have been against and will continue to argue that we need to strikers. 

What I think BR wants to do is use Firmino as a false 9 type player instead of Balotelli bc Balo doesn't track.

But what I think BR is gonna do is this: 

Use Firmno in that role while having Hendo and Milner covering up Lucas and being the engine in the middle. It's the most likely scenario bc I dont' see Milner or Hendo on the bench. Can may start at CDM but I just dont htink he has the mental sharpeness yet to be asked to do that. Still hoping we strengthen here. 
BR's most likely 11-

Because of that I think BR and most managers would try to use him on the defensive end of things, try and shape him to be a CDM. But he has a habit and loves taking the ball forward. He doesn't have that vision to make the killer pass, but he has the work ethic on the pitch to make his runs mean something. He's a presence and I think he has everything to be a great player, I'm just not sure how he will be developed. There are tons of players who come to the EPL expected to be something but end up being something completely different. Lucas Leiva and Anderson from United are two great examples. Lucas Leiva was much more of a traditional CM than anything else. He both attacked and defended, but had quite a few assists in his day. When he came to Liverpool we changed his game completely. Anderson went to United as one of the world best traditional CM's as well. But was converted to a CDM. So I think Can may fall into this. He has everything to be that engine in the middle, both defend and attack, but bc of his physical presence, coaches are going to try to turn him into a CDM. Especially bc he's going up against Milner who's getting paid a butt load and Hendo our vice captain.

I will always favour other forms of renewable energy over nuclear power, and I do understand the environmental concerns with nuclear power, but I don't think those concerns are as serious as the threat of further greenhouse gas emissions.

I mostly agree with that plan. I'm just curious as to what your centre policies might be. I'm in favour of lowering corporation tax for small businesses and lowering VAT. These may even help to encourage more small businesses to pay the living wage. 

I would, however, want to increase corporation tax for larger businesses to around 21% (it's 20% for all right now, I think). I would also drop the special rate for 'ring fence' companies, which for some reason lowers corporation tax for companies which profit from ""oil extraction or oil rights."" Instead, I'd give that status to companies in the renewable energy sector (or perhaps an other area too). 

I like the idea for a referendum on marijuana, though I think the next government should legislate to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of drugs regardless of whether marijuana is legalised for sale. That's the system that Amsterdam has and it seems fairly effective. I've only heard good things so far from Colorado and Washington, too. 

I certainly agree with the town regeneration scheme. I think the renewable/green sector could be hugely beneficial for coastal towns, with both the prospect of off-shore wind farms and tidal power.

As for my other ideas, I really want to see devolution for the English regions. I don't mean what this government is promising with its fairly meagre plans of Mancunian devolution, rather I want to see assemblies or parliaments for the north, midlands, and south of England (at least). (London already has its own assembly so they wouldn't be part of the southern parliament, but could have some more powers devolved to them potentially). Maybe it sounds excessive, but it's only the same as what Germany has. Finally, I'd like to see us drop first-past-the-post and reform the House of Lords, but I wouldn't really campaign on the latter as most people don't seem to be too worried about that.",null,0,null,1435173553,null,0,false,0,cshe1s4,null,t3_3ay5ms,null,t1_cshe1s4,null,t1_cshclg4,null,null,null,1437319374,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null
