Not the cheapest around at Â£140, but it included lunch, tea\coffee and all hire.                

  
Started at 10am classroom and off-road practises until around 12:30 lunch break til around 1 recap then on the road training until 4pm.          
Never ridden a geared bike (rev and go moped about 10 years ago) and the instructors were brilliant. The group was 6 (2 automatic, 4 geared) and 2 instructors were there for all the off-training and for on the road training there were 3 instructors in groups of 2.        
When ever anyone was struggling ( I'll admit it was me to start,  gearing and clutch control took a while) they got help straight away.              
They even gave you a goodie bag at the end with a copy of the highway code, discounted further training (CBT plus for Â£15) and other bits and pieces.

So much nonsense Cameron tried to address it by putting lock-safes in place so it couldn't be overturned - and that's what he argued on? That the oversight panels and the civil service wrote law on it?

It was put into the bill!  

So how much nonsense could it have been?

The counter argument being that the locksafes themselves could be overturned leaving it open.

And then somebody did actually try.

And all they said was rewrite the bill to take government and religion out of marriage, and then it would diffuse the situation and concern.

&gt;As for ""gay therapy"" stuff, the reason it is the state's place to judge is because we're talking about it being on the NHS, and the state (indirectly) decides what treatments the NHS provides.

Massively wrong.  It's devolved to NGOs and NHS bodies outside government control.

You're talking like the government is synonymous with state, and the state is synonymous with bodies like NICE.  

It doesn't work like that.  It's the whole reason why people want to break up QUANGOs and bodies like MONITOR.

4,500. If they could import sugarcane without EU tariffs they would be able to competitively refine significantly more and employ more people in the process.

&gt;And on the other hand, how many people are employed by the vast number of companies who are only based in the UK because it's part of the EU and it's English speaking, and that would be ready to move elsewhere in the EU in case of a Brexit? e.g. Nissan

That number is as incalculable as the number of jobs the UK has failed to develop as a direct result of EU trade walls. For what it's worth, Nissan has its European headquarters in Switzerland (outside the EU) and has manufacturing as-well as R&amp;D plants located across the world - the majority of which are outside the EU. The UK happens to be very good at R&amp;D and manufacturing, which is why so many car manufacturers chose to place their assembly plants in the UK before dispatching for *worldwide* exports. If anything, being outside the EU would cut the UK's losses with having an economically inert trade partner in Europe in favor of booming Eastern economies.

&gt;On top of that you would have the cost of lost immigration, which as everyone with a shred of knowledge is aware of, is a net contribution to the country's economy.

The vast majority of EU&gt;UK migration is low skilled workers, which is lunacy in a time of elevated low-skilled unemployment. The majority of highly skilled migrants come from outside the EU. For example, the single largest countries of origin for NHS migrants (doctors, nurses; band 5+) are Nigeria, India and the Philippines.

Yet UKIP constantly insists that gay people will be banging down church doors demanding to get married, when the likelyhood of that happening is incredibly small.

It seems biased towards attackers that way of rating. I assume defenders get more points for a clean sheet too? Which leaves midfielders with quite a big disadvantage to score well.

There's also /r/ukmod

&gt;The moderators of various UK-Centric subreddits have been carrying out questionable bans and removal of content based on the ideology of the content (as opposed to breaking any rules).

&gt;Although the typical defence of this attitude is that people were banned due to being massively racist or brigading (which would be justified), in reality many cases of users being banned has been because they supported viewpoints to the right of center (or even, in some cases, centrist) that a moderator disagreed with. Additionally, criticism of the left is often subject to deletion.

&gt;Typical signs of censorship by /r/unitedkingdom involve your account being banned and, upon requesting information about why you were banned, being met with complete silence. We suggest that any instances in which you think you were censored as opposed to breaking any rules to first message the moderation and then, if you receive silence in response, post here.

&gt;We are here to document this phenomenon, and to provide a space where you can criticize moderation safely without being banned or silenced.

&gt;&gt;Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III.[23] Spain's Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp.[24] Amid the British invasions of the RÃ­o de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily.

So in fact it seems Spain and Britain (Spain, really) were the last countries to settle the Falklands before the Argentine Confederation claimed them.

Then Britain ""reasserted it's claim"" and took the *whole* archipielago.

He's not going to get in the lineup ahead of Ramsey, Wilshere, Ozil, Carzola, they've even extended Rosicky's contract. Those are just their central attacking midfielders, the position Milner says he wants to play in.

The problem is that how much do we actually know about the conflict, what if the loosing side started the conflict.

He's about the closest player to Drogba around at the moment, powerful and aerially dominant Jose knows how to work that in a system. I think he wins about 54% of his aerial duels, in this league that's an incredible stat. For reference Costa wins about 20% iirc.   
  
1 great season, 2 good ones with a few injury problems, no doubt caused because he was rushed back into action. Wouldn't happen at Chelsea.

William spent quite some time trying to balance parliament, and the different factions in it, you have to remember the King (or queen) appointed the prime minister, as they still do (although its more a formality these days).

There was massive mistrust of Catholics before James ascended to the throne, having seen the actions of them abroad and at home. The question how do we stop them from doing that sort of thing here? Was answered by making them unable to do much of anything rather than addressing why they'd want to in the first place.

Of course when James came and promoted Catholics over protestants in the army, the mistrust was still there (*edit:* look at how big bonfire night still is) and when he disarmed protestants this only amplified the fear. After I nice handy regime change the same questions were asked and the same conclusions arrived at. 


Due to the nature of the two parliaments in England and Ireland political change happened at a very different rate, and those sort of conclusions fell out of favour, in Ireland where there was a far greater risk to the status quo with these changes they were more adamantly opposed.


I don't think it's fair to blame the order for the penal laws and that sort of thing because it was only formed in 1795, six years later the Act of Union was on the books and soon after that those laws were done away with. 


There are other points to the early order's keenness on William, and the Glorious Revolution, it secured liberty for many protestants, although mostly Anglicans by 1795 could only feel the effects. The victory at the Boyne had kept them safe and secure for generations. One particular clause of the Bill of Rights has to be acknowledged when looking at the formation of the order, and the battle of the Diamond, the right to keep arms suitable for their defence (quite frankly I think the yanks ballsed it up a bit by dropping the suitable for defence bit) and that right was used to its full extent.


So to summarise the principles of the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights are something that definitely should be celebrated, despite the fact that they were poorly implemented across the board, and to a certain extent we should celebrate it all the more because it was poorly implemented (hold fire yet let me finish) to remind people of the principles and to ensure they are implemented properly.",null,0,null,1433663407,null,0,1433664474,0,cry9l22,null,t3_38tbn3,null,t1_cry9l22,null,t1_crxssw3,null,null,null,1436790910,null,8,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,8,null

On religion and the ECHR, what Cameron did to change the bill doesn't necessarily reflect the the *legal* reality as much as the political reality. As far as the ECHR is concerned it doesn't matter what the law says; the Strasbourg Court rules on breaches of the ECHR itself, not on the national law, so changing the national law to add extra locks preventing the Church of England from officiating same-sex weddings won't affect their ruling much.

Plus the Court has already ruled on the issue of same-sex marriage (iirc), and basically said that they're keeping out of it until there is far greater consensus across the Council of Europe.

UKIP's suggestion of abolishing the legal concept of marriage is an interesting one (and with some support), but seems a bit of an extreme reaction to ""we want to make sure the Church of England can keep discriminating against gay people."" Which is what this whole story is about; UKIP supporting discrimination or not.

I've witnessed several ESA ""medicals"" and one DLA home visit. The home visit doctor was very pleasant and understanding, couldn't have had a nicer guy. ESA is hit and miss, been to about 6 or 7 of them and only once was the interviewer an actual medical professional, a nurse in that case, the rest where ""health care professionals"" or just DWP admin staff with very little compassion.

ESA medical is such a joke, they flip through your form trying to catch you out, ask about a typical day for you then have you do some basic movements, guess it has to be simple enough for any DWP office jockey to do.

&gt;Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Burnham were both furthest to the left when it came to defending the comprehensive system. Mary Creagh and Liz Kendall chose instead to focus on the effects of education â with Kendall describing it as the key to tackling inequality and Creagh quoting Einstein while attacking Michael Gove.

&gt;The related issue of tuition fees also divided the candidates, with Corbyn offering to abolish them and both Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper proposing to move to a system of a graduate tax. Liz Kendall said that she would not abolish fees, putting her spending emphasis instead on the early years.

On the Party's structure in Scotland:
&gt;Andy Burnham was challenged over the perception that he supported an independent Scottish Labour Party. He responded that he hadnât wanted to dismiss the idea â put to him by some Scottish Labour members â out of hand, but it instinctively didnât feel right to him.   
Yvette Cooper argued that we must not break up the Labour Party and must cherish the values of our solidarity. People struggling to achieve their dreams in Scotland have more in common with those doing the same in England than divides them.   
Liz Kendall also expressed opposition to the idea. She argued that Labour had campaigned in and won the Scottish referendum by arguing that we are stronger when we pool our resources and share our risks and that should be as true for the Labour Party as it is for the country.  
Mary Creagh â on the other hand â did not rule out supporting a independent Scottish Labour Party explicitly, but did say that we need to tell the story of how over movement works across the union to provide better for everyone.  
Jeremy Corbyn probably went the furthest in supporting the idea of a separate and independent Scottish labour Party arguing that devolution has meant we are moving towards a more federal Britain and that could well mean we need a federal Labour Party.

null,false,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,null,"&gt;when I looked at that question i had no idea where to start. 

When faced with something new, write out the information you have in smaller equations. First, the probability is 1/3rd of doing two different things. What's the equation for that?

P(first thing) x P(second thing) = 1/3

That's not enough but can we fill in either of those probabilities?

Well the first is easier, the chance of picking one of 6 things out of a bad containing n. 

Then what's the chance of picking another? Given we know there's one less in the bag, and one less thing we're looking for, that's pretty much the equation before but one less on the top and bottom.

Now replace the P(...) bits with what we've just done and you have

6/n x 5/(n-1) = 1/3

That'd get you some marks. Now you need to rearrange it into the form the give.

Multiplying two fractions is easy, you multiple both the tops together and both the bottoms together.

30 / (n x (n - 1)) = 1/3

Now let's simplify it a bit. We can get an easier looking thing getting rid of the 1/3 . multiplying it by 3 does that. We do this to both sides because they're equal. 

Then multiply by the bottom of the left side (again, they're equal, so do this to both sides).

Looks much nicer. Expand the brackets and you're almost there, looks very much like the answer we need 

90 = n^2 - n

Now take 90 from both sides.",null,0,null,1433666378,null,0,false,0,crya8xa,null,t3_38smck,null,t1_crya8xa,null,t1_crxtsau,null,null,null,1436791329,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Housing prices are a symptom of a far more insidious disease - the abolition of the middle class.

The constant push to cut prices on consumer goods has led to a situation where anything that costs money gets outsourced to the lowest bidder - and modern communications mean it's perfectly possible for the lowest bidder to be some dude in India who can live just fine on Â£10 a day. 

For those whose jobs haven't been outsourced.... well, ten years ago the best way to get a decent pay rise was to switch jobs. Today it's pretty much the only way to keep up with inflation. You take the job, go through several years of miniscule or no raises then move on to another job with a pay rise that is substantial on paper but if you sit down and work it out, puts you back precisely where you were.

Twenty years ago, if your parents both worked average middle class jobs and were able to make substantial sacrifices, they could send you to a private school - or if that wasn't an option, move house to a part of town where the schools were on the whole better. 

We went to university and we did not study art history.

Yeah, it's concerning - the supposed logic is that Rodgers didn't have anyone on his backroom staff to challenge his perspective and offer alternative views. It's a fair point - you want your backroom staff to both support what you're doing and buy into it, but also to offer thoughts and insights that didn't occur to you, otherwise they're just yes-men and glorified training cone dispensers. 

But sacking both Pascoe and Marsh seems too much - if they'd kept Pascoe and replaced Marsh with someone else, that'd make sense. Losing both runs the risk of seriously undermining Rodgers. 

Equally concerning is the broader trend of FSG heavily imprinting their idea of what the manager's job should be, especially when they haven't got football experience themselves, and the other system they've put in place to reduce the manager's role (the transfer committee) is imperfect at best.

Finally, in my anger and confusion I rev the engine hard and just let go of the clutch. The force pops the front wheel in the air into a wheelie and I proceed to ride the wheelie bricking my pants down the course and came to a stop right where I was supposed to at the other end of the pavement.

Regardless of the truth, that's what they are often being sold. If it's a known fact that you won't get anything in Britain the first year regardless of whether you're starving or not, and that no one gives illegal immigrants a job (another thing that needs to completely change first), maybe some of them will decide the main land (or their own country) isn't so bad after all. With that information they know for a fact they can either apply for a visa (and have a good reason to be here, because they were in danger or they saved up enough money to actually stay alive whilst job hunting. Or maybe they already found a job.) or starve in the streets of London. Changes need to be made, things need to be improved. Closing the borders will create so much more problems than it fixes. I honestly believe there is a solution that can be found without closing the borders or leaving the EU whilst still helping the hard-working immigrants and the ones that have a good reason to want to live here.

The Air Force, Navy and Army Air Corps providing assistance after the 2004 tsunami? The flood relief provided in England?

What about the mobile field hospital in Sierra Leaon built and run by the armed forces to help combat ebola?

What about teaching indigenous peoples how to protect themselves? Training the Kurdish Peshmerga fighting IS, or the African nations dealing with Boko Haram? What about taking part in the UN peacekeeping forces, which from Sarajevo to Somalia have saved countless lives through humanitarian assistance and sheer presence of force?

What about all the roles in the Army that are not simply combat infantry? Logistics and supply, medical staff, engineers, signals, transport, caterers, policing, intelligence, recruitment, research and development, chaplains - do these people exist solely to kill others?

There aren't many similarities except from geography. The UK has more with Commonwealth than the Union.

The astounding numbers you'll find on costs for the UK to stay a member might shock you too, it's quite a lot that the government has to cough up and other countries do not pay in equally and it becomes a one-sided agreement with UK Germany France and other big countries contributing more. [This](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036097.stm) link from the BBC might show you how much each country contributes. Margaret Thatcher got the UK a rebate in 1984 and also made many points on why the EU might not be a great idea for the UK, granted she's not a popular figure but she does raise some good points on the problem.

Also you'll see that Norway and Switzerland, two countries that are quite wealthy, are not in the European Union yet are doing quite well for themselves. The Union used to be an agreement for trade but to me and many others it's starting to look like it's going to become one big country.

My personal view is that the EU should be between very few countries, and that around the 1990s it turned into some charity to help less wealthier countries in Europe.

Europe in the 1600s was not the democratic utopia many ITT seem to be comparing it with. Most states in Europe had laws favouring one religion over the other and that was prior to the introduction of the penal laws here. It was power politics simple as that.

When the Presbyterians had a few laws made against them, it was very much about the Dublin ruling class limiting an alternative power base on the northern chunk of this rock.

The writer goes to great lengths expounding the fact the pope was on King Billy's side. Irrelevant to Irish loyalists seeking survival for their own way of life in a land that had seen violent rebellion not so long ago. In fact 3 years later the old pope was back on the other side of the fence supporting a rival contender for the throne of Britain &amp; Ireland, a fact that in all likelihood sped up the introduction of religious laws in the Dublin parliament.

Anarchists for instance don't support any government spending at all. A union will normally always resist cuts and support more jobs for its sector regardless of wider macro economic considerations.

Are you asking about the Labour party? I think a lot of us wouldn't really consider them ""Left.""

But if you're making the point that many people don't support (or perhaps aren't even aware of) the Keynesian idea of spending more when private sector spending is down and scaling back public sector spending when private sector spending is high yeah I'm sure that's true. My impression is that people who like cuts like cuts in any macro economic circumstance and people who oppose cuts oppose them all the time.

Although it is difficult to measure how many people reside in the UK without authorisation, a Home Office study based on Census 2001 data released in March 2005 estimated a population of between 310,000 and 570,000.[1]

More recently, a study carried out by a research team at LSE for the Greater London Authority estimated the undocumented migrant population of the UK by updating the Home Office study. The LSE's study takes into account other factors not included in the previous estimate, namely the continued arrival of asylum seekers, the clearance of the asylum applications backlog, further undocumented migrants entering and leaving the country, more migrants overstaying, and the regularisation of EU accession citizens.

The most significant change in this estimate is however the inclusion of children born in the UK to undocumented migrants. For the LSE team undocumented migrants oscillate between 417,000 and 863,000, including a population of UK-born children ranging between 44,000 and 144,000. Drawing on this and taking stock of the outcome of the recent Case Resolution Programme, a University of Oxford's study by Nando Sigona and Vanessa Hughes estimate at end 2011 a population of undocumented migrant children of 120,000, with over half born in the UK to parents residing without legal immigration status.",null,0,null,1433674324,null,0,false,0,crybt32,null,t3_38vy6b,null,t1_crybt32,null,t1_crybh5j,null,null,null,1436792194,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Coming from military involvement myself, I can tell you that few men in the forces ever consider themselves heroes. You could consider his high kill count as a heroic act, but his job is purely to kill people. Even an infantry rifleman on the ground spends more time digging holes than shooting people. Snipers are there to kill. They have high kill counts. But they aren't ""god damned bad asses"", they're men and women doing their job in a war we shouldn't have been involved in.

As for saving lives, you could consider every single active soldier who's served in a front for saving lives. Their job consistently puts their lives on the line, and because he killed a number of enemy forces doesn't make him a life saver or special as a result. They save each others lives as a daily job on the front. Digging a foxhole saves lives, putting up hesco walls saves lives, reloading the machinegun of a sentry saves lives, even the guys in the back, planning operations properly, save lives. 

Yes, I agree 110% that rehabilitation and duty of care should stretch outside of the battlefield, and it does.

It also undermines UK wages because graduates become desperate and will take any job regardless of pay. While qualified immigrants command huge rates.


The only thing the UK would change would be to restrict lowly skilled immigrants from EU. Which would likely lead to huge labour shortages, inflation on everyday goods, less tax revenue and growth. The only thing that keeps the UK afloat right now is that inflation is rock bottom.

One thing I'd disagree with you about I'd that the country is over 50% right wing.

The Tory vote has been diminishing for years,  and the current surge in popularity with ukip which would psuh the right Wong parties over 50% is not down to a massive shift in favour of right wing parties, most kippers and most of the electorate when polled were in favour of re nationalising the utilities which is pretty left wing, also ukip gained a lot of votes due to working class labour and left wing voters wanting an end to working class wage devaluation via European mass immigration. 
Ostensibly these are still left wing working class, they are just listening to the *only* party willing to stop mass immigration, unfortunately it happens to be a right wing party.
Once the EU referendum is settled ukip should dissolve and its voters return to their core party.

&gt;__Fisherian__ or __Fisher's runaway__, first proposed by [R. A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Fisher) in the early 20th century, is a hypothesized genetic [selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection) mechanism for the [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of exaggerated male ornamentation (a subtype [secondary sexual characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sexual_characteristics)) observed in numerous [sexually reproducing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_reproducing) [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species); based upon the preference (or attraction) of females for ornamented male mates (known as [female choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_choice)).      

&gt;The [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of male ornamentation, an example being the colourful and elaborate [peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl) [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) compared to the relatively subdued [peahen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl) plumage, represented a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) for evolutionary biologists in the period following [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and leading up to the [modern evolutionary synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis); the selection for costly ornaments appearing incompatible with [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection). Fisherian runaway is an attempt to resolve this paradox using an assumed genetic basis for both the preference and the ornament, and through the less obvious but powerful forces of [sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection) (a sub component of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)). Fisherian runaway hypothesizes that females choose ""attractive"" males with the most exaggerated ornaments based solely upon the males' possession of that ornament. According to Fisher, if strong enough, female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection if the ornament under sexual selection is otherwise non-adaptive (naturally selected against). Fisher hypothesized this counteraction would result in the next generation's male offspring being more likely to possess the ornament (and female offspring more likely to possess the preference for the ornament) than the previous generation. Over subsequent generations this would lead to the runaway selection (via a [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) mechanism) for males who possess the most exaggerated ornaments.   

&gt;Fisherian runaway sought to explain the paradox of male ornamentation but neither the mechanism nor the secondary sexual characteristic or preference is restricted to this system: Fisherian runaway can be applied to include [sexually dimorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_dimorphic) [traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait) and [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_structure) such as behaviour and structural displays expressed by either sex.

I've worked at a Merlin Attraction previously for three years and have operated rides myself. They were very strict over safety protocols during my time there and have always served the rides well in making them as safe as possible. Also, the cheek of this woman asking Varney if he knows if someone lost a leg. Even if he DID know, its is highly unethical to give patient information without consent of the patient and should know better.

&gt; __Charlton Hayes__ is a mixed use development located on a land north of the [Filton Airfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filton_Airfield) and it is a new extension to [Patchway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patchway).  Planning permission was granted by the South Gloucestershire Council in 2008 to build 2,200 homes for 6,000 residents. Charlton Hayes was named after the original village of [Charlton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton,_Bristol), which was demolished to make way for the [Filton Airfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filton_Airfield).

&gt;__Obdulio Jacinto MuiÃ±os Varela__ (Spanish pronunciation:Â [oÎ²ËÃ°uljo Î²aËÉ¾ela]; September 20, 1917 â August 2, 1996) was a [Uruguayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_people) [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) player. He was the captain of the [Uruguayan national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team) that won the [1950 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup) after beating [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team) in the decisive final round match popularly known as the *[Maracanazo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_v_Brazil_(1950_FIFA_World_Cup\))*. He was [nicknamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname) __""El Negro Jefe""__ (__The Black Chief__) because of his dark skin and the influence he had on the [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_pitch), especially during the unlikely victory over Brazil. He was of [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Uruguayan), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people) and [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) ancestry. Commonly regarded as one of the greatest classic [holding midfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder), Varela was adept in [defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) and was renowned for his tenacity and leadership.

This is rather a sweeping statement that blurs several lines. I worked in a UK-based, pan-European company that sold in the entire EU. In that statement you're confusing commercial issues with marketing. Marketing to different countries would remain the same whether the UK is in the EU or not; the same way that savvy companies market products differently between different areas of the UK. And employment law is already different in each country in the EU, so terms of employment for employees from different countries won't change either if we leave.

The commercial difference would be that dealing with the Eurozone we only ever had to worry about the currency. Excise duty didn't exist and VAT was harmonised: get an EU-compliant VAT number and just throw it into the accounts. Start trading in the UK and you can instantly, legally, sell across the entire EU with no tax or duty worries.

If we were outside the EU we as the UK would either have to negotiate special trade deals with each individual member country, and then companies that did business into the EU would be required to comply with each one individually (a nightmare) or we'd have to negotiate something with the Eurozone as a whole - and do you really think France and Germany would make things easy for us to do that..?

null,false,imthatoneguyyouknow,null,null,null,"Yep. I was born in '88 in the Netherlands, so I grew up in the wilderness years (when the show wasn't being produced), in a country that wasn't overly familiar with the show, although the iconography of the Tardis, Tom Baker and the Daleks was pretty well known. My first real exposure to the show was somewhere in 2000, when I read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy for the first time (at the perfect age, I think). It made a huge impact on me, and made me seek out every single thing Douglas Addams had worked on - including his Doctor Who episodes. Having City of Death as your first ever Doctor Who story is pretty awesome. I fell in love with the format, and checked out some of the other stuff out there, but not a lot. 

The lead up to the modern version of the show got me interested because of that early experience with the Tom Baker stories, and I watched all the episodes from Christopher Eccleston onwards (including the Sarah Jane and Torchwood stuff, and all the little mini episodes for stuff like Red Nose Day and the Proms). I loved, loved the format, a lot of the episodes and the actors, but I couldn't stand some of the episodes of the Eccleston/Tennant years. Some made me quit for a few months until I caught up again, with some standalone excellent episodes making up for the - for me - huge amount of disappointing episodes.

Then the news broke that Moffat would take over the show with Matt Smith. Got excited again, and completely loved everything about the show starting in season 5. It was exactly what I wanted to be - what I expected from a modern series semi-based on the style of Douglas Addams. Although I do agree that Moffat hit some bumps in the road after that season, I still enjoy most of it, and that 5th season really was something very special at the time. It was around that time that I went back and watched everything from the beginning - including reconstructions of missing episodes, weird side-projects like Curse of Fatal Death and the failed pilot for the K9-spinoff. So yeah, I watched all of it. Never read any of the books, and only a couple of the comics/Big Finish audio's, but there's a lot of that, and while I love the show I'm worried it'll just get to be too much if I tried to do all of that as well. I do have a feeling I'll get to a lot of the Big Finish stories at some point though. 

All in all the first complete watch took me around 2 years, but that included some long periods where I didn't watch anything at all - if only to keep myself sane. I'm actually doing a second watchthrough now (I guess trying to keep myself sane didn't work), and I'm currently at Tom Baker's second season. I actually enjoy it even more this time around - some stories I completely forgot about, and some I enjoy even more. Especially Pertwee took me by surprise - I didn't think much of him the first time I watched it, but I can see his appeal now. 

For the record, after watching all of it my favorite Doctors are Throughton, Tom Baker (during the first half of his run that is), Davison and Matt Smith, with a special shout out to Hartnell (I have a soft spot for the 60s episodes). Capaldi is great too, but I want to see more of him before I can compare him to the others.

Internet: This is usually bundled with your phoneline so expect to pay around Â£16 a month line rental and Â£5-Â£15 internet depending on who you go with as some do it with tv packages etc.

Mobile: depends if on a contract/SIM only/if you get a phone as part of the deal but 2,000 mins, 5,000 texts and 3GB of 4G data for Â£15/mth with ID mobile (Carphone warehouse's brand).

You will get to pick your tenants and look them in the eye before you let them move in!
Legal stuff, plenty of on line resources
You will need a tenancy agreement, find one on line.
research what it takes to get someone out before you even put them in.

Our fitness levels were good, but at what cost to the players?  Wasn't our injury record pretty poor back then?  The technical development of our younger players was also pretty poor.  If you over-train young players by running them up a hill over and over, they don't have the energy left for technical work.  They also pick up constant niggles etc.

Incidentally, Rafa changed our fitness and training and made it lighter in pre season so we could make a better start, resulting in the season where we came 2nd . We had a regime which although benefited us by the end of season, it didn't help us make a good start.


I do think Rafa could have benefitted from a certain model of coach in his backroom team, and he put the right types in place in the academy just before he left.  I think he had a period where he was doing too much as he didn't have someone on his level or wave length.

I'm not convinced Pako is the man for Rodgers.

Do you realise there's a problem right now, that we can't continue to just land boat load after boat load of illegal immigrants from wherever they feel like coming from in Africa or the Middle east? This can not continue as it is. There *must* be a solution.

&gt;The ""Solution"" you described is unworkable and violates international law no matter how you cut it.

It's not unworkable in the slightest, and if it violates international law the the EU as a collective of 28 nations should withdraw multilaterally from whichever laws we're said to be in violation of. We are sovereign nations.

&gt;In the Libyan war zone? 

Wherever they set off from.

&gt;Surely that counts as penalties, on a fucking island prison like Australia does?

That would work very well too if we could find a decent island for it. A bit more expensive but possibly simpler.

&gt;Surly imprisonment counts as penalties. 

So basically everything short of ""Welcome to Europe, the North is that way"" is a penalty...we just have to keep accepting hundreds of thousands of Africans and Middle Eastern economic migrants pouring into Europe every year and you've got absolutely nothing to say about the issue except that any possible solution is wrong.

&gt;The treaty specifically forbids returning them there in the event they are legitimately in danger.

They're *all* in danger just by being in Libya. We're not taking all of them, and as I say, if that violates international law then we should multilaterally withdraw from those treaties.

&gt;Take them in, give them temporary accommodation, process their claims, grant asylum or deport as necessary. Only way to do it.

Except most of them don't wait to be granted asylum they just disappear off into Europe and live illegally, 'cos lets face it we all know the majority of them aren't getting asylum even with our overly lenient system as it is.

If you want to blame this on anyone blame it on the economic migrants who abuse the asylum system.

null,false,ir_h,flair8,,null,"Jan Vertonghen plans to agree a new contract and stay at Tottenham Hotspur next season.

The defender has one year left on his deal but the club have the option to extend it by two more seasons. Talks over a new contract broke down last summer and the Belgian, who earns about Â£35,000 a week, was linked with a move to Napoli in Italy.

âI think Iâll stay,"" he said today. âThatâs one of those typical rumours doing the rounds every summer. Thereâs no way Iâm leaving.""

Tottenham moved to shore up a defence that was the joint-fifth worst in the league this season by signing Kevin Wimmer from Cologne last week. He will compete with Vertonghen and Eric Dier for a starting spot. There are doubts about the future of Federico Fazio while YounÃ¨s Kaboul is expected to leave.

âIt is not the intention that they will replace me,"" Vertonghen said. âIn the past five-six years I have had different guys next to me. This season there was finally more stability with either Dier or Fazio.""

Vertonghen has been named Belgium captain for the friendly against France on Sunday and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales a week on Friday.

He urged Tottenham not to sell Hugo Lloris, the goalkeeper who he faces on Sunday, amid speculation that Manchester United will try to sign him if David De Gea moves to Real Madrid.

âHeâs a great guy, great captain, great goalkeeper and a brilliant player for us. Heâs the captain and heâs very important. This season he was one of our best players. Heâs been outstanding for us. If you want to continue growing as a club you have to keep your best players. Hugo is one of them.

Okay, lets see.

We can stop the deliberate collapse of Sterling and the poverty planned for us by the EU.
 
Stop the waste on the EU's control structures in Britain, particularly its 8,500 quangos costing Â£167 billion annually â the biggest single treasury expenditure. 
 
Abolish the EUâs Common Purpose control organisation and its 30,000 UK âleadersâ.
Stop paying Â£100 billion pa implementing EU regulations
Stop losing Â£35 billion annually trading with the EU
Throw out the EU quangos in the NHS costing Â£50 billion pa.
 
-which will put our budget into massive surplus. (The EU wastes Â¼ of our economy)
 
Let the poor finally participate in the economy. The EU has just denied them the biggest boom in history. If we had taken back our money the EU has forcibly wasted in Britain each year, we could have used it to quadruple wages for the poor instead.
Abolish income tax for those on under Â£25,000pa, with automatic RPI increase each year. 
 
Abolish the EUâs VAT, and its 120,000 regulations, returning freedom to business and people.
 
Stop 3 million EU immigrants arriving a year  â put our old border controls back.
Stop the hundreds of EU Frankfurt School subversion techniques. Including:
Restore the family which the EU is busy destroying. Reverse the trend to single mothers.
 
Throw out our corrupt, EU appointed judges, bring justice back to our now rotten courts.
 
Abolish the secret family courts that snatch 4,500 attractive children annually from good families for forced adoption. (Frankfurt School social engineering)
 
Stop the EUâs subversion of the NHS with continual change and other Frankfurt techniques.
Rebuild our armed forces, which the EU has been deliberately destroying.
Throw out the corrupt, unchristian leaders of the Church of England.
 
Throw out our corrupt top politicians, all of whom are in the pay of the EU.
 
Strengthen the British Constitution, take power back from government by submitting Bills to public ballot annually before Royal Assent.
 
We will then experience unparalled freedom, democracy and prosperity in Britain, still the worldâs fifth largest economy among its 205 nations.

Firstly, a UK exit would make the Union poorer â Britain is the worldâs fifth largest economic power, the biggest destination for foreign investment in the bloc and pays more into the EUâs coffers than it gets back.

Secondly, it would make the EU weaker on the world stage. The 28-member club would lose a nuclear-armed, permanent member of the UN Security Council, which â along with France â is the only other EU country able to protect and project its values by force. Finally, the departure of free-trading Britain would make the EU more prone to supporting state aid for ailing industries and over-generous subsidies for farmers â two policies that were as wrong when the UK joined the Union in 1973 as they are now.

Those who would like to see the back of Britain, like Rocard, argue that London has ânever, ever allowed even the smallest step towards greater integrationâ - conveniently forgetting that the UK championed the EUâs first major treaty change, the Single European Act.

They paint a picture of the UK as a wrecker â despite it being behind some of the EUâs biggest success stories â such as the single market, the smashing of state monopolies and the enlargement of the EU to extend the Unionâs zone of peace and prosperity eastwards.

Letâs not forget that when 10 mainly former communist countries joined the EU in 2004, Britain was one of only three countries to welcome their workers from day one.

True, Britain has opposed many moves towards further EU integration â such as monetary union. But who would seriously argue that the single currency has made citizens in Eurozone states richer and the EU a more cohesive, prosperous club? Besides, when it comes to actually applying EU laws â rather than calling for new ones to be added â Britain is always near the top of the league table, with Belgium, Italy and other more happy-clappy EU states languishing way behind it. Remember, it was France and Germany that ripped up the Stability and Growth Pact that was meant to police the Eurozone.

Successful relationships are built as much on differences as similarities.
Britain will always stand out from the rest of Europe because of its peculiar geography (an island nation that looks as much to the Atlantic as the continent), its history (a former colonial power not invaded since 1066), its politics (an old democracy that never flirted with fascism or communism) and what former French leader Charles De Gaulle called its âvery original habits and traditionsâ (pragmatists, not philosophers; common, not Roman law.)",null,0,null,1433688110,null,0,false,0,cryfpdj,null,t3_38vy6b,null,t1_cryfpdj,null,t1_cryd2bs,null,null,null,1436794906,null,42,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,42,null

They paint a picture of the UK as a wrecker â despite it being behind some of the EUâs biggest success stories â such as the single market, the smashing of state monopolies and the enlargement of the EU to extend the Unionâs zone of peace and prosperity eastwards.

Letâs not forget that when 10 mainly former communist countries joined the EU in 2004, Britain was one of only three countries to welcome their workers from day one.

True, Britain has opposed many moves towards further EU integration â such as monetary union. But who would seriously argue that the single currency has made citizens in Eurozone states richer and the EU a more cohesive, prosperous club? Besides, when it comes to actually applying EU laws â rather than calling for new ones to be added â Britain is always near the top of the league table, with Belgium, Italy and other more happy-clappy EU states languishing way behind it. Remember, it was France and Germany that ripped up the Stability and Growth Pact that was meant to police the Eurozone.

Successful relationships are built as much on differences as similarities. Britain will always stand out from the rest of Europe because of its peculiar geography (an island nation that looks as much to the Atlantic as the continent), its history (a former colonial power not invaded since 1066), its politics (an old democracy that never flirted with fascism or communism) and what former French leader Charles De Gaulle called its âvery original habits and traditionsâ (pragmatists, not philosophers; common, not Roman law.)",null,0,null,1433688481,null,0,false,0,cryfuoz,null,t3_38vy6b,null,t1_cryfuoz,null,t1_cryb76d,null,null,null,1436795000,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It is not the Euro sclerosis â the fact that the trade block we joined in the early 1970s which then accounted for 36 percent of world GDP, will account for less than 15 percent in 2020. It is not even really about the anti-democratic nature of having decisions made for you in Brussels. Today, for example, we learn that unelected and unaccountable Eurocrats want to prevent us from asking if those claiming benefits in Britain are entitled to them.

No. The reason we need to quit the EU is even more elemental than all that.

Put simply, Europe cannot best be organised by deliberate design. From the Common Fisheries Policy to the common currency, being part of the EU means trying to do things according to some kind of âblue printâ determined by a Brussels elite. It makes things more or less bound to go wrong. Indeed, the more insulated from public accountability the Euro System has become, the more inept it is.

By withdrawing from the EU, we would make it possible to organise economic and social affairs in this country not by deliberate design from the top down, but more organically and spontaneously. From the bottom up. Instead of common financial service rules, we might instead allow competing exchanges to offer different approaches and see which one works. Rather than a Common Agricultural Policy for millions of farmers, we might, you know, allow millions of farmers to each have their own farm policy for their farm.

In an increasingly networked and interdependent world, the more successful societies are those that allow more decentralised decision making, by harnessing and balancing opposing forces. Britainâs refusal to be reconciled to being in the EU is not ultimately anything to do with flags or anthems. Itâs because we know in our bones that it is a daft way to run a whole continent.

Oh you poor naive fool. There was a guy who posted a couple of years ago on Reddit. I asked him how he was doing at uni as he was doing the course I was thinking of. He asked how I knew and I just found out doing a little research. I even PM'd him his name. 

Applying it to you briefly... You're Scottish so that narrows it down to around 5.2 million people. Male so just discarded 50% of the population just by working that out so we're down to around 2.6 million. 18 years old given your age and the fact you stated you did Int Level 2 maths 2 years previously. So in 5 minutes of just looking through a few pages of your Reddit posts I've now narrowed it down to around 30,000 people given there were 59,440 born in Scotland in the year you were, half of which will have been female. Now we go further. You're from the Glasgow area, given your posts about your accent most likely born there. So that narrows it down to a male born in the Glasgow area in 1996/97, working in IT in a technical role earning around Â£10k a year, educated to college level or about to be, have a food safety certificate,. That's got me down to a few hundred people. You like MMORPGs as well so that narrows down the search field even more and I'm barely 10 pages and 2 weeks into your posting history on Reddit.

The flat is only worth ~Â£100k.  In the same building, a nicer flat with balcony went for Â£115k, and a smaller one bed was on the market for ~Â£89k.

I have ~Â£28k in my own savings; the amount I have spent on renting this place could easily have topped up my deposit to the point where I could have bought the flat on a ~Â£65k mortgage.

Paying off that Â£65k using my current rent of Â£575pcm would take roughly 9 years and four months *excluding overpayment*.  Instead, I'm shovelling money into a black hole.

Bielsa is undoubtedly a madman to most people -- moreso given the line between that and ""genius"" is often murky at best -- but are people really thinking that Bilic isn't a solid step up from the quality of manager we've had in the past?

Everything about him  just makes more sense to me.  He's far more used to working with budget constraints, so no fights every six months about transfer funds because he thinks he needs 75M quid.  He's got a rather large support following in the club already because he played for us, so this gets the board back in the fans' graces.  He's young enough that he won't come at a premium price (compared to what we would have had to pay Emery, Ancelotti, Bielsa, or who-the-fuck-ever), and new enough at his craft that he has room to grow and develop with the club.

Then, you can find out the total of class A's and class B's scores combined by doing 55 times by 72 to give you **3960**.

Now, to find out the total of just class B's score you have to take away the total of class A's score from the overall score which is; **3960 - 1695 = 2265**

null,false,Dread_Knight,ukdotanet,Professional Indian,null,"Dunno about sketchy, seems poorly thought out and strange, doubt I'll be putting a team in for it, highly doubt the better UK teams will enter either.

Not sure why they've decided to start a tournament without a website, no proper press releases outside of a post on reddit, specifically looking for ""amateur and university teams"". I really don't get it, not sure why someone would want university teams to play in a tournament given that they are all really awful (even Beesa's team would lose to some of the worse UK stacks because of the skill of the rest of his team, and we all know how good Beesa is). This is obviously outside of specifically university tournaments where there's an actual interest and motive behind wanting University teams to play.

There's no proof that the ""tier 1/2"" teams have signed up, no mention of who they are, this to me screams he's winging it. No idea what motivation they'd have to play university level UKDota teams.

What's the coaching about? Do you win coaching? Does it happen automatically?

People should be wary of dodgy cups since Player Unlocked has turned out to be a total shitfest and stuff like eSports Portal tournament have had people invest time into it for the promise of great prizes yet when it comes down to it they haven't sorted it out, I don't care if you're not asking for money, time is just as valuable. A tournament organiser scamming his participants is about more than taking money from us, his lack of understanding for this is worrying.

It also really seems like he has no idea about the scene (Dota2 not UKDota) but that's just what I get from the way he's talking about ""tier 1 / tier 2 teams"", could be his poor phrasing, not relaly sure.

tl;dr Tournament seems poorly though out and I'm dubious as to whether any of the *prizes* (games against t1 teams, Â£1000, coaching from pros) are even legitimate and sorted out. Also seems to be written by someone either with really poor English or he's intentionally trying to be vague, both of which are pretty massive red flags.

A lot of money can be saved by living with others (For example in Portsmouth where I happen to live if you share with students you can easily take rent down to 330 before council tax). 

Food depends entirely on what you eat and how much of it you cook yourself, you could probably spend as little as 100 and as much as 300 but 200 is a very reasonable estimate, if not a little high for someone who cooks their own meals. 

Bills will vary if you live on your own or with others as well. As a basic example in a terraced house between 5 my house payed Â£346.82 for Electricity and Â£219.91 for Gas been the start of October and the end of February this year. 

A top tier internet connection (100mbps fiber) will set you back ~30, Phone bill will vary depending on your provider and if you include a phone with it or buy one separately, currently I pay 15 a month for Unlimited 4G, texts and quite a few minutes from 3 on a sim only contract, you could realistically get an Unlimited calls, texts and Data plan with a new top phone for ~50. 

Transport is a lot harder to generalize. An all year pass for the underground is about 3000 last I remember but traveling on rail out in the country between towns can be much much cheaper, make sure to buy a railcard if you're eligible.

Banks effectively create money when people take out a loan. They do not lend out money in the form of deposits, they can more or less make it from nothing when someone wishes to borrow it.

From the 80s until 2009 banks had to hold a reserve of money that was decided by an agreement with the Bank of England and entirely *voluntary.* This limited how much they could actually lend out.

They no longer have any reserve requirements at all. Consequently, as long as people ask a bank for a loan, it can create it and issue it. Every time someone takes out a mortgage, that money is created. That's why no measure will be taken to drastically reduce house prices.

But a stupid_user behaviour after the fact has no bearing on whether Shapps was involved in editing his own articles.

Muslims in the UK are generally descended from Arabs/Asians/North Africans. Your average EDL thug probably doesn't have the mental capacity to distinguish between a Pakistani Muslim or a Moroccan Muslim, all he sees is a Muslamic Terrorist. As far as he is concerned they are all the same.

Muslims do tend to have a common culture/history and they tend to speak one of a handful of languages (Arabic/Urdu/Turkish for instance and perhaps Somali/Nigerian).

Of course there is. There's this thing called ""the internet"" and ""the world wide web"" which has massively increased collaboration worldwide since Maastricht.

If you are making your decision on collaboration based primarily on how to extract the most amount of money possible then you're not doing what is best. 

&gt; most of the time it wouldn't be a case of settling for second best.

When it comes to research, especially really important research, you should never be settling for second best. Second best can cost MORE money than going for the best that cost more.

No, the cultural norms of the country and the event applies. That's why he was found guilty. Spanish is not a culture.

&gt;Your point about use of the terms ""blackie"", ""whitey"", ""fatso"" and so on in Rio Platenese ignores that words are not in and of themselves offensive. The intent of the speaker is what makes something offensive.

So, if I was from Nazi Germany and it was my tradition to say ""Jew"" instead of the person's name when I traveled abroad it's okay because it's my culture as long as the person is not offended himself? It's about as ridiculous.

I don't know if you noticed but none of these names are compliments. I've seen this type of language lead to so much misunderstandings and trouble. Maybe a black man can use the N-word (in English) to another black man from his own culture, but that was definitely not the case for Suarez, he was in a different culture where he had been for long enough to be able to understand that it was offensive plus the fact that he's not black himself.

And calling every overweight person you see ""fatso"" like they usually do is actually always offensive, whether the target agrees to it or not. Do you think that we should start with that behavior in the west as well? Look for the quickest and lowest way to judge a person by his appearance and throw it in his face. It can be said affectionately but certainly not all the time and you should be cautious to use words like these for a stranger on the street, and especially to someone you're arguing or fighting with.

I have a friend that is American with Philippine heritage and he's been in fist fights over being called ""Chino"" in the South American culture, since it's a big insult to him. Does he have the right to be offended?

And this type of slang has little to do with Rio Platanese, it's the same at least in the Spanish speaking parts of South and Central America.

&gt;This was a complicated case that's particularly nuanced. This is a good read if you want to learn more about it

I have already read about it extensively back when it happened and I don't believe one word of what Suarez said in his semantic defense. Suarez and Evra are two hot heads and there's no doubt that Suarez used the word ""negro"" more than once, and that it was not used friendly while arguing and tugging at each other in the penalty area and that he followed up by pinching Evra's black skin. There was no reason for Evra to be making all this up. You are a delusional fool if you believe that whether it made it into the report or not. If he said ""Porque tu eres negro"" or ""Por quÃ©, negro?"" is irrelevant to me in that context, do you get it?",null,0,null,1433698463,null,0,false,0,crykidd,null,t3_38udfj,null,t1_crykidd,null,t1_cryaowq,null,null,null,1436798629,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

null,false,veldtfotter,,Year 11,null,"As /u/TheAlborghetti explained below, it works in a Dual Award, or Double Award system. This means that you take both a Core Science and Additional Science award, which is essentially 2 GCSE certificates and awards, depending on the grade you got. The same for which Triple goes, except you have a Triple Science award which in turn, gives three GCSE grades.

As to how the grading system, there is a few routes into this: One is a subject-based paper and an ISA, which goes as follows (This is known as Route 1 4405):

25% Biology (Based Upon B1, B2 and B3 and the scores you get depending on the exams you take)

25% Chemistry (Based Upon C1, C2 and C3 and the scores you get depending on the exams you take)

25% Physics (Based Upon P1, P2 and P3 and the scores you get depending on the exams you take)

25% ISA or Independent Skills Award IIRC. This is coursework and what you must have done in class, with two exams, a section one and section two paper which equates to a total of 50.

Altogether, this goes in the score of (60 for Bio + 60 for Chemistry + 60 for Physics + 50 for ISA) 230 RAW, and a total of 400 in UMS I believe, which makes up a total grade for what you do.

There is another route, called Route 2 I believe. Also known as 4406, this is based upon a mixed science paper and a controlled assessment, and goes as follows:

35% Science A1 (Based upon B1.1 to B1.3, C1.1 to C1.4, P1.1 to P1.3)

40% Science A2 (Based upon B1.4 to B1.8, C1.5 to C1.7 and P1.4 to P1.5)

25% ISA or Independent Skills Award IIRC. This is coursework and what you must have done in class, with two exams, a section one and section two paper which equates to a total of 50.

Altogether, this goes in the score of (90 for 1, 90 for 2, 50 for ISA) 230 RAW, and a total of 400 in UMS I believe, which makes up a total grade for what you do.

The UMS is essentially the score that is mashed together from all papers and 'doubled' (not true, but is similar) to get a total score of 400. This is then how the grade boundaries are decided. For more info on UMS, check [here](http://store.aqa.org.uk/over/stat_pdf/UMS-GRADE-BOUNDARIES.PDF)

In contrast to your statement that the voters would be disinclined on the basis of a drop in house prices, when the majority of their voter base is rural and predominately unaffected by house prices in comparison to the urban vote. 

Whether *you* ultimately think that the role of debt in the economy is true or not, and whether it is indeed at all the case within the economy is irrelevant.

Personally, I would say the main issue is that Muslims don't feel part of British society. They feel that they go along with it, but never part of it.

Constant demonising by media worsens the issue. They feel that the society is against them and they won't even feel bad for joining an enemy if it ever came to it because of course, they were actually never part of them. It's 'we vs them' mindset that is creating the issue.

Foreign policies in middle east make it easier for propagandas to portray the west as an enemy murdering Muslims.

The basic position is the centre, and for the test, that's generally where they want you to be.  
There are always exceptions - for instance, if there's a line of parked cars on the opposite side of the road that makes that lane narrower, it's the polite thing to do to move over to the left more. We can keep moving, and it allows cars travelling in the other direction to continue on too. You just do a life saver before shifting position.  
Another example is if I see kids/animals playing at the side of the road - I'll shift over, to give myself more time to react if they jump out to the road.",null,0,null,1433701831,null,0,false,0,crym8hm,null,t3_38mzg9,null,t1_crym8hm,null,t1_crwpflk,null,null,null,1436800101,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

&gt; Actually, the book that Keynes wrote attacking the treaty, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, was very substantially about the economic consequences of &amp;quot;Imposed austerity&amp;quot;.

&gt; If the point of view that Ferguson airs is basically right, the imposed austerity we are going through is not a useless nightmare, but more like a strenuous workout for a healthier future, as the champions of austerity have always claimed.

&gt; We were in effect being told that if you want economic reform then you must also have, along with it, economic austerity, although there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the two must be put together as a chemical compound.

In Denmark for instance I couldn't claim any unemployment benefit because you have to work for a year to claim it. Benefits are not a reason to leave the EU, they are problems we can easily solve within the EU without changing any treaties. The problem is our benefits have no requirements so we have to give them to short term EU migrants too. 

I think so, my politics is much more aligned with EU politics &amp; groups are better represented under the PR system so I support the work the parliament does. I think if we had a PR system there would be less need for certain EU directives on employment law &amp; environmental standards. I also think migrants are a net positive for the UK &amp; our investment in the EU goes to the poorer countries which develop &amp; buy more of our goods, so I don't see the money as wasted. In some ways our contribution to the EU budget is a little like foreign aid, so perhaps we could cut that budget slightly to compensate. I also think we'll get a much better deal in trade with countries like America due to our larger negotiating position.

I have somehow, since leaving ""home"" at 18 (that's what happened in the olden days, kids) managed to pay for my accomodation. Sometimes the money came from the taxpayer (how that makes you gullible worker bees resentful) in the form of housing benefit and sometimes from work or a combination of the two. Most people, come what may, pay for their accommodation. 

Now, why is the system not set up so that everyone is awarded a mortgage automatically at the age of 18 by the government or with the government guaranteeing it? You would be sure the payments would be made because everyone has to pay for accommodation by hook or by crook and by the time anyone was 43 they'd own their own place.

I lived in Belgium for a short while, the situation there is really bad. There's really strong tension between Muslim and non-Muslim communities and it's getting worse. The situation in France is the same. By far, large majority of Muslims in there don't even consider themselves as French or Belgian at all.

Find the largest possible answer, then find the smallest possible answer, and then find the smallest degree of accuracy that they both agree on.

Here, to get the biggest answer *a* needs to be the largest possible number and *b* needs to be the smallest possible number (because a/b).

They give you the values of *a* and *b* to a certain degree of accuracy.

The **upper bound** of *a* is 6.435.

The **lower bound** of *b* is 5.5135

UB sqrt(a/b) = 1.080340323

Do the same again, but with the lower bound of *a* and upper bound of *b* to get the smallest answer.

Likewise upper bounds and lower bounds works the same way. Let's say you got 13 sweets but the yellow sweet company is dodgy and makes a mistake. An error nearest 3 sweets. You can have 13Â±3; 10 (lower bound) or 16 (upper bound) if you're lucky.

 Would you rather share 16 sweets with 4 people - lower bound - (16 (UB) Ã·4 (LB) ) or 10 sweets with 10 people - upper bound -  (10 (LB) Ã·10 (UB) )?

The effect of al Qaeda, and now ISIS, is that more ajd more groups have adopted a hardline Salafist or Wahabbi  ideology and embraced takirism.

In Iraq under Saddam there was hardly any Islamist presence. And even during the US occupation islamist forces that came to be known as al Qaeda in Iraq represented a small faction of the insurgency. ISIS is essentially a cooperative movement between Iraqi Baathists and Islamists from both within and outside Iraq.

The vacuum you talk about is not a result of the collapse of al qaeda, but a lack of control on the area by boyh the Iraqi and syrian governmens.

*edit*

Christ.  I'm not PAID by these companies to buy their shit.  Fine.  I'll join the circle jerk. Good job Bentalab.  Way to sign with Adidas.  I hope you also soon sign with Coke, Visa, H&amp;M and the gap.

As a side note, I do try to buy a little bit more consciously. I do try to do research into companies that I buy their products from, but sometimes supply chain management isn't the greatest.  I try not to shop at places like H&amp;M, or apple because of the child labor.  I try to buy American when I can, as it's great for the economy and you know you are buying a product not manufactured by children or slave labor.

But the question is how much is that actually that women don't actually want to do these jobs, and how much is just that women don't feel they could be able to go into these jobs as they believe its a man's job?

The problem is that prejudiced attitudes tend to be self-reinforcing. If we just let the status quo be, then it reinforces the current trend and then people think ""well politics isn't a woman's job"", so woman are discouraged from going into politics, which thus reinforces the belief that its a men's only job.

The reality is, the lib dems will probably not actively do anything to put more women into politics, but they need to make these identity politics statements to say to women ""look, contrary to how it looks, politics isn't a men's only club - if you want to go into politics you can and we very much encourage you to do so"".

In an ideal world, these statements wouldn't need to be made - you're right, it shouldn't matter. But because we are a country that has a history of oppressing women and minorities, there are social attitudes that have been ingrained into society, which bias women against taking jobs they believe to be ""men's only"" and biases employers/the public into thinking that women shouldn't be doing these jobs.

For a long time, the public felt that it wasn't a woman's place to be allowed to vote, and even once woman's suffrage happened, a lot of women felt they had to simply comply with their husband's choice because they were too inferior to make their own political decisions. That has changed, and we should encourage change in this area as well.

I have an oily tzone and surprisingly, adding an oil hasn't made anything worse, which was my biggest worry! Then I wet my hands and apply a bit of warm water and I massage it in a bit, this is where it turns into a cleansing milk and feels really light and refreshing. I then use a slightly wet cotton pad to wipe it all off. It takes every bit of makeup off, waterproof stuff, heavily applied stuff etc and it leaves your skin feeling moisturised as well. I have really sensitive skin with redness and everything stings - this does not sting! It doesn't leave your skin feeling tight either, it's brilliant.

Absolutely certainly, but I don't know if they would output more pure watts than riders of time gone by. But a lot of that is due to diet (Wiggins is a beanpole compared to Merckx), training and position. Obviously the bike is a big factor too, but just putting Eddie on one of those doesn't tell the story. 

I am just saying it would be interesting to see the wattage output of Brad, in comparison to the far less tuned brilliance of Merckx.

Remember also that Merckx was pretty much free to dope as hard as possible. Whilst I am not going to sit here and claim that Brad is certainly clean- he has never been proven like Merckx was.

That they're 'getting Britain back to work' and 'making work pay'.

The latter clearly isn't true, and the former, sure they're getting people into work.  Low paid, variable hour or part time work, ensuring they're not actually able to earn a decent amount of disposable income, and need to claim a range of benefits, often about as much as if they were unemployed, meaning it's not actually economically beneficial for the worker, only the employer.

Then there's the lack of disposable income being a huge drag factor on the economy with millions not spending.

I genuinely think we'd be better off with higher unemployment but better quality jobs for those who are working.

Perhaps combined with a DWP and Jobcentres that are interested in getting people into steady, long term careers, not just getting them off benefits by any means.

There were some talk in deaf communities in regards to being able to get foreign sign language interpreters paid for with no cost to you (if you don't pay tax) if using public services. I searched for any evidence relating to this. I wasn't able to find it for a while until today. If what I've heard is true, taxpayers are paying out over Â£100k per year in the UK for foreign sign language interpreters.

Apparently, it's really common.

Why am I doing this:

To raise the awareness for recognition of British Sign Language and to get its a legal status which it desperately needs. There is some progress in Scottish parliament but none in UK parliament despite many letters to MPs and campaign from members of deaf communities in the UK.

If BSL is given a legal status, would mean interpreters are only provided for that sign language. As it currently stands, it's not possible to refuse foreign sign language interpreter as this would breach [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).

Still a moot point. Go to lets say Korea. I bet you that the majority of the politicians will be of the predominant race. Why? Because when you have a lot of people of the same colour, there will be more of a chance that they will be elected.

Also, adding to this, the concentration of the 12% will be spread widely across the country, you will get some pockets of a lot of races but the majority will be white.

&gt; If gender so greatly effects career choice then surely it also effects political opinions, and those political opinions should be represented in Parliament. If you want a Parliament which is devolved from it's own background we might as well just take 650 civil servants or judges.

And how we can achieve this is by not forcing it to happen, it has to start from a young age, in schools. For too long schools have been afraid of teaching politics, it should be a mandatory subject in GCSE's.
