https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chapter-20-british-citizenship-by-descent-and-otherwise-than-by-descent-nationality-instructions  
  
* 20.1.1 Every person who is a British citizen is so either ""by descent"" or ""otherwise
than by descent"".
 20.1.2 The distinction between the two affects a British citizen's ability to transmit
that citizenship to children born abroad. It does not affect any of the other
rights or duties that go with British citizenship.
 20.1.3 British citizens by descent cannot transmit their citizenship to children born
abroad except in the circumstances described in Chapter 4. British citizens
otherwise than by descent automatically transmit their citizenship to children
born abroad.
20.1.4 As a general principle, people are British citizens otherwise than by descent
if they are British citizens:
• by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the United Kingdom
or the Falkland Islands before 21 May 2002; or
• by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the United Kingdom
or a qualifying territory (see Annex F to Chapter 6) on or after 21 May
2002; or
because, immediately before 21 May 2002, they were British overseas
territories citizens by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in a
qualifying territory; or
• because they were adopted, on or after 1 June 2003, in any country
under the terms of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption
1993
 20.1.5 People who are British citizens by birth or other means elsewhere are British
citizens by descent.
 20.1.6 There are a number of exceptions in the categories mentioned in 20.1.4 and
20.1.5, so this Chapter needs to be consulted in all cases where it is
necessary to know whether a person is a British citizen by descent or
otherwise than by descent.   
20.1.7 It is important to remember that no one can acquire British citizenship under
s.14 of the 1981 Act, or s.3 of the 1983 Act, or s.2(1) of the 1990 or 1996
Acts, or s.2 of the 1997 Act. British citizenship is acquired either
automatically or by registration or naturalisation under other provisions of
those Acts.
20.1.8 It is necessary to define only one category of British citizens (because all
other British citizens must without exception fall into the other category).
Because the category of those who are British citizens by descent is the
smaller of the two, s.14(1) of the 1981 Act and s.3 of the 1983 Act define
this category. Supplementary provision is made by:
• s.2(1) of the 1990 and 1996 Acts, and s.2 of the 1997 Act with regard to
the status of persons registered as British citizens under those Acts; and
• s.3(3) and s.6(2) of the 2002 Act with regard to people who became
British citizens under that Act 
3
 20.1.9 We do not normally have to concern ourselves with this when we grant
British citizenship. But some people (mostly minors) may be eligible for
registration under more than one provision. By the operation of s.14(1) of
the 1981 Act, registration under one provision may give British citizenship by
descent and, under another, British citizenship otherwise than by descent. In
such cases, we should, whenever possible, choose the one which gives
British citizenship ""otherwise than by descent"". This is made clear in the
relevant Chapters of these Instructions.*",null,0,null,1439826691,null,null,false,0,cu5yvh8,null,t3_2wjzry,null,null,null,t3_2wjzry,null,null,null,1441303283,null,2,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

Before Mourinho returned and after the Europa league win, there still wasn't any of the kind of player bashing and general pessimism among supporters as there is here. Super Frank's comments about the supporters being behind players even when they are on a downturn is very true, never have I seen the kind of talk amongst Chelsea supporters as I have in this sub for the past month or so.

lol. Seriously, asking people who were responsible for funding the terrorist campaign is barometer of neither legitimate support nor honour. 'how great the ra were'? Cringe...

&gt;Another example we have plaques and/or memorials to Bobby Sands and the hunger strikers in tons of countries, and reactions to his death show a good amount of support;

In general a hunger strike 'event' raises romantic emotions beyond the realities of regular attrocities. If these people were asked if they supported Kingsmill or the bombing campaigns that killed many civilians the numbers quoted would no doubt be a lot thinner. If all the IRA ever did was martyr themselves I'm sure worldwide opinion would be much different. I know you lifted this section from wikipedia so let's just work through those reactions...

&gt;In Europe, there were widespread protests after Sands's death. 5,000 Milanese students burned the Union Flag and chanted 'Freedom for Ulster' during a march. The British Consulate at Ghent was raided. Thousands marched in Paris behind huge portraits of Sands, to chants of 'the IRA will conquer'.

Protests by a few thousand in a population of millions while impressive in terms of the number of delusional champagne socialists recorded, it's still not widespread.

&gt;In the Soviet Union, Pravda described it...

;)

&gt;In the Republic of Ireland, Sands's death led to riots and bus burning.

In the words of Alan Partridge, that's where they make them.

&gt;Nelson Mandela was said to have been ""directly influenced by Bobby Sands"", and instigated a successful hunger strike on Robben Island.

Apparently the source for this is a 'pre-university' research paper. Not exactly sure what one of those are, but it's an interesting claim as Nelson Mandela was imprisoned in 1962 and went on hunger strike 4 years later. Obviously Sands had left Mandela with such an impression that he also took up time travel.

&gt;Over 1,000 people gathered in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral to hear Cardinal Terence Cooke offer a Mass of reconciliation for Northern Ireland

That actually seems ok on the surface, appealing for peace would have been a wise thing to do while not 'honouring the IRA'.

&gt;Iran

Are we surprised? Might as well say Gaddafi was upset too.

&gt;In Israel/Palestine, Palestinian prisoners...

And Farc, and ETA...

&gt;A large monument dedicated to Irish protagonists for independence from Britain, including Bobby Sands, stands in the Waverley Cemetery in Sydney.

A few Irish-Australians getting on like Irish-Americans.

&gt;Songs written in response to the hunger strikes and Sands's death... Bik McFarlane ...

A provo writing a ballad for another provo? Why am I not surprised that ended up on a wikipedia Irish history page.

There are rumours that he will change the party constitution to ensure his hard-left followers gain complete control and purge sitting MPs who arn't to their taste. (Big irony given how generous the other wings of the party were to him and his ability to get on the ballot)

Lab will never win an election under hard-left policies (every single Labour Prime Minister has come from the right of the party, including Attlee). But with the changes to the constitution, the centre and right of the party will never be able to get in and steer the party back to electability.

This is essentially it. We decide in Sept and that seals the fate of the movement for good. If it's Corbyn a 100 year movement comes to an end and if it's Cooper it survives.

Something else to think about: the Conservatives are amending legislation so that union members have to opt in to pay the levy. Judging from the affiliated members who have signed up to take part in this leadership election, that will be 189,703. The levy is £1, so that brings in £189,703. Down from the £2 million per annum that we're getting now.

We can't amend this legislation until we get into power - but we won't get into power with Corbyn (and sadly most of Corbyn's supporters have declared that getting into power is not important to them).

That means we need corporate donors - but Corbyn won't be able to get any, given his anti-large business rhetoric. So expect donors like Lord Sainsbury to walk away. 

Would the 610,000 participating in this leadership election be able to donate enough to fight a general election?

People think by 'supporting an English club' means I want a club to win the CL, do I fuck. It just means, hey look - it really fucking helps us in the long run if we can get the English clubs out the group stage. Maybe get two teams to the semis. 

People that say '4th spot won't help us anyway.' - 4th spot gives you a fucking LOT of money, PLUS the attraction of players abroad. If we can get CL this season and next season, the club will be on a rollercoaster upwards on every topic you can think of. Wages, players coming in, keeping hold of players (Coutinho and Firmino spring to mind within the next 2 years.) 

People are delusional if they think 4th spot doesn't matter to us.

Mmm, nope. There are multiple kinds of diabetes, and even most of those who develop Type II have a genetic tendency. 

Also bear in mind that there are many people diagnosed with Type II initially that end up having MODY (mature onset diabetes in the young - has particular genetic markers), Type 1 but a slow onset (type 1.5?) and in my families particular instance, Diabetes as a result of a mitochondrial mutation. That's not to mention the increase in the prevalence of Type 1, which is autoimmune.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10557155/Lord-Stevens-admits-police-have-been-fiddling-crime-figures-for-years.html

Consider the hammer gang in Scotland last month. A gang threatened people with a hammer while stealing a motorbike. Numerous people phoned in their concerns and to make a report. The Edinburgh police obviously sent a car to deal with this incident and they were all arrested.

Nah... the Edinburgh police denied they received any calls about this incident and pretty much said people were lying about it. 2 weeks later their lies were discovered and it was found out that the police simply deleted the records of such calls. 

Therefore if you don't record a crime it NEVER HAPPENED! No crime!

Therefore if police don't record 1 million violent crimes! Then 1 million violent crimes didn't happen!

Simples! 

This is why posts like when will the police not investigate murder come up time and again. Because the police are No criming everything. For instance Paddy when he was rammed by a car and taken for a ride on the bonnet for several miles. No crime there sir it's a civil matter!

Robbery? civil matter
Rape civil matter
Stabbing? civil matter
Theft - civil matter.

I've had problems with a few airlines over delays. Thomas Cook were undoubtedly the worst when were delayed four hours from Orlando.

We were delayed because the passenger headcount didn't match the number on the manifest (too many people were on the plane than the manifest suggested their should be). After three failed recounts, we were asked to disembark and re-board, which led to the delay.

After applying for compensation under EU261, Thomas Cook first blamed a technical failure, and then blamed weather for the delay. After many emails later, it got to the point where I downloaded data from Flightaware that showed roughly 130 departures / landings during the time Thomas Cook claimed the airport was ""closed due to thunderstorms"". Amazingly, they still wouldn't back down, insisting that the airport was closed. 

It eventually got to the point that I found the then-TC CEO (Harriet Green) on Twitter. I sent a tweet on the Tuesday night and I had a call from her PA at 9:05 the next morning. Of course, I'm not suggesting that a tweet / email to O'Leary will get a similar result. ;)

Depends if you want to be a landlord or not.  Running a private rental business isn't for everyone.

&gt; Would I need to remortgage the property?

Depends on the lender.  Assuming you take out a standard residential mortgage to start you with you would need to ask your lender for ""permission to let"" which they may or may not grant, or may only grant for a limited time.  If you can't obtain permission or your permission runs out you would need to re-mortgage onto a buy-to-let deal.  Bear in mind that BTL deals are typically more expensive and require a lower loan-to-value than residential mortgages.

Having a rental property wouldn't outright prevent you getting another mortgage to buy a primary residence although a lender will look at your overall financial position when deciding if and how much to lend.",null,0,null,1439828946,null,null,false,0,cu6090i,null,t3_3had06,null,null,null,t1_cu5z7kg,null,null,null,1441303932,null,1,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Honestly, if we went back to ""boring boring Chelsea"", I think we'd probably do just fine for a bit, but what we REALLY need is a real threat on the right wing. There's no reason that every other big club in Europe is spending right now and we're just sitting back buying bench players and loaning out our kids and not investing in the big talent that we could. City went and bought the man it takes to beat Ivan, right? Why haven't we done the same thing for a right winger? That would spread the middle out, and create more chances for Hazard and Diego as well.

Willian/RamireS are NOT a goal-scoring threat on the right side. They can be man-marked by a LB and ignored while the DM and CBs clog the center to Hazard has no where to run and Diego is too congested to settle the ball.

null,null,easywormfood,UnionFlag,"Triumph TT600, XJ600 Divvy",null,"In the industry, there are two types of accidents, NCD allow, or disallow. Under the terms of your policy, it is 99% likely that you are required to notify them about *any* incident which you *could* claim against. This means that any loss to the insurer OR yourself, where the costs are not recovered from a third party is a disallow whether you were at fault or not. If you vehicle catches fire, you're involved in a hit and run, it's stolen, you scratch the tank against something, whether you *claim or not*, this is a disallow and will stop your NCD accruing for that year. Furthermore these incidents can and normally do affect your premium.  All of this information is recorded by the company, and through programmes such as the Claims Underwriting Exchange the information is shared with participating underwriters, and not telling them is insurance fraud. You can pay extra to 'protect' your NCD (which is, I promise, a rip off).

The underwriters question for *all* the comparison sites, and most direct sales, is 'Have you or anyone who will drive under this policy had any accidents, thefts or losses in the last (X) years regardless of blame?'. If you are not declaring a TP/F/T under that question, and your insurer finds out, they will probably void your policy from inception even if they are handling an ongoing claim. 

Whether you are TPFT or Full Comp doesn't make a blind bit of difference to the way your claims are handled, accidents recorded or your NCD except that with TPFT if you chuck the bike down the road you can't claim. 

Just might be worth clarifying that you only pay excess for fire and theft claims on TPFT, and damage to your vehicle in an accident that you cause is NOT COVERED. Furthermore, if you are in an accident and found not to be at fault you don't claim under your policy but against the other person. If the other person leaves the scene, you get fuck all. 

Source: I was a fraud investigator for a multinational insurance company. 

Edit: A good example of this is a case my colleague dealt with where a guy had crashed into a BT telephone exchange, causing damage of more than £10k. The case was sent up to our team because the claims team found he had previously had a policy cancelled by another company for failing to declare a disallow incident. As we refused quotes for people who had insurance cancelled by other companies and this incident was within the last five years, the decision was taken to void the policy. Customer goes to court, council found him liable for damages and he gets an IN10 (6 points) and a 6 month ban as it took him over the 12 point threshold because he was never insured.

I think **Bentaleb** for Mason was the right call, though obviously in hindsight he went on and played like shit, but he's an all round midfielder that should have been able to handle himself.

Unfortunately, we really didn't have anyone on the bench to bring on for Kane, nor did we really have anyone suitable to move to the wing to replace Chadli or Dembele.  I think I would have actually done something a bit unorthodox.  Move Chadli to striker, but replace him with **Rose** on the left.  Rose can play on the wing, and he would have provided ample cover for Davies who was already on a yellow card.

Finally my third change would have been **Trippier** for Walker.  Walker was also on a yellow, and Stoke's only real attacking threat was on the wing.  Trippier could have brought some fresh legs into the back line and could play a bit more aggressively.

Granted, had we still lost we would have criticized my changes as being too defensive, but we really have zero options in attack.  Had Townsend been on the bench, Dembele could have moved centrally and his pace could have been extremely useful.

My expectations are along the lines of anyone between 7th-17th can beat anyone else in that bracket on their day.

My instincts are similar to yours, Villa were poo last year and finished near the bottom of the 7-17th league, whereas we finished near the top. To maintain our position in the top half of that 7-17th league we need to be beating those finishing near the bottom of that same league.

However my Palace historic brain knows that taking a point from this game is acceptable, for a non relegation season. Losing at home, to any team in the 7-20th positions means relegation potential.

Villa are similar to us in their transfer dealings. Gestede =/= Bamford / Wickham. Traore =/= Sako.

losing Delph is similar to us losing MacArthur or Punch, so they are weakened there...maybe they could buy Mutch from us!

Of course, but those historic events were brief in comparison with progress and attrition eventually changing the whole picture. In aSoIaF it spans countless generations, really.

No. The point being that the bullshit never stops because people never stop being power hungry maniacs. 

Yes, of course and it is in part a good thing: ""happily ever after"" or the good/evil division that are so popular in culture are, after all, terrible bullshit. The bad part is that GRRM has quickly run out of interesting things to do with it and his writing changed for the worse.

First: Remember that video of matic answering questions with that youtuber? He was asked, who are the hardest workers on the team? His answer, azpi and zouma. He probably would've said himself if he wasn't so humble. It's starting to show on the field.

Second: Every season we always have trouble at some point. This season it's happening now and we don't know how to feel or what to think because it hasn't happened since 98. I'd rather go through a shitty form right now and get the bullshit out of our asses right now, than suffer it later. If We have trouble now and fix it, we might not have that mid-season dip in form like we always have, and we can actually come out on top during crucial stages of cups, league, etc. Yes, there is underlying problems in our squad and performances that have been a reflection of past events and can be a foreshadowing of future events, but I'm optimistic that we're going through a tough time now so that it won't happen later, if that makes sense.

Third: Diego needs to stop being a bitch. I love diego but this isn't the only game where all he's done is bitch and complain about being touched. Goes against everything I think of him. He is an aggressive beast and there's moments in games where he's a baby. It needs to stop and he needs to start playing his football again like I've seen him play before. 

Fourth: it's great to dream and look at the future and say the kind of things like ""oh the plan for the next years is baba-cahill-zouma-azpi and then replace Cahill with stones"" but as of now we're only looking at each defender individually and how great they could play those roles but a back four needs years of playing together to develop chemistry, confidence, trust, etc. Terry and Cahill really just started excellently clicking only last season (even with cahill dipping out of form at times) with azpi and ivanovic playing basically the past 3 years with them aswell. IMO, my point explains why filipe luis got such little playing time. Along with my point, think back to when our back 4 had Terry and David Luiz in the middle. Lads. David Luiz. Terry probably had no confidence to play with him and/or no trust in him and it could explain terry's dip in form during those couple seasons/years. 

Just my 4 cents.

Not true at all, and comparing to to Marijuana where there are huge varieties of experiences possible coming from it leads me to believe you genuinely don't know what you're talking about.

MDMA releases large amounts of serotonin, thus flooding the body and having waves of euphoria happen and an increased affinity for music. It's one of the safest drugs there are, I've never known anyone to have a bad time on MDMA or an unpredictable reaction.

Take it clubbing, have the time of your life, enjoy the music, dance, gern and have an increased emotional connection.

Take it at a house party and you can talk for hours with people, connecting to them and making you more emotionally open.



You can take it around the house if you want, but you'll feel the same experience, it's the same drug every time, there's no strain like there is with Marijuana.

The only time I've ever seen anyone on reddit claim they had a bad time it's because someone had literally died and they got the phone call whilst in the emotionally vulnerable state.

MDMA is safe as fuck and it's fun as hell, before it was criminilised it was used by therapists to help marriage counseling, initially it was called Empathy because of the emotional effects it has.

Taken the right way it's less dangerous than horse riding and a lot more fun.

null,null,betafrogg,null,null,null,"So I've been on **spiro** for 2 weeks now and the whole constant peeing thing has calmed right down! Can't really report on if it' stopped my acne just yet, too soon plus it's only 25mg/ day. 

FINALLY got me some niacinamide night cream in the form of **Olay Essentials Complete Care Night Cream**. Phoned up Olay to ask what the percentage of niacinamide is (Cerave has 4%), but they wouldn't tell me for proprietary reasons QQ. C'est la vie. Bought it anyways. So let's see how it goes :D I guess, I'm just glad I decided on one and bought it instead of the constant debating. 

**Innisfree Eco Daily SPF35** is my favourite facial sunscreen esp. as it doesn't pill (nor white cast, nor oil slick, nor too matte) but I bought this as mistake and was after the SPF50 one so here's hoping the SPF50 one ticks all the right criteria too XD

Is empties a thing here? I emptied a **Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum** bottle, and got some replacements (on offer). It sure felt good to cut that bottle open and get the dregs! 

Also working on using up a few of my face sunscreens so I don't have them lying around forever. Starting with the smallest tube XD

Pretty much narrowed down the options for a vitamin C type serum, and decided to use it on alternating nights with my adapalene. But that's a next month purchase. 

I had a huge itch, and my skin was getting all flakey and sensitive from the adapalene so bought some of the **B. Clean Melting Gel Cleanser** and it's okay... I just still need to foam wash after otherwise there's just  layer of oilish residue on my face. But, OMG the gimickness of the way it suddenly gets melty on your face is sooooo fun! I want body creams and what not like this!  Just to add on from that, I also got two sample tubs of the **Clarins melting cleanser** and I got 3 uses out of one, so if anyone wants the other one let me know ;)

Overall my skin is in a really good place despite the spots I got from shaving my face a few weeks back. My PIH fades so fast now, and although it does still get to me, each months' scars aren't adding to an already existing PIH mosaic on my face. Added to that that with decent routine and set of products in place I don't get as many spots or hormonal acne it's all doing quite well. But, this journey hasn't been without tragedy. Sadly a lot of my freckles haven't survived. Freckles who have been with me since childhood, through thick and thin, the good times and the bad times. RIP, Freckles. 

Skin type: hormonal acne, occasional spots, ice pick scars, PIH, dehydrated. [Routine here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z-1dQxSIiIvk1wQLT2T47pB0fJU6x-eOZu1Eam9P4Ls/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true).

This is particularly problematic if you are a TV pundit offering your opinions and criticisms of politicians. Kane can only exist in the glorious political isolation of 'special case' Northern Ireland, where being Enoch Powell's rent boy carries no shame given the historical criminalisation of many people who now happen to be politicians. Whataboutery, basically. Gerry Adams was in the 'RA so no problem with Kane licking Powell's balls. 

He can't use the whataboutery defence if he went on Question Time though. He'd make a criticism of a politician or political party, and as soon as the audience know he used to organise for Enoch Powell, then he'd be ridiculed and vilified. It wouldn't even get that far. The rest of the UK, particularly the cities, are far too diverse to tolerate unapologetic fascist affiliates. The establishment is multicultural. The BBC has people like Alan Yentob in it, Diane Abbott is a pundit and Steven Lawrence's mum is in the House of Lords. They won't have a guy who hasn't expressed an ounce of regret in trying to facilitate a renaissance in Powell's career after his own party cut him off for being a cunt, on their TV screens. 

Your man won't even express regret at his affiliation with Powell. He's proud of it. He loves it. He thinks it was a great experience. He's a guy who attended a centenary celebration of the ""late, great"", Enoch Powell. If he could resurrect him from the dead and give him a comeback talking tour then he would. 

I know Powell did more than be a racist cunt and Ulster extremist, but in the rest of the UK, for better or worse, he is inextricably linked with being a racist cunt and his political legacy amongst the public is shat. Lie down with dogs, catch fleas; there's nothing more toxic than being associated with Powell.

Savile was not really ""allowed to get away with it"" - there were a couple of occasions when victims went to the police station and were told by the copper at the desk ""you can't go around making outrageous allegations like that"", but as much as anything that was because it was a different era, and sexual abuse (and reporting of it) wasn't really understood as it is today.

Langham was caught in an entirely less forgiving time - I think maybe you're right, and that it might've been swept under the carpet in the 70's or 80's.

For the most part Savile was evil and devious - he pandered to idiots and operated in an environment where those around him, and particularly those in authority, thought he was harmless, charming and dedicated to charity. 

Savile would adopt a superficial air of friendliness, greeting friends and new acquaintances with this fake bonhomie. As part of his charity efforts, he visited every hospital in the country - those he operated in were those where managers warmed to his manner. He'd go visiting the wards late at night, and hang around those nursing staff who thought, ""oh, isn't Jimmy nice for coming to help""; those staff who thought ""what's this weirdo up to?"" he would avoid.

Almost everyone who ""knew about"" Savile were those who avoided him - they got a creepy vibe off him, and steered clear (as he recognised their suspicion and steered clear of them). Relatively few people actually saw him actually up to anything, and they were reluctant to come forward because he was so pally with the management. That was Jimmy's whole thing - he was mates with the management, and he cultivated these relationships for decades, even giving references and recommendations, to help them up the ladder, for idiots who he already found useful.

Just as you'd dismiss allegations from a stranger about your best mate, that's how those Savile cultivated responded to those about him. You might say that you know your best mate wouldn't do that, whereas Savile is ""obviously"" creepy, but Savile picked those with bad judgement, some of whom can always be found in any large organisation like the NHS or the BBC.

On the rare occasions Savile was spotted and confronted, he would turn Jekyll-and-Hyde from his charming persona, deny everything and get threatening. ""I'll report you to you boss,"" he'd say ""we get along well together - he'll listen to me. That's slander and I'll have my lawyers on to you.""

I can't speak to any of the other cases, but Savile is not a case of everyone letting him get away with it - it's far more about the Dunning-Kreuger effect and simply how widespread human incompetence is.

Impossible choice Corbyn is forcing a debate which needed to happen and wants to challenge the Tories.  By not challenging the Tories Labour is allowing the Tories space to do whatever they wish.  

Corybn is asking the right questions but has the wrong answers to present to the UK.  In order to win we must have unity be bold in taking on the ruthless Tories.

People are not rational because what the Tories want to do is far worse compared to any Labour policy.  Only mad policy Corbyn has is his PQE which not a bad idea but method he put forward would be terrible.

In my view, I am not under false impression that Corbyn is some kind of messiah who will save the party's and the country's soul. My view is that the direction of the party has gone stale and aimless since Blair left. We lost the last two elections as we had no actual direction. As I have said to others, you can't expect an electorate to support your platform if you aren't even sure what your platform is.

As none of the candidates are electable (I mean let's not kid ourselves,  the 10-30% electability according to polls for every candidate isn't really something to be that proud of), and Labour is currently lacking a cause, purpose and direction - my thoughts are that Labour needs to be shaken hard in order to work out what platform it stands on - and that can only be done by bringing in the most radical candidate. I don't expect Corbyn will definitely lead us to victory (but who knows, let's just see what the polls say), but by electing him at least Labour will work out what the fuck it actually stands for by 2020... Corbyn is just a stepping stone on the path to reform.

I wanted Corbyn's nomination only because the party needs to have this huge debate in order to work out how it can best serve the people, and this can only happen seriously if it includes the entire Labour church. I never saw him as the most likely candidate to win, that he is looking likely was just a happy accident.",null,0,null,1439832658,null,null,1439833134,0,cu62lyd,null,t3_3haqip,null,null,null,t1_cu5rv2l,null,null,null,1441305110,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

null,null,SuffolkJason,null,null,null,"I admire the effort you've put into this. In my opinion your analysis is wrong:-

A. Jeremy Corbyn's policies are not hard-left. They are portrayed as such by the MSM but in Germany they would be seen as centrist. This undermines much of what you say. If you disagree, please indicate which of his policies are hard-left.
B. Although your analysis is intellectual it fails to take into account a change in the British public's attitude towards politics and politicians.

Let me develop those points further:-

A. Jeremy Corbyn's Policies are not ""Hard-Left"".

The mainstream media have already tried to characterise JC's policies are extreme and outdated. In fact they are relatively moderate and in line with the civilised, forward looking and admired policies of Germany:-

Is Germany a ""hard-left"" country? If these modest proposals are beyond the pale for the MSM and centrists- what should we do? Surrender or challenge?

JC Policy ideas that have been implemented in Germany:-

1. JC wants free university education
2. JC wants nationalised railways
3. JC wants to lead the world in tackling climate change (and generate a million green jobs).
4. JC wants local communities and small companies to be responsible for the majority of renewable energy
5. JC wants more emphasis on education and vocational training
6. JC wants to support and provide finance for small and medium businesses
7. JC wants unions to have more influence - in Germany union reps have a seat on the board of directors.

B. How Labour/Politicians are Perceived

The debate among Labour supporters has become polarised between the Corbyn the and Anyone But Corbyn camps. Even as a Corbyn supporter, I can see both sides of the argument:-

There are only two options for the Labour Party:-

1. Jeremy Corbyn. Elect a leader to put forward ideas and policies based on Labour values that challenge corporate power, Osbornomics and the MSM. This will be a difficult choice and Labour's economic credibility will be questioned by the MSM. It might take the whole of the five year period (2015-2020) to make the argument that there is a credible alternative to austerity and it's possible that the establishment and the MSM are just too powerful and entrenched. An uncertain future.

2. Anybody But Corbyn. Elect a leader who is prepared to appease the MSM, corporate power and Osborne's ideology. The hope would be that such a leader would get an easier ride from the MSM and that, once in power, Labour could pull levers to move away from austerity and start to rein in corporate power.

In my opinion, Option 1 allows the Labour Party to be proud of its values and allows its MP'S to speak with conviction, authenticity and authority. It would be a difficult fight and the opposition is mighty. The Labour Party has been bullied by Cameron, Osborne and the MSM since 2008- it should not appease the bullies, it should fight them head on.

Option 2 is more subtle- perhaps it has more intellectual appeal. In the late nineties it worked. The political landscape has shifted in ways that those in the Westminster bubble have not yet absorbed. The UKIP, SNP, Green and Jeremy Corbyn surges have all come as a bit of a shock to the bubble. Those in the bubble still do not fully appreciate that after years of spin, scandals, disappointments and revelations, the public want authenticity above all else. Conversely any sign of spin, not answering questions, triangulation or scheming will not be tolerated and the public (after years of exposure) can readily detect such tactics. I don't think that political commentators have yet realised that option 2 is no longer viable. They just don't get it.

In my opinion a vote for option 1 and Jeremy Corbyn is the only viable option and Labour's only real hope of winning in 2020. ",null,0,null,1439832812,null,null,false,0,cu62pmb,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,1441305157,null,8,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,8,null

He travelled all the way from his war-torn home to Calais by lorry, on foot and by taxi. “In England, they give you a home, they give you a doctor, they give you the food money,” he says. When I tell him that a single asylum-seeker such as himself gets only £36.95 a week, he is taken aback but not deterred. “They’re not supporting the refugees here. We need a home, we need school, we need the good life. We are not animals.”

This is the French treating these migrants as less than human then, don't the French have an obligation to help these migrants? Why should we be given the guilt trip by Pierre when the French have set out 30 toilets for 3,000 people?

&gt;The refugees have been dehumanised by media outlets and politicians alike: the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, infamously described them as “marauding”; David Cameron referred to a “swarm of people”; the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, suggested sending in the army

The French have suggested we send in the army too, as much as Owen would like to attribute that suggestion to Farage for presumably violent reasons that's simply not the case, and the average policeman isn't equipped or trained to deal with something of this magnitude.

White wine to go with.

This has definitely helped Corbyn's campaign with an attitude of ""if we're going to lose, we may as well lose fighting for something we believe in"".

However, to me that attitude is completely without merit and really angers me. The Tories have a majority of just 12.  Getting 12 seats is an entirely realistic target. Yet the party seems more interested in fighting itself than fighting the Tories.  In doing so it is letting down precisely the people it claims to worry about the most.

In answering your question, I think the ""ABC"" candidates would prevent a Tory majority, but not be able to form a government.  Then another leader could hopefully build on that and get a comfortable majority in 2025.

I think Corbyn would get a similar number of votes to now (30%) - the party would gain votes from the left (Greens/SNP) but lose its more moderate voters to the right and Lib Dems.  The Tories would be back on 40%, with a 50+ majority.

The target for 2025 would then be to rebuild the party, but failing another leader like Tony Blair, I can't see the party getting the kind of swing it needs t get back into power that election.

You seem to have completely forgotten the 34% of the electorate that didn't vote at all. Whilst it's obviously not true that they would all vote for a Corbyn-led Labour, the people his is currently seeming to inspire - such as the young - are often in exactly the demographic that didn't vote due to feeling completely disengaged from politics.

You're also assuming that Corbyn couldn't attract any Lib Dem voters at all, and I'm pretty sure even from my circle of friends that this isn't true.

***I will not dismantle the tower. Please stop asking.***

This rig was built 3 months ago. It's worked flawlessly since then. It's taken everything I've thrown at it, and if I weren't leaving the country soon I'd be keeping it. So I've decided to sell it to you wonderful people!

***EDIT: QNIX is sold! Articulated VESA stand and the 1080p IPS Dell monitor are still available.***

ALSO INCLUDED with purchase of main rig:

* Microphone for video calls etc.
* Logitech Z323 speakers (2.1 - surprisingly great sound)
* Sundry additional cables, original boxes, screws and spare parts that came with the initial components.
* Fully articulated desk-mounted VESA monitor stand for dual monitors (as pictured, was a bitch to find and put together as the QNIX is so damn big)
* Original freestanding monitor mounts
* Original heatsink/cooler for Intel CPU

Price for everything above together: £850 plus postage. Postage will be recorded delivery and insured due to the value of the items, you'll get a receipt. Collection is preferred if you live in Edinburgh.

Q: Why the exorbitant, unreasonable, titanically huge price for a BRONZE certified PSU and a filthy casuel i5? 

A: These parts are cast-iron and I did my research before I bought them. The Seasonic PSU is bronze but it's a far better unit than a Corsair RM750, for example. Most parts in this build are at least a couple of notches above the basic grade. The RAM is colour co-ordinated with the mobo. This is a rig I built for fun and it's my baby. If I could, I'd ship it across the Atlantic, but I can't, so I'm selling it here.

Q: Has anything been overclocked?

A: Yes, but only for testing purposes. The GPU, CPU and 1440p monitor have all been successfully overclocked. The CPU overclocks to 4.2 with no trouble at all. The GPU overclocks decently, but honestly it could probably use some better thermal paste on the cooler if you want to push it heat-wise, so I've kept it at stock as I can't be arsed cracking open the casing. The monitor overclocks to 96Hz without complaining. They've all been kept at stock as I don't want to overstress the parts.

Q: Temps, bugbears? 

A: Temps are great. The Corsair cooler keeps everything chilly and there's tons of room for the mobo due to the case's design. No temperature-related issues at all. Sound from the integrated soundcard (thank you based ASUS) is fantastic, but takes a couple of seconds to 'wake up' if the rig has been sleeping. Storage is quiet and blazing fast - no complaints at all. The case collects a fair bit of dust (I've just cleaned it again) but it's roomy for an ITX so it's no problem to clean and maintain. The monitor stand takes a bit of getting used to (I've taken to angling the smaller second monitor to stream media while I work or game) but that's mostly an issue with the user rather than the hardware. The wireless receiver is an official one, but Windows occasionally has trouble recognising it, so you need to manually find the driver. This is a documented issue with the official Xbox receiver and Windows 8.1, and it's a 10-second fix. Otherwise the receiver works far better than I thought it would - great for having a friend game on the 2nd monitor in BL2.

Things I will do: sell the tower, keyboard and monitor separately, if needs be.

Things I will not do: pull parts out of the tower.

I don't mean this to be patronising, but it seems people who were never poor are just incapable of understanding what it's like to be poor.

To answer your question, the difference is that the prospect of debt, its interest payments, affect on ones ability to access credit and the fact that student loan repayments begin before one is actually ""in a comfortably middle class economic position"" discourage people from poorer backgrounds from entering higher education. 

Why is this a problem? It entrenches class divides, discourages meritocracy and there's the loss of all the other less obvious benefits of higher education e.g. greater tolerance towards people from different backgrounds etc. Ultimately our society would be better if the smartest of us were given every opportunity to succeed.

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"&gt; You seem to have completely forgotten the 34% of the electorate that didn't vote at all. Whilst it's obviously not true that they would all vote for a Corbyn-led Labour, the people his is currently seeming to inspire - such as the young - are often in exactly the demographic that didn't vote due to feeling completely disengaged from politics.

He didn't forget that at all. From his other ""comments"" post:

&gt;**Aren't non-voters more likely to vote Labour?**

&gt;I refer you again to the TUC post-mortem poll, which shows that non-voters are roughly the same in their political beliefs as voters. If we could win over exclusively those non-voters who are inclined to Labour, we might get somewhere, but unfortunately they mainly live in Labour safe-seats – for example, Tristram Hunt's safe Labour seat had the lowest turnout in the country in 2015 (IIRC – I can't find a list anywhere!), with just 49.9% of the elctorate turning out. If every one of those non-voters turned out, it obviously wouldn't affect the Tory majority one jot.

And from the main post:

&gt;The TUC poll is particularly interesting, as it also surveyed non-voters and found that they were pretty similar to the rest of the electorate in terms of their political opinions: The criticism of Labour as profligate and too soft on welfare and immigration showed up their with roughly the same frequency as it did everywhere else. Thus, the argument that we can win if non-voters come out to vote falls flat. This will only work if only Labour-inclined non-voters come out to vote, and even then, maybe not, given that non-voters tend to be concentrated in safe seats.",null,0,null,1439834666,null,null,false,0,cu63xms,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t1_cu63nke,null,null,null,1441305734,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

If a General strike was to be called from what quarters would it come? The NICRA? They had difficulty enough organising a march or Rally without being beaten off the streets, let alone grinding the state to a halt.

The Trade Union Movement? I've heard this line from the SP a few times; it is however completely delusional and ignores the situation in which the trade union movement found themselves in at the time. The complex reality was that the TU movement drew members across the board; the tendency to imagine that the TU movement stood distinct from ""orange and green"" is wishful thinking, it had a difficult enough time holding itself together let alone make a stand against the state with a General Strike.

Ironically reactionary elements within Loyalism used those tactics to take down the embryonic NI Assembly in [1973/1974](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/uwc/chr.htm). Loyalist Paramilitaries the UVF and UDA joined forces with Unionist politicians the soon to be leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, [Harry West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_West), [Bill Craig (UUP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Craig_%28politician%29) and Ian Paisley. The ""Strike"" brought NI to a stand still because there was an attempt at power sharing; the mere idea of sharing power with Nationalists brought about a General Strike and Sunngingdale was scrapped.

Which I'm sure you'll agree is at best and oversimplification.

&gt; the Western media love to get on Israel's back

That is debatable. Especially if you are implying they don't also ""get on"" Palestine/Hamas' back. 

&gt;but Hamas are the ones who fire rockets during peace times, and naturally Israel will defend its nations people. 

That is only looking at it from the Israeli perspective. For many Palestinians, especially in contested areas, have been under attack since close to the founding of Israel.  

Both sides feel they are acting in self defence and both sides can make a valid case for that. Which is why it is such a divisive issue and so tricky to work out a solution that treats both sides fairly. 

&gt;If Palestine wants peace, it first has to get rid of Hamas, the longer they exist, the more likely a two state solution will not occur.

If Israel wanted peace they should have stopped their agressive expansion years ago. Not to mention that even if we say Israel is always acting in self-defence they aren't acting in proportion, Israeli retribution and ""active defence"" has killed far more Palestinians than Hamas has killed Israelis. 

Do you honestly not see the huge bias in your answer? You are saying that Hamas should be the ones to sacrifice what they believe for the sake of peace. Why shouldn't it be Israel? 

Also you are ignoring the fact that many times Hamas might have been first to use violence during a peace agreement but they normally weren't the first to violate the terms of the peace agreement, making the peace void (i.e. expanding into Palestinian territory).

Anything is nickable, given the right tools, expertise and time. You can buy a sportscar and it can get nicked. You could buy a mountain of jewellery, lock it in a vault and it will get nicked. If its sought after and somebody knows it is there, it *can get nicked*.

*Will it get nicked* though - that's the question I think you're after.

Likely - no. 

When you park a car you lock the doors, wind up the windows and take the keys out of the ignition. Some people even park it in first gear and put a steering lock on it. Those are deterrents. Would you park the car with all the windows down and the keys in the ignition? No - because it makes the car a better target for those who are looking for a quick bit of fun at somebody elses (well earnt) expense. Devvo the chav is unlikely to want to try a car that is locked up tight - he'd much rather go to that old Citroen Saxo which he knows has a dodgy lock, which is parked 20m down the road not in view of the owners house because it will be quick, easy and unlikely to present any challenges He ain't gonna bother with your tightly locked car, in plain view of your front living room window. You're making it much less desirable to an opportunist like Devvo - he would rather go and find an easy pickings/low hanging fruit bike than try and get past all your preventative measures.

I saw a statistic not too long back - about 90% of house burglaries are not forced entry. That means that they pushed open an unlocked door, climbed through an open window... These people are opportunists, not professionals. 

But if a professional thief wanted that car? You've got no chance. He could do 101 things that you cannot possibly guard against. So to cut it down the middle - you do the best you can and guard against the majority of yobs who might want to take it.

And that's what we do. 9 out of 10 bike thefts will be a little toerag who learnt a few tricks down the park. It'll appear a few weeks later damaged beyond repair, in a ditch somewhere. We guard against that - which is remarkably easy to guard against, given the right mindset.

How often have parties even tried to go after the disengaged?

&gt;Also even with a high turnout, expecting more than 75% of people to vote seems far-fetched to me.

Why does it need to be 75%? Not all of the new votes need to come from non-voters - plus I suspect that Corbyn would be more likely to be happy with an alliance with the SNP or the Greens if that's what it took.

&gt;So even if there is a higher turnout it might be because people fear Corbyn's radical plans so much rather than everyone turning out the vote for him.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; what rankles is £500 Mn public money (that sounds like a joke but that's what it cost)

Nah, that's about right for a top-tier venue. The Emirates Stadium cost something like £480m.

&gt; If we're going to waste half a billion pounds on so ething, I'd rather the money were spent inspiring future generations. It could be converted for 3 mo the of the year to rolling sport's days for day trips to London from around the country.

That half-billion is already sunk. Running day trips or closing it out for 3 months of the year would not come from that pot of money (which went into building it) - it would come from some other pot of money. Which you haven't identified. But presumably if it's for school events, then it's going to come from the public purse. So you're saying that having spent a lot of public money on it, you want to spend a lot more public money on events in it.

So, we convert it for 3 months of the year - you mean the 3 months when major summer events like the World Athletics Championships and big stadium gigs would be held? That's all your summer income gone. The football season is August-May. So if you block it out for the second half of May, then June, July and the first half of August... that's your entire off-season gone! That's not inspirational - you could do that in any old football stadium if the woners would have you, and we've got a ton of football stadiums littering the country.

This is the point. If we accept that we wanted the Olympics (which we shall, because it's now a moot point!), then we needed a Park and a Stadium (which we now have), and that came at a cost.

The question now is how do we extract *best value* - bearing in mind that it will cost a further x-million per year to run it regardless of whether you have private tenants or not. Is the taxpayer expected to suck up the running costs in perpetuity, or are we going to commercialise it and generate an income so we don't have to spend any *more* on it?

Most sporting events are summer-based. Football is the exception. Let them have it through the winter - athletics, concerts and special events can have it through the summer. Football is even required to make way for other one-off events in-season (e.g. Rugby World Cup).

West Ham are coughing £2m/yr, which over the term of their 99-year lease is only £196m - so certainly not covering the costs on their own (however, though they are retaining ticketing income, they *are* sharing food and hospitality income, which will not be insignificant. They're not taking *all operating income* as they would if they owned the stadium).

The thing to remember is, they're not getting a stadium. They're a tenant. Lots of football clubs limit the concerts and other events at the behest of the groundsmen trying to care for the grass. But out of season, tough cookies - not their stadium. Heck, even in season it's not theirs. How many athletics events and concerts do they hold at Old Trafford? The answer is not very many. They might have a couple to help pay the bills, but it's a football stadium first.

This is *not* the case with the Olympic Stadium.

Consider the 2016/17 season - In West Ham's *very first year*, their August-May playing season is going to see their access curtailed from September through to the end of October for the Rugby World Cup. How many other Premiership Clubs have to share a stadium like that?

To say we've spent £500m on a stadium for West Ham is disingenuous at best - the Premiership involves 19 home games, and presumably a few more FA Cup games depending how far West Ham get through that. There will be *far more* non-football events in the stadium than that. They're just one tenant. The anchor tenant yes, but just one of many. There *are* school trips and tours, there *are* events aimed at inspiring the next generation - they're just not blocking out 3 months of the year for their sole usage!

You've got the build cost, but you've also got the running cost. You need enough private income to cover that, unless we want to fund it from the public purse.

And we're not actually *allowed* to fund it from the public purse, because that would infringe EU rules on subsidy and competition. Pubicly-funded events can *rent* the stadium on a *commercial basis*, but the government can't run a quasi-private/public thing going on where they let some events in for free and charge others.

Brunt isn't quick anymore but is quite strong, is tall, has good ball control, has one of the best left foots in the league, has decent positioning and never runs out of energy. Playing at Left Back protects him from his weaknesses, beating players and bursting past, and we are much more secure with him there than we are Poco, as much as I like Poco and want him to play.

Brunt and Dawson are better full backs than Zuiverloon, Shorey, Wisdom, Reid and any other full back we've had in the past 10 years. Only think that Billy Jones would get in over them. They aren't good enough for us moving forward, but Dawson can get better as he is only 25 and Brunt only has 2 years max before he takes a step backward, for mid table security, which we want, both are good enough for that. Lets not forget how good Dawson and Brunt were last season, Hazard still seems as though he's in Dawson's pocket. The issue I say is having two midfielders tuck in and not help out the full backs exposing them in a 2 on 1 which happened against QPR and Leicester.",null,0,null,1439836846,null,null,false,0,cu65duz,null,t3_3hbx5i,null,null,null,t1_cu646ah,null,null,null,1441306418,null,3,null,WBAfootball,t5_2tivu,3,null

Barbers are easily the worst customer service I've ever experienced. 

If you don't ask for a shaved head they look at you funny,

If you say you want the scissors and not the trimmers they freak out. Like fuck up im paying ye near a tenner for 10 mins work.

If you let them do their own thing, they'll fuck it up.

If you tell them what to do, they get all huffy.

can't they just do their job properly? Its why we outsource things, so people can specialize in them and do them best.

Clyne did good, but Skrtel and Lovren looked insanely insecure, and Stoke walked straight passed Gomez a lot of the time. Just bombed through our left side.

Even though Skrtel wasn't better than Lovren, he has been for the most part, by a mile. Thats why i'd sacrifice Lovren for Sakho, but better to leave him out of the squad apparently...Skrtel has proven quality at LFC, Lovren does not. 
Also, against Bournemouth, Moreno bombing up the wing wouldn't be that bad, especially if Gomez struggles like he did, since then we would have dropped Morenos offensive abilities, for someone with equal problems defensive.

Edit: additionaly, maybe Rodgers knows we are weak defensively, so starting with Can as the only protection infront of our defense is just asking for trouble this early in the season.

Lets be honest, you are not going to be around in 120 years to be paying that 20k lease, and even if you are, 20k in 120 years time will not be worth anything like the amount now.

If you still have the flat when the lease is around 90 years then you should be purchasing an extension to the lease back to 125 years.

City were the much, much better team in the first half, and hadn't it been for Begovic we would probably have been down 3 or 4 goals in the first half alone.


Second half though I think we played much better, we dominated the ball, half way through the 2nd half I believe we had 60-65% ball possession but we couldn't find the end product and create big enough chances since City were defending very well and we didn't have any stand out performances from any player unfortunately.

2. He didn't suck last year, he was inconsistent, there is a huge difference. Two goals and 7 assists in the league does not a 30 million pound player make, but it isn't dreadful. 

3. Offensive stats aside, there were many games I can think of (Liverpool @ anfield, Hull @ WHL, City @ WHL) where he lead the team in tackles and was one of our best players in terms of defending from the front. In a system like MPs which requires a high press, this is absolutely key.

Yes, it is being used for both. They have push-back seating covering the athletics track during football matches.

&gt; The judge said: “Paedophilia is not an issue in this case. You are not a sexual predator.” But a senior policeman ignored the ruling and told reporters outside the court that he still thought Langham was a paedophile.

If we're to believe his testimony (and the judge evidently did), he didn't access that stuff because of paedophilic tendencies or for sexual gratification, but for research. An ego-driven individual who willfully did wrong in pursuit of writing his script. An absolute offence in and of itself and absolutely not acceptable.

We are playing the same way we did a year ago and we have been found out. We need new ideas and Jose is the one who should come up with new attacking ideas. I blame Jose but the players also have to step up. Costa need to stop fighting. Fabregas is a world cup winner and a senior player and should take control of the game. Hazard does not look fit or intrested. Willian has been awful. Oscar has been the only good player and he is injured.

That's the point, **they won't be able to**. 

Didn't you read what I wrote about the legal changes the Conservatives are bringing in?

At the moment all union members pay a £1 political levy and if you don't want it to go to the Labour party you must actually opt out (and then your pound will go to a designated charity).

The law is changing so that you have to *opt-in* to pay a levy to the Labour party. How many union members are committed enough to opt in? About the same as have signed up to vote in the Labour leadership election - 189,000.

So we'll go from getting £2 million a year to about £189,000 a year. And the leadership of the unions won't be able to do a thing about this.

To change the law we need to get back to government. *Corbyn won't get us back into government*. In the interim before 2020 we need corporate sponsors - but *Corbyn won't get any*, whereas Yvette will.

Basically if Corbyn wins the Labour movement is screwed - we might not even have enough to fight the next election.",null,0,null,1439840688,null,null,false,0,cu67yri,null,t3_3hbg8f,null,null,null,t1_cu6352q,null,null,null,1441307634,null,0,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

Mignolet - 5/10.  Poor on the one chance they had, and was quite lucky it was ruled off.  I think he could've done better on that.  Otherwise hasn't had much to do, thankfully, and has looked fine in distribution.

Gomez - 6/10. Invisible in a good way.  They haven't been attacking down his wing at all, he's been assured in possession.

Lovren - 6/10.  Started out very nervous, including the disallowed goal that was clearly his fault, but settled well and got a nice stop when Lallana hesitated outside our box.

Skrtel - 4.5/10.  Very poor, with a number of sloppy, avoidable errors.  He needs to clean his game up soon or we're going to concede off one of his mistakes.

Clyne - 7/10.  Been very solid in defense and contributed very well going forward.  A game and a half into the season and he looks like a quality signing.

Milner - 7/10.  Been very solid contributing to the attack and going forward, one of our better players on the pitch.

Henderson - 6.5/10.  He's been fine keeping the ball ticking and was well involved on the two creative set pieces.  Could've had a goal off that crazy half volley.

Ibe - 5.5/10.  I wasn't particularly impressed with his decision making last week; this week his touch has looked poor too.  Needs to do better than this to retain his starting spot, and it's even more pressing with Firmino coming back in the side soon.

Lallana - 5/10.  Invisible.  Needs to make better runs and be better off the ball to involve himself in the attack with these next two guys.

Coutinho - 7.5/10.  Had a few sloppy passes earlier on, but has (per usual) been involved in every attack since then.  He and Benteke seem to have a nice understanding, too - I hope the two of them continue being this productive into the future.

Benteke - 7.5/10.  Been involved in every attack as well, winning great headers.  Did well to get his goal too (although it should've been offsides due to Coutinho's move).  Very impressed with him.

Anfield support - 0/10.  This is embarrassing for a home opener.  It sounds like a graveyard there.

-Skrtel and Lovren looked very shaky. Lovren got a bit lucky to be given that foul on the corner.

-Coutinho and Benteke look like their chemistry is starting to develop well.

-Clyne's been great down the right side both in defense and attack. That tackle on Gradel especially was a beauty. 

-I'm a bit surprised Bournemouth haven't tried to test Gomez more though he has been solid. 

-Benteke has made some very well-timed runs and he's done quite well in the air.

-I still feel like the team looked better with Can playing the holding role when they switched to a 4-3-3. The 4-2-3-1 is working against Bournemouth but will work against the top 4?

Clyne is love. Clyne is life. 

Having Ibe on the left gives us attacking options on both wings.

Milner drifts onto the right wing to provide width with Clyne.

This leaves the midfield very exposed at times. We may get away with it against Bournemouth but will definitely have to adapt to stronger teams.

It's not an excuse for anything, its a reality of what our club is trying to achieve right now. Stop thinking about the next five months and think about the next five years mate. The single striker narrative is so ridiculous. its not like we are playing 3 games a week. Its not like having soldado as backup was doing anything anyway. We wouldve signed a striker already if it was worth it. We are probably waiting on other clubs to finally bring in the players we want and put in the manhours analyzing. 

&gt; and playing kids in midfield?

These ""kids"", who are in midfield led us to a cup final and 5th place last season. They are also improving as they get more experience. Mason has been great and Dier has done more than a competent job in midfield. 

Let poch, mitchell, and levy do their thing. The amount of man hours put in to facilitate one transfer in and out is immense. Have faith in the club, manager, and infrastructure.

Point A is further invalidated by the fact that we're not in Germany ^^[*citation* ^^*needed*] . What is viewed as extreme there may not be seen as similarly extreme here.

You then propose an entirely false dichotomy, which is, frankly, wrong on virtually every level, and facile on the levels where it is not wrong. There are four candidates, not two, and the paths they may actually take are still more diverse. The idea of a 'mainstream media narrative' is simplistic, as is that of 'corporate power' -- both of which are also conveniently nebulous entities (so that Owen Jones, for example, could rail against both while writing for, um, a mainstream publication owned by a corporation).

You likewise set out a conveniently vague notion of values and the totally random assertion that all MPs saying whatever they want ('speaking with conviction') will somehow lead to the electorate backing them, rather than becoming deeply confused about what the party wants.

I have set out, at great length, why a straight 'win' for any candidate in 2020 is unlikely. Your vague invoking of 'the public' is not really very well backed up (they're against spin and scheming... So they elected arch spinners and schemers in the form of Osbourne and Cameron?). The Green surge is nonexistent and the Ukip surge, while very real, has led to them winning one parliamentary seat. The conditions that led to the rise of the SNP do not exist in any form for Labour ('auterity' really doesn't cut it), so the comparisons there are spurious. Additionally, far from being radically different, the SNP merely presented themselves as radical while nicking our ideas and imposing rigid message discipline of the kind that, you suggest above, prevents parties from winning elections.",null,0,null,1439842213,null,null,1439909335,0,cu68ztp,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t1_cu62pmb,null,null,null,1441308118,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

I agree with you that fans of Bundesliga clubs quite often support other Bundesliga clubs in European competitions, even Bayern gets some support even though many people hate them in the Bundesliga

But I think I'd word that a bit differently. Germans are generally not really nationalistic due to historic reasons of course, I'd wager you'd find fewer people in Germany who'd say they are proud of their nation than in many other countries

I think it has more to do with the fact that it wasn't that long ago that the Bundesliga had only 3 possible CL spots, only being the 4th or 5th best league in UEFA rankings. And quite a few of people want to see the Bundesliga doing well in relation to other leagues, as that at least reflects a bit on clubs in the Bundesliga as a whole (although only the top teams compete in Europe).

Seriously that paper is extremely bias and plays loose with the facts. It is essentially a list of questions that only has relevance if you assume being anti-Israel or not pro-Israel = anti-semitic. 

Let's see the other sides of this questions shall we (edit coming):

1 and 2 - We should know what Corbyn has donated to. I havn't heard of the DYR being an anti-semitic group it may well be though. However Corbyn could easily have donated to the group because it seems on the surface to be a group dedicated to remembering a massacre of innocent people by Zionist militants. However much some people want it to be a thing though 'guilt by association' is just silly. It is like saying that because Hitler was a vegetarian all vegetarians are nazis. Corbyn could either have made a mistake or believe in remembering Deir Yassin but not believe in the personal beliefs of other people who support the same group.

3 - Why Charlie Hebdo is just harmless satire that needs to be protected and is part of the European tradition, etc. But then when someone draws the same type of cartoon about Jewish people (infact less offensive in some cases) it is racist and anti-semitic? I'm sure the JC was neutral on this issue? Oh no wait

http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/128889/bbc-avoids-calling-charlie-hebdo-killers-terrorists

http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/127847/after-charlie-hebdo-attack-what-else-can-we-expect

http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/130508/27-cent-uk-muslims-sympathise-motives-charlie-hebdo-killers-poll-reveals

http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/127821/charlie-hebdo-attackers-shouted-prophet-has-been-avenged%E2%80%99

So that gives you an idea of the agenda of the JC, which honestly seems a lot more opinionated on issues of RELIGION than Corbyn (who is concerned with matters of DIPLOMACY BETWEEN TWO STATES). 

4 -  Ok I admit this one has got me a bit. Sizer is a nut job. I can see possibly defending him on free speech but I would have to disagree with Corbyn if he is defending Sizer ideas. However I can't actually find a full transcript of his thoughts on the issue just almost-to-convenient soundbites. So I would reserve judgement but admit this one is very dodgy. All that being said it is worth noting that the one undebatably anti-semitic comment Sizer made he claimed was to start a discussion on censorship. Even ignoring all the Jewish stuff though, he is a nut job anyway. 

5 - There is absolutely nothing wrong with associating with either group. Sharing some of their beliefs or supporting their policies then yes. The 'friends' thing is from one instant where he was introducing a group of people, it is a common way to introduce people at a formal event and, as you said, is also conciliatory. 

6 - Unless I'm missing something there are none/one or two anti-semitic signs. The rest are anti-Israel which is not anti-semitic no matter how much certain groups bleat that it is. It is like saying condemning something the US does is anti-Christian (we all know what the people who actually make that type of claim are like...)

7 -   He was never convicted for blood libel and even himself said that he doesn't believe in the whole blood libel thing. That being said Raed Salah is a pretty complex individual and I'd have to write another post of at least the same length to even come close to discussing him fully. So out of laziness as it is getting late here is a wiki link and you can make up your own mind 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah

Likewise, wiseup said that they were honoured throughout the world - which in my comment there shows they were indeed honoured by at least tens of thousands throughout the world.

null,null,2b-_-not2b,null,null,null,"I have realised that once Mourinho builds a strong team he is unable to make meaningful upgrades to the team or at least that is his challenge at Chelsea in second term. For the past 12-15 years once his team reaches a certain potential and wins he either leaves ends up leaving the team (Porto &amp; Inter) or starts faltering and leaves due to other teams strengthening and figuring out Mourinho's play (Chelsea (2004-06) &amp; RM).

For his long stay and building a legacy I believe this (being a title contender season after season) is a new challenge for him and will define him to be the greatest manager of modern era.

On that note, we see that his first season here he played with whatever team he had and identified weakness and areas for strengthening where he made and won the title next season. However in the second half of the last season we see that he had sold or loaned out all the surpluses by Jan and had a thread bare squad which was the strongest starting 11 but lacking in bench strength. It was around this time we started playing defensively and teams started figuring out our weaknesses on the right side. So this season it seems that so far that is still the case (Jose hasn't seemed to address these weakness for reasons unknown)

Now we know that there is a genuine weakness on the right side and our attacking threat from right is practically 0. Willian did a great job covering ground on that side last time.

I think we could've done better with Mikel alongside Matic yesterday. Just an opinion, it's a 50-50. Might have been worse.

But yeah, Hazard needs to wake up and score goals from open play more often. Diego Costa needs to actually stay up on his feet and play for some time. And how badly we need Oscar. We've got no cover for him, or anyone for that matter.

Give me distance covered statistics instead of just inane rambling about perceived work rate. This is the same type of lazy journalism that claims that Ozil or Pirlo are lazy, when they were consistently covering the 2nd or 3rd most ground on their teams. This accusation coming from the same set of fans that circlejerk about Willian's work rate despite his obvious lack of final product. Cesc creates goals, yet this false perception of him not running is completely baseless. We can't expect him to do everyone's job. Midfield is not synonymous with play every position at once. Yet he still tries to put in a good defensive shift. Even in the game against City, I counted at least twice where he came back and made great tackles to cover for Ivanovic, who was getting toasted for the n'th time. Hazard is being marked out of games, Oscar is injured and Ramires hasn't been worth anything in an attacking sense for about 2 or 3 years now. We have no outlet pass, no one making runs in behind, everyone seems to want to come short to the ball and play this bullshit ping it around the edge of the box like Arsenal do and it's tedious to watch. You know what would help Cesc more than him doing more running? A right winger who makes runs to alleviate the pressure that both Hazard and Cesc are now receiving and subsequently being neutralized by. Cesc is at his best when he can play deeper, have that half second longer to pick his head up and pick a long pass. Instead he's having to play further forward, trying to play the game at the same pace and is immediately harried off the ball leading to opposing team counterattacks. We need a midfield three to truly compliment the core of players that we have. Defense changes need to be made as well, but the core of the issue is ball retention and transition from the middle third to the final third, where we are not creating any space due to lack of willing and COMPETENT winger and fullback overlapping runs.",null,0,null,1439842905,null,null,false,0,cu69gf7,null,t3_3hcpue,null,null,null,t3_3hcpue,null,null,null,1441308335,null,32,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,32,null

On the other hand, if there is nothing in writing to say this, even if everyone ""knows"" that this is how they've calculated your current wage, then they are basically just not offering you the pay rise you were expecting, in which case I don't think there's much you can do about it legally.

It looked to me more like a 3-man midfield a lot of the time and Fabregas was near the box a lot. Maybe in my drunken haze I am completely misremembering the positioning and if so I apologize for the comment, but Mourinho setting up conservatively in big matches is hardly a new thing. I remember seeing Hazard and Willian outside the majority of the time.

What I meant in my initial comment re: playing conservatively was in regard to including Ramires at all when we could've used Cuadrado, Moses, Remy, etc. and tried to take the game to City a bit more. Yes, I know that would've left our CMs exposed defensively with Fabregas having to play there, but we got opened up defensively anyway and posed little to no attacking threat outside of like two legitimate chances (one that Hazard should've hit first time and scored on).",null,0,null,1439843686,null,null,1439843880,0,cu69zbv,null,t3_3hb09v,null,null,null,t1_cu65yi5,null,null,null,1441308648,null,1,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

Who else do we have that has similar vision and creativity with that spark to make things happen? Arguably only Prich and Lamela right now. Pritchard may be the answer, I do have lots of faith in him, but he's totally unproven at EPL level and it's a gamble throwing him in at the deep end. 

Lamela I think is much more suited to AMC than on the wing, was better there at River (see him vs Boca and Riquelme at AMC) and was actually shifted out to the right because of Totti. I think he'd excel there over on the wing. But judging from the opening games he's off the pace a bit and right now I'd rather have Eriksen in the side over any alternatives, including buying a replacement so late on. 

This is the kinda move that would make sense if we had a full season trying Lamela and Prich at AMC, seen they're capable, and the bid over is over 35m.

&gt;Require all unions, not just those affiliated to Labour, to ask each existing union member whether they wish to pay the political levy and then repeat the question every five years. The £25m annual political fund income from 4.5 million political levy payers funds a wide range of political campaigning including being a chief source of funding for Labour.

The entire political fund is at threat. So the Unions *won't* have anything spare in the fund to hand over unless members specifically opt in. The extra money you mentioned a few posts up came from this fund and was raised under the old rules.

The aim is not only to attack Labour funding, but other campaigning the union does, that costs money.

And we won't be able to reverse this law unless we get into govt and we won't get into govt with Corbyn.

Neither can truly play the CAM role like Oscar. Obviously Ramires on the wing was supposed to give Ivanovic cover, but it also meant there was no one who was ever going to challenge Kolarov. And Hazard playing out of position meant Sagna was going to have an easy day. In my opinion if Oscar is injured, we need another player to fill that Oscar CAM role to make sure that Hazard/Willian can stay wide, rather than force them to go central. 

Cuadrado actually did something Hazard/Willian/Ramires didn't do at all during the match but should've. Towards the end, he came from the wing position, cut inside, and took a left footed shot. It was straight to Hart, but it at least challenged him. That kind of wing play was missing all match.

In my opinion a smarter move would have been Fabregas at CAM, RFL/Mikel at CDM. Not his best position, but at least Hazard/Willian could play wide, and Fabregas' defensive deficiencies would be less glaring.  

In my opinion, tactical failure from Mou.

Well that won't happen. The US system isn't one of promotion and relegation. The only way MLS comes to South Florida/Miami is via League expansion. For a good while now David Beckham has actually been the face of a group trying to get a football specific stadium built so that we can get a team. But we're still waiting to see how that pans out.

That's another fun difference with American sports Leagues that would make promotion relegation system impractical.

If the scenarios were the same but the systems were reversed, and American sensibilities ruled the EPL, the Bournemouth stadium would be deemed unacceptable as a venue. A team owner would likely be told that unless you have a minimum capacity of *'n'* you cannot be a part of our top tier league.

Hi There,

Following a long RMA request for a faulty Powercolor R290 PCS+ I have been sent a brand new Asus ROG Matrix Platinum Radeon 290X card as a replacement from an online retailer (I suspect they couldn't get anything from Powercolor).

As I have since bought a Sapphire Fury OC I have no need for this one anymore and I'm looking to sell it.

I'm looking for £200, shipping included, or £190 if someone is keen to do the transaction ""face to face"" in London.

null,null,TomShoe,1972crest,,null,"Perhaps pompous is the wrong word, but there's a definite pride in German football that seems unique to me compared to other countries. it could just be that more of the fans of german clubs on /r/soccer are actually german than the fans of English and Spanish clubs, but I've noticed the same thing in real life as well. 

I rarely see German fans on /r/soccer accept criticism of the Bundesliga, to the point where supporters of teams like Wolfsburg and BVB will actually defend the league from criticism concerning Bayern's dominance despite their clubs directly being hurt by it. You frequently see such criticism coming from German fans, mind, but as soon as a fan from another club offers the same criticism, they're given a hundred different reasons why they're wrong. 

I've also noticed a certain pride of the relative lack of money in the BuLi, and I've seen German supporters lord it over English, and to a degree Spanish, fans as though it's some moral victory.

In arguments about the competitiveness of teams from different countries in the CL, I've seen fans defend the performances of rival clubs in order to make the point that German clubs outside Bayern are competitive in Europe. 

I think everyone here who's been on /r/soccer recently will also be familiar with the insistence, mostly from bayern fans, but from fans of other german clubs as well, that a player like de Bruyne would never in a million years choose to come to City. 

It just seems that they tend to be uniquely prideful of their nations football, and while you see it to a degree from other fans - the Premier League is not necessarily the best league guys - somehow it seems more ardent among German supporters.

null,null,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"From watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG3tLDLsm3U) of his 32 goals last season I was pretty impressed.. ha ha, although watching highlights of someone only scoring goals it's generally easy to be! What I found most impressive is that his finishes seemed almost 50/50 split between right and left foot, which I think is really amazing thing to have in your locker as a striker.  You never have to worry about a weaker foot.. if the ball's there to be hit then you hit it without hesitation. Not to mention his rating on whoscored was great last season (albeit he was playing in a lower league... but so was Gestede and everyone seems perfectly happy to have picked him up). 

I'm sure he'd work great off Gestede (I think any forward would to be honest, it's always easier when you've got someone to flick it on for you and keep the centre backs occupied with their physical presence.. especially if you've got pace to run off them). 

What I'd really like to know is how his hold up/back to goal play is as I'd like us to have another option to play up front as a lone striker (as it looks like Sherwood doesn't fancy Kozak and I can't imagine Gabby or Ayew playing the role effectively).  He looks quite strong and has a nice touch so I wouldn't be surprised if he'd be up to it, but who knows, some players with the attributes to do it still feel uncomfortable in that role (e.g. Lukaku).  

All in all, I'd be really happy to buy him for anything less than.. lets say.. £8m. ",null,0,null,1439844609,null,null,false,0,cu6alu2,null,t3_3hbm9m,null,null,null,t1_cu69pz5,null,null,null,1441308943,null,7,null,avfc,t5_2s569,7,null

Voting Ed was supposed to be a break from that past, the unions were all over him. In reality I think it's only fair to say New Labour has lost one election and that's coming out of a global financial crisis which caused problems for incumbent governments everywhere at the next election. I'm not saying that Ed was truly left wing, but the party definitely shifted further away from the centre under his leadership. 

At this point in time the party is sort of eating itself and I am really starting to doubt it has a chance whoever ends up in charge, Liz Kendall or Corbyn. Too many divisions. But it can start building a platform for later elections and Corbyn is not the direction you want to be heading in when the electorate just rejected your moderately left platform for a conservative one. 

But then again, you talk about mitigating the Tories like they're a great evil when they're running the most centre leaning conservative government I can recall learning of. Tory-lite only becomes a fair criticism when you've conceded that the centre ground is uniquely conservative, it's unfortunate if Labour have done that.

- Benteke looks fantastic, he's much needed in Liverpool's offense.
- Clyne is very solid, seems like a very good buy. 
- Moreno had a good cameo. 
- 3 points!
- Extremely fortunate to have Bournemouth's first goal waved off. 

Cons:

- Barely scraped a win vs a not very great side. Benteke's goal should've probably been disallowed. 
- Midfield got completely overrun, especially after Hendo was taken off.  
- Lallana is looking more and more like he's not worth the transfer fee.
- Coutihno was very wasteful today, should've scored at least 1-2 goals. 
- The Lovren and Skrtel partnership looks like it's an accident waiting to happen.

I thought Moreno really shone when he came on, and Can did well to replace Hendo. Milner consistent as always.

Man of the match for me was definitely Clyne, he was very solid in dealing with the pace of Bournemouth out wide making Skrtel's job easier. Lovren did alright after his shaky first 5 minutes. Coutinho was good until he was tired in around the 65th minute (if he wasn't fatigued he probably would have scored a few of those wayward shots).

Did he?

&gt; [Speaking to Evan Davis on BBC ""Newsnight,"" the long-serving MP for Islington North backpedalled slightly, asserting that “only in some cases” was the Ukip vote driven by bigotry, accepting that others balloted for Nigel Farage’s party “believing it was anti-establishment.”](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/08/jeremy-corbyn-bbc-newsnight-ukip-voters-motivated-by-racism_n_7539938.html)

Some vote for UKIP because of them being anti-establishment, some vote for them because they're racist or xenophobic, and some people vote for them for other reasons. Saying some people who vote for UKIP do so for racist reasons isn't saying all UKIP voters are racist. 

As somebody else said, UKIP ran on a platform of 'immigration will help the working class', and less on a platform of right-libertarian economics. If Corbyn can successfully argue that, in fact, all the problems facing the working class don't all 100% stem from immigration, he can definitely make inroads with the working class people who voted UKIP.

null,null,TehEwok,english,Kent,null,"I've lived in Maidstone for around 15 years, so In response to your questions, I'll ask one - What on earth have you done?

I'll tell you what you've done - found one of the few towns in the UK with less culture than a pot of Muller Rice. I'll answer your questions, but you won't like the truth.

1. Inbred or half-vegetable might be a little harsh - but you're not too far off. You have to think of this town as existing on it's own little void - where there is very little to be proud of and not much to do but drink and visit the carriage museum (I've been there three times, once was a guided tour. I don't even like horses)

2. Good shops? We've got every shop! Even an Apple store (which for some reason has named itself 'STORMFRONT' and erected a large sign with the same name as a Neo-Nazi community). The problem is, every shop is factory-printed and sell the same shit you'd find in any other middle England town. 

3. Decent Pubs? Try the WetherSpoons near the station. Don't like it? Walk down the road and try the Wether Spoons near the town square. Don't like it? Walk across the road and try the Brenchley - it's run by Wetherspoons. If you want a traditional pub, either leave the town centre, or as other people have mentioned, go to 'Ye Olde Thirsty Pig' - it is a strange small pub full of metal-heads. The barmaid has track-marks, the barman reminds me of the movie 'SlingBlade' and I'm sure they water down the Whiskey. Ale is OK though. Also - duck as you go in, the amateurs are obvious by the sound of them smacking their head on the beam.

4. The park by the church is a drug-dealing death patch after around 5.30 - I'll admit it's quite nice in the day time, as long as the skag addicts aren't still sleeping it off. Avoid ""Brewer Street"" opposite this park, it has at least three crack-houses. Mote Park is slightly nicer as people have mentioned, but it's not perfect. People set themselves on fire there quite often (You'll understand in a few months why..) and there have been a spate of knife-point robberies this month.

5. Local Hints.. Sure:

* If you get lost in town, ask the homeless man who lives outside Marks and Spencer for directions, you can't miss him, he has a face tattoo and a pet Ferret.

* If you're walking through town after 11pm on a Weekend, expect to be heckled, spat at, punched or from experience, literally picked up and carried off.

* Don't give the ""blind"" accordion busker outside of Poundland any change.. I was watching him once and he checked his watch.

* Avoid the river. Another crime hotspot - plus people keep falling in and drowning whilst pissed.

* NEVER visit Park Wood Estate, it is renown for once having the highest pregnancy rate in Europe. A quick afternoon stroll and you'll become a Dad whether you want to or not. 

* Prostitutes work in flats next to cinema - pop over, they're friendly. Drug-dealers live in Tovil - pop over, they'll literally fire BB guns at you.

* Milner - how did we get him on a free? 

* Moreno - wonderful 10 minute cameo and he needs to start

***Negatives*** 

* Lallana - Firmino though still unproven needs to start ahead of him - very little impact on the last two matches, disappointing as I was hoping for him to start brightly this season 

* Ibe - still ends up stifling our movement with dead-end runs down the flank

* Skrtel &amp; Lovren have such a touch-and-go chemistry - not convincing at the back

* Atmosphere -come on Anfield

Moreno was a complete breath of fresh air when he came on.    He looked solid at the back, and was very dangerous moving forward.   He should start in the game vs. Arsenal.

Coutinho was dreadful in front of goal.     His first touch around the box wasn't on point, which is unusual for him.

A couple things for me, we need a centre half that is comfortable bringing the ball forward. The amount of times where they'd let the centre halves have the ball, but cover the pass was infuriating. All they had to do was just bring it forward and make the man come to them then the pass will open up. 

We cannot handle when teams press us. Seriously... every fucking time someone presses we either pass it sideways or lose the ball. We need more players that can take on the man that's pressing them, because generally if you can get past that initial press then things will really open up.

Conversely, for all the energy we put towards pressing, it is so god damn easy to pass it around our players. Our energy is great, but we do not intercept the ball in dangerous positions enough, and it had been pretty easy for Stoke and Bournemouth to get past our press.",null,1,null,1439845357,null,null,1439846058,0,cu6b451,null,t3_3hd0bv,null,null,null,t1_cu6aqre,null,null,null,1441309182,null,7,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

2. Clyne looks very solid and Gomez looked good except for some shaky moments in the air. We had some trouble with Bournemouth's runners, but that seemed to be more of a problem with our midfield than our back four.

3. Can was quite disappointing when he came on, lacking the mobility to cope with Bournemouth's dynamism (something which i think Lucas would struggle equally). Unless Henderson was tired or injured, subbing Hendo off weakened our team despite Hendo having a poor game by his standards.

Overall our defence seems solid enough but our attack is lacking. Gomez and Clyne are solid defensively, but don't really give us much of a threat going forward, so we seem to be relying on our front four + midfield runners.

I don't know about you, but I don't really see it as strange of not being a fan of the league your favorite club plays in being badmouthed constantly in such a way. And I actually see fans of other leagues get into similar arguments as well, even fans of the PL get in quiet a few arguments about how much quality there is in the lower half of the table compared to other leagues, mostly when arguing with Spanish fans about the supposed lack of quality in the bottom half of La Liga

And Bayern's domiance isn't really all that different from top clubs in other leagues, Manchester United under Ferguson was more dominant in the PL than Bayern in the last 25 years or so, at least if you just look at where they finished in the league. Juve now won the 4th league title in a row, something Bayern has never achieved.

I'll bite then. 

At no point did i say we should exile people, what i was implying was that in England or the UK we have certain things that the majority of the nation want. Whether this be mixed gendered classes or not seating people at different points on a bus based on skin colour.

Now you're free to disagree with how this country is run, its called an election, and im sure somewhere you might find a party that does indeed want to segregate people based on whatever attribute they deem fit and when we have an election feel free to vote for them. 

They will then enact certain laws or do certain things that they said they would and the majority that voted for them is happy.

Unfortunately in the UK we have a government that did away with this type of segregation quite a while ago and seems to be generally appreciated by the populace although it hasn't even been a talking point in about 50 years.

If you disagree very very strongly with certain things the government (or previous governments) do or have done then its very likely there is a government out there that you can agree with.

In the case of gender segregation there are indeed countries like this such as Saudi Arabia. You're more than welcome to emigrate or apply for asylum there, whichever you fancy really.

Lallana was appauling throughout the first half (though he improved dramatically in the second), and should've been taken out, constantly slowing down the flow. The subs came in too late and we barely scraped by a fucking newly promoted team, this was not a good performance. Sure, it's the second game of the season but there was ZERO improvement over last week.

The Firmino sub should have came in sooner and potentially not for Ibe. Ibe was doing well down the side and was spreading our play. The second Hendo/Ibe were out (albeit Hendo was injured) we started suffering massively and could hardly string a pass together because we were too central. They piled on the pressure and we sat back and tried to soak up, which we just about handled. Against a better team, we'd more or likely have conceded. Remember who we were playing.

Ings could easily have played the central role behind Benteke, allowing Firmino to position out on the wing.

Willian only needs to work on his effect on the final third of the game. Find your man with a cross, shoot on target, influence play, make runs into the box. But all he does is his B side of the task, tracking back. Which is just as important to our game as anything else. But if we're not going to score at all or try to score off those poor scraps he feeds our forwards. We're in for hell. 

I think Fabregas really needs to play where he seems to influence play the most, deep in midfield. Not a whole lot of running, kind of like Pirlo if I'm not mistaken. Because at this point it's Matic in the pivot doing both jobs. So either Oscar plays along side the duo or we'd have to find a new alternative because Fabregas has been like this since January and it's upsetting. Dunno what Mikel would have brought to the game but he would have at least not taking away from it like Ramires. 

Costa needs to stop being a baby and play football not win the penalty. I wonder what's up with Azzah though. He's too good a player to have such a dip in form. Maybe it's the responsibilities or being the one man army he's usually playing as thanks to everyone playing without a heart.

Play Asmir one more game, he's definitely got a lot in him.

null,null,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"This is rewriting history a bit to suggest Miliband was 'New Labour'. He was clearly a break from New Labour with that wing of the party represented by David Miliband. David was the Progress candidate. Miliband was seen as a break from it and won on the back of the Union vote. 

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/ed-miliband-wins-labour-leadership

&gt; Most of the younger Miliband's campaign message had been directed towards those on the left of the party, **declaring New Labour to be ""dead""** and attacking the drift to what he described as ""brutish US-style capitalism"".
&gt; 
&gt; By contrast David Miliband, who for years had been seen as a natural successor to Tony Blair, stuck resolutely to a position more on the centre ground, refusing to abandon the New Labour approach of appealing both to middle class and core Labour voters.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/8033024/Ed-Miliband-pledges-to-put-Labour-back-on-path-to-socialism.html

&gt; In an interview on Wednesday, the new Labour leader said that he wanted to take the party on the path back to his form of socialism.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown rarely referred to “socialism” amid fears it would alienate voters who were fearful of the Left-wing Labour agenda in the 1980s.

Ed Miliband was the left-wing candidate in 2010 and he explicitly sought to break from New Labour. He was much more open on replacing trident and he wasn't scared of the world socialism. 

Now he has lost the election he has been disowned by those who supported him. The more left wing Labour members need to portray the defeat in May as a defeat for the centrists in the party and not the left-wingers. It's the only way they can justify a response that involves going *further* left. 

After all the conventional reading of the election, where over 50% of the electorate voted for a right-of-Labour party, would indicate that Labour alienated a lot of centre-ground voters. For example Labour made the mistake of assuming Liberal Democrat voters were just errant Socialists waiting to come back home. This was wrong. 

So it's disingenuous to imply that Ed Miliband was New Labour and that this was the second time it's failed. The left-wing of the party had it's chance in 2010 and it blew it but now wants a another go. 

And if Corbyn wins next month but loses in 5 years then the cycle will continue. Corbyn wasn't radical enough, he wasn't left-wing enough and he wasn't a good enough candidate to win in 2020. Instead what will be needed is a real left-winger who can really advocate left-wing ideals. One thing is for sure, the left never loses. It either neither competed or the voters were hoodwinked by the right-wing media. Never must it be questioned that maybe Britain just doesn't go for it.

Mignolet 7 dealt with everything well though we limited them in terms of real chances. Handled most crosses well. 

Clyne 9: a wall. Nothing got past him, strength, pace, power, consistent passing, got forward and linked play. A revelation in the back 4. MOTM 

Lovren 6.5: started very shaky but grew into the game in the end. Cannot start like that vs Arsenal. We all want Sakho and I'm honestly not sure what Rogers is thinking atm. At least he's getting better. 

Skrtel 7: a few hairy moments and has to stop manhandling people in the box but generally dealt well with everything tonight.

Gomez 7: solid and showed some good touches and passes but does not offer much going forward yet. Will take solid all day. 

Milner 7: covered every blade of grass and shielded the back 4 very well. Passed the ball nicely. 

Henderson 7: copy and paste plus the assist. Hope his injury isn't bad. 

Coutinho 7: should have had a goal but after last week we can forgive him. Lovely touches throughout still gelling with Big Christian but signs of things coming together. 

Lallana 4.5: poor today in his attacking role. Rarely created anything seemed to dwell on the ball way to much, over dribbling and slowing the play a lot. Probably needs to drop to the bench for the next game. Did some good work defensively in the last third of the game. 

Ibe 6: started brightly but faded would have liked to have seen him switch wings through the game. But he's young and he's a real threat with plenty of potential. 

Benteke 8: great time to score! Worked tirelessly, chased, battled and generally looked every bit a £30 million game changer. Very impressed and if he continues this way he'll be a success here. 

Can 6.5: worked hard and fitted in seamlessly when he came on. Some very mature clever play to help see the game out. Should start vs Arsenal

Firmino 5: didn't really get into the game but worked hard. His time will come. 

Moreno 7: worked very hard when he came on made a lovely run and gave Gomez some protection in the final minutes. Nice to see he isn't sulking. 

Brendan 7.5: don't know why he left lallana on so long or what on earth Sakho has done to him but he seems to have found a way to keep us defensively solid which is more than we've been in the last 3 seasons. 

Anyway 6 from 6 IT'S OUR YEAR LADS!!!!

I'd even say La Liga has been more interesting over that same period, and Certainly La Liga has established itself as the most competitive league on the European Stage. There's a lot to be said for the BuLi. The clubs really respect their fans, the youth development is very good, and the atmosphere is great at a lot of clubs. But Bayern's dominance of the league, and the poor showing of other teams in Europe are both very valid criticisms that German fans rarely seem to accept from foreigners.

Some people have no issue seeing their NHS dentists, others seem to have little luck in finding any to take them on. The issue isn't there are no dentists at all, it's generally finding a dentist that will take on *new* NHS patients. Those same dentists may happily see you as a private patient, though, so in that sense you likely won't find it too difficult to find a private one. The only issue is that it is, of course, really expensive because it is private care after all. As for rates and stuff, I honestly don't know.

I think your best bet is to scout around the internet to find dentistry practices in the area you will be staying in, and contact local dentists (eg, find them through Google, etc) and see if they're willing to take on new NHS patients and if not what their rates are for private care. You really will need to make it specific to the area to find any useful information.

How long are you staying for?

Thoughts:
A good win. Bournemouth were well up for it and played well. Coutinho is getting fitter and fitter. The two fullbacks look like two fantastic signings, with Joe Gomez being a real steal (just a shame he's not left footed). Benteke will get better and better as his relationship on the pitch with the AMs gets better. I thought, for the most part that the defence were good but Lovren is a weak link. Also thought it showed how much we rely on Henderson when he went off (I never thought I'd say that!). Why oh why does Lalalana start?! He must be the first one out when Firmino gets match fit. I think Rogers will start with Can Henderson (if fit) and Milner against Arsenal.

Then he's offering nothing going forward because he knows he hasn't got the pace regardless of his awareness or positioning. I'd dread to watch him up against Hazard, Sanchez, Depay, Sterling or even Montero.


Then as a result of Gomez not coming forward in support Ibe is isolated. He gets doubleteamed constantly because he has no full back support and loses the ball by either trying to take them on and overrunning it or by holding on to the ball too long instead of passing. He just hasn't got the awareness yet and tries to cut in and hit it too often. Far from the finished product and IMO shouldn't be starting yet if everyone is fit.

null,null,ScottyB330,num42,,null,"1) I don't boo, myself, and I staunchly agree with all those who think booing during the game itself is not only a bad look but could negatively impact the players.

2) The idea that booing after a match is a thing that should *never* happen appears to be a cultural difference between English and American fans. If in England booing by home fans at *any* point, ever, is considered a grave sin, then it must be said that booing the team after the Stoke game was poor form.

However, from my American fan perspective, booing after a game is not and should not be confused as supporting the team less or being a fake fan, etc. The overall performance was sub-par in the second half, and the fans rightfully let it be known. Professional athletes unable to receive this most basic of feedback without crumbling into a ball or demanding a transfer probably aren't mentally strong enough in the first place. Booing a specific player for poor performance is slightly different, and I don't like this--I am in fact very proud of the support Bobby was shown over the past two years, and I hope Lamela is afforded the same courtesy.

So, to summarize my point:

--Booing a bad team performance *after* the game is the equivalent of a collective thumbs down, imo. The players and fans alike should know that this comes from a place of passion and devotion to the club, rather than fair weather fanning.

--Booing a specific player for being out of form would seem to be counterproductive.",null,0,null,1439846717,null,null,false,0,cu6bzw2,null,t3_3hak08,null,null,null,t3_3hak08,null,null,null,1441309598,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,null,petethepool,null,null,null,"That's nonsense- did you watch the game? Literally nobody played badly, for a start- lallana made some crucial tackles in around the box, he was the only other player than coutinio comfortable running with the ball for more than a few seconds, and generally he was always involved. Ibe stretched play well and defended well. Ok he didn't produce much attacking wise but he rarely lost possession and was strong as always on the ball. He's only starting too, obviously, because Firmino isn't fit enough to start yet. In a few weeks ibe will be back to the bench. Can made a few good tackles and a few good passes, yeah, but he also gave the ball away several times, lost his man in midfield (which led to two almost-chances). Don't get me wrong I'm a big big fan of Can but where you're getting your statement from I don't know. 

But the major point stands- why do you have to criticise anyone when the team as a whole played so well as a unit? You're just stating blind opinion based on current 'trending' ideas, rather than the last 90 minutes. 

Moreno, for instance, did brilliantly for 10 minutes as a second left back, but would you rather he started over ibe? To me the whole game was managed very well. Henderson and Milner did very well, in fact as soon as Henderson was taken off (and can brought on) Bournemouth had their best spell of possession, and that was the only change BR hadn't planned for. 

Please watch the game objectively and support the players, I feel like so many people here have hypothesised so much  all summer (Can can never play as a DM, anyone?) and despite what is actually taking place presently on the pitch, their opinions are still holding more sway than actual reality.

I'd love a chairman to come in who loves the club, but the fact is is that Everton Football Club is stagnating right now, while all others around us strengthen.

Under the current board (which has fucked up two/soon to be three proposed ground moves) we'll still be in Goodison in ten years, while teams around us (and across the park) have either improved their current dwellings or moved on to bigger and better. That's not on and we shouldn't accept it.
That's only one example of the ineptitude Kenwright and Co. are guilty of. Our ground is shit. You can't buy a shirt outside of two shops in Liverpool or online. The board haven't invested a single penny since they came in. They've been looking for investment/a buyer for 16 years and found nothing, despite a ""24/7"" search by Bill himself! The lies and lack of transparency about the failed Fortress Fund/NTL/Everton Place are unacceptable.

Not expecting a meteoric City-like rise at all, but Everton Football Club should be challenging for trophies like we used to, not happily accepting 7th/8th like a lot of fans have been conditioned to.

Great game on Saturday, but one great performance can't hide what's happening at board level. In ten years, if we've still got the same people at the helm, everyone else (West Ham, Stoke, Spurs etc.) will be getting stronger and stronger and we'll be sat at the bottom of the pack.

And this is what I meant earlier when I said that the left never loses. It either never ran or people were hoodwinked by the media. I believe Ed Miliband was left-wing because that's what he campaigned upon. He said New Labour was dead. He said he wanted to pursue his version of socialism. I linked to these cases above when you incorrectly claimed that Ed Miliband was representative of New Labour - a case you're still trying to make now. 

However, He wanted to introduce [price controls](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24213366), he wanted to raise taxes [higher than Gordon Brown](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/8034851/Ed-Miliband-I-would-raise-taxes-higher-than-Gordon-Brown.html) and he wanted to introduce [rent controls](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2015/apr/26/labour-rent-control-plans-explained-ed-miliband).

null,null,Yakr,flair3,,null,"Tony Pulis has made a £5 million bid for Tottenham Hotspur defender Federico Fazio in a move which raises further doubts over the future of Joleon Lescott.
Pulis is close to signing Fazio, the Argentina international, after agreeing a fee with Spurs as he steps up his hunt for new signings.

Fazio only joined Spurs from Sevilla last August in an £8 million deal and is understood to be considering the move to the Hawthorns, with personal terms not thought to be an issue.

The 28-year-old’s arrival will increase uncertainty over Lescott, who was dropped for Saturday’s game at Watford and is attracting interest from Aston Villa and Stoke City.

Albion have also signed James Chester from Hull City this summer and Lescott could opt to leave before the transfer window closes.

Pulis is also on the verge of signing Cardiff City goalkeeper David Marshall later this week after deciding to meet the Championship club’s £5 million valuation.
West Brom transfer news: Baggies to sign Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall for £5 million

Tony Pulis is on the verge of signing goalkeeper David Marshall
Marshall has been suspended for the opening three games of the season but should complete his return to the Premier League before the weekend.

Albion have signed five players so far this summer, including £12 million record buy Salomon Rondon, and Pulis wants at least another three recruits.

Saido Berahino could leave in the next fortnight, however, with Spurs set to make an opening bid later this week.

Clyne edges Coutinho for me. Phil was great in the first half but missed a great chance and tired in the second, Clyne was just excellent all game. Defended well, got up the pitch, played a few good through balls, created the chance Benteke should have put away at the end... I remember him having one difficult moment (in the first half, when he let the ball bounce and then got sandwiched between 2 Bournemouth players) but he was pretty much flawless the rest of the match. If you don't love Nathaniel Clyne you're a Tory. Coutinho as runner-up.

**Moment of the Match** 

Can coming on and winning his first tackle while falling down and getting kicked in the head. 

Benteke winning the ball on the left flank (on two separate occasions), Henderson hitting the bar and Ben juggling the ball half the Bournemouth team all come close.

**Stray Observations:**

Lallana was better in the final 15 minutes than he was in the first 75. I know he's going to start against Arsenal but some part of me is still hoping we see Milner-Can-Hendo and Firmino-Coutinho playing behind Benteke.

Ibe was vitally important, a major part of what helped us get control of the first half was that his running and power pushed Bournemouth back, broke their aggressive shape and gave Coutinho the room to operate in. I don't think he's ready yet to be an automatic starter, but the lack of wingers in the squad makes him doubly valuable. Moreno did something similar in the second half, and Markovic provided the same kind of galloping threat last season.

Coutinho was definitely tired after about the 55th minute. Damn Copa America. 

Joe Gomez has amazing positional sense, best seen in the way he wins headers against bigger and stronger opponents - there were a couple times he looked like he was beaten but he was actually in just the right place to direct the ball away, rather than thump it clear. He also covers really well for Lovren and makes him look a better defender than he's been these last 2 games. Really impressed with the kid, even if he still clearly has some way to go. 

I wish we had a couple more weeks to get everything together before the Arsenal game. ",null,0,null,1439848661,null,null,1439854621,0,cu6d7gn,null,t3_3hd0bv,null,null,null,t3_3hd0bv,null,null,null,1441310168,null,4,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

As for the section 6 offence, 'A' has to show the image without 'B' consenting *and* without any reasonable belief that B consents.  But in this case, A had reasonable belief that B consented since they were talking about porn being blocked and B asked for pornography to be sent.

This says more about the problems the Labour Party has in general though, rather than a problem with Corbyn himself. The right of the party has decided that only it can win elections, and it'd be more interested in scuppering its own leader than just going with the democratic will of those who have voted. 

If they launch a coup on Corbyn, they can kiss any election victory in 2020 goodbye, because they would, quite rightly, be seen as a set of disloyal backstabbing bastards.

&gt;I think you're partially right though, Labour has effectively conceded the centre ground to the conservatives now.

This concept of the centre ground needs re-evaluating. The centre ground isn't in the centre, it's to the right of the centre. That's why a Labour Party occupying the centre ground is 'Tory Lite'. Essentially, the Tories are Tory Lite.

If that was the case, they surely would continue to play poorly which would a) look awful on him and b) cost us points - neither are things Rodgers would want.

I'm not Lovren's biggest fan by any means, but he hasn't been awful lately. He's a confidence player and is lacking that right now. Lallana is also a great player, even managing to get into team of the season 2 years ago. 

Think about firstly how Liverpool play. There is almost no protection to the centre backs which would make the job of any defender much harder if they were in that position. And think of all the new players that Lallana has to play alongside. It's going to take time for him and the others to get up to speed but when they do Lallana will look great, I'm certain of it. In fact when he dropped deeper tonight against Bournemouth he looked a lot better. He's someone who needs space to operate and it's hard to get that playing high and wide against the full back.

End of the day, they haven't been pretty but two wins and clean sheets against great opposition in Stoke and a very fiery team with a point to prove in Bournemouth is evidence that both are working at the moment.

Why do you think the stupidly complicated way they are designed, with Division 1 teams facing the possibility of 6 games before getting into the SPL when the SPL team only has 2 to retain their place?

They are not designed to actually allow the Division 1 teams to come up, just to produce the illusion of the Division 1 team possibly coming up.  If things had worked out the way they wanted, I could see them announcing in a few years time they were ending because they clearly weren't working.  The problem with the first play offs is that no-one anticipated how good Hamilton under Neil/how bad Hibs under Butcher/both would be.

They did do their job last season in preventing the Division 1 team coming up.  The problem is that Rangers were never actually supposed to be that team, never mind having to play the full 6 games.  Rangers were supposed to get promotion through winning the league, even after Hearts and Hibs got relegated.

Watch this: if it's getting to the end of the season and there's a chance that Rangers will be in the play offs again, they'll propose a change to the system to second bottom plays fouth, second plays third, winners in the final.  Clubs will vote for it because it makes sense.  But, if Rangers look like winning the league at a canter (which, to be fair, looks like it could happen), they'll do fuck all.

If you bring more of the range into the entire painting, it'll help you achieve better volume of forms and visual drama.

Second piece of unsolicited advice: use the biggest brush you can handle. A 1 inch, or 1.5 inch brush on a canvas this size will make it so you get less fussy planes of color, and will ultimately give you a more paintingy finished product. Use that for as long as you can before going down to a medium brush.

First watched him a few years ago with Ajax. Love the way he makes things look so easy and is absolutely lethal creating and scoring chances from Midfield. Another thing I really like about him is that he isn't a big whiner or talker. He just handles his business and doesn't complain about fouls much(Messi is the same way). I really respect that, particularly in a time which it seems almost all footballers (especially so many of the top players) seem to be so damn dramatic.

*Fear Her*, *Love and Monsters*, *Tooth and Claw* I think are worse than the Slitheen Trilogy. But I like the Slitheen Trilogy, so there's that.


&gt;Because of James Corden, I assume?

Little bit, but I also just didn't find the stories or characters interesting.


&gt;Why do you dislike Missy, Amy, and River? And, indeed, series 5?

There's nothing wrong with the way Missy was written, I just don't find 'baddies' that are crazy as incredibly interesting characters. I like Delgado because he is calm and measured, most of the time, because that's the kind of villain I like. Even Simm had little moments of it, but Gomez is just crazy all of the time.

Amy, I just don't like her character development. It's not that I don't like the character per se, but I find her development badly written. She did seem to be someone who had been subject to lots of mental testing and examining but they never really touch upon it.
And throughout series 5, she doesn't really develop all that much either. 

It's not so much that I dislike her, but I certainly don't like her as much everyone else seems to. 

It also comes and goes, sometimes I watch it and I like her but then sometimes I don't.
I also hated seeing her in *Time of the Doctor*, but that's a different thing.


Although, I dislike River. Her relationship with the Doctor is unrealistic. I mean, the Doctor, who is very against the principle of killing (yeah, I know he does kill but we'll just gloss over that) and yet he is happily with someone whose first response is to shoot and kill. And she develops into a point where her entire character is her love for the Doctor and not much else. 

And she, and other characters I'll admit, sexualised in such a weird way. Maybe that's just my personal preferences, but I find it weird.


I usually judge how much I like a series by how many episodes I can easily name after I've watched it and any important plot details. And I constantly find myself forgetting a few of series 5 because they are just, well, unremarkable and bland.

null,null,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Right, here's the thing. Firstly I'm a **huge** fan of Sakho. I want to make that abundantly clear. He's absolutely fantastic. He's a better footballer &amp; defender than Lovren and Skrtel. That's my opinion and I'll stand by that 100%, but OP makes a very good point.

Sakho has struggled with injuries, and its probably worth noting that a large portion of Sakho's injuries take place on the field, not in training or freak gym accidents. It's usually muscular. It could well be that the club are trying to improve his overall fitness and muscular health before putting him back into the squad so that we as a club get the very best out of him as a player. I can completely understand any reservation Brendan has towards Sakho regarding his injury record, because it's not great and if Rodgers is using up 1 of his 3 substitutes on an injured defender every so often, it could be the difference between bringing on an Emre Can or a Roberto Firmino and completely changing the complexion of the game later on or having 20 minutes left and getting the team 3 points and not having the option and losing the game.

Also, I've been very critical of Lovren since he came in. I still don't believe he was anywhere close to the fee we paid (don't think anyone would argue that point) but he's here now and to give up on him as supporters would be pretty pathetic. He's actually done a stand-up job in the first two games this season and I don't believe Sakho should walk straight back into the line up if Lovren's form continues, the same way that Daniel Agger didn't walk into the line-up when Sakho's form continued. Will Sakho throw his toys out of the pram when he has to fight for his place? I don't think so, no, but if he does, so be it. 

I think there's **far** more to Brendan just simply 'not liking' Sakho or showing favoritism towards Lovren &amp; Skrtel going on to leave him out of the squad completely. I have enough faith in the club and the manager to see, how most of us see Sakho, in that he's an incredibly talented defender who could become absolutely huge for us in the future if he can stay fit. 

TL;DR: Always two sides to the coin and I don't think this story is as black and white as Brendan having favourites.",null,0,null,1439853475,null,null,false,0,cu6fzrf,null,t3_3hdfhp,null,null,null,t3_3hdfhp,null,null,null,1441311481,null,17,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17,null

I don't really get this World vs EU argument because its simply not true. Britain continues to trade and work with other countries while still being part of the EU. 

The benefits of the free movement are also a huge draw.

I think the biggest myth that many young people see through with the Euroskeptics is the sovereignty argument. This whole ""we need to take control"". Its the ""We"" concept. Now when Euroskeptics mean ""we"" they mean the government, and when they mean take control they mean taking away you the individual right to have direct say on inter European relations. Before the EU only Civil Servants and government officials got say on Inter European wide deals (and yes there was a deals even before the EU). Now we get a say on things more directly. I don't want to lose that right, do you? 

The EU may have a lot of problems, but for the last 10 years its tried really hard to appeal to young people with great success. The EU has pushed for things like Erasmus, Youth Employment Package etc. They really have done a hell of a lot to educate young people to understand how the European Union works to get more people to actually access it, use it and be part of it more then most governments. 

So I actually think the one area or at least people the EU has tried to do a lot for is young people.

Finally I really don't understand this ""Poor Russia vs Imperial EU"" narrative that seems to be going around. Russian military is still massive compared to EU. Also all members of the EU chose independently to join none were forced. Again Russia Imperial expansion into Georgia, Crimea and East Ukraine can hardly be called ""self-defense"" when the EU was unlikely to accept any of those countries any time soon.

I also think you've fallen into the Corbyn vs Conservatism trap, where this sort of dichotomy underpins the whole left/right issue -- even as within Labour because it (falsely) associates the other candidates with the Tories. 

So yeah, tuition fees/childcare are to the left of the Tories, but it is also to the left of Labour's own centre point. It's basically a Green Party policy. It's definitely hard left. Just left or soft left would be something like reducing tuition fees, e.g.

null,null,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,null,"&gt;Not being a Labour supporter, I'd just rather have a party in opposition that actually offers some real opposition, and that can drag the political discussion in general back towards the left. 

I think the problem with this approach is the assumption on how the centre ground moves. At first glance it might seem like it's just the sort of ""centre of gravity"" between the positions of the two main parties - but that is not what it is.

The centre ground is a large blob of people who first need to be persuaded that you're on their side, and then gently persuaded round to your point of view while attacking your opponents on their own ground. That way, you control the direction of the debate, you ask the important questions, you hold the votes of the swing seats which generally tend to vote together. At the very least, this is how it works in a first past the post voting system. (A system under which Corbyn would have to win under before having any chance of changing it.)

OP goes into more detail above, but the important issues to the centre ground are immigration and the economy, in particular the budget deficit. You would say that this is a Tory agenda, and you'd be right, because the Tories control the centre ground right now. 

The way you move the centre ground leftwards is to first concede the issues that you have to in order for swing voters to even listen to you in the first place, and then emphasize the issues that matter to *you* which will win them over. But you first have to establish their trust, which Miliband never managed to do, and Corbyn certainly won't. 

This gets you into Government, and once there you can obviously focus on the issues that matter to non-swing voters, which will also have featured in your manifesto and been given an appropriate amount of airtime beforehand. Depending on the size of your majority, you might want to bring in a further left agenda than you planned, but never ""full communism now"", because you'll want to seek re-election. However, if you win a large majority and dominate the centre ground and move it leftwards, the chances are the opposition will give you a free election or three anyway.

&gt;The way the other candidates, and Blair, Brown, etc etc have all come out to attack him is fucking pathetic.

It's not pathetic, it's genuinely a warning from people who have a lot of experience winning and losing elections. Jeremy wouldn't just lose Labour the election, we'd lose it badly - 200 seats, or less. No other candidate could manage such a poor result, and Kendall might even have won.

So if Corbyn can't win, he isn't offering ""real opposition"", because what happens when the opposition retreats from the centre ground? The Tories bring it further to the right - because that's exactly what we did in power but to the left. No wonder the Tories want Corbyn to win - it won't just keep them in power, it will give them the confidence to do even more damage than they ever thought they could. And they'll get away with it too, and remain in control of the centre.

Single sex schools were the norm up until the 60's/70's in the UK, incidentally. It's a lot more recent than the 19th century.

&gt; Replace gender with colour and this would be something you would hear in desegregation 1960s America, how are people still having this argument in this day and age.

Segregation in the US was a device for providing black people with a substandard education. Most of the single-sex education which has gone on over the last 30-50 years (and still goes on) is in traditional private and grammar schools, where the results are excellent for both genders. If anything, you could argue that single sex girls schools provide a bulwark against traditional gender roles being enforced on girls - hence the stereotype of the sturdy hockey player who is more interested in getting shit done rather than prettifying herself.

It's probably not a good idea, but it's absurd to wheel out all the '5th century Islamic doctrine' rhetoric (+18 above) when talking about something which was near ubiquitous in our own culture until 50 years ago.",null,0,null,1439854543,null,null,1439856017,0,cu6gl3j,null,t3_3hc8ow,null,null,null,t1_cu64q9d,null,null,null,1441311761,null,12,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

Schurrle might have lost the ball more, but at least he fucking tries more.

Willian is great in the first 2/3rds of the pitch with his work rate, but once he's in the final third he plays too passive.

I also have a Gigabyte-GA-Z77-D3H Motherboard I will bundle in with the GTX 770, the i5-3570k and the 8GB ram if you buy them together. I also have a Hyper Evo 212 with 2 fans you can have if you buy the 'Bundle'

null,null,severedfragile,lfc68,,null,"Yeah, I think he'll hold the position for the time being. Rodgers clearly likes him (and he tends to keep around the guys he trusts) and he's played pretty well in both games so far. He's just better defensively than Moreno (who's a machine at getting up and down the pitch but needs cover and distribution to be effective) and that's been a big part of why we've kept teams from threatening. He gives Lovren a lot of cover and cleans up for him when necessary.

His major strengths are his positioning (very comfortable, doesn't get beat in the air by bigger opponents, good supporting work for his teammates) and his speed, which he again uses very well for recovery. He's got that intangible mental ability that good defensive players need to have. He might not fly up the pitch (though he seems capable of it, based on brief flashes with Liverpool and clips I've seen) but his stability and straightforward play bring some stability and calmness to the defence, which in turn allows others to be a bit more expansive. 

Weaknesses... he's definitely inexperienced, and sometimes doesn't know the right move to make (a good example was in this game where he mishit a clearance and then struggled to clear the loose ball - 10 more games under his belt and he might have put that ball out more calmly instead of letting Bournemouth back in to attack. We also haven't seen him against mobile team play (which we will next week) so it's hard to gauge his reading of movement and opposition tactics. He could also do with more muscle. So largely, it points back to his youth and is stuff he will hopefully improve on as he develops. 

It's hard to evaluate him in too much detail after only having watched him twice in competitive games and a bit in friendlies, but he's looking like a great young player with a real future at Liverpool.

We already rely on the fullbacks to provide width so this formation is nothing new, Dembele/Chadli were narrow against Stoke (to team detriment) and even in our dismantling of Chelsea last season we played with inverted Chadli/Townsend.

With Dembele drifting inwards but not performing poorly I wouldn't be opposed to giving him a whirl in the middle opening up the RW spot for Berahino (assuming he comes).

How they're treated depends from team to team. If a club is struggling to survive or to push in the league then they'll neglect the cup. If a team can afford to or isn't expected to better their league position they may go for cup glory. 

The champions league is not a league but another cup competition for the best teams from each league in europe (UEFA). The number of teams from each league depends on the ranking of that league which depends on how well the teams do in European competitions.  Currently the top four teams of the premier league are able to play in the champions league, though they don't all enter at the same stage. The Champions league is very prestigious and can be a big money maker.

Benteke was really positive throughout the match - great first touches, physical presence and the start of what seems to be a good connection with Coutinho. 

Clyne was just staggeringly good - our best player on the pitch the full 90 minutes. Hendo had to come off early 2nd half, seems he's been carrying a knock. 

Can came in for him and interestingly, that pushed Lallana deeper. Milner was consistently solid and seems to have a good rapport with Clyne already. Offensively Ibe and Lallana were poor. In general any movement through our left flank with Gomez and Ibe was pretty much a dead-end alley. 

Moreno came on for Gomez for 10 minutes and looked staggeringly good - though it was just the last 10 minutes and everyone was gassed. Overall, Bouremouth dominated the 2nd half, we seemed content to just sit back and nurse the narrow lead. It was nerve-wracking, but not as nerve-wracking as some of our other narrow wins have been... 

Overall, Benteke and Clyne looked enormously promising, but our midfield - shape/pace/pressing - lacked fluidity. Defensively we were just ok I think, Skrtel a little iffy.

A large proportion will either note vote or vote Green/SNP/Plaid (more than this election) and the anti-politics votes you might have picked up from UKIP would be gone as well. 

There's no easy answer here. Boundary changes will hit us hard, the electorate seemingly want different things in different parts of England, let alone the UK. The EU referendum and the global economy will both play a part in how popular the Tories are, as will their new leader. 

Basically there's a metric fuckton of variables here and a lot of the polling can be read several ways. I actually think the Blairites are victims of their own triangulation success here and politics has moved on but also people are more complex than the old labels. I'm left wing as hell but vaguely EU sceptic, for controlled inmigration and tough action on unemployment (though I'd want carrot and stick). ""Common sense"" is the watchword rather than right or left. You say people are socially conservative but support for homosexuality and casual drug use has gone up. The labels are too broad. 

The old style of Blairite politics is playing to an ever smaller audience who is far more street wise and cynical than in the 90s.

In short, I think a lot of what you say has merit. I agree that Corbyn is too left wing on areas like welfare fraud and immigration. However I disagree with your conclusion that anyone else is better. Corbyn has something, even if he doesn't have everything. People vote on more than just the policy offering for a start. IMO Labour isn't going to win in 2020 with any of the candidates as leader. Burnham maybe, if he's against someone other than Boris and if the public don't go mental over Mid Staffs and if he comes across as a lot more sincere than he is.

Given that agents are working at the behest of the players, it really seems like Cuadrado has never settled here and doesn't really want to fight for his place. It may be better to jettison him, cut our losses soon, and also, it would be pointless to keep what apparently seems an unhappy player here. 

That makes sense from the standpoint that I don't really think that Chelsea, Mourinho, and the board, would give up a player 6 months after they spent nearly 25m on. They clearly believed in him enough to let Schurrle go, and they thought he was the right player for the system.

Gomez is clearly not fazed by the higher level and should play his strongest position in his toughest challenge yet. I think it's riskier playing him out of position and we will be caught out in a big game.

Firmino cause Lallana is just not fitting in for some reason. Do we need to get J Rodriguez?

edgy 


&gt;The fact that thousands of people here had to resort to fleeing NI for refugee camps across the border after unprovoked attacks on their homes, and the RUCs continued failure to stop these attacks


A mob of 600 smashed up anything protestant they could find in limerick yet my mind goes blank to the part when protestants started bombing. That is just one example of sectarian rampages in the Free state. The Ne Temere was widely accepted and eventually wiped out most of the protestant population. Not only were protestants made to feel not welcome but denied the right to exist by forcing the children of mixed marriages to be brought up catholic or risk the catholic side of the family being shunned.


&gt;every army and every armed organisation in history is responsible for murdering innocents

Most don't set out to do it. I have to laugh at how republicans try to justify mass murder.

Not really. 'Terrorist/Terrorism' can be used to define any armed group, any army in the world:

&gt;&gt; noun

&gt;&gt;
 The use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal.

Any war, conflict, battle etc falls under this.

&gt; A mob of 600 smashed up anything protestant they could find in limerick yet my mind goes blank to the part when protestants started bombing. That is just one example of sectarian rampages in the Free state. 

Who the fucks talking about the *free state* here?

&gt; The Ne Temere was widely accepted and eventually wiped out most of the protestant population.

Nice choice of words there - almost sounds like you mean people killed all the protestants rather than y'know, normal demographic shifts and Irelands usual massive emmigration percentage etc. According to the last two censuses, the number of Roman Catholicis has went up .6% in the last ten years, whereas Presbyterianism, Church of Ireland and Methodists and other Christian secs have all declined - that due to the Ne Temere too yeah?

&gt; Most don't set out to do it. 

Neither did the Provos - they set out to free Ireland.

&gt; I have to laugh at how republicans try to justify mass murder.

Likewise, I have to laugh at how people can't see that in a place where democracy didn't exist, where people fled to refugee camps, didn't have the right to vote, whose civil rights marches were shot and beaten by the police etc - don't see how armed rebellion was inevitable and a direct result of their treatment to a significant amount of the population.

&gt; Did i not explain how they were bullshit

No, you didn't - you dismissed it with ""aye but they used a proxy"", as if somehow the warning didn't make it through.

Say I don't work on Tuesday. I'll most likely not drink because I'm not out or don't want to (its good to have a break). 

Wednesday I finish at 8 and will have two pints of medium strength (5 - 7% beer) then go home.

Thursday I'll have maybe 4 pints after work at a (brief) lock-in till round about 2 in the morning.

Friday will mean stopping at 10 and having the same if not one less or one more. 

Saturday means I have a beer event and will have maybe 6 - 8 pints at that event. Not including two after work to ""warm up""/wait for a friend. This won't  always be full pints and will some times be various halves of 7-8% IPA/Stout.

Sunday I might have a glass of wine with dinner but will most likely not drink.

How elese would you phrase it. That is the reality. The population was wiped out
&gt;According to the last two censuses, the number of Roman Catholicis has went up .6% in the last ten years, whereas Presbyterianism, Church of Ireland and Methodists and other Christian secs have all declined - that due to the Ne Temere too yeah?


Are you denying the Ne Temere had any affect on the Protestant population. I don't think theres many historians who would deny it. Its pretty clear what happened. You don't have to disagree with me to ""win"" an argument. Facts are facts.


&gt;According to the last two censuses, the number of Roman Catholicis has went up .6% in the last ten years, whereas Presbyterianism, Church of Ireland and Methodists and other Christian secs have all declined - that due to the Ne Temere too yeah?

Did anyone say that. The Ne Temere was changed in the 70s anyway. I'll tell you about demographics as I've taken interest in the census. Protestant and Catholic emigration is roughly the same. The reason the catholic population stays stagnant and rises in some parts is because there are catholic immigrants to replace the catholic emigrants. Theres no large numbers of protestant immigrants to replace the protestant emigrants. Before 2004 this wasn't the case. Of course that is 1 out of many reasons but it is the main factor. Other reasons includes protestants turning to irreligion seen across the anglosphere.

&gt;free

I used to consider you as a reasonable nationalist but now you're making me laugh. Thank fuck they failed that anyway. They'll have to plant a few more pipe bombs in housing estates and we might get there. Deluded teenage romanticism 

&gt;Likewise, I have to laugh at how people can't see that in a place where democracy didn't exist, where people fled to refugee camps, didn't have the right to vote, whose civil rights marches were shot and beaten by the police etc - don't see how armed rebellion was inevitable and a direct result of their treatment to a significant amount of the population.


When did all that stop though. I'd argue in the mid-late 70s but the IRA kept going and took away peoples right to live why taking the moral high ground of giving rights.

1) The Doctor was right and there is a creature that is such a perfect hider that even with Time Lord technology they couldn't pin it down for sure. This creature was responsible for all or most of the events in the episode.

2) There was no creature. The Doctor can be absent minded and has his own fears which lead him to ignore that the writing was in his hand writing, the events in Ruperts room were a weird kid in a mask trying to be scary or an unrelated alien (because it's Doctor Who and there's aliens bloody every where), etc. 

The episode never tells us which way it is for sure. The reason for that ambiguity is that if forces the viewer into the same position as the Doctor and allows the episode to subvert the tropes of the show. The real moral of the episode was that no matter who you are, there will be things you don't know and things that scare you but that's ok! You can accept your fears and use them to motivate your own growth just as the Doctor has. If the Doctor or the viewer got a final answer, it would undermine the real point of the episode and make it far less engaging and meaningful than it actually was.

Also, as a quick side note: the episode could have wider reprocussions because Moffat has indicated that they were only able to move back along the Doctor's time line to get to the barn because after  *The Day of the Doctor* we are now in a version of the universe where the Moment has broken the Time Lock.

* Ivanovic scored big goals but was uneven defensively and isn't getting any younger or quicker.
* Willian is a hard worker and provides defensive cover and a counter-attacking threat but his offensive production is nowhere near good enough for a 30+ million pound signing who starts in attacking midfield nearly every game for one of the best teams in the world.
* Oscar seems to be up and down every season with no real consistency in his performances. I know he does a lot of dirty work for the team and is important in the link-up between CMs and AMs but even so he'll have a few matches where he really shows his overall potential and then is nearly invisible for a month. He's yet to be a consistent goal or assist threat.
* Fabregas dropped off in the 2nd half of the season like he had the couple of years previous. He was admittedly terrific in the 1st half but it was a little bit worrying to see.

There are more examples and some of this might be considered nitpicky, but I definitely think we need more week-in, week-out competition for places. Coming into the season I didn't think a carbon copy lineup from last year would be good enough to retain the title and through most of preseason and now 2 games we've looked pretty dismal. Lots of the other title contenders improved significantly and Chelsea has essentially stood-pat when it comes to the starting lineup.

But here's the thing, and I think my main point of contention.  Is a manager's job to refuse to play men who 'fit' his highly-specific, pre-ordained system?  Or is it to figure out the right system for the actual players at his disposal?

My biggest gripe about Poch is that instead of actually playing the hand he was dealt, last season he just threw all the toys out of the pram he didn't want (including, let's not forget, players like Fazio, Stambouli and Davies who were signed on his watch) and wanted new ones.  That's not how management works.

How many managers in the EPL can truly have claimed to built their squad from scratch other than Wenger?  None.  So management is less about playing goddamn Mason until he's a burnt out husk costing us games, and actually be flexible in your tactics, lineup and man management in order to leverage what you've got into actual points.

This team will finish top 4 at best and the main reason we won the league last year is because of how badly the other teams played. 




The rest of the title contenders have gotten better while we have not, we might even be worse. 




We basically can only attack through the left or middle because of how poor Willian and Ivanovic are. Ramires is a complete dud. He can't pass, shoot, dribble, always out of position, red card waiting to happen. Willian is slightly better. With these two on the pitch I basically see it as playing witj 9 players. As soon as either one get the ball I know 9/10 times nothing will happen. Ivanovic is too slow to be a fullback, and he only gets worse with age. He offers nothing going forward so with him, Willian, Ramires we might as well be playing with 8 players on offense.




I don't understand why we didn't play Azpi at RB and Luis at LB. Two of the best fullbacks in the world. Don't understand why Moses hasn't gotten a chance at RW yet. Don't understand why Zouma isn't chosen over Cahill...hell even over JT with the way he's played so far this year.

Now I've been following her for a while and she voted green at the election and was big on that green-snp-plaid 'progressive alliance' idea, she'd probably agree with you that labour 2015 were too close to the tories. The thing is, rent control and zero hours were both part of Milliband's platform and arguably 'ending the reign of bankers' was at least partially there with the announcement on non-doms and the policy of increased banking regulations.

So you know, he wasn't very close at all, and I despair that people apparently think he was.

Enrique has also often featured at the ends of matches in a similar way and done basically the same thing. 

I think Moreno should start if Arsenal go with pace and Gomez should start if they go with someone like Ramsey. But my own idea may be flawed, because Gomez doesn't really maraud forward and so having him play against a pacy winger might make more sense. Whereas Moreno is more likely to get caught out (even if he's more likely to track back).

It's a lot to consider. Ultimately I think the only MUST is that we drop Ibe for Can (assuming Hendo is healthy). Ibe has shown nothing to me this season and I think Lallana has seen less of the ball because he's being forced to float all over without ever being the clear outlet. 

Ibe should be an impact sub this season and maybe get runs in the cups.

null,null,Samtze,null,null,null,"You basically approach the freeholder once your lease reaches a term that is unacceptable to most lenders and therefore difficult to get a mortgage/sell. This ranges from 65-85 years remaining, although some lenders only requiring 40 years beyond the mortgage term. Each sets their own criteria. 

In regards to lease extension negotiations most people employ a solicitor to approach the freeholder who then quotes a figure for extension. This can range wildy depending on a multitude of factors. The amount is unlikely to be 50% of the property value but as a recent example a 1970 built flat with 65 year lease remaining cost 12k to extend. Rather than pay this amount everyone in this block (12 flats) decided to buy a share of the freehold and granted themselves 999 year leases.

You can employ a lease extension surveyor who can provide a lease extensions valuation figure which you can take to your freeholder. I'm not totally sure of how this process works as its out of my expertise, but as far as I'm aware it can end up saving you thousands over just taking the first figure quotes by the freeholder and stumping up the cash.

I'm honestly not impressed with City this transfer window (I can't judge Delph, but he doesnt's eem like a world beater to me).  I think they're paying world class money for talent that isn't world class.

Sterling: 50m is huge.  He definitely adds something different to City, and watching Neville's piece on MNF, he repeatedly points out that Sterling played a huge role in dismantling Chelsea.  

But at that price point, I would expect that, but I would also expect a player who can produce the spectacular.  I honestly think someone like Pedro would have been a better purchase, or Alexis Sanchez last season.  These are players who are tactically astute enough to stretch defenses, but can also astound on an individual level.  World class players for at least 20m cheaper (I know last year was FFP and CIty went for Sanchez in 2011, but he snubbed them, so there may be bad blood).  

But I think my point stands.

Ottamendi is a good player.  But he's had one very good season as a 27 year old.  I find that worrying.  It would be understandable if he was young or something, but this player is at his peak.  To me he sounds like a financial gamble rather than a surefire buy (in the form of Hummels or Barzagali).  In all honesty, I think Ottamendi is of the caliber when Demichellis went to Malaga...

I think these are good players, but waaaaay overpriced.  It also creates complications and a shortage of funds for when true star players are available (Pedro, Kovacic for only 30m euros?, Sanchez).  Maybe the club should try for Stones next year (I don't think he's going to Chelsea this season, but there is a good chance of it happening next year).  Or perhaps, focus on their own talent (I'm very disappointed that Rekik left, he seemed to be a good talent), and this does compromise in some way, Denayer's playing time.",null,1,null,1439875972,null,null,false,0,cu6rlpi,null,t3_3hecq7,null,null,null,t1_cu6poqe,null,null,null,1441317082,null,0,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0,null
