null,false,chrisjd,null,null,null,"&gt; Energy: Opposed to Nuclear, which I disagree with but understand - unworkable because current renewable technology will simply not meet our energy needs, even with massive investment and expansion. You can talk about reducing demand until you're blue in the face but it won't change people's behaviour. Brown-outs are incredibly damaging (more so than blackouts) and if we're not investing now for our future energy needs then we're ignoring the world's most predictable problems.

Ok, but have you seen this:

[Renewable sources of energy could meet between 60-90% of the UK’s electricity demand by 2030.](http://www.wwf.org.uk/wwf_articles.cfm?unewsid=5361)

And this:

[Nuclear power may not be needed, says top atomic advocate. 
Sir David King, former chief scientist and champion of the nuclear newbuild, says the top priority must be to develop storage for renewable energy.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/nuclearpower/11244499/Nuclear-power-may-not-be-needed-says-top-atomic-advocate.html)

Renewable and energy storage technology is moving at such a fast rate that the idea that Nuclear is necessary could soon be obsolete. We could allow for new Nuclear plants to be built, but in the 10 years it takes to build them they could just be an expensive and unnecessary way to produce power, as technology will have moved on. Now this might seem optimistic, but I'm basically repeating the words of the former chief scientist here, so i don't think it is unrealistic or unworkable. Investing in renewables and energy storage, and research into improving them, is a viable alternative to building more Nuclear plants (and it's worth pointing out that the Greens aren't going to shut down the current ones until they are end of life, that would be silly). 

I do think the Greens oppose Nuclear for wrong reasons, it's a knee-jerk reaction rather than a reasoned ones, and I don't think that we shouldn't rule anything out. But I think that Nuclear is a bit over-hyped, it's great because it doesn't have the indeterminacy problems that renewables do, but this problem could be overcome if we make breakthroughs in energy storage.

&gt; GM: At what point is a crop GM? Dwarf wheat is a GM crop, which saved the lives of billions. I loathe the monsato problem, but it's not black and white, and it's not so easy to just stop it when it's so widespread already.

Yeah I agree, their objections seem to be based partly on concerns about one or two big companies gaining a monopoly on over GM crops that the technology will be used purely for profit but not benefit the world. Add to that some overblown concerns about environmental contamination and that pretty much explains the policy. I hope it gets overturned one day, they are more pragmatic people in the party now.

&gt; If you banned the use of GM tomorrow farming in this country would collapse.

This is new to me, I didn't know use of GM crops was already so widespread?

&gt; Economic platform was a mess in 2010, I don't have time now to dig out the 2010 manifesto and go though it properly, but the numbers simply didn't add up.

Speak to your RAO for clearer details on the scheme as you need to check the hidden clauses i.e. does the  MoD own a share of the property until the loan is paid off, are you allowed to let the property if you are posted to a different location to where you are buying, or what happens if you are discharged or sign off before the term is up. The small print of up to 50% sound like to me that the manning control points are being used to set how much they will be willing to to lend i.e. 12+ years service would get 50% with 6 and 9 years service getting a smaller percentage. 

As for the other stuff you need to find an IFA to discuss your current personal finance state, your credit history will be key so if you have not already done so get on the electoral register, your current debts will turn some lenders off you so try to clear the loan and have evidence of how many years of child support you have outstanding,. Lenders will not take into account future promotion and bonus as they are not guaranteed they will however contact your CO to confirm you are serving in the forces and will want to see your last 3 payslips and your last p60 so keep that safe.

Moving out of the block or pads quarters into your own home is very expensive, big jumps in council tax, water and utilities bills, additional life, building, contents insurance and repair bills.

IF you manage to save £10k remember you need to pay legal costs which could cost more as you will be using two loans to pay for the property so some solicitors will charge more for that service.

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"I don't think that it's certain that pre-war events such as this are timelocked themselves. The Time War itself is (or rather was, see below) timelocked - that has been stated - and all the evidence suggests that the Doctor is now operating in a post-time-war version of the universe, but I don't think that it has been suggested that all the timelines beforehand are themselves actually timelocked.  

The Dalek invasion of Earth at that point seems fairly resilient to changes in the timelines, anyway. It was originally encountered before the *Genesis of the Daleks* interference, of course, but still happened in much the same way when Eight visited it again, afterwards, and when Six did in the recent *Masters of Earth*, it seems - though I've not heard that one myself yet. 

Looking at the post-war universe, the 2015 DW Annual includes a short story that appears to be set in this period too, with the Twelve and Clara there in the ruins of an invasion, although there is no *direct* mention of Daleks being the invaders. All of this leads me to wonder if this invasion is some type of Fixed Point in Time, which perhaps may have influenced the Doctor's original decision to leave Susan there.  

Whether it is a fixed point or not, though, Moffat has said in a recent DWM that the timelock is no longer in place anyway. This may be why Twelve could reach this point in the short story, I suppose. But the timelock having gone has a huge potential for other implications, so I don't know how much weight to give to that idea until we see something definite in-universe.

I get the impression that the upcoming charity anthology *Seasons of War* might touch on Susan's fate during the war, but since it is unofficial, how much you accept it is another matter.",null,0,null,1422280019,null,0,false,0,co18c98,null,t3_2tomcq,null,t1_co18c98,null,t1_co16ufx,null,null,null,1424384058,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

One of the problems is that most issues are dealt with by way of pay-offs with gagging clauses, so much of it doesn't make it into the public arena.  However we are starting to [see](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2014/9/ehp.1307732.pdf) a number of public health studies which show a quite strong effect, even if the numbers aren't huge and they are described as ""hypothesis generating"" rather than anything else.

A 'finished consultant episode' is roughly what we would regard as one episode of treatment - if the patient is transferred to a different speciality or hospital then that might double count, but in general it is one procedure.

The average costs of these operations was £4513 each (or £47m in total). The majority of this is either directly treating cancer (£11.5m), reconstruction following cancer (£12m) or unilateral (£16m). These cannot possibly be 'boob jobs', conventionally defined. Of the remaining £7m of spend, I think the catagory which contains 'vanity' boob jobs is 'bilateral intermediate breast procedures' (£900k). This includes reductions (which save the NHS a ton of money in MSK treatment further down the line) and reshaping following an accident (which saves the NHS a ton of money on treating body dismorphia disorders after the accident). Let's ignore that though, and call everything in that bucket 'vanity'. That means we're quibbling over what the NHS does with less than 0.001% of its budget, at a personal cost to you of about one pence per year.

Speaking anecdotally rather than with data, the NHS is pretty good at sifting 'genuine' cases of need from people who just want some free plastic surgery.

Compare that to the fact that people sitting on their arse in the office all day and getting diabetes (est. £20bn cost), obese (est. £8bn cost) and depressed (est. £5bn cost to NHS directly, maybe £80bn to economy as a whole) and I put it to you you have your priorities in the wrong order; we should be focusing less effort on catching 'scroungers' looking for free surgery (cost to NHS - &lt;£900,000) and more effort on catching those whose unhealthy lifestyle is going to cost the NHS a fortune in the future (cost to the NHS from just the three areas I named - ~£33bn). But every time someone like you gets outraged about the boob stuff, a commissioner has to ignore the folder marked 'stuff I can do to get obese people to exercise' and open a folder marked 'stuff I can say to placate the *Daily Mail* because we accidentally gave plastic surgery to a women who was a marginal case for it*. It wastes everybody's time, and the only benefit is to the people who get to feel the momentary thrill of outrage that comes from knowing only half the story.

I sympathise with anyone who has to go as part of benefits claims and I'm fully supportive of the benefits system. I think some of the loops you have to jump through to claim are not only ridiculous, they are borderline immoral.

With that said, I can't see much wrong with this form. I tailor my cover letter and CV to every job I apply for, even if just a little. Prepping my CV after a long period of no updates does take me a few hours and I'm horrendous at application forms.

Maybe I just like to put a lot of thought and effort into it, maybe I'm just a bit slower than everyone else but to me, taking a good 45 minutes to apply for a job seems reasonable.

People are huge victims of recency bias on here so when a player is in poor form they think everything about him is awful. The things that have been said about Schurrle this year are ridiculous. Seems like nobody wants to acknowledge Schurrle tracks back almost as much as Willian just because he's been in a bad offensive form. He forced so many errors and chances last season because of his pressing. If Schurrle can get back on good form, I think we solve the RW problem. He's fantastic going forward with a consistent shot, decent passing and crossing, and he makes world class off the ball runs to position himself/other for goals. 

I'm not talking about you at all, but I'm sick of some these fickle fans on this subreddit who turn on a player the second they get in a bit of bad form and say shit like, ""Schurrle does fuck all in his chances, he's shit."" How is he supposed to get back to form when he gets limited chances with mostly other rotated players or like 45 minutes when he does play with the stronger squad? This is a huge flaw we've had this season. Is it really a shock that guys like Schurrle, Ramires, Mikel and Filipe have been in poor form? The only exceptions are Remy and Cech. Cech is understandable because he's a keeper but Remy is in miraculous form considering how few minutes he gets and it's a crime that Drogba gets picked over him as much as I love Drogba.

Right, but you already don't have a job. You're already someone who can't pay their rent. 

Evicting tenants is difficult, time consuming and expensive, going through the process of eviction is not nice for any landlord (or agency if the agency is managing the property). They don't want to set themselves up for eviction. For most people with a job it's a safe bet to make that it's easy enough for them to find a new job because they're demonstrably employable, but there's no demonstration of your employability... because you don't have a job... and paying 3 or 6 months rent upfront is not going to change that.

You're going to run into this problem with every letting agent, and rightfully so.

Again, don't get me wrong, I think he could be a great addition, I just worry someone else may be unhappy with their playing time if we were to get Milner. I definitely would take him over Joe Allen (no offense to him) but would he really be in a better position to start than Man City?

Because the club doesn't want to make less money by selling cheaper tickets.

This is perhaps an area where the fans can do better, IMO you're going to see less passion for ""less important"" games, that's simply human nature (not an excuse, just an explanation). 

&gt;So, if we knock off, say, a fiver of the cost of a match day ticket - depending on your definition of a younger fan - how much difference do you think that will make? 

I'd advocate something more radical than a fiver...more like a 20-25% discount for young fans (probably something like U-25), commit to actually making a difference for them.

So the letting agents set a low percentage for the landlord, then make their money back by stinging the tenant.

Simply saying ""we are against the tory austerity plan, placing hardship on the weak"" is not an answer on taxation. What i have found 99% of people just do not understand taxation even slightly. Simply adding more taxes to us or the rich is more inequality.

Everyone in a free market should have the right to be rich if you earned it. The problem is that most rich people inherit their wealth and this is the abuse.

null,false,rembrant1,null,null,null,"I was excited when I heard we might be getting Van Gaal over the summer but after seeing what he has done at Man U, I am so happy we got Poch for several reasons.

1. VG spent an unheard of amount of money this off season and is still struggling to stay in the top 4. Just think if spurs got Di Maria or Blind or one of their creative wingers. We would be so much better as a team. But VG did the same thing Spurs did last season. He brought in a bunch of talent but got a bunch of players that play in the same position or dont fit the system they are trying to play. 

2. Poch knows how to get the most out of young talent and Spurs are one of the youngest teams in the BPL. He just needs a bit of time to mold them into the best players they can be.

3. Van Gaal can't create an identity over at Man U. He keeps trying to play 3 at the back when he doesnt have the players to do so. But his ego is too big to give up on that system instead of just switching to the 4-4-2 which Man U is better equipped to play. We are now starting to see Poch's identity in high press and high endurance.

4. With Poch we also got Pual Mitchell who is one of the top talent scouts in the country right now. And with spurs budget they need someone like this to help round out the squad this summer. (Not sure if Mitchell would have come if not for Poch but could be wrong)

You have £x cash, that could be gone tomorrow. You could be borrowing that money from a friend just to trick the letting agents, you could owe that money, you could gamble it all.

Wind you're way through here and then back into the middle to see the Bull Statue and St Martin's at the Bullring (the church).

Then maybe take a walk up New Street, passing the new station facade and several high street shops, heading towards Victoria Square. Here is the Town Hall (Modelled on the Parthenon) Birmingham Museum which is free to enter and has some excellent exhibits as others have noted. 

Now assuming you have some time left you will need to weave your way through Paradise forum, which is being knocked down to make way for a new hotel and a hoard of new shops, and through into centenary square. From here you can visit the Birmingham Library, there are 3 Gardens and a Shakespeare room hidden to varying degrees to find, and you can meet the man himself (well, a Brummie in tights) if you can find him!

Next through the ICC/Symphony hall building - The symphony hall is usually open on a Saturday to pop-your head in and take a look inside. At the far end of the ICC exit the doors and you are into Sherborne Wharf and Brindley place. This is one of the nicest parts of the Canal system, and a great place to get a drink or some food - then you can either take a stroll up Broad Street, or personally I'd walk along the Canals towards the Jewellery Quarter, and again as others have said, visit the home of the British Jewellery trade.

Depending on how long you expect to look at things en-route this can take an hour as a straight walk or 10 if you stop off and really take your time, however note that after 6ish it will mostly be bars and chain shops that are left open.

Then, as I said in my original comment:

&gt; You're going to run into this problem with every letting agent, and rightfully so.

This is just how renting properties works. Monthly income is the most important component, the majority of letting agents use that as consideration as to whether or not you can afford the property. The fact that you have money is completely irrelevant, it's the same as taking out a loan: a bank doesn't care if you have £20,000 sitting in the bank that you *could* use to repay the loan, it could be gone tomorrow!

&gt; They made it understood to me they would not be and I would be dealing direct with the landlord.

They have a responsibility to their clients (landlords) to ensure they get good tenants. People in your situation are (on the whole) going to be a bigger risk than a normal employed person, so why would they expose their client (which in turn exposes their reputation) to a bigger risk than required?

You'll find that almost all letting agents will require a regular income *or* a guarantor, it's just how it is and has nothing to do with you refusing to pay the fees -- although of course with no fees they wouldn't rent to you, but the roadblock here is your lack of a guarantor. Some private landlords will accept you, because they might consider you *as a person* (letting agents don't need to do that, why bother, there's always new tenants to rent to) and trust you, but they're taking a bigger risk that they should.",null,0,null,1422288336,null,0,false,0,co1c4vf,null,t3_2tpwh4,null,t1_co1c4vf,null,t1_co1bsaj,null,null,null,1424382228,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

4.36 - is talking about employment levels, not wages.  Let's stick to one argument for now (and if you want to go there please try to explain our record low unemployment).

4.9 'The majority of studies found that migrants reduced wages at the bottom'.  Correct!  now, get your calculator out and figure out what the impact is!!   As I have said very clearly above it is **negligible**.  *In the neighbourhood of £5 a month*.  

4.10 - 'an increase of 10k migrants decreased avg wages by approx. £1 per year' - again negligible

4.11 Impacts specifically to Semi/unskilled (£8 per year), skilled (£15 a year), Personal Services (£25 a year).   Yep, still negligible.

So, EU Immigrants have negligible impact to wages at low end (and you conveniently ignore they help middle/higher earners which is odd).  

I find this argument particularly hypocritical it must be said.  If you are so worried about low-wage earners then you should be looking to support a party that will increase min wage or/and support a living wage rather than a party looking for a scapegoat and ignoring the facts.",null,0,null,1422289410,null,0,false,0,co1cqcu,null,t3_2tc96w,null,t1_co1cqcu,null,t1_co1bi6v,null,null,null,1424381950,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Sort of the same reason we sold Mata and rolled with Oscar. Mata's a brilliant footballer at what he does, but our system required a CAM that would press significantly more. 

That said, I absolutely love Schürrle's attitude and his buying in to the system, and hope he wants to stick around and strive to improve. I do wonder if his directness is part of the reason why he's not seeing as much time on the pitch this year, though. We still love to counter, but we're holding possession and picking passes a lot more this year, and Schürrle's directness thins out the formation somewhat.

null,false,Reborno,null,null,null,"Cesc Fabregas has admitted he never would have dreamed of playing for Jose Mourinho three years ago when the two were arch-enemies in Spain.

The Chelsea midfielder now says he’s happier than ever playing for the former Real Madrid manager, compares him with Pep Guardiola, and says he is desperate to win the European Cup with him.

Asked in an interview in El Pais in Spain if he could ever have imagined working for Mourinho he says: ‘Three years ago no. It just shows you how you can never tell in life, and even more so in football. We had a very intense rivalry with Mourinho. It never reached the level of hatred, not even close, but there were disagreements with him and [John] Terry too. Chelsea were always the team that I most wanted to beat.’

Asked how Terry received Fabregas into the dressing room when he joined last summer the Spain international said: ‘He told me that anything I needed I could count on him. 

'We have now reached the stage where we can tell the tales of some of the battles we had to some of the younger players, and I certainly had some battles, especially with Terry and [Frank] Lampard.’

Fabregas was a London rival for both Terry and Mourinho when he signed for Arsenal from Barcelona. He then took the rivalry with Mourinho back to Spain with him when he returned to play for his boyhood team and the Chelsea manager took over at Real Madrid.

Having worked for both Mourinho and Pep Guardiola he says they are not as unlike as they are often portrayed.

‘They have one very important thing that unites them’ he said. ‘They are winners. They both hate losing. It's a mistake to think they are so different.’

Fabregas believes the similarities are even on the increase now that Chelsea have started playing a style of football closer to that played by Guardiola. He said: ‘This is not a team that sits and waits for the other side to attack. We want the ball and we want to attack.’

The Chelsea midfielder is hoping to win his first Champions League with Chelsea after losing the Paris final with Arsenal in 2006 and failing to lift the trophy for Barcelona.

He said: ‘I would like to win it at least once. At the same time I don’t want it to become an obsession. I want to win everything with Chelsea.’

Fabregas again dismissed the idea that he had any sway in making Leo Messi turn his back on Barcelona to move to London and he said he believes, in Eden Hazard Chelsea have a player who can reach the heights of the Argentine.

He said: ‘There are even physical comparisons with the way he is short, strong and impossible to knock off the ball. He is honest, he never goes to ground, he always wants the ball, he doesn’t over-elaborate for the sake of show and he is just a very, very good player. He has the quality to go very far but he should maybe more ambitious when he’s in front of goal.’

For now it’s Fabregas that is scoring the lion’s share of goals from midfield despite playing in a deeper role for Chelsea than he did at Barcelona.

Many universities have been left considerably worse off than they were pre-rise, but at the same time students expect to get much more from them on account of the increased cost.

It's all very well putting the fees down but, if they don't match the shortfall, all they are doing is taking more money away from higher education. 

Another problem would be that applications would be likely to drop off initially as students would try and hold out for a further decrease.

Honestly, some of the Q's are a lil unclear. Like the emotions popping up twice for a section.  Also, might just be me but most of the emotions were irrelevant.

Not at all/Very slightly - Shouldn't really have this as a single scale point. It's good to be able to distinguish a Zero value from a very low value in the data.

I think there could be better ways of asking for the information, unless your specifically after the emotional responses.

Also the Q about 'British', should probably refer to them as 'The British',  but also seeing as you're on the Northern Ireland forums where nationality is a touchy subject, you maybe should have opened that Q up to be 'The British and Irish'.   Yes NI is part of Britain but people can claim dual nationality.  Small things like this can distract people and increase the dropout rate. I've had email complaints from respondents about similar things. ie. What part of UK? Answer F = Ireland.

I explain that I am not prepared to pay £350 because I didn't feel I had £350 worth of services from them and **I explained again that a guarantor was not possible** and even if it was I wouldn't do it.

They would of course refuse his application if he refused to pay the fees, but it seems quite clear that they **require a guarantor** and the OP is **refusing to provide a guarantor**. The fee comes *after* you meet the requirements, so the logical conclusion here is that they are refusing him *because he doesn't meet their requirements*. If he doesn't meet the requirements why does the fee even matter? Remove every mention of the fee from the OPs post and the result is the same: ergo, they are not refusing on the grounds he won't pay the fee.

If I apply for a property that is £10,000 per month rent and I can only afford £5,000 per month and I say ""I would like to rent this property but I won't pay your fees, also I can only afford £5,000 per month"" and they refuse to rent it to me, are they rejecting me because I won't pay their fees or because I don't meet their requirements?

That's a fair point, though unfortunately it's likely that someone in that position will never work again. Due to globalisation and advances in technology, unskilled work is in decline and it's not coming back. So unless your 50 year old has an active, agile mind and is up for retraining, it's likely to be game over. IMO we need to plan for much more large scale unemployment.

They've made assumptions about demand reduction based on behavioural change, which is something that has never worked in any other sphere). There is also a reliance on interconnectivity to lower demand for Gas, which implies that we don't really care how the electricity is generated elsewhere so long as WE aren't using carbon... which seems odd to me. 

All that said - that's just a first glance at the report, I'll read the whole thing later. 

I agree that technological progress means we may be able to meet more and more of our needs through renewables, and I welcome that... but there's a large risk-factor here, in that it can't yet. So do you stop working on the things which assure our future needs are met in the hope that renewables become good enough at low enough cost and - most importantly - we can develop cost-effective storage in the next 10-15 years? I would argue not. The risks simply outweigh the potential benefits. 

We've made huge strides in storage in some places (some of the heat strores they're using in Nevada are amazing), but they're not really suitable for our climate yet. When we have storage technology so our base loads and peak loads can be met without risk and it can all be charged by renewables I'm right there with you... but we don't yet have the capability, and I don't think we should gamble on something so vitally important. 

I love that David King is supportive, but even he accepts that the technology doesn't yet exist.

As to GM - I believe it's the animal feed supply chain which would be hardest hit, but I was reading about it down at Dad's over xmas in the middle of nowhere and his wife gets the countryside magazines, couldn't begin to tell you which one, just remember it as an interesting article looking at the topic from a perspective I haven't considered before. I share the concerns over the privatisation of food supply, and companies like Nestle saying there's no such thing as a human right to water is genuinely terrifying... 

The econ stuff was maddening. To give just one example - pension contributions aren't taxed because pensions are taxed, so proposing to tax pension contributions AND pension receipts means taxing someone twice on the same income. Even ignoring the unfairness of it, the day that law passes nobody with half-a-clue is going to save in a pension scheme any more, they'll just shift their savings directly to other funds/schemes so that £20bn ""saving"" doesn't actually exist... which leaves rather a large hole in the £100bn spending plan.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"About 12 years ago Microsoft were on a big push to migrate Visual Basic / .NET to ""browser capable"" and ""run anywhere"".

Microsoft were late to the game, so they sold this development environment where apps that were built using a Windows desktop IDE &amp; methodology could be hosted on Windows Server and run in Internet Explorer.

This gave desktop developers a familiar development environment and also loads of really sweet widgets and stuff - fewer sacrifices had to be made to the web medium, they could just continue writing desktop apps, but these ran ""in browser"" and so they could sell the advantages of webapps to corporate and government buyers.

I remember questioning vendors about this at the time, and their response was that their customers didn't care. They didn't share my concerns because Internet Explorer was what was installed on all the corporate computers, thousands and thousands of them in many organisations, and they didn't care about compatibility with other browsers.

This was the IE6 era, when IE had a 95% market share, and before Firefox was yet to make its mark. Microsoft had beaten Netscape Navigator and they rested in their laurels. IE6 languished for 5 years, and then when IE7 was finally released - *oh, whups!* - these IE6-only .NET widgets had been dropped and were no longer supported.

This is why IE6 loitered around so long on corporate desktops, and remains difficult to get rid of today. In terms of business-critical deployments 10 or 12 years is nothing, so I would imagine a lot of these systems remain in use. Many of the vendors who supplied them will have gone bust or moved on.

The membership point is valid, since I think think many terrorist groups have actual membership systems. But I'm still not convinced that this approach is constructive. These groups are diametrically opposed to the cultural norms and standards we expect from members of our society, and I do think there is a point where being accepting of different standards is just detrimental. Especially when spreading ideology associated with groups like ISIS is actively harmful. 

So while I get the point she is trying to make, I think it does need to be tempered by the realities of these groups. Being overly accepting of different groups is a problem.

There's an argument which suggests that as soon as the Greens go all-out to win all the left-leaning seats they can, they'll have betrayed the princples that got them this far. (Just like, I suppose, if UKIP go so mainstream as to pick up a lot of MPs and have mass appeal, they will have betrayed *their* principles-- even though I don't much like those principles).

The distribution of keys is not a serious problem I think, as we use the electoral register and registered voter cards already for this problem.  Each one has a unique number, that could just as easily be a key.

I'm actually pretty suspicious of the current voting system anyway, as when you turn up at the polling station they give you a numbered ballot, and they write that number and your voter number on a separate sheet.  That means it would be trivial to find anyone's vote if you wanted.

Blockchains have the potential for improving things -- we could actually do some sort of diffie-hellman system for key exchange (or something even cleverer, that some clever cryptographer would already have an algorithm for that let you make up a key in partnership with a central authority, but that authority doesn't know your key).

As for the one-vote; one-transaction.  I think the blockchain has that one covered.  If you dished out, for example, one indivisible unit of ""vote token"" to every single voter, then you ""vote"" by ""paying"" that token to a particular target address, then that's one-vote-per-customer covered.

Call it Occam's legal razor, if you like: Make the minimum number of laws that you need to, restrict the minimum of actions and permit everything else. That seems to me to be a fairly good starting principle.

So it's not so much that I think it should be a ""protected action"" but that I think it shouldn't be a ""restricted action""-- it's an action that needn't *itself* be a crime. And the onus is on those who would restrict it to demonstrate that this is something that is absolutely necessary.

Letting agent 1 = 5% management fee, £180 'reference' fee. 

Letting agent 2 = 4% management fee, £250 'reference' fee. 

Letting agent 3 = 3% management fee, £320 'reference' fee. 


Now as a landlord, which would you pick? The 3% one, obviously. And that bones the tenant. The tenant can't shop around letting agents for the best reference fee.. If they want your property then they'll have to play by the letting agents rules. They have the monopoly on that property. 

New system:

Letting agent 1 = 6% management fee

Letting agent 2 = 5% management fee

Letting agent 3 = 4% management fee


By not fobbing off costs to the customer (tenant) the business (landlord) can find a transparent and best rate. It'd also make for more competition between letting agents for attracting Landlord and properties. In the current system if you make your management percent low enough you can attract the most landlords and get a monopoly on certain properties in certain areas. 


Banning letting agency fees would do wonders for the rental market. 

Scotland already did it. Nothing changed other than tenants stopped getting ripped off and maybe a few scummy letting agents got let go. 

The only people that should want to keep the current system are the mentally impaired and the letting agents. ",null,0,null,1422294367,null,0,false,0,co1fpig,null,t3_2tpwh4,null,t1_co1fpig,null,t1_co1fe47,null,null,null,1424380491,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

Even on the same system you can simply have 2 tables - one of voters, and one of votes. When someone votes, you check off that they've voted in the voter table, and tally their vote in the other.

The communications issue is obviously big - we need real and working encryption, not something that can be spied on in mass.

The thing is you can go a lot further than this, though, and actually have it trace-able to who voted for what, but separated physically and in a way that it can't be accessed without multiple authorised people (and hell, why not just make it so the secure login/key of the person who voted is required too - then it can't even be done without your knowledge!)

You can mimic absolutely every way paper voting works with a digital system, and then some.

The issues are still security though - who designs, has access to, oversees, etc. the system.

But all are easy to solve.

*Now* the really issue isn't how to solve the problems. It's how do we ensure that the government actually ensures that digital voting is actually implemented in a way to involves all of the necessary solutions.

*That* is the real risk - if it was left to me to implement the entire thing with whatever budget I required, for example, I know that it could be done with more security than even the way we conduct elections today. But that doesn't mean that that is what will happen.

You are largely at the mercy of the temping agencies, two/three months - don't hear a peep from any of them, and then suddenly there's a flurry of offers, including a four-month role half-way across town that pays ~£7 per hour. Hesitate and they will pass the offer along. Accept, and you find they only needed you to cover for a week or two. This inflexibility and unpredictability made it difficult for me to properly look for real work.

Still, CV gaps can be pretty ugly, especially if they are for a few months, since that will be brought up at future interviews. Oh, and you could try doing some free online courses to plug it even more.

But if you could do without the money for a short time, voluntary work is great, especially if you do something you want to do!

* CVs need to be concise. The following statement is a bit repetitive and the following claim isn't really supported by the evidence: ""...CRM databases by working with CRM software."" 
* ""Worked across a variety of marketing channels including direct mail and email"" =&gt; I read this as 'The only marketing channels I have worked with are direct mail and email'

&gt; A 51% attack is trivial when you have the resources of a nation at your disposal. And while detectable, it'd still ruin the election.

Doesn't matter -- what matters is that the attack would be entirely public and observable after the fact.  Which is all that matters for an election.

Bear in mind that a 51% attack is a double spend attack, not a ""completely rewrite the blockchain"" attack.  A double-spend attack isn't relevant with an election, because at some point we call an ""end"", and whatever the current chain is, that's the truth -- so the person trying to ""double spending"" their vote, still only gets one.  You can't actually ""spend"" on one chain twice -- which is all that would matter for a votechain.

Mata requires extra defensive cover and forces his team to play with more defensive cover behind him or to be weaker defensively.

Oscar is younger, and while maybe not as creative he has a similar ability to score goals but provides more flexibility for a team.  Oscar can interchange both horizontally and verticly in a team and his flexibility allows the team to play more creative less defensive players behind him.  Oscar allows the team to play Cesc in the pivot which would never be possible with Mata in the side.  Oscar also allows for a free flowing rotation between the attacking players without the team losing defensive solidity.

null,false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat,null,"&gt; Is Clegg not ashamed of some of the awful things the Tories have done, in part thanks to his coalition? If he is, then the honourable thing would be to resign.

You have to consider the whole picture, though. The Tories have been able to do a great deal, not all of it bad- and the Lib Dems have accomplished a *lot* in coalition. Given that the most likely alternative in 2010 was a minority Tory govenrment followed by a snap election mid-post-crisis recession, entirely open to a vastly better-funded Tory party waltzing to outright victory, the party could have done significantly worse. 

Clegg has, honestly, been an excellent leader for the party. He hasn't done a perfect job, but what he *has* done is a *good* one. The value of that can't be understated- the party's been through some frightfully arduous times over the past five years, and it's to his credit that it hasn't fallen to pieces mid-coalition. He's honestly the best leader the Lib Dems could have hoped for, given Kennedy's mid-career combustion. 

We've not got everything we'd have preferred to get out of the coalition, by a long shot- the Tuition Fees and AV situations were such all-round screwups that they cast a shadow over everything else the party's managed.

But surely you can see how much easier, for example, buying votes would be. 

Send private key to buyer, buyer casts vote, buyer sends money to voter. Repeat to infinity. Can be done with nothing but a computer and some money to burn. 

The closest thing to that with the current system would be to send your postal ballot off to the buyer, then have them post it. Much more involved. Much harder to pull off. Much less anonymous. 

Then there's also distributing the private keys to worry about. Whoever you get to print the keys and send them off could just make a note of all the keys. 

If someone finds their key doesn't work, it'd be tough shit. No reversing transactions on the block chain.. No proving they didn't vote with their key.. Merely complaining that your key didn't work when you tried to cast your vote could call the security of the keys, and by proxy the security of the election into question.

Multisig with two companies printing one key each? I'm not too clued up on multisig.

It's all getting ridiculously complicated by this point, though. Just go to the booth and tick a piece of paper.

Not really. 

The problem for the Lib Dems isn't Nick Clegg- it's that they're the Lib Dems. Clegg's popularity rating doesn't really affect matters- if anything, although his approval ratings are pretty low (though still above Ed Miliband's), at least people *have heard of him*. 

The possible alternatives are all non-starters at the moment. 

&gt;Or is Clegg more in it for the power, and less for improving the country?

If Clegg wanted ""power"", there are far less stressful ways to get there than heading up the Liberal Democrats in 2015. The man's there because he's doing a good job, and because it's a job that nobody of consequence wants to take from him. 

If he can manage to lead the party into another coalition, he'll be applauded. If he can't, he'll do the decent thing and step down. *That* is when leadership contenders will pounce. 

Right now, it's an utterly thankless task. Nobody else wants the job, and there are precious few people out there in a position to take over that could do it halfway as well as Clegg is right now.

It does become a fine line between expressing an opinion and inciting. 

As far as I'm concerned saying ""gay people are not human"" is fine. I mean it isn't, its disgusting. But you should be able to say it. 

When you say ""they must be punished"", well if you want to be an activist and campaign legally that you want it criminalised. Letter writing campaigns to your MP etc. then that is fine.

To me that reeks of unnecessary shit stirring.

There is no doubt that Jose plays the politics of football very very well, but to suggest that his"" self-self-absorbtion"" is so great that he is having a ""love in"" with Liverpool is red rag reductionism. 

Whilst, I don't necessarily agree whit Chidgey, I've listened to the Chelsea Fancast for years, and Chidgey and the rest on the show truly love the club and are a proper supporters who keep the club's relationship with the supporters in check. 

I really think the problem is the club just refuses to acknowledge the voices of its loyal supporters both at home and abroad, and is more interested in securing the commercial revenue. Which to be fair I understand.

As of now, Chelsea sells the home game tickets based on loyalty points, i.e. the more you attend games, the more likely you are to attend the next game. Obviously, to encourage people to attend ""less important"" games (home and away), they give more loyalty points for those said games (and they are usually cheaper: CL group stage are £35, League Cup and FA Cup are £25/£35 and Category B home matches (Burnley, Leicester, Hull City, Stoke, Southampton, Sunderland, Swansea, West Brom) are £47).

So in order to attend the good games, people need to go to away games (for which the price of the ticket will be unchanged) and go to the ""less important"" games (that are already cheaper), which means that cutting down the price by 20-25% will only help people that are already going to games on a regular basis.

null,false,TheSquareMileVampire,null,null,null,"This isn't the sub to discuss it but I will tell you what happens with Greece.

The majority of Greece's debt is held by their own banks and the ECB. The total amount of which is not actually that big and the contagion from a default would not be that dramatic (in 2012 it was a far bigger problem). There are some hedge funds who own their debt as well but that's their problem and they knew the risks they were taking. No one gives a shit if they go under anyway.

Where things get complicated is that you have far left groups in Portugal and Spain in particular who are watching to see the treatment that Greece gets. The leader of the Spanish one was actually at Tsipras' celebration speech.

If Spain and/or Portugal go the way of Greece and refuse to commit to austerity then we have a huge problem. Like one that could lead to Europe wide recession for a very long time. The Germans would almost certainly say fuck it and leave themselves if someone like Spain elected a group like Syriza.

For this reason the ECB and troika cannot be seen as going easy on Greece. If they do then the leftists almost certainly win in Spain later this year.

It might actually be best for the rest of the EU if Greece gets kicked out. It would cut a malfunctioning part of the European puzzle straight out and would send a clear message to the other leftist parties. This would of course set the poor Greeks back a decade if not longer. But hey, they were the ones who elected Syriza.

Their banks are already seeing a run on them for which their asking the ECB for emergency funding to meet. It's not good.

The other option is that Syriza backs down or accepts some small concessions but it seems unlikely the Germans go for that at this point in time.",null,0,null,1422300573,null,0,false,0,co1jlyk,null,t3_2tqaec,null,t1_co1jlyk,null,t1_co1j9nd,null,null,null,1424378672,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I currently rent and you are looking from around £600 per month and up for a small one bedroom place. If you a very lucky, you can find something for less (I did!) but need to keep watching the house market! 

There are tons of amazing places to eat and drink in Canterbury so I really don't think it will be hard to find a job in the food industry. If that doesn't work out, there are also lots of businesses that hire regularly, quite a few business parks and good transport links to other towns.
[Here](http://www.indeed.co.uk/jobs?q=Chef&amp;l=Canterbury)
is a good site to use to look for current positions in restaurants. 

You can get a flat in town close to all the restaurants, like my flat, but trust me it gets really loud and really ugly- people regularly use our road as a toilet after a night out. Further out of the city is more peaceful, and its a small enough place to walk everywhere relatively quickly.

It's a shame, i'm moving out of my flat in the beginning of March which I bet will be too late for you though it's a really lovely property. Be aware that most buildings are very old and with that comes issues like damp and mould. Canterbury is a pretty friendly city and possibly one of the nicest areas in Kent, you should fit in fine! Your nerves are totally understandable though. If you and your girlfriend ever want to socialise, the people on this subreddit seem a very sociable bunch and there are a lot of great pubs to visit!

Your taxes will first be split up into ""general taxation"" and ""NHS fund"" contributions, and everyone will pay them, and the amount you'll pay will remain about the same. In fact it might even be that the well off pay a little bit more to start with.

This will be introduced as some kind of scheme to reduce bureaucracy - to interface HMRC with the new NHS billing database, for example. It'll be heralded as keeping your payments just the same, but the move will allow ~~immigrants~~ *tourists, foreign students on visas and non-British nationals* to be billed for their NHS treatment, which can of course be paid for by their insurance companies.

It'll obviously be mandatory for visitors to have insurance before they come here, even if they're on 5 year working visas and paying taxes.

It's only once the ""NHS fund"" contributions have been split from general taxation, and we've all become accustomed to that over a period of some years, that people will be offered the chance to transfer their NHS contributions to a private insurance scheme instead. By that time the NHS will be overburdened, anyway, and anyone who's earning a decent wage will be glad to pay for something better. Pretty soon we'll be seeing news stories of poor NHS treatment and people will say ""well, it's their own fault, they should have paid a little bit more for a better quality of health insurance, just like I did"".

The abolition of free healthcare will not occur simply overnight - it will be a decades long process to acclimatise the electorate (in the face of the overwhelming burden we face from an ageing population [who've taken out more than they've put in](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8384449/NIESR-Taxes-must-rise-by-90bn-a-year-to-fund-baby-boomers.html)) to the increasing cost of decent healthcare.

We've already started down this road, IMO, as our politicians are already using loaded language to shift the narrative. We used to have free healthcare in this country, it's only in the last few years I've head this phrase ""free at the point of use"" - won't it still be ""free at the point of use"" if they send you a £20,000 bill once you get home? Won't it still be ""free at the point of use"" if you're just simply legally required to have insurance?

The problem with the British is that we're too complacent, and too respectful of the rule of law and the notion of democracy. When the government stitches us up we just accept it, and there are all these apologists on here saying ""well, you had a vote, the same as the rest us"".

We all know that successive chancellors bribe pensioners with monetary kickbacks, because we know OAPs turn out and vote at twice the rate of twenty-somethings, and we just fucking accept it. The government will give us just enough to keep us quiet and happy, all the time they and their rich friends are squirrelling away their investments offshore.

That's the beauty of anonymity on the internet. You don't have to identify unless you want to. There have *always* been parts of the web you don't want to go on - and aren't even welcome on. There are plenty of places that I, a white, middle-class internet denizen, don't want to go on the internet.

The other major parties policies are fairly coherent and do work together (although a lot of that may come from maintaining the status quo). But the combination of everything to do with Green Party's defence policy looks like a travesty.

Credit institutions make their own judgements about whether or not you're a worthy borrower, making use of the various factors, they don't care about some score Noddle gives you. Noddle clearly value open accounts quite heavily (if closing an account is enough to drop 50+ points from your score) but that's no reason to believe that a mortgage provider is going to even care one iota that you don't have that account open any more.

If Noddle did drop your score because you closed that account it is not going to go back up immediately, you'll need more positive things for it to go up. You weren't penalised for closing the account: you have lost the benefits of having an open account.

For what it's worth in my experience Noddle scores (although I don't pay, so just the x/5) are worth even less than Experians scores, I've seen the scores of multiple people (mine, my family members) and the scores are completely worthless reflections on our financial situations.

You have independent electoral bodies that oversee the whole thing, aren't tied to any party, and are accountable.

Hell, you could even run the whole system independently in each district and have a representative for each one who reports the tallies at the end of it all. Like I said, you can mimic whatever you like from the current system, and you can make it more secure. You can end up with *less* fraud than you currently get with postal voting.

You're acting as though we have some perfect fraud-free system when we don't - and we can actually solve some of the issues with that, too.

And yes, the actual underlying problem to solve is engagement - you might not realise it but marking boxes on pieces of paper is just going to engage less and less people as time goes on. Our democracy is already one of the least democratic in the west due to our outdated system, and low voter turnout will simply damage it further.

You are talking as if having electronic voting could potentially undermine democracy - but what we have is a disengaged public who are so badly represented in government that we *already* have a seriously undermined democracy to start with.

So hey, let's put it this way - a slightly corrupt digital electoral system where someone can shift the polls by 1 or 2 percent (if you do any more than that it becomes too obvious based on independent polls like exit polls, and polls of polls) is way better than one where no one votes.

at least in the american system, recent evidence suggests about transparency, when it comes to congress voting and passing bills etc, it is counter intuitive. special interest and corporate powers can use the information of knowing who votes and how they vote to their benefit, through manipulation and pressures, a lot more efficiently than the public can ever hope to. turns out we may need to trust the people we vote for to do their job, but neither they nor us should have to trust anyone with our actual votes. democracy needs this anonymity.

even the British system, which embarrassingly i don't know as well as i should, but from what i'm reading seems to be at risk of the same thing. individuals are pretty much forced to tow the party line which can't be good for representation:

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom#Procedure)

*When the debate concludes, or when the Closure is invoked, the motion in question is put to a vote. The House first votes by voice vote; the Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and Members respond either ""Aye"" (in favour of the motion) or ""No"" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his or her assessment is challenged by any Member or the voice vote is unclear, a recorded vote known as a division follows. The presiding officer, if he or she believes that the result of the voice vote is clear, may reject the challenge. When a division occurs, members enter one of two lobbies (the ""Aye"" lobby or the ""No"" lobby) on either side of the Chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. A member who wishes to pointedly abstain from a vote may do so by entering both lobbies, casting one vote for and one against. At each lobby are two tellers (themselves Members of the House) who count the votes of the members.*

*Once the division concludes, the tellers provide the results to the presiding officer, who then announces them to the House. If there is an equality of votes, the Speaker or Deputy Speaker has a casting vote. Traditionally, this casting vote is exercised to allow further debate, if this is possible, or otherwise to avoid a decision being taken without a majority (e.g. voting No to a motion or the third reading of a bill). Ties rarely occur—the last one was in July 1993. The quorum of the House of Commons is 40 members for any vote, including the Speaker and four tellers. If fewer than 40 members have participated, the division is invalid.*

*Formerly, if a Member sought to raise a point of order during a division, suggesting that some of the rules governing parliamentary procedure are violated, he was required to wear a hat, thereby signalling that he was not engaging in debate. Collapsible top hats were kept in the Chamber just for this purpose. This custom was discontinued in 1998.*

*The outcome of most votes is largely known beforehand, since political parties normally instruct members on how to vote.* ***A party normally entrusts some members of parliament, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that all party members vote as desired. Members of Parliament do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do so jeopardise promotion, or may be deselected as party candidates for future elections. Ministers, junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries who vote against the whips' instructions usually resign. Thus, the independence of members of parliament tends to be low***, *although ""backbench rebellions"" by members discontent with their party's policies do occur. A member is also traditionally allowed some leeway if the particular interests of his constituency are adversely affected. In some circumstances, however, parties announce ""free votes"", allowing members to vote as they please. Votes relating to issues of conscience such as abortion and capital punishment are typically free votes.*

*Pairing is an arrangement where a Member from one party agrees with a Member of another party not to vote in a particular division, allowing both MPs the opportunity not to attend.[9][10]*

*A bisque is permission from the Whips given to a Member to miss a vote or debate in the House to attend to constituency business or other matters.[11]*",null,0,null,1422303141,null,0,1422308743,0,co1l983,null,t3_2tpol8,null,t1_co1l983,null,t1_co1jtx4,null,null,null,1424377904,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

They will ruin everyone except the lowest 5%, who everyone will be made equal to.

Some more ways they plan to afford all their wonderful plans

Raise taxation from its current very low level of only 36% of GDP

introduce a much-needed increase in environmental taxation

Abolishing tax relief on pension contributions raises £20 billion, and a further £19 billion would come from abolishing employer national insurance contributions and employee

The final £1 billion will come from increased income tax receipts from pensioners. Because the number of pensioners is gradually rising, and we would link the pension level to average earnings

Robin Hood Tax – a tax on financial transactions
by introducing a tax on sterling foreign exchange transactions
a special tax on bankers’ bonuses

(o one in one of the wholly or partly state-owned banks should get a bonus of more than £25,000. -kek)

Introduce the new higher rate of income tax at 50% for incomes above £100,000

Abolish the upper limit for National Insurance contributions, r

Increase the main rate of Corporation Tax from 28% back to 30%

Raise the Capital Gains Tax rate from 18% to the recipient’s highest income tax rate (that is 22%, 40% or 50%

Reform inheritance tax, so that the level of taxation depends on the wealth of the recipient rather than that of the deceased

Crack down on tax havens and other methods of tax evasion and avoidance, raising £10bn

Reform Council Tax by making people in more expensive houses pay more and those in smaller ones less, adding an additional band at the top for the biggest houses, raising £1.7bn. In the long run we favour moving to a system of Land Value Tax, where the level of taxation depends on the rental value of the land concerned.

Modify the regime for Corporation Tax Capital allowances so that the allowances are only available for investment in sustainable technologies, r

ntroduce VAT and fuel duty on aviation,

Increase the rates for the Climate Change Levy and for Landfill Tax

End the zero-rating of VAT on new dwellings,

• Tax plastic bags and other unnecessary packaging

Levy eco-taxes on non-renewables or pollutants, in particular pesticides, organochlorines, nitrogen and artificial fertilisers and phosphates

Introduce new taxes on use of water by businesses and waste heat from power stations,

Armed Forces - Reducing the size of the armed forces and getting rid of trident - so far, so standard.

Like he says, the arms field moves incredibly quickly and our forces equipment will rapidly end up as being obsolete.

Stop spreading this. It's simply misinformation. It comes from the fact that America provided weaponry and support to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan during the Russian invasion into the country. The Mujahideen were an Islamic group but they weren't hostile to America. After the Mujahideen won against the soviets they split up into a lot of smaller groups and there was a civil war where the most extreme group won out. It became the Taliban. They seized all the modern weaponry that had been distributed to American friendly Mujahideen and became a powerful force that the country couldn't stand up against.

People make it sound as if America simply supported the Taliban. No, the truth is America did the right thing, regardless of the motivation for helping the Mujahideen, the Russian invasion was extremely devastating and oppressive. The problem is that America only did the right up until Russia was defeated. They didn't 'clean up' after themselves and ensure that the country fell into the right hands. They simply seemed to lose interest, aside from a too few people within the US' government that weren't enough to stop the country falling into the hands of the taliban.

null,false,UncleArthur,null,null,null,"Thanks for that. However, my questions remain:

- I will find my Income Tax increased by £2k pa.
- This will pay for a benefit which costs little more than the current rate of JSA.
- Thus, the average worker (and let's be honest, they earn more than £3,768 pa) will not be better off in the slightest. They will be worse off.

Unless I have misunderstood - and the explanations I have received have not enlightened me - such a claim is a downright lie. By all means have a policy. Just don't lie about it.

I also have a question or two from the policy list you provided:

&gt;""..a further £19 billion would come from abolishing employer national insurance contributions and employee""

Okay... Why? It's just another form of Income Tax, that the Greens want to increase. I'm sure there's a good reason...
**Edit:** Also, and obviously, abolishing NIC will not raise any money at all.

&gt;""Abolish the upper limit for National Insurance contributions,""

Um. Hang on. Didn't you just abolish that..?

&gt;""The final £1 billion will come from increased income tax receipts from pensioners. Because the number of pensioners is gradually rising, and we would link the pension level to average earnings""

Um, the State Pension is already covered by the triple lock. Unless you plan to massively increase the State Pension to the level of average wages. In which case, good luck funding *that*! According to The Guardian, £159bn is spent on benefits, the majority on pensions. Increasing the State Pension from ~£115pw to ~£385pw (assuming average wages of £20k pa) is not going to be cheap. Let's find another £400bn from somewhere, eh?

Some - actually many - of those policy ideas have genuine merit. Some are so incredibly naive that I'm sitting here, stunned, that someone could write them down without laughing.

You could say (not my personal opinion) that pensioners had 45 years to save for their retirement, and they had the opportunity to have a comfortable retirement (probably a lot better than what my generation is going to have). It is a problem that a lot of people do not start saving until it is too late.

If a pensioner has paid in, they likely had the opportunity to save for their retirement. The problem is some did not save to have a comfortable retirement, or did not earn enough in their working years. I imagine by the age of retirement or at least a few years in, pensioners will have received more than they have paid in. There are unemployed people out there struggling to feed themselves and their families, and employed people for that matter. How in any way are they less valid than pensioners. Is it more important for a child to have a stable, healthy living environment or a pensioner to get fuel allowance (something which a lot of pensioners don't even spend on fuel)?

Obviously there are pensioners in poverty, which is clearly a terrible thing, but no one deserves to be in poverty more than anyone else. Just because they are pensioners does not make the two uncomparable. Pensioners can die fron the cold, but I imagine young children are also vulnerable.

Wow it's amazing how such bullshit gets spread when the idea doesn't stand up any of the evidence of what we actually know about just them as a group, let alone the history of the driving desire for a caliphate within Islam that predates the American revolution.

I'll keep this simple though. Why is it that ISIS have declared the warrant for the genocide of all Hindus then for example? All Hindus should be massacred because of American imperialism? What about the warrant ISIS offer for the genocide of all Shia Muslims? All Christians? All non-believers? All polytheists? All Jews?

It's contemptible to say that the fundamental source of this racist, bigoted, fascistic, and genocidal ideology is the fault of America. America is by no means innocent, and if, as a nation they hope to retain any integrity whilst making a claim to be moral leaders in the world, they should start by prosecuting their own war criminals such as Henry Kissinger instead of venerating them as great statesmen. 

No, if America is the cause of this extreme ideology then you should be able to point to another example of a people who have suffered as a result of American influence in whichever way, and show how they are comparable to groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and show that they share, or shared a similar level of support.

These people rightly react negatively to other redditors when they're all tarred with the same brush, brought on by the party they belong to.

As for mass murder, terrorism and ISIS... ISIS want to establish an Islamic state. As is so often thrown around, the Qu'ran is the source of the ideology that non-believers must die. So really the 'club' we're being told to fight against isn't so much ISIS, but Islam. Should we criminalise Islam and punish Muslims for being members?

Back to actual ISIS themselves. They want to establish a state. The last time a religious group wanted to establish a state was back in the 40's, and another religious group in the region didn't take too kindly to that new state. The result has been constant war ever since. That's what happens when the existence of a state is forced upon someone.

Not all benefits will be replaced, importantly housing benefit will remain, so people will have enough to cover housing costs, basic income will be on top of this.

Have you ever actually even read a word of ISIS's *own* public statements?

The list is more extensive than that even but just in what I've mention includes at least 3 billion people. Actually probably closer to 4 billion.

They justify the rape of women. They even justify the support the rape of children. Additionally they cite the Koran in justifying the establishment of a new slave trade.

This is *their own words*. Their *own* public statements. Yes I'm glad the Kurds are killing them, and I hope they succeed in killing every single person who would use violence to support this disgusting ideology, because it's very clear that it is an ideology that is completely incompatible with, not just our culture, but literally every other culture on earth. They claim that they have the total solution to all ills in their one way of life, and you either accept it or die. There is no reconciliation or compromise possible with this ideology. The ideology claims this is a divinely revealed truth, which by it's very fundamental nature is totally unchallengeable, and they claim to know that God is on their side. 

There has never been an ideology as totalitarian or extreme in human history as that of ISIS'.

If you can point to one bit of evidence that demonstrates that the Kurds are as murderous or immoral as this then you might have a point.

I have posted a comment elsewhere, because I think the concept of a Basic Income is a good one, but the methodology proposed is - IMO - silly. Getting rid of the Personal Allowance will cost every taxpayer earning £10k and more £2,000 in Income Tax. To then be given back £3,768 funded through taxation is a waste of time. The money isn't needed by people who are working; and reducing the Personal Allowance regressively impacts the lower paid.

By all means raise taxation to provide a decent safety net and call it a Basic Income if you want. Personally, I would suggest leaving the Personal Allowance alone. It already erodes to Nil if someone has gross income from all sources over £100k (on a £1 for £2 basis, so someone on £120k gets no PA), and that threshold could be reduced if necessary.

I can't see why there's such a furore about funding this. As I mentioned earlier, the proposed BI is little more than the current JSA, which it would, in part, be replacing. Has someone done their sums correctly? It shouldn't cost extra billions.

Forgive me, but I have been teaching Taxation and Trusts for the last 20 years, and have had to re-work all my case study calculations each Tax Year, as the syllabus was updated from the previous Budget. I have seen the Law of Unintended Consequences hit home year after year, as Chancellors of all colours haven't thought through their proposals correctly. I have a personal league table of the best and worst of them! What we actually need is a root and branch reform of all the Personal Taxes (there are literally hundreds of exemptions, allowances and reliefs) the complexity of which makes it more expensive to administer and less efficient at raising necessary finance for the State to do its job.

If the Greens could show me a simplified tax mechanism that was progressive, easy to understand, costed to be neutral for the average worker, and fair to those on all incomes, I'd vote for it like a shot.

We put an emphasis on moderation against racist, homophobic content, and keeping discussion civil but robust.

Quite rightly, people would raise concerns about how viable this model is when applied to a political forum. We invite everyone with these concerns to subscribe and observe, and decide for themselves whether our interpretation of the rule is too strict. If it is, you might find a better home in /r/ukpolitics. Personally, I browse both.

null,false,UncleArthur,null,null,null,"&gt;Have you heard of the concept of Negative Income Tax?

Yes, I have. It's similar (-ish) to what Gordon Brown introduced with his Tax Credit system (Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Pension Credit). Its problems, IMO, are:

- GB tried to use it as a political income distribution tool, rather than a minimum income guarantee; and
- To make such a scheme work, you have to Means Test (to check what Savings and Dividend income someone has) or you have to make everyone complete a Tax Return every year. GB went with Means Testing. This meant there were also rules about hours worked, size of families, age of children, NI contributions paid, etc. etc.

The latter point in particular, caused immense confusion, ironically mainly around Pension Credit; which is ironic because most people over the age of 40 had no chance of grasping the complexity of the mathematics. (I struggle to explain it to 30-year-old financial advisers, and laugh at them when they ask me who thought up such a monstrosity.) So many pensioners simply didn't bother. Many of them also had an aversion to 'being on benefits' as well. I have been told that the cost of implementing the PC scheme was higher than the actual amount paid out, and I can believe it!

A true Negative Income Tax has the obvious problem that it may discourage those on earned income close to its level to give up work altogether. ""Why work if I can get almost the same income for free?"" is the obvious question. There isn't an easy answer. ""Moral hazard!"" scream the 'hard-working families' of this country. (The 'layabout families' wouldn't mind, however - whoever they might be.)

It's really hard to say. He looks like he has the skill and the physical attributes but I'm not entirely convinced he has the footballing brain - but that can come with time, look at Leon. Honestly I think the result with Kenji will be that he will leave us within the next year or so and forge a career a league or two below. To break out of a youth team as a striker is incredibly tough.

&gt; is Kingsley going to be able to rid of us of the nightmare that is Tiendelli any time soon?

I'm not convinced I am qualified to answer that question. I don't know the game well enough at this level and I can't compare his defensive ability to Tiendalli when Tiendalli is facing Hazard and Kingsley is facing some kid from QPR.

What I do know, from speaking to people who go to these games more regularly than I, is that Barrow was a level above the rest of the u21 team when he was playing with them - look at his position in the pecking order with that statement in mind when you're considering how many players from this (very good) youth side will make it in the Premier League.",null,0,null,1422309526,null,0,false,0,co1paxz,null,t3_2trji0,null,t1_co1paxz,null,t1_co1oszo,null,null,null,1424375916,null,3,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,3,null

They propose a Negative Income Tax, which is as easily managed as the current income tax. That article is well worth a read.

As to your questions regarding how the Green's proposals will work. 

The idea is that everyone gets enough to put food on the table and pay the gas and electric bill regardless of your status. Your salary starts being taxed at £1, not £10,000. You are always better off in work, even if you do only receive 80% of your gross (assuming you're in the lower bracket, otherwise normal rules apply). 

Now if you lose your £30k a year job, you can still pay the bills and put food on the table (albeit you may have to lose/reduce your tv/internet packages etc, there's never been any accounting for legacy expenses... ask anyone who ever leased a car then lost their job). 

I agree with you that it should taper at an income level (which is why I prefer the negative income tax), and I don't accept the argument that savings of administration costs amount to anything like the money it costs to make it universal otherwise the recent changes to child benefit wouldn't have been carried out to save money.

No, it isn't. You can mitigate certain types of ways of doing it but by definition a vote is asking for a person to submit a choice. You can't possibly know what that choice is before its sent to you so it's impossible to know if the choice has been modified by the billions of lines of code between their fingers and your server.

What you're asking is equivalent of a ballot box that when you slide your paper in goes *""BBZZZZZZT the vote received wasn't your true intention""*

Peoples votes *can* be changed with paper systems but it's a much more labour intense process. You've got to stand near the polling station and rough folk up, even then with anonymous voting you'll never know exactly how well it worked.

If you make that digital it scales infinitely, you can now influence the votes of millions of people whether it's directly intercepting their choice or even by manipulating the environment they are voting from *seconds* before they vote.

I don't like to complain too much because I remember how much worse it can get.  Second would still be a great season in the grand scheme of Man City, so I (and I know plenty of others) find it difficult to really *demand* better.  Alright, it's one thing shaking your head a bit and mumbling ""it's not good enough"", but something else to vocally insist on nothing but victory.  

I don't think I could do it, because in my mind that's what United fans do, but you know what?  They believed not only that they could, but also that they *should* win everything and they made sure the players knew it.

I don't know what I'm saying here.  I'm not necessarily saying that we should be more like United fans, and it winds me up as much as anyone when you get the histrionics after a mildly disappointing result, but I do think we'd scrape a few more results if we were.

These decent-ish transfers don't help though.  Buying pretty good players and hoping they become very good is admirable and all but remember the excitement when we signed Robinho, or Aguero?

&gt;For example, we could set a basic income of £10,000/year by using a cut-off point of £20,000/year, and withdrawal rate of 50%. The basic income supplement would be equal to 50% of the difference between someone’s earnings from work and the £20,000 cut-off point. A person with no earnings would get a basic income of £10,000/year; a person who earned £10,000/year would get a supplementary income of £5,000; a person on £15,000/year would get a supplementary income of £2,500; and a person on £20,000 would get nothing (and begin paying tax on the next pound they earned).

As to the obvious question ""how do you pay for that?"" you really want to get into the numbers, but I would start by adopting the recent OECD recommendations for dealing with multinationals and tax avoidance.

Beyond that there's some ideological choices to be made should they be required.

But you cannot include every factor into every complex issue, you cannot put a camera in front of every event and even the presence of a camera changes how an event can play out. All documentaries are attempting to explain an ideology and make moral positions and judgements in what they include all the time. Sadly quite a few just lie anyway.

It is fundamentally impossible to make a neutral documentary simply due to the limitations of film. If you wanted a purely truthful film with no message of the creator the closest you can get is an actualite, that is a scene of everyday life in a single shot. But even the first one 'lumiere's workers leaving the factory' was staged and had them pushing their workers to hurry up and leave. The first documentary arguable was Nanook of the North, notoriously full of lies and documentary has never gotten much more to what we see as objectively true.

It's fine to enjoy a documentary but film at its core is artifice, if you take a moral message from a film you are simply doing what the film maker intended which is agree with them. It's like a debate with only one side. That side could be right but it isn't a fair debate and you shouldn't base your opinion solely on that.

Anyway,

&gt;He has lost all of his trust in his voters (a very large majority were students)

How many are students? Perhaps students disproportionately supported Lib Dem, although my impression of student politics has always been very Labour. But as a whole students don't tend to vote anyway. I think the image that the Lib Dems had as having ""the student vote"" did them more harm in the end - it amplified the effect of making a promise they should have known they couldn't keep.

But let's put this into perspective. Imagine this. It's 2010. The election campaign was broadly focused on the state of the economy, and particularly the country's ability to borrow at good rates in the context of a European Union of countries who might well have defaulted on their debts. Greece *still* might.

Whether you believe this situation points to austerity or Keynes, one thing it doesn't point to is minority governments, unable to properly manage the country's finances, lowering its credit rating, pushing up the price of borrowing... making the country poorer. Even Labour saw this. The Lib Dems and the Conservatives together could form a fairly large majority - making it easy to pass important Government bills as long as the coalition stuck together. Something a minority government couldn't do. The only alternative was a Lib Dem/Labour coalition - but that was *still* a minority, nothing like the healthy majority of the Coalition today. You could involve more parties, but then we're losing stability, it's less effective than the current Government due to this, and it still involves Gordon Brown, who had been decidedly voted out in that election. Confidence and supply agreements were out of the question - but are more reasonable in a 2015 context of a recovery and more stable Europe. They couldn't have worked in 2010 though, as the *whole point* was not to discourage money coming in.

The Lib Dems had said all along that in the event of a hung parliament, they would seek to form a government with the largest party. A hung parliament was the expected outcome, come election day, and the Conservatives were expected to be the largest party. People knew this. Lib Dem voters knew this. 

Lib Dem members, then, voted in favour of the idea to join form a coalition with the Conservative party in the interest of forming ""strong, stable government"", and to prevent the UK from falling the same way as some other European countries at the time. Something which could have been a reality, though we were never quite as bad.

All of this is much, *much* more important than a technicality about having a very special form of debt with a very special interest scheme, which doesn't affect your credit rating and is in no way comparable to what is commonly understood by the term debt. The new way is more progressive - the headline figure is less important than you seem to think. It's closer to a graduate tax than Labour's system.

That is why calling an election over tuition fees would have been totally, utterly out of proportion. Maybe they should have fought harder over the tuition issue? You might think that - I disagree because the new way is more favourable to students but doesn't make good headlines. That's the problem with the Lib Dems, they're not professional enough. They do good, but they don't make good headlines.",null,0,null,1422313019,null,0,false,0,co1raph,null,t3_2tqph1,null,t1_co1raph,null,t1_co1qbn0,null,null,null,1424374986,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

I was taught surprisingly very little about the United Irishmen in school (irish medium school at that) and there is obviously a lot more written about the American revolution and especially documentaries.

The American revolution was an aristocratic revolution supported by working and middle classes, but the leaders were landowners and slaveowners. The United Irishmen wasn't aristocratic in the same way - Britain wasn't 3000 miles away. Washington and the rest of them only considered themselves ""American"" when things didn't go the way they wanted, before that they had no sweat calling themselves British and even fought for the British during the French and Indian war. Washington himself pretty much started the war. I think thats where the United Irishmen differ big time - they were more opposed to the idea of Britishness and wanted almost complete independence based on ancient concepts of Irishness. The Americans didn't have this to fall back on since they were colonists, so it was more about representation to set their own tax and to expand west which the British had made illegal because of native uprisings (colonists expanded west anyway agaisnt the law).

Lenin is a lot harder to talk about this way, since it was never about representation but absolute power. He was very much middle class but used the idea of the working classes to further his own aims, even if there was some ""good"" in those ideas. I remember reading years ago (took A level history, can't remember the details) about him slapping down other Russian revoluntaries when they sniggered about the Easter Rising because it was an obvious lost cause. Lenin was all about symbolism. The idea of the soviet was purely symbolic. The Americans 125 years ago were less about symbolism and more about taxes.

null,false,hpsauceman,null,null,null,"There is lots of distortions that happen in doc film making (some are just common distortions of all communication)

* Firstly the film maker is not omnipresent and infallible and therefore will have biases in the position they're trying to communicate (even if they approach a topic with the very best intentions).
* Communication in general is far from perfect (look up semiotics). If I say to you 'the French man stood by the tree', the image that is in your mind will likely be a composite of all the french men and trees you have experienced, but these will be different from the french men and trees which I know. In this way the communication slips somewhat - this effect is magnified as the topics become more obtuse and abstract, or who a french man is changes over time.
* Film also has a tendency to hide it's biases. Because it presents something 'as shot' it's easy to take it as concrete truth but it's still been edited into a narrative, some shots discarded and some shots not captured (because there was no camera there). Added to this, the film makers 'hand' is hidden too, unlike in a book which is normally read from the perspective of the author.

So all these things distort the 'truth'. Some people think this means Documentaries (some even say all communication) have no truth value. That because meanings in language (and film language) are not fixed and change over time, they aren't to be trusted. I think this is an extreme position, that only really works as academic theory.

I'm sorry, but this is unlikely to change for a while, especially for older parents. Every time I'm home there's a question about computers or the internet. Filters allow parents to at least have an option, as much of one as the pins on television. Whilst they are fairly easily circumvented, they're not by the majority.

Reddit overestimates kids, VPN's are being suggested as if they're going to become as common as google searches, not every child is that computer literate, *especially* the youngest which is who the restrictions are really there to protect. The 10-13 year olds, rather than the 17-20 year olds, and yes some of them will circumvent it. But they could in theory circumvent most blocks put on them, unless they're physical ones (such as only a family computer). I'm slightly older than the demographic being protected as I'm in my early 20s but despite that a lot of friends barely know what torrenting is, the majority *definitely* wouldn't know what VPN's are, they might've heard about proxies, but nothing more than getting around a schools filter to read FB.

These filters don't need to protect 100% of children to be effective, if they even block 50% or 20% then they're more effective than previously.

My issue is I don't see them even being effective for a minority of young people. I have EEs filter on my phone, and when I use my reddit app, there's no filter at all. No need to know about vpns and proxies. Just an app, that's purpose isn't even to circumvent filters. The way young people communicate, loopholes like this will be accessible to the majority. 

The other big issue, is that the filters don't address what are probably the biggest threats out there - malicious communication, blackmail, grooming, sexual or financial exploitation. The only way to address these is through IT literacy for young people, and their parents. I don't think that encouraging lazy parenting is ever good, and that's what these filters do. They don't make the internet safe, they just blacklist certain data.

You've misunderstood the graph- it's working on percentages of the groups in question. 

The ""students"" group's a much smaller subset of the group on the right- the general population. All that graph shows is that students were marginally more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats than the population at large- but they constitute a tiny fraction of the general population. A 79% vote for the Lib Dems amongst students on a ~40% turnout (way, way overestimating it there) would only translate to a few percent nationwide.

However, depending on your taste you may find that you prefer the show after the head writer/production team change in series 5 in that case try out The Eleventh Hour. The most recent series is series 8 and this also has a shift in tone and new Doctor so you could start at Deep Breath as well. 

Alternately, If you don't mind slight spoilers here is my list of recommended episodes to get a sense of the different versions of the show since 2005: www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2t72dy/episodes_to_watch_suggestion/cnwgn14

Then if you like the rebooted show, ""New Who"" you can go back and check out ""Classic Who"" which ran for a solid 20 years and is all part of the same continuity. 

Having said all that, Rose is specifically designed to be a place to start so give that season a shot first... Just be aware that the only true constant is change and you may like different versions more.

If you're a member of a political party, you actually effectively agree to *give up* some of your freedom of speech. It's voluntary. If you want it back, you leave the party (and expressing it in a way contrary to your position in the party has the same effect - you leave it, possibly on the end of someone's boot).

Likewise, if you work for anyone, you give up your freedom of speech on their hours. This is why you can't, for example, as a tannoy announcer for a rail company, use their public address system as a platform for political opinions.

null,false,Floorfrozon,null,null,null,"Hey OP, I see you're asking about the legality of changing the fuse box yourself. There are a number of ""approved documents"" from the uk building regulations authourity specifically for this. Since we are talking about electrics you'll need to look at part p: http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_AD_P_2013.pdf

I suggest you look at this yourself but I'll give you an overview of the relevant parts for you (mostly pages 12 and 14).

Firstly you'll probably end up installing a consumer unit to replace the fuse box, most of the uk are switching to these now as they don't need fuses and are generally better. If you do decide  thht you want to change the fuse box then **by law** you must inform the local authority about it.

As far as changing the fuse box goes you have two choices:

1. Hire a certified electrician to do it. They will come in and change the unit for you. As they are certified by the local authority to do this work all they need to do is notify the local authority about the work and that will be it. 

2. Try to do it yourself (strongly advised against). If you do this then you will have to call for a local building authority to visit your house and approve the work (visits are very expensive). This will involve them firstly testing and assessing the system in the house and deciding what work you will need to do, and asking about your ability to perform such work. Unless you can prove that you have experience working with electrics (ie. Previous qualifications) then they will **not** let you work on the fuse box.

Another point that you need to think about is that the rest of the electrical system in the house needs to be able to handle the new modern unit. You say the wiring is rather old? A qualified electrician may decide after looking at the electrics in the rest of your house that they would also need to be replaced as well as the consumer unit.

The other 2 methods will leave you missing a few things. Not much more than ""who is this person?"" and the weight of a few things (particularly something that is hopefully happening in series 9). I say it's defeinatly worth doing for those things. Plus, once most people get hooked, the urge to marathon is strong, so it doesn't usually take to long.

Series 5. New Doctor. New showrunner. This is a pretty big split from the past 4 series. You'll miss a lot of great stuff, but if you're looking to catch up quickly, it's not a bad way to go.

There's definitely camping near Loch Morlich, which is a bit to the north-west of the starting point for the Cairngorm/Macdui walk. You can probably find camping spots closer to the cairngorm centre where the walk starts from, but I couldn't say exactly where.

The good thing about Ben Avon is that it does put you close to Braemar, so you can travel slightly lighter with regards to food since you'll have an opportunity to restock, and over the 6 or 7 days, you'll probably be glad of a slightly lighter pack. Plus the opportunity to have a mid-hike pint and proper cooked food isn't ever a bad thing.

The best bit about Glen Tilt are the gorges going up the sides of the valley. Last time I did the walk, we had a very, very leisurely first day heading out from Blairatholl and set up camp, before spending 3 or 4 hours going up these gorges. Lots and lots of fun. 

Overall though, you'll probably get the hardest parts of the expedition out of the way quite early on; as I said, the walk from Braemar heading southwest towards Blairatholl is really easy. Glen Feshie is a nice walk too. Can't remember what route I was doing the last time I passed through it (I suspect it was Aviemore to Ballater the long way around, instead of going through the Lairig Ghru, but I can't remember exactly). 

But yeah, Cairn Toul and the mountains on the western side of the Lairig Ghru are stunning too. The Devil's Point is one of the most striking mountains in the UK, and Braeriach is quite something too. Then there's the Lairig Ghru walk itself which is wonderful, especially on the approach to Aviemore as the forest of Rothiemurcus opens up beneath you with Aviemore nestled in the distance. 

Too much to see in just the one expedition really, and I'm waxing lyrical because I miss the place.

It's about expectation really and demanding to be the best, rather than just being quite chuffed we're near the top and have won some stuff, which is something united fans developed over the last 25 years, and it's the same thing with the CL. I think only time at the top can really create that though. 

I also think it's time for a flagship signing. Someone like Pogba or Reus who everyone wants. It's time to lay down that marker that we are a superpower now. When you look at our history we've never really signed anyone like that And that might be enough to change the mentality in the squad a bit - I get the impression a lot of the core see where we came from and where we are now and think they've accomplished what they came here to do, win the league. 

We need to set a new goal. Win the CL at all costs, or defend the league at all costs, not just a vague 5 trophies in 5 years.

&gt; Interfering with the mail: general.
&gt; (1)A person commits an offence if, without reasonable excuse, he—
&gt; (a)intentionally delays or opens a postal packet in the course of its transmission by post, or
&gt; (b)intentionally opens a mail-bag.

This refers to things like taking a letter out of a post box, or rifling through a mail bag that is in a postal workers van. Note the focus on ""transmission"", once the letter has been delivered this does not apply.

&gt; (3)A person commits an offence if, intending to act to a person’s detriment and without reasonable excuse, he opens a postal packet which he knows or reasonably suspects has been incorrectly delivered to him.

Incorrectly delivered to him refers to examples where a post man puts a letter for 12 Fake Street into the letter box of 13 Fake Street, that's clearly an example of an incorrect delivery. A delivery to John Doe at 12 Fake Street is not an incorrect delivery. People and addresses aren't connected in any legal way, post to 12 Fake Street can be opened by John Smith regardless of the name on the letter -- unless of course you're acting in their detriment. If you, for example, were to take a cheque...

My entire point is people should only be tried for the actual crime, and sending menacing tweets saying you will kill your boss or that you will kill in the name of ISIS are both crimes which will not change.

Turn up looking smart. 2. When you speak address your answers to the judge/bench and not the solicitor who is asking you questions. 3. Always stick to the facts and keep it relevant. 3. if you don't know, say you don't know. Quite a lot of the time solicitors like to play games where they ask you a question that you're not really going to know the answer to. When you start saying things like ""I'm not really sure but I think...."" It makes you sound a lot less credible and they will play that up, big time. Just say ""I'm sorry but I don't know the answer to that question because I didn't see that/hear anything/I don't recall etc."" 

Also it sounds like you'll be going to civil rather than criminal court. That's important because its balance of probabilities. So if the judge deems it more likely than not that the accident happens in the manner you describe then you win. They have to be 51% sure. In criminal court they have to be convinced beyond all reasonable doubt. Any slight niggle can mean you don't have enough evidence in criminal court. So if you exchanged details at the scene, have repair quotes, have had work done to your car and so on then you've got every chance of winning.

Court is really a big game with each side trying to one up each other.

The 8th Doctor, I think, is the deepest of all the Doctor's characters. He begins as the most exuberant romantic, full of wonder of the universe and just bringing joy as he went. But he was just, and had a strong moral compass. If you think about it, how many Doctors would have offered to have saved the Master after just killing his friend?
But as he proceeds with his life, he suffers more loss than any other Doctor. Sure, 9, 10 and 11 were the last of the Time Lords, but I think 8's loss was on a much more personal, and painful, level (8 also saw Gallifrey destroyed, by the way). And you see what happens to him. After the Faction Paradox, the 2nd War in Heaven, spending hundreds of years on a single planet, he still believes he is a good man and he will not fight. He isn't a soldier, despite how much more brutal his actions are (but for headcanon reasons, I like to think he did some fighting, even if he didn't call it that). But he also makes one of the hardest decisions faces by the Doctor. The 4th Doctor wasn't sure if he had the right, the Warrior held the outcome of the Time War , the 9th Doctor had to choose between saving Earth and destroying the Daleks. But 8 had to become a man who was not the Doctor, to cast away that name so that he may bringing the universe from the brink. 
I could also just listen to Paul McGann talk all day and night.

The 9th Doctor is a man scarred. A veteran and survivor, the deaths of his people still weight heavily on his shoulders. Emerging from a side of him not to be called the Doctor, he looks for what he used to be, how he used to be. He looks to become the Doctor again. And that's really what I think his story is about, at least now. He calls himself the Doctor, but he isn't sure if he deserves it. He does some fairly questionable things at the beginning of his life (bringing the anti-plastic to kill the Nestene Conscious, allowing Cassandra to die, torturing a Dalek, launching a missile at the Slitheen etc.). But as he progresses, he finds what he is meant to be and we see who he wants to be, and who he needs to be (his reaction to the death of the space pig, saving everyone from the nanogenes, sacrificing himself to the Reapers, choosing to spare the Earth at the expense of letting the Daleks live). And Rose is integral to that, and their romance is powerful, if quietly done (don't give me that 10 and Rose rubbish, 9 and Rose was the way it was meant to be).
9 is also pretty funny.

TL;DR 8 has most interesting character development, and has the greatest voice. 9 has most significant character development and story, and is pretty funny.

The state is willing to overlook many things the IRA have done over the years in the name of peace. Thats clearly evident by the fact that many IRA members were let off the hook via OTR letters. Drug dealing is a lesser crime in the grand scheme of things when you consider that those other crimes have involved murder for political reason.

If you ever bought any drugs in the 90s and early 2000s then you'll know fine rightly where they come from and who provided them. For me it was mainly cannabis - the IRA supplied it to hoods who would sell it in smaller supply. They took their cut and fuck knows what they did what that cut. Howard Marks had links to the IRA when supplying hash. You'll also know why harder drugs like heroin never took off in republican controlled areas, but did in loyalist controlled areas.; a bias against harder drugs and a willingness to provide softer drugs. 

Theres nothing odd about it. Drug supply is a multi billion £ industry world-wide, if you think the IRA weren't involved in it then you're very naive.

Promoting murdering people is a crime. I have repeatedly said that only people committing no crime should not be punished. Why have you made this point?

Why have you made up my position? It's such a weak debating tactic, why can't you take on what I am saying?

No need to get so touchy that I pointed out you support the introduction of thoughtcrime. It's not an analogy, you literally said this:

&gt;If some person thinks that western society is bad and should be destroyed, that person should loose the right to live in western society

You can get pissy if you want, but you said it, it's there in black and white... backing down on it now just seems pathetic, have courage in your convictions and back up your opinion that people should now be punished for their thoughts.

You are right, making a comparison between two things is no thoughtcrime.

Don't get me wrong, Depay would be a fantastic inclusion to our squad and we'd be very lucky if we did somehow get him over United or anyone else but, tactically, it'd be a slightly confusing move.

I am making the point that you should not let the fear of terror overrule your common sense and rule your life. It is a minimal risk, you are far more likely to die from heart disease. Not making the point that we should do nothing.

&gt;Yeah, maybe we should even let all the people from prisons

Can you explain to me how that makes any sense as an argument against what I said? I would love to counter it, but it just seems like a random thing you made up to make me sound extreme. I never said terrorists shouldn't be punished, did I? So how is this connected?

&gt; I mean what are the chances that it will be you who will be killed right?

Do you allow the constant fear of murder to rule your life? Do you allow government to make major legislative changes which change core aspects of our society in order to control murderers? We introduced a law outlawing murder - but most murders happen domestically, why not surveil everyone at home? We don't do that because we value privacy more than we fear murder.

&gt;That's really stupid outlook of life, would you tell that to people who lost someone in 9/11? In Paris attacks? London? Moscow? ""Just a bad luck guise. It wasn't me tho, so everything is okay""

OK so now we will make laws based on how the families of people who died feel.

What do you say to the families of people who die from bad diet and inactivity? Do we turn to them and tell them we will change laws and make exercise mandatory and ban certain foods? They outnumber the victims of the attacks you mentioned be a huge number. We don't do that because we value our freedom to live our own lives more than we fear dying from our lifestyles.

What about people who die driving? Why aren't we turning to families and telling them we will change laws to reduce all cars to maximum 20mph on all roads to save lives. We don't do that because we value our freedom to drive at 50mph more than we fear the risk of dying.

[From Howard Mark's Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Marks#Drug_empire) it states that the IRA would have executed McCann knew of his other activities.

&gt;As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[27]

 There has only ever been one Republican group involved in actually selling Drugs and that was the tiny splinter group the IPLO, who split from the INLA, there is a possibility that the ORM (Official Republican Movement) another Breakaway group from the OIRA may have had some involvement, but both instances where small scale. 

The British Government used everything at their disposal to discredit the PIRA, Consistently calling them Drug dealers, yet there has never been a significant case brought before the courts in the entire history of the troubles, No Drugs Bust, No mass arrests for Drugs, zip, zilch, zero, nada. Regardless of what every bodies favourite celebrity Drug Dealer Howard Marks says, there is no evidence for it whatsoever. Now the IRA must be some sort of genius criminal masterminds to pull that one off, not a single big drug arrest in forty odd years of activity. Compare that to there other endeavours, 15,000 people yes thats right **15,000** people where arrested and spent time in Jail for IRA activities and guess what, not a single one of them was for drug related crime. That there is a statistical oddity.

Now say you where to look at cigarette smuggling, diesel laundering, conterfeiting that would be a whole other story they seem to be terrible at that;getting themselves arrested all the time. You would think the magical ability to control the drug market unimpeded would be some sort of transferable skill that worked across all illicit trades, but no.

Now for the ONH: same as above except for ten times more touts (they are getting arrested all the time) and even less drug related arrests.

P.S If you where buying Drugs in the 90's and Early 2000's you where buying them off loyalists and the local wee hoods where hardly going to admit that.

Why do you just keep ignoring the points I am making? You are saying you don't understand me, but I make points which you fail to counter in any way, so what am I meant to think?

Are you OK with the possibility that some crazy guy could pick up a knife in a restaurant tomorrow and stab you to death? Well you better be, because that is the cost of living in a free society - we cannot monitor everyone all the time.

There are certain risks we live with as a cost of living free. Surely you accept this indisputable fact? I am simply suggesting terrorism is one of those things.

&gt;Would your opinion changed if there were 10 attacks per year in every major European city? Because that's what would have happened without any security measures.

Where have I at ANY point said there should be no security measures? Why are you making up my argument?

This is incredibly frustrating, you just aren't reading what I am saying. We can still fight terrorism without having to fear it constantly.

&gt;you would just say some stupid shit like ""oh well, how many people will die in a car accident a year?

How can you say this is ""stupid shit""? Do you not understand that we clearly accept some risks as acceptable for our way of life? Your dismissive attitude shows you either can't argue against what I'm saying, or can't justify your own view.

Can you please explain to me how it would make sense to make no changes to privacy laws for things which literally kill millions in Europe every year ([inactivity](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/physical-activity/data-and-statistics/10-key-facts-on-physical-activity-in-the-who-european-region) &amp; [obesity](http://easo.org/obesity-facts-figures)), while we make wholesale changes for something which, even with your 10 attacks, would kill 200? 1,000,000 vs 200.

Don't just dismiss it as insane. Explain why it is insane to compare these two situations? Explain why it is insane to suggest that one kills vastly more and if we give up privacy for the lesser one, how can we not do so for the greater one?

If it's such a stupid argument, tear it apart, change my mind.

But to address your point, in my opinion, the revenues and experience are outweighed by both the proven detrimental impact the Europa League has on the following weekend fixture (due to less time to prepare, less recovery time, and long travelling distances midweek) and also the potential for injuries. I'm not someone who thinks if we miss CL then we're done for the next 5 years since our squad is young and filled with potential. However, CL is still the most lucrative competition to participate and especially to succeed in, *by far*, so it will still be a priority over gaining experience for a season in the Europa league which might be a good introduction to European football for some of our younger players but ultimately CL is a different animal and the best way to prepare for it is to build a strong, deep squad. The way to build a strong deep squad is giving yourself the best chance of Champions League and, as we saw last season, the less distractions the better in that regard.

Foot position on pegs should have the arch/centre of your foot on it. If you have the balls of your feet on the pegs, that's more distance to move them for braking or gear change. It also introduces strain on your lower legs.

I tend to have my right foot close to the brake at an angle and my left foot under the gear lever so i can quickly pre-load and shift without the extra movement.

It mostly comes down to personal comfort.

**edit**

Some have mentioned having balls of feet on pegs keeps the area clear when leaning around a corner. This can be an issue, but it depends how low your bike is, how deep you lean and if you really need to be going in that deep in the first place.

I am by no means an advanced rider, but in general riding around/between cities or along country A-roads, there have been only a handful of instances where i've even thought i might need to move my feet due to a steep lean, and most of those times were going around a roundabout a bit too fast.",null,0,null,1422324108,null,0,1422326112,0,co1xin6,null,t3_2trv9k,null,t1_co1xin6,null,t3_2trv9k,null,null,null,1424372011,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

Sure but that is not what I mean by unsustainable debt. The words have a very specific meaning in this context. It is not that the Greeks will never pay back the debt but that the repayments on the debt are not affordable.

&gt;The idea is to reform their labour markets so they can actually reduce their public expense to a maamgeable level.

Public expenditure already is at a manageable level. Greece has budget surplus before taking into account the debt repayments. The problem is debt repayment. 

Besides, forcing further reform onto a population already humiliated and opposed to the Troika thumb is a recipe for disaster. More to the point it wouldn't actually work. Assume that reform does help the economy (which is especially contentious after 5 years of similar reform). OK - great, but realistically these are going to have to some bloody great reforms. There is mass unemployment and considerable debt repayments due later this year. I do not see how fixing this is the relatively simple case of weaken employment rights or whatever labour market reform.

edit:

&gt;The “Chelsea rent boys” song is rumored to have originated in the 1980s after newspapers reported that, in a dawn raid by police, a Chelsea hooligan was found in bed with a male prostitute (or “rent boy”).
Rival fans of Chelsea football club then adapted the Chelsea Headhunters (a notorious hooligan firm) threatening song “Chelsea aggro” to “Chelsea rent boys” and the song is still sometimes sung at matches. According to some Chelsea fans, it has even become more popular since the late 1990s.

null,false,bawbawbaw1,,Belfast,null,"&gt; Firstly the IRA (hasn't existed since 2005) its the ONH now. We will deal with them separately.

No, we won't. I'm not going to get into the semantics of the IRA - we will deal with them as the IRA, whether its P, C , R or otherwise is irrelevant to what we're talking about. Unless you have involvement with either MI5 or the IRA itself, you will not be aware of the membership difference. You're on a a very public forum talking about it, so I'm going to assume you are involved in neither. 

Whether McCann was going to be executed or not is irrelevant, the IRA were clearly involved in drug distribution, as evidenced [here](http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/exira-suspect-held-in-cannabis-raid-29471137.html) and [here](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/real-ira-kieran-doherty-admitted-drugs-link-28520896.html), two quick google searches without any deep digging. I'm pretty certain I would find more if I looked deep enough. As I stated previously, the IRA were let off the hook with more serious crimes, so supplying cannabis would be the least of their worries, nor would MI5/6 be particularly concerned with the IRA supplying substances. 

&gt; The British Government used everything at their disposal to discredit the PIRA, Consistently calling them Drug dealers, yet there has never been a significant case brought before the courts in the entire history of the troubles, No Drugs Bust, No mass arrests for Drugs, zip, zilch, zero, nada.

Your first fault here is assuming the British government were the only ones keeping tabs on IRA members. Not including the fact that the British government were often in talks with the IRA while denying all existing of backdoor options and it still remains to be seen how deep those connections go due to unreleased documents. As demonstrated above, drug busts have happened in recent years, primarily in the south. Its a bit difficult to bust a group of men you're trying to talk into giving up weapons while charging them with other criminal behaviour, and we have seen recently that many issues have been sweeped under the carpet. Someone as informed as yourself on the IRA should be keenly aware of this, considering, as you state, the IRA have been involved other criminal enterprises.

&gt; Compare that to there other endeavours, 15,000 people yes thats right 15,000 people where arrested and spent time in Jail for IRA activities and guess what, not a single one of them was for drug related crime. That there is a statistical oddity.

They weren't being held for drug related activity nor was it the purpose of their containment. I'd love to see your your source for this. I'm not going to doubt that 15,000 people were arrested. I will doubt the reason for their arrest when it comes to drug related activity as it was not in any way, shape or form a priority for security forces in the north. Simply put, it was not their rationale for arresting people. Your reasoning would be sweet in a normal western European country, but we are not a normal western European country. 

&gt; Now say you where to look at cigarette smuggling, diesel laundering, conterfeiting that would be a whole other story they seem to be terrible at that;getting themselves arrested all the time. You would think the magical ability to control the drug market unimpeded would be some sort of transferable skill that worked across all illicit trades, but no.

These activities still go on and the drug market is notoriously difficult to police - it is not easy to uncover the source of supply nor is it easy to find the user base, this is the cornerstone of the decriminalisation argument. You're going by assumptions; these other activities are primarily cross-border activities, and as I've stated above, people involved in the IRA *have* been arrested in the south on drug charges related to the wider gang problems, mainly in Dublin, and thats through looking at the top two results in google without looking at any other news items. Its fairly normal that groups involved in cigarette and fuel smuggling will also be involved in drug distrbution and supply, there is no reason that they wouldn't be. It is however, harder to prove.

&gt; P.S If you where buying Drugs in the 90's and Early 2000's you where buying them off loyalists and the local wee hoods where hardly going to admit that.

As stated in my last post, loyalists were heavily involved in drug distribution. That does not remove any responsibility from the IRA. Without going into much on a public forum, buying a bag of grass in a well known persons house in the arsehole of west Belfast was obviously not from a loyalist in Sandy Row or the Shankill. While tts anecdotal and you won't take much from it, you can believe what you want to believe, it happened and it still happens. Proving it legally is a different matter and I'm not a cop.
