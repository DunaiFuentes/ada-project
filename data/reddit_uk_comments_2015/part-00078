To swear by one's testicles was an ancient form of oath. To detest, at root, means ""to bear witness against;"" therefore, to curse, and implicitly, to hate to the bottom of one’s testicles. The ancient Israelites and Romans knew the significance of testicles. The words testify, testimony and testicle all come from the Latin testis, for testicles. When Roman men gave testimony, they held their testicles in their hand, for they regarded them as sacred. This custom is mentioned in the Old Testament.

null,false,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,null,"It is always a mistake to think in terms of energy in a collision. What matters is force  on the skull or acceleration of the brain - the two are so closely linked that you can use either. You also use the word ""load"" - if you take this as meaning force, that will do as well. Energy doesn't matter - it can go straight through into your body and be dissipated as heat, or it can be dissipated in the helmet lining, but the one place it won't end up to any great degree is the brain. If it did, it would end up as thermal energy and your brain would cook - which obviously doesn't happen. It's just not a useful quantity to track when looking at damage.

The reason that this matters is because the way of reducing the acceleration of the skull when it hits the ground or a car is by collapsing the liner. Suppose you hit the road: the skull has to come to a complete stop in the distance equivalent to squashing your scalp. That gives a very high acceleration, hence a high force on the brain. With a helmet, the lining can compress by up to 2cm as it slows the skull, which greatly reduces the acceleration because the skull doesn't have to stop as fast.

Now that polystyrene has been selected to have a certain modulus of compression - i.e. a fixed amount of force will compress the lining by a fixed amount, where the modulus is chosen to decellerate your head close to the maximum survivable rate (i.e. it's hard because that allows it to cope with higher-speed impacts).

Now will the polystyrene compress if the helmet is dropped? To compress it needs a force applied to it from both sides. In a crash, one side comes from the shell (because of the road impact) and the other comes from the acceleration applied to the head - the old F=ma of Newton's Second Law. If you drop it, the only force on the inside is due to the acceleration on the lining itself, i.e. m is much, much smaller for the polystyrene liner than for the head. This means that the force applied to the liner is commensurately smaller, so that the compression is commensurately smaller. And lower than a certain point the compression is elastic, so that the liner rebounds rather than being permanently compressed.

Because of this you can determine that the permanent compression of the liner is either zero (if it operated in the elastic regime), or very small - in the 0.1-1% range if you plug in reasonable figures.",null,0,null,1425160646,null,0,false,0,cp099jx,null,t3_2xh1ea,null,t1_cp099jx,null,t1_cp05l05,null,null,null,1427508626,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

The consequence for the British is they have no go-to default second language that would open the world to them. Hindsight would have everyone learn Esperanto, but history hasn't played that way.

Think about it; a Brit might choose to invest a lot of energy in learning... German, but that only opens up dialogue in a few states; Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

Does she has settled status (also known as ""indefinite leave to remain"") already? If not, then she is currently eligible to apply for settled status, as you are married and not separated, she applied for a visa before 9 July 2012, and she has lived in the UK as your partner for over 2 years. You also must intend to continue your relationship after you apply for settlement, which is your case may not be true, but may be difficult to disprove if you were co-operative.

If you separate from her, or you divorce, then she is no longer able to apply for settled status, as she has not lived in the UK for 10 years, and so does not qualify for a long residence. This is assuming there is no evidence of domestic violence.

This also assumes that her child is not a UK citizen and does not herself have settled status. If she did, then your wife may be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain as the primary carer of a settled dependent.

If she already has indefinite leave to remain, then she has the right to remain in the UK after a divorce.

- While in principle the UK could have vetoed all of the accession treaties, the political ramifications of a single nation shutting down EU progress would probably have been harsh, potentially leading to insurmountable tension within the EU;

- At the time every major UK party, including the Conservatives, was strongly in favour of expansion of the EU, so singling out Labour is perhaps misguided as I don't think the current situation would be meaningfully different had another party been in charge.

He stated that he did not want such circumstances to arise, ""and the best way to avoid this was to vote no in the referendum.""[292][293]

I'm a complicated case and my care is essentially palliative as there is no cure or treatment for it, they just do their best to firefight as things progress. Without the NHS I'd be dead for sure as I'm uninsurable and due to my disabilities, unable to work. 

My husband could never afford to pay for all my meds, tube feed and related equipment and constant hospital admissions. Especially as he's a type 1 diabetic on a pump, takes protective meds for his kidneys and requires monitoring of his retinopathy and other issues. We cost a lot between us!

I have a few friends that are Doctors and all of them say that A&amp;E is hell on earth. I respect anyone that agrees to do it, it sounds awful! 

As a frequent flier with my local hospital I'm always stunned by the number of people that abuse the system and then throw a tantrum when it takes longer than just going to their GP.  

Unless it's an obvious emergency (I'm at massive risk of stroke, aneurysm, arterial dissection, heart attack etc) then I always go to my GP first. I know I get special treatment even with the GP and therefore it's easier for me to get an appointment, visit or a callback but it still makes more sense to me to speak to them first!

I don't want to waste my time or anyone else's by sitting in the hospital when my GP could have dealt with my issue (especially as I have to wear a mask outside of the isolation rooms!) Plus if I *do* end up needing to go to the hospital, having my GP call ahead or send me with a letter means I'll be treated much faster anyway as I've essentially already been triaged!

In some cases I've arrived and been taken directly to the emergency admissions unit or directly onto the ward I need as they're expecting me and know what treatment I require. It makes the whole system run much better that way. 

Glad your heart isn't too bad!! I don't blame you for taking the perks where you can, with how hard you guys work and all the shit you take for it, you deserve some special treatment when it's your turn to be in the bed!! :D 

I definitely appreciate just how lucky we are to have the NHS. When I'm admitted I love to treat the staff as much as I can. There's a Morrison's next door to my local hospital and I'll send my carer or husband to buy big bags of treats so I can leave them at the nurses station.

It makes me smile to see the obviously stressed doctors and nurses swarm the desk, smiling widely and fighting like kids over who gets which lolly or whatever. I get one big bag for the day staff and one for the night staff so that it's fair. 

The one time I had nobody around to fetch me the sweets, I put my mask on and went down to the in-hospital Costa to buy everyone a drink. I probably look like a suck-up but I just really appreciate how hard you guys work. I wouldn't be here without you all!

It's only something small, a sweet or a drink, but it seems to really lift the mood on a ward and I just really like to say thanks.

I feel that Oscar has not been in great form recently, more specifically his passing was awful at Burnley. I think Ake has enough experience and is a good enough player to sit and protect the back 4, whilst Ramires sits back a lot but can power through the midfield safe in the knowledge Ake is still behind him and Fabregas can drop back too. Willian on the right due to his workrate and defensive abilities, and Zouma because Cahill was fucking trash against Cahill. 

For idea 2, if Oscar does play, I think we should stick with the 433 and have the midfield hold back a bit, but allow Oscar to push on more.

 [**Burning of Washington**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning%20of%20Washington): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Burning of Washington__ in 1814 was an attack during the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812) between [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) forces and those of the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America). On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the [Battle of Bladensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg), a British force led by Major General [Robert Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ross_(British_army_officer\)) occupied [Washington City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_City) and set fire to many public buildings, including the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) (known as the presidential mansion at the time), and the [Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Capitol), as well as other facilities of the [U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government).  The attack was in part a retaliation to American actions in the [Raid on Port Dover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Port_Dover).

Ideally, he would go for something like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=68b31).
