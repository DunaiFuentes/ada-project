Sure, some of these attributes may develop over time, but ultimately he has played centre midfield for most of his career, it's the position we bought him for, and the man himself has suggested it's his preferred position. Why does he need to be a ""true maestro style"" CM (whatever that means..)? If anything he is as close to a box to box midfielder we currently have, except maybe Hendo, and has a good range of passing, shooting ability, close control, and a very good engine. He is good enough for us right now, because we're not very good right now. You're whole point is moot saying that he isn't an ""LFC midfielder"" yet because the only time frame of relevance in this instance is now, and Can is good enough to be considered a good candidate for a central position.

null,false,Madyakker,null,null,null,"The council tax year usually runs 1st April to 31st March and you are charged annually. On the 1st of April the council will send everyone out bills for the full year. The councils realise that this is usually quite a lot for most people to pay in one go, so they agree that you can pay it in installments. For reasons best known to themselves (probably to do with budgets &amp; year end) councils traditionally collected the council tax in 10 payments (April - January) instead of 12 monthly payments. 

Lets say you moved in on 1st May and the council tax for the full year is £1200. SInce you weren't there in April, you would only be liable for 11/12ths of the full amount - £1100 in this case. Unfortunately you can't pay the council tax until you get a bill form the council. They can take ages to get round to doing this. I moved in May last year and it was July or August before I got a bill. 

Lets say you get a bill in August. You still owe them £1100 and it still needs to be paid before the end of the council tax year (end of March). So your £1100 would be split over 8 months leaving you £137.50 to pay each month.

Personally I don't like the whole 10 months charging so I choose to pay my council tax over 12 months. It just makes it easier for me to budget things. Edinburgh council had an option on their website asking if you wanted to pay over 10 or 12 months. Where I am just now didn't, however when I got the bill and phoned up to arrange my direct debit they asked if I wanted to pay over 10 months or 12.

    Ok not every game but in 2months I play 4 a day so let's not say I get 100 each day but 25 25x60=1500 1400+1500=2900 and that's just math

b) it's equally about men and women. If we take the statement, ""you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you,"" at face value, then he is remarking that both men and women are at fault for any disruption. It is unfortunate that it's preceded by a phrase that could be taken as, ""Here is the issue with girls in the lab,"" but that is not the sentiment used or intended.

c) His statement that, ""when you criticize them they cry,"" is again based on his experience; nevertheless, even if that was a general criticism then it is still true and, therefore, cannot be considered prejudicial. 

d) His use of the word, 'girls' has also been highlighted as demeaning. Well, I think that's fairly semantic, to be honest, and if it were sexist then a lot of people would be guilty without having a sexist bone in their body.

I believe that our local PTA offers an 'Oyster style' card, but it is only useful for regular travel cards - not PAYG journeys in the way that Oyster is (ie, top it up with £10 and use it until the £10 runs out, top it up again).

If I could pay my fare with a contactless debit card, like I can on London Underground, then my life is easier, it is quicker for the bus company and it is safer for their drivers.

i.e. does a person have the right to fly a UVF flag?

I'd say no, especially when it isn't actually their home (in property deeds terms), its in public space, and it can quite reasonably upset and offend alot of people.

But some people claim offence at gay rights flags.

So where is the line drawn?

I'd say the line is where a flag is professing support for an illegal organisation.

All else is fine, though residents might have a right to make reasonable representation to a fellow resident if they feel any particular flag is unwelcome.

Council schemes might encourage areas not to create intimidatory and anti-investment atmosphere by year round flag flying.

Lamposts are public property and no organisation has a right to use them as makeshift advertising boards. No flags should be allowed to be attached to lamposts and its about time this was enforced. Have the Alliance party even pushed this one in the Policing Board or via their Justice Minister? They're all words and no trousers on tackling sectarianism.

Radio 4 shows which are also Podcasts:

*In our time* - Hosted by Melyvn Bragg, he discusses a topic with any given 3 experts in the field. Topics as varied as the formation of Stars to the Greek poet Sapphos. 

*Law in action* - Discussion on recent issues in Law in the UK and the world, such last week which discussed the law of the sea regarding migrants.

*More or Less* - Tim Hartford (Undercover economist) discusses recent numbers in the news, such as how many migrants actually die in Quatar.

*Westminster Hour* - Caroline Quinn hosts 2 MPs and an expert on a topical subject to discuss recent political events.

History
*Dan Carlin* - Fantastic on loads of topics

*My History can Beat up your politics* - Primarily US discussion on current political events and past events which mirror it. Little left wing (but not crazy US right wing)

*Revolutions &amp; History of Rome* - Mike Duncann's Magnus Opus on Roman empire from the start to the fall of Rome is 180 episodes long, about a years worth of gym listening for me. His new podcast covers revolutions, hes done English and US and is currently on the French. 

*Civil War Podcast* - Husband and wife cover the US Civil war exhaustively form 1850-1867. 3 years of podcasts and they are still at 1862! Low production values but a lot of heart.

*History of England* - Covers from the arrival of the Saxons in Engand. Literally done by a bloke in his shed but once you get through teething episodes its really good

*When diplomacy fails* - Podcast about war. Well good bruv.

Comedy

*The Bugle* - Already recommended, top notch

*The Football ramble* - Already recommended, equally top notch

*The Flop House* - Podcast that covers bad movies, 3 hosts 2 of which are wirters fro the Daily show. So funny I had to sit down I was laughing so hard

Other
*Econtalk* - hour long podcast on economics/history with a guest (normally promoting new book/recent economic paper). Best Economics podcast available.

*Freakonomics* - Easy listening, more story telling than proper economics

*History of Philosophy without any gaps* - Covers Western Philosophy. Bit heavy for me somtimes as I know nothing about philosophy but the host is really good at explaining concepts in ways that make sense to idiots like ,e.

*LSE Public Lectures and Events* - Just broardcasts of lectures from visiting professors, such as ex Australian Prime ministers or former heads of IMF. 

*Serial* - Journalist covering a crime from 12 years ago. Hugely addictive, but be careful for spoilers online.

*Savage Lovecast* - Dan Savage gives relationship advice, it certainly made me empathise more with people in situations that I couldn't comprehend - such as a gay teen in Alabama dealing with his estranged brother.

I feel that he has ahowed the most leadership traits out of any of our newer signings. hendo and skrtel are an exception. Remember when balo took the PK away from Hendo and studge didnt appear to want to celebrate the goal? Can was there screaming at studge to come to the group hug and you can also see him trying to command that defensive line to catch others offside. Also, Lallana hasn't really displayed any leadership qualities since he has been on LFC and has also been injured quite often. 
As for Milner, great squad player with extreme versatility but I have yet to see him commanding his own teammates. Whenever I have watched him, I am impressed with his performance but i genuinely do not believe that he is a leader. Sure he is one the most experienced players on our currently young squad and is there to lead from experience but you surely can't expect a brand new signing to be captain on the basis that he played for city and a regular England international.

If you don't think it's inherently bad, why oppose it? There are always going to be people who use their ideology to try and justify their crimes, no matter what the ideology is. Crimes have been committed in the name of every ideology under the sun, whether it's Islam, Christianity, Atheism, Buddhism, Capitalism, Communism, Anarchism, anything. That's why I was asking my original question: If you oppose ~~a group~~ an ideology because some people who hold that ideology did a bad thing once, what do you end up supporting?

Also, no Muslim in this country is using their religion to ""get away with all manner of crimes"". The law applies to anyone, and whether the extremists believe their justified or not, they won't ""get away with"" anything. 

And I don't think the OP is whitewashing anything. Hate crimes against Muslims *are* rising, and should be just as unacceptable as crimes (hate or otherwise) committed *by* Muslims. If you try and appeal to the ""they started it"" mentality, then we end up with enormous tension in the whole of society, as we would end up disenfranchising and alienating whole swathes of the population. 

Also, your argument that the OP is trying to say it's ""the Tories fault for Islamists committing acts of violence and rape"" seems heavily to rely on the presumption that hate crimes are nothing but a natural response to Islamists, and that the government can or should do nothing to prevent this. Hate crimes are never acceptable, and are *always* the result of nothing more than racism. While the government is obviously not responsible for the acts themselves, they *are* responsible for trying to prevent them. The attitude of parties like the Tories, UKIP, and to an extent Labour and the Lib Dems, has definitely contributed to the growth of these hate crimes, as they've appealed to these racist and dangerous elements of society in order to get a quick vote with their policies and rhetoric (British values anyone?).",null,0,null,1434617984,null,0,false,0,csaivao,null,t3_3a5gae,null,t1_csaivao,null,t1_csa53x3,null,null,null,1437162713,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Burnham - tired and uninspiring. He came last in the last leadership contest aside from Abbott didn't he. But he is inoffensive and this probably means it benefits him most which is just terrible for Labour.

Kendall - Really, really, really needs to define how she is different to the Tories and offer something new policy-wise that the Tories don't have (and devolution isn't what people especially care about). Maybe tone down the school teacher vibe. Upside: sharp and gets that Labour needs to appeal to people other than its diehard supporters - 'the country comes first'. 

Corbyn - honest and likeable, appealing, but fear that his immigration policies won't appeal to the country. Still gets my second place vote. 

Cooper - I like her personal story and standing up for people who need welfare, I like that she makes the point that it was the banks and not over-spending that caused the deficit BUT what different is she offering?

So refinance then?

&gt;Assuming the £12 billion of welfare cuts set out in the Conservative manifesto can be fully identified

Easily done, stop paying out benefits to asylum seekers, change Benefit rules (no benefits unless you have paid into system for X amount of years, reduce or stop Child Benefit and convert to 'tax reduction' (this was only introduced after the way to help boost our birth rate)) 

Oh here, here let me try this idea, bit far out there in realm of Welfare...

Housing Benefits (rent to private landlords)

&gt;The figures from the Department of Work and Pensions show that the cost rose to £24.6-billion in 2013-2014, up from £22.99-billion when they took power in 2010

Controversial but here is what happens at present:

Person gets property, rents out to someone, person claims Housing Benefit, money goes from Govt to tenant, then Landlord - used at this point to pay off Mortgage, so indirectly the money benefits no-one, it is not 'spent' as such.

Cost is to Govt, benefit is to Bank (or landlord if he owns house outright) limited benefit to the 'Economy'

Instead, lets play devils advocate, lets take out a £50 Billion loan to invest in a MASSIVE housebuilding project.

£50 billion puts up house, places people into work, drives business and economy.

Once built, these house are handed to 'Council Control' on the Caveat they cannot be sold, or handed off to 'Private Equity Firms'.

Now lets see what happens instead.

Housing Benefit is no longer needed for Tenant in council property, it is classed as 'Non Revenue Generating' and instead simply incurs 'Maintenance Costs' (new build should be good for long period of time surely?)

Now flip it to someone working and NOT claiming Benefit, but living in rental.

Earn wage, rent paid to Landlord, paid to Bank again does not stimulate the Economy.

Post building boom, Rent paid to Council, property is 'Revenue Generating' and builds and income for Council, money then put into pot to pay off £50 Billion investment, once Pot paid off, income can be split 50/50 (after expenditures and running cost of housing stock) between council and Govt, Govt uses to reduce deficit, council uses to build more homes, invest locally, thus driving local economy

null,false,Shoreditchlawyer,null,null,null,"Hi, UK family lawyer here.

There are a number of issues on which you should seek advice

divorce 

If you have been married for &gt;1yr and continue to reside in England and Wales you can seek a divorce in E+W subject to you being able to satisfy the court the marriage has broken down.

As part of the divorce, the court is entitled to consider the financial needs of both parties. This will ensure, also, that you are ahead of your wife issuing in the U.S.

child maintenance

This is complex. There are various international treaties and cooperative agreements about ensuring child maintenance. Their applicability depends on the type of maintenance, the status of the parties and where the parties are residing. More often than not, the requesting party (the one receiving maintenance) will make the initial steps.

Speak to an NJ lawyer to find out your estimated liability there vs estimated liability in the UK (read the child maintenance pages on .gov.uk) to ascertain general levels of affordability.

Contact

Any parent who makes a child's relationship with their other parent contingent on their ability to pay child maintenance would be given short shrift by the court here. The child's welfare is the courts paramount consideration and the starting point, here at least, is that it is in the interests of the child to have a relationship with both parents UNLESS the contrary can be proven. I would be surprised if there wasn't a certain amount of parity between the two courts' approaches.

Again, speak to an NJ lawyer to see how they apply their rules.

Resolution, formerly the Solicitors Family Law Association, maintain a list of solicitors who specialise in family law. The law Society, also, has a list of solicitors who have obtained accreditation in family and/or child law.

The Office of Children Issues in the U.S. is the central authority there  dealing with child abduction and may be able to refer you to an attorney dealing with experience in international children issues.

Best of luck to you!

If he's going to play a defensive midfield role, tactical knowledge is just as important as ability and we've not really seen that from him yet. There is a reason why DM's peak at an older age than other positions, it's because of how important experience is. A good example is Lucas, he's become a better DM with age because of experience. Gareth Barry and Scott Parker are good examples, if you look when they've peaked. Claude Makelele - the greatest DM of all time didn't start getting recognition until his late 20's and then carried on improving in his 30's. It's very, very rare for a genuine defensive midfielder to be disciplined enough at 21.

If we ask him to be a box-to-box midfielder which he may be more suited for right now, it then puts shackles on Henderson. Him and Milner should be our workhorses going box to box, with someone sitting behind to sweep up. If you put him into a more attacking midfield role; is he going to displace the like of Countinho or Lallana who are more threatening in that position.

It's all about finding him a position and giving him time to develop. Right now he isn't quite there in terms of being in our strongest 11, he'll have to come in and play a variety of positions which is gain him much needed experience. I know everyone is eager for him to be a midfielder but I think we'll see him play in defence, midfield and in attacking areas next season and I don't have a problem with that. The more positions he learns, the more tactically aware he'll be when he is made into a permanent midfielder. At 21, any game time for him at this level is valuable.

&gt;This case is often listed, misleadingly, alongside cases... of convicted criminals who challenge their deportation on Art 8 grounds. In fact, the case concerned a man who came to the UK as a student and was refused leave to remain and did not concern deportation on grounds of criminal conviction. The immigration judge had allowed his appeal on the basis of a former Home Office policy (DP3/96) which said that if an individual lived in the UK with a settled spouse for two years or more without enforcement action being taken against them, they were entitled to leave to remain. The appeal was also allowed on Art 8 grounds – he had a long-term relationship with a British citizen and they had lived together for four years. The reference to the cat was one detail provided by the couple as evidence of their long-term relationship but did not form any part of the tribunal's reasons for deciding that he should be allowed to stay in the UK.47 The Home Office appealed but the senior immigration judge upheld the decision on the basis that the former Home Office policy (DP3/96), although it had since been withdrawn, still applied in this case (due to the date of the initial decision)

I happen to think parents should be able to take children out of school in term time. My kids, my life, my options in educating my progeny. 

And I don't think it makes a difference whether I am taking them to museums, or spending the day drawing with sidewalk chalk. My kids, my choice.

I myself fall into all of those categories, incidentally: Odds are, that's how you were picturing me. That's not a coincidence.

Labour was the first to adopt All-Women Shortlists (AWS) and -- prominent female leaders in other parties notwithstanding -- of the major parties only Labour have come close to having a 50% female parliamentary party. If we stop using them, we won't magically carry on having that kind of representation. The failure of the other parties to elect women is evidence of this.

*Everyone* has innate prejudices which make it very, very difficult to judge other people 'on merit' or treat them equally. This has been shown over and over again, in dozens of areas: Stop-and-search statistics, arrest and conviction rates, the weight judges and juries give to witness statements; how job interviews and CVs are judged; exam results; literary awards; how likely people are to interrupt or ignore you in casual conversation... The list goes on and on.

The people in this thread claiming that these things should be done 'on merit', without any rules about how people are selected, are demonstrably wrong in their claims that they, or anyone, is capable of making such a judgment.

You may not (indeed, should not) like the fact that you are more likely to listen to someone who looks like David Cameron or even Ed Miliband than you are to someone who looks like Diane Abbot, but it almost certainly is a fact *even if you're a black woman*.

Now, as to OP's question: Yes, I agree with All-Women Shortlists. I do not believe that you could walk into a meeting of the PLP and correctly guess which women were selected on All-Women Shortlists and which on open lists. They are *all* there on merit.

There are various other rules in the Party to ensure that minorities are represented (for example, when nominating an MP there are rules to make sure people from ethnic minorities are represented). I would happily see those rules expanded. We live in a country where: the government is attacking people with disabilities; where we imprison proportionally more black people than does the notoriously racist US; where we have deep religious and ethnic divides resulting from conflicts around the world, many of which are partly our responsibility; where a major newspaper refuses to use the correct pronuons when discussing transgendered people. We need to make sure the most vulnerable are protected and we do that, in part, by allowing them to represent themselves at every possible level of our Party, and of our society.",null,0,null,1434619924,null,0,false,0,csajbek,null,t3_3a6s1i,null,t1_csajbek,null,t3_3a6s1i,null,null,null,1437162986,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

null,false,notjustaprettybeard,eng-somerset,Bath,null,"I don't think Thatcher is solely or even mostly to blame for the death of British manufacturing, even if she did put the final nail in its coffin. I think it mostly comes down to the complete breakdown in relations between the working classes and their capitalist managers when the growth and optimism of the 60s were brought crashing back to Earth during the oil crisis of the 70s. Tensions between those two groups have always been high, of course - I don't know quite how Britain came to have such a pronounced class system (I suspect it goes back to the Norman conquest, but if I expound too much on that without really knowing anything about it I'll end up being mocked in /r/badhistory) but it's certainly been a feature of our society since time immemorial, and not to our benefit. 

However, for most of the time it's been a stable, if not comfortable configuration. Even in the first world war when Eton-educated toffs sent wave after wave of proles over the top to keep the German machine gunners entertained, it seems as though a working relationship was (somehow, against all reason) maintained. What eventually caused the system to snap, perversely enough, was when the working class saw their lot get better for a prolonged period as the first world economies boomed in the period of post-war expansion. When that finally came crashing down round everyone's ears in the 70s, and of course it wasn't the landed gentry that bore the brunt, that was the final straw. Full scale class war finally erupted and the workers downed tools. I wasn't around back then, but the way my Dad tells it the Country ground to a halt and no one was willing to put aside their differences for the common good. It's difficult to blame people who definitely were being exploited for acting that way, but nevertheless the longer it went on the worse it got for everyone and so the powers that be were really left with only one option, and that was to sell it all off and focus our economic activity elsewhere to try and get things moving again. I definitely don't want to let 'them' off the hook, as it was 'their' legacy of incompetent mismanagement and callow disregard for the lives of the people actually doing the hard graft that fueled the whole situation in the first place, but once the damage was done I don't see there was any other way out. Did the unions go too far at the tail end of the seventies, playing a part in their own downfall with brinkmanship and obstinacy? I don't know, I wasn't there, but if I know anything about human nature then the answer is probably yes, duh. Call me a cynic. 

Idle conjecturing about how we got in this mess aside, the question is becomes, is there anything we can do about it? I'd like for our manufacturing sector to recapture at least some of its former glory, as I do think real prosperity is hard to come by unless you're actually contributing tangible things of value. Information goods and financial instruments are all very well but there's something comfortingly real about machines that do work. I also think that one of the major contributing factors to our loss of national identity is that our old one was so tied in to industriousness. Now, you could argue that national identities are nasty things anyway and only lead to ugly crockery and colonialism, and maybe you'd be right, but without one that's at least loosely tied into something worthwhile you end up with five million people voting for UKIP for lack of a better idea. 

How can we achieve that? I'd like to see a move away from the worker/boss paradigm given that we've seen how that turned out already and I think trust between the toffs and the oiks has eroded to the point where it's pretty much irreparable. If we're to really get working again they'll have to meet in the middle somewhere.

It explicitly makes the point though that it is concerned only with networks of those exploiting children for sex. Does the majority of acted upon paedophilia not happen within the family at the hands of a single abuser?

The point about the Saville revelations is that they seem to be a true turning point in the reporting of sex crimes against kids and the extent to which they are taken seriously by the authorities. It's a single high profile case that has been a true marker in societal attitudes. I suspect you know full well why the revelations of one of the most famous men in the country over the last half century stand out, and why he will be remembered long after any of the individuals in these cases with many perpetrators are individually forgotten. 

It is, as you know, not impossible to refer to the Asian gang problem. Nor do I at all deny that it exists. My sister has worked in social services in northern towns for close to 20 years - I have heard a lot of stories for a very long time. 

I just agree with the other massively down voted poster upthread that said other forms of sex with kids is comparatively under reported in the media. There are sound reasons for this, primarily because many kids still do not report themselves. The biggest of all is that I suspect the majority of perpetrators have one victim - a sister or a daughter - and their identification also identifies the victim. 

It is still under reported and will continue to be. And the more we focus on this one thing to the exclusion of all else the more the authorities governed by the elected will focus on it to the exclusion of all else, and the only consequence of that is more failed victims.

I agree that it should be easy to make judgement calls on the individual situations of the families etc, or to understand the difference between you giving it some ""if you were really hungry, you'd eat it"" and someone who routinely fails to feed their kids, but the fact it that teachers are busy, have a large number of kids in their care, and the risk of missing something is disproportionately high compared to a 'false alarm'.  

If a teacher fails to identify a child who is at risk, either physically, or in their access to education and opportunity, the consequences are potentially significant and severe, both for the child and the teacher.  Should they be expected to make a judgement call on whether to make a notification, or is it safer and easier to have a set of simple rules that everyone is expected to follow that reduce the risk overall.

One of the interesting things about the regional UK police forces is that you can kinda fit them into differing specialisations. Belfast does real violence. Glasgow is murder with lots of individual violence and Manchester is booze fueled crowd disruption etc and perfect for civil disturbances.

600k for training really isn't a hell of a lot and since they're asking Manchester they're either working to a recommendation or expectation. Basically something Manchester can provide.

I've been looking a decent one for the last week and a half (two or 3 times a day), but all as I seem to find are overpriced, poor condition or insurance claims (D or C). The odd one which ticks all the boxes is sold before I can get to them.

Added to the horror stories I read about 125's being the most popular bikes stolen, made me start looking at jumping feet first into a DAS.

Firstly what your saying is literally factually incorrect: http://data.gov.uk/dataset/jobseekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_by_ethnicity , https://fullfact.org/factchecks/migrants_foreign_nationals_benefits_claim_likely_UK-27395 

Secondly I just cannot fathom a situation where you would go to the job centre and they would turn your away because you're white, or give extra benefits to a black immigrant in the same situation. You're entitled to the same benefits as anyone else in your situation. Affirmative action is illegal in the UK, and if you weren't spouting bollocks out of your arse, you would know that every benefits form makes a large point that you don't have to fill in your ethnicity, religion, or skin colour if you don't want to. So the only room for discrimination is during the interview process of getting benefits, and to believe that, there would need to be systematized discrimination that the government has consciously decided to benefit minorities over white people. That's just farcical. 

I think what you mean is that if you're an able bodied young male, the government expects you to be able to make it on your own without requiring too many benefits (which is a reasonable attitude) **regardless of your immigration status or skin colour***

This is super hard. Honestly, hats off. 

You probably deserve a hug, and a massive raise, and..hell, a standing ovation. Perhaps a bottle of wine and some chocolate. 

This is an honest question: is it really that hard to see kids that are at risk vs just kids? Are you really afraid , so afraid, that if you miss one tiny thing, that you might lose your actual job? If so...i am so, so very sorry.

&gt;If it helps, think of the inconvenience caused to good parents like you as the cost of protecting innocent kids against bad parents.

This is causing good parents to turn 'bad'. This kind of thing is *wrong* and doesn't work.  Bad parents...are bad. Decent parents just want to take the kids to play in the sand for a few days.

You're making the mistake of thinking I oppose an ideology because of one or two past wrongs, this is not the case for a present ideology that advocates rape and murder in places like Iraq. This isn't a fuzzy line or boundary, as an example ISIS actively teaches its members to rape and pillage. It has done so to great effect and it is doing so at this very second of time. The rape of non-muslims is based on religious teachings, justified as the women are all infidels or whores, the terms interchangeable to these people. This kind of religious teaching is not confined to North Iraq and East Syria, it was also taught to those within our own country.

As it was reported in great detail the rapists in Rotherham were not brought to justice quickly because of allegations of racism against Pakistanis keeping the police at arms length. The blurred mixing of race and religion aside, this was a clear example of those committing crimes getting away with them due to racial and religious profiling.

Hate crimes are a natural response to Islamists committing mass rape and the occasional religiously motivated murder. What I would question about your response is that you don't seem to attribute the rise of these hate crimes as a reaction to tragic and horrific events but towards political parties. You don't seem to wish to condemn those committing rape and murder but to lay the blame for reactions to it at the feet of politicians. Is it so hard to admit that the actions performed almost exclusively by a minority in the country elicit a reaction?

To top it off you seem to think that condemning these actions and stating the facts of the matter, as the Lib Dems and Labour have done is to be appealing to racist and dangerous elements in our society. Blaming the Lib Dems in particular for causing hate crimes is a bizarre thing to state, I'm sure /u/LocutusOfBorges would have some consternation at such a claim.",null,0,null,1434624431,null,0,false,0,csakda5,null,t3_3a5gae,null,t1_csakda5,null,t1_csaivao,null,null,null,1437163770,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

This is what governs what speed you get, a short line over Aluminium cable is still going to be slower than the same line over thick gauge copper.

FTTC itself is subject to loss of rates over distance, VDSL line loss is steeper than ADSL line loss, indeed the only product that does not lose sync rates over the line is FTTP.

This is why I laugh when people state 'XYZ company internet is shit' then swap to another, who gives them the exact same sync rate.

Then that is not even taking into account the elaborate internal set ups some users can have with the DIY extensions. Hence why ISPs tell customers to test in the Test Sockets of the line, this is the Openreach Demarcation point. Anything after that is the users problem.

This is why they are allowed to advertise 'UpTo' because in ideal circumstances, you indeed would get upto XYZ.

and as for the idea 'Charge for different sync rates' not everyone utilises their maximum throughput, most people browse the net, users kbs of data, streaming? HD is 5.5 Mbit/s upwards PER DEVICE.

Over reliance of devices to stream content is what slows your line down, hopefully the UFO project in York (you lucky bastards) will do away with 'slow sync' issues as it would take a LOT of people streaming from your router to impact a 1Gbit/s service.",null,0,null,1434624851,null,0,false,0,csakgxs,null,t3_3a9p8m,null,t1_csakgxs,null,t1_csak7tq,null,null,null,1437163840,null,37,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,37,null

Drug still seems to be in final stages of trial.

&gt;In 2010, PTC Therapeutics released preliminary results of its phase 2b clinical trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with participants not showing a significant improvement in the six minute walk distance after the 48 weeks of the trial.[5] This failure resulted in the termination of a $100 million deal with Genzyme to pursue the drug.

Honestly, perhaps they have family here. Imagine you were in this situation. How far would you travel just to be with family you felt you could trust? How far to be in a country where you could speak the native language (seemingly quite well), and integrate quicker?              
It's easy to assume they're just thinking about benefits but in reality after escaping their own country it's more likely their main concern is just safety.        
Plus, if you can't afford a plane ticket then truck/train hopping is pretty much the only choice you have.        
Looking at this in that light, it's a pretty grim clip. Of course it's not nice for the truck drivers either, and it's not fair he'd be fined if caught, but perhaps it's our asylum/border control laws that are wrong, not these girls?        
Perhaps the law should be that if he was unknowing he shouldn't be fined, or that if their bid for asylum is deemed genuine and successful he shouldn't be.        
     
EDIT: Judging by some responses I'm getting, there seems to be a bit of confusion from some people over the point I'm making. All I'm saying here is that I can understand why these girls and others like them may want  to come to the UK in particular. I'm not saying that we have to let them in because of it.

If you don't think that brief description is marginalizing of the effect a top keeper like Cech can have for a team, then I don't know what to tell you. Cech has slowed down a bit but that hasn't really limited his effectiveness or stature amongst the top goalkeepers in the world, because a lot of his greatness lies in reaction time and positional awareness. If you got him, less than a quarter through his first season he'd would set the Premier League record for most shutouts. He is quite literally one of the best (if not *the* best) goalkeepers in the history of the Premier League. My personal opinion is that Cech would easily be your top keeper for the duration of a new five-year contract and possibly longer, barring a serious injury. 

Van Persie wasn't going to be the difference for you in winning a title anyway, and Wenger didn't want the wages headache that he was bringing (as you said). Regardless, that's a very different situation from this, where Cech puts Arsenal right into championship talk for next season, and on wages even a thrifty manager like Wenger would live with.

Ultimately, what we both believe doesn't really matter in the slightest, so if you'd rather bank on the potential development of a player into something he may or may not become, that's entirely your prerogative. But having Cech in your side over the next 3-5 years (you say 3 at most, I say 4 at minimum) makes you much more of title contenders than having Ox for the same duration, particularly for a squad such as Arsenal's with all of its attacking players. And while you're right that Ox will have utility beyond that duration, we'd all be foolish if we expected every prospect to reach his peak potential.

EDIT: I guess I can also say, if I had my druthers, I'd rather keep Cech as our backup GK than use Ox as a depth piece.",null,0,null,1434625665,null,0,1434626330,0,csakoes,null,t3_3a5yym,null,t1_csakoes,null,t1_csail33,null,null,null,1437164019,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

Nurses and Doctors who spoke out about him at the time made it a point not to leave him alone with children in hospitals. I repeat. The man was scum.  Those men were scum. The reason they got away with it was the same reason scum get away with things. Because no one was willing to stand up and do something. 

The majority of serial killers are far and away white. Does that mean we should be treating all white people as potential serial killers? No? Oh because that's fucking sensible. 

All gangs who were left to their own devices without intervention act like this. 

Okay. The absolute majority of people who destroyed the economy were white men. It's the numbers stupid... white people are greedy and just incapable of controlling their greed. I mean look at history where they robbed entire nations and even murdered and raped millions for ""profit"". 

You know the above statement is stupid. But you are saying similar things. You are blaming an entire group of people because you think the abuse reached a threshold where you can afford blame to every person of a specific allele pool and belief system without looking into how crime is created. 

White + Catholic. Remember the children abused by the Church. The Thousands of Children who were abused by Priests and yet we never blamed all Catholics and White people for that. Even when they ""protected"" children by simply moving these priests to places like Africa and India where they molested unknown numbers of children. Many of these priests are still around somewhere with access to children. 

Yet we blame those priests. Not the entire Catholic Faith. Why? Common Fucking Sense. 

It's easy to hate something that's different. Now put it this way. At no point did the cops try to do something about this. It's not that they couldn't. It's that they wouldn't. It's simple. 

""Hey, is this Racist?"" That's all! That simple question asked to some helpful ""Brown People"" would have helped create a proper response to the start of these gangs and nipped them in the bud. What happened was that these gangs realised no one was going to do anything about them and they began to expand and work more and more openly. 

When football hooliganism was rife, why were there so many ""fans"" fighting? Initially because everyone was powerless to stop them and no one was doing enough to fight it. When we started cracking down on it, the practice almost vanished. Now the ""Fans"" outnumber the ""Hooligans"" by a huge number. Why were they so common once upon a time? Because it was easy to recruit, easy to get away with it and any one who said anything was quickly silenced. 

Again the majority of the football hooligan came from inner cities and poverty. And I don't think they set out to ruin football. I think they were passionate football fans who were told that passion meant fighting other football fans and these ""arguments and pub scuffles"" turned into horrific violence. 

Had the police simply asked for help from the community, they would have got it and the community would have been better policed. The reason we saw Rotherham is the sort of poverty and alienation that's endemic to British Pakistanis leading to the formation of gangs and being seen as a separate group for more than 40 years (British Pakistanis came to the UK before British Indians and were mainly factory workers on graveyard and weekend shifts. That's why they didn't integrate. They worked the periods where their white and black counterparts were asleep or socialising.). If they were policed properly then guess what? They wouldn't have done this.

The kid wouldn't get off so the driver turned off the engine and said he wasn't going anywhere until he paid or got off. The kid was being loud and quite aggressive after that. They can get stuck then, the only real option would be to call the police. In the end just to get bloody moving I paid the money and he got on. But all over 5p - if I was the driver I would have rather avoid the hassle and let him on, but it had gone beyond that. 

There was another time I was overcharged. He insisted the fare was £2.50 when I *knew* it was £1.50. I said ""sorry, you are wrong, here is your £1.50"" and got on. He switched off the engine, said ""I know the fares mate, not you - this bus is out of service"" and told me to get off. I paid the extra under protest and had to go through the rigmarole of a complaint where I eventually got my pound back.

This case I think we can be pretty confident on, she had the money but the driver was being a dick. She was with a kid, there are no reports of any abuse or threats.

Your assumption relies on much more extraordinary circumstances - such as these two girls living fairly privileged lives with disposable income; logged onto the internet and did some thorough research on the European country they'd most like to spend the rest of their lives. And so, despite living fairly comfortable lives back home, where they also have luxuries like the internet, they decided to hop on the back of a lorry, like we all do when we live in stable countries with disposable income and want to travel.

Away vs Spurs, away to Sunderland, home to everton, probably a lot more. If he was leaving us I hope he goes abroad, I don't think I could take him scoring against us.


There are some negatives, a lot of times his head goes down and he stops stretching the defense. I thought at times this was because he thought he was better than us. Then last week i heard that during the game vs Wales Mertens, Hazards, KDB etc were begging Benteke and Lukaku to either go to the front post or back post when they got the ball wide, neither man would listen whatsoever, both just took up that position on the edge of the 6 yard box. Both like standing beside each other every single time the ball went in to the box. He's smarter than that, but sometimes he just seems a bit lazy



His worst performance was probably the 1-0 loss to Leicester, he offered nothing that day. I also remember the week after the 1-0 against WBA (when Richardson got sent off) Given was on 5live, and he said a lot of the guys in the team were disappointed with how little he tried when the ball was knocked up to him

Enlightenment ideals were a big thing in Britain, it had a constitutional monarchy and you couldn't find anywhere else in Europe that had as much religious, social and economic freedom with the exception of the Dutch Republic. People were hoping the French would adopt parliamentary democracy and possibly a constitutional monarchy. Also at the time there were serious movements and plans in Britain to reform the voting laws and to abolish slavery.

The thing with revolution though is that it's often quite violent and when it involves a massive underclass of people who have been downtrodden and treated poorly for centuries it tends to get especially vicious. That favourable view the British had at the time started to turn pretty sharply when the orgy of violence and breakdown in order in France became clear and widely known. The execution of Louis was especially contentious. The government got especially spooked and those voting reforms and slavery abolishment ideas were shelved and put back by about 30 years.

Of course the French Revolution and later the Napleonic Wars are much more complex than what can be put into a Reddit comment but reducing everything down to ""we hated their republicanism"" is a bit ignorant. You kind of have to keep in mind that even by 1812 a lot of Napoleons former admirers and most ardent supporters were turning against him.

Social housing has been an issue in the UK ever since Thatcher gutted it. The way social housing works is that cases are either 'priority' or not. People who are not priority cases (like he mentioned, white, male, of working age, educated) are not put into a priority case. Colour is a small factor to consider but it wouldn't be the sole reason for bumping a case up to a priority. 

If I was going to make a point about that, i'd mention about how frequently women get priority case status than men. 

The big things that will get you bumped up to priority case status are, middle / old aged, under 18s, women, having children. 

The perception is that women are more vulnerable so they get priority status more frequently. It is just an extension of that logic towards black or immigrants.

On the other hand, I feel that if these are his (or his agent's) feelings at the moment, and considering how **strongly** they have shown it, we might as well make something of off him, and I think Liverpool are right to not be selling him to the highest bidder, but holding out for the price they want.

Lewandowski performed spectacularly last season at Bayern, and if Sterling is as you say:

Agreed, without a doubt. But at the same time:

Three quarters of the ""British"" army was, in fact, not British (Dutch and ""German"").

Von Bulow's 30 000 strong army must have been only a contributing factor I guess. As soon as they arrived at the right time, the battle -which was far from decided- suddenly became lost for Napoleon. 

Also.

""The Treasury are effectively the principal Government stakeholder for The Crown Estate"", ""The Crown Estate is formally accountable to Parliament"" makes this point clearer. Those two entities may belong to ""her majesty"", but she has no power over them, they just belong to the head of state as a matter of ceremony.

It may seem confusing to some, but the monarch and the monarchy are not the same thing, Liz is basically the face of the country yes, but in court for example, it's so and so vs. The Crown, not so and so vs. Elizabeth II. The Crown is the state.

The argument that the monarch is a counterweight to parliament is foolish, she has very few powers and would face a public backlash if she used any of them. Obviously the house of commons would want people to believe they answer to our figurehead, as it leaves them without a head of state they need to actually answer to.

And now contactless payment has come along you need to incorporate links into card processing companies like Visa and Mastercard, which have to be very fast to check if the card is real and to put a holding charge on the card within the time the person has the card on the reader.

And don't forget in London you pay a flat fare for buses no matter how far you travel, which I doubt Stagecoach or Firstgroup would like to do as they can't afford to make all their fares one price.

That means you have to get people to swipe on and off the buses, and you have to have a local database on the bus which tracks where it is so you can work out how much to charge the person. And this means you have to have enforceable ""zones"" or fare boundaries in case the person gets on/off away from a bus stop.

I feel next season when Sturridge isn't fit we should play again in a twin number 10 role like [this](http://i.imgur.com/eRZCAXT.png
), with our fullbacks providing the width.

I don't want us playing with a back three, I want our full backs to be pacey and fit and be able push forward as much as possible and be an attacking threat, however for that we need a quality holding midfielder who for the most part stays back while we are on the attack so that he can help the centre backs if we possibly get caught on the counter. Contrary to what most people say on this subreddit I don't believe Can offers this, he's naturally a box to box type player, and would fit into the positions that Henderson and Milner play, for this reason I think it is important for us to sign a new holding midfield player because of Lucas' injury problems.

It is absolutely key that we sign a proven quality centre forward who is mobile and has good finishing. I think Ings might surprise me, but I think we would be mad not to splash big money on a striker this window.

In 1983, Thatcher had a major popularity boost with her response to the Falklands invasion.  In 1992, swapping Thatcher out for Major helped close down the Labour lead that had built up.  At the same time, Labour was in the wilderness, and tried both socialism _and_ social democracy to no avail.

2) This government and the one before it are going harder and faster than Thatcher in some areas.  Thatcher never privatised Royal Mail.  Thatcher, as far as I know, didn't cripple the NHS to the extent it's being attacked now.

3) Whatever the Coalition did over the past five years pales in comparison with what the Tories, alone, will do now that they're kept in check only by their even-more-right-wing backbenches.  We, the electorate, have seen absolutely nothing yet.

4) A lot of anti-Coalition sentiment was quite successfully dumped by the Tories on the Lib Dems—you expect unfair policies from the Tories, but for Clegg to adopt them was betrayal.  This helped smokescreen the actual threat in this election.

As well as that shocking headline figure of 15m UK households not getting the speeds they're advertised, there's more. Advertising guidelines say that at least 10% of customers should be able to achieve the maximum speeds shown in adverts. Even if that was a good target (it isn't), we found broadband packages that aren't even managing that!

For example, we found that only 4% of customers on TalkTalk’s 17Mbps package, and just 1% of people on BT and Plusnet’s 76Mbps deals, are getting the top advertised speeds. Yeah, 1% &gt;_&lt;

A pretty amazing 71k people have signed [our broadband speed petition](http://www.which.co.uk/campaigns/broadband-speed-service/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=Ruk-organic&amp;utm_campaign=Reddit-broadband) to sort this out (and I know many of them are Redditors!) We're now asking people to [send a message to the advertising watchdogs](https://whichcouk.bsd.net/page/speakout/2015-06-broadband-advertising-generic?js=false) to change their advertising rules (advertised speeds should be what the majority of customers get, not 10%).

Don't touch any of these institutions just yet, there was a large story about one such institution wiping out, which was a result of the sole owner losing a large amount of the Bitcoins, as in literally just losing them. He caused a bank run, but without any legislation, insurance or precedent the whole thing collapsed and  a lot of people were left out of pocket.

As well as that there is a serious risk that your Bitcoins will be lumped in a single account, with all the other users, and if the password is ever cracked you'll lose everything.

What we think of as royal properties fall into several different categories.

There's the Crown Estate (and some peripheral stuff like the Royal Collection), which is actually owned and managed by the government and would certainly not be kept by the royal family if the UK became a republic.

Then there's the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, which are owned by the royal family but managed by the government, with profits going to the Queen and the Prince of Wales.  The Duchies have some special legal rights such as exemption from various taxes, and they include some pretty weird property such as the whole of Lancashire's foreshore and all ships wrecked in Cornwall.  At the very least, they would not continue to exist in the same manner if the UK were to become a republic, and I think there would be a strong argument that the government should take them over in their entirety.

Lastly, there's the royal family's actual private property, such as Sandringham and Balmoral, which they would presumably keep.  However, they would have to start paying taxes on it.

There are lots of things that could affect the outcome in this situation:

**In regards to the division of equity.** Whether or not all of the names are on the legal title, the type of co-ownership that is at play (joint tenants, tenant in common (equal shares or unequal shares)) and the nature the of improvements that have been made, will all have an influence on how the courts divide the equitable share of the home.

**In regards to the sale of the home.** The Courts would look at a number of factors when determining whether to sell the home. These are defined under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1986, section 15.

(1)The matters to which the court is to have regard in determining an application for an order under section 14 include—

    (a)the intentions of the person or persons (if any) who created the trust,

    (b)the purposes for which the property subject to the trust is held,

    (c)the welfare of any minor who occupies or might reasonably be expected to occupy any land subject to the trust as his home, and

    (d)the interests of any secured creditor of any beneficiary.

The courts will likely never sell the property if there are children living in it. If the property was purchased as an investment, the court is highly likely to issue an order of sale.

**As there are so many issues that could be at play here,** for the best advice you would need to take all of your documentation to a solicitor specialising in conveyancing or estate management and trusts.

If you would like to do a bit of reading around the area then I recommend starting [here]

This is true. And whilst historically there have been obvious benefits from automation there has been a lot of harm done too.

I don't call it progress when it's putting people out of work without a safety net. Denying people opportunity is the opposite of progress.

I'm not opposed to technological advancement at all. But it isn't the be all and end all. It should be applied responsibly and ethically, not at the cost of human dignity or quality of life. Primum non nocere.

null,false,whistdrive,null,null,null,"&gt;The point about the Saville revelations is that they seem to be a true turning point in the reporting of sex crimes against kids and the extent to which they are taken seriously by the authorities. It's a single high profile case that has been a true marker in societal attitudes. 

You think the reasons why Saville's victims were ignored are similar to the reason the gangs' victims were ignored? The Asian gang issue wasn't taken seriously because of fears of looking racist, and because of victim blaming--because they're basically poor and troubled and presumed promiscuous. With Saville, it was what? The sexist attitudes prevalent at the time? His celebrity power? It seems the media turning point with the gangs was the investigation by the Times, which came immediately before the Saville scandal broke. I'm not following the connection.

&gt;I suspect you know full well why the revelations of one of the most famous men in the country over the last half century stand out, and why he will be remembered long after any of the individuals in these cases with many perpetrators are individually forgotten.

Because it went on for so long and he never got canned? Because he was singularly awful? It just seems like if there were a whole bunch of guys on the level of a Saville we'd call it something else. Fill me in here.

&gt;I just agree with the other massively down voted poster upthread that said other forms of sex with kids is comparatively under reported in the media. There are sound reasons for this, primarily because many kids still do not report themselves. The biggest of all is that I suspect the majority of perpetrators have one victim - a sister or a daughter - and their identification also identifies the victim. 

That's a good point and... well, I feel you've kind of answered your own concern there.

&gt;It is still under reported and will continue to be. And the more we focus on this one thing to the exclusion of all else the more the authorities governed by the elected will focus on it to the exclusion of all else, and the only consequence of that is more failed victims. 

So they'll focus on gangs to the exclusion of all else... but... how do you catch individuals abusing family members--in what way do you divert energy into tackling this? Your sister works in social services so you'll know more than me. This sounds like a cold calculus but if you bust a ring you've helped a whole bunch of kids. If you catch an abusive stepdad you've helped a couple. And the thing about Rotherham et al. was that it was all looks so preventable. Stop worrying about looking racist. Stop fretting about 'community cohesion'. Don't arrest dads trying to rescue their daughters. Don't send social workers to diversity training if they speak up. How many heads rolled have rolled?

BT doesn't sell a 76Mbps service, they sell an up to 76Mbps service, with a personalised and much more accurate speed estimate when you order. It should be that personalised estimate that should be taken into account when working out if someone gets ""what they pay for"".

e.g. BT tells me that I can actually expect 54-73Mbps. I actually do get 73+Mbps with a different ISP, because my line is good, but it is clear that they are ultra conservative in what they tell people

So yes, of course most people won't get 76Mbps, but that was never what was sold.

Unsure what you mean by this:

Speedtests only test Throughput to your device, they don't test network latency or packet loss. By testing off network your actually testing the network you are connected to at time of testing.

To be fair, ISP only trust their own speedtests for a number of reasons, normally because they know it is specced and trusted (and in most cases linked to customers line profiles, hence the need to insert your telephone number)

For example, I doubt their is any server (or was) capable of testing the 1Gbp/s lines being tested?

I gave you an example of moderation : what unfolded after the Tennis Court Oath and before the Escape at Varennes. 
Nobody wanted to depose the king nor abolish the royalty at first. And having a stable and recognizable center of power, here the King Louis XVI, was probably the most important thing to avoid a complete collapse and everyone knew that.

The Escapte at Varennes was literally the King spitting on the people saying : ""I am going abroad in safety while foreign armies will invade your homes and kill you and the Revolution. Then I'll be back on the Thrones, but without Constitution, without equal rights for everyone, and more absolute monarchy and privileges."".

Once *the King himself* betrayed the Nation, how could there be moderates ?
Moderation implies that all the parties in the dispute, while disliking each other, can find some common ground to trust each other.
It wasn't possible anymore after the King fled.

So, 

&gt;At all points there were only a handful of people who actually agreed with any of the attempted settlements. Hence the lack of moderates. The reactionaries thought given time they'd be able to go back towards noble privilege and absolute monarchy. The radicals weren't going to stop while stuff like active citizenry and nonjuring priests were a thing.

is not true at all. Because *there were moderate*, and even charismatic figures to lead a peaceful Revolution. Even people like Lafayette were in favour of the Revolution at the beginning.

We can see the Sync rate on the Router....

Therefore if you have buffering etc this is no longer a SYNC issue but THROUGHPUT, and speed tests are only one part of checking that.

We would need more evidence (especially as we have some tools in the router that help, and a lot more detailed analysis of the line that the consumer can get), this evidence would be Path pings (show latency and packet loss to specific points in network), we can run pathpings and speedtests from the port you are connected to into the network and out to the router.

We would also be looking at exactly what is connected to the device, too many times have I seen 'poor speed' then I check and nothing connected in wired mode, only wireless and the rate on the wireless is not only low, but showing errors, this means issue is Local (device to wifi) rather than network.

As another option, we can also have out own field engineers attend with their own kit, they plug into the test socket, run testing in wired mode with wifi disabled and see what happens, again just one of many tools we have available to us.

but for backhaul congestion on the actual network? any ISP will have a NOC that have realtime access to their interlinks, also the ability to switch off to a backup if it starts getting too busy.

But to iterate, the reason WHY ISPs prefer to run speedtests from their own sites, the details can be recorded on their profiles, so no need to waste time collating Excel etc (and run risk of getting 'doctored' results)

*Also it is rare for other sites to show different rates compared to ISP sites now, used to happen in past, but not so much now, infact not had a case where other sites show lower rates than our own in a few years",null,0,null,1434636656,null,0,1434637024,0,csap0oh,null,t3_3a9p8m,null,t1_csap0oh,null,t1_csaop9j,null,null,null,1437166654,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; The monarch and the monarchy are not the same thing

No, they are the same thing in different tenses. The monarch is the individual who has the right to run the [corporation-sole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_sole) called the monarchy. The monarchy is the role which has been occupied by numerous people over many hundreds of years and hence it is plural. The monarch is the individual occupying it currently (or within the context of a specific time frame if used in day to day speech). I.e. *""Queen Elizabeth is the monarch""* and *""Queen Elizabeth is part of the Monarchy""* both being correct and ""Queen Elizabeth is a monarchy"" being incorrect usage. 

&gt; Of course, if the Crown Estate was the private property of the Windsors, shouldn't it be subject to inheritance tax and controlled by them?

Certainly not, as set out precisely in the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984 and Inheritance Tax Act 1984. To quote one of numerous exceptions applied to the monarchy;

* *""If the building or any interest in it belongs to Her Majesty in right of the Crown or of the Duchy of Lancaster, or belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall or belongs to a Government department or is held for the purposes of a Government department...""*

Essentially the thought process is that our nation is structured thusly; The monarch is the sole individual who has the right to act as the head of the judiciary, the executive and the legislature. She however divests the actual operation of those powers to a parliament (with an incumbent government voted for by the people) who act on her behalf. In a sense there is no point the monarch paying tax - since they would in effect be paying tax to the operation of their own interests (the running of the state). 

As I mentioned in my original post you simply cannot divide the monarchy up into different parties. It's the whole purpose of a corporation sole. The individual is the role. Elizabeth Windsor **IS** the Queen, **IS** the Monarch. One and the same thing. You cannot divide her into a private individual with private wealth and a state apparatus with only ceremonial control over state wealth. The truth is the Crown estate is passed to parliament at the start of each new reign, and before that is signed it belongs to the Monarch.

&gt; Those two entities may belong to ""her majesty"", but she has no power over them, they just belong to the head of state as a matter of ceremony.

That's not actualyl correct. You are right to say she has no day to day power in the operation of Parliament except a ceremonial role. However, the Crown Estate **are** (or rather **were**) her property. Like all Monarchs Since (I think) James II she has suceded the Crown Estates **in exchange** for an annual stipend in peretuity (i.e. for the duration of that reign only). So, at the start of her reign, or the start of the next reign it would/could in theory be up to that monarch to do the same. They could of course choose not to - and in that case the land **would be** theirs to operate as they wish in the sense of any private property. In the 1700s and 1800s the same principle was applied to land owned by gentry by way of royal warrants. Essentially land owned by way of a decree, historical ownership or royal warrant became the private property of that individual when private land became a thing - before that land was effectively all owned by the monarch and awarded to various individuals by way of royal approval, and those individuals then divided up that land to portion out to the mere mortals that actually lived and worked on it. A sort of *de facto* ownership being converted into the modern sense of private property.",null,0,null,1434636725,null,0,1434637205,0,csap1ya,null,t3_3a25gi,null,t1_csap1ya,null,t1_csalxil,null,null,null,1437166685,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Fair enough, but I'd reckon by this point all the media coverage about his ""unsettlement"" and ""urge to win trophies"" is fairly evident to most if not all managers, especially those targeting him for their teams next season - it's hard to keep hold of someone who doesn't want to be there in the first place. I wouldn't call it lacking ambition, considering that.

&gt; but there is an ever so slight possibility of us winning something and improving as a team with him in it.

From the media coverage around the situation, I feel as though Sterling wants to leave for a club where he'd win silverware within the first season of his arrival, and a big piece, as in the League trophy or something extravagant. Considering the fact we got ever-so-close to the FA Cup, silverware is silverware - you take what you deserve, you feel?

Again, I am repeting myself, but there was a moderate phase, before the betraying of Louis XVI. 
*Of course* the different parties when Louis XVI was still around were staunchly opposed to each other. *It was a revolution*. But it doesn't mean in any way that they were at each other throats and that things could have only degenerate.

So while they were plenty of opposing parties, they were still listening to each other and trying to find a more or less peaceful way to resolve the conflict. 

I mean, yes the nobility wasn't happy to lose its privileges. But what's worse : accomodating the Revolution and accepting to be equal and paying taxes but being alive and finding a way to beneficiate from the new order ; or being slaughtered by the other 98% of the population who can't deal anymore with your bullshit ?
The nobility wasn't retarded, and understood that they needed to change in order to survive. And on the other side, the revolutionaries knew that the only real legitimity still came from the King, even if he would not reign alone anymore, his presence was indispensable.

So yes, while all parties were being angry at each other, things could totally have gone swiftly and the Kingdom could have been reformed without to much blood being shed.

But once the King has betrayed what can you do ? They could have tolerate the betrayal of a minor Lord, or even of a really important Lord.
But tolerating the betrayal of the King ? He is *the State itself* !

From that moment, yes, there wasn't any compromise possible anymore. The revolutionary could never trust the nobility, and the nobility had no more assurance that they would be spared, so refusing the reforms and fleeing the country or fight could totally be a better deal.",null,0,null,1434637624,null,0,1434802863,0,csapk6u,null,t3_3a9id1,null,t1_csapk6u,null,t1_csaovgi,null,null,null,1437167124,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

To see classical performances, I'm a bit spoilt here in Cambridge, because the colleges often have classical music events for extremely low entry fees (or free, in the case of listening to the organist/choir at Kings College for certain performances). I never take advantage of it anywhere near as much as I should. I guess for a wider reach, there's also the advent of cinemas broadcasting live performances of classical pieces/operas/ballets and so on, which surely has only served to make classical performances more accessible, not less. 


Personally, I like modern classical composers best - Rachmaninoff is about as 'traditional' classical as I get, as well as some great Americana from Gershwin. I LOVE Philip Glass and have done for years - I've been lucky enough to see him twice in the UK - so to answer your question, I enjoy classical pieces, but I still have preferences within the genre, as with any other genre of music.

null,false,whistdrive,null,null,null,"&gt;Jimmy Saville was molesting the terminally ill children.

And Asian sex gangs put guns to girls' heads, doused them with petrol and threatened to light it, held electric drills to their kneecaps, injected them with heroin, made them bleed. Saville was an absolute monster but the violence I'm reading about the Asian sex gangs literally makes me want to puke.

Let's look at what distinguishes the Asian gang problem and why omitting ethnicity when reporting on it only tells half the story:

1) The disproportionate representation compared to other ethnicities.

2) The fact that they network amongst their own group shows to what degree this attitude to child rape is prevalent among them. They network with family, friends; operate out of kebab shops; are known to taxi drivers, etc. White pedophiles have to use the 'deep web' for a reason: because they'd probably be stomped for suggesting raping kids to their cousins and coworkers.

3) The fact that they targeted other ethnicities, and even asked white girls to specifically find them more white girls to abuse. *The perpetrators made it about ethnicity*.

The men who control the economy are mostly white, so the men who destroyed it were too. Fails 1). *That's* why it's stupid to mention that they're white. 

The Catholic priests who abused match 2) in the sense they networked and were protected by their ingroup, and the Church hierarchy *was* demonised, quite rightly. If you haven't seen how much of a kneejerk reaction of 'pedo' there is to any discussion about Catholic priests, you've been living under a rock. Invalidates your point. 

&gt; The majority of serial killers are far and away white.

In the US that is actually completely false. Just an FYI.

&gt;You are blaming an entire group of people because you think the abuse reached a threshold where you can afford blame to every person of a specific allele pool and belief system without looking into how crime is created. 

I'm blaming their blatantly misogynistic culture and racism.

&gt;""Hey, is this Racist?"" That's all! That simple question asked to some helpful ""Brown People"" would have helped create a proper response to the start of these gangs and nipped them in the bud. 

You know what would have been even simpler? If all these Pakistanis who knew about this child rape and thought it was wrong just fucking came fucking forward and fucking reported it, but they didn't. The doctors and nurses around Saville *did*. *This is the whole fucking point: who in the Pakistani community stood up?* And if they had done, don't you think the police would have had their worries of looking racist assuaged?

&gt;The reason we saw Rotherham is the sort of poverty and alienation that's endemic to British Pakistanis leading to the formation of gangs and being seen as a separate group for more than 40 years

How are you going to talk about these special circumstances afflicting this specific ethnic group unless you *name the ethnic group and don't just label them as individuals*, even though that's what you keep carping on about--that they're not treated as individuals?. You're just confirming my point that it is an ethnic issue. And come on...

&gt;poverty and alienation

No.

Fill you in on what? I'm not sure what you're missing. This was the point where the police made a very public effort to investigate historical claims in a manner that suggested victims might actually be believed rather than told to shut up. In terms of the point I was making, reported incidents being on the rise with no cap on that rise being in sight, that strikes me as significant.

I haven't though, have I? Because the concern in question is whether one group or another abuses kids more than another. I call bullshit, but that the imbalance in reporting on the types of reporting that can and do happen lead people to believe that.

&gt; Stop worrying about looking racist.

I have no concerns with looking racist, thanks. I doubt many of the people in this thread are racist. The very notion that child abuse permeates every section of our society though has people going on a crusade and saying no, we must focus our attention here and on this.

Because it is a huge importance in football? Fans want to know how the club is being run, I don't see the problem in talking finances of the club. It gives you a better understanding in which players are coming in, going and how much is available to spend.

It's all well and good saying you want good players to come in. But if you don't look at the resources and see that sometimes it's impossible to bring them in, then you will be disappointed.

Plus selling Sterling isn't only about money. We could get rid of a 'cancer' in the dressing room as he clearly doesn't want to be here. Sterling has been poor the last few months, probably down to the contract situation and him wanting to leave.

null,false,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"This was a really helpful video to watch. I think a season playing out of his favoured position may be telling, but it's also food for thought as to whether he has the attributes to play the recent Gerrard role for us. I think not, at least, not in the next few years.

He's too aggressive to play that role. In fact, he may be groomed to play a regista but he's not got the ability for it now, though this can be improved obviously. His distribution is lacking - he isn't quite able to pull of a searching ball with space, and is more comfortable in the Wilshere role of making space in central positions with strong and aggressive runs. He's high-risk that way, much like Wilshere was a few years ago - losing position is a critical failure in those positions and horribly expose your back line. 

More crucially he doesn't seem to have the intelligence and patience for this position. His work rate and speed (relative to Gerrard) make him more able to aggressively play the quarterback role (more like Pirlo and Xavi) than Xabi and Gerrard. A regista, if you will. But that requires being able to control tempo and play team mates in. 

Now this isn't a criticism of Can - he's a great player and I think he's got bags of ability and potential. I just think he may be better suited in a Henderson type role rather than as a defensive playmaker and I'm concerned BR might already see him as a viable regista at this point. 

It's incredibly rare to find a player under 23-24 who can play this role: Xabi was 23 when we signed him. Pirlo was about 24 when Mazzone (at Brescia) first thought to use him as a deep-lying playmaker. Wilshere, Verratti, Pjanic and Kovacic have had error-strewn starts as playmakers of varying depth but in Wilshere, Pjanic and Verratti's cases they have teammates who can consistently make up for their errors and ensure that their positives shine. Will our players be able to do this for can?

Can may yet mature into it but while not fast, he is not as slow or physically unimposing as Xavi, Xabi and Pirlo, meaning he has largely bullied the lower age group teams (he has said as much himself) and thus this requires him to develop that game-reading side of his football brain which he hasn't had to rely on over the years. 

I feel that it would make more sense to abandon the deep-lying playmaker role altogether, and I do hope that BR intends to do this. This deeper midfielder should have clear defensive duties, be reliable on the ball, and be mobile - this doesn't mean an out-and-out destroyer like Lucas though. All our rivals recently had and have this player - Carrick/Herrera, Essien/Matic, Flamini/Coquelin, Fernando/Fernandinho, Sandro/Paulinho. 

Allen could do this for us but he lacks strength and bite in the tackle. Lucas lacks mobility. Can would do well here but he needs to improve his tackling and reading of the game so he doesn't bomb forward - while exciting to see, it is incredibly dangerous without clear coordination between the midfielders. Milner and Henderson probably can't play this role either despite being strong, mobile and good tacklers - it would waste their running, distribution and high press ability.

Can is a good problem to have, but am concerned he'll be thrown in the deep end too soon. He needs time but I am counting on him to be a great squad player next season when we need to inject energy and aggression into any match.",null,0,null,1434640304,null,0,1434647018,0,csar5l7,null,t3_3aa6rw,null,t1_csar5l7,null,t3_3aa6rw,null,null,null,1437168095,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

In terms of the point I was making, reported incidents being on the rise with no cap on that rise being in sight, that strikes me as significant. 

I just don't see how victims not being believed due to celebrity status and sexist attitudes in the 70s and 80s is related to victims not being believed due to their class and the perpetrators being left alone due to culturally-oversensitive social services and police. It seems like two separate issues being resolved in parallel--the change in Rotherham required wasn't to just to listen to the victims--but maybe you're right.

&gt;Because the concern in question is whether one group or another abuses kids more than another. I call bullshit, but that the imbalance in reporting on the types of reporting that can and do happen lead people to believe that.

I don't think the issue is exactly who molests more but why Asians are disproportionately represented in the particular issue of sex grooming gangs. Because if the police and social services weren't going after them because of fears of looking racist there's an easy fix with huge payoffs, and many will be left wondering why it wasn't done sooner.

Ok, so Wikipedia isn't the best - let's check a few others: [britishbattles.com](http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/waterloo-june-1815.htm) says 23k British, 44k allies and 74k French (no specific mention of Prussia so we don't know if they're counted in that ""allied"" number - probably not - but it seems the KGL are considered allied rather than British).

My next door neighbour's sister had a history of migranes.  She kept going back to the doctor for increasingly stronger painkillers, and was generally fobbed off as an attention seeker until after a number of years she ended up in hospital after a seizure.  They finally performed a scan and discovered a huge tumor in her brain.  They operated to remove it, but it left her a shadow of her former self-barely able to walk, let alone look after herself-and about 6 months later she died from meningitis.

The trouble is that once you've been diagnosed (rightly or wrongly) with a condition, finding any doctor who wants to revisit that diagnosis or treatment is nigh-on impossible.  I've seen this with my father, too, where he has, over time, been prescribed different medications, each of which has some side effect in blood chemistry, to the point that he ended up taking other drugs to combat that change... rather than revisiting the original prescription to see if a different drug with better side effects could be tried (thankfully this was eventually done).

It seems to me that medicine is largely composed of excellent technicians and techniques, surrounded by shocking process and procedure.  Lessons that were learned long ago in the airline industry, such as checklists and challenging authority, are actively shunned in medical environments.  Until this changes, we'll keep seeing cases such as this.

null,false,chinajack10,UnionFlag,'15 Street Triple RX,null,"I've had the Street Triple RX for a bit now and previously owned a GS500, GSXR600, Daytona 650 and a Speedmaster.

Indian Scout: My Speedmaster was a cruiser. These are not bikes to ride, more like bikes that people look, listen  comment about. It is nice when people admire your bike however riding is just another chore with no excitement. I would steer clear considering the other bikes on your list.

MT-09: A mate has one of these. He absolutely loves it. The only criticism he has is with the suspension. I thought he was being picky until I rode it, it feels like something you would expect from an NC700 or the likes. Other than that it is a great bike.

Ducati: Rich mans bike. Gorgeous and would have one just for the name and looks but would always refrain from riding in anything other than glorious sunshine.

Honda CB560F: I had one of these last year as a rental from Hunts in Manchester. It was okay. It had everything you need and IMHO it felt like a solid workhorse that would be great for commuting. I used it purely for leisure and it was fun but all you need to do is ride a Striple or the MT-09 and you will realise what I mean by being a commuter.

Striple: There is a difference between the standard, the R and the RX. I test rode an R which has upgraded suspension and a different from fork rake angle. I was told this alone is worth the extra asking price and took this as an obvious statement considering the price difference. I went for the RX which is really just the R with a Daytona rear end. It has a higher seating position but still with the upright seating position. I felt this was better as it allowed me to see that little bit more above cars in front of me. As an owner there are drawbacks to this bike. They are a theives favourite and extremely easy to disable just by ripping off the instrument cluster. They are light too. Very light, I think mine is 185kg wet. This is also a good thing where handling is concerned, it outshines all others on this list just for the handling quality. Suspension is fully adjustable, while not great it leaves the MT-09 whimpering. When I first got the bike I found myself turning into bends then having to come out again, readjust and then turn back in (this is due to how easy it is to manouvre this bike. So much fun. Quickshifter comes as standard on mine and is amazing, although does have me revving and staying in gears for longer than I really need to. I like the looks of the bug eye which I know is an area of debate but feel with the new low slung exhaust it rounds the bike off perfectly in the looks department (nobody will mistake this for anything else).

The triple engine is something to behold. An amazingly fun power delivery right through the power band and will have anybody smiling. It will also give litre bikes a good run for their money on track. Hopefully this is helpful as information from a Striple owner.",null,0,null,1434640713,null,0,false,0,csaretm,null,t3_3a3ptd,null,t1_csaretm,null,t3_3a3ptd,null,null,null,1437168123,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

null,false,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"What I mean is that Emre Can is not good enough for a club that wants to compete for the Premier League, however as I see it we are no where near competing for the title right now, and frankly I have a hard time seeing us compete for the top 4 without 2-3 very significant signings, that I have zero confidence we'll make or actually hit a good player on. In that case, i'm willing to drop a couple of points in the development of Emre Cans potential, because it won't matter. Thats pathetic for Liverpool Football Club, but its the situation we're in, Chelsea, City and Arsenal have way stronger squads than us, United probably does too, and we're about equal to Spurs, but have significant injury issues(Studge and Sakho being the most important IMO), and as you mentioned, what Can needs to improve is gametime.

When it comes to Cans position, I would also make the argument that its you and another commenter thats shoehorning him into a box to box midfielder, because for Leverkusen he played DM and LB the majority of the time, and as far as I know played DM at Bayern. 

I simply disagree that he was weak in the dual aspect, but maintain that his main problems were tactical aspects of the game, which is not uncommon for a 21 your old player who spent very little time getting first team football. Emre Cans strong ability on the ball and strength 1v1 situations were one of the main reasons the 352 worked so well for us, and worked so poorly when he was isolated with wingers who he couldn't control. The disciplin is an issue, but because we dont know his instructions, we can't evaluate that as well. Still, its easier to improve the mental aspects that create a whole new dimension to his play. Compared to Hendo, Can just doesnt hold up. Hendo has a much better ability to find the pass, i'd argue he is a better finisher and seems to be way better in finding the right positions. I think it'll be Hendo and Milner who will surround the opponents box, because they are much better at that than Can, who will most likely end up pushing forward into 3 opponents in tight space and end up losing the ball, instead of seeing the pass or shot. 

Another thing to consider is that we've never consistently played with a traditional DM under Rodgers. Even when Lucas has done it, its obvious that he has been given more offensive assignments that he has in the past and was told to push more forward. The DM under Rodgers seems to be a hybrid of the typical number 6 and the typical number 8, because of BRs offensive mindset. I can see Emre Can being perfect for that role because of his technical ability, and he sure is better offensively than Lucas. It just change the fact that he doesn't have the great long passing ability of Gerrard and Xabi Alonso, nor the short passing ability similar to some of the Arsenal CMs, and he is not a great danger when around the opponents box, despite scoring the goal of this thread. I just can't see him improving those areas enough to become a relevant CM. Vidal did it when he became one of the best players on the world, but my understanding is that with Pogbas rise, Vidal has player closer to Pirlo a little deeper, because thats we're his roots are. Similarly, Rodgers could put Gerrard back as the 6 to be his deep playmaker, but that still won't make Steven Gerrard a defensive midfielder.

The only reason I mentioned it was to make the point that what we know about scale, whether it's happening through grooming gangs or networks or in the home, is that really we know nothing.

null,false,awittyusername2014,null,null,null,"Union action is not the only reason for full automation. For starters, fully automated trains run to a much higher frequency, which is obviously desirable in a capacity stretched system. For example, Line 1 of the Paris Métro runs a train every 85 seconds, which is about 42 trains per hour. That's higher than any line on the Tube network has or is projected to get, even with better ATO and signalling enhancements.  
  
Consider also something like the Night Tube. It is difficult to get humans to work unsociable hours like this, as the article shows, and that makes it difficult to provide the optimal service. An automated train does not care what time of day it is, however. The main concern with regards to frequency of trains at these hours then becomes the time needed to take rolling stock out of service for routine maintenance.  
  
Relatedly, consider variations in demand. For instance, maybe because the World Cup is in a time zone that means England matches are likely to be on very late, we would expect demand for Tube services to be higher than normal in the late hours of the night/early hours in the morning than would otherwise be the case. TfL has to plan for this months in advance by agreeing rosters with the unions, covering a number of different scenarios. If demand ends up being higher than anticipated, it is practically impossible to increase service frequency to match in any reasonable time frame. With an automated system, this can be done almost instantaneously.  
  
Another positive is energy efficiency. An automated train can be programmed to be almost perfectly optimal with regards to efficiency, which is something no human driver could ever hope to match. Automating Line 1 of the Paris Métro resulted in a 15% increase in efficiency, for example. Admittedly, ATO (automatic train operation) provides similar results here, but even this limited form of automation is still sorely lacking in London.",null,0,null,1434642014,null,0,false,0,csas8zi,null,t3_3a9u7e,null,t1_csas8zi,null,t1_csaojeu,null,null,null,1437547311,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"Actually, if they were raping Asians exclusively the press would talk about a gang of racists. 

Not how all White People were racist. That's the difference. 

Actually, as stated some of the first victims who came forward were Asian and no one did anything. 

Specific circumstances? Okay Most British Pakistanis were blue collar workers brought over in the 1950's and 70s to operate the UK's industries on nights and weekends. Basically they didn't mind working shitty hours while the UK's workers wanted day shifts. When the UK's iNdustrial market fell, all of these guys were out of jobs. The UK moved to a service sector economy.  

People who were factory workers had a terrible time since they did not have the education to make the transition from an industrial to a service economy. Doubly so for the Pakistani Muslims, many of whom were educated in Urdu and Pashtun rather than English. Seconldy, there was racism. It made it WAY harder for them to get another job in the service industry particularly when white people who spoke english as a first language and often who had better education themselves were struggling. 

This resulted in more White people from those factories earning money that got them out of the slums while British Pakistanis didn't have that opportunity. In addition their ""night shift"" habit left them aliens as they couldn't really integrate. Not when everyone else was at work and they were asleep. So they were alienated and they were out of jobs and didn't have the same drive for education that the Indians who first came over did simply because we are comparing White Collar Doctors to Blue Collar Foundry Workers. Incidentally? Pakistani White Collar workers show similar demographics to Indians. High Education, Low Crime, High Taxes Paid... The problem is that they were in a minority compared to the bulk of workers brought over to feed Britain's Industrial complex. 

Incidentally that's why Muslims are seen in places like Manchester, Birmingham and indeed Rotherham which was a major producer of Iron and Steel. When the White People got Upwardly Mobile, the Muslims did not. And it isn't down to anything inherently flawed with Muslims since they came from the same culture as the Hindus who came as part of the NHS to be doctors. 

Poverty Breeds Crime. Alienation Breeds Crime. What we ended up with are areas dominated by Muslims because ""White People Got Rich and Moved Out"" while Muslims were prevented from doing so initially due to a lack of formal education and indeed racism. These resulted in young men who simply had no futures and no skills to get out of the poverty they were in because their parents didn't understand that the world changed. 

Dad didn't need to learn fancy quadratics to put food on the table. Why should I? 

All of that created a culture of crime. And created a sense of alienation. It's this alienation that works both ways. Asians are ""alien"" to you because (mainly Muslim British Pakistanis) they are poorer and they live in a ""ghetto"". But there is a less visible sort of Asian who doesn't do that so are ""invisible"". The British Indians are much much much richer and mainly upper middle class/rich and highly educated. 

So why don't they act the same? That simple difference in history. Even Muslims from India were more likely to have come as doctors and been alien to the Muslims who worked in forges. 

That's the reason for poverty and for the formation of criminal gangs and the alienation. IF we increase education and start mobilising Pakistani and Bangladeshi people into the workforce we would see a fall in all the ""negatives"" associated with Islam. 

Once the stereotype about them was that they were workaholics cause they worked the worst shifts. We can at least make them people who think TGIF (cause I got to go to the Mosque).

The best analogy I've been able to come up with so far (admittedly I'm sure it's not perfect) is slavery. I'm also not going to say that slavery is as extreme as wearing religious paraphernalia, but it's a similar philosophical process.

Slaves are forced by a master to do work for no pay. It has been ruled unlawful to own a slave or to force people to work for no pay. This is similar to being forced by someone to wear a specific item of clothing, or to wear specific religious paraphernalia. Governments use that power and force nowadays to stop that happening.

Now, I don't truly believe that when the slaves were freed in the United States, that every single slave immediatly left their owners and went to get paying jobs. I actually have no doubt that some slaves did not dislike their life. Work and activity is there, food and shelter is covered and assuming you have a caring owner then it might not be all that negative a lifestyle. All of this, if you're third generation slave onwards has been all you'd ever know. Especially when the alternative is a work market massively over saturated with recently freed slaves looking for things to do. I can imagine it took some time for all slaves to choose to do other things.

To not agree with any government control is to allow slavery to continue.",null,0,null,1434643288,null,0,false,0,csat3fg,null,t3_3a98ke,null,t1_csat3fg,null,t1_csarfwh,null,null,null,1437168764,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Looking out the debtor figures in [the accounts](http://www.scribd.com/doc/258474746/QPR-Holdings-limited-2014), Fernandes' people have 'outstanding' loans worth £125 million compared to the Mittals' £32 million. Of that mischievous £60 million write-off, 10% was the Mittals. Even with a third of the ownership they've only fronted a fifth of the money, if that means anything.

I'm not sure about Amit Bhatia as to me he just comes across as a bit of a playboy, safer with his concrete business, in which he can achieve business success a lot more securely.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Yvette, Stella, Tessa",null,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott#Political_career):

&gt;Abbott has a record of differing from some party policies, describing herself as the 'only candidate who listened and voted against the Iraq war', **opposing ID cards and campaigning against the renewal of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons**. **She has been seen as a ""maverick, a free-thinker, willing to rebel against the party machine"".**

&gt;[...]

&gt;**Abbott's speech on civil liberties, in the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008 won The Spectator magazine's ""Parliamentary Speech of the Year"" award and further recognition at the 2008 Human Rights awards.**

&gt;Abbott has served on a number of parliamentary committees on social and international issues. For most of the 1990s she also served on the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. She went on to serve on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

&gt;[...]

&gt;**She was given a score of 79% by Stonewall based on how she voted on all pro-gay rights legislation before Parliament between 2005 and 2010**. On 5 February 2013 MP Diane Abbott voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on same-sex marriage in Britain.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Following her move onto the front-bench, **the Telegraph said on 27 September 2011 that Abbott had ""become one of Labour’s best front bench performers**.

[...]

&gt;She was one of 16 signatories of an open letter to Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.

Please, tell me more about this 'vacuous moron'. I'd like to hear about how someone 'devoid of original thought' has been willing and able to rebel against the party line and make award-winning speeches while doing so -- from a right-wing paper, no less. I'd also be interested to hear more about the 'incompetence' that has led to her being praised by everyone from right-wing newspapers and magazines to liberal think-tanks and gay-rights pressure groups. Was it, I wonder, her 'fecklessness' that led to her [increasing her share of the vote ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_North_and_Stoke_Newington_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s) in the last two general elections in a seat she has held for nearly thirty years? Did you know that 'feckless' is a dog-whistle term used by racists to describe black people? I'm not saying you are a cross-burning racist. I am suggesting you need to think very carefully about your prejudices, as do we all.

The reason I made the joke about you not liking black women (which I should not have done, sorry) is that you have picked a black woman to illustrate your point even though she is not an example of your point, in that she was not selected using an All-Women Shortlist. All you demonstrate by pointing to her is that a) you don't know what you're talking about and/or b) that there can be 'vacuous morons' selected by any possible process and that, therefore, AWS aren't the problem. You have, in other words, *proven your opponents right* on several levels: As well as being unable to provide an actual example of a bad MP who was selected using AWS, you also had a kneejerk reaction against a black woman while claiming that we didn't need structures that prevented kneejerk reactions against black women. What's more, during your kneejerk reaction, you accidentally used a term used by racists to describe black people.

Now, we're all comrades here. We can have valid disagreements and this is one of them. I am not saying that 'you are a racist misogynist'. I am saying that society is racist and sexist, and that you, very unfortunately and certainly inadvertently, have reflected one aspect of that.

Germany allows foreigners to come there, do courses and not have to pay a penny and then stay there to work. They know that if they can get skilled workers with degrees it will contribute to their economy and people will usually stay there.

When non-EU foreign students come to the UK to go to university, and we send them away as soon as their degree is done it hurts us, its a brain drain that takes away when these people would likely stay and fulfil jobs we need fulfilled to add to the economy.

A house like this, closer to sutton (a nicer area) would sell for around £150-180k. But the people landlords have brought those from poor backgrounds into the area, which has in turn brought that area down.

I think this is it exactly. I think you've answered your own question. I mean, compared to other examples of automation tube driving is pretty generous in that a lot of our current trains just need the automation switch flicked and off they go. So the technology can be phased in, hiring can be phrased out and we can keep people working until retirement. Or re-skill them. That seems fair and ethical, I'm all for that.

But this is going to be an increasing problem for society. Automation is going to affect more and more fields. As I mentioned in another post we're on the brink of the huge disruption that will come from automated road vehicles. If you're a truck driver, bus driver, taxi driver, farmer, construction driver, all these roles risk vanishing or fundamentally changing within our lifetimes. Now in the long term vehicle automation is probably going to dramatically cut traffic accidents and pollution. It's probably undeniably a net good for society.

I work in IT, doing specifically Cloud Consulting. What that means is that we help companies move from physical servers to ones hosted by Amazon/Google/MS and they pay for their usage rather than owning them outright. They can also do cool things like automatically adding servers to deal with high traffic, and reducing them down to save money when it's quiet etc. 


My job involves various things, some pre-sales planning, advising clients how to do things, some implementation, lots of training, some travel (I just spent 3 weeks in Buffalo, NY for a project recently) if you want it and so on. It doesn't involve ANY out of hours or on call work, which is pretty rare for an IT job, and to me that is worth a lot. Some roles (ie, operations ones in vancouver or edinburgh offices do involve on call, I dont know much about that as i don't do it.)


I worked for about 10 years in more traditional IT jobs, support, development etc, before i moved to sysadmin work a few years back and looked after servers and was on call etc. I was starting to get a bit jaded from it, until I found this role at the start of 2015.


It's a growth sector, so my company is technically still a startup, but it's gone from 2 people to 150 in 6 countries worldwide in 6 years, which is pretty good going. Because it's a startup, the benefits are pretty good - the company takes us on short breaks twice a year for the quarterly updates (in march we went to Amsterdam for 3 days, in sept Mallorca for 4 days etc) - the office a kitchen full of drinks/snacks that we tear through every week, including beers on a Friday. Everyone gets a Macbook Pro to work from as we have a hot-desk policy. Working from home is also welcome - we do a lot of google hangout calls to keep in touch etc, and as we have offices worldwide, we often work with and sometimes have the option to travel to other countries.


In case anyone is interested, we have a ton of roles worldwide in Sales, HR, Finance, Management, Account Management as well as Engineers, Developers etc too - quite a few based in the Edinburgh or London offices. We also take graduates as well. For a full list of roles see [this link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/cloudreach?t=72uvka) Note that there are multiple openings per role - we have something like 60+ open positions right now, maybe more, and we are recruiting about 20 people a month, worldwide.


In case you dont want to take my word for it [here is the Glassdoor review page for Cloudreach](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Cloudreach-EI_IE439504.11,21.htm) - as you can see it's rated 4.5/5 - a pretty high score, and a pretty decent place to work!

firstly, any advice depends on how the property was purchased and whether there were any agreements about your respective shares.

The mortgage lender would be very unlikely to agree to change the names on the mortgage as it affects their ability to enforce their charge.

Assuming you own the property in equal shares and there are no other charges owing on the property the calculation of your share will be

(Current Value of house - ((mortgage)+legal costs))/2

If the agreement is to purchase your interest she will likely need to re-finance to provide sufficient capital for your interest and to take a mortgage in the property in the name of her and her new partner.

You will need very fact-specific advice about your options but, in short, she will not be able to deal with the property except with your consent or by court order.

Hope that helps!

Edit - to clarify, I'm unsure from your original post whether you mean that the property is owned through shared ownership in which case consent of the Housing Association will also need to be sought.

We are a long way away from the days when strikes were used to obtain serious change or improvement, rather than used repeatedly for nest feathering

&gt; Oh no! They want more money for being asked to do more work! Those cunts! Take away their rights!!

The point was that it wasn't really any extra work, but demanded more money anyway, knowing that the government is not going to let them strike during a crucial event for the country

Most people would be happy with reasonable overtime pay for any extra hours worked, not hundred or thousand pound ""bonuses"" with further payments on top

He's right. Most MPs are voted in or out on national swings. You could put a sack of potatoes up in Scotland at the moment and get an SNP MP.

&gt;It's a fallacy though. You can make parliaments more representative I'm sure... but ultimately there will always be differences between politicians and their voters. Instead, the British parliamentary democracy works by having representation in the sense that you as an individual are represented in parliament by a specific individual. The bottom line is that an individual is accountable to you. It's a microcosm of democracy and it shouldn't be underestimated. Let's think of two examples;

Your examples are broken is a candidate in what is now arguably a Conservative safe seat. His election to office could probably be mostly accounted for in national swings, as was Ed Ball's defeat as he did not sit in a safe seat but a marginal. Same goes for almost every MP in Scotland.

&gt;People who talk so much about electoral reform almost entirely seem to be coming from the left, and it's worth pointing out that the people who would have lost our under a more representative system would have been the SNP and Lib dems. The real winners by a long shot would have been UKIP and with boundary reform the conservatives. 

The Liberal Democrats would have close to 50 seats under a proportional system. The SNP would have less though.

Conservatives wouldn't have a majority but UKIP would gain massively.

&gt;So CGP goes some way to address that with these preferences for other ""proportional"" systems... but the problem with these is you tend to end up with a ""least dislikable"" candidate, or the path of most agreement. In essence it's running government by committee and it doesn't always work as well as you'd hope it would - as we've seen with these technocratic administrations springing up. Parliament ends up being replaced by a group of boring grey-people who struggle to communicate their ideas, and can be very difficult to take radical action as all their ideas have to be subjected to a process of broad consensus. 

Given the general personality of our current politicians how is that any different than what we have now? Parties in power tend to do the least offensive things (at least publicly) anyway for fear of not causing outright hatred in the electorate and sowing discontent in their party.

&gt;and can be very difficult to take radical action as all their ideas have to be subjected to a process of broad consensus.

I was lucky enough to get a place at Bangor university studying what I love - music - on a course that focuses mainly on the western classical traditions but still has room for me to focus on my main interests. From A level music I had a small interest in classical music and started to listen to it for recreational purposes on classic fm, but I was really interested in its incorporation with heavy metal, film scores and video game scores. Now I treat it just as I would with any other form of music, however whenever I'm with my parents my mother does not like listening to it, in fact it's quite like being the rebellious son playing death metal in the car but instead it's classic fm.

I have been really surprised though with the popularity of classical music with university students, it seems as though if you have been able to get into uni you're the kind of person who can appreciate it even if you don't listen to it, although most students do. My uni does have a strong focus on contemporary classical music which is difficult enough for music students to listen to never mind ones from other schools, however fortunately I do like the contemporary stuff after repeat exposure.

I'm sorry for the un-organised mess that this is but I have so many thoughts and I think that you've asked a really intriguing question.

* People who are in uni are more accepting of everything 

* The amount of people going to uni is increasing at an exponential rate regardless of class or monetary situation

When you think about it, there isn't much more about this story that isn't summed up by that one line. Is Sterling a greedy 20 year old who thinks he should be earning £150k a week, or his Aidy Ward an agent who thought the best way to get his name out there would be to advise Sterling (a hot property in the world of youth football) to disagree to the figures being offered because he was *worth more*? 

I know which side I'm hedging my bets on. Whether Sterling has fallen out with Rodgers or not, he should still be able to recognise what Rodgers and Liverpool have done for him up to this time -- we've given him first team football and helped his development.

I'd like to see him stay at the club beyond this summer...but with the caveat that he should only be here because he wants to be, not because we're forcing him.

Personally I don't think he's that bad, but he doesn't add much either. So aquiring more Joe Allens doesn't forward our team much, and it might be anoying to watch, I agree. But it does give us some more depth, which is what was lacking big time this season!

A hospital consultant salary is not usually 6 figures.  It starts at about £75,000 and will get to six figures pretty late on in their careers.

&gt; I can't believe people are even defending this behaviour. This woman was genuinely ill with real symptoms.

I haven't been able to find her symptoms.  Do you know what they are?  Without knowing, it's difficult to understand what the thought process might have been and consequently it's hard to say how unreasonable they were.

We also don't really know how she was being monitored.  This type of cancer recurs frequently and so, the medical team will have probably been monitoring with annual MRIs or CTs^[1].  If that's the case, she's very likely to have had imaging in the period when she highlighted a potential recurrence (they're often done annually).  If she complained of abdominal pain, but had normal imaging and blood tests, then the team would have probably been right to continue with normal follow-up.  If they weren't monitoring, or if she turned up jaundiced with a 6-month history of severe weight-loss it would be quite a different matter.  We also don't know how the cancer was treated and the extent of the resection which would be nice to know. Of course the Trust can't discuss the details of her care and they're no one is going to go into the technical aspects of this in the papers.

As usual there's enough information to feed an impressionable, baying mob, but not enough to actually make an make an educated guess as to whether the management was at all reasonable.  In hindsight, they obviously got it wrong, but these things are a lot easier when you know the outcome.

What's really the issue here is the tone of the communication, which is undesirable.  If someone has a chronic illness, or a rare disease, it's quite likely they're going to know a fair amount about it.  The way to handle it is to have an open discussion about any misconceptions you may think the person has and to keep an open mind if they disagree with you.

I too think that Can is a little on the slow side regarding the right option. But I would be inclined to believe that it's more to do with his age rather than anything.

I've mentioned before but I'll mention it again. There's a reason why at Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Germany U21 and at Liverpool he has been used in the back 4. It's because he's damn well good playing at the back. He's strong. He's not fast, but players with stocky builds like him take 2-3 seconds before reaching top speed and when he's on the ball, he's not getting knocked off it. 

The problem is that his reading of the game at midfield is lacking a bit. At RB and at CB, where he's a cog in the back 4, it's not so much a problem. Reading the game isn't that important unless you have Messi and Suarez tag-teaming you. In other words, it's easier to read the game, especially with long time servants like Skrtel and Sakho guiding you, in the back 4. But at Midfield, he's a little slow. 

The way I see it is that he can become a good midfielder. One good enough for Liverpool. But he can become even better at CB. The only thing suspect is his heading, but that can be worked upon and it's not a massive deficiency.

Even Kolo mentioned it. ""He has been playing outstandingly at the back and in midfield he is a very strong player. We like him here."" Kolo knows where Can's strengths lie.

But it's up to Can to make the decision. And all signs point that he wants the midfield role.

Obviously not all of them, but I would imagine that a significant proportion do (I am sure that we all have anecdotes relating to elderly relatives), and will vote accordingly. 

It shouldn't be accepted. The voting double standard that is. The thing is that with the Scottish referendum, younger people were more likely to vote for independence, which the SNP wanted. So they pushed for it. Westminster probably don't want to be under pressure to lower the voting age for the general election.

Northumberland has several villages on FTTP although I think it's still a fairly low percentage.

My favorite VDV goal was one he scored against Blackburn. He was in the box and Walker cut the ball back to him from the byline down the right. VDV finished the chance in the most elegant way possible...opened up his body and merely redirected it into the bottom left corner.

He's scored more spectacular goals (in fact he scored a curling shot from outside the box in the same match) but for me that one summed him up. Could have finished it a number of easier ways but he did it as stylishly as he could.

Yes, it's cheaper, it's faster to deploy, but it is a very short term bodge that will require something better to happen. I think FTTC &gt; FTTpole &gt; FTTP is going to cost more and take longer overall. But it looks good for the shareholders. I suspect that in a few years time BT will be back at with the begging bowl for more cash for the next bodge.

In my own village in Cornwall they've been incredibly arbitrary. My street is FTTC. 30 seconds away, they did FTTP (same conditions - overhead wiring, there's an existing copper cabinet, no reason not to do FTTC). I've seen places where half the street is on FTTC and the other half on FTTP.

BT is at risk of repeating the same thing again with their half-baked fibre to the pole idea, where the economics make even less sense. It'll provide very good speeds, but as it's a brand new technology it'll be expensive, and it's more complex (FTTP doesn't need electronics in the street, fibre to the pole will) - and to do it you have to run fibre to the pole anyway, which is the most expensive thing to do.

Bear in mind though that BT's predictions are usually fairly conservative. You'll possibly get more than 12 but not a lot more.

I've encountered players like him before and I know that all of this isn't solely Sterling's fault. With Ward setting up a new business, which he needs funding to do so, he's clearly whispering into Sterling's ear about all of this.

I hope he doesn't become a Jack Rodwell, I don't think he will because he's a great player with huge potential. But advisers like Ward don't care about Sterling's development. He cares about the money. There's no need to take such a risk in moving to another club at a tender age, especially when Liverpool is giving him everything to perform.

Naturally, our MPs won't want to sit in their offices all day, so we shall put in an enclosed courtyard so they may get some fresh air. Security is still important, though, so it shall be surrounded with walls 30 feet high, 3 feet thick, topped with spikes and with CCTV cameras on every corner.

I was trying to up my game with being frugal. Was looking into foraging as I've been known to hunt shrooms in the autumn and figured I'd see if I could expand on this in any sort of practical way. One thing that kept coming up that can be eaten and is plentiful is the nettle and as its abundant and easily identified I thought fuck it I'll give it a go.


Picked a bucket full and found a recipe from river cottage website and got cracking making some nettle soup. Preparation is hard and you will need gloves but once you get the nack it's just like any other veg. The recipe is pretty much potatoe and leek soup but with nettles, I expected it to be like a bush tucker trial and a tough eat (proving a point to my gf) but oh my good god was I wrong, it's amazing and if you feel you have the inclination I urge you to try it for yourself.

The frugal thing was my starting point and it's not gonna save you any money (unless you grow spuds) but it is honestly delicious and your never likely to feel more irish. I went out and picked enough to keep and freeze that will prob last me the winter.

Cornwall is very good as far as what BT has done locally compared to the rest of the country. Up to 1/3rd FTTP availability in some parts, and the council has just signed a deal to extend ""superfast"" to 95% coverage. I've seen FTTP in the literal middle of nowhere and in busy town centres. I have FTTC and a relatively good line so I get pretty good speeds, http://www.speedtest.net/result/4442418655.png

There's also a fair bit of non-BT competition as I understand it, mostly through the fibre network that the local electricity company owns and rents out to other telcos, and companies like Level3 claim they have PoPs in places like Truro (population 20,000), which seems dubious but that's what they say

It's a lot better than it was even 5 years ago, where most people could only get ADSL from an ISP using BT Wholesale, which meant data caps and contention issues that BT took a long time to fix.

I don't know how he was at Leverkusen (he played CM and LB) and for the U21s (he played LB a few times there for them), but he has been pretty poor as a RB. As a stopper (Skrtel's usual role in a back 4), he can step up and press the opposition or the ball without worrying about being beaten or leaving a hole. 1-on-1, he has been suspect as both a RB and a CB, letting players get past him. Against Stoke, Palace, Hull, he was poor to average when defending his man, allowing players to get past him too easily. I don't think speed is an issue - he's quicker than average, much like Yaya Toure - deceptively fast and his strength means he doesn't always need to be fast*er* to beat players. It's the same with Gerrard - lots of people were convinced he could eventually play CB as he got older, but he can't. Gerrard is inherently a risky player. He's not a percentage point player like Xabi and Xavi, where the 95%+ pass and dribble completion stats actually mean something massive for the team and the way it plays. They're rocks you can build your defensive third shape around when you have the ball. 

I think his best position is in midfield. The only concern is that right now he's a bit like Henderson - physically sound, good work rate, lots of aggression, but no individual end product, defensively, in transition or offensively. He really needs to develop one facet of his game heavily. Does he become a box-to-box player with good finishing and occupying opposition mids? Does he become a destroyer? Does he play like Joe Allen and recycle the ball to keep things ticking over? BR and he need to decide and focus on all that - he isn't going to wake up tomorrow and already be a complete midfielders, he needs to focus his training and to play a fixed role in the team.

If, on the other hand, you want to chastise him for not recognizing what Liverpool have done for him (although QPR fans could have a similar gripe) or for thinking that he's better than he actually is by wanting to play for a side like city, that would make a lot more sense to me.

null,false,theboyliam,null,null,null,"This is a really personal account of my experience with the Love Activists. Apologies in advance for anyone who makes it right the way through as it's hugely waffly, but I just wanted to share this with some intelligent people (I.e. Not the comments section of an Echo article).

I live in the building directly opposite the bank building the love activists occupied. When they first moved in I was interested and thought the idea of it being used as a food bank was really great, but almost straight away was put off by all of the stoopid Guy Fawkes masks and anarchist banners.

I could see from day one of their occupation that they had graffitied the interior walls of the property. I understand that this isn't a big deal to many as it can be painted over, but it seemed a little needless and it was obviously going to lead people (designated love activist members or not!) to graffiti other parts of the building. I think this was an oversight for the activists and something they really need to take responsibility for.

As I type this I realise how over the top it sounds, but the three weeks that they were in the bank building were among the most miserable of my life.

I had kind of braced myself for some level of disturbance, but it ended up being way more than I could handle. Towards the end of the occupation they played music constantly throughout the day and into the night (usually until around 9 or 10ish in the evening), and would use megaphones to shout at people walking by on the street. It doesn't sound like a huge deal, but when you live in a small flat with nowhere to escape from the noise it's unbearable.

An 85 year old lady lives in our building and her flat also faces onto Castle Street. She suffers with a heart condition, and so I ended up feeling more sorry for her, as I was able to go into work during the day, but she would be stuck at home with the noise.

I ended up contacting the activists on dozens of occasions about the noise, at first on Facebook and by texting one of the activists. They were really reasonable for the first two weeks or so, and although it was a bit of a pain having to remind them to quieten down, they would usually take care of the noise pretty quickly.

Towards the end of the occupation (and definitely during the whole time after the police stopped allowing people into the building), then the occupiers seemed to stop caring about us. I remember on a couple of occasions they would make screeching noises by waiving a microphone in front of a speaker so as to try and annoy the police outside of the building. 

The noise coming from the bank (be it music or use of megaphones) was almost always totally unnecessary, it was the equivalent of a teenage boy driving through town with his windows down and stereo turned up to max. The activists were making noise to get a message across, it was just to show off and it made my life hell.

It was at this point that I would go out on the street to try and speak to them as they stopped replying to Facebook messages. I would ask them to keep the noise down, and explain my position and also that of my elderly neighbour. I was brushed off by them telling that the guys inside the building would have a ""meeting"" about the noise, but the noise would continue.

Around the second week of their occupation I suffered a shingles outbreak (it's like having chicken pox but loads nastier), and everything I can find on the net seems to say it's caused by stress. I was feeling pretty sorry for myself and just wanted to curl up in a ball and sleep. I was still having to work pretty crazy hours in work, while also trying to recover from shingles. It was pretty grim not being able to stay in the flat to chill out and being in near constant pain. I started fantasising about throwing water balloons or using a super soaker to try and break their speakers. I never quite had the courage to do that, but I was getting increasingly worked up about it all.

This next bit is all speculation... But while the love activists were in the bank one of the purple wheelie bins used by my flat went missing from the street outside (I thought that at time that one of the guys in the bank must have taken it as they had no where to put their rubbish, but that may be me being super paranoid/ Daily Mail letters page about it). My bin bags were taken out of the bins and left on the street. The council went through the bin bags, found my name and address and are now trying to fine me £80 for littering.

I'm not sure how I would feel about the Love Activists if none of the above had happened. Im sure I'd be supportive of the can-do attitude involved in sheltering and feeding the homeless, but then there are already people who do that without begging for attention.

I feel that there are undoubtedly many good, if naive souls, involved with the Love Activists. I hope they can find an outlet for that humanitarianism while being mindful and respectful of their surroundings and those around them.

&gt; I do not agree. Representing your country at a national level no matter what age bracket is still an awesome achievement. I am not sure anyone would get to that stage with all the coaching and competition without having the talent or ability (especially with Germany's massive talent pool at the moment). As for club level I still stand by my point. Liverpool players even reserves/youth have to have some talent/promise and they are yes Liverpool players non the less.

In the UK this means a science degree, and you learn the relevant parts of the law (UK, EU patent, trade mark etc. intellectual property law) during your first few years on the job, with exams until you are fully qualified. In the US, as a comparison you have to have degrees in both law and science to be able to practice as a patent attorney.

As far as physics is concerned, I work with mechanical inventions (factory machinery, cranes, screws etc), electronics (amplifiers, semiconductor physics etc) and also computer systems and telecomms, so how much physics is actually applied varies quite a lot.

2) Patent attorney firms have quite a nice and fun (I found) way to get in. Standard CV and cover letter, and some firms will also ask you to send in a short description of an every day object or item, e.g. a lock. Then there's an interview or two where they ask you more of the same kind of thing.

Consider the Court of Appeal's judgement in Bristol Conservatives Ltd v Conservatives Custom Built Ltd [1989] RPC 455, which dealt with a similar situation: ""...it would not matter that there was no allegation that there would be any confusion in the minds of the public. The concept of confusion is irrelevant when the misrepresentation leaves no room for confusion.""

Damages are assessed on the damage to goodwill, particularly since you will have paid the seller for the coffee. Even if you were to argue the damages should be minimal, the other party would probably succeed in obtaining an injunction and an order that you pay their legal costs.

The benefit that Sterling would have a place like city is that he most likely would not be ""an integral part"" of their success. He could be played when on form, and replaced by someone of similar quality when not. This would then relieve a significant amount of pressure that he probably feels right now at Liverpool.

Oh but they can roll over those bonds forever. 

Until they can't. Greece couldn't. Oh but we can print money! 

Or those debts 1/3 are index linked so you can't inflate them away. Note that we had a small government bond auction failure in 2009. So what did the government do it printed money. Which sapped peoples' purchasing power.

null,false,spiz,null,null,null,"The Telegraph's article has some more details.  Of course, to come to an exact answer you need exact timings of scans and things and that's what a court/GMC will establish.  

Doyne was apparently being followed-up with 6-monthly scans after her operation in December 2011.  That means she'll have had a scan in mid-2012 and another in late 2012/early 2013.  The Telegraph's story is sketchy here, because it says her GP advised her to go the A&amp;E since she was feeling unwell (this would have been in January 2013) *and* says the tumour was discovered after she chased up an MRI (we don't know how long she waited to chase up, so we don't know if there was an unreasonable delay here).  This means she may have had another scan.

From the information in the article, we can glean that was cancer free in about mid-2012.  For at least a couple of months after that, you'd be reassured by negative scan.  Now, she either complained of being unwell soon before her next routine scan and scanned then, or complained soon after and had another scan.  Either way, by then the cancer was bad.  

Off hand, 6-monthly follow-up seems reasonable in itself.  If the cancer went from being microscopic (and consequently symptom-free) to being inoperable within 6 months, then it must have been very aggressive and it seems difficult to imagine they could have detected the cancer much earlier.  There's always the possibility that the Trust dropped the ball at some point (missed diagnosis, ineffective communication between departments), but then it's likely that this would have been the main complaint.

edit:

&gt;  What's really required is that the medics should be able to have an adult conversation with her about her symptoms. If your suppositions are correct, then her consultant could have said all that to her in a 15 minute conversation.

That's about right.  Sometimes these situations are difficult and patients and families may hear what they would like rather than what is actually said.  There's also often a lot of anger about, irrespective of the performance of the medical team.  This makes communication by the medical team all the more important and may need well over 15 minutes (my longest single chat clocked in at over 1 hour).",null,0,null,1434653236,null,0,1434654174,0,csb0036,null,t3_3aa66h,null,t1_csb0036,null,t1_csayjly,null,null,null,1437172576,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Whenever I've seen software type things it's quite often a lot of algorithms and flowcharts to describe how to control stuff.

Remember that there will have to be 200-300 workers on site armed with powertools and other pointy objects. There will be dozens of trucks and vans coming in every day with big bulk loads of cement mix or plaster mix, machinery such as lifts or vents, tens of thousands of miles of new cabling, *gas cylinders*, and other supplies.

Well how do you know that this load of cement mix isn't a fertiliser bomb, that these cables aren't detonating cord, that these cylinders won't be wheeled into the sitting chamber and used to take out all of Britain's senior politicians at PMQs. It's a lot of checking and double-checking.

Say a specialist electrician gets injured. You can't just replace him, you have to stop that job until another guy can have the psychological and criminal background checks and vetting from the security services until you can trust him to walk around with knives, cable ties and gaffer tape. So a couple of hours of delay turns into a week.

The Olympics was pretty fast work. Then the police sealed off each venue, dismissed the workers while they ran the bomb dogs through every inch, then placed the venues into security lockdown until the end of the games. Which added time to each day, plus the half-day lost during the bomb search.

Parliament is patrolled by sniffer dogs every day. It'll take ages before you can even let the workers into the building. And once inside, each team will have a specific zone they must stay within. So that means they can't move from A-B, they have to go the long way round. And they can't just go do another job on site when they're done, because they don't have the red passes they have the blue ones...

Its a tough thing, but as owners of the football club, want to trust them to do the right thing whether we agree with them or not.

You can see it already in supermarkets in the last 5 years, not every till is self service yet, the technology still needs to be perfected, but what you can see is 1, maybe 2 employees looking after 10-20 tills, rather than needing that many employees on a 1:1 basis with the customers. Once the technology is perfected I can't imagine the need for many employees on the till, aside from helping less able bodied people.

It obviously sucks for these people, but I can't see businesses not going down that route.

My final bit of advice would be to just apply for contracts and go to job interviews in order to get your name out there - even if you don't think you'll get the job.

You never know who you will meet, and you can always leave the interview after having a discussion about possible *future* work with that employer.

The main thing is to leave them with a good impression.

Since then, two main rules are in effect that limit players and their agents from upsetting the apple cart during the season by pushing for immediate transfers when things aren't going well for them or the team. 

The first is that players can only be registered during the two FA-determined domestic windows (summer and winter). The second is that a player cannot be registered and play for more than 3 clubs during a single season (including on loan). This means moves are more ""permanent"" (to minimise clubs arranging complicated transfers).  

The window comes with pros and cons obviously, issues still exist but on the whole, the stability of squads has increased as all business must be completed during the two windows each season.

To your question specifically, you can ""sign"" players whenever you like but they can only be *registered* during the windows. Registration basically means that the player has officially joined your squad and can be named in competitive matches. We can agree to sign a player in March, but it will be ""completed"" when the summer transfer window opens.

I also quite like the EDAs, but I think they only realm work as a whole because some of them aren't great. 
*The Infinity Doctors* is a very good read. It's almost carefree in terms of canon-restrictions if you are comparing it to the telly programme. But it's concepts and ideas are really interesting, with an interesting story set against it.
*Transit* **might** be a favourite but I'm also on two sides of the fence if it went just a bit too far into the dark and edginess that the Virgin NAs was trying for.

I've been at that company for 2 years now and I love it - I'm still not sure if merchandising is the perfect fit for me, but I seem to be pretty good at it and I *love* the people I work with. Working a job with people you like instead of people you just tolerate makes a world of difference.

Digital merchandising revolves around product - we write the copy, brief the studio on what shots need to be taken, and basically try to come up with the best way to make the customer buy our stuff. I'm working on a big upsell project at the moment - it went live a day ago and in its first day we saw an extra £9k of sales. It is so awesome to see your efforts make such an immediate impact.

Unfortunately, with the football economics these days the club will always be at a disadvantage against others with the wages that they're willing to provide. Because of that, I think negotiations and the handling of the contracts are super delicate. Agents are motherfucking vultures when the time is right and no question that they're keeping an eye out on Liverpool with the talent that's there.

Sinclair and Oji both under the age of 19 so will be interesting to see what the club has planned for them. Hopefully, the club can get some strong players this window so that we can afford to send them out on loan to proper clubs for their footballing education.

Still optimistic, but definitely rough right now.

ibe is extremely young. i don't hold too much weight on him or or markovich at this stage of their careers to be honest, but i wouldn't mind bringing in a firmino or someone even a little older to hold the fort down for a few years (konoplyanka?). let these guys develop until 22-23 and then let them run free. of course, if ibe is ready next year, he's ready. if marko is ready, let him run free...these guys are all incredible talents, it would really be something if our team just clicked next year. i think now that jones, glenjo and stevie are gone, with rickie pretty much out the door, the average age of the squad is going to be like 23.2 years old or something ludicrous like that. if that group clicks together this year, wins a trophy and makes top 4, we will be in excellent shape. a lot of this hinges on danny sturridge too, if he can stay healthy enough to bang in 20-25 goals this season for us, i can see coutinho, hendo and milner all banging in 20 goals between them and having ibe, marko, ings, and origi all smashing another 20-25 between them. maybe wishful thinking, but having one player like danny to bang in the goals on a weekly basis is massive. have danny boy play in only the prem, don't play him in cups, and just get his body right weekly. give him 3 bloody days off in between games if that's going to keep him healthy. he's our best player when healthy, he makes us tick.

But I really didn't know what I wanted to do at University, so went for my 'favourite' subject (English), and tried to do English Literature at Aberystwyth University. I lasted one term.

Then I tried a wildcard, and applied for Archaeology at the University of York. I really enjoyed most of the subject, except the digging and stuff! I lasted just over a year and a half.

Then I was unemployed for a year, close to suicide and with really nasty depression. On a whim I applied for a Business Administration Apprenticeship role with my Local Council. I needed the money, and I honestly didn't know what else to do.

I got in, and have spent the last two years doing a wide variety of administrative and office stuff across two big departments. Holy shit I love office work! It's so relaxing and structured, and everything makes sense to me. 

Back in September I moved to a new department, an Adult Education service, which had a big portion of employability related support courses. I was brought onto do some administration for one of their courses.. within a  month I was helping to teach employability to unemployed 18 - 24 year olds. Being unemployed myself and having faced a lot of the same challenges, AND being of the same age as the clients meant I **totally** connected with them all! 

I quickly progressed to doing one-to-one support meetings with learners, needs assessments, giving advice on careers and health support to members of the public, and doing a lot of advocacy work on behalf of my clients to other services.

A few weeks ago I signed a contract for a six month placement to do employability and support related stuff full time, **across the entire region**. I'm now seriously considering going into some kind of support worker role in the future. I'm working towards getting my NVQ Level 3 in Information, Advice, and Guidance qualification (having just completed my NVQ Level 2 in Business Administration).

Holy shit I didn't expect to be in this position three years ago, as a twice-University dropout with severe mental illness. Helping people gives me such a good feeling inside, and I relish every challenge and every success. It's been an amazing and humbling experience.

Student loans are easily the cheapest loan you will ever have - and if you're good with money (and won't spend it), easily the best option for access to cheap money you'll ever have in your life. If you don't need it to live on, take it, invest it, and don't be in a hurry to pay it back. You've got a healthy chunk of cheap money to use as, say, towards a deposit on a house.

Sixteen year olds remain children, we still live with our parents, have to go to school, etcetera. People at this age just aren't interested in politics, don't know or care about the political decision making that shapes their lives, and, in my opinion, aren't going to be until the decisions they make effect them more than the will of their parents. I'm still a child, I still act as a child does, so does my entire age bracket, and as children, we don't have the freedom, independence or ability to comprehend how the decisions we make could well and truly affect how we are governed. Furthering the notion of dependency, any adult, whose right to go wherever he wants within the confines of the law rests firmly in his hands, is the master of his own destiny, and thus, can go vote at any election because that is what he has chosen to do - and this, because there is no higher authority telling him he can't. A sixteen year old who wants to go to the polling station, if his parents won't let him leave the house, as is their right, is essentially barred from expressing his political will. That doesn't seem fair to me: If we're not entitled to freedom of movement, because we're to young for it to be safe, how can we argue that we merit the right to vote? (And this isn't me advocating freedom of movement for minors).

Also, I have yet to see among my age group, anyone whose political view varied in a meaningful way from those of their parents. If you give the right to vote to an entire age bracket that still lives with their parents, who have never had the opportunity to form their own opinions based on their prior experiences and the consideration of fact, you'll essentially just be adding a million teenage ballots  which mirror whatever their parents have been spewing. Do you really expect a 16 year old, whose parents hate the conservative party for example, and love labour, ever having the exposure to the alternative sources necessary to vote for anything other than Labour? And vice-versa? I honestly don't think so.

What I do believe though, is that there should be increased political awareness among youths. More opportunities to discover what kind of system regiments our way of life, and whether or not we agree with the current state of affairs. Schools should provide information to youths, tell us what is the latest bill being passed through the House of Commons, what are the main points of government policy, who are the main members of the Cabinet, what are their roles, what do they do? How can we get involved? 

Well this is just one boy's opinion. If you asked most of us if we wanted the vote, we would probably say yes. But if you asked us if we wanted to be allowed to drink, or smoke, we would say exactly the same thing.

&gt; Where do you end up if you ""follow the money"" though? Is there anyone who benefits financially in a situation like this?

Usually you end up at a manager or two who wants to look good for promotion or other reasons and can write a nice little report about all the money he or she has saved.  Often their is an incentive attached to certain amounts of savings paid at year end.   

We aren't talking about front line staff here.  We're talking about their managers.  As far as the GP side goes, is there any paperwork the GP has to do?  Any additional leg work?

There wasn't any philosophical or religious reason for doing so. Simply, as soon as I passed 18 and the last taboo of drinking wore off, I found myself saying those infamous words that everyone has mindlessly uttered; ""I'm never drinking again"". However unlike a lot of people, I actually thought about it and concluded that I didn't really like the taste of alcohol, didn't really enjoy being drunk and *really* didn't enjoy the nuclear hangovers I seem to be afflicted with, so why do I even bother with it? So begun about 11-12 years of being completely 100% teetotal. To be honest, I didn't miss it for a second for that whole time.

However recently, I discovered Kopparburg about 8 months ago, and revelled in the fact that I discovered an alcoholic drink I enjoyed! Baby steps later, I enjoyed drinking until I was a bit drunk, then half-cut, then drunk. From then, I tried champagne and discovered I really enjoyed that too (trust me to fall for the expensive stuff) and more than that, I could get drunk on it and wake up without *any* trace of a hangover. As in, literally nothing. 

A few weeks ago, I tried a sample of my wife's red wine, and to my utter astonishment, my most hated alcoholic drink was suddenly delicious to me!

So in 12 years, I went from drinking because it was slightly edgy due to being under-age, to going completely teetotal, to rediscovering alcohol, to enjoying some of the finer examples. It's been an interesting journey, but I can completely sympathise with that 20%.

Bender would be a dream in midfield. We really need a defensive midfielder to defend the back four and break up attacks. Bender could do that really well. I'd prefer him to Imbula because French DMs don't ever work for us, it seems.

Montero is another player I'd like. I feel like he could be good competition to Chadli. He's pretty quick, which means he could offer something different to Chadli. However if Poch sees Pritchard as a LM, I'd rather not get Montero.

Austin is the final player I want. With QPR relegated, he will probably want to leave. I feel like he could score a lot for us, and be good competition for Kane. He's also fairly similar in style, so we wouldn't have to change our game plan for him.

We cant even make it into the best European competition for fuck sake, thats one thing that pisses me off massively.

We can't get by on history alone, we need to start winning trophies - until then players with top potential will leave - just like Suarez, Torres and now Sterling. Yes, Sterling is probably too young to be saying we can't match his ambition - but I don't think he's being disrespectful to the club. If the kid wants to leave to win things, then looking at the past decade at our club - he aint going to win anything anytime soon. The right thing for Sterling is to obviously stay and develop here - but while he's doing that developing there's less chance of him winning stuff than with other teams. It kills me to say that, but imo its the cold hard truth.

null,false,BlackMuntu,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"With the EWTD, in principle you're limited to 48 hours/week averaged over six months, but in practice you'll end up doing a bit more. Most of my days are normal days (9-5 or similar) with the occasional 12-hour day thrown in (average of about once a week), the occasional 36-hour weekend (long days Fri-Sun, average of once a month), and maybe two sets of three or four twelve-hour nightshifts in any four month period. The intensity varies depending on what rotation you're on.

My current rotation is probably moderate intensity compared to some of the other jobs I've worked, although I understand the intensity of FY1 rotas has been dialled back a little since I did it, so my experience of Foundation will almost certainly not be representative of what you'll do. The busiest jobs I've done were probably general surgery in FY1 (long days on call about once a week, frequent long weekends on call, 7-day stretches of hellish nightshifts) and A+E in FY2 (expect to have breakfast at 4pm often; your friends and family will be asleep when you're free to hang out).

Currently a consultant physician in the specialty I'm going into can expect to work into the evening, then remain untroubled most nights overnight when on call (typically around one day/weekend in twelve in a lot of places), but a combination of training changes, under-recruitment and government pressure means I will probably end up doing a similar job on the acute medicine shop floor into the evening and night as an on call consultant as the registrars do now. The routine work the rest of the time will probably remain an 8-6ish, Mon-Fri job.

If lifestyle is what you're looking for (and I'm assuming you mean lifestyle outside work), I'd strongly advise against acute medicine or emergency medicine. Again, the same pressures toward a consultant-delivered (rather than consultant-supervised) service and terrible recruitment in emergency medicine for various reasons mean it is almost inevitable that you will be working nightshifts into your late 50s as an emergency physician. The acute physicians get to share the on call rota with the general physicians, so you may get away with a less intense job as an acute medic.

If OP is on the maximum student loan of £6259 (according to SFE that figure is from anyway) that's £4200 a year gone out of that - leaving a total of £171.58 per month for everything else he/she needs to buy - food, social events, public transport, uni trips, nights out.

You really should find out - the mortgage company should give you a statement every year. Let's assume that you've paid off £1000 of the principle for each of the 3 years, so the debt is down to £67k.

So, your equity in the property is currently £84k - £67k = £17,000. You own a 50% share, so the *minimum* you should expect to get when she buys you out is half of that - £8500. I suspect (IANAL) that this is all you would get if you got a court order and forced the property to be sold, and the proceeds shared.

You've contributed £6000 + £360 x 24 = £12,240, while she's contributed £360 x 12 = £4320. You've made 74% of the contributions, so the *maximum* that you can argue for is 74% of the equity, which is £12580. (3 years is quite a short time, so I think it's reasonable to ignore the fact that your contributions all pre-date hers.)

It's up to you &amp; her to negotiate a figure somewhere between £8500 &amp; £12580. She'll offer you the lower figure, you ask for the higher figure. If you can't agree, then you have a couple of legal options that should encourage her to see things your way...

1. It is illegal for her to deny you access to the property. If she's changed the locks, then she *must* give you a key. Once you have access to the property, then you can signal your intention to move back in...

2. You can apply to the court for the property to be sold and the proceeds divided. You'll both lose out financially, because of the estate agent &amp; solicitor's fees, but she's the one who will have to find somewhere else to live...

How you play these cards is up to you. I presume that you no longer have good relations, since she's changed the locks. Perhaps a simple way to proceed would be to get a solicitor to write her a letter, spelling out how awkward you could make things for her, and offer to settle for a reasonable sum - say £10,500 - mid-way between the two figures?

Of course, if she (or her new boyfriend) don't *have* ten grand, then you'd be wasting your time. You might as well get the ball rolling to force the sale.",null,0,null,1434661746,null,0,1434664406,0,csb5rfr,null,t3_3aa9lo,null,t1_csb5rfr,null,t1_csb1mtf,null,null,null,1437175910,null,3,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,3,null

The common term for this is pet self-insurance and there's plenty of information online. It's especially a good idea if you're looking to cover more than one pet, rather than taking out multiple policies. However bare in mind long term illnesses in pets can rack up much higher costs, and pet insurance covers third party issues (such as being sued for your dog biting someone, or causing a car accident).

My issue with crowdfunding is the removal of risk of starting a business from the owner/s. What consequences do the owners face for running a business in a terrible manner and losing everything? Nothing. Aside from time invested. The risk is purely with the investors, who in turn for receiving all the risk receive no equity or share of profits. Having to convince a lender that you have a market is not a negative. The lenders confidence is a validity check that you have a sustainable long term business.

Raising the required amount of capital from crowdfunding is not itself proof of a sustainable market. For this or any other venture to be successful it will likely need far more customers than have invested.

I did a LL.B. at the University of Edinburgh, where I got a Desmond (2.2.). This was followed by the Postgraduate Diploma in Professional Legal Practice. I graduated into what was at the time a really dreadful job market. I toyed with the idea of re-training as an accountant, before realising that I didn't enjoy accountancy at all. I then moved to a succession of very junior legal jobs, before landing my current one.

Public sector legal work is very varied, and the work of a trainee is even more so. At the moment, my time is split between Planning Law and Corporate Governance. I provide advice to planners on areas of planning law, get involved with the decision making process and argue our case on appeal. On the governance side of things, I help to legally monitor our politicians, ensuring that their decisions are legally sound. 

The public sector has its upsides and downsides. I get a decent pension plan, good holiday time, flexi-time and work a 37 hour week. On the downside, my pay is low (I took a fairly big pay cut to get this job) and budgets keep getting squeezed.

Well that deepens my sympathy for them. They're doing a job which makes strike action very unfavourable. They're workers with rights just like the rest of us. But because they've chosen to work on the public transport system of our massively congested capital city whenever they do fight for their rights they suffer abuse for it.

All things considered, the history of the area isn't particularly impressive to anybody outside of the region. Many people in Netherton, for example, enjoy bragging about *the chain* of the -anchor- of the Titanic being made there. **Wowww**, I'm sure people across the globe have questioned where it came from. They reminisce about days that they didn't experience; about a period where life was even harder, living conditions even worse, and when work more labourious than it is today.

Dudley and Sandwell, albeit with pockets of nice areas, are complete industrial dumps. I live on the border between both areas and frequent Dudley, Sandwell and Birmingham. I challenge anybody to find a nice view on the train between Stourbridge and Snow Hill. There is nothing here that turns heads in a positive way. Nothing that attracts students, academics and investors from overseas to come to the western side of the **west midlands combined authority**. I mean, Dudley can't even find a tenant for the tower block in the middle of town. The people who opposed the shift towards the cosmopolitan, actual world-class* behemoth that Birmingham is are just shooting themselves in both feet as far as the future of the area is concerned. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city#GaWC_study the study *is* mostly arbitrary, but to be put in the same league as Lyon, Panama City, Abu Dhabi, San Diego is far better than *being twinned with Fort William*.

**Yes, I am aware that the areas have distinctly different histories, accents and cultures to Birmingham**. Some towns of yesteryear *were* more wealthy and prosperous, but with the decline of industry in the UK the area slumped, and sadly never adapted with the times.

 Living here, it seriously does feel as if nobody wants to actually achieve anything with themselves. People seem to settle for less than they're worth, leading simple lives and standing out from absolutely nobody. People go on about *community spirit* but when it comes to showing this, nobody actually cares. For instance, there is an overwhelming lack of opposition to the racist right-wing extremist groups marching through Dudley over the last few months. For an area that apparently takes pride in its multicultural population it damn well doesn't show it. Distancing yourself from a chance at recognition and success is just adding another nail in your coffin.

To most people this is just another name, but to me personally it's a bloody failure. It was a chance at becoming something other than the laughing stock of the country, a complete rebranding. A chance lost due to frankly undeserved pride and insecurity..

It's like you're asking that any time anyone mentions the KKK they have to come up with a bunch of excuses for its existence: lawlessness, carpetbaggers, poor whites in economic competiton with free blacks--whatever--when the reality is that it's brought up to show how racist whites in the South must have been for such a group to flourish. 

At best, being 'poor and alienated' is a factor for grooming gangs to sprout up but it's definitely not a sufficient reason in itself. That's where Islamic culture comes into play. We're not talking about economic crimes here; we're talking about violent sexism and racism, people who viewed white and Indian girls as less than their own.

&gt;Actually, if they were raping Asians exclusively the press would talk about a gang of racists.

&gt;Not how all White People were racist. That's the difference. 

If whites were committing sex grooming offenses disproportionately more--like if they were 98% of it? And if loads of whites knew about it but turned a blind eye out of ethnic solidarity? They would say racism among whites at large allowed that to exist. 

There's a certain class of pedo that's almost exclusively white--it's the kind that networks in secrecy with other pedos. It's not a bunch of guys at a fish and chip shop and their cousins, known to and protected by the community by a conspiracy of silence. That's why it's on the Pakistani community to speak up, which is what some Pakistani community leaders have been asking for, albeit too late. Treating them as individuals just ignores the problem.

&gt;IF we increase education and start mobilising Pakistani and Bangladeshi people into the workforce we would see a fall in all the ""negatives"" associated with Islam.

You could be right about his development but, the two things I disagree slightly in terms of Sterling's development is 

a) I think he would get way more playing time than is conventionally assumed by our supporters at City. Navas played 42 matches this season of which he started about 30. That's a lot of playing time for a pretty crappy player haha

&amp;nbsp;

b) Playing less at a better club but  having more competition/better training  can be beneficial to development. E.g. Henderson coming here, versus staying at QPR Sunderland learning of Gerrard.  

Why I'm particularly concerned ultimately though is similar to Suarez we're underestimating a players contribution because he's leaving. I'm not sure how often you were on the sub but when Suarez left, most people were saying it's fine, we have Sturrdige/ we played amazing when Suarez was banned at the beginning of the season, we'll play amazing without him.
