I tend to wear summer gloves every day unless it's really cold, and they'll last a year. I tend to buy new ones in early summer once I've torn the old ones to pieces putting them on wet hands. My winter gloves turned five years old last winter (Rukka Mars) and looked unworn until I put them on an exhaust pipe...

My £100 AlpineStars boots that I bought when I first got a bike didn't last long, and then nor did the ~£100 TCXs I replaced them with. I last summer replaced a three-year-old pair of TCX Infinities which had worn through the sole with a pair of TCX X-Deserts, and they're looking really tatty already, so I'm not sure this is an upgrade...

I've never yet worn out a jacket per se, just got bored of how non-waterproof it is. I've had my latest, a mesh Dainese one for two years now and aside from replacing the zip it barely even looks used and I guess I'll get at least that again out of it. I wear a normal gore-tex jacket over it for waterproofing now.

I've five or six pairs of trousers at a time and they last differently well depending on how much I like them.

But, answering your question, two years of basically-every-day-use is about what I'd expect from bike stuff, I'd be happy with more than that and a bit disappointed with less, I think.

Yes, because of its minority. There was a huge swing to the Conservatives in the 2010 election and there was never any reason to doubt that it would continue into 2015 - their majority might even have been bigger if they had had an election in 2011 or something instead.

Absolutely and from all evidence the Tories seem to think everyone has money, they're just not using it properly, i.e. to pay for food instead of using it to get more money.

They are drastically out of touch with just how bad it is to live month to month on a wage and how little opportunity there is to save anything at all these days. They think that by making it easier to become a property owner (at the expense of raised rents) that they're helping more people gain wealth, when in reality the vast majority of people can't even afford to think about Right to Buy because they're already getting screwed so badly. Many people have no savings at all and those are the people that are most disadvantaged by increasing rent under this scheme.

The only people this is benefiting are those who either saved back in the 80's and 90's when house prices were much lower, wages were higher, jobs were easier to come by and university was still free.

The crop of current candidates is a joke. One very old school leftie, and 3 vapid Blair clones all running for a party that's like a ship lost at sea.

Corbyn until about 2017/18, by which time hopefully Labour will have some direction, then a hatchet job for a new face at the helm. Hopefully Labour will have accepted that none of the three they currently have are viable, and go for someone like Jarvis. 

While I'll still vote to the right, I think that imperative that we have an opposition, and with the demise of the LibDems the only option is Labour, but with little to rely on in Scotland, they have an uphill battle.



There's one other factor that makes me think Corbyn might struggle to win a GE, and that's his age. He'll be almost 71 at the next election, which, I believe, would make him the oldest PM to take office for the first time.

It's gradual change but when we look at the best in the world - Denmark and the Netherlands - separation of people on bikes and people in vehicles is crucial for mass cycling to happen. It's a political rather than an engineering challenge (although there are plenty of god awful highway engineers who don't have a clue about cycling) but the newer routes are slightly better. 

It's also important to realise that experienced cyclists, desensitised to the hazards of cycling in the UK, who are fast, competent and assertive will never make up more than 2% of the population. So in order to get the other 98% off their arses, out of cars and out of diabetes clinics, we have to build dedicated infrastructure. Just the way it is.

Before you were VAT registered the EU company was charging you VAT because the place of supply rules state that if electronic services are being provided to a private individual (or non-VAT registered individual) then the VAT rate is charged at the  recipients rate, in this case 20%.

Now that you are registered for VAT, the rules now change. The EU company can now zero rate this transaction providing you give them your VAT number.

However, you must account for this on your VAT return as well using the reverse charge mechanism. This is where you calculate 20% of the service you bought then put it in box 1 (tax due to HMRC) then you put the same amount in box 4 (tax due to you) creating a nil tax position. This can also be referred to tax shifting.

**THIS ONLY APPLIES WHEN YOU BUY SERVICES FROM VAT REGISTERED BUSINESSES FROM THE EU.**

There is a public notice on this topic called 741a: place of supply of services. Specifically section 18.

It might be worth asking an accountant about this because it is a very technical and complicated area.

&gt;Success for radical policies in Venezuela is being achieved by providing for the poorest, liberating resources, but above all by popular education and involvement.

&gt;In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country.[143][144][145] The shortages included, and may still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour.[146] Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued further plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution.[147][148]

No one's expecting exclusive use, though traffic gets held up all the time - by traffic, and this taxi driver needed to understand that yes, skaters and cyclists use the roads too, and sometimes you just need to accept they are part of your delay (the entirety of this delay being around 1 minute). 

Furthermore - this is a legal procession (much like a funeral procession), meaning they have right of way over all other vehicles on the road barring emergency services. It's also a possibility they have legal powers to stop traffic, which depends on police approval through a community safety accreditation scheme, but I'd argue they didn't exercise or require those powers in this video.

I do have sympathy for Taxi drivers though, the kind of shit they constantly see on the roads. Driving around London all the time isn't something I'd wish on anyone.

I can see Burnham or Cooper as Labour Leader and then PM, I'd most certainly vote for Labour in the election under them... Unless the same thing as last election happens again with the candidate dropping out and the replacement being a wet fish º_º

I also like Corbyn but I feel he's a little too late to come and change things, after the country being under Blair, Brown and Cameron, it'll be too much of a change to effectively go back in time with some of his policies and he'll end up scuppering Labour's chances in the 2020 election.

One thing that did strike me at the last election is how similar the outcomes were intended from the policies outlined in manifestos between the Tories and Labour, if Labour didn't have Ed at the helm but rather his brother, David, I reckon Labour would be in now.

&gt; The word socialism covers a very diverse set of currents of thought and political movements, whose common goal is to be socially and economically more just. The original goal of socialism is to obtain social equality, or at least a reduction of inequality. More broadly...

Just because we're not sticking a flag in the ground and claiming the country belongs to us doesn't mean we aren't using our ""soft power"" to financially pressure countries into adopting policies that are favourable for us and unfavourable to the majority of their population. A corrupt African leader is very profitable for the West, we literally have huge incentives to keep shitty people in power.

Since I'm getting pretty tired of this conversation I'm going to try and explain how this works.

Firstly you need a friendly person in power. So you support a suitable candidate in their elections, giving them campaign advice, discrediting their opponents, support them financially etc.

Once they're in power you lend them a few billion. Doesn't matter what they do with that money, actually it's best that they shove it in their back pocket. You know, someone like Mobutu Sese Seko who was supported by the US government and built a giant fucking palace in the Jungle with a private airport big enough to land a concorde. He was in office until 1997 by the way. And the country still has guerilla fighters trying to overthrow the still corrupt government as a result.

So now you have someone who owes you a few billion. Hey, buddy, we need that money back now. Oh? You can't repay us? Hey, don't worry about it. If you pass these laws, we can just forget about it, yeah? Ok cool. Just give us all of your oil fields, subcontract all of your construction through these firms, oh and we'll have the mines too. Oh and make sure you pass really shitty labour laws, we don't want to pay workers very much, hurts our profit margins you see. Oh and you have to use our security too. Thanks friend.

Now you can get away with taking as many resources as you want for very little compensation. When anyone points out that the people aren't benefiting you blame it on the corrupt government. Or that black people are inferior, or religion is to blame, or tribalism or whatever bullshit I've seen so far in this comments section.

BUT wait! There's more! What if, for example, the people weren't particularly impressed with the shitty corrupt government imposed on them by the West, and elects their own leader that actually gives a shit about them? Don't worry fam, just use the media to discredit them, call them a terrorist, say they kill their own people. Then either assassinate them or use ""democracy"" or ""terrorism"" as an excuse to kill them, overthrown them, arm rebel groups, or otherwise topple them from power.",null,1,null,1439562246,null,null,false,0,cu2sbu2,null,t3_3gy1r2,null,null,null,t1_cu2rf6j,null,null,null,1441246713,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I doubt that, short of a major fuck-up by the Tories, that any of the candidates will win in 2020. However Corbyn *will* divide the party, and will make them appear to be the reincarnation of the 1970's views, or maybe a more mainstream version of Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party.

That will be an image that will take a generation to shift, as the more moderate/centrist folks in Labour will abandon ship as Corbyn's followers are *very* vocal (look at this sub; we've got people saying the MPs who regret voting for him are literally ""traitors"" and anyone saying voting for him will be bad are genuinely ""committing blackmail"". It's a huge circlejerk where anything other than blind worship is disallowed). The moderates will say ""fuck this for a game of soldiers"" and leave Labour to the Corbyn-diehards.

At least with one of the others, they'll lose but will be able to bounce back the next time. With Corbyn and the damage he (and his believers) do to the party, there will be no bouncing back for a long time. That gives the Tories free-reign for many many years.

I've read part of your first link and found this:   

*""The same consumer rights rules apply to second-hand and sale goods from shops. They must be of satisfactory quality and, if they're faulty, you can return them.""* I assume by return them, it means you are allowed a refund? And from what Trading Standards have told me, if the goods are faulty I have a right to return them and get a refund. 

Would the judge, if it went to court, not grant a full refund given that no reasonable person would expect a £400 scooter to break down on first use only 7-10 days after purchase? Even second hand, that's not a reasonable amount of time for the price we paid. 

The reason I'm reluctant to accept a new battery is because 1) the guy lied to us several times on 3 separate occasions. How can I trust that he'd give us a new battery given we were lied to about the newness of the original battery? 2) he's stated in his letter that he will only give us a 50% reduction in the cost of a new battery and stated ""but only if it is the battery which is faulty"". He hasn't said what he will do, if anything, if the battery is found to not be the problem so I can't rely on him to fix it (at no cost) or refund us. And 3), he hasn't responded to at least one of our letters, and it looks like he may not respond to our Letter before Court either as he's had 2 weeks now and we've heard nothing. Surely a judge would not look favorably on him for ignoring our attempts to resolve the issue outside of the courts?  

I don't think I'm being unreasonable to reject a 50% reduction when I've only just paid £400 out. If I bought say a laptop from Currys or Asda or another large, known store, for £400, and the first time I turned it on it died after 10 minutes on a full battery, I'd expect to be able to return it and get a full refund. And I have done such with faulty items in the past. From what I have been told, this is no different if the goods are bought second hand from a small retailer.

Meh. I don't know. I can't predict what a judge will think I guess I'll just have to hope that if it does go to court, they would be able to understand my point of view. 

Edit: typos and such. Oh, forgot to ask. If a judge did only give us a new battery and not a full refund, would we still get our court costs back or not?

However third world debt arose because of a very real need for capital in developing countries, and as sovereign nations they took the rational course in getting loans from the IMF / World Bank / etc. It wasn't because super-secret spies like John Perkins tricked them all with his white-man business talk. 

Now I'm no fan of structural adjustment policies, they are as I'm sure you'll agree responsible for a lot of the poverty in Africa today. However that's not a result of British colonialism, it's a result of the largely American neo-liberal dogma. I don't advocate it whatsoever and that's why I believe we should be (and are) embarking on debt cancellation more recently. Third world debt has been reduced pretty significantly as a result - with provisions including fighting corruption and promoting democracy.

Here, anyone not parroting the message of worship of the Lord and Saviour is shouted down and is downvoted to oblivion. I've even been speaking to people who have genuinely described (with no hint of irony) the MPs who regret voting for him as ""traitors"". I've also spoken to some others who have described others saying they'll leave Labour if Corbyn wins as ""blackmailing"". Hell, even look at this specific post! It's an interesting article (regardless of whether you agree or not) but because it doesn't pander to the echo-chamber the believers of JC live in, it's been downvoted to 0.

Unfortunately, it's like this with literally every other political community. The fringe, whom believe they are morally righteous, shout the loudest and refuse to allow any dissenting views (as is the case here). The more moderates find this impossible to have any civilised debate (as none can exist unless it's agreeing with the hive-mind) and leave. This means the main demographic remaining are the fringe.

I had this issue recently, so can offer a possible solution.
Because of money laundering laws, banks in UK will generally not open an account for you without proof of UK address.


However, there is an exception to his (the only one I know of, at least). Some banks have a department specifically made for people who come to work from abroad, usually called 'global employee banking' (I happened to use HSBC, but I think NatWest also has one). You email/phone them up and explain that you need an account as a foreigner working in UK.

The bank then uses the address from your country of origin (the one in your ID) and it needs to be further backed up by your employer - they will release an official company paper (it should be a signed/dated/logo paper) saying you work for them and they guarantee for your declared address.

Once you get the account you can change the address at anytime.

It really depends on where you are located, what you enjoy learning and how much you want to get paid. I am an aerospace engineer ( it’s very close to a mechanical engineering degree) First of your starting salary will vary depending on the company you start working with but you will definitely get paid more as a computer engineer. For example a typical starting salary here in the USA for a mechanical engineer is $60,000-$70,000 while for a computer eng it will be around $100,000-$110,000. Now also think about what you enjoy learning about. Engineering is a tough degree so you must enjoy what you’re learning otherwise it can be very hard to get through.  In mechanical engineering you will learn a lot of math, physics, material properties, stress-strain, fluid flow, heat transfer, and controls. While in computer eng you may have to specify between hardware and software. Hardware deals with the actual components of a computer while software deals with coding and applications. In the end every engineering degree comes down to optimization (making whatever it is your working on better) while driving down cost for your company. If you have any other questions feel free to shoot me a PM. In the end any engineering degree is great to start a career in just make sure you find the one that fits your talents and you enjoy.

null,null,oleg_d,,I don't have a bike,null,"In addition to the SV650S mentioned above, the Hornet/Bandit/Fazer are all good choices. They all sing from the same design hymn sheet in that they take a fairly sporty engines and cram it into a cheap'n'cheerful frame with ergonomics that favour comfort (relatively speaking) over outright performance.

If I were you I'd budget at least £500 for gear, of which you should look at dropping at £2-300 on a helmet. A truly comfy helmet makes rides infinitely more pleasant and should last you five years or so barring accidents - my Shoei Raid 2 only just started to show its age at that point and I do around 12k a year in all weathers. 

The same applies to jackets, but there's much less risk in getting a secondhand jacket from a born-again biker who bought a ton of expensive gear only to realise he doesn't actually like riding. Depending on your fatness you're likely to straddle a medium/large for most brands. You can pick up a barely worn textile jacket from a reputable manufacturer on eBay for about £40. Avoid the nice-looking no-name Chinese jackets for about £60 or so because the stitching and overall material quality tends to be dire. Triumph in particular do some nice jackets that often seem to show up second-hand for relatively little.

I can't speak much to trousers because I've never found a decent pair. I generally ride in comfy, thick jeans and keep a pair of cheap plastic waterproof overtrousers under the seat for when it rains. I also have a £30 pair of winter overtrousers from Lidl for when it's truly cold and/or unpleasant.

Boots - again, I can't speak with any degree of authority because I've been wearing the same pair of TCX Infinitys for the past five years. Before that I had some expensive sporty Sidi boots which were fairly unpleasant to walk around in and only lasted a couple of years.

I suppose the tl,dr of this is don't skimp out on your gear. Much like how your tyres are the only part of the bike that contacts the road, your gear is the only bit that contacts you. The right gear can make all the difference between an enjoyable ride and a decidedly uncomfortable one, particuarly if you decide to go away for the weekend.

Back to bikes, any of the above is great and at 5'8 you should have no trouble flat-footing on them, which is vital for confidence. They also all have half-faired variants which you should consider; while they are all much uglier than the naked models (with the exception of the first-gen SV650S which is a thing of beauty) the wind and rain protection they afford you will turn motorway riding from being something you dread into something at least halfway tolerable.

This Cum Hoq argument shows a complete misunderstanding of what was going on in 1983 and blames everything on one simplistic cause rather than analysing for instance, that the Labour party had just suffered a massive split with many heavy-hitters leaving for the SDP, at the same time as Thatcher was the most popular she'd ever been after the recent victory of the Falklands War.",null,0,null,1439567260,null,null,false,0,cu2vfml,null,t3_3gzdiy,null,null,null,t3_3gzdiy,null,null,null,1441248177,null,6,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

So fucking what. Are all things women do beyond reproach now, because women were historically oppressed in some way? Get off.

&gt;Yep Does his viewpoint demand that they stay out of his way lest he be offended by ""the tits""?

Yeah so? That's his lookout if he gets offended by something that most people aren't. He's not compelling women to avoid him.

&gt;You only find it funny cause you don't have to pay the price. It's not you who has to feed your kid in a toilet (cause that's hygienic).

How quick you are to allow your sexist preconceptions to manifest themselves in prejudice. I don't find Dyke particularly funny, and I fully support breastfeeding in public. 

&gt;And he voices the opinion of people who have helped ensure lower rates of breast feeding across the world. He's not in a vacuum. 

Again, so? There's nothing wrong with him expressing his opinion. His opinion is outdated and on a downward trend. Expressing one's opinion doesn't warrant a character assassination to end his career. 

&gt;And it's a viewpoint that kills. There are quantifiable deaths and ill health due to this viewpoint and due to the fact that there are women who feel embarrassed to feed in front of people due to the lack of acceptance. 

Great. Ring up the BBC and tell them that on their next discussion about breastfeeding. Fortunately for you, that opinion is a Correct Opinion so you don't have to exercise prior-restraint (unlike those with Incorrect Opinions like the right to smoke in public, or to not see women's exposed breasts). Let's hope you're always on the right side of history.

&gt;He's a genuine sizeable voice of opposiition to women who are often told that they cannot feed babies in public because these twats (cause most other people don't seem to have a problem) will get offended. 

You're onto something here. There's a sizeable crowd of people who have dated and unscientific and arguably harmful views on breastfeeding. Lets lambaste them into silence and ultimately into hiding so their thoughts can never be properly aired. What is this, *Rhetoric for Tantrum Throwing Children* or something?

&gt;And he's on the BBC's platform. It's not his platform, he's hired to represent the BBC and the BBC have a right to fire him for making them look like dicks through association with him. 

Yeah sure, and kill off any sense of respectability around the BBC by turning it into a Safe Space echo chamber where no one's views are ever challenged.

I'm part Native American so my hair is dark and very straight. I wore it down to the middle of my back in college. There was a televised football game coming up (I went to FSU back in the good days...) and I wanted to try to get some TV time. So I shaved both sides of my head and made a really tall mohawk and painted each side the school colors, garnet and gold. When I woke up the next morning I had forgotten about what I had done, saw my hair in a putrid mess, and shaved the rest off, thinking all the while I would just have a long wait ahead of me to regrow it. A couple weeks later after it had come in a little I didn;t like the fuzziness it gave my appearance, so I shaved it down again. A few weeks later, same thing. A couple more weeks and I realized just how convenient, and awesome, it was having it shaved. No maintenance, no products to worry about, no bed head, no hat head, and bad hair days, etc., just gloriously smooth shaved head every day. I never looked back, and haven't regretted a single minute of it. I can't imagine having to deal with hair now. Sometimes I shave it clean with a razor, but mostly I just use really tight clippers every week or so.

null,null,TheWoodElf,null,null,null,"Hi, I recently went through the same process as you so may be able to provide some info.
Finding and buying a car (with cash/card) is very easy and straightforward and as others have said, you should do it through a sales company.

However, the most important and nasty aspect about owning a car in UK is the insurance.

UK car insurance is crazy. There seem to be no rules or logic around the kind of 'offers' you will get from insurance companies, but the main idea is: it will be very expensive and you need to pay attention to all the rules.

First, insurance types. I'm a rather conservative driver and I tend to not get in any accidents. This is why, when I initially got here, I thought I'll just get the '3rd party' insurance, which is the minimum legal in UK anyway. In other countries is usually the cheapest - because it only pays whoever/whatever you hit, when you are the one responsible. By contrast, 'Comprehensive' insurance is the one that covers your entire vehicle as well as potential damage you caused, so, naturally, you'd think that was more expensive (and it is, in the rest of the world).
Well, not in UK it isn't. Here 3rd party will usually be more expensive than comprehensive! No explanations given. Expect prices between £700 and £1500 /year (sadly, that's not a joke).


Second, the value of your car doesn't seem to matter when getting a price quote! What matters is how big/powerful the engine is, how young you are, where you live/commute and how many years of claim-free you got so far.


Third thing is insurance ownership. For some bizzare reason, in UK the insurance is done on the driver+car+place. Meaning, you will get an insurance on THAT car, in YOUR name only and they need to know exactly WHERE it will be parked (at night). 
You need to have a friend/spouse/relative driving it from time to time? You need to put that person in the insurance (it will go up, naturally). 
You had a drink and want to give your car to another sober friend? You're risking both police fines and refusal to cover, if you somehow get into an accident on the way. 
You moved and/or got a different type of parking place? Need to call your insurance company and tell them about the changes, otherwise you risk refusal of coverage. Expect a price raise if/when you do.

Consider all these things before buying a car, even a small, used one, as you might have to spend a lot more on insurance and taxes than the actual car.


There are two advices I can give you to make your life easier:

1. Call the insurance company(s) and try to get personalized quotes for you and your car alone. The quotes are seemingly random, so you could apply smart talk to get a better quote (a read a post from someone who called a company X, got a silly large quote, called them again 30 minutes later, spoke with a different person, told them 'look what ridiculous quote I got from company Y just now!', and got an offer £1000 cheaper!). Alternatively, you can find websites that check your car and give you several quotes (just google, all are the same/have same quotes). Most quotes will be ridiculous. 

2. Bring your car from home and use it here. You will use the insurance you have in your country of origin and you will need to do MOT and insurance renewal in your home country as well. Many people do that. There is a caveat: be aware that you are supposed to go back or declare/register it in UK after 6 months! But I had friends who (allegedly) lived in UK for years with EU registered cars and never had any issues (but then again, they didn't get into any accidents, had any fines or got pulled by the police).

Plumps up my skin and leaves me feeling hydrated, I do use another hydrating serum to- my skin is just super dehydrated without anything hydrating stuff. I got two bottles, because there was  twofer offer XD. These should see me well into next year. 

I'm trying to make my mineral oil stretch till the beginning of October so I can buy another big bottle! **TTO and mineral oil** for OCMish is my favourite. I defiantly notice a difference when I don't use the TTO oil a part of my cleansing routine. 

Other then that I'm pretty happy to have *finally* found a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't leave me looking like and oil slick, nor too matte, *and* doesn't pill when applied on top of the rest of my routine. Drum roll! **Innisfree Eco safety daily sunblock SPF35 PA++ 50ml** but I will replace it with the SPF50 and or water resistant version when it runs out a I accidentally got the SPF35. 

**Adapalene**, a prescription retinoid, unless my derm suggests otherwise but for the time being I'll be getting a repeat prescription when this tube finishes- but I'll probably ask for the gel as I've got the cream version right now. 

I got a huge 400ml bottle of **Superdrug's Solait Lotion SPF30 UVA 5 Star &amp; Water Resistant**  on offer before I went to sunny Crete and it lasted me the week (multiple reapplications esp. as I was in the sea/ pool a lot). It worked just as it should and was super affordable meaning I didn't worry about the cost of it if that makes sense. Defo a repurchase for when I next go away!

Not quite a lotion or potion, but I'll be buying more of the **chamois type microfibre cloths** from Lidl next time I go near one as I think the washing machine has eaten a few of mine :/ and they're the gentlest, softest thing for my face!

It's easy to blame tribalism and take the moral high ground when you're giving guns to both sides and telling them to slog it out so that you can claim the ruins for yourself. Nigeria had a civil war in the 70s that claimed 2million lives, a tax battle between American companies contributed to the escalating ethnic tensions. And British supported the Nigerian government defeating the secessionists then electing military leaders who have profited immensely from the oil fields re-caputred land. Rather unsurprisingly the Igbo people haven't seen much of that money.

Who's next? Libya? We armed Wahhabi Islamists to overthrow Gadaffi, now they control several towns and cities and are ethnically cleansing the areas they control. Spoiler alert, Gadaffi wasn't bombing civilians. The reason we destabalised the country and caused thousands of deaths was because he opposed Western interventionism in Africa. For example he set up the African monetary fund and African Union to oppose the IMF and World Bank's bullshittery that I've already covered. Wait it gets better, the UN prevented the members of the AU from meeting Gadaffi, who was head of the AU, and the AU voted against Nato intervention in Gadaffi's absence. 

Somalia. Really not sure I need to explain this one. Americans have been bombing them since the 60s, and blocking food from entering the country. Anyone who opposes the US is labelled a terrorist in order to justify allowing 250,000 civilians die from famine. IMF-imposed currency devaluations led to hikes in the prices of fuel, fertiliser and farm inputs; social programmes were curtailed. Infrastructure collapsed and the deregulation of the grain market and the influx of ‘food aid’ left farmers destitute. Poor countries export food and ‘cash crops’ to rich ones. All economic activity which doesn’t serve the interests and profits of the West and international agribusiness is systematically destroyed. The West are trying to hide Somalia’s history as a self-sufficient food basket, and their role in its destruction, while denouncing Somalia as a ‘failed state’.

Syria. Guess what, we had our fingers in that pie too.

null,null,Mispla_cedUnderscore,eng-Bedfordshire,Bedfordshire,null,"In this country it's still the type of work you do and not like the US where its purely economical. Work the factory floor or a 'manual labour job' then you're working class. Work in a fancy office in the heart of [insert big city here], run a business (not an online cupcake one) or do a job that traditionally required a degree to perform (doctor/lawyer/scientist/engineer) then you're middle class. Has your family historically owned large parts of land (all those lovely manor houses dotted around the countryside) or are you descendants of previous monarchies then you're upper class. The upper class has power, the middle class has money but there's always way more working class than the other two put together.

It shows well in how politics has changed over centuries, they used to all be like the Tories, rich land-owners but with differing views, then as society advanced and the poor man got a better say (you traditionally wanted your estate owner in charge because he had your interests at heart) he voted in his 'own kind' and we got the Labour Party.

Income/wealth provides the layers within each group so in terms of money you can be 'rich' and middle-class or 'poor' and upper class. Its not the best film but The Riot Club shows this quite well, one the boy's family in it has to rent out and do tours of their manor house to keep up with repair/maintenance bills (it's a continual circle) [poor upper class] &amp; there's another one it who is 'poor upper class', whilst someone else's dad can be a city banker earning a tonne and only have a bank account to show it [upper working class].

Edit: Another good indicator of this is when Kate Middleton married Prince William, it was ""the first time in many generations that the Royal Family married a commoner."" Now Kate was far from a 'commoner' in the sense of her being a chav from some shitty council estate, she studied at Marlborough College (~£10k/term fees), her parents run a very successful business and so she was firmly middle class. However despite her family's wealth she wasn't upper class, which Diana was and David Cameron is, and was far from the usual social circle that the Royal Family entertains and that's why she is called a commoner.",null,0,null,1439568409,null,null,1439568879,0,cu2w6lw,null,t3_3gy9x6,null,null,null,t1_cu2qrbu,null,null,null,1441248530,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Adebayor has openly criticized the fans, used to play for arsenal, is very inconsistent, has a lot of frustrating personal problems that require him to take personal leave, has the reputation of being a contract player, former woolwich player, has known to cause issues in training sessions.

Soldado was never guilty of any of these things. He just didnt have the mental ability to succeed at the club. You knew the level adebayor could play at and thats why its frustrating when he doesnt perform. 

However, i completely agree with you on the mild racism point. Only african players are labeled lazy. I never see continentals or british players criticized for laziness like african players are.

I can judge a player on whatever I want - Half of the squad adore Soldado as you can see from twitter/instagram etc. You can see on and off the pitch that he genuinely cares about the team and about the club. Nobody here is saying he should stay - it's just sad losing such a good presence around the squad. 

Adebayor only cares about scoring goals for himself and that's fine. I don't expect every player to love the club - but the ones who do are more endearing to fans.

Bobby was 13 M + another 13 in performance-related addons. If you don't perform, we don't pay the addons. How much of that 26 M do you actually think we paid? 

I'm not agreeing with your Myth, but I am saying your Fact is, in fact, bullshit.

&gt;MYTH: Soldado tries. Ade doesn't.
&gt;FACT: WHAT?!! They both try. They're both playing the highest level of football imaginable. Just because Soldado emotes on the pitch more doesn't mean he tries harder.

Bobby tried every match. Ade didn't. I say this as an Adebayor apologist. I love the guy, even after last season.

&gt; MYTH: Adebayor stinks. Soldado is good.

I will vote for him as my second choice. I don't agree with Liz Kendall at all. Yvette Cooper becomes my third choice by default. 

My vote will count for Andy until he's wiped out. I expect my vote will never count for Yvette. If I were truly going for the ""anyone but Corbyn"" approach, I could choose as many of the other candidates as I wanted ahead of him. But that isn't ""tactical"", because I'm picking the candidates exactly as I believe in them.

My perhaps controversial opinion on this exact topic is that this aid needs to go directly to children, not to their parents. I don't think any party actually addresses this, because giving parents more money is in no way a guarantee that they will pass this on to their children.

&gt; If I haven't heard from you at [time] on [date] then I will assume you agree to these terms.

I used generous reply dates to start with (bear in mind people have other things to attend to other than legal disputes) and then start making them tighter if they demonstrate a history of bad faith. Emails can usually specify a speedier reply than postal messages.

Of course, it's worth saving this until you are met with difficulty - it is always possible you'll get co-operation to start with.

For the monies withheld by various parties worried about giving it to the wrong person, you could always get in touch with them and explain you'll approach the other side immediately to ask for 50-50 payments, and would they hold onto it in the meantime. Of course they are not obligated to do this, since they probably don't want the legal risk - but if you can reassure them, they may be willing to help.

Good luck!

&gt;You can't vote tactically because **your votes will pass from preferred candidate to preferred candidate** until somebody has a majority.

The point of the alternative vote is that you get to rank the candidates in the order you prefer, any combination of A,J,L &amp; Y. You don't have to vote *tactically* because even if your first choice is unpopular, your later preferences mean that you still side with candidates you find palatable. If you vote 1.Y 2.- 3.- then you've chosen to do that. Similarly, if you vote 1.Y 2.A 3.L you're also voting according to your choice. Voting *tactically* is when you vote for a candidate *other* than your choice. This is a system where you get to make as many preferential choices as there are candidates, *eliminating* the need for tactical voting.

It's a silly label to use as preferential voting is the point of AV. *Tactical* voting is an FPTP phenomenon.

You could vote tactically under AV to stop me: If you were to vote 1.A 2.- 3.- out of fear that Andy Burnham votes will drift to Corbyn if he's eliminated.

The obscure statute that self-proclaimed ""Freemen-on-the-Land"" use to claim that they are exempt from all laws and statutes has been repealed from the Magna Carta. The only surviving section that references Freemen is under Article 29:

&gt;Imprisonment, &amp;c. contrary to Law. Administration of Justice.

&gt;NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.

[Source](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/section/XXIX)

The Magna Carta has been almost completely repealed, even though it said to be irrepealable due to its status as a charter rather than an enactment, but this has largely been held to be false.

We thought 47 would be ok, they moved the goalposts. 

We will cave and pay over 50. 

There is some hope of an announcement on Sunday of something concrete - like an offer accepted. 

and he's literally just said we have offered 50m this afternoon. 

Usually he's close or spot on. He said KDB would tell them he wanted to leave and 2 days later the press was full of transfer request speculation. 

He also said we have scaled back our offer to KDB to compensate for the extra money demanded by Wolfsburg. 


Update - Ric has said allofs and KDB are meeting tonight. 

Tolmie says he should be in Manchester on Sunday, possibly at the game. 

They seem extremely confident at the moment. I'm assuming it's a case of if they accept the 50m then everything will happen very quickly. If they refuse, even after the meeting with Allofs, I guess we'd get delayed again.

My problem with a lot of left politics is exactly how you describe them. As C%^?s  It's the language of hatred. They're just people who have different views to you. Just normal people who make up this country. Do you think that you will convince these people to vote Labour when you are so dismissive of them? Why should they even consider your thoughts and ideas when basically you hate them.


There is this left narrative of the Tories hate the poor, the sick, the disabled. It doesn't look to me that hatred is the preserve of the right. The left at the moment even seems to hate itself. Labour is tearing itself apart at the moment.

4-3-2-1, I think Zarate does best a little bit back from the front line.  If we can hold possession and keep Noble from pushing to far up, I think Jenkinson and Cresswell can provide width, while having 5 in the midfield can hopefully hold their own against the 3-5-2.  Only concern I really have is if Zarate can pass the ball around well enough, instead of trying to beat the world on his own, and if Reid and Ogbonna can hold their own against 2 strikers with limited help.

You can't draw parallels because in a monarchy the leader bases their interests above the population. The very nature of their role will divide a nation. A politician is elected to hold the values of others and to serve the population. That difference is important.

Thatcher was suppose to work for the nation who elected her and through her policies, divided a nation. There is a fundamental difference that you are ignoring, and by doing so you're acting like you have debased the fact that Thatcher has divided the nation.

I'm not sure what point you are trying to make even if you accept that those kings were politicians. The situations were entirely different as you are looking at two very different systems of control. You couldn't really compare the way that those kings divided people to the way Thatcher did.

null,null,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;Do you believe that women are granted equal opportunities within the computer science industry?

Sure.  In fact, I think they're granted *better* opportunities than men.

&gt;That there is no stigma attached that would potentially make a woman hesitate to join the industry?

I've never seen any stigma.  Quite the reverse.  People go out of their way to make female coders feel valued and welcome.  Everyone's trying to attract more women to the industry.

&gt;It's similar stigma to women working in garages, building sites, pubs, kitchens and many more jobs.

No idea about stigma in those industries, but I doubt many women want jobs which involve heavy manual labor and mechanical work.  

&gt;It's similar to the stigma that stops men from pursuing roles within teaching, nursing etc.

It's true, some men do get sensitive about being thought of as  effeminate. (Presumably because they're scared of what *women* think of them.)  But, I don't know any men who *want* to work in nursing.  Not saying there aren't any - but it's not generally an occupation which attracts men.  

Again, I'm not aware of any serious evidence which backs up the claim that the gender discrepancies in these occupations is due to stigma or stereotyping.  I'm sure there are some instances of sexism, but I just don't think they account for the gender imbalances we're seeing in occupations like computer science.

You need to look at what the *scientists* are saying, as opposed to what the gender activists are saying.  Here's a good start - [a debate between two Harvard psychologists](http://edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html), which puts both sides of the argument.

null,null,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"I'm not arguing that s6 doesn't operate at all. I'm saying that they need a reasonable suspicion(not proof of impairment) to ask for a s6 test at the roadside. If they refuse, a s7(2)(c) allows the officer to ask again at the roadside (the place the test would have been administered had the subject complied), but also allows him to take a sample from the subject at a police station or hospital. Only failure to comply with s7(2)(c) is a criminal offence as the offence under s7(6) refers only to section 7 requirements to give a sample. For practical reasons and/or force policy, it may be common practice to conduct the s7 test at the station, but the officer doesn't have to. 

S6 is usually your first piece of evidence (if over the limit) and s7(2) your corroborating evidence but where the subject refuses to provide under s6 (which is not an offence), then both pieces must come under s7(2) and the subject is forced to do so, or be guilty of failing to provide a sample.

I may have jumped the gun earlier in my initial comment. It is correct to say that s7(6) does not make it illegal to fail to provide  a sample at the roadside under s6, however,  if you are asked again under s7(2)(c) at the roadside, as they can do, then it is unlawful to refuse. This is what I meant when I said they must comply under s7(6). It works eventually as you can only refuse once.

Not to mention the fact that a move away from Anfield or Liverpool in general - because it'd be hard to find an area in town where you could stick an entire stadium that isn't inaccessible or a bit of a shithole - would be very unpopular with fans. Just look at the Everton opposition to moving their stadium to somewhere like Speke or Kirkby. 

And a big part of this stadium project is to try and redevelop Anfield as an area, with the Liverpool City council putting a fair amount of funding in. I'd much prefer that than us plonking some new spaceship stadium on a field just outside St Helens and abandoning the Anfield area to deteriorate even further. 

That and the costs of a new stadium don't really work out in terms of investment and payback time for the investment. If we were talking some kind of 90,000 seater stadium then maybe it would make sense to build a new place rather than simply expanding, but even when the plans were based around a new stadium the capacity was barely above what the expanded Anfield is expected to be - and the costs were multiple times greater.

**Aston Villa** - Guzan, Bacuna, Richards (c), Clark, Amavi, Westwood, Gueye, Veretout, Sinclair, Ayew, Agbonlahor

Bench - Bunn, Baker, Hutton, Sanchez, Kozak, Gestede, Richardson

**Manchester United** - Romero, Darmian, Smalling, Blind, Shaw, Carrick, Schneiderlin, Mata, Januzaj, Depay, Rooney (c)

Bench - Johnstone, Valencia, McNair, Schweinsteiger, Herrara, Young, Hernandez

**Kick Off**

**4'** United dominating possession, Villa set up to break on the counter. Playing with Ayew, Agbonlahor and Sinclair as the front 3 suggests they'll try to use their pace to exploit Blind on the turn

**7'** Depay gives the ball away on half way after a terrible touch, Villa attempt to counter but the ball gets caught under foot and the attack breaks down.

**8'** Sinclair plays in Veretout behind Shaw, had an opportunity to put the ball across the 6 yard box, but cuts back, allowing Shaw to use his pace to recover and rectify his error, clearing the ball.

**13'** Slow start so far in this one. United looking pretty rusty, but thats expected this early on in the season. Villa are holding there own in terms of possession, looking like being a sure bet for a top table position at this rate. Personally think they've recruited very well from Ligue 1 especially this window, and Richards is looking like a master stroke from Sherwood. But back to the game, where absolutely nothing is going right for United.

**16'** Depay free kick from the left side, ball makes its way to an unmarked Schneiderlin looping around a the back post, but his header goes over.

**20'** Clearance hits Carrick in the face, and the deflection puts Depay in a race to the ball with Guzan. Depay gets the first touch, but Guzan makes a great tackle inside his area and the danger is averted

**22'** Villa have stepped forward now, playing quite intricate, free flowing football in the United half when in possession. Also looking quite solid in defence. 

**28'** **GOAL - Januzaj! 1-0 United** Mata plays a great ball into Januzaj who cuts back onto his right foot. Micah Richards over commits and slides past him, and Januzaj shoots straight at Guzan. The ball takes a devillish deflection off of Clark who had attempted to block the shot, and the ball goes in off the inside of the far post.

**38'** Villa corner, Richards header goes over. Replays show that Darmian was all over him. Commentator rant about referees ensues.

**HALF TIME** Quite a scrappy game, lots of broken down attacks. Game is mostly being played in the midfield third for both teams. Both teams seem to be struggling with the final ball. United are playing pretty expansively, making the pitch big and stretching Villa's formation to allow Januzaj and Mata space in between the lines. Villa, to their credit, are making a game of it. After an initial spell of defence, they've come out and played some good football, and seemed to have the better of it in the last 10 minutes of the half.

**Second Half**

**48'** Lazy pass from Mata puts Ayew in 1 on 1 with Smalling. He cuts inside and fires, but his shot is high and wide.

**52'** Amavi gets in behind Darmian, then easily goes past Smalling before whipping an amazing ball at head height across the 6 yard box. Unfortunately, there's no one on the end of the ball, and it goes out for a throw in on the opposite touch line.

**55'** Villa corner, Agbonlahor wins himself a free header, and the shot is saved by Romero. Straight at the goal keeper in the end. Probably should be doing better from there

**59'** Villa Substitution - **Sinclair Off, Gestede On**

**60'** United Substitutions - **Januzaj Off, Herrara On** | **Carrick Off, Schweinsteiger On**

**70'** Depay free kick goes well over the bar. Still rising as it hits the Villa crowd. 

**73'** Brilliant ball from Mata splits Richards and Bacuna and Depay is in 1 on 1 with Guzan on his favoured foot, but his shot goes wide. Looks like a good purchase ^/s

**78'** Shot from Depay from 22 yards, easy save low to his right for Guzan

**78'** Villa Subsitution - **Veretout Off, Sanchez On**

**82'** United Substitution - **Depay Off, Young On**

**FULL TIME - Aston Villa 0 Manchester United 1** Januzaj's goal wins it for United, in an otherwise poor encounter. Villa lacked quality in the final third, though they looked promising in some of the build up play. United lacked polish in most of what they did, but their midfield won them this game. Thought Depay was quite poor tbh, not a lot of what he did came off.

They will never say that. However from the discussions I've had with them on here leads me to no other conclusions, frankly. They love Corbyn because he's principled, and I can completely understand that. However they'd still want him to lead even if it meant Labour were guaranteed to lose in 2020. They'd rather a principled loser than a copy &amp; paste winner.

So while they won't say it that way, that is the only conclusion anyone can come to from what they're saying.

Most people won't be directly affected by the cuts, so won't see them as an over-arching bad thing. Plus the public seems to be on board with the need to reduce the deficit. Plus, if Osbourne is actually able to eliminate the deficit by 2020, Corbyn will have to campaign on a platform of increasing the deficit again compared to Osbourne's what would be successful record.

null,null,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"First off, the obvious disclaimer - tactical voting doesn't work at all if the polls are like they currently are with one candidate getting &gt;50% of the vote in the first round. The way the polls are, I don't think tactical voting would gain anything.

However the example in the article is a pretty good one though - the order in which candidates are eliminated affects the result.

If you were part of the anyone but Corbyn crowd, then if you could reasonably determine what each member would put as their second choice for a given first choice, you could vote tactically.

So say you knew that people who put Andy as the first choice are likely to have put Corbyn as their second choice. Then it would be in your best interests to keep Andy in the running as long as possible. 

If (as is not the case this time) it looked likely that Andy could lose in the first round with Corbyn at 40% and Yvette at 40%, then even if you prefer Liz, it would be tactical to put Andy first to try and save him.  If this means Andy coming third in the first round with Liz coming fourth, then Liz (your actual preferred candidate) would be eliminated, and Liz's second preferences are redistributed.

Liz's second preferences are more likely to be for Yvette or Andy, with nothing going to Corbyn. So theoretically, Yvette is boosted to 51% with Corbyn sticking around 40%. Yvette wins the leadership election.

If, however, you stuck with simply voting who you preferred and put Liz first, then Andy might end up fourth. Andy is eliminated and his votes distributed to Corbyn. Corbyn goes up to 51% and then Corbyn wins the election.

It's a bit more convoluted than in FPTP, but it is possible.

EDIT: The same report also gave an amusing (because, as even they say, the chances of this happening are nil as it would require an incredibly rare setup) thought experiment which illustrated that you can counter-counter tactical vote in some situations (essentially, suppose you had a constituency where Labour polled first (in a relatively safe seat), Conservatives second and Lib Dems third. Then some Conservatives could instead put Lib Dems as their first preference as they know conservative voters would put lib dems as their second preference thus ensuring all votes go to the Lib Dems beating Labour. Then if you were a Labour supporter who knew conservatives were voting tactically in this way, it would be tactical to vote Conservative as your first preference to ensure the Tories came second so the lib dems get eliminate with their votes going evenly to conservative and Labour, ensuring a Labour victory)",null,0,null,1439579392,null,null,1439580082,0,cu33lot,null,t3_3gzolu,null,null,null,t1_cu2z9ag,null,null,null,1441252091,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

I am building a PC, and am looking for these parts.

I would be happy for them to be in their original box, but it doesn't change anything.

I can collect from most locations between Exeter and Paington


Type|Item|Paying
:----|:----|:----
**GPU** | 280X | £110
**CPU** | Pentium G3258 / i3 | £40 / £60
~~**Mobo** | MSI H81M-P33 V2 | £25~~

**Storage** | 1TB HDD | £30
**PSU** | EVGA 500W 80+ bronze | £30

**Powerline adapter** | | £25

I would buy the case on my own, as it would feel better with a new case. Also, I already have a monitor and a TV that are both 19', so I can use two displays.

**EDIT**: It would help alot if I could see that the parts are working fine.

**EDIT 2**: I might also possibly pay on PayPal, but for the same price

Who are you to decide that a person lives a life not wanting to help themselves or their family? There are many mental illnesses that affect everyone, that stops them making correct decisions. Look at depression, record number of people are suffering from which. It is a real condition that has physiological effects. It can drain you of your motivation, make you seem that things are pointless and stop you from seeing the positive from things. Depression is linked to financial pressure, personal perceptions and personal relationships. You can be rich or poor and develop the mental illness. The poor can't afford to work their way out of it, get told that they are pathetic scroungers who are too lazy to work and ultimately do not have the same chances as someone wealthier to overcome their issues. The same can be said for anxiety and addiction, things that also effect the poor significantly worse than the wealthier.

Produced by YJB films, Jack to a King is a passionate portrait of the rise of Swansea City Football Club from near oblivion to the world stage of the Premier League. The program tells the story of the people who made the club what it is today, and a city that survives against all odds – through the German Blitzkrieg of World War II, industrial decline and recession. The second part of the program will air on Saturday, August 22, at 2 p.m. ET on NBC.

You have a problem with the fact that if a parent has a low income job and can't afford to feed their child that I help the child and not the parent? Helping the child cuts out the possibility that the parent won't use the money to help their child. For example giving the child free school dinners is a better idea than giving the parents free money to maybe buy their child dinners with. 

I'm not saying all parents are irresponsible, just that a parent in extreme financial difficulty and likely a lot of debt isn't going to be able to feed their child with the money you give them to feed their child. But I guess actually feeding the child makes me an inequality loving monster.

null,null,TheInternQuestions,null,null,null,"Yes traditionally mechanical engineering has been one of the best engineering degrees to get because a) you are versatile, You can work in almost every industry and b) the job demand has always been high and will always remain high because companies will always need mechanical engineers. Now the way I see it everything is run by computers and everything in the future will continue to go to computers. The future of technology is in robotics, computer logarithm optimization and variety of things all relating to computer engineering and its starting to reflect in the salaries of engineers. Now take my advice with a grain of salt because I am located in the USA and I am only talking about the USA market since that is what I am exposed to. It might be different where you are from. This is definitely a new trend that is happening but it will continue to happen. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google pretty much all big tech companies are in a huge battle for engineering talent. This is driving up the pay rate for computer engineers but money is not the solution to everything. No matter what degree you get if its an engineering degree you are going to make good money so don't worry too much about that. You say you like the mechanical engineering work then I think you should go into that career. The best career advice I can give you is find a way to make good money with something you like. There was a very interesting study done here (I'll try to find a link to it later) that pretty much said money does buy happiness up to a certain point. the study concluded that more money brings more happiness up to around $70,000 because that is the amount needed in the USA to live a comfortable life without financial problems. Everyone that makes more than that yes they can buy more stuff but it really did not make a huge difference in terms of happiness for the people in the study. So yeah good luck in your career path I personally love engineering it will be hard but trust me stick with it and it will all be worth it in the end.

But, in the US at least, atheists are often the *least* trusted of all religious categories - even more unpopular than muslims.  Getting people to vote based on the personal beliefs of the candidates would penalize atheists more than most.

&gt;You can feel ""uncomfortable"" with someone who believes in Judaism as a religion, but Jewishness is mixed up with race.

Sure, but there are still going to be plenty of people who will never vote for someone who's Jewish.  What kind of message are you sending those people if you tell them that you wouldn't vote for a Muslim - no matter what his/her ideas?

I'm a big-time fire-breathing atheist myself, but I think that *secularism* offers more protection for everyone than discrimination based on religious identity.

He isn't a communist but he is a socialist of the kind that were prominent in the 1980s. A Tony Benn style socialist. It's all the same kind of things. A radically different relationship between the citizen and the state, a much bigger state with far more nationalised industries. He wants to leave NATO and abolish trident. He wants to reopen the coal mines. Then there is the usual tax and spend stuff which I would say is his prime appeal (along with nationalising the railways). 

So I wouldn't say he is a communist but he is about far left as someone gets in this country. He really is in the same group as those socialist worker people you sometimes see on the street.

Inside Out is the movie everyone’s talking about right now and loads of people have made an incorrect connection between this and our characters, The Numskulls. It’s a great sign for any person or brand to be featured in The Beano; a recognition of cultural significance. In this instance, we’ve employed gentle parody to answer a question a lot of people were asking, in a non-confrontational and classically cheeky Beano style. We’ve tried to point out the difference between both properties and think we’ve done so in the best way we know. We always look forward to receiving positive feedback about content such as this, typically from the subject themselves. The Numskulls are hoping Pixar get in touch to help them realise their new ambition.”

The size of a representative sample doesn't vary with the size of the overall population as much as people seem to think. 1,000 people is fine even for, say, China if it's selected properly!

(e: Also, just to clarify why: the gains in representativeness that you get by increasing sample size decay exponentially, so a sample of 100,000 is actually not much more representative than a sample of 1,000 even though a sample of 1,000 is obviously much more so than, say, 5. As a blunt and very rough analogy, if you think about rolling a die to try and determine whether it's weighted fairly, in theory the population would be infinite -- in the sense that the probability of getting a particular outcome is the proportion of times the die would turn up that number if rolled infinitely -- but you'd probably have a pretty good sense after, say, a hundred rolls, and with a thousand you can be fairly sure, within a very narrow confidence interval.)

I went to a state school that specialised in languages (we got extra money from the EU and government for it). Back in 2000-2005, they did French or German for the first year, then you got to add Spanish, Russian or French/German (the one you didn't do first year). Now, they do modern Greek, Italian and Mandarin as well. I also did a year of French and German at primary school, but that was very basic. 

I went to do A Levels at an independent/private school, because I wanted to do A Level Russian and my state school didn't do past 16. The council gave my parents some money towards it, because it was my only option and I got a scholarship for the rest. That school did French, German, Russian and Spanish and you could do Italian and Mandarin as extra curriculars. The thing that *astounded* me was that they actually taught Ancient Greek and Latin - I was under the impression that this was something only the poshest schools did (think Eton, Harrow etc etc). I think they had to do Latin for a year and did Greek if they picked to do a Classics GCSE. 

As for what was popular - at secondary school, most people wanted to do French or Spanish when they got to choose. Spanish, mainly. Russian was not popular, but the people that wanted to do it *really* wanted to do it. It was pretty much the same at A Level, except German was much more *un*popular. There were 3 people in my Russian A Level class, and about 20 in my French AS class. There were two people in the Classics A Level class, which included Greek and Latin (one of them was in my Russian class too. She went on to study Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse at Oxford.

Bullshit. Soldado shrinked out of games as badly as anyone. Seriously I think at this point the mods need to make it a rule on this sub that if you bring up Soldado's ""work ethic"" you need to start citing some stats that show distance covered/runs made/tackles made.

&gt; Adebayor however, has no interest in playing football

Bullshit. Adebayor has carried this team on two different occasions. Everyone loves to talk about Soldado's ""personal issues"" and extend such compassion to him, but we know for a fact that Adebayor's personal life is an absolute mess, and we give him dog's abuse. Especially when you consider that he has actually given us results. In my eyes from what I've seen, Adebayor genuinely works harder on the pitch then Soldado does, but I'm not going to try use that as a point because like I said, I'm not equipped with stats to prove it.

Furthermore, why wasn't Paulinho/Capoue/Chiriches given the same treatment? All seemed like ~good professionals~, all seemed like ~nice guys~, but when they left we were allowed to be excited. 

If Lennon leaves, will he get the same sendoff? Been at the club for a decade and given us countless memories, only one left of the CL team.

What if Andros leaves? The boy is one of our own and clearly loves the shirt. Plus unlike Bobby he ACTUALLY runs his ass off every single time.

&gt;IS THE USE OF rBST LEGAL?

&gt;From 1990 onwards, the EU had imposed a moratorium banning the use of rBST across Europe. In December 1999, following consideration of the SCAHAW report (see above), the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers finally voted to impose an indefinite ban on use of the drug in Europe on animal welfare grounds, a move strongly supported by the RSPCA, who had been lobbying for such a ban for some time.

Veretout was a bit slow on the ball at times, needs to move the ball a bit quicker, but thats just the difference when playing in the premier league.
The goal, in my eyes was mainly due to poor defending, richards diving in and Geuye not following his man. But also some luck for United with the deflection was going straight for Guzan otherwise. 
The long balls at the start of the game were infuriating but we seemed to start passing a lot better in the second half, which we need to continue doing.

Amavi is class. Held is own, good going forward and good at the back, minus that one time he kept the ball alive when he should've let it run out and United got a free cross.

Midfield really did put it a shift like Tim said in his post match interview. They worked hard and minus the failure to back track with Adnan to concede the goal they really did do well. It'll take time for these guys to adapt to the prem but hopefully it'll come about soon.

Ayew wasn't 100% but i felt he did look a bit more confident than in the Bournemouth game, he had a shot, took a few people on, but we can't just all blame him, you've got to look at the service these guys are getting as well.

Gestede, well ok, he didn't score and he set his bench mark high but he can clearly hold his own and his introduction to the game certainly worried United as they made two quick subs after he came on. Losing the header to Blind was a bit sad though.

Defensively, compared to last year we looked good. You've got to admit it. Last year we'd have all went into this game thinking we'll be lucky if we don't concede three goals. We didn't. We conceded one goal. One goal from one moment of sloppiness from a team looking to go top 4.

Lots of positives to take from the game. I love gabby but he's got to go and i think Tim knows it as well and we're just waiting for Gil, Grealish and now Traure(spelling?) to be fit and ready and hopefully, we'll be pacey, exciting and get a few more shots on target.

For a start processing something outside of the normal payroll cycle does not mean it's not included in payroll calculations. Secondly, if this for some wild reason did happen the company would be at fault, thirdly she would just have to account for it at the end of the financial year.

Oh and finally how exactly do you think the vast majority of businesses pay their employees? Um... bank transfer perhaps?

This payment outside of payroll doesn't refer to outside the entire payroll process like some brown envelope under the table. It's in reference to outside the normal monthly wage payment cycle. This is something that happens all the time. Accounting fucks up and misses your bonus off, someone forgets to add your overtime, HR fails to declare the holiday on your maternity pay.

null,null,Forward_Left,,Born Again Socialist | Corbyn / Eagle,null,"The SNP are emplaced now. They will have to mess up significantly to lose their seats the way we did. As /u/Dangerman1337 said, a lot of their majorities are absolutely insane. How can we expect them to make the same mistakes we did when they can hardly take their eye off Scotland, *all they have is Scotland*.

Here's how the land lies:
1 SNP seat has a majority of under 1,000.
6 SNP seats have majorities of under 5,000.
28 SNP seats have majorities of under 10,000.

**Of their 56 seats, if we agree to put aside for a moment any with majorities of over 10,000 - we have 28 theoretical target seats.**

**But actually, it's much worse than that.** Of those seats:

Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Majority: 328) is an **SNP/Con** Marginal.

East Dunbartonshire (Majority: 2,167) is an **SNP/LD** Marginal.

Edinburgh West (Majority: 3,210) is an **SNP/LD** Marginal.

Caithness  Sutherland &amp; Easter Ross (Majority 3,844) is an **SNP/LD** Marginal.

Na H-eileanan An Iar (Majority: 4,102) is **SNP/Lab** but is a *very small* constituency - with a 73% turnout delivering just under 16,000 votes. Relatively, it is not a marginal.

Fife North-East (Majority: 4,344) is **SNP/LD**.

Ross,  Skye &amp; Lochaber (Majority: 5,124) is **SNP/LD**.

Dumfries &amp; Galloway (Majority: 6,514) is **SNP/Con**.

West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Majority: 7,033) is **SNP/Con** (in this seat, Labour are 4th, behind the Lib Dems.).

Argyll and Bute (Majority: 8,473) is **SNP/LD**.

Gordon (Majority: 8,687) is **SNP/LD**.

Moray (Majority: 9,065) is **SNP/Con**.

Perth and North Perthshire (Majority: 9,641) is **SNP/Con**.

That reduces the number of seats in play to 13, assuming an ability to uniformly overturn majorities of 10,000 - only possible in a wave election.

On the plus-side, there are another 22 SNP seats with between 10,000 and 15,000 majorities, so in this mythical wave-election we would probably sweep the board.

**That is not going to happen any time soon, whether we have Corbyn or ABC.** Labour's decay took a very long time to be punished, why would voters prove fickle to the SNP quicker than they proved fickle to Labour. **So, on the best night we could reasonably hope for in Scotland, next time we win back maybe 7-13 seats.**

Yet Libya had nuclear weapons and gave them up in hope for better relations with the west. The first moment we got a chance to topple their government, we took it.

My issue with Irish unification is how undemocratic it is. The Republic of Ireland deserves it's indepedence because the vast majority of those people don't want to be in the UK. Northern Ireland however has a majority support for staying in the UK. People who want Irish unification have until recently just ignored them. They care more about the minority that want to join Ireland as if they are the only people who should have a say.

Which doesn't make any logical sense. If having a nationalist minority is wrong in a British NI. What makes have a regionally dominant Unionist minority in the Irish republic good?

About ten years ago dairy became really profitable, which is why now it is the case that dairy farming is about 20% of all farming in the UK. 

Milk is a transnationally traded asset, so while most people buy milk produced less than a hundred miles from their doors, that isn't the case for all milk. And since Russia has ceased to import EU milk in retaliation for our sanctions on them for Ukraine, there is a glut of milk in Europe right now.

Businesses who produce a product that can be sold for less than their cost of production - even when they get subsidies, and even when there are restrictions in place on the amount that can be produced - should go out of business in my view. They already have two artificial advantages and they still can't compete.

I think once this period is over she could perhaps go down for two weeks as a token gesture (so she can say she's legally worked for the company for 3 months since ending maternity) while you take holidays from work for ""childcare"", hand in her resignation of day one of said two weeks? Also, she should have been accruing holidays during her year off, see if she can get one of those weeks as holidays?

 Or look into what they call a ""phased return"", where she works say two days per week. My work offers this for 12 weeks and I'm about 60% sure phased return is treated the same as a request for part time working i.e the company has an obligation to consider this and have to prove good business reasons for declining?

Lord Janner Quote:

&gt; I am sorry that he was not tried while he was fit enough to stand. War criminals have managed to evade prosecution under our system of justice for decades.

Lord Janner is stating he regrets the man was not tried when he was **fit enough to stand trial**. This is the key fact. He regrets the fact that when the Nazi was on trial he was not fit enough to be judged accordingly. He is not suggesting he should be tried with dementia. He is saying he doesn't care what age they are now they **should** have been dealt with years ago - when they **were** fit enough to stand trial. This is something I completely agree with. 

For this same reason I think Lord Janner should have stood trial years ago when he was fit enough to defend himself. 

Let us also remember that Lord Janner was officially declared as having Alzheimer's in 2009 - long before any allegations came to light. He has not just suddenly come out as unfit to stand trial.

However the man did study Law at Trinity, Cambridge and then went on to become Barrister followed by QC. He knows how to play the game - whether he is playing it now or not who can say. It is going to be difficult to prove it either way.

TL:DR

Months ago a KTM rider was most displeased at being overtaken. So he chased and attacked another biker. 

It escalated to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLQLG_toQhw

The driver said he heard a bike and moved across... the driver of the lorry got £500 fine and zero penalty points. When really this was attempted murder. BJG did NOTHING and stood by the driver and even went to court with the driver and backed him 100% suggesting he did nothing wrong... more videos of the driver acting violently turned up.

So what happened? An internet witch hunt occurred and doxxing. After 3 days he deleted his twitter, shut down his website and deleted his facebook. People then wrote to the local transport commissioner to strip them of their licence. Others wrote to their insurers (who paid out immediately on seeing the video) and the company had their insurance cancelled. 

After 4 days the boss of BJG made a statement and said the driver no longer worked for him. The witch hunt was postponed until solid evidence that he's been fired and stripped of his driving licence.

I'd recommend watching [4 days in October](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGp8vIt2Ltg) the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary that has Bill Simmons (former ESPN pundit, now has own show on HBO, HUGE Boston homer), just talking to a buddy in a bar and recounting the series.

In terms of legends: Ted Williams ""The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived"", played his entire career with the Sox, but took a couple of years off to fight in WWII.

Johnny Pesky, third base, a lead-off batter who had a knack of hitting balls down the first-base line, that the foul pole at Fenway is known as Pesky Pole, played with Teddy. Didn't spend his entire playing career here, but came back in management later on.

Carl Yastzemski aka Yaz, first baseman, another career Sox player who led us to the Pennant title in 1967 ""the Impossible Dream"" season, by winning the triple crown in baseball (topping the league in batting average, home run, and RBI, an impressive feat that was only just recently done in 2012). 

More recently, Jason Varitek, catcher and captain. Love him for just [this moment](http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/sports/2012/02/28/28_arod.w560.h375.jpg).

Also Pedro Martinez, pitcher, who was apart of the 2004 team that broke the curse, just inducted in the hall of fame. If you ever get to see a game at Fenway Park you might notice a group of fans standing on the Green Monster above center field with giant K's to keep record of the pitcher's strikeouts. This was started because of Pedro's 1999 season, where his number of strikeouts were absolutely insane. They are known as the K-krew and are at every home game.

Speaking of Fenway, it is known as ""America's Most Beloved Ballpark"". The oldest ballpark in the MLB, it has a rich history in it of itself. There's the Green Monster, which is a wall in left field 37 ft high, making it notoriously hard to hit home runs there. There's also the aforementioned Pesky Pole in right field. Located in the heart of the city in Kenmore square, Fenway is one of only a few sports stadiums actually surrounded by the city (Wrigley in Chicago is the other that comes to mind). Flanked by Landsdowne St and Yawkey Way, there are plenty of sports bars in the area that you can enjoy for the game, and after games plenty of clubs as well in the area. (Side note, I go to school right next to Fenway, as in I can hear the crowds when my windows are open. Also end up frequenting the clubs around there often :D)

In terms of recent history, won the series in 2004, 2007, and 2013. Haven't done too well in these past two seasons. And bad news today, our manager, John Farrell, has been diagnosed with cancer, and has to take the rest of the season off for chemo. 

In terms of current players:

Dustin Pedroia, second baseman, little guy, who nobody believed in early in his career, but then came to be the best second basemen in the league.

David Ortiz aka Papi, designated hitter. Famously hit the walk-offs in extra-innings in games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS to preserve the Red Sox. Also recently in game 2 of the 2013 ALCS, hit a grand slam to tie the game late, and allowed the Red Sox to win the game and tie the series 1-1.

So not really a brief intro, but has a lot of important info.

Anyone who tells you that the rise of the SNP is to do with nationalism doesn't know what they're talking about. Things like tuition fees and trident are *really* important to most scots, and to everyone I know who voted SNP for the first time. Obviously we shouldn't just let Scotland write the manifesto, but when you allow the SNP to outflank you on a series of major issues, what else do you expect? 

Secondly, as many have been pointing out, the day to day rubbings of the Scottish Labour Party were a shambles. Their involvement in most communities is negligible. 

A third (and personally i think it was much much less important that the first two, but not irrelevant) issue was labours performance in the referendum. Yes, allying with the Tories was part of it, but for me, it was the language they used. The idea that Scotland couldn't survive on its own was both tactically awful and untrue. Those who said ""don't leave us, you can't survive on your own"" triggered the psychological boomerang effect, and only strengthened people's resolve to prove they could.

Now with hunger, the limit is of course stealing since procurement of food requires money which is presently unavailable. Then the next logical step is damage limitation, a rational thinking human being will probably look to non-violent forms of procurement of goods e.g. shoplifting.

However rationality does break down in regards to hunger and its effects on decision making. As stated by Alistair Reynolds ""“A city's only ever three hot meals away from anarchy.”. So I would say the actions you are stating such as violence occur depending on the emotional state of the assailant due to hunger or malnourisment.

Just look at the French Revolution, a hungry belly drives irrational (or required) actions. Rather allow a hungry person to steal than force their hand. We are survivalists by nature. A similar argument can be placed at your shelter argument. With a homeless person choosing an abandoned home/warehouse etc. over a home with a family in it because it has yet to become necessary for that person to attempt more reckless and violent actions.

Now here's the thing. That kind of foreknowledge is just ridiculous. You can't assume to know that with any kind of reasonableness so the whole thing just falls apart. It only works on paper and in practice it won't make any difference. These perfect predictions of mass second-preferences just don't exist. You could have a system of tactically voting by which voters defeat a broad church by keeping the fringe parties in the game for as long as possible, and then eliminating them one by one. But that then requires perfect execution to involve the main party not being defeated.

Back to the real voting: The thing with the ABC crowd is that there isn't any set pattern to how the votes will disperse. The Kendall votes have a Corbyn undercurrent because they're seen as the candidates for shaking up the establishment. Yvette is the one I'd expect to be the safest to knock out if we were trying to block Corbyn, but she won't go out in the first round.

null,null,sharklazers99,null,null,null,"&gt;But we are not under imminent threat of invasion, and personally I would rather we surrendered than killed millions of people with nukes. What about diplomacy?

The thing with invasions and wars is that you can never predict what would happen and when. You can also never predict what type of politicians we will have. Just look at Libya and Syria. Our government along with France and the US rushed to pour oil in a small fire because they thought they could get two puppet states. That was two years after the Americans left Iraq. Now three countries have been destabilised and the situation in the ME is much much worse than it ever was in the height of the Iraq war. All because Sarkozy, Clinton and Cameron where so venal and Obama was to weak to say no. Our idea of diplomacy was to essentially tell our enemies to do what we want and then we ""may"" throw them a bone. We can't predict the future and I prefer having the Trident just in case.

If war did happen I would much prefer the UK surrenders than destroy the world but I doubt most people in the UK share that feeling.

&gt;So do you support the Russian separatists in Ukraine then? Similar situation there. USSR encouraged settlement in soviet states, now the USSR is no more but nearly all former soviet states have populations loyal to Russia living there.

I do support the Russian separatists for the same reason why I support Irish indepedence and Northern Ireland staying in the UK. A nation should be composed of people who want to be in their. If Scotland voted to leave I wouldn't have a problem. In Ukraine the governemnt just suppressed people. 

Russia settled Ukraine in the 1700s before the USSR. Back then half of Ukraine was empty and the rest was ruled by Muslim tatars. The Russian government sent in Christian peasants. These people have been living in Ukraine for a lot longer than most Americans have been living in North America. 

What we have right now in Ukraine is a country that is split. Ukraine has a country has never existed in the way it exists today. Large parts of it were essentially just Russian border territory (the name Ukraine means borderlands) amalgated with Polish and Austrian territory. Donetsk and Lvov have never been in the same country until Stalin put them together. Crimea was never Ukraine until the 1950s.

Ukrainians in the west are in the process of creating what I would say is a false and very nationalistic historical narrative. Something that irks Eastern Ukrainians and Crimeans who identify more with Russia and it's history.

There are parts of Ukraine that openly want to join Russia. Crimea is a good example. It's an area that identifies as Russian. in the '90s they tried to have a referendum and leave. The Ukrainians sent in force to get rid of their leader, remove their constitution and forced them to accept leaders from mainland Ukraine. They had no interest in giving regions the ability to secede the way we gave Scotland the right to do so. When the Russians came the local Crimeans soldiers defected at a drop of a hat. Non-Crimean Ukrainians did nothing because they knew how the locals felt.

&gt;I think you have to look at historical context really, for centuries England oppressed, enslaved and exploited Ireland. After some horrific violence they finally gave Ireland independence, but not the poor people in northern Ireland. It's a bit unfair. And sure it ignores the needs of some people, but that's small fry compared to the needs of the Irish people the British government managed to ignore through the centuries.

I know the history of Ireland. I'm of African descent. My grandparents spent most of their lives under British rule and frankly they had nothing good to say about British people. To them it was a nightmarish and powerful evil forgien ruler that didn't care about people. So I sympathise with Irish people for what they have been through.

However that doesnt mean I think NI should leave. Forcing NI to join the Republic will not make up for what was done to the Irish in the past. You'll be creating new victims of injustice. People who are not Catholic and not republican will be forced to join a state that is essentially that. Their voice is equal to that of nationalists. If the majority of NI want to stay in the UK then that should be the end of the discussion. To automatically say they should be in Ireland ignores these people. We already know the dangers of a discontented minority in Ireland.

The fact is though we have to go with what's happened every previous election cycle, and from that we know for a fact Labour have to win over Conservative voters in marginal seats to win. This is what they have always done before and this cannot change.

Maybe Corbyn's ""anti-establishment"" style will chime with some Conservative voters. However, my guess is his radical ideas and inability to explain where he's going to get his money from will put voters off. For example, his first economic speech talked about billions in tax that people/companies are magically going to start paying.  As a Labour voter I find this incredulous and laughable, never mind those who thought Ed Miliband would be too frivolous with the nation's finances.

My guess is the electorate will like Corbyn, but he'll be like Woolworths - a shop plenty had a fondness for and were disappointed when it failed, but when push came to shove people's loyalties lay elsewhere.

They're basically the back-seat drivers of Westminster/UK politics.

If you look at the SNP's record in the Scottish parliament you'll see a party almost indistinguishable from New Labour (and if anything further to the right).  They cut college places; froze council tax (basically a tax cut) which means local councils get even less money than they would have already because of Tory austerity; and regularly contract the private sector using public money.

This is the problem with Corbyn - he's spent so long taking prinicpled stands of things when he says what he wants to do the numbers simply do not add up. Nationalising rail/energy companies would cost hundreds of billions of pounds. It would probably take decades to do - Why? So we could pay a little less for electricity/gas/rail fares?

null,null,Buddah_Noodles,null,null,null,"Rodgers should have started the way we finished argument: I disagree.

Maybe it would have worked, maybe not. But here's the interesting-er thing: the tactical switch was planned. The first 60 minutes were about getting Stoke worn down and conditioned to expect certain things, then making the switch when it was too late for them to adjust to it. 

Ibe wears down fullbacks quickly and gets their bodies to expect certain runs, meaning Firmino tears them apart when he comes on. Also means that Clyne all of a sudden as space created in which to bomb forward, and the opponents are too exhausted to track him or to exploit the space he leaves. You force certain subs from them to compensate, which means you dictate their formation and are prepared to exploit it.

Hendo sits and bides his time so that he is fresh for the end when the defenders are too tired to track runners. Milner can move more inside when we have possession instead of the wide-right position he took up in the first half.

It is boring to say that the formation we finished with won, therefore we need to start with that. The game is more complex. And I am glad to see that Brendan and O'Driscoll have more to their minds than trying to win it in the first 15 and then throwing spaghetti at the wall in the last 15 if we aren't winning.
