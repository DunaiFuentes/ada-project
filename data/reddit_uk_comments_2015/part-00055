I agree that we were weak on the left, but my question remains, what was the alternative? Chadli is obviously not 100% and it has been an area where (if rumours are to be believed) we have been looking to fill with a new player. That area should be **supported** by Mason and Jan when Eriksen can't fulfill his defensive duties as well. 

The penalty had nothing to with Eriksen not offering enough cover on the left though and Ibe had several moments when he was mugging several of our players, not just Rose. 

&gt; Pochettino did not make the right adjustments to that problem and we gave away a penalty and a goal from that side.

I still fail to see what adjustments you are recommending other than to replace either Mason or Bentaleb with Dembele and shift Eriksen centrally. Since you obviously seem to think you know better as you keep on saying he didn't make the right decisions - what would have been the right ones?

His 40 yard passes might be difficult to control, but the receiving player knows whether or not he has enough time or space to do it, if not he can always chose to pass to the Skrtel or one of the midfielders/wingbacks. 


Our risk taking with forward passes is one of the better results from this season and it mainly comes from Sakho (and now Can) trust in the midfield. Do any of you not recall the complete shit chemistry our defense and midfield had where Coutinho/Hendo/Gerrard drop back and they are still not trusted with the ball? I rather Sakhos method of passing to players under pressure so they can pull their markets out of position even if it means the ball comes back to the defense.


The other thing Sakho does is his willingness to keep possession even if it is difficult, he will protect a still ball for 30 sec if it means he gets to pass it to Skrtel or Moreno, other defenders see the attack 1 yard away from the ball and instinctively clear, he will slow down the attacker or back heel sideways away. 


What is the difference between recycling the ball until we are under pressure and Migs clears it, and when Sakho does 50 yard pass at the feet of our very technical players, at least with Coutinho/Sterling/Lallana/Markovic etc. we have a high chance of keeping the ball vs the constant loss of possession when we clear the ball. 


Sakho and Can are BR ideal, not for their defending, but their willingness to put themselves in awkward positions rather than clearing the ball, and most of the times we keep possession or they get throw in.


I think some people here need to rewatch some of our old games where we had faux possession and were in complete fear of pressure, with Can and Sakho our defenders don't collapse under pressure, our midfielders play dangerous last second passes that result in counter attacks. The fact that we play so many midfielders makes it possible, so please watch some of the older matches and see just how easy we collapsed under pressure and compare to the recent touchline duels with Can and Sakho.",null,0,null,1423666390,null,0,false,0,coi5b0q,null,t3_2vizbg,null,t1_coi5b0q,null,t3_2vizbg,null,null,null,1424530079,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

The designation of resources based on what some group of high up civil servants think the resources should go is a fundamental issue in the NHS; that and the further consequence that there is no incentive to improve the efficiency of this allocation due to the simple fact that the employees will gain nothing from putting work into it. Sure, the government can set some arbitrary quota; but what does that do? Well all it does is allows a hospital to get away with having efficiency at that quota (hardly a good position) or it aritrarily punishes what the government sees as 'low performing' hospitals; when Infact they might be perfectly functioning. But what is a good measure that is not arbitrary and requires no governmental oversight or any form of organising body? Profit. The incentive to make money; the incentive to save more lives and to make better use of  resources than a neighbouring hospital. Why do you care so much why a private company does things? All that matters is the effects of it. The most well-intentioned  government agencies have had some of the worst economic effects on countries in history.

To go onto your next point, why can't we have an insurance based system? We are forced by the government to have car insurance which has the same issue of randomness in it that you just said healthcare has. On the same line, in emergency situations you can't choose your hospital but you can choose your insurance provider, who in a private market have the same incentives to act as the best middleman on the market. Also, did you seriously just use America as an example of a free market healthcare system?

null,false,stranglekelp,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"Hi. Don't want to hijack the thread, but it is highly relevant for me, so maybe someone can guide to the right direction as I have had no luck with the police or the council. Like in the text, they just keep sending me around.

I am fairly sure my landlord will try to trick me in order to not give me my deposit back upon moving out. Am I allowed to have the the whole thing recorded without telling her and her husband when they come down to discuss it?

Some say I can, some say I can't, and the Internet is equally useful.

I got into renting this through a course of bad luck and timing, and things just went bad to worse in a very quick time. Ad had broadband included in the price, to which they said it was obviously a mistake, but we can get their internet for extra £10 a month.

Not having much choice my spouse and I said okay. We only planned to be there short term, so we bit our tongue about that bit. Then she also says it's only possible without a contract, and without bank transfers. They want the rent every month in cash, but they will give no receipts.

Again, our alternative was to be homeless, so we went along with it. I also have reason to believe that when I would be at work, and if my spouse would be out, they would come down, because we paid attention to how things were left out, but this we can't prove.

Two months before moving out (we leave on 16th) she starts bringing other people to view the flat. She didn't really care about the schedule, she would just have people coming and going whenever she wants, and sometimes she would even call us up not even 30 minutes before someone is supposed to check the ""flat"" (basically a basement in their own house).

We all the time had to explicitly say she is not allowed to let people in if we are not at home, but she didn't see any problem with that, she would just say ""it's okay, I will let them in""

Additionally, she cuts down our internet when she needs it, and pretends the cable was accidentally disconnected, or that the router was resetting (since we have access to the router, we could see this is not true). They are also loud, stomp around all the time, and generally just don't care.

The pinnacle of everything was recently when they just left for almost two full weeks, and just switched all of the heating off, leaving us in the coldest possible weather, and the basement is so badly isolated (there are, really, some cracks in the wall around the windows where the outside air easily seeps in). We are only given a microwave, and all we could do was to stay in jackets all the time, and sometimes heat up the microwave oven to warm up our hands, until they came back from whatever holidays they went to, and finally turned on the heating (for their part of the house, we just get bits and pieces from it)

We also have reasons to believe that they are now, prior to us leaving soon, withdrawing our post, as we haven't received anything for a long time, (and we definitely should have) and we are fairly certain they will try to trick us out of the deposit.

As they are all the time at home, and have 4 children, I'm fairly sure they may be on some, if not all kinds of, benefits, and are probably not allowed to rent it. But, like I said, council and the police didn't care about this either, they just referred us to other people, until when we finally made a full circle back to them, they just told us to contact our embassies so they help us (we're EU citizens).

I've been sent home from a&amp;e in pain I don't think any cancer patient would be left in. I also had a severely torn meniscus in my knee which was not operated on for 10 years. The list goes on.

From the time I was in unbearable pain and was dismissed, my parents really emphasised how much I would cover it up as soon as a doctor appeared. It was quite a traumatic experience that played on my mind for years after and so I made a decision to be more assertive and vocal when I was experiencing a problem. It can feel uncomfortable at first, but I feel drs have taken things more seriously since I've spoken up more. Plus, for people like us, our version of speaking up, is just bringing it to the normal level.

Just make a decision to be a little more emphatic. Also, be detailed when they ask questions. If you have a doctors appointment, think about it ahead of time and even make a list of symptoms if you think you might forget something that could be important. Often with a lot of issues, doctors go off what you tell them and your reaction in terms of pain to build up a picture.

Strikers often do this to disrupt the back line and pull up or move about to confuse whichever defender is by him, its simple striker movement and hard for a lineman to judge.

If there were 6 jobs available - an entry-level office job, a part time heritage job, a hairdresser, a customer assistant in an offie, a waitress in a cafe, and a cleaner - she'd tell me to apply for the waitressing, off-license, and cleaner jobs as part of my ""goals"" for the next meeting, rather than stopping to think for 1 second, recognising that I was a graduate with an interest in history, and suggesting that the three I should apply for were the office, heritage and waitressing jobs because of my experience and interests.

Point is this: my advisor seemed not to take into account what qualifications and experience I had or what I was most interested in.

&gt;The __Danelaw__, as recorded in the *[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle)* (also known as the __Danelagh__; [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English): *Dena lagu*;  [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language): *Danelagen*), is a historical name given to the part of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) in which the laws of the [Danes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe\)) held sway  and dominated those of the [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons). It is contrasted with [West Saxon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_law) and [Mercian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadripartitus). The term has been extended by modern historians to be geographical. The areas that constituted the Danelaw are in northern and eastern England. The origins of the Danelaw arose from the [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking) expansion of the ninth century AD, although the term was not used to describe a geographic area until the 11th century AD. With the increase in population and productivity in [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia), Viking warriors, having sought treasure and glory in the nearby [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles), ""proceeded to plough and support themselves"", in the words of the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, for the year 876.

I have never mentioned benching Mason or Bentaleb, nor have i talked about Pochettinos lineup before the game. It seemed reasonable enough to field the same starting eleven that played so well against Arsenal. You could have questioned Masons fitness before the game, but i'm pretty sure they tested him.

It's not hindsight to question Pochettinos adjustments and subs when the game is on. I'm pretty much just summing up the same thing that was being said during the game.

As you say the area should have been supported by Vertonghen/Mason/Bentaleb when Eriksen isn't there, but they clearly struggled to do so. We could not control the game and Liverpool looked much more likely to score. Thus the need for some adjustments, that didn't happen.

It's those adjustments midgame that i'm critizising Pochettino for not doing. He did nothing to relieve some of the pressure on Rose and it eventually ended in a penalty and a goal. It was something you could see coming miles away.

I think we could have done a couple of things, that we didn't do. We could have moved Dembele back into CM, Eriksen to CAM and Chadli/Townsend on LW. We could even have moved Rose to LW or a straight swap with Davies in LB. We could also have dropped our backline deeper to make it harder for Liverpool to run behind our backline.

I think most things would have been better than bringing in Paulinho in CM and after that subbing out Eriksen. The last Soldado sub was a hail mary.

That said, he's aggressive and strong, but reasonably comfortable with the ball at his feet. He needs to work on his footballing brain a bit and make better choices, he doesn't read the game particularly well. I think he lost all his confidence earlier this season and suffered greatly from it. Rodgers has pulled him out of the side for a while now to get him back to basics and learning the Liverpool way of playing.  I think we are going to see Lovren come back into the side looking fresh of body and mind now and begin to play a lot better. 

The improvement will come from the hard work I'm sure he's done on the training pitch and in the classroom, but also from the system. All of our defenders looked shit early on because they didn't have a midfield in front of them that could do anything. The new formation, with a far more solid center of the pitch and bruiser like Lucas or Can protecting the back line is set up to help a player like Lovren. His best seasons came with a strong midfield in front of him (Scheiderlin/Wanyama at Soton and Toulalan at Lyon). He hasn't worked out yet,  but he's not a lost cause and I bet he's hungry for redemption.

You sound like you have a wealth of experience in a variety of different areas. Not many people do.

This will have given you an idea of what you like and what you don't. Thats a huge first step. It will save a lot of dithering. 

Secondly, I am making a huge jump here, but I am assuming that you don't have dependants. I figure that if you did you would have mentioned it.

This means that outside of work you have free time to put your shoulder into what you want to do.

Knowing where you want to go, the next thing is thinking about the first step. Want to go into IT, what role in IT and what do you need to get that first foot in the door in IT - then use your free time to study IT.

[Here](https://techtickal.wordpress.com/education/programming-education) is a resource of as many free courses as I was able to find. My blog is not yet 'launched' and is aimed more at people aiming to get into financial markets, but the point I want to emphasise is that there is a hell of a lot of free educational shit out there.

From my perspective, education and experience is everything, and education is usually a great way to get experience. The main thing is that people look for initiative. 

I think one of the big challenges you face is what to do with your free time. Doing a dead end job kills your confidence and can inspire you to go and spunk your wages on the weekend in a bar or on a bag of sticky-icky.

Zouma's speed also allows him to cover more ground when Ivanovic bombs forward. 

Cahill is fabulous if we are playing a more conservative style, defensive minded, he's much better on the ball, you can tell Zouma is uncomfortable and still learning, and plays a lot of unnecessary clearances instead of keeping possession.

null,false,TheBraveTroll,ni,Northern Ireland,null,"&gt;This is exemplified by monopolies.

You mean like the NHS?

Where do you think monopolies come from? Give me a modern day example of a private monopoly in Britain and I can guarantee there is a piece of government legislation either keeping it there or put it there in the first place. The only true private monopoly that has ever existed in the world and lasted unlinked to a government has been the Stock Exchange.

&gt;They don't care how much wastage occurs if their profits are high enough and they certainly don't cater to consumer wants and needs.

How can you possibly say this? Who actually believes this crap? An employer never says ""right ok my profits are high enough I think I'll just leave it there"". If there is unnecessary waste production worthy of expending labour and resources on in order to fix the problem then that labour and resources will be allocated in a manner that will not affect current services to the customer (eg. it will be done over a longer period). And what happens in a public system? Where are the humanists in the system who suddenly, because they are in a public system, rise up and fix all the problems at the expense of their labour and money? Do you honestly believe this happens to an extent that it keeps the system running? No. What keeps a public doctor going to work is the same thing as a private doctor; money. The difference is is that a public system will lack proper indicators and incentives in order to improve a service. Why? Because arbitrary guidelines and quotas do not improve a service. They give absolutely no indication of whether a hospital is functioning efficiently or not. If we take a public hospital, say they can't have a death rate of 40 per year, a number that has been set by the government, and if they reach or surpass that figure, then they are shut down. (I could search up some accurate figures but they are irrelevant, what matters is the principles). People don't like death rates, because funnily enough we don't like people to die. But say the hospital manages never to get past that figure; sounds good right? As long as they don't surpass that figure, they are a 'functioning hospital', according to the government. Sure, they may reach a death rate of 35, but what does it matter? They aren't going to be shut down because they are a 'functioning hospital'. Why would the employees care? They just want their pay check; no one wants to see people die, but they want to get on with their lives. They aren't going to donate some of their pay check to the hospital. Should high up bosses care? Again, they don't want to see people die, but they have a hospital to run, and if they get their fixed budget from the government in order to run it then they aren't going to find a way to improve their services because why would they? They have lives; same as the employees. And customers? Well they sure as hell don't like the sound of a death rate of 35 but what are they going to do? They have no choice of product. All they can do is go to a different NHS hospital with the same system set up.

&gt;You can't apply the economic logic of a supermarket to a hospital and expect it to work.

Who says this? Why can't you?

&gt;Supermarkets are designed to give people everything in one place but don't for one minute think that the supermarket wants to give you what you want.

Supermarkets are designed to meet demand; a public supermarket would be designed to meet expected demand (bit of a jump but if you want to see how publicly owned supermarkets worked then go no further than the good old USSR; the same principles apply).

&gt;but don't for one minute think that the supermarket wants to give you what you want.

Why not? You're seriously pulling crap out of your ass. If I'm not getting what I truly want then I have the choice to take my money and go to another supermarket. Sure, if I want a purple orange and the supermarket doesn't sell one then the supermarket sure as hell isn't going to fund the R&amp;D in order to get me one; but that's because for millions invested into R&amp;D I am still only going to be willing to pay the price of a regular orange for their purple orange; therefore the supermarket does not do it. But if I was willing to pay millions for the purple orange? Then yes; they would do it. Think about this principle, cos I might come back to it.

&gt;If they could, they'd force a high priced good down your throat and then make you cough up the money to buy it to maximise their profits.

If they could? Well they might. But can they? No. Supermarkets are not held up by the government; they have no coercive power to force you to buy their products, and there is also no national, government owned supermarket that has a monopoly over the whole of Britain (neither is there a private monopoly, and never will be unless some form of legislation is passed that favours one company).

&gt;They place goods that they want to sell at eye level so you notice and pick them up,

What in God's name has this got to do with public vs private? You seem to be drifting wildly. This is not a coercive technique; in the same way that drug labelling in hospitals is designed to be as intuitive as possible; it has absolutely fuck all to do with a private or public source.

&gt;they advertise copiously 

Again, there is nothing within advertisements that screams coercion or monopoly. That's like saying 'I see an advert for one brand of aftershave but not every brand of aftershave therefore I am being forced to buy that brand of aftershave.'

&gt;to get you to buy things you don't really need or want.

Who decides what we need and want? Have you seen what happens to countries where the government thinks they know what we 'need and want'? Just look at the USSR's handling of that; it's a real socialist utopia.

&gt;Now think about what you're saying. The government wants to introduce these exact principles to hospitals on the account of ""efficiency savings"". It's not a good idea for patients at all.

This doesn't make sense after what I just said.

&gt;Except a private system won't give you any more options, as I explained elsewhere in this thread, you will never have two hospitals side by side competing for patients because it's lunacy

How is it 'lunacy'? What is insane about it? It scares me that you think it's 'insane' to give customers a choice in what company should save their life or improve it. There are private companies that have structures side by side in similar fields with much higher costs-of-entry than a hospital in our world.

Come off it, are you telling me people wouldn't still try to get the max they possibly can? I often see this argument, but it makes no sense. Whether there is 5k, 10k or 20k in it for someone, they will always go for it... especially if they are rich. Money is money, and they want more money.

This is just an extension of the ""trickle down economics"" argument, which has now been shown to be great at getting an elite rich, but shit at spreading it around.

&gt;And from an ideological perspective, sarcastically talking about 'those poor rich people' doesn't hide the fact that the stance you adopt assumes the right to seize the assets of others to suit your own agenda. It's the politics of envy.

Or is it the politics of expecting people to give things back? They have massively benefited off the backs of all of us through lower taxes and bank bailouts, they doubled their wealth while the rest of us lost out or stayed the same. Now I want them to pay their share back, that's not envy.

Calling it the politics of envy is a really questionable defence of someone having 3 private jets while other people literally starve to death in the same country. It's almost as though you can't defend it morally, so have to rely on calling me envious. FWIW, I am in the highest tax bracket, I am not jealous.

It's useful for elective surgery with a long waiting list. I used my insurance to pay for a family member. It did mean that we needed to choose a hospital and surgeon. I don't have the expertise to do that, but luckily I know a couple of consultant surgeons who were able to advise.  They both advised me to pick a hospital as close as possible to an NHS hospital, in case anything went horribly wrong. 

On the other hand I recently needed some quite complex eye surgery. I asked the consultant whether it would be worth going private and he said that I'd get the same consultant, same anaesthetist, same timescale, and on balance would be better done via the NHS. 

The other option is paying cash. I have some mates who did this, and it turned out that private hospitals are surprisingly amenable to negotiations. One of them described it as a bit like getting your car fixed: an insurance job costs a lot more than a cash job.

null,false,Callduron,null,null,null,"I'd like to mention the National Careers Service where I work as a careers adviser. (Apologies if this seems self-interested).

The National Careers Service is funded by the government (mainly) to give free impartial careers advice to UK citizens. For me a typical interaction with a customer is that they call the call centre, spend about 10 minutes explaining to my colleagues why they want careers help and giving us their details then they're either transferred to me or one of the advisers or booked in for a call back. (If they want advice by phone, it's also possible to book face to face). I then conduct an interview with them that takes 20-30 minutes and then write it up as a report called a skills action plan which I email to my customer. We may follow up by doing cv work or a mock interview as appropriate.

Now there's a bewildering amount of people out there seeming to want to rework your cv for free so they can claim money off the government and I need to explain why we're different.

Careers advice is about your career, your lifelong professional development, not just about getting you back into paid work asap. In some cases grabbing the first job you can find isn't the best route forward for an individual.

Let me give two examples of customers I've helped.

The first man came to see me where I was working at a Jobcentre a few months back. He had been signing on for years and they were pushing him to apply for cleaner or warehouse work. He had no desire to do such work. I asked him what he wanted to do if he could do any job he wanted and he didn't know. So I asked him to tell me about stuff he'd done when he was younger that he liked doing. He remembered working in a bookshop and suggested tentatively that he might like to be a proofreader. I then looked up how people become proofreaders and we talked about it. I suggested he could set up online and offer proofreading and we talked about the explosion in self-published novels on sites like Amazon. Once he had a few positive references from authors he could start charging. I talked about how professional proofreaders get hired by traditional publishers (it turns out it's usually people who already work at the publisher in a more junior capacity). So I asked him if he'd consider taking work as a publishing assistant as a stepping stone to get him where he wants to be. He was up for that. So we talked about looking for work in publishing and about targeting his cv (designing his cv so he has a version that's particularly appealing for publishing jobs). So in the end we came up with a strategy where he'd develop his skills online working with authors self-publishing while looking for entry level work in the publishing industry. No reason not to pursue both routes at once. Then we ran out of time but he left with a bit of a spring in his step.

Another customer wanted to be a computer repairman. I realised he wasn't actually very good with computers. So I asked him how he'd feel about being at a client's office screwdriver in hand with a machine he wasn't sure how to fix with no one to ask. He felt he would be completely out of his depth. So I suggested that what he could do is get there gradually. I explained about first line support. He had a background in call centre work which would make him a good candidate for a position giving phone support. He was sick of call centres so it wasn't what he wanted exactly but it would get him into the field of solving computer problems and the experience and contacts could help move him on to the next level. He agreed that it would be worthwhile for him to do helpdesk work as a stepping stone to where he really wanted to be. In the end we identified that to get where he wanted to be he'd need to do a course in computers to get to the level where he could do confident telephone support then get a job doing it then get another course teaching him computer repair then look for work or start up as a computer repairman. It wasn't quite what he had come in wanting but it was a realistic and achievable route to his long term career goal.

I'm a relative rookie in the service but I love helping people and feel like I'm really useful to people. I've had some great feedback from customers. I used to work in employment advice - this is different and better.

If this sounds like something that would be useful to you then here's our site: https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx

Ultimately though the onus is on you. You have to figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life (and it's fine to change, we meet career changers all the time). You have to identify your goal then figure out the steps you need to take to open the doors (maybe a course, maybe a lesser job that will open the door to the job you really want). But I think it can be really positive for people to see that they're working through steps that are taking them where they want to be. Even when it doesn't work out it makes it easier to reassess then go for a new goal.",null,0,null,1423672121,null,0,1423672857,0,coi8esm,null,t3_2viiov,null,t1_coi8esm,null,t3_2viiov,null,null,null,1424531940,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

WR633 We support the formation and growth of cooperatives as a way of encouraging a democratic and non- hierarchical approach to work. We also encourage co-operatives to have strong links with the community and the people they trade with, and to encourage and enable high levels of member participation.

WR634 We recognise that the bottom-up development of cooperatives is often more appropriate than the use of legislative devices, when seeking to establish a system of industrial democracy in those sectors of the economy dominated by small firms, sole traders or systems of (sub) contracting.

WR635 We would maintain a comprehensive network of co-operative development agencies working with the whole range of mutual businesses, including community businesses, services run by their users, LETS and other community finance initiatives and consumer co-ops as well as worker co-ops. We would also see them providing a stronger trading link between cooperatives, Green councils and other Green movement organisations.

WR636 We encourage cooperatives to develop federated structures rather than grow in such a way that it threatens their democratic ethos and links with the community.

WR637 A Green Government will prioritise the setting up of cooperatives in sectors of the economy from which they are traditionally excluded and which have low union membership.

WR638 We would encourage trade unions to explore the use of cooperative structures and systems of mutual aid.

WR639 The consumer cooperative is one of the best expressions of a process of consumer awakening and should be encouraged as a step towards real consumer power. We support such cooperatives because they are founded on the principles of mutual aid, and are one way of breaking the monopoly of retailing held by a small group of multinationals. We should ensure that workers within such organisations are given a significant say in the running of the company, particularly in how the work is done.

Not really.

The UK is extremely car centric. Many don't likes any implementation of anything (speed cameras, one ways, bus/cycle lanes) that might slow them down or change the status quo. 
Many have spent good money on their car, and they want to use it and are often unsympathetic to reasons not to.

Then you have various influential groups ( Institute of Advanced Motorists/RAC) that  go out of their way to promote cars at the cost of everyone else.

We also know that motorists are by far and away cause the most congestion. But I bet good money that very very few of them acknowledge it.

&gt;The attitudes (and awareness) of some motorists need to change. The attitudes (and awareness) of some cyclists need to change too

No disagreement from me there. But bad cyclists wont be the ones putting people (or kids) off cycling.

&gt;All road users need to be aware of the potential dangers to themselves and to other road users.

I agree fully. Many have said motoring has been normalized to the point many fail, or forget that its probably the most dangerous activity they will ever do.

This attitude is not helped by the regular (perhaps just a vocal minority) who do whatever they can to insinuate the victim is the one at fault in car vs pedestrian/cycling accidents.....Not just a motoring issue to be fair.

The most obvious possibility is that Labour win so few seats in Scotland that we're not the largest party in Westminster, Cameron forms a government and the SNP don't even get the opportunity to suggest a coalition with Labour.

There's also the possibility that Labour and the Conservatives will have the same or almost the same number of seats, in which case the Conservatives would almost certainly have more votes (even if they had slightly fewer seats). Neither Labour or the Tories would have a majority but the Tories could argue that with a larger vote share they had a right to try and form a government first.

The first thing the job centre needs to do, is to change it's structure from a one size fits all, to a set of more narrow specialisms to suit different needs. They should have graduate, skilled unemployed, unskilled unemployed and a difficult circumstances/extra help needed (disabled, long term unemployed ect) sections at the minimum with specialists in each area and programs designed for each area. 

Then within each section they should have people who work locally with business and build strong relationships which are mutually beneficial, giving them an insight into local needs and potential skills training identification for relevant areas. 

Then they need to work with skills providers in various levels to give short intensive training schemes that business needs and will get people into relevant jobs as soon as people are signing on. 

An example might be putting 10 suitable graduates into an intensive two week scheme to gain sold database manipulation skills with employers able to recruit from those completing it. 

Or a group scheme for out of work tradespeople to network with potential employers once a month, with incentives to use them for work trials ect. 

Until governments stop looking at the dole queue as an uncomfortable statistical liability and start seeing it as a potential untapped resource we are just going to keep going around in circles. 

The reality is that everyone who is unemployed deep down wants to work and has some level of ambition, even if their current situation has left them feeling depressed, demotivated and sceptical of the private sector.

So in the UK's cases the court has said that the near-blanket ban is a breach, but in another case they've ruled that Italy's ban (based on the severity of the crime and length of the sentence, iirc) is Ok. The 'limit' of what is acceptable is somewhere in between. But that is more of a band; the ""margin of appreciation."" The ECtHR recognises that different countries have different histories/cultural backgrounds - so even though the Court's position is that people shouldn't be denied the right to vote unless there's a specific reason for it (such as a conviction for electoral fraud), they accept that some countries may have a history of denying all prisoners the vote, and that should be taken into account.

On checks on the ECtHR; there are 5ish main ones - three from the ECHR's perspective, two domestic.

* the ECtHR isn't responsible for enforcing its judgments - it merely gives the rulings. Responsibility for that rests with the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. So in the case of prisoner voting, the Committee has been bending over backwards the give the UK government the chance to 'fix' things. It's been nearly a decade, with at least one deadline imposed by the ECtHR, but so far nothing has happened.

* during enforcement proceedings it is generally enough for a Government to say that it did their best to fix the problem but couldn't get it past their democratic legislature (the ECHR recognises the importance of democracy). This probably won't help in the prisoner voting issue as David Cameron has made his position against it very strongly and very clearly.

* ultimately the Council of Europe can amend the Convention if they feel the Court has made some odd decisions and it needs changing.

* Domestically, the rulings of the ECtHR aren't binding, merely persuasive - domestic courts don't have to follow them. For example in the whole life tariffs case, the ECtHR said the law wasn't clear so was a violation. The Court of Appeal disagreed, saying that the law was clear and the ECtHR had misunderstood (which they hadn't - it was a bit political with an issue of practicality v legal theory going on). The ECtHR in a follow-up case effectively thanked the Court of Appeal for clearing things up and saying things were fine.

* finally, Parliament gets the final say. No matter what the ECtHR or even domestic courts (in theory) say, Parliament makes the law and decides what is legal. The worst the Council of Europe can do is kick the UK out. Again, prisoner voting shows this quite clearly; the ECtHR has repeatedly ruled that the ban is a violation, and a decade later prisoners still can't vote - because Parliament says so.",null,0,null,1423674017,null,0,false,0,coi9j7v,null,t3_2veh2l,null,t1_coi9j7v,null,t1_coi0y4b,null,null,null,1424532465,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Off my head:

S Korea (even North as a post I made recently) has the E2 visa the minimum requirement is an accredited bachelors degree.

Taiwan needs a BA/Bsc degree you cannot get the ARC without it. Forumosa has lots of posts about deportations.

Hong Kong doesn't strictly need a degree but the company hiring has to make a case to the immigration department as to why a local or HKID holder can't do it. Special education is such a consideration in making a case.

Vietnam introduced their 4 year degree requirement scheme quite recently.

Thailand again lots of illegals on visa runs abusing the visa on arrival thing but to get a legit visa needs a degree. Which is why back in September there was a big scare of all the illegals when visa running was to be banned.

China requires a degree for the legal paperwork for the Z visa the only exception is the X visa but this has to be approved by the PSB of the city you're living in. IIRC Chengdu allows it.

The exceptions are:

Japan as 18-30 can get round it via a working holiday visa or the contractor scheme.
Cambodia
Myanmar


Here is a quote from /r/china:

&gt; To me (being a teacher) that means that you are teaching at a high-school (hopefully international school), using a well made, scientifically created curriculum and methodology, working regular hours for a reputable school which treats you like any other well regarded teacher. You give grades and tests to your students and those grades / tests are recorded to the students accademic record.

&gt; If your situation is not this, then I'm sorry... you should not be proud of it. Because it's all bullshit. Teachers are not employing any higher skills...just talking and having conversations. They are mostly not teaching. The students are mostly not there to learn as we understand what learning is. Teachers are entertainers...dancing monkey... who are most often also exploited by the academies they work for. Often the teachers' ignorance allows them to be exploited.


So sure they may be 'teachers' but they are essentially illegal immigrants and therefore have few rights, lower pay and can be exploited as much as their employers want. While at the same time their options are becoming increasingly limited. As overtime each country tightens up its visa requirements and enacts things like dob in a illegal migrant (which has been happening in Taiwan for ages especially with illegality of kindergarten teaching only special licensed Taiwanese people can do that).

&gt; There is a lot of demonization of ZHC on this sub about the abuses of people on them but it seems the majority are okay with the hours.
&gt; 35% are not, but to what extent? Can make assumptions based off the wording of the other 3 options but it would only be assumption.

There is some survey knocking about out there that shows people on zero hour contracts are typically happier than people on full time contracts.

I had one during uni and it was perfect for me, because I had a good employer. They weren't annoyed if I said I couldn't work during exam time, it wasn't held against me. 

/r/uk seems to look at things in a black and white way sometimes..banning them altogether would be a really bad decision in my opinion and disregards all the people who have them and are happy on them.

Converting the first class tickets into cattle-class isn't going to reduce that by millions. People are getting pent up that it's tens of thousands wasted on first class.

It isn't. Even standard class costs a lot. They're quoting the total value spent on those tickets. Not the differential between standard/first.

Should they be spending the extra? Debatable. They might have got a good deal. First might have been the cheapest ticket.

I wouldn't expect the job centre staff to only suggest graduate jobs. I would expect it to prioritise jobs more suited to my qualifications and experience over jobs that will obviously not hire me, rather than the other way round.

It's like if a job centre advisor with a client who has a fork lift truck license ignored all the FLT jobs and instead pushed the secretarial jobs. It's not about being above certain jobs or being picky - as I have said, I'd have happily accepted any job I was offered, and applied to every job going that didn't require qualifications I didn't have, including cleaning jobs - it's about the job centre advisor failing to recognise my strengths and weaknesses and tailor her advice and the goals she set for me to those.

Splendid. What penalities? Who is in charge of enforcing these changes? Assuming HMRC, are they going to receive increased funding (yes, yes, I know about ROE of chasing these things, but they are severely short-staffed at the moment and you can only shuffle so many staff around). Likewise the police and CPS if charges are to be pressed in court are we going to fund a proper financial crimes unit? Regionally or as part of the NCA?

Without detail this is bluster. 

&gt;Close loopholes used by hedge funds to avoid stamp duty and loopholes like the Eurobonds loophole that allow some large companies to avoid Corporation Tax

The Eurobond Loophole has been in place since 1984. Scrapping Intermediaries Relief will do nothing more than drive up transaction costs, which in turn will drive up fees and lower returns for investors. That's pension funds, by the way, not just billionaires. 

Headline-grabbing nonsense. 

&gt;Scrap the “Shares for Rights” scheme, which the OBR has warned could enable avoidance

tbh it's largely ignored by business, the only people taking it up are start-ups (who routinely offer shares to early employees in lieu of salary) and executives who receive shares anyway. No harm in scrapping it, no real up-side either. 

&gt;Require dormant companies to report to HMRC more frequently to stop them avoiding tax

Companies House is not set up for Forensic Accounting, that's not their function. Dormant Companies are dormant, they have no significant transactions in the year... if HMRC want to look at them, that's fine, it's an easy-check, increased filing just adds costs to non-business. At the moment it's a £13 fee once per year to file any accounts at all (thus equipment remaining part of the business, and potentially not having to pay cap gains or other costs for winding it up). I don't know what they're proposing specifically, but it's a non-solution to a non-problem. This isn't corporations avoiding millions, it's the man-with-van who gets a job... he still has the van and whatever tools, he's just not chasing work at the moment. 

&gt;Force the UK’s Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to produce publicly available registries of beneficial ownership

Most already do, those who don't won't, and we can't force them to do a sodding thing. 

In order for avoidance measures to be effective they're going to have to be widespread, it's going to have to be continents at a time, not nations, the OECD recommendations are a solid foundation, but nobody's working on them, nobody's talking about how you get Somalia or Iran or the Caymans to join you.

However, training for even the *MOST BASIC* first aider should know that any fall from a height of two of you, and/or loss of consciousness and/or any hazy memory or non - contextual responses is an immediate 999 call to have the NHS Ambulance service check you out. So assuming that you or your fellow footballers mentioned you being knocked out that should have set alarm bells ringing.

So - moving on to your other issues. Everyone's pain threshold is different, and everyone deals with injury differently, however it is up to the trained medics to determine likely injuries from the history of the event (""why have you come to see us today?"") and any diagnostic equipment at their disposal.

If you presented at hospital with a painful collarbone area an X-Ray would seem to be in order. That should either prove or disprove a fracture.

I can't argue with that. It's a fair enough point and is quite true. The only thing I'd say is, is the current system any better? It was ""advertised"" as such but have we really evolved? I still travel home on a train carriage that was built in the 70's/80's to serve British Rail, as a consumer, I haven't seen that many changes other than the outside of the train changes colour every now and then. It's beginning to change now with more modern carriages coming in but I wouldn't be surprised to find out that they are subsidised purchases. Of course, if they remain the property of the government and the TOC's basically rent the hardware then it's another thing entirely.

Trains are still late on around half the occasions I travel and fares are going up and on more than one occasion I've had to take a taxi because a train was full/inadequate number of carriages. I'm not blaming the franchise owners but It's a poor show from the govt. to promise these things wouldn't happen and then they inevitably do. Unfortunately, I don't really have an answer. Like you say, the government is still heavily involved with the service and to be honest, I think a halfway house that we have is actually detrimental to development. For starters it should be one way or another but regulation retained in the case of privatisation (for the sake of passengers), in a more loose fashion than it is. Again, this is me living on cloud 9. I haven't particularly sat and thought this though and I seriously doubt whether or not I'll ever be in a situation to do anything about it.

&gt;The train companies are basically staffing agencies that occasionally do a bit of train maintenance.

Isn't the maintenance of most of the kit the duty of network rail? Certainly the lines are. I'm not sure if the carriages come as part of the rental package along with the exclusive franchise and even then I'm not 100% who actually has the duty to fix the things when they break down.

Shower gel, exfoliants, even shampoo bubbles can all be an issue.

Avoid harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates) and anything alkaline (soap, baking soda), go easy on rough gloves and granular scrubs - if you see redness you have caused irritation/ inflammation. Do not soap up dry areas each day, a water wash is fine for legs and arms. Do not overwet or soak the skin because this flushes out the Natural Moisturising Factors.

Ingredients to look for in a body cream include 10% urea, lactic acid, lanolin, ceramides/ cholesterol/ cholesterol esters/ phytosphingosine, oils rich in linoleic acid such as sunflower. Avoid oils and butters rich in oleic acid. Good brands include CeraVe (Amazon), Eucerin, Flexitol (hand balm or foot cream not body lotion), Balneum Cream (not the PLUS).

Lastly review your diet and lifestyle choices, at this time of year especially your intake of essential fatty acids and bioavailable vitamin D. Foods rich in these include oily fish, whole eggs, seeds such as pumpkin and chia: experts recommend up to four servings of oily fish a week.

null,false,mushroomgodmat,null,null,null,"&gt;Cyclists injured 21 pedestrians per billion km travelled in 2012 compared with 24 pedestrians injured by drivers.

that article has been discusses before. 

Its actually flawed in that its not always a fair comparison to compare different modes of transport via distance traveled.

If you do for example (I believe) HGVs are safer than cars - which of course in many ways that are until they get into the city and they become more dangerous than anything else on the roads.

Likewise, buses are (I believe) one of the most dangerous modes of transport because they spend all their time interacting with pedestrians and not clocking up miles like HGVs.



So - comparing cyclists who spend 99% their miles in towns and cites with cars who have the benefit of B roads, A roads and motorways where their miles wont bring them into conflict with any people, is not an equal and fair comparison.


A more fair way to compare it is by model share. Cyclists account (nationally) for 2pc of traffic but do not contribute to 2pc of deaths/accidents. Or, you simply compare like for like habits - for example miles done by car in the city vs miles done on bike in the city.

&gt;I don't believe im ever going to be harmed by a cyclist acting like a twat

Should probably start by explaining how government debt works. It's *not* like your own credit card debt.

The government sells *bonds*. These are effectively fixed rate, fixed term IOU's. Pre-determined payments are made in between, nothing is *paid down* over time, no variable interest is applied. 

For example; You could buy a bond today for £100. It has a 5 year maturity and a rate of 4%. This means you will be paid £4, £4, £4, £4, £104. 

So when people say ""*We're paying off interest*"" it is only kind of true, we're in the process of settling very fixed and known debts. The government doesn't just *choose* to pay off some extra debt when there's spare cash, how much goes out and when is known for years ahead.

The government is never going to miss a bond payment date so they're incredibly reliable investments *but* because of that very low interest.

That makes them ideal for things like pension funds, trusts, savings etc. People who want their money to grow but with the least risk possible. Then there is foreign countries, huge investment firms and so on. The Bank of England also buys bonds as a way of injecting cash into the economy, quantitive easing, effectively loaning ourselves our own money.",null,0,null,1423681291,null,0,1423688514,0,coie07j,null,t3_2vk6ds,null,t1_coie07j,null,t3_2vk6ds,null,null,null,1424534551,null,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30,null

What has been said is that the chap is diabetic and the acetone on his breath from being hypoglycaemic (or hyper-; not sure) was detected, causing the test to be considered 'failed'.

~~I've also heard whisperings that an employment tribunal ruled in his favour, but TfL aren't giving him his job back. Seeing as they're just unverified whisperings, I'm leaving them in the back of my mind and not taking them into consideration.~~ [Edit: Please ignore, was codswallop.]

Now, with all that said, the first question that was asked was, ""Why are you defending a drunk driver?"" This question - which is definitely loaded - set the tone and context for the later question of ""[Did the driver] fail a breathalyser test? ... Yes or no?""

Very interesting to see Brunt at right back, I would 100% not be opposed to Dyer and Montero switching sides throughout the game. Montero would rip him apart for pace. Interesting they've gone two up top when they had only the one last week against Burnley.

It's a strong lineup from us, and its great to see Routledge back on the team sheet. We have to try and not give away any set pieces and stop the crosses. Similar to our game plan against West Ham.

null,false,mastican42,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,null,"I'll offer some personal perspective for people who maybe don't know what to think about this.

I moved into halls at the start of my first year, after living for 18 years in the comfort of my sleepy town. I didn't drink, never touched drugs, don't like loud music or parties. Don't get me wrong, I like hanging out with friends every now and then I just don't consider partying to be particularly fun. If it's a get together for a birthday then whatever but going out for no reason other than ""because"" or ""having fun"" makes my skin crawl. Please don't think I'm a killjoy, people can have fun in whatever way they choose, I just like tto enjoy my free times in the manner to which I am accustomed and I've met (surprisingly) a lot of people at uni with a similar mindframe; people who enjoy a quiet, academic life compared to a hectic gung ho attitude towards fun.

The first night, I was subject to all these unfamiliar things, full force without warning, preparation or prior knowledge. People talk about how difficult university course are and how much they sap your time but few people will advertise and discuss (to those not in the know) just how out of kilter university life can be compared to school.

Needless to say, I felt hideously uncomfortable for a number of weeks and if I'm honest, I never really got to grips with it. Second year wasn't a whole lot better after I moved into a house with unfamiliar people (I was supposed to live with friends but one got pregnant, one dropped out and another took a year out, so I was left high and dry and had to search for alternative living arrangements at the last minute). Again, these things in varying concentrations afflicted me personally. I know at uni you are supposed to like going out and getting paralytic on whatever substances you can find. I however, never did enjoy this level of decadence and it aggrivated me to a point where I almost dropped out on several occasions. Not because I wasn't academically successful, I was on course for a first class honours in a difficult biological field. The problem was that emotionally, I couldn't deal with the baggage and pressure to conform or die suffering. **EDIT** I understand how I made this sound, and I'm sure people might take offence to it but I didn't mean it that way. I just meant that drunk people aren't always the most considerate souls. You might think it's fun to slam the door at 2 AM and shout and scream at your friends in the corridor but for some people it's seriously stressful and interrupts with established sleeping patterns, revision patters and the like. And let's face it, nobody wants to hear two people having a row. Especially early in the morning.

Third year, I moved into a flat with strict rules regarding no parties, no smoking, certainly no drugs and incentives to keep a generally calm atmosphere for all. It made my life a million times easier. At a time when academically, stress levels went through the roof, I managed to keep my private life as calm as can be expected. If I had to deal with first/second year private stress again in third, I would have dropped out no question. I was at breaking point as it was.

It's not that some people want to screw everyone else. I have no problem with people who drink and screw and have a good time. It's just not me and I personally want to avoid it. I didn't want to press my views on anyone because it's not cool so I sought to find somewhere that let me live in relative peace without screwing with other people's fun. These kinds of places are good for people who just want to learn. University is very expensive after all and people should be allowed to enjoy it in whatever manner they choose.",null,0,null,1423682218,null,0,1423682539,0,coiekwt,null,t3_2vjiir,null,t1_coiekwt,null,t3_2vjiir,null,null,null,1424534819,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

While I agree with you on the criticism that the underlying flaw is badly written legislation, GAAR is so toothless it almost doesn't matter.  It only matters in that it's enough of a blanket for politicians to pretend that they're doing something, where if it didn't exist they might have to address the root problem.

Also...  You can't be prosecuted under GAAR.  The worst case is that a scheme is determined to be abusive and therefore ineffective.  The consequential incorrect return would be a civil, rather than criminal offence.  Due to the way penalties for incorrect returns are calculated, the chances that you'd end up with a significant penalty (in percentage terms) are extremely low.

I believe that the landlady and her family were maybe just oblivious to what they were doing. They didn't seem to comprehend that it was wrong to take someone's stuff. I imagine when you're letting people stay in your house roof you will always feel that at the end of the day, it is your house.

I'd like to think if it went to court the girl would have been fine. But it wasn't worth the stress. I suspect this is what the Macbeth guy relies on.

* Major lacerations and burns.


From personal experience loosing medium areas of skin (palm) and not getting it properly dressed ends in a world of pain and infection. 

I would think that using funds for large scale training in recognising concussions, sprains / breaks and how to treat small partial burns and medium lacerations would be very helpful in taking pressure off of A+E. I know I would attend them.

Well, off the top of my head, here are some of the biggies.

The obvious one, seeing as the subject highlights the ethnic and religious background of the men involved: Islam.  

I thought we were done with segregation, yet women are ushered in through a separate door, kept apart from men.  
I thought that attitude was ejected from the bus when Rosa Parks sat down?  
The sharia arbitrage courts treat women with less equality than men, as per their doctrines.  
Taxing those that discriminate would reduce the spread of the most rampant and most extremist for, the wahhabist elements and their source money from Saudi Arabia would be much more closely monitored after tax audits. 

The mormons:  
Currently there's a bit of an upheaval within the rank and file, with women going so far as to wear trousers to church in protest.  
The LDS church gave a little a short while ago, letting a woman offer one of the prayers during their bi-annual conference.  
The main movement for women's equality is this:  
http://ordainwomen.org/  
The mormons take 10% from the income of faithful members.  
That's net, *before* taxes or deductions for living costs.  
When posed the option of paying bills or tithing, the church encourages tithing.  
The LDS church is the largest foreign landowner in the UK, with enormous farms.  
They've raked in over 9M Euro in subsidies since 2000.

The Catholics also have a lot to lose, and this should lend some weight to their own women ordination movement.

So as we can see, the total budget cost for benefits is £159b, but the VAST majority of that is in-work benefits and pensions - pensions at £74b, housing benefits and council tax benefits, plus minimum income guarantees accounting for around another £29b. JSA is a paltry £4.91b, ESA is around £3.5b. I'm aware that housing benefit and council tax benefits go to both those in and out of work, but I can't find any breakdowns from a quick google. Even if you assume a 50/50 split, the vast majority of the pot is still going to those either in work or retired. 

The total NHS budget is £95.6b.

First of all, most people don't care about being educated or nursed back to health by the System. They don't see the System. They see their parents working hard. They see (typically) their dads coming home late, their moms working nights, they see sacrifices being made, they see hard won happy Christmases and inexpensive holidays to save. They see other kids slacking off while they do their homework, and see that hard work rewards success.

Then they go to university, and are made to pay for it. So so far, they've had a fair start, they've worked hard, and gotten ahead based on their own merit. Then they're told to pay for their education. Society doesn't take an interest any more.

And once they've got their degree, and landed a good job (which they go through working hard, cultivating a CV, networking, and nailing a job interview, they go to the supermarket at the weekend and are ask where something is, only to be faced with a person who they recognise. And that person didn't work hard at school, and they were so useless that they got a shelf stacking job at the supermarket and rose to the lofty rank of senior shelf stacker. And then they look across and see some fatass with her hair up in a shit version of Amy Winehouse's hair smacking her kid round the head, swearing at him for something really banal and childlike.

And you think they're bigots and selfish for wanting to keep their money rather than fund mommy chav's smoking addiction?

Even if they were bigots, it's their money that I don't want to leave the country. Not them per se.

I don't know if they actually took it into consideration, but I did end up in a relatively quieter section of halls. Three floors, and the top floor was full of girls who were up for partying, mine on the second was split 50/50 between guys and girls, and out of the six of us I was the only one who didn't drink.  I only went out once during freshers, and it was the most awkward social outing ever (didn't help that I had really bad social anxiety at the time). I was 17 at the time, which I would tell the union students that were there to help with the freshers, and they said it wouldn't matter. Uh, it mattered to me. Even if I did want to drink, it was illegal. 

At the time I really wish I'd been with people who didn't want to go out and party during freshers, because I think it would've been easier to meet people who would rather stay in or maybe go out for food or the movies. Instead I spent most of freshers week alone, because I was on a completely different schedule to the other girls so they were always out when I got back, and the people I was meeting on my course all lived at home and commuted. Even joining societies would've been pointless, because the social events were always.... You guessed it.... Going to the SU, or to a pub. 

On the other hand, I kind of wonder what it would've been like if my corridor in halls had been full of more outgoing girls (two were computing students and spent a lot of time gaming, the other three were art students and spent a lot of time working) if it would've brought me out of my shell, or taught me any of the social skills I severely lacked. I guess it really depends on how you look at it. 

Those who are saying the point of university is to meet all sorts of different people as a reason not to have non-alcohol accommodations... Just because someone doesn't drink doesn't mean that they're any less of an interesting person! It would probably be a really great thing for a lot of people.

Firstly I would find who their landlord is and email them anonymously. As you're in a block of flats it should be easy to anonomise yourself. I've done this personally and it resulted in a threatening letter being sent to the concerned flat.

Your other option is crimestoppers, once there's a few reports (and as they're anonymous they won't immediately assume they're from the same person) it gives you a bit more ammunition against their landlord.

Best of luck, it's truly awful to have neighbours like that.

I think the biggest weakness you guys had was letting Rose get doubled up on the entire game. He had no support or cover. Can't blame him at all for having a poor game, the tactics did nothing to help him.

Also I think for the first 30mins, you guys played your defensive line too far up the pitch.

Erikson was a defensive liability and far too easy to bypass through out the game. Now I really rate him but this match reminds me of why Mourinho got rid of Mata at Chelsea. Lamela was a animal today especially defensively, put a great shift in and even Harry Kane made a few big challenges, I recall him tracking back to the edge of the Tottenham box to make a great tackle to regain possession.

The substitutions gave me allot of relief. I was very confident after seeing them, especially Soldado. Soldado does nothing for you guys. Always too deep and 2 steps behind the rest of the team.

Was a great match. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Hope your lot can get 4th spot (behind Liverpool obviously) and I hope my rival perspective adds to the conversation.

Aboslutely, if their stereotype of the type of person who receives benefits is ""mommy chav"", they are bigots.

As for your third paragraph, I can't make out if you are agreeing with them and their appraisal of the world or if you are mocking it, because frankly, it reads like satire.

Personally, when I see an OAP being helped out of my doctors office, in to an NHS minibus to take her home, I feel proud that my NI goes towards it. Apparently these sociopaths don't even think about that.

These people want to leave, because they ""feel bad"" about ""mommy chav"", and abandon all the genuinely sick and vulnerable? Of course they are selfish.

&gt;But he, let's tax the hard working people who have dedicated their lives to improving themselves to get a good standard of living. And if you're middle class and feel bad for the poor, then I guess you're just better than the rest of us.

I'm not some selfish fuck who stereotypes everyone receiving benefits as ""mommy chav"" because they are too stupid to think about ""freezing granny"" or ""disabled person"". I'm not an idiot who think only their parents provided everything and the state nothing.

The game has changed, I remember before the crash being able to find work in my town easily. I would go to an agency, apply to a few shops or look in the paper and an application had a pretty good chance of getting you an interview or you could easily get temp work if needed until something came up.

In the last 3 months I've applied for 200+ jobs, contacted all the local agencies and had one interview (will find out next week if I get it). I have experience and a pretty solid education, I can't imagine someone without this having an easier time of it than me. The harsh reality is that the recovery is still taking place and it will be a while until the huge backlog is cleared and the market is even close to the way it was pre-crash in terms of employment. People will need help, it crushes your confidence and motivation when you have worked hard to try and get a job and are constantly rejected and told you are worthless and lazy.

&gt;Initially training in the performing arts at the [Central School of Speech and Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_School_of_Speech_and_Drama), he then entered the fashion business, writing for popular fashion magazines and appearing on various television shows. In 2006, [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4) employed him to present his own television show, *[How to Look Good Naked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Look_Good_Naked)*, which lasted for three series. Moving into other genres, he presented a series of documentaries on social problems among young people, drawing on his personal experiences with obesity and homophobia.

Sadly there are only about three police officers on actual response duty at any one time in the UK. So it would mean that hardly anyone would get caught. 
   
Also most police cars do not contain any speed detection kit that will stand up in court. It's only the fancy traffic cars usually. For example, I have never 'done' anyone for speeding. I've pulled people over and given words of advice or tickets about other things, but if I decided to report someone for speeding I would then have to wait around ages for a traffic unit to turn up so they could calibrate my vehicle. Meanwhile the job screen is filling up with people being harassed on Facebook, and I have to go and deal with them. 
   
Personally I quite like the average speed areas. They work well. Speed bumps in built up areas are remarkably effective too as they force you to slow down or potentially damage your vehicle.

Fear of this is what happened to Greece.

I assumed you ment benching either Bentaleb or Mason as I don't really see how playing Dembele, Mason and Bentaleb just above the back line would do any good. 

&gt; Pochettino did not make the right adjustments to that problem and we gave away a penalty and a goal from that side. 

We were weak on that side against Arsenal as well - see Welbeck's movements. When you said adjustments I assumed you ment before the game as it has been somewhat apparent all season. 

I think we are both in agreement that there were clear areas where we were lacking yesterday. The issue is that I don't think Chadli is 100% yet, neither of us know if Townsend is 100% (or if he is having other issues) and I think the Rose + Davies combination on the left might have left us lacking in other areas and they might not be accustomed to that setup yet. 

Pochettino had less than 3 days to prepare for the game after a heavy game against Arsenal, is he going to risk playing Rose in an unnatural position when the game is 2-2? In the end he makes a straight swap and puts in Paulinho - a questionable but understandable change. Did it work? Definitely not. 

All I am saying is that, all things considered, I understand why he started the team he did, I understand the substitutions he made. In the end I wish we had a quality LW to compensate for not having Chadli at his best and/or I hope Rose improves some of his defensive capabilities + learns to better manage the balance between his offensive/ defensive play.

If you were in a private place for personal use it is fine to keep it for yourself. Only with the permission of the other people in the recording however may you release it or if you believe it to be in the public's best interest. If it is really serious, it can be used in a court of law or by the police in an investigation without the consent of the other people.

If you were in a private place for business use it is fine as above if it is to establish facts or ensure regulatory compliance (or used for training) with a reasonable effort at notifying the others you were recording. If everybody else knew and you overlooked it or assumed they already knew I'd say it's reasonable.


This is my knowledge and is to the best of my ability, however does not constitute as proper legal guidance and as far as possible by law I accept no liability.

I'm aware its only anecdotal evidence, but everyone i speak to says this is a bullshit strike and I doubt very much anyone outside of a core of members will walk out for someone who is dismissed under these circumstances.

I believe in what the union does, and will defend its position and in most cases its methods. They are after all responsible for not only my own excellent working conditions but also many of the employment laws people take for granted. However, action like this just gives the media and the government ammunition with which to turn the public opinion against them. Its very short sighted.

It's very difficult, even as a member to distinguish real information from propaganda, but please be aware that it is in the interest of the government to demonise the unions.

Even from minute to minute you can see how the strategy falters. Our best chances came from accidents: nothing in the Martinez game plan involves Oviedo attacking from the wing, but when it happens he's feeding chances and getting looks. 
Berto needs to take chances and stop strategizing to simply contain the other side.

We were *in the race for the title* last season, not in 7th place with an outside chance of top 4. And have you forgotten how embarrassing our Champions League campaign was?

Our star striker has been out injured, and our second, third and fourth choices have been so bad the manager has elected to go with midfielders up front instead. i.e. we had *no usable strikers*.

We've had games that we've totally bossed, but not won because we couldn't score because our injured star striker is literally the **only** prolific goalscorer in the entire squad.

Sunderland, Basel, Man Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, arguably Madrid, all let off the hook because with ONE player missing, Liverpool can't score.

That's the opposite of depth.

At the start of Poch's reign there was quite a bit of dead weight tho - Benny, Dawson, Lennon, and arguably Capoue (still rate him tho), Kaboul (he probably didn't think so then), Paulinho, Vlad, etc. 

Quality wise I think some of them are a bit too limited and while we need to have a big squad, and I think Poch realises this, it needs to be streamlined. If we kept to the squad we had, I don't think we would win any major trophy or make any major steps forward for that matter either. 

If a lot of those players above get booted off, I think Poch might want to pick up a new CB + another midfielder and a winger and then move someone like Onomah to cover for Eriksen.

He could be great in a back three it's a different type of positioning used than in a back row of four.

 Lucas is injured and supposed to be out for a hot minute, so we could start Can or Allen there and I'm sure we'll see Brendan do both soon enough.

* We're still down two CBs.  If we had Reid or Collins available, Kouyate would have been free to take CDM, and Song would be further forward to make the incisive passes we've grown to expect from him.

* Adrian may have been trying to save his ~~face~~ moneymaker from a hard impact with the ground, but he still handled outside the area.  Deservedly sent off.  Hopefully he learns to stop teasing the opponent's strikers and just collects/clears the damn ball in the future.

* Andy's probably going to be out for the next fuck knows how long, so we're likely to see Sakho and Valencia starting for the foreseeable future.

* No matter how frustrated **we** may feel, imagine how **Saint's** supporters feel right now.  We were effectively down two men and still held onto the point.  That's still worth being happy about, even if the performance wasn't.

i'm not talking about always controlling the ball and instantly turning and moving up the pitch. i'm just talking about using first touch to keep possession/make the correct footballing play. 

i know sometimes hard balls are diffiuclt to control and not ALWAYS the right option (oppossition, score of the game, etc).

the idea is to be trained in the way to receive the ball like that from youth. being able to hold up the ball no matter how difficult the pass is should be drilled into the players. its just a style of football i prefer. i am not saying i am correct or it is absolute, it's just what i like.

null,false,roadrunner-thrice,null,null,null,"Seems like points dropped, especially after the red, but I think the performance was encouraging for the most part.

Mane has really come into his own, and looks like a danger whenever he's on the ball. I haven't seen a defender that's been able to handle him in the last few games. Some good link ups with Clyne as well, who was also lively.

Today, comapred to against QPR, we were actually able to play the killer ball in the final third to set up chances (especially JWP!). The problem today was that we just couldn't finish the chances. I think some of this has to fall on Pelle, who doesn't seem to have any confidence in his goalscoring ability at this point, and Tadic, who wanted to be too intricate instead of just shooting.

It also has to be said that West Ham were excellent defensively, especially considering they were playing with 10 men for the last 25 minutes and basically 9 men for the last 15. Cresswell and Kouyate were both immense in the last 25 minutes. In fact, Kouyate was a monster all game.

So the result might seem frustrating now, but I think that's indicative of just how well we're playing, even with a good number of our key players injured - the game was always ours to win from the start. And at the end of the day, a point was enough to keep us in 3rd, so its not a total loss.

It tells you something when a center back is pushed up as an additional striker for the last 10mins and gets the chance to whip a great shot from outside the box.... more of that should have been happening.

Ill take the positives however:

1 - No additional injuries, we know what can happen when playing WHU/Stoke etc..
2 - Harry Reed fits the first team nicely.
3 - Djuricic looks attack minded and intelligent with the ball (although a little shot shy)
4 - 4 points from 9 in this goal drought spell still sees us in 4th place.

Occasionally there are 'failed auctions' but this is very rare and usually only occurs when a country is perceived to be in trouble. If for example Greece went to the markets now the auction would almost certainly fail. Russia has backed out of over 10 auctions this year for fear of one failing.

null,false,calculusprime,null,null,null,"&gt; To complain about someone with 5 kids getting 26k+ a year because they can't work is to complain about the whole British welfare system in general. 

This is the point. The British welfare system in broken with over-generosity and easy loopholes. However it is Sinn Fein, themselves alone, who are opposed to the ""Fit for Work"" test. They would apparently rather people who *can* work continue getting payments not to work. Its fair to criticise them on this.

&gt; Northern Ireland statistically is one of the poorest parts of the U.K. and West Belfast is arguably the poorest constituency. Don't jump to conclusions before you look at hard demographics. 

Small fact check. Child Poverty Action Group and ONS stats continually show Manchester and Glasgow constituencies to be quite a bit worse, as well as some London constituencies such as Peckham. Turns out residents of West Belfast are at least the 3rd most oppressed people in the world, if not the 4th.

&gt; Also reading your comments you've turned it into an almost sectarian slant remember that the Shankill area is also a part of West Belfast and I'm sure that it adds to the number on the list.

I have little doubt about that. I don't absolve many in the Flegger community of milking the benefits system too. There is a small difference though in that the Fleggers are not accusing the UK taxpayers of mass oppression however. This was the point I was making - about the odour of hypocrisy from Sinn Fein when they plead for the UK welfare state to remain ever-generous to them.

The correct answer would have been to start off by explaining what a positive test means (10% of the drink drive limit) and that a positive test does not mean that the driver was drunk in any way that we would normally understand.  He should've gone on to explain that: ""this test is a good and sensitive test, but is, perhaps too sensitive for its own good and because of this sometimes registers false positives.  In this case the man is diabetic and when his insulin dose is due, his body chemistry could trigger a false reading.  In this instance, we believe this was the case and we believe the man was dismissed unfairly"".

Of course, today this is likely to be completely untrue because more modern breathalysers are more specific, but that would hopefully have been a follow up question and the RMT guy would just deny it and cite ""very few reported cases where this has happened"".

why not? in broad principle if the product is education should a school not try and acquire the best value for the customer? if a school can deliver the same results and performance but at less cost, should that not take the consumers choice? should schools not be in competition with other schools as they would a shop and trying to deliver the best value and service for the customer?

&gt;So do you believe there is a philosophical inconsistency somewhere within the PSS document? If so where?

well ultimately yes i do see a huge inconsistency, give me one area or principle by which a co-op provides a better solution that isn't also applicable to government.

for example If you are claiming there is no need/value for a hierarchy to have oversight and vision in a business and instead each individual issue can be determined by a co-op vote  influencing direction, then how is this not applicable to government in exactly the same way.

whatever justification you find for not allowing ""the people"" to determine every issue or direction in government is equally applicable to business.

in many ways running a business is very much like running a country its the same principles and performance balancing, if you are one hand claiming a co-op system is better for business, and is at least as good or even superior to standard business then it stands to reason the same is true of government?

its like if we were comparing communism and capitalism and you claiming the retail industry should be run like communism but when it comes to the government affairs we should instead run like capitalism because capitalism is more efficient/reliable/suitable.

how can you have a broad split system, if co-op is as capable and even superior system to run a business it stands to reason it should be equally as capable and superior to run the affairs of the country?

co-ops breed inefficiency, and inefficiency is effectively wasteful, provided governments responsibly legislate and monitor private enterprise to play within the rules, non co-operatives are a better leaner and more efficient way of business.

We have no momentum going forwards, and there's a lack of creativity playing against a team in formation. Those two combined are not a recipe for goals.

Shelvey and Gomis try to link up, but the inconsistency in quality from both parties really hurts us. So many times we lose possession from bad passes and lack of movement, often letting the receiver of the pass with no choice but to take a risk or play backwards. 

Neither Dyer nor Barrow did any kind of overlapping with Naughton which could lead to good crossing possibilities, and maybe, just maybe leading to something Gomis can produce a goal from. 

It's easy to see the ghost of Bony when we gain possession in our own half and kicking it long to Gomis. He is not capable of doing anything worthwhile alone, and the rest of the team lags to far behind. Whereas Bony could just stand his ground for seemingly infinite amount of time, Gomis is reliant on having someone to play off quickly. 

As it is now the team looks frustrated, Monk looks frustrated, I am frustrated and I bet many share this sentiment around here. 

Ending on a positive note, I think the quality of a very solid partnership between Ki and Cork will be an important asset going forwards. Gylfi is coming back, our main goal threat, which will make it easier for the strikers to gain space in attack as well. Hopefully this bad spell ends soon.

Also, with no driver, there is no reason why a taxi journey should cost much more per mile than your own car, so would most people even bother having a car? Only the rich, who want a better car.

&gt; The new government, however, passed a law allowing some expressions of nudity, including child porn, and when Diamond and his group compared rates of child sexual abuse both before and after the communist regime was in power, they found that there were fewer cases of abuse after pornography became more accessible.

&gt; The data support previous work that found similar trends when pornography laws were relaxed in Japan and Denmark. Coupled with the fact that rates of other crimes did not change in the same time period in the Czech Republic, **Diamond speculates that the reason for the decline in child sexual abuse could be due to the fact that potential offenders were able to substitute child pornography for sexual acts themselves.**

It's a pretty simple concept. You give drug addicts free drugs and they don't go out and rob people for their fix. You give paedophiles access to child porn and they don't go out molesting kids.

But good luck arguing **for** child porn. People would rather other children suffer than try to solve this problem because taking any side on this other than a blanket ban on all child porn is just asking to shouted down by emotional people, regardless of their scientific background or knowledge of the subject.",null,0,null,1423696264,null,0,false,0,coinip0,null,t3_2vebms,null,t1_coinip0,null,t1_cogx6q3,null,null,null,1424539131,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Hendo and Gerrard did a good job of pressing the spurs midfield into making lots of errors. Gerrard was better than he has been recently, but definitely not outstanding. They both probably deserved 6/7's.

Moreno probably deserved a 6. He didn't do anything wrong, but we targeted their left hand side and our right. We clearly targeted Danny Rose, so Moreno was barely called upon to drive forward. Instead Ibe was our most used outlet, with him and Markovic running Rose torrid. 

Can was great, but he was also to keen out of the back occasionally and you could argue if he hadn't come out too early, their first goal was avoidable as the defense was pushed over to Can's side to cover the space he left, exposing Sakho. I'd say he deserved a 7.

Phil was by far our worst player. I've watched the game again, and he was clearly either knackered from all his recent playing time or playing on a knock. He was running tiredly all game and never got into his lively self. I'm not bashing him, he just looked bushed. He should probably be rested for Lallana this weekend to give some time to recharge.

In my opinion, when you see such vacancies (non-generic grad scheme type), you should make applications as personalised as possible, with a carefully tailored cover letter etc. Maybe sending 'dozens of cvs everyday' is not the way to go. After all, you are after just one job, not all of them. My cover letters are usually a page long, written with thorough consideration for info on the vacancy, the job profile, and the company values. For example, when I write it, I point out which aspect of the company specifically attracts me (i.e. not 'I love your values!', but 'I particularly identify with A because....). My CV is one page (but very efficient use of space through using a table with transparent borders),  and I got positive feedback from a recruiter on both.

Among companies that are quite big on data, I can name Scottish Water, Tesco Bank, Diageo, and Skyscanner. I believe only Skyscanner is still recruiting for this year's graduate intake for [Business Intelligence](http://www.skyscanner.net/jobs/vacancy/business-intelligence-analyst-internship-programme) and [Commercial and Marketing](http://www.skyscanner.net/jobs/vacancy/commercial-marketing-graduate-programme-0). [FNZ](http://www.fnz.com/careers/graduates/) is also an interesting one to try a speculative application for.

For more entry-level ""it's better than nothing"" vacancies, it's worth keeping an eye on [Adopt An Intern](http://www.adoptanintern.org.uk/current_opportunities_page) website. There are some very good vacancies there once in a while. I have had a pleasant experience applying through them so far.

I've also found a vacancy with MediaCom at my uni career website. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to show up on their website and you can only apply directly through the uni career service, but [here](http://pastebin.com/DDHSVQVG) is the ad. Feel free to write a speculative application through their [contact details](http://www.mediacomedinburgh.com/en/contact-us/edinburgh/edinburgh/edinburgh/edinburgh.aspx), or look somebody up on LinkedIn and get in touch there.

[Amey Graduate Scheme](http://gs19.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_amey01.asp?newms=jj&amp;id=108528&amp;) is still open for applications.

[Kames Capital](http://www.kamescapital.com/careers.aspx) have ongoing recruitment (you could possibly have a go at applying to Operations).

I believe [Selex](http://www.selex-es.com/careers) are still hiring as well.

There are also currently some PT Research Assistant vacancies at Edinburgh University (The 
'Research Assistant (UNICEF) 24.5h' one seems intriguing). Search [here](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/). Same for [Edinburgh Napier](http://www.napier.ac.uk/vacancies/Pages/Vacancies.aspx).

I don't know your specific background in statistics, but if you want to make yourself more employable as a statistician, while you wait for the graduate schemes and other vacancies to open up, practice working with statistical and business intelligence software, especially R (among others: SPSS, STATA, SAS, Matlab). Knowledge of databases (SQL) and advanced Excel skills (pivot tables, some VBA) are also beneficial.


If you are enthusiastic enough, you may contact some of your potential employers, ask about a problematic area or challenge they are currently facing that your skills could help resolve, and work together with them on an independent research project. Imagine you are doing another dissertation, and they are your supervisor. They give you the topic, and you work on your own, occasionally contacting them for information. Then, once grad schemes open up, you will have contacts, you will have background research on the challenges facing the company, and you will have a relevant demonstrable piece of work.

So he's 22MPH above the speed limit .Either way he was exceeding the speed limit, quite considerably, on a congested fast road whilst undertaking around fast moving traffic, who wouldn't expect him to do that. Endangerment doesn't come into it with careless driving. You can be considered to be driving without due care and attention on an empty road.   Put it this way, if you did that on your test you'd fail for that. As someone who has passed his test, he ought to have known better. 

He could have accepted 3 points and a £100 at the roadside but decided to contest it in court, as is his right, unfortunately for him the court didn't see the funny side and decided to take a hard line with him, as they are entitled to do. 

As to RJs videos. He does pull some sketchy manoeuvres (so far as the law goes) and there probably are a few things which would get him some tickets but nothing as major as that. However most of his filtering is initially very different simply because of the speed involved and the fact that traffic is largely stationary or slow moving. The other factor is, he is paying attention and slowing down to a safe speed when needed, then making progress when he can see its safer to do so. The guideline given on bikesafe is simply this, you shoudn't be filtering at more than 20/25mph for safety reasons. You shouldn't be doing that much more than surrounding traffic either. If its stationary and you're doing 15mph you're making a lot of extra progress. By the same token if its moving at 25mph and you're filtering at 30 you're making 1/6th extra progress and it could be dangerous as the situation is much more dynamic.

Mortgage brokers are good but it's possible to do it yourself - just spend a day going to all the high street banks and building societies and seeing each one for a quote. But it can be intimidating if you're a bit shit with money, but you need to learn it so you're not blind. I really liked money saving expert website for simple advice. Just google mortgage advice and that website. 

When you apply for a mortgage make sure all your shit is in order. You will be asked to prove how you got your deposit.  If your mate lent to five grand then he will need to write a letter sayimg it was a gift or you'll have to include it in your outgoings. Obviously you will pay him back, don't fuck your friend over.  But you will need to account for all of your savings towards yhe house.

 Don't overstretch on your mortgage,  you will need abput ten payments in reserve savings or the bank will get twitchy. When uou get offered one look at the bottom line repayment amount - how much will it cost me? Think about changing the length of time,  increasing the deposit amount, look at all the options. Don't be rushed by a broker (indépendant or in the bank) until you are happy and fully understand - you are paying it not them. 


Don't change your circumstances while the sale and mortgage is going through. Do look at houses that need a bit of work, go for a smaller house in a nicer area instead of a big house in a shit hole.  Think about any life changes in the mext five years like kids or elderly relatives eho might join the party.

null,false,ir_h,flair8,,null,"I'm making the comments about changes before the game because what you are suggesting makes no sense otherwise. 

Your main suggestion (at some point during the game - I assume at 2-2) is to move Dembele to CM, shift Eriksen to CAM and bring on a LW in place of Mason or Bentaleb (otherwise we're playing with 3 central midfielders). Chadli is obviously not 100% and it's not Townsend's natural position anyway - this might leave us in a worse position. 

Your other suggestion was to shift Rose up and put on Davies. Who do you take out then? Dembele? We would lose even more of a presence in midfield if that's the case - extremely risky and we haven't seen them two play together often enough to even think it's a good idea.  

Last suggestion is to move the backline even further back, and then what? Liverpool are too talented going forward to allow them to keep possession and play so close to our box. 

He had 1 proper midfielder on the bench and needed freshen it up - bringing on Paulinho makes sense. On his day he can offer something going forward but unlucky for us he was shit yesterday. Remember, it was less than a month ago that he was voted man of the match against Burnley where he scored 1 and had 2 assists. 

You're saying Pochettino ""let the team down,"" with a ""baffling gameplan"" and that ""everyone"" can see except for him that Eriksen can't play on the left - problem is, most of your suggestions are honestly not more viable alternatives.

15% under is definitely quite low, and you risk not being taken seriously. It obviously depends on a place, but I think generally you should start with around 5-7%. Again, there are no strict rules and these figures are for the South East. It also helps if you could justify your lower offer. For example, if the windows need replacing, mention that as a reasoning for the lower offer. Basically, don't just name an unrealistically low figure without putting some thought into it. Some houses are actually worth the asking price, if there are people willing to pay.

In our case, the broker was definitely worth it. He did save us a lot of time and stress that would've otherwise been spent on running around the high street banks to find the best deal. Did all the paperwork for us and overall saved us a lot of hassle.

It makes no difference to Royal Mail if you pay the redirection. Their existence isn't dependant on redirections. Don't pay it and mail goes to your old address regardless. Don't pay it and tell absolutely everyone you're new address and mail then goes there. They're still getting money.

Royal Mail will catch up in terms of what? Being a huge financial burden on the state and the taxpayer? It was successful and making a profit under state ownership and continues to do so with with revenues increasing. Much unlike USPS which has been losing money for years.

Yes I would invest in Royal Mail right now. Revenues are increasing, costs are falling, it is more respected than a lot of its competitors, online shopping and therefore parcels continue to rise, it has a good dividend yield, it has billions of pounds worth of buildings and land that could be sold and it has plenty of scope to increase its profit margins. Most traders have it as hold or buy.

Balotelli gives us a great option for a two-striker system. 

I can't see us splashing the cash on any ""top striker"". Ings is definitely not one, he's a good prospect who is currently in great form. He's not going to score in every game for the rest of his career, so don't hype him up so much. We really need to get a replacement for Lucas, since he's the only real DM we have. Can is great to be cover, but his versitility is hiding the fact that he would much rather be a box-to-box central midfielder like Hendo was last season.

Stevie will be gone this summer. That frees up one place in the first team.

null,false,spiz,null,null,null,"I did listen to it. The RMT guy handled it awkwardly from the outset. Ferrari does what a lot of interviewers do - the key for the interviewee is to not get flustered by the aggressive phrasing and 'answer between the lines'.

What Ferrari is actually asking is 'How do you justify your position?', but is phrasing it in the way most people are thinking. Difficult as it might be, the interviewee should be grateful for this because it allows him to directly address what the listeners are thinking. Remember that they're often are still getting up to date on the story so they want to hear 'the argument for the defence'. 

You're right in saying he touched on the points I mentioned, but I meant that pretty much what he should have said verbatim. The problem was that he touched on the important stuff and then lost it completely.  

He also raised another issue in a hurry which he doesn't reassure me about: if this guy was hyperketotic that would mean he was in a state of starvation. In a diabetes patient that likely means he is due his insulin.  If the story is that he's he got enough of a ketosis to fail a breathalyser, how is his glycaemic control usually?  You can drive HGVs and trains with diabetes, but your control shouldn't be erratic (in a case like this, glucose would be likely to be high, but you need to report hypos at the wheel and can't have had one for 12 months to drive an HGV - I don't know the rules for trains). Focusing on this and saying that the guy is very careful with his diabetic control because he is generally conscientious and cares about the safety of his passengers would be a nice character reference. Instead I'm left feeling uneasy. 

As the interviewee you basically answer a slightly different question to the one asked and if interrupted, you either ignore the interruption or point out that you're trying to finish a point.  Your job is to look like the rational and mature guy, especially if you're trying to push a point that's unlikely to be true (still a fallacy but it looks a damn sight better).

Now, I'm assuming that Allen, Johnson and Enrique have no place in the first team. With that in mind, I'm certain that we need a new DM, a new RCB (since Kolo won't be around forever, and bless him, we could do with someone to challenge Skrtel), a new RB, regardless of whether Manquillo stays for another season, a new GK to challenge Migs and a new AMC.

The last one surprised me, but without Gerrard we're going to be short an attacking midfielder. Ideally we would like someone creative like Coutinho, who can comfortably cover on the left. Ideally they'd be a competent wing back as well, since at the moment I'm not sure who our cover for Moreno would be if he gets injured. I guess Ibe and Enrique? Edit: that's not so vital. Depending on whether or not Lovren comes good, a new LCB might be necessary, but I expect he'll be given next season as second choice at the very least. The point is, we have the makings of a cracking team, especially for the 4-4-2 which we used so effectively last year, and this year against Spurs. We just need that new DM and to hope that we can get two strikers fit and in form.

So, I basically gave my two weeks (actually three) notice to leave the job and that's it.
It turns out the service charge used to be shared among the staff and then they stopped doing this, because some of the workers were paying too much in taxes (???).

As for the situation now :
some of the workers (the ones that have been there for more than a couple of years) they get the service charge. Of all front of the house staff I think a couple of guys only are getting it.
If a guy that has been working there for more than a year and does its job diligently doesn't get it, why should i get it? I just started, I try to do my best, but I'm no waiter whatsoever.
He also said that if he had to share the service charge among all staff, he would go broke.
That's actually when I said ""thanks for everything, here's my two weeks notice"".

So, since there's no chance of living in London for 6.75 quids, I'd rather be out of the city in a few weeks than stay here and work my ass off to end up having just enough money for cigarettes and other small stuff.

Thought that for once in my life I could actually enjoy working for someone else. Once again, I proved myself wrong. 
I'd rather be dealing drugs (doesn't mean that I will, LOL) than work for 40 quids a day.

Well,you don't know till you try.

What I'll be doing now?
I'm applying for a startup loan. There's a very little chance that I could get one (just moved to the uk less than 3 months ago), but I guess it's worth a try.

So now I have very little time and fuckall money to sort out how to live in such an expensive city. 
before I get the loan, I think I'll try to start repairing iPhones.
I have no clue how to do it.
Got an iPhone 4 a couple of months ago. If i spend some of the monies I got left on inventory, tools and a couple of broken iphones (that can be sold afterwards!) I could make it.

Let's see how it goes.
Thanks again :D
Sorry for all the fuss.

I'd love to hear more from people working and living on minimum wage in london. I may end up writing a book about it, lol
It's weird to be working 35+/wk and not being able to buy toilet paper.

As i said. Multiple options.

Move Dembele back into CM instead of Mason. Seemed logical enough that it would be instead of him since Paulinho came on for Mason. Both can play at LW and both offer more protection than Eriksen. Chadli came on later, so he seemed fit enough to be subbed in.

No one is saying that we should have taken Dembele off. Davies could have come on for Rose or Mason. Rose had a shocker, so adjustments had to be made. The commentators even pointed it out and said that it would end bad, and it did indeed.

You say ""move the backline even further back"". Like we had already moved it back? We played with a high line and constantly had to turn our backs and run with Sturridge. It's probably the reason why Pochettino prefers Dier over Fazio right now. Because Dier is really fast for a CB and Fazio is not. Have you also watched Liverpool recently? Because they struggle against a deeper backline and defensive teams. They absolutely love when they can counter attack with speed.

We didn't need what Paulinho could offer. We needed to strengthen our midfield defensively and 2-2 would have been a really good result for us. Paulinho is a bottler and has no presence in midfield. He isn't good on the ball and he is one of our worst players defensively with or without the ball. Did you see him try to tackle? His first 50/50 and he bottled it.

One can't be surprised that the Paulinho sub didn't work out(it even made us worse), if they had seen the game up until that point. It's the same with the Rose penalty. When a player looks like an accident bound to happen, then you can't be surprised when it happens.

But the main thing is Pochettino did absolutely nothing to prevent our left side getting attacked all the game. No one thought Paulinho would somehow be able to stop Liverpool killing us down our left side.

null,false,196884,null,null,null,"Our formation is 3-2-4-1. The ""2"" are really wingbacks, and have the jobs of providing width during attack *and* covering the wide areas during defense -- this will be important later. The ""4"" is a square, with 2 defensively minded players feeding the forward 2 (effectively 2 #10s) who plays behind the lone striker. The lack of true wingers means that our team is formation is narrow.

Why we are so effective : we need 3 things to make our team work. 

(1) the back 2 of the square midfield must link up well with the front 2 both by feeding them (just count the number of times Lucas pass to coutinho each game), and covering the area in front of the 3 CB. 

(2) the front 2  of the square midfield must cover a lot of ground behind the lone striker -- both wide areas and the usual ""#10"" areas. In effect, our 2 #10s play the roles of the usual #10 + 2 wingers. 

(3) The wingbacks provide both width during defense and attack. This means that these guys need to run run run run and run some more. Notice that our team works best when we have fast runners in wingback roles -- Moreno, Ibe, Markovic, while people like Glen Johnson and Enrique are more defensive, so do not provide width during attack.


Ok, where are our weaknesses? We have two :

(a) Lack of width -- we are very vulnerable during transition from attack to defense. This is when our wingbacks are caught further up, and our 3 CB are narrow in the middle. A fast team can run into oceans of space during this phase.  This is why Fat Sam played Downing on the wing instead of his usual # 10 role -- despite Tony ""it's just a tiny pull"" Gale complaining all game, Fat Sam knows that Downing running into 3 CB is a dead end. Unfortunately for him, our young team is too energetic for him. But he got the right idea : overload the wide areas during attack. 

(2) The 3 CB. Due to the fact that we are a ""3 back"" team, the lack of natural fullbacks mean that our defensive line is actually further back than usual (basically 4 can cover a bigger ""base"" -- think of a cone emanating from the goal, and 4 can cover a bigger base of the cone). This means that there is *a lot more space* between the CB line and our midfield. In other words, the opposition #10 has more space to play in -- now they still have to run through the 3CB so a ""pace/dribble #10"" is not going to be effective. but put a creative #10 there, like Hazard or a Cesc, then we can end up being punished. This is why Lucas is so pivotal in our shape -- Lucas has superb positional sense *and* he knows when to draw the tactical foul when the CB line and the mid field line is too far apart. 

Finally, how to defend against us? As many said, the low-block aka park-the-bus works. Why? because our shape does not lend to using the wide areas as crossing base, so always cut-inside. Preventing us fro playing in the central areas will stop us (see Bolton, Chelsea). Sure we still score, but we need moments of brilliance to do so.

TL; DR : to punish us, overload the wide areas, use the space between CB and Midfield (#10 area), and park-the-bus to defend.

null,false,Catses,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"In terms of child welfare, which is the main issue here, cases like this the local authority has a statutory duty to safeguard the welfare of children as a paramount concern. It's very likely social work involvement will follow at some point in the future, but it would be better at this stage if the mother was to phone the duty social work department and advise she is having difficulty safeguarding her daughters welfare. If she doesn't, then its likely that someone else will at some point - most likely the school or other involved professionals.

Regarding the housing situation, the mother can present as homeless but as you say an intentionality decision is possible unless there are mitigating circumstances that can be shown. I'm not so sure on the English legal situation but in Scotland at least its likely they would be offered temp accommodation which could possibly be extended beyond the initial offer even if no legal homelessness housing duty was owed. I'm sure you could argue it's not reasonable for the mother and daughter to continue living in the family home if it has resulted in statutory overcrowding.

The mother needs to start taking action - perhaps contact Shelter for housing advice and assistance with a homelessness application.

It's sounds like the mother in this case likely has a lot of issues of her own which she needs support in working through, from what you've said it sounds like her lifestyle is very chaotic and lacking in any structure at all, even to the extent of lacking basic personal hygiene. I'd think this is probably symptomatic of some underlying mental health issue. Fair enough if you think she wilfully ignored letters and such and has not done herself any favours, but learned helplessness in particular is a very common thing. if the family unit is ever to function at an acceptable level to safeguard the daughters welfare then that is likely only going to succeed if it goes hand in hand with some kind of family resource worker or other long term social work involvement.

If we were to view the world through your eyes, the rape of those girls wasn't caused by a separatist attitude on the part of the perpetrators - they were innocent; they were driven to racially-motivated sexual abuse by white people.

Very rarely is Gomis trusted to deal with anything more than a header or a quick pass back. At times Shelvey, Dyer and Montero would see Gomis and seem to actively decide not to pass it to him. Additionally, against Sunderland we all saw Dyer's frustration with Gomis.

I get that Gomis WAS a Champions League striker and we did promised him playing time, but at this point he is looking like Altidore did at Sunderland. He hasn't just been bad, he has been horrendous. Every game. He contests no crosses in the box and if one accidentally finds its way to his head it seems he makes sure to head it far faaaaar from the net. He literally jogs between the half line and the edge of the 18 over and over again all game long. Then when he's trusted with a pass, OF COURSE he attempts to round the defender with a backheel. HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT GOMIS? HAS THAT TRICK EVER WORKED? Oh and then once a game he'll hit a chance almost well enough to give us hope, only for it to go wide.

This is all gibberish though, let's look at numbers. According to [WhoScored](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/14308/) Gomis averages 12 passes a game. Bony averaged 25 a game for us. More importantly though this stat blew my fucking mind. Gomis averages 0.4 Shots on target a game. What. the. fuck. Zero. Point. FOUR. That is less than a shot on target every two games. 

Now it is obvious Gomis is not Bony, but let's compare him to Oliveira. Gomis' sole goal against Arsenal gives him a resounding lead over Oliveira's 0. Outside of that Oliveira and Gomis are quite similar in terms of shots , shots on target etc. 

However we cannot forget that OLIVEIRA IS NOT AN ATTACKING MID. It is absurd. Anyone who has ever watched him is blown away that we'd play him there. He is getting limited minutes at a position he has never played and yet he consistently looks more dangerous than Gomis. Nelson has not yet played striker for us. It is absolutely mental to me. We have Jonjo and Siggy. Is Oliveira supposed to just sit on the bench now for the rest of the season while Gomis the uncoordinated Giraffe Na'avi flounders around trying to figure out how to play football? 

I'm just so done with this Gomis saga. Cross after cross is launched into the box while Gomis sits at the top of the 18 wondering why no one trusts him with a long shot. I'd rather play a 4-3-3 with Siggy as a false nine than watch Bafe play again.

You broke my heart Bafe. You broke my fucking heart. You were supposed to be somebody? What happened? I believed in you..

I feel better now.

I see that you managed to misunderstand my question. There's a surprise. I'm not entirely sure why being white comes into it, or guilt. Also the Jay report that I believe you are referring to was gender neutral (that was 1,400 boys and girls - with a large chunk being boys). But that's not particularly important.

Oh, now it is rape. Again, that wasn't what the report said. The definition of ""child sexual abuse"" used was a lot broader than rape, and could cover things that were legal (although that doesn't make them right). I also didn't say anything about the perpetrators of any crimes being innocent - you've read that into what I wrote. Nor the stuff about white people. The Jay report also wasn't that conclusive as to whether there was racial motivation behind the events in Rotherham. Of the very limited data on the matter, it seems that some of these sorts of things were but others weren't.

Also, if we're generalising, wouldn't it be better to go with the majority of Muslims, rather than minority; the law-abiding ones who aren't blowing people up, cutting peoples' heads off, or committing sexual abuse?",null,0,null,1423712127,null,0,false,0,coiw0h1,null,t3_2vkthr,null,t1_coiw0h1,null,t1_coiv443,null,null,null,1424543146,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

But the team's cohesiveness, football intelligence and depth of goal threat from all areas of the squad just made them look a league winning machine. When Rick Parry and David Moores signed Rafael Benitez in 2004 I really thought he was going to make Liverpool in Valencia's image, but it only materialized briefly, if ever, in the 2008/09 season.
