Actually, there is an explanation.  ""007"" and ""James Bond"" are identifiers for a special position in the British Secret Service and not the name of the person serving in that job.  Several different people have held that position over time, just as many have held the positions for ""Q"" and ""M"".  This would also account for the fact that despite introducing himself to villains on several occasions, and often in public settings, no one ever seems to recognize him.

Now... I suppose it is conceivable that every incarnation of James Bond has in fact been the same Time Lord masquerading as different people.  Given his penchant for violence, I would say that this ""007"" may be a sort of past time for ""The Master"" while he is cooking up her next evil plot to destroy the universe.

* Shares as you earn. I can't remember the percentage of shares to wage i was getting but working part time earned me Â£300 in Tesco shares a year which matured for tax free sale after 3 years. (had to work for 12 months in the company)

* Reduced price shares that you can purchase ontop of your free shares. Didn't take advantage of this but my deputy manager would drop his Christmas bonus each year into them whilst selling 5 year old shares for a matured profit. Worked well for him.

* Store performance based bonus each quarter. We received around 20% uncapped bonus money of that month's wage (including overtime) each quarter if store performance was in line with targets.

* Monthly vouchers for Tesco related stuff in wage slips. Usually garbage like 10% off of virgin holidays or what ever but sometimes you'd get some decent usable money off stuff.

null,false,buried_treasure,null,null,null,"The UK political system is -- as you'd expect -- a parliamentary system. It's a little bit unusual in that much of the way it works is governed by unwritten rules and conventions -- we do not have a single written constitution to which someone can point and say ""these are the rules"".

Just like in Australia, the Queen is Head of State. On paper she has quite a lot of power but in practice if she were to ever do something against the wishes of Parliament she'd suddenly find herself unemployed. 

Beyond that, there are two houses of parliament. The upper house, the House of Lords, is something of an oddity -- it consists entirely of people who *haven't* been elected. The actual makeup of the Lords is that it's composed of 92 hereditary peers (these are people who gained an aristocratic title through right of birth), a couple of dozen bishops (yes just like Iran we allow religious leaders to make our laws) and the rest of it (about 600-700 others) is made up of life peers -- people granted an aristocratic title by this or a previous government, but which they can't hand on to their descendants.

Although it sounds crazy, the Lords mostly functions quite well as an upper house. There is an argument to be made that because they're not elected, and therefore not seeking re-election, they are less likely to be swayed by populism or pressure groups and more likely to vote according to what's actually best for the country.

The lower house is the House of Commons, representatives there are called MPs (Members of Parliament). There are 650 MPs, each represents a specific part of the country, and they are all voted for once every 5 years. The UK uses a first-past-the-post electoral system for parliament, and there is no proportional representation or top-up. This means that in general one party tends to get an absolute majority in the Commons; although at the moment we do have a coalition government this is quite a  rare situation for the UK.

After a general election, whichever party gets an absolute majority (or is able to put together a working coalition) gets to choose a Prime Minister (actually the Queen appoints the PM, in one of the odd fictions mentioned in the first paragraph).  For the last hundred years or so the PM has always been the leader of the winning party, and always a member of the Commons.

The PM is Head of Government and effectively the person that runs the country, along with his/her team of senior ministers known as the Cabinet.

-----

Beyond Parliament there is a whole swathe of other tiers of government. Scotland has its own Parliament which is growing ever more powerful; Wales and Northern Ireland have Assemblies which aren't quite full-blown Parliaments (in terms of their power) but not far off. England has no Parliament of its own.

Below that level it gets really complicated, and local government takes place at either county, city, borough, or parish level, depending on where in the UK you live.

Older males with lots of power flirting with young women just gives me the squicks -- too strong a reminder of how that plays in real society, where I find it deeply problematic.

So go or stay, Clara is there for the time being to play out the crafting of a different sort of companion-relationship, of a type that our hyper-sexualized culture can barely conceive of, especially in this weird period of grown women being persuaded that they must reduce themselves to as close to pre-pubescence as they can (skinny, tinkly little high voices, and as close to no body hair as possible) in order to attract men, not to mention the submission-craze supporting the success of 50 Shades of Being Told What To Do By a Ken Doll and its imitations.

So what else is there?  I'd say the creatives are aiming for a cross between battlefield comrades (people who ""have each other's back"" because that's your best chance of survival under fire) and adult siblings (all that sniping and the teasing put-downs -- how well I remember that casual meanness that's ""just a joke"" from and among my own sibs!).  

More power to 'em, I say: it's not going to be easy, given all the flirty goofiness that came before. And the fact that Peter Capaldi projects the appeal of a very classy ""silver fox"" and Clara is not an Osgood to look at doesn't make it any easier either, but will make it all the more striking if they succeed.

That's pure and simple bullshit. Along ethnic lines, ethnicities like the Fulani and Hedareb practice type II and type III FGM.  If we're talking about Somalis in terms of nationality, again, it's bullshit.  Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Guinea and Sierrra Leone all have prevalent FGM practices; often it's impossible to split these practices purely by nationality though, as it's practised differently in different parts of each country, for example:  type II being prevalent in south Nigeria and type III in the north.

&gt;which we both know to be completly false; unless we are in Solamia.

So yeah, if you want to crack down on the ""toxic"" dissemination of bullshit, I suggest you start with yourself. 

&gt;I disagree with you about gendering the mutilation of babies, but thats about all.

Trouble is, the data (including the testimonies of FGM victims) speaks for itself, and it doesn't give a fuck about your gender politics.  Downplaying the severity of FGM so you feel it's on more of a level playing field with circumcision is twisting the facts to fit your gender politics, and it's sick.

Even if they do cut on a real person, it'll be to the shape of a model in the country where it's designed and manufactured, not necessarily an Anglo/American body type. If you've ever heard someone give off about Zara's sizing, it's because their clothes are designed for short, very narrow hipped Spanish women. That's the stuff they design in house.

woah, sorry.... that just slipped out.

The thing is, those issues aren't really political, or SHOULDN'T be. 

All sides in the UK (thankfully) by in large, believe climate change is real and man made and needs to be stopped. There's just different levels of will perhaps of where that should occur. But that nuclear is safer, cleaner, and less CO2 emitting than coal isn't politics, it's fact. And that you can't run a country off of technologies that can only ever be supplementary is also fact.

All sides (by in large) agree that as a wealthy nation, we should be leading the way in ending world poverty and the blight of malnutrition. There's some disagreement as to what ratio of aid:development-assistance:technology development etc, but that GM technology is safe, proven, and ready to do all those things is fact. That GM will allow farmers/villagers in areas where nothing but rice grows to have a proper source of vitamin A, that it will help grow drought resistant crops for drought risk areas to avoid famines, that it can reduce the required land for agriculture in a booming population, are all facts. 

The military one is more political I guess. But all sides by in large agree we need to be able to defend ourselves, and that as a rich country we have the responsibility to step in to prevent atrocities (maybe this is less unanimous these days since people protested Libya which was literally a ""We step in or they all die"" moment). You can't do that without an active armed force.

All sides agree that any troops we do have should have the best weaponry and protection we can get. That we won't have cutting edge tech if we convert our arms manufacturers into windmill factories is fact.

The main parties tend to bicker about the ratio of each approach, which of two approaches to a problem will work best. I don't agree with the approach the Tories make on a lot of the issues, but I know that adopting them COULD do what the Tories want them to do, even if that is not what I want to happen. The greens argue against fact. They want to stop climate change, but want to do it by stopping our only method to do so. They want to reduce inequality, but by suddenly yanking economic levers that if not moved gently will destroy the economy. They want to pay for a national allowance, but pay for it with peanuts and good intentions.

I want those things, but I want THEM, not to talk about them whilst sat high in my lounge with my friends. ""Man, you know it's those fucking parasitic corperations man. If we just charged them like, some more tax, then probably that'd be like Â£240 billion right?"" ""Yeah man, they're all bastards!

Going by the responses on this thread, I'm guessing most of you don't know how department stores work, have never been into Selfridges and are assuming clothing sizes must be based on something universal and not completely arbitrary. 

Like another commenter up thread pointed out, instead of having Kooples men on the first floor and women on ground, all Kooples clothing will be in the same place. Which is good for Kooples customers because there's fuck all difference between their men and women's sizing other than leg length. A lot of the super hip brands have a unisex, Patti Smith ish, aesthetic at the moment. 

Selfridges do not manufacture their own clothes - they select brands that fit their aesthetic and those brands have concessions within the store. 

Unless you're getting made to measure, your clothes have been designed to fit either a cheap, possibly old, tailoring model in a factory in Bangladesh,of they're sized for the company's 'ideal customer'. That ideal customer is tall and skinny, with no bulk if a guy and no boobs if a woman. Anything bigger than a size ten or 28"" waist is just a scaled up version of the original pattern, which is why so many clothes look great in store/online but crap in person if you're not a skinny teenager. 

So, many narrow hipped women find men's jeans fit them better than women's jeans. There's a bigger taboo about men buying women's clothes, even though most of them are made for boyish body types under 6 foot tall. 

Selfridges is for fashionistas, not for Debenhams shoppers, and their female customers likely already have unisex or male items in the wardrobe and will be excited about seeing all of Acne's stuff in the one place. 

I don't and have never understood why 'Brand X male' and 'Brand X female' had to be in completely different sections of the store, especially when shopping with a friend or SO of the opposite sex.",null,0,null,1422521059,null,0,false,0,co4hbcd,null,t3_2tyf26,null,t1_co4hbcd,null,t3_2tyf26,null,null,null,1424328381,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"For one thing this is more a change to the way the police are required to look into the case, rather than a change to the law, or even to the prosecution guidelines.

With regard to this specifically, this stuff has been floating around for years.  About a decade ago there was a high profile case where a student got so drunk that a bouncer was asked to take her home.  They had sex and he was subsequently accused of rape.  His prosecution failed in court, because she at least had the decency to admit that she couldn't remember is she had consented.  After this the Home Secretary at the time (Labour) started bawling about how the law had to change to address the idea of consent that wasn't consent.

A couple of years later there's a case where a couple meet up and spend the entire afternoon and evening drinking, then go home and have sex.  There's an accusation of rape and the guy is convicted.  This is because she's not in a fit state to give (or even not give) consent.  The counter-side doesn't apply, because it's inconceivable that neither of them could give consent and you have some sort of weird mutual rape.  Subsequently the Court of Appeal overturns his conviction and in its decision the court explains that the law already has the capacity to consider the issue of the mind of the defendant, in a case where the accuser wasn't in a fit state to give consent.  That is, if you have sex and you're accused and the girl claims she was to drunk, drugged or stupid to consent, they already look at your side of it.  

One of the interesting things in that decision, however, is that the acquittal **didn't** come about because the judges rejected the argument that drunken consent isn't really consent, but because the court determined that the conviction was unsafe, because the previous judge hadn't directed the jury properly.

The bigger picture thing comes down to the fact that governments want to be popular.  ""Won't **someone** think of the children!"" is a populist line and that's what all the porn ban is pinned to.  And you might think, ""Oh come on, no one's **that** dumb!"" but they are.  I had a girlfriend who literally argued that watching porn was the same as cheating.  People still think pornography and video games cause rape and violence.

The counter-argument is weakened because in the event you argue that endlessly restricting freedoms is bad you're pretty much guaranteed to be depicted as, ""Mr. Blaze It:  Hates children!"" or, ""Mr. Blaze It:  Angry he can't watch anal fisting porn!"" or, ""Mr. Blaze It: Pro-rape.""  Even if nearly everyone recognises that that's a fallacious bag of crap, no one wants to be that guy - Most especially no one in politics.  Ed Milliband simply can't afford to end up being described as, ""Ed Milliband:  Pro-rape, pro-terrorist, pro-scat.""  So, these things go essentially unchallenged.

In terms of timing, we have an election coming up in a couple of months.  So this is the prime-time period for rolling out ill thought out, populist rubbish.  It gets you a sound-bite people will remember in the build up to the election and it's not in play long enough for people to see you either broke your promises, or that it was actually an incredibly terrible idea.",null,0,null,1422521401,null,0,false,0,co4he30,null,t3_2u0kii,null,t1_co4he30,null,t1_co42wzf,null,null,null,1424328345,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,null,"The Green party have a list of about 90 policy statements relating to crime and justice, all of which spell out in no uncertain terms that the system will be dramatically overhauled to ensure that the prison population will be dramatically reduced, community-based restorative justice favoured, etc, across the board, for all people. They also have 3 specific policies which mention women which, for some reason, everyone has gone bat-shit nuts over. Read the whole policy and take it as a whole. 

Additionally, do you think women currently receive the same sentences that men do for the same crimes? [Here is the introduction from a study by Parity UK:](http://www.parity-uk.org/Briefing/MenandWomenandtheCJSfComplete.pdf)

&gt; Statistics available for year 2010/11 indicate 1,360,451 recorded arrests in England and
Wales, 1,140,497 males and 219,954 females, a proportion of females of 16.2%. Of the total,
210,683 were juveniles, with a female proportion of 18.3%. However, most of the statistics
referred to in this Briefing Paper relate to calendar year 2011, and in some cases totals are
inconsistent with the year 2010/11 totals. Compare, for instance, the 219,954 females
recorded as arrested in 2010/11 with the much higher 297,938 females actually sentenced in
year 2011.

&gt;During year 2011, 1,246,320 persons were sentenced for all offences, 948,382 males and
297,938 females, a female proportion of 23.9%. The female proportion sentenced for
indictable offences was 14.3% and for summary offences was 27.4%, this suggesting that of
all offences committed by females, a larger proportion are in the summary category, than in
the case of males. For instance, of those appearing before magistratesâ courts for summary
offences, 27.0% were female, but only 14.4% for indictable offences.
Of those persons sentenced to immediate custody. 7.9% were female, 8.2% in respect of
indictable offences and 6.1% for summary offences. Only 4.5% of those in prison (in
February 2013) were female.

&gt; There is a perception that the criminal justice system (CJS) is more lenient, generally, to
females than to males. Not only are more males proportionally given custodial sentences,
but the average sentence given to them of 18 months is 50% higher than that for females of
12 months. And the average time actually served in prison by males of 9.5 months is
similarly higher than the 5.8 months for females [statistics based on prison discharges in
period Oct-Dec 2011]. Moreover, prison conditions are perceived to be more kind to females
than to males, not only because of fewer numbers but also that they are being held in
conditions and within regimes âthat meet their gender specific needs and which facilitate their
successful resettlementâ. [Prison Service Order 4800 âWomen Prisonersâ]

Where is the outrage that current governments have presided over a system that treats men more harshly than women? Are they scum and unfit for responsibility in government?

[Here is a part of a transcript from a debate on this exact issue on 16th October 2012. Speaking is Jenny Chapman, Labour's Shadow Minister for Justice:](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2012-10-16a.32.1)

&gt; Of course, that is true. If something positive can come out of this debate, it might be a sense that in raising issues concerning women we are not solely concerned about women offenders. What is true, however, is that we could have much more success with that group of offenders if they were dealt with slightly differently. Given that we have such a problem with reoffending, it makes perfect sense to break offenders down into groups to be dealt with and with whom we could first have some success.

&gt; The Labour Government accepted almost all of Corstonâs 43 recommendations, and a lot of good progress was made. Five years on, some of the achievements that we should be most proud of are the end to mandatory strip searching and the targeted investment in community and diversion services for women. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend Maria Eagle who, according to my right hon. Friend Mr Straw, argued ferociously for change and did not stop until she got her wayâa fine example of the effectiveness of a womenâs justice champion, a role that has, sadly, been conspicuous by its absence in the first two years of this Government.

&gt; Progress, I am disappointed to report, has stalled. I have already noted that the current Secretary of State for Justice did not find time to make women a priority in his conference speech, although, to be fair to him, he is simply following the example set by a Government who did not include a single mention of female offenders in a Bill with the size and scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. The Secretary of State has made much of his desire to be tough on crime and, even more perhaps, of his fractious relationship with community sentencing. This is not about being hard or soft, however, but about what works, and smart community interventions are the most effective way to sentence and rehabilitate the majority of women who enter the criminal justice system. Such reform is tough on crime, as it reduces it. When I asked staff and service users at the Pankhurst womenâs centre in Manchester
what needed to change, they answered that politicians needed to grow a backboneâthey were actually a lot less polite, but I think we know what they meant.

&gt; In opposition, Labour has continued our commitment to such reformâthis month my right hon. Friend Sadiq Khan announced plans to set up a womenâs justice board. Reducing the number of the women in prison, he argued, should be a priority for any Government. The Secretary of State for Justice is not known for his desire to reduce the prison population, but if our criminal justice system is to be sensible and effective and provide value for money, it may be time for the Government to think outside the gates.

So it seems Labour also support treating women differently than men, the only difference being that they haven't specifically wrote it down on a policy website for all to criticise openly.

Think of tensions and ligaments as very old tough, rigid elastic bands, and the muscle as you stretching it out so that it is longer.

It's strong in that plane, it's weak in rotation and torsion, because they're not meant to be able to do it. That's where you get your ligament/tendon injuries.

By contrast, the muscle is made of interlocking muscle cells, which can overstretch and tear and frankly are a lot less strong, because they don't need to be strong.

They also have 3 specific policies which mention women which, for some reason, everyone has gone bat-shit nuts over. Read the whole policy and take it as a whole. 

Additionally, do you think women currently receive the same sentences that men do for the same crimes? [Here is the introduction from a study by Parity UK:](http://www.parity-uk.org/Briefing/MenandWomenandtheCJSfComplete.pdf)

&gt; Statistics available for year 2010/11 indicate 1,360,451 recorded arrests in England and
Wales, 1,140,497 males and 219,954 females, a proportion of females of 16.2%. Of the total,
210,683 were juveniles, with a female proportion of 18.3%. However, most of the statistics
referred to in this Briefing Paper relate to calendar year 2011, and in some cases totals are
inconsistent with the year 2010/11 totals. Compare, for instance, the 219,954 females
recorded as arrested in 2010/11 with the much higher 297,938 females actually sentenced in
year 2011.

&gt;During year 2011, 1,246,320 persons were sentenced for all offences, 948,382 males and
297,938 females, a female proportion of 23.9%. The female proportion sentenced for
indictable offences was 14.3% and for summary offences was 27.4%, this suggesting that of
all offences committed by females, a larger proportion are in the summary category, than in
the case of males. For instance, of those appearing before magistratesâ courts for summary
offences, 27.0% were female, but only 14.4% for indictable offences.
Of those persons sentenced to immediate custody. 7.9% were female, 8.2% in respect of
indictable offences and 6.1% for summary offences. Only 4.5% of those in prison (in
February 2013) were female.

&gt; There is a perception that the criminal justice system (CJS) is more lenient, generally, to
females than to males. Not only are more males proportionally given custodial sentences,
but the average sentence given to them of 18 months is 50% higher than that for females of
12 months. And the average time actually served in prison by males of 9.5 months is
similarly higher than the 5.8 months for females [statistics based on prison discharges in
period Oct-Dec 2011]. Moreover, prison conditions are perceived to be more kind to females
than to males, not only because of fewer numbers but also that they are being held in
conditions and within regimes âthat meet their gender specific needs and which facilitate their
successful resettlementâ. [Prison Service Order 4800 âWomen Prisonersâ]

Where is the outrage that current governments have presided over a system that treats men more harshly than women? 

[Here is a part of a transcript from a debate on this exact issue on 16th October 2012. Speaking is Jenny Chapman, Labour's Shadow Minister for Justice:](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2012-10-16a.32.1)

&gt; Of course, that is true. If something positive can come out of this debate, it might be a sense that in raising issues concerning women we are not solely concerned about women offenders. What is true, however, is that we could have much more success with that group of offenders if they were dealt with slightly differently. Given that we have such a problem with reoffending, it makes perfect sense to break offenders down into groups to be dealt with and with whom we could first have some success.

&gt; The Labour Government accepted almost all of Corstonâs 43 recommendations, and a lot of good progress was made. Five years on, some of the achievements that we should be most proud of are the end to mandatory strip searching and the targeted investment in community and diversion services for women. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend Maria Eagle who, according to my right hon. Friend Mr Straw, argued ferociously for change and did not stop until she got her wayâa fine example of the effectiveness of a womenâs justice champion, a role that has, sadly, been conspicuous by its absence in the first two years of this Government.

&gt; Progress, I am disappointed to report, has stalled. I have already noted that the current Secretary of State for Justice did not find time to make women a priority in his conference speech, although, to be fair to him, he is simply following the example set by a Government who did not include a single mention of female offenders in a Bill with the size and scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. The Secretary of State has made much of his desire to be tough on crime and, even more perhaps, of his fractious relationship with community sentencing. This is not about being hard or soft, however, but about what works, and smart community interventions are the most effective way to sentence and rehabilitate the majority of women who enter the criminal justice system. Such reform is tough on crime, as it reduces it. When I asked staff and service users at the Pankhurst womenâs centre in Manchester
what needed to change, they answered that politicians needed to grow a backboneâthey were actually a lot less polite, but I think we know what they meant.

&gt; In opposition, Labour has continued our commitment to such reformâthis month my right hon. Friend Sadiq Khan announced plans to set up a womenâs justice board. Reducing the number of the women in prison, he argued, should be a priority for any Government. The Secretary of State for Justice is not known for his desire to reduce the prison population, but if our criminal justice system is to be sensible and effective and provide value for money, it may be time for the Government to think outside the gates.

They also have 3 specific policies which mention women which, for some reason, everyone has gone bat-shit nuts over. Read the whole policy and take it as a whole. 

Additionally, do you think women currently receive the same sentences that men do for the same crimes? [Here is the introduction from a study by Parity UK:](http://www.parity-uk.org/Briefing/MenandWomenandtheCJSfComplete.pdf)

&gt; Statistics available for year 2010/11 indicate 1,360,451 recorded arrests in England and
Wales, 1,140,497 males and 219,954 females, a proportion of females of 16.2%. Of the total,
210,683 were juveniles, with a female proportion of 18.3%. However, most of the statistics
referred to in this Briefing Paper relate to calendar year 2011, and in some cases totals are
inconsistent with the year 2010/11 totals. Compare, for instance, the 219,954 females
recorded as arrested in 2010/11 with the much higher 297,938 females actually sentenced in
year 2011.

&gt;During year 2011, 1,246,320 persons were sentenced for all offences, 948,382 males and
297,938 females, a female proportion of 23.9%. The female proportion sentenced for
indictable offences was 14.3% and for summary offences was 27.4%, this suggesting that of
all offences committed by females, a larger proportion are in the summary category, than in
the case of males. For instance, of those appearing before magistratesâ courts for summary
offences, 27.0% were female, but only 14.4% for indictable offences.
Of those persons sentenced to immediate custody. 7.9% were female, 8.2% in respect of
indictable offences and 6.1% for summary offences. Only 4.5% of those in prison (in
February 2013) were female.

&gt; There is a perception that the criminal justice system (CJS) is more lenient, generally, to
females than to males. Not only are more males proportionally given custodial sentences,
but the average sentence given to them of 18 months is 50% higher than that for females of
12 months. And the average time actually served in prison by males of 9.5 months is
similarly higher than the 5.8 months for females [statistics based on prison discharges in
period Oct-Dec 2011]. Moreover, prison conditions are perceived to be more kind to females
than to males, not only because of fewer numbers but also that they are being held in
conditions and within regimes âthat meet their gender specific needs and which facilitate their
successful resettlementâ. [Prison Service Order 4800 âWomen Prisonersâ]

Where is the outrage that current governments have presided over a system that treats men more harshly than women? 

[Here is a part of a transcript from a debate on this exact issue on 16th October 2012. Speaking is Jenny Chapman, Labour's Shadow Minister for Justice:](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2012-10-16a.32.1)

&gt; Of course, that is true. If something positive can come out of this debate, it might be a sense that in raising issues concerning women we are not solely concerned about women offenders. What is true, however, is that we could have much more success with that group of offenders if they were dealt with slightly differently. Given that we have such a problem with reoffending, it makes perfect sense to break offenders down into groups to be dealt with and with whom we could first have some success.

&gt; The Labour Government accepted almost all of Corstonâs 43 recommendations, and a lot of good progress was made. Five years on, some of the achievements that we should be most proud of are the end to mandatory strip searching and the targeted investment in community and diversion services for women. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend Maria Eagle who, according to my right hon. Friend Mr Straw, argued ferociously for change and did not stop until she got her wayâa fine example of the effectiveness of a womenâs justice champion, a role that has, sadly, been conspicuous by its absence in the first two years of this Government.

&gt; Progress, I am disappointed to report, has stalled. I have already noted that the current Secretary of State for Justice did not find time to make women a priority in his conference speech, although, to be fair to him, he is simply following the example set by a Government who did not include a single mention of female offenders in a Bill with the size and scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. The Secretary of State has made much of his desire to be tough on crime and, even more perhaps, of his fractious relationship with community sentencing. This is not about being hard or soft, however, but about what works, and smart community interventions are the most effective way to sentence and rehabilitate the majority of women who enter the criminal justice system. Such reform is tough on crime, as it reduces it. When I asked staff and service users at the Pankhurst womenâs centre in Manchester
what needed to change, they answered that politicians needed to grow a backboneâthey were actually a lot less polite, but I think we know what they meant.

&gt; In opposition, Labour has continued our commitment to such reformâthis month my right hon. Friend Sadiq Khan announced plans to set up a womenâs justice board. Reducing the number of the women in prison, he argued, should be a priority for any Government. The Secretary of State for Justice is not known for his desire to reduce the prison population, but if our criminal justice system is to be sensible and effective and provide value for money, it may be time for the Government to think outside the gates.

So it seems Labour also support treating women differently than men, the only difference being that they haven't specifically wrote it down on a policy website for all to criticise openly.

null,false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;Male and female clothing is designed based on tailoring models, which in turn are based on an idealised, slim body shape.

The models themselves are based on anthropometric data. They are certainly not completely idealised, at least for most high street retailers, who's goal is to make as many sales as possible, not just to people with slim waists. 

&gt;Fashion companies, apart from the high end ateliers, buy their stock from factories in Turkey and the Indian subcontinent (and other places) and those factories are likely using a standard tailor's model to pin their designs on. 

Obviously this is completely dependent on the company. Some do, some do their own in hose design and sizing work. There is no such thing as a ""standard tailors model"", as they come in different shapes and sizes and many are adjustable. 

&gt;For bigger sizes they scale up, for smaller sizes they scale down

This was exactly my point. There are two distinct body shapes that cloths are designed around, male and female, female having thinner legs and wider hips than male. This allows the manufacturer to scale up and down the design and still fit most body shapes. This would not be possible with one single unisex design, as you would need to add extra dimensions, such as waist, making scaling impossible.

&gt;Even if they do cut on a real person, it'll be to the shape of a model in the country where it's designed and manufactured, not necessarily an Anglo/American body type. 

This is not necessarily true. There is sizing data available for basically every country and region in the world, and that data varies greatly. Clothing designed to fit a Chinese or Indian person would fit the European market very poorly, as people who have ever bought clothing directly from one of these countries probably know. Even if a factory is located in India, it will use sizing data from the country or region it is making for to design the clothes. 

One of the reasons that cloths tend to fit poorly or differently in different hight street retailers is that the manufactures may have used a generalised sizing for the whole of Europe, if the clothes are being sold across Europe, which would result in a poor fit. The other reason could be that they were designed for one European country, and distributed across the whole of Europe, which again would mean a different fit for the people in those other countries.

And asking the accused to prove their innocence - even at the investigatory stage - is extremely unsettling. 

I can see how if a woman just lies there completely passive with no response - essentially unconscious - while someone has sex with her is rape. But that is already covered - the woman is unconscious and cannot consent.

If you go with the 500, you'll need to buy another new bike to make use of your full license; if you get something bigger and limit it (like the Versys, V-Strom 650, GS650 or the NC700 if you prefer Hondas) you can just take that limiter off and have a more powerful bike for very little cost.

To answer your direct question, though, I haven't encountered a CB500x, but my sister has the CB500R, which is essentially the same bike in a different skirt. She tells me the engine is fantastic; very smooth, predictable, but powerful enough for any kind of legal road riding. In other words, the engine is perfect for a learner on an A2 license, as you'd expect given that's what Honda built it for.  She also says the handling is great but that's presumably different in the X version.

Even then, no royal attraction makes it into the top ten for tourist visits in this country. As is often mentioned in these sorts of debates, Legoland Windsor gets more visitors than Windsor Castle.

And the Crown Estate belong to the monarch, not to Lizzy Windsor the private individual. Were we to abolish the monarchy we'd be perfectly entitled to take possession of those lands and keep receiving the revenue from it. It would cost us nothing - we may even make a profit if we were to reclaim the Duchy of Lancaster as well, which is currently used to fund Charles' pet projects and maintain the monarchy.

She'd still be a hugely wealthy individual, just not taxpayer-funded. I don't see an issue with that. ",null,0,null,1422530201,null,0,false,0,co4j5yq,null,t3_2tzzf9,null,t1_co4j5yq,null,t1_co4h83n,null,null,null,1424327518,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It does at least have a dual carriageway all the way to the M5, but it doesn't have a very good train line. That ends at Exeter (and isn't as good as other similar main lines).

The real problem with the ""it's rural"" argument is that it wouldn't actually take that much work or effort in many cases. Cornwall, for example, suffers from a bottleneck of 2 miles of single lane road that connects two long stretches of dual carriageway. It is only now in 2014/15 that the government is thinking about doing something about it, rather than decades ago when they dualled the other bits. Instead of doing the job properly they'd rather do tiny bits and wait years in between them.

I suspect also that great amounts of the rail and motorway lines up north pass through similarly rural areas.

Last I'd seen, when comparing job to job there was only a couple of percentage in difference. It's only when you compare average women's salaries to average men's salary that you get things like the 87p to the Â£1 statistics. And while that is a problem, it's hardly one of equal pay.

&gt;women are underrepresented in politics and business

I agree that this is an issue, however from what I've seen, it's getting better with time. Unfortunately, there's little that you can do without introducing quotas, which often have side effects of causing resentment towards women in positions of power.

&gt;I would see all of these issues as feminist issues.

The problem is that there are a lot of vocal feminists who disagree with you and are quite outspoken if you suggest that there are serious issues with societies perceptions of men and repercussions as a result.

However for as long as we stick with those 2 central midfielders, you know Mutch will be 4th choice when Sandro makes his return. If the guy wants out, I don't blame him.

Finney *speculated* on the podcast a few weeks back that Redknapp stumbled across the successful home 4-4-2 by accident, using players out of place as it does and flying in the face of the summer transfer business. It all stinks of lack of commitment to a plan. It's obviously always good to be ready to make changes on the fly as and when they're necessary, but I think the opportunity cost of certain spending decisions in that window is haunting the club now.

null,false,PROFESSOR_CORGI_BUTT,irish,Ulster Says Yeooo,null,"You're massively overestimating the importance of and amount of care put into sizing. The most important thing to a clothing manufacturer is aesthetic, not fit, unless fit is their brand identity. Marksies makes sales (not good ones) on clothes that flatter a grown woman's shape. Topshop sells clothes on fashion and cool factors. 

 When buyers go to factories to pick up designs, which actually happens way more in the cheaper end of the market than I originally thought it did, they don't bring their ideal body shape model to try them on.

&gt;They are certainly not completely idealised, at least for most high street retailers, who's goal is to make as many sales as possible, not just to people with slim waists.""

Again, you're overestimating manufacturers. Some brands, like Evans, are cut to flatter a large figure with big boobs and thick thighs. But Evans are a ""fat people clothing company"". Topshop's ideal customer is a tall, slim teenage girl with lots of pocket money, and that's the aesthetic they're sold on, as anyone with an muscular build or big thighs will tell you. The only fashion brands that sell on practical fit are sports, outdoor, big boob lingerie and upmarket women's work wear. 
&gt; There is no such thing as a ""standard tailors model"", as they come in different shapes and sizes and many are adjustable.

Many good tailor's models scale up, but a fat person's proportions are not a thin person's multiplied by125%. Also, many of the factories pumping out logo tshirts and jeans hoping a Miss Selfridge buyer will snap them up are using equipment several decades old,
 that's been shipped over when European factories shut down. Even if they did have up to date tailor's dummies, those are mostly based on out of date measurements (tailoring equipment is a small market dominated by a handful of companies, and from what I know of those brands they're unlikely to update their metrics every year).

You want clothes that fit an average sized adult? Go to M&amp;S. You want clothes that are fashionable? Shop anywhere else. 

&gt; There are two distinct body shapes that cloths are designed around, male and female, female having thinner legs and wider hips than male

I'm not disputing that, in general, there's big differences between male and female body types. There's also a big difference in body types within genders. Some women are tall with short legs and wide hips. Some guys are tall with narrow shoulders. Most clothing companies design for one, usually slim, tall and increasingly androgynous, body type. Some women will find a great fit in the men's section and vice versa. 

&gt; Clothing designed to fit a Chinese or Indian person would fit the European market very poorly, as people who have ever bought clothing directly from one of these countries probably know. Even if a factory is located in India, it will use sizing data from the country or region it is making for to design the clothes

Uniqlo makes everything in Bangladesh and ships it worldwide, but it's all built around a Japanese body type. It does well in Europe among shorter guys and less curvy women. It also sells on the back of the 'Ooh! Japanese' factor as well. 

&gt;One of the reasons that cloths tend to fit poorly or differently in different hight street retailers is that the manufactures may have used a generalised sizing for the whole of Europe,

Well, yes. So the people who don't fit the average might do better to look in the opposite gender's section. And again, you're misunderstanding how the clothing market works. Does Apple sell phones based on what the average consumer wants? No- they design on exclusivity and style (and ease of use, but that's not the main appeal). Most fashion houses sell on their perceived style and their cool factor within their target market. Sizing doesn't come into it, unless comfort and fit are the brand usp.

I personally would prefer pushing people to change their attitudes as opposed to imposing change from above. The need to change attitudes applies to both genders women are less likely but themselves forward for promotion than men and meanwhile male dominance at the top likely leads to male applications for top jobs being more likely to be successful. As for your final point yes and I would disagree with those people strongly. However as I commented elsewhere in this thread I feel bailing on the movement isn't a constructive way to deal with it.

Women offenders are far more likely to be the primary care givers. Recognition of that reality and the disproportionate impact on women isn't to say that traditional gender roles are necessarily good. The childcare complications also adds to the expense. Literally hundreds of thousands will be spent annually on a child with specialist needs, for example. Our government is spending something like Â£200,000 annually for each child in a secure children's home. 

Besides, there are a whole bunch of other issues. This is why many legal professionals and politicians want women's prisons abolished pretty much entirely (minus violent offenders).

In general this idea that everyone should be treated identically is dangerously flawed. Equality does not always elicit true fairness. That's my view anyway. Obviously a fairly controversial stance.

My sex education, back in 2000, consisted of a boy/girl divide where the boys learnt how to put condoms on an upturned table leg and saw some pictures of diseased male anatomy, and the girls had a biology lesson on menstruation. As a gay guy, any information relevant to me was completely glossed over (as was the law at the time, unfortunately) and thus I made a lot of stupid mistakes when I left school as I had absolutely no idea I was making them, or where to go for help. I taught myself sex ed through the internet, which believe me back in 2001-ish was hard. I was pretty shocked to see that not much has changed since then when a young student recently told me he'd had the same thing a couple of years ago.

I've always thought a system like in the Netherlands would be fantastic for the UK. There, they learn about sex ed through their entire school education - starting at a young age with discussion on relationships and family, and working towards actual sex as teenagers.

Sex education in this country lacks realism, in my opinion. What little you learn in school doesn't really match reality. Where is the LGBT stuff? Where is the discussion and debate on media representations of sex, including pornography? Where is the in-depth info on diseases? Where is the acknowledgement that teenagers can and do have sex?

[Here are some details about her speech](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/28/germaine-greer-returns-to_n_6561232.html)

&gt; She continued: ""I didnât know there was such a thing [as transphobia]. Arachnaphobia, yes. Transphobia, no.â

&gt; [In her book,] Greer described trans women as ""men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated"".

&gt; According to Greer, the actions of transgender people are counteracting today's attempts to defeat stereotypes about women. She insists you cannot be a woman because you ""want"" to be: ""Thereâs a hardship about being a woman...I always wanted to be a Jew, but I canât be.""

&gt; She went on to suggest that trans women are not women because they do not know what it is like âto have a big, hairy, smelly vaginaâ.

My answer would simply be the truth. It doesn't have to be forensic proof of innocence. 

CPS will assess all the evidence collected including my answers, and make a judgement on whether it's likely that a jury will find me guilty of the crime based on that evidence. If my answer is along the lines of 'well she didn't say no' they are probably going to take a dim view especially if it's someone I just met who has turned round and said I raped her along with witness evidence that she was passing in and out of consciousness. It's about the  picture that the whole set of evidence paints. Contrary to popular belief women don't turn around and accuse people of rape for shits and giggles, it's a serious allegation and the police (should be) taking it seriously as well. 

Consider that if you have a fender bender nowadays the police confiscate your phone to see if you were using it, that in a serious case of rape they're not even asking how you know the consent was given is ridiculous. They should be collecting your clothes, your bedsheets and treating it like the serious criminal investigation it is. Police shouldn't have to be told how to investigate a crime.

More than half of women offenders do have dependent children. Typically the father is not caring for the child either. Those are the social circumstances.

We are not the 'good guys', fighting against evil tyranny.

That's simply the way the government spins it to drum up support for invervention.

Our interest in the Middle East is purely self serving. The reason why the intervene in the middle east and not in the countless other hotspots around the world is because there's a financial incentive.

We don't care about the suffering of the people there. We propped up and supported Suddam Hussains tyrannical regime until he started acting against our interests. We supported Bin Laden when he was killing Russian troops and not our own. 

The west is worried about ISIS because they're a threat to our own interests in the region, not because they're killing innocent civilians. We've proven countless times that we're willing to turn a blind eye to that sort of stuff if it's in our interest to do so. 

&gt; So you are saying because we fucked up we should not try to do anything good in the region ever again? Including halting genocide?

No, I'm saying that us intervening in the region has never done anything but make things worse. Right back to the first world war and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

I find it so upsetting that there don't seem to be those who will take an evidencial, logical approach to policy rather than making knee-jerk reactions based on... nothing, really. I am perfectly happy to concede that people have different opinions to me; I can respect those, or even have my mind changed, when they are presented with evidence and causality. But this minister just makes me feel victimised because of my gender (male).

Criminals with mental health problems sometimes may be better treated in hospital; fair enough. Back it up with evidence and studies, though. People with caring responsibilities perhaps should have that taken into account in some way; fair enough. But those groups can be male or female; it may be that it turns out more women fall into those groups than men. But that's a side-effect, a symptom. Maybe that leads on to a discussion of why women have more caring responsibilities than men: is that because women's choices are more limited? Or men are forced into certain roles and caring is seen as female domains? Maybe it is built in to the genders somehow that women are more drawn to bringing up kids while men go out. My instinct is to say a it is a combination of the first two, perhaps with the current political mood giving less attention to the male side of things (I personally feel that the fight for gender equality is rather one-sided in recent times, biased heavily in favour of women). I'm not sure about the third; in all cases, evidence and research are the way to reach a scientific conclusion. But then to make the jump to 'women shouldn't be in prison for the same crimes as men' is idiotic.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Actually this isn't the case. Believe it or not, when we start life there are about 104 boys born for every 100 girls. Nobody is entirely sure why but the most widely accepted theory is the lack of full XX chromsomes in male XY sperm somehow gives them a very slight advantage (i.e. more likely to successfully fuse with an egg cell).

By about age 10 this difference in gender distribution is eliminated, as boys are more likely to die from genetic conditions (the downside of having only a partial second copy of the X chromosome). In addition boys are more likely to die accidentally (which continues throughout their life) and this is attributed to greater risk taking behaviors - which is probably both genetic and cultural.  

In later life women are less likely to develop many of the big killers at a young age, like cardiovascular disease. In that case it is thought the protective effect of higher levels of oestrogen in the blood are the reason why. That benefit is lost after the menopause and so women tend to develop them slightly later.

There are also a number of cultural changes that are responsible;

* Traditionally few women smoked. However, there was a shift that began in the 1940s through to the 1970s where women smoked more. If you look at the rate of lung cancer in women it is actually going up, and that is why - because those women are now entering into their 60s/70s/80s and suffering the consequences of those behaviors... whilst comparatively fewer men now smoke. 

* Men traditionally worked in dangerous manual industries where they were more likely to die from accidents or industrial illnesses (like [mesothelioma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma), [pneumoconiosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumoconiosis) or a [German bullet to the face](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I)). Shifts in the working patterns of the western world have meant both genders are now more likely to work in comparatively safer office environments.  

**TL:DR** It isn't so much that the gap is simply narrowing... it's that the reasons men used to die young are improving faster than those for women, because in many cases the reasons men die are modifiable (i.e. smoking, dangerous work)... where the reasons women die tend to be due to more difficult to tackle things (i.e. cancers, frailty, pneumonia etc).

... that's the Crown Estate

&gt;In 1760 George III surrendered the right to govern in person, and as a result the monarch's entitlement to the revenue of the Crown Estate, which was transferred to HM Treasury.

Presently the Queen owns the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and you could make clear cases for both to be returned to the public trust. They are owned by the Sovereign, not by Elizabeth as a private citizen.

She - the person - *actually* owns Sandringham and Balmoral, and nobody knows what her personal fortune is, though likely in the region of hundreds of millions.

Surveys of tourists are irrelevant though aren't they, if they're not borne out by facts. Surveys from *attractions* however, that tally visitor numbers, are a better indication of what's actually popular:

Especially videos that you can watch in private, on your own.  Even talking about sex with your idiotic peers is embarassing -- none of them will want to admit what they do or don't know or have or have not done.  So give them the opportunity to be embarassed alone, and it will all go much better.

Facing a real person telling you; probably someone who you (as a 14 year old) consider old and disgusting talking to you about dicks and fannys... just embarassing.  So much so, that the rushing sound of white noise filling your head probably means you would hear nothing.  You certainly aren't going to ask genuine questions.

Provide a reasonable resource... say a youtube channel with ""realistic"" porn -- i.e. actual people having actual sex, shown in glorious technicolour, with all their bumps and squishy bits not chiselled, inflated, plasticised actors; with the real before and after.   Jesus, a video that shows the clenched naked waddle to the toilet to try not to get a mess on your Mum's best sofa would be an epihpany for most kids.  Doing all the stuff that and intermix it with interviews with them about what is going on.  Then just point kids at it.

Back it up with some in person classes where the embarassment factor can now be much lower to cover the mechanics and health issues, and tada -- sex education that might actually be educational instead of uncomfortable.

But in reality almost none of them will engage in any of it. In reality, even most adults with many years of sexual experience don't. Wanting to know about it doesn't mean we want to do all of it.

There's now a national competition to see who can pretend to be the most broad-minded, resulting in people whose sex lives with their spouses are happy and fulfilling with about three favourite positions and a couple of toys for the weekend telling everyone that teens need to be handed a laundry list of sexual activities, most of which they'll absolutely fucking hate, and told that this what people do.

Most real sex lives are fun, sometimes hard work and vary just a little from time to time. And that includes gay sex lives - I'm bisexual and my relationships with men would hardly have made my parents blush.

One of the best parts of sex is finding out for yourself what you and your partner enjoy.

Is that right? What was the last law the queen passed? What was the last tax she levied? What was the last war she declared or the last parliament she formed or dismissed in order to exercise her will? What is the queen's will at this moment, by the way? What's her strategic plan for the country? What are her policies? 

Yeah, that's what I thought. 

Like I said, you clearly don't understand what a constitutional monarchy is or how it came about, so...

&gt; Your argument seems to be that because the law *could* change to take her status away, then it's ok that she is unelected.

It doesn't seem like that. It seems like my argument was exactly how I wrote it: That the main function of a sitting monarch is to provide continuity of various governments irrespective of party leaning, and whose only powers come from democratic institutions/the constitutional rules *we* allow that monarch to have. And that state of affairs only exists because it was a decision arrived at *democratically*.

Therefore statements like ""she is a symbol of anti-democracy"" are at once ignorant - since the role of the monarch facilitates democracy and mitigates against *actual* tyranny (such as that currently seen in Putin's Russia), and meaningless - as if the role of the monarch in British government is anti-democracy, then so is every other position not subject to election - such as the appointed senior civil servants and policy advisors whose work *actually* actually affects our lives.

This majority of this subreddit this season absolutely hounds on Schurrle after a bad half to one season. Just look at this thread and the false/exaggerated things said in here. I've seen people get downvoted for simply wanting him to get a couple more chances over Willian. He's had a bad illness and it takes time and games to recover. Also, it's not a fucking coincidence that almost our bench players are so much more inconsistent compared to the depth of other big clubs. Some people on here sound like they're never played the sport. *You think you're going to be in good form when once every few weeks you get the odd cup match or the rare PL game where rotation is forced because of match congestion?* Fuck no. The only exceptions have been Cech and Remy. Cech makes sense as he's a keeper and that doesn't require much game time to play well. Remy has been fantastic the 200 or so pathetically little amount of minutes he has, yet he's inexplicably third choice over Drogba, no matter how much I love the legend. 

This sub, just like the rest of reddit, is a huge victim to recency bias and have the mentality of ""if you weren't World Class your last start mate, you're shit and we need to ship you off for a dream signing!"" Some of these comments are so ridiculous. Are you really shocked that Willian has better chemistry with the team when he plays every single PL match with like 9 other typical starters? How is a player recovering from illness going to have that chemistry when he plays with only other forced rotation players and the one real chance he gets with the starters in months, he's subbed off in 45 minutes? Some even suggest that he's anti-Willian when it's not even true. He tracks back almost as much, we wouldn't be leaking goals if he was on form and playing. In fact, we might even do better because it wouldn't force Ivanovic to come up so often because Schurrle's better at crossing, creating chances with his off the ball runs and a much better finisher. That might help our defense when we're not caught out of position so often and it's not a counter against just Cahill, Terry and Dave/Luis.

Also, why is Willian so immune to criticism? Because tracks back a lot? People got downvoted for saying in the game threads and post game threads of the second Swansea game that he should *at least* had shots on target when he's in point blank range &lt;10 yards from goal. Apparently it's also ""way too harsh"" or being a prick to say he shouldn't be missing a wide open 4 yard pass to a trailing Costa against Liverpool. Every argument for Willian is the same vague nonsense that sounds nice and smart but has zero substance. ""Oh I just like what he brings to the team and the balance, we'd be so screwed if he wasn't so defensive! He's not overrated, it's his role forcing these poor final balls and poor shots, I tell you! You think he's inconsistent? Mate, here's a whopping 3 screamers he's scored the past 2 seasons. Look at his 3rd assist this entire season. It's truly master class to put a cross in the middle of the box to an unmarked Ivanovic. Every knows Youtube highlight mixes are completely objective scout reports. Like Cuadrado's an upgrade!

Simply put we don't help him out, he wants the play making to happen from the right so he has space to get behind he fullback or cut in.  Making so much part from the left due to hazard really diminishes his talents. 
In a way getting cuadrado would help schurrle because cuadrado is a reliable player to balls in the area on dangerous areas but can be inconsistent in where they go. He draws players to him much like hazard because if you keep one player on him he can zoom past or win a dangerous freekick. 
Suddenly schurrle can come in from the left and curl one on from a scrappy ball or with a quick switch of play actually have space to get behind his man.

Cuadrado just offers more in terms of options compared to schurrle.

null,false,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,null,"&gt; About 1% of the population is gay and the rest don't need to be taught how. Simple answer, although I expect you won't like it.  

Disagree entirely. What about LGBT children in the classroom/school?  

More like 1.5% anyway and the ONS didn't ask pre-16s.  

&gt; People aged 16 and over were questioned about their self-perceived sexual identity, and asked to respond with one of four options: heterosexual/straight, gay/lesbian, bisexual or other. The data showed that 95% said they were heterosexual, 1% gay or lesbian, 0.5% bisexual, 0.5% other, and the remaining 3% either did not know or did not answer.  

There's also this from YouGov  

&gt; The average British person knows 5.5 gay men and 3.1 gay women. According to government estimates, around 6% of the UK population are lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB).

Look at the current political debates. As soon as the Green party were included, the question became not about what they offer, but about why the DUP were excluded. And if they were included, then even more fringe parties would feel they were the ones out in the cold.

Should we teach kids about BDSM in sex education classes? It's a fairly common and normal sexual kink. There's nothing wrong with it. I think it would be healthy for society if we did.

But now we're not talking about BDSM. We're talking about scat. Why aren't we teaching kids about scat and scat porn and all those kinds of more fringe fetishes. They're just as normal as anything else.

To exclude them would be to make a judgment call on what is and is not 'normal', or 'acceptable'. And that's a dangerous road.

These things do not have to be taught by school mandate. Sex education should be more than it is, I agree, but it should remain focused on specifics and be limited in scope.

You say relationship advice' as though that were a teachable subject. What could a teacher possibly tell her students about relationships that would have any real world meaning? Your proposals are both too vague and too specific. Sex education should be health focused (body and mind), and inclusive without being discriminatory.

null,false,steakforthesun,null,null,null,"&gt; About 1% of the population is gay and the rest don't need to be taught how. Simple answer, although I expect you won't like it.

So you believe that something that isn't useful to you shouldn't be taught in schools?

Look at it this way - about 1% of the population needs to know that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but it's taught to all of us.  I'm a graphic designer and don't use French in my day to day life, does that mean I should never have been taught it?  Education isn't just what you need to know at a practical level.

Anyway, what /u/scisteve is saying is to teach *all* about LGBT stuff, not just ""this is how sex works, there you go you've learned now"" as you seem to be thinking.  I'm not gay, but I can see there's a huge amount of prejudice around LGBT people and more education can only help with that.

&gt;How? How did you manage to mess up sex in any way that was harmful rather than funny?!?!!? I'm bisexual and I'm really struggling to imagine how you managed to fuck up having sex in a way that you can blame on someone else.

Again, getting the sex wrong is not the only way to fuck up.  Contraception, STIs, STDs, relationships, it goes on.  Yes, I think parents should be doing more to educate their children on these matters but the majority appear to steer clear of it (mine certainly did).

&gt;__Thorium-based nuclear power__ is [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor)-based electrical power generation fueled primarily by the fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element [thorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium). According to proponents, a [thorium fuel cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle) offers several potential advantages over a [uranium fuel cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_fuel_cycle)âincluding much [greater abundance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium#Occurrence) on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. However, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. Proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium, while critics say that development of [breeder reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor) in general (including thorium reactors that are breeders by nature) increase proliferation concerns. Since about 2008, nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply nuclear fuel in place of [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium) to generate [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power). This renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences, the latest of which, ThEC13   was held at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) by [iThEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Thorium_Energy_Committee) and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries.

Well, to be fair, a lot of parents probably *want* the Government to handle it, so they don't have to. Whether that be in school, or on the internet, they just want to know something is being done to teach their kids the facts so life so they can avoid that awkward conversation.  If someone tells them they'll do all they can to stop their kids accessing porn for them, so they can just ignore their kids curiosity and desires until ""they are old enough"" (i.e. once they've left home) then they probably just sit back and let it happen

It's a very old fashioned way of thinking but I think that's probably how a lot of the more prudish/ashamed/uncomfortable parents see it.   I remember my mum telling me her first husbands parents left a book on his pillow the day he was leaving for the navy called ""The Dangers of Masturbation"" ... this would have been about 40 years ago now, and they are very Christian for what it's worth, but the guy would have been 18 I think.

Castrated men don't produce anywhere near as much testosterone because they have lost the Leydig cells in their testes that make the bulk of it. As a result their [hypothalamic-pituitary-axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis) detects low levels of circulating testosterone and releases more gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone in an attempt to boost levels, which in turn causes more release of Lutenizing hormone (LH) and follice-stimulating-hormone (FSH). This basically acts to shift the balance towards oestradiol rather than testosterone. Thus the benefit is more of higher circulating oestradiol rather than low testosterone.

But there are loads of good reports out there summing it up. Just stick in 'How do we know humans are changing the climate' into google and you'll get a wealth of decent information. 

The first and perhaps most interesting bit of evidence for me personally is the fact that our current knowledge of natural cycles, taken from both models and observations of proxy records, simply can not account for the observed changes within the climate.

Climate change predictions are mostly done via computer modelling. When comparing models which do not take into account human influence, the models have simply been unable to replicate the observed changes of the past half a century or so. 

Once human influences have been accounted for, the models replicate the observed changes far more accurately.

Like I said, there is a wealth of fairly simplistic yet accurate information out there if you are interested.

The feeling I get is that many people see education as a competition, where the children who achieve the most are the ones that work hardest and are ""smartest"". They deserve to get the higher grades, and giving a second chance to the less intelligent kids is not fair on the smarter ones who did well first time. 

But I don't agree with that way of thinking. Education shouldn't be a competition. The kids that don't do so well should absolutely have the opportunity to try again.

Well fuck that - I'm staying positive. I'm not even going to bait the kippers. 

Look at this: 

&gt; On one wall on the first floor, it reads: âO mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and communities that you might get to know one another.â Qurâan 49:13

&gt; Elsewhere: âIf you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain, âMove from here to thereâ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.â Matthew 17:20.

Fucking brilliant. And it gets better: 

&gt; Ofsted, which ranked the school outstanding following its visit in 2011, highlighted the âoutstanding spiritual, moral, social and cultural developmentâ among students. It also **singled out for praise âan ethos for learning that nurtures mutual respect and tolerance, motivates students and encourages their positive self-esteem, particularly for Muslim girlsâ**.

And how about this for a reasonable perspective? 

&gt; Ask Mockbill about British values and he says: âItâs just common sense. You donât need to be a rocket scientist. Itâs good morals, good behaviour. Itâs in every culture.â

&gt; âRelationships are really, really strong,â says Gould [head teacher]. âThese groups are very strongly committed to working together. But itâs a day-by-day, living-out-our-experience kind of working towards building this thing. **Itâs not about great big public displays and announcements and demonstrations. Itâs got to be done over a long period of time**.â

&gt;

&gt;The __Honda NC700 series__ is a family of [motorcycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle) produced by [Honda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda) since 2012. NC700 series was a 'new concept' bike designed for commuters, new or veteran riders. The series also includes the motorcycle/scooter hybrid [NC700D Integra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_NC700D_Integra).

&gt;The NC700 series is classed as a commuter model bike which has incorporated design and mechanical elements from various motorcycle types. The riding position is similar to standard bike styles. There is a helmet-sized internal storage in place of the traditional fuel tank, which in turn is located under the seat.  The series is often marketed as fun to ride, easy to handle and very fuel efficient.

*Expensive/touristy*

Turf tavern. Very famous, lots of tourists. Decent beer/venue but quite expensive. Crowd is mixed.

The Bear. Very famous, fewer tourists. Possibly more expensive than the Turf. Oldest pub in Oxford I think. Crowd is not young.

The Kings Arms. Not sure if it's particularly famous but lots of people go there. Nice pub, quite loud. Similar prices to Turf but more space. Crowd is mixed. Quiz machine!!!

*Expensive/not touristy*

The Red lion. Fairly recently done up, quite nice interior. Slightly cheaper than the Kings Arms. Fairly young crowd.

*Cheap and cheerful*

Four Candles. Classic spoons, but the better of the two. Mixed crowd.

Swan and Castle. Another spoons, worse than 4 Candles. Young crowd.

3 Goats Head. My personal favourite on the list. Cheap bear, (not a huge selection) nice people (young) and decent venue. Only downside is it's a little small, no music, can be crowded if only the downstairs is open.

Plus as a result of his decreased mobility, he could no longer do things he loved like jousting or tennis. In addition to losing his favourite sports, some of his only pleasures left were food and drink and he began putting on enormous weight.  Which all made him grumpy.

Plus he was the younger child, and according to some historical record he was a very pampered and indulged child who was basically spoiled rotten. This trend continued with his wives and advisors who seemed to only tell him what he wanted to hear.

Then when Anne Boleyn got her eyes on the throne, she started using foreign scholars to basically convince him that his desire was the same thing as God's will.  Many of his advisors were also trying to convince him that his other advisors were spies against him, that he shouldn't trust them, until eventually he didn't trust anyone.

While many of the existing welfare programs such as JSA would be removed, some things such as housing benefit will still cost far more and cannot be removed by a basic income. In regards to pensions, they promise to increase pensions to about Â£170 a week.

Current estimates of the Green parties welfare programme are on the order of more than 500bn a year. Consider that the current budget is about 732bn a year with a 80bn deficit. Current plans for welfare at at 119bn a year.

Combine this with the Green's policy on immigration and you have an economic catastrophe for the country. Why is immigration an issue here? Well they want a completely open border policy in addition to all benefits being given to everyone on British soil.

null,false,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,null,"Sex education shouldn't just be about a teacher standing in front of a class explaining to everyone how to operate their genitals. Sex is a massive part of human culture and ought to be addressed as such. 

Do you happen to know where the 1% figure come from and what it actually represents? It must surely only be people who ""identify"" as gay. As a bisexual yourself, you must surely appreciate that sexuality is rather more fluid than ""this person is straight, this person is gay"" and without proper education and support, some young people may find it difficult to come to terms with the idea that they may not, in fact, be entirely one or the other. 

Again, this doesn't have to be in the form of a teacher telling the whole class that it's ""OK to be gay"". It could just as easily be in the form of access to information/advice for any curious student. Even something as simple as being prepared to answer questions for anyone that has them. 

Finally, do you not feel that it would be helpful for non-gay kids to have a better understanding of the members of their society that are? Ignorance is often the source of fear, so removing that ignorance would surely help to alleviate a lot of the issues that people's fear causes to the LGBT community.

Sadly, You're not the only one, I always believe Schurrle is a great player when he performs ( one might argue everyone does that, but nom take Ferreira as an example ) post-WC Schurrle has been in a dipping form, but he is doing what he do best in the field, I believe we'll agree everyone in Chelsea does that, and we'll not going to rule that out. I'm not making any statement that Schurrle &gt; Juan or Juan &gt; Schurrle, but when Schurrle is on the ball, I'm always worried what will he do, cause most of the time, he's taking a speculative shot, losing balls, but he do have some pace to cope with, unlike Hazard, I never actually worried if Hazard gets the ball, because he's more stable than Schurrle ( In my humble opinion ). 

To quote GoonSalmon: ""... but [Schurrle] gets too much love around ere when he hasn't really done anything."" Again we take Ferreira for example, he hasnt really performing in the full back position, but he never actually flops, he's always a 7 rated guy, but he get the love around when he hasn't really done ""that much"". And i think it's only fair to say that CFC fans love Schurrle mostly because he's humble. Sure he does takes his chances one too many often but that doesn't make us less caring about him. He's still a great lad, and isn't ruining the team spirit by yapping too much in the bench. 

To whatever may occurs to him in the future, I'll always say good luck to him.

&gt; 
&gt; Good to know.

Presumably we'd have an air force but no Navy - just  a coast guard.

Being an island nation, our Navy is about Force Projection. We need an AF to maintain control of our airspace, but if we were withdrawing all military operations to sole defence of the British Isles then a fleet of small vessels for coastal defence, customs, etc would suffice, with the Air Force able to launch Air-Ship missiles and Torpedoes against an invading armada.

Of course that's not the position we're in. Many Caribbean nations are protectorates (of one legal sort or another) of the UK, as is Gibraltar, as are the Falklands. So scrapping our Naval Force-Projection capability eliminates our *independent* ability to honour our responsibilities to those areas. Of course we can still get there provided we have friendly nations that we can fly over and land at to refuel, but if, say, Spain and France refused over-flights to transit to Gibraltar, our inability to send a few ships and/or a carrier group around to Gib using Atlantic International Waters would be problematic.",null,0,null,1422547091,null,0,false,0,co4p7t7,null,t3_2tzzf9,null,t1_co4p7t7,null,t1_co4hysp,null,null,null,1424324621,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Unfortunately, I don't think most of the people who really want female characters so bad are capable of that kind of good writing. They want female characters because they want to preach at us, not because females bring a valuable different perspective.

I would have more problems with Doctor Who not being British though. If it's no longer OK to expect the star of a British TV show to be a British person then where is it OK to have British people working? Notice that I said British, not white. A nationality or culture, not a race. Doctor Who is a British show, not a white people show. There's a growing black population in Britain, so if Doctor Who became black, that'd be fine -- at long as he's a British black. And it still has to be a very special person in any case, like every Doctor.

1) We can pay him as much or more than anyone in the world

3) A large and seemingly ever-growing French/francophone connection (no pun intended) at our club. TourÃ©, Nasri, Sagna, Clichy, Bony, Kompany speaks French, Mangala, not to mention the idea of working with Vieira whom Pogba almost certainly has idolized his whole life.

4) He would fit right into our system and probably play the best football of his life, doing exactly what he's good at.

Boycotting and sanctioning an entire nation is very common. The UK does it all the time. We're sanctioning Russia right now. It's a legitimate form of inducing action from a country. When a nation does something objectionable and refuses to change it's behaviour then boycotting/sanctioning them is a non-violent tool. Gandhi used to champion for Indians to stop buying British products. It hurt innocent working class people in the UK who weren't in charge of the British policy on India. You know what? It was supposed to work that way. The British economy for 200 years was supported by feeding on India. Working class people didn't care about India and they wanted them to get agitated enough to pressure the British government. Martin Luther King Jr had Blacks boycott Buses in Montgomery. It was economically devastating to since blacks were the majority of bus riders. The transport company didn't create Jim Crow laws but they enforced it. The pressure they exerted and the attention the boycott gave to MLK led to bus segregation ending.

For that price you could easily get a better burger from a place in the city.

The food is obviously streets ahead of any fast food place (McDonalds, burger king etc) but not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.

They have accepted immigration policies that have filled our cities with disaffected Muslims, many of whom have now gone to fight against us in Syria and Iraq. They have accepted the growth of Islamic schools in which children are taught to prepare themselves for jihad against the surrounding social order. They have accepted the constant denigration of their country, its institutions and its inherited religion, for the simple reason that these things are theirs and therefore tainted with forbidden loyalties.

Vanguard's view differs slightly, and they effectively believe everybody should have a global hedged bond portfolio. This has its advantages and disadvantages - you take on large US exposure but also have some of the ""QE effect"" of UK gilts removed thanks to other global diversification.

Based on current inflation of ~1.0% then this is effectively paying inflation +1%, which is roughly the long-term average bond returns.

Alternatively you could just go with cash instruments. Taking your argument further, the best ""defensive"" cash account is actually a current account with Santander.

Likewise, the issue of gender roles in industry isn't going to be resolved by an interest group that only want to elevate, not demote women. It would result a Health &amp; Safety at Work for Men Act (if the notion was reversed).

the easiest way to describe taxes is for you to google 'uk wage calc' and put in your expected salary , assuming you are working a standard uk salary job and not freelance, that will break down your taxes better than we can.

electricity and gas vary depending on your family size, kinda hard to say. I'd expect an adult to spend about 100-150 a month on gas/electric/water, but in my house 2 adults spend that. It really varies a lot.

council tax also needs paying , its approx Â£100 a month but it varies on the local council and the size of your house, you'd have to check with them. 

what kind of insurance ?

internet/phone is typically Â£30 a month. no idea on TV as i don't pay for it, freeview + iplayer and netflix do me just fine.

A few of my lecturers have said there probably isn't much point doing the GIS MSc my university offers as much of what is taught has already been covered across my 3 years, the MSc really seems to be catering for people from environmental science backgrounds who've had no experience of GIS.

On top of that, doing one purely for programming knowledge seems a bit wasteful when I could learn that elsewhere/potentially study something else.

Agreed. I agree that with the right attitude and moderation, pornography, much like alcohol, can be totally fine.

People learning all they need to know about sex from it though is a depressing thought. They'll grow up thinking that sex is some sort of extreme performance art. Not a deep connection between two human beings. I think it's time to grow up a bit in our public attitudes towards sex otherwise something else will end up filling the vacuum.

This seems to be talking just about charging people, which is still a very unpleasant thing to happen if you are innocent but thankfully not the same as a conviction. 

I think the idea is probably as follows. There are many rapes that are not investigated because it is hard to prove that consent was not given, or because the victim didn't go to the police believing rightly or wrongly that it wouldn't be investigated. There are also a few false accusations. The suspicion is I suppose that the latter are few and far between while the former are huge in number. 

It seems to me that there are issues with all methods, but that charging standards will still be in place and anyone charged as the result of complete negligence, without any evidence at all, will be protected by the law. I can't see an increase in wrongful convictions as a result of it, since juries will be doing the same job they always have. It might encourage more rape victims to speak up, though.

It is convention however the issue of peers being PM nearly caused the whole world to change. In 1940, when the war was going exceptionally poorly, the most popular man in British politics was Lord Halifax. The vast majority of the media and the public wanted him to be PM.

This would have been a disaster as Halifax was a Nazi sympathiser and believed that we could have negotiated with Mussolini's offering in 1940 (Mussolini was essentially a puppet of Hitler) and ended the war then. Halifax truly believed that Hitler would treat us well as we had chosen peace (and privately he also believed that because we are also Aryan).

Halifax was then offered the PM position but thankfully turned it down. He believed it was wrong for a non-elected official to become PM. Instead Winston Churchill took his place and the rest is history.

They should just write it that Time Lord gender and racial choice when regenerating is largely dependent on their own genetics. Whether their parents were very capable of controlling their identities upon regeneration or not. Whereas, say Romana could easily and swiftly change her appearance while in a regeneration cycle, possibly because one or both her parents were also masters at it, or both were only moderately capable of changing appearance, but their offspring would naturally be better at it, etc... So, the Doctor either being of mixed lineage (human/time-lord) or both Time Lord parents just didn't have the genetic modifiers to make it easy or have the ability to control it at all. Perhaps he has no genetic markers for it at all, thus training on how to control it wouldn't even work?

If one was in a relationship with someone, and that person then became financially dependent on you, the prosecution would have a hard time proving that you believed they no longer consented to sex - previous sexual activity could easily be raised by the defendant to prove they had a reasonable belief in consent. In contrast, if the defendant's gf tells him 'I don't want to have sex with you any more' you have two diverging options - you can terminate the relationship, as is your right, but if you instead continue and have sex with her, fully realising the only reason she's doing so is because she needs you to put a roof over her head, then that may be seen as rape.  Another way to look at it is: you can keep financially supporting someone because you feel it is your moral obligation, but if you then demand sex that they are not interested in giving in return, that is financially manipulated rape.

The court transcript says he left via a fire exit. Makes no mention as to whether it was open, locked, alarmed etc... I think by saying crept you're throwing your bias into it.

It's also worth noting that when she had a blood test the next morning she showed no traces of alcohol

From the transcript:

&gt;As a result of an 
examination of the samples, at that stage, notwithstanding the direct evidence that she had had a 
good deal to drink the evening before, no alcohol was detected.

The independent expert brought in by the defence also said at the blood alcohol level he would expect her to be from what she described, he would not expect memory loss as the complainant described.

From the transcript:

&gt;The expert called by the defence calculated that the complainant's likely blood-alcohol level 
at about 4am would have approximated to something like 2Â½ times the legal driving limit. He 
gave evidence that she would have suffered from slurred speech and unsteadiness of gait, but he 
would not have expected any memory loss. It was an essential part of his expert evidence that 
there were significant doubts about the claim made by the complainant that she had suffered a 
memory loss. In effect, it was suggested that her assertion was false. 

At the end of the day, the guy is guilty. Whether he did get consent or not, he's still guilty as long as the courts uphold the decision. If whatever evidence he has now submitted clears his name then great, I'd hate to see someone punished for something they shouldn't be.

Napoleon invited the Spanish King and Heir to France to discuss peaceful matters after giving them a pasting a few years before in the Pyrenees war.

I'd also like to take some time to explain why your post was removed in greater detail, because I feel you're owed that.

You see, the guidelines were created cooperatively between the users of the community and the moderators. Every guideline we've put into our guideline was put in by suggestion from the community in response to their wants and needs. 

Just like we don't allow pictures of ordinary cracks or pictures of tally-marks or pictures of ordinary statues of angels, we don't allow content unrelated to Doctor Who. This includes pictures of actors outside of Doctor Who roles (particularly actors who've never been in Doctor Who at all).

This is to keep the Doctor Who subreddit actually related to Doctor Who. It's not fair to our users to clog a subreddit meant to be dedicated solely to Doctor Who with images of random actors.

If you'd like to discuss potential casting choices, you're free to do so. In fact, we encourage it! But we do ask that you do so in a self post out of respect for other users and the community's guidelines.

As for your complaint that ""everyone clearly liked the post"": /r/DoctorWho is home to nearly a quarter of a million users. It's our job as moderators to look after the interests of the entire community, not just the small portion of it that upvoted your post.

He's not my fave Doctor but I've learned to appreciate what he brought to the table. With that said, I'm not sure whether or not I can agree with him here. 

With all the regenerations a Gallifreyan can do, it's clear the carbon based humanoid form is just an exoskeleton that they have learned to replace now and again, like when we buy a new car. However, because The Doctor's always surprised when he finds himself in a new body, it's not like he gets to consciously choose whether or not he's ginger for example. While at the same time, there does seem to be a component that the Gallifreyan seems to get what he needs to serve his purposes in his future, whether he likes it or not. While it may not always appear his new body is suitable to his current condition, he grows accustomed to it quickly and it usually serves him well. I think there's an unconscious component involved, where the Gallifreyan's able to have some level of input on what's intrinsically good for his, for lack of a better word, soul. The question is not whether or not a Gallifreyan can change genders. That's as easy as changing eye color or the number of hearts. The question is, would *our* The Doctor want or need to change genders? Is it in his character to intrinsically ever 'go there' to him/her/itself? 

It made sense that The Master would do that cuz s/he/it is effing insane. Not that transgender humans are insane i'm NOT implying that. Well. Okay. I have this running hypothesis that we are all crazy. You, me, everybody. Just in different ways. Sometimes transgender exploration is how a person copes. It's therapy. Other times it's not. There's no way to know for sure with each individual when it's helpful or harmful or harmless or who cares, etc. but fiction is one place where we can explore these possibilities in a safer way without everyone getting all offended. In The Master's case, he's trying to find himself. He's been having identity issues for some time. This is kinda consistent throughout the run of the series. It just makes sense in a weird way that The Master's 'soul' for lack of a better word, would need to try this out. 

I'm not sure if I buy that The Doctor is having the same kind of issues. He's just as crazy as The Master but in vastly different ways. **If the franchise ever decides to make The Doctor a woman I hope it's cuz they found the best PERSON for the role** and there are some women out there who would throw down a mean Doctor. It's not out of the question entirely. I wouldn't want them to do it just to do it. It would need to intrinsically make sense for where the character's headspace is at at the time. 

It's not that a Gallifreyan gets to choose who s/he looks like in a regeneration. It feels like something out of the Gallifreyan's control makes the final choice. Like their inner self files a request with the universe and they get whatever rolls out of the proverbial factory. If the show runners ever do play with The Doctor's gender, it might open a can of worms they won't be able to close. It would mean They'd need to explore in more detail through the narrative course of that season just how the regeneration process actually works, and some secrets are best kept hidden.

I didn't really accuse you of it though, I was just asking if you thought it the smearing does anything positive? This comment thread is off the back of someone asking not to blame the liberal left and your response is unclear to me, it seems you are blaming the entire left side of politics.

&gt; Hence the nonsense we got from Birmingham Council, where they found that 75% of perpetrators of street grooming were Pakistani, and their final publication stated it happens among all ethnic groups. It's technically true, but entirely misleading.

This is not a ""left"" only thing, this is a British thing. There are plenty of voices on the left, like me, who would never stand for something like that. Even left leaning papers like the Guardian publish the stats, not the sort of blurring you've just described. And similarly, there are plenty on the right who also prefer not to confront people doing horrible things.

Yes this has happened under two left leaning councils, is that proof it's a problem with the left, or is it just that the problem happens in communities with many immigrants, which just so happen to vote more left than right?

As soon as you try to assign the blame to the left or right, you are playing a shitty game which isn't even based in reality. A lot of these PC nonsense comes from the traditional British distaste for offending, something the right and left both have.

&gt;but let's not pretend that their judgments don't take place in a wider intellectual culture.

In fact they still have one of football's richest investors in Berlusconi, it's just a combination of him being unwilling to spend money on the club, hence the many calls for a new owner, and Italy's current soccer crisis. The old men quite frankly retired at the worst time possibly.

I feel PSG's biggest problem in the future won't be money, but attracting top level players at a good rate. Of course a single season won't do them in, but the club is in a bit of an odd situation. Ligue 1 isn't considered as great as the top 4 leagues, and on top of that PSG is not looking likely to finish top of the table, they might not even grab a CL spot. Suddenly they're in a position where they'll have to try really hard to convince top players to go to PSG over clubs like Juve, Real, Chelsea or City, which is a challenge in itself, but the biggest killer comes in the form of FFP which will stop them from completely overhauling the team like they've done in the past. I don't think they're going to sink to Milan levels (aka mid-table Serie A team), but I think it'll be some time before they'll begin dominating the league again.

I went quite out on a limb there I guess, we were discussing Pogba and on that note I simply agree with your last sentence, at City he can keep on playing his own style since it fits us while not facing major competition for his spot like he'd do at Real.

But if I said that ""the matriarchy forces men to work like horses until they die so that they can relax and enjoy life"" I would sound like a bloody idiot. That is what I feel 'feminism' is turning into.

First world countries really need to move away from this idea of 'women against men' and 'everything is the patriarchy's fault'. 'Feminism' is nowadays a misnomer because the word itself is intrinsically biased towards women. There was a time where women were institutionally discriminated against, and feminism was an incredible force for equality then, but that era is ending - there are now gender issues on both sides, and the insistence of some ""feminists"" that ""everything is created by men, for men, help I'm being oppressed"" is counter-productive. Some feminists need to accept that not everything is about them, and 'those misogynistic pigs' (for lack of better words) need to accept that society does sometimes discriminate against women.

We need to address these problems as a *society*. There are a number of people who call themselves 'feminists' whose opinions are better described as 'egalitarian', and I really hope that 'feminism' will continue re-branding itself as 'egalitarianism' or 'gender equality' over the coming decades. Then we might actually be able to have some actual discussion on the topic rather than the knee jerk reaction 'feminism' creates.

That said, there are some countries out there that really need feminism - I propose we send all the radical feminists over there!

null,false,king_duck,null,null,null,"&gt; the person earning Â£20k would now get Â£35k, the dude who earns nothing as he does not have a job (by choice or not) gets Â£15k to live his life.

Right so either the pound is devalued, or we'll have a hard time selling anything over seas. Why would anyone buy anything (including services) when labour is much more expensive, never mind the tax rate.

Now 35k now would only be worth 20k; meaning that 15k is worth less than 10k.

&gt; then he would be incentivised to go and find work but not forced to for fear of starvation.

But the work would have to pay quite a considerable bit more than 15k because who in the right mind wold give a up a secure wage doing nothing for a full time job only paying a few K more?

&gt; Those who want to pursue their own goals will be able to do so and some of those goals will be a net ""profit"" for society.

I'd happily spend all day everyday cycling and training for races, I'd happily do it for 15k. But lets be honest:

 1. That's not likely to benefit society -- not really
 2. For every person who would do something constructive there is going to be N people doing fuck all.
 3. Who is going to do all the job that are in all honesty not that great. Hell I hate my job right now but I have rent to pay.

IMO this is unworkably optimistic.

&gt; How it would be paid is of course the big question and there's no really easy answer short of some layer of taxation.

This is the first question that should be answered before the idea is even suggested. Right now the only way it could work would be buy taxing income such that a company pays the first X thousand Â£ to the govt' which leads back into the first point.

null,false,hungoverseal,null,null,null,"Toys for girls tend to be round and pink, while toys for boy tend to be angular and blue. The subtle characteristics of toys may differentially appeal to the developing brains of female and male children.[6] In a study of toy preferences of twelve- to 24-month-old infants, males spent more time looking at cars than females and females spent more time looking at dolls than males. No preference for color was found.[7][8] Animal studies have lent further support for biologically determined gendered toy preferences. In a study of juvenile rhesus monkeys, when given the option between plush or wheeled toys, female monkeys gravitated toward plush toys, while male monkeys preferred toys with wheels. These findings suggest that gendered preferences for toys can occur without the socialization processes that we find in humans.[9] Female rhesus monkeys also tend to engage in more nurturing play activities, while males tend to engage in more rough-and-tumble play.
Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have atypically high blood concentrations of testosterone. In studies of toy preference, these girls show increased interest in male-typical toys, like trucks and balls. Overall, their play habits and preferences more closely resembled male-typical play than female-typical play. Even with children exposed a normal range of prenatal androgens, increased testosterone was associated with increased preference for male-typical toys, and decreased prenatal testosterone was associated with greater interest in female-typical toys.
Overall, the degree of androgen exposure during prenatal and postnatal development may bias males and females toward specific cognitive processes, which are further reinforced through processes of socialization. The male interest in balls and wheeled toys may relate to the androgenised brains preference for objects that move through space. The higher levels of androgens in the developing male brain could elicit greater attraction to cars and balls, while lower levels of androgens elicit a preference for dolls and nurturing activities in the female brain.[8]

So if preference for certain types of toy is largely influenced by testosterone, I'd happily through out a wild prediction that it plays a part in career choice as well.

The trouble is this kind of short-term patching up of the squad will just lead to the club constantly chasing its tail. Anyone that comes in looking like a sure thing on paper is unlikely to want to stick around in the event of relegation. Mutch never wowed me on the pitch, but at least he was under contract for a couple of years, young-ish and perhaps would've stuck around following a second relegation and an unspectacular season in W12. As it stands we only have Fer, Sandro and Taarabt under contract next year. One wants out and I'd be amazed if the club kept hold of the other two in the Championship. We'll be rebuilding once again in the summer, and it should be pretty clear by now that QPR is unlikely to survive at this level off the back of individual talent (no matter how hard Austin tries). We need a team to be more than the sum of its parts, and you will struggle to achieve that with a constant revolving door of players coming and going.

I do think that is a good point. Like he implies, that dissolves the dynamic into a sexist stereotype.  However, I don't see that as any different of the stereotype of the ""behind every successful man is a woman"" idea promoted more in new Who than classic Who (particularly Amy Pond, who I loved, but her being dominant over Rory is this stereotype in action). This reverse sexism can be seen if examined hard enough. Stereotypes tend to exist, whether we want them to or not. So really the question comes down to examining the role of the companion again and how this would work better, both with male Doctors (while I hated Clara initially, I love where the character has gone in the Capaldi era) and potential female Doctors. It also depends on the personality of the Doctor in the female incarnation. Some companion paradigms would work, some less.

I remember taking my GCSE maths exams (15 years old). Our school had a close to 50/50 split girls and boys, yet I think the top 5 maths students at that point were male (keep in mind this is a higher set). I think there was one girl in the top 10.

Going on to the next level this split became even bigger.

At this point it's fairly clear that it's going to be more men going into higher paying jobs. 

In my A-level physics class (step above GCSE, before University) we had 1 girl, who later dropped out. Meaning the **entire** class was male (around 25 students).

Given the high uptake of physics and maths students into high paying jobs (such as in banks) it's pretty clear this is where the discrepancy exists.

It's because Greece hasn't been making structural reforms to meet troika targets, but rather short cuts like tax increases and cutting services. 

The Greek state simply, hasn't reformed. 

As to credit and so on that you mentioned, Greece has some of the lowest, if not the lowest, household debt in the Eurozone. That's not the issue. The issue is that they haven't reformed their economy in the same way that Germany did when it was 'the sick man of Europe'. 

I sympathise with the Greek situation. But let's not delude ourselves, no one did this to Greece but the Greeks themselves, who didn't pay enough scrutiny to their politicians and allowed their society to reach its current stage.

So you're claiming he didn't rape her?

&gt; The court transcript says he left via a fire exit. Makes no mention as to whether it was open, locked, alarmed etc... I think by saying crept you're throwing your bias into it.

""After about half an hour McDonald left the hotel via the reception. He had a brief word with the night porter, telling him that he should look out for the girl in room 14 (the room in question) because she was sick. The applicant did not leave by the front door; he went out by an emergency exit. McDonald and the applicant met up outside and they returned to the applicant's home.""

So his mate leaves via the front door and in doing so encounters the night porter. Evans exits via the fire escape and isn't seen by the night porter he then immediately meets up with his mate and they both return to Evans home yet you'd have us believe that Evans didn't ""creep out""?

&gt; The independent expert brought in by the defence also said at the blood alcohol level he would expect her to be from what she described, he would not expect memory loss as the complainant described.

Here's some more extracts from the ruling:

""The CCTV footage showed that while she was inside the kebab shop she was unsteady on her feet, at one point she fell over and landed on the floor. On the other hand, outside the kebab shop she could be seen eating pizza from a large box, although she was also seen to stumble, squat, lose her balance, and walk unsteadily. Indeed, she left her handbag in the shop. Based on this evidence, the prosecution case was that she was very drunk.""

...

""The complainant had no recollection of anything which took place after 3am. That extended to the fact that she and McDonald entered the hotel at 4.15am. The night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"". That reinforced the Crown's case based on the evidence of witnesses and the CCTV footage before she had arrived at the hotel."" 


Also: 

""After about half an hour McDonald left the hotel via the reception. He had a brief word with the night porter, telling him that he should look out for the girl in room 14 (the room in question) because she was sick. The applicant did not leave by the front door; he went out by an emergency exit. McDonald and the applicant met up outside and they returned to the applicant's home.""

So Mr McDonald would also seem to think that the victim was very drunk.

""The complainant said that her next memory was waking up in the hotel room at about 11.30am. She realised that she was alone. She was naked and had urinated in the bed. She had a headache and was confused. She reported the matter to the police.""

So she's seen on video stumbling about and falling over, the night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"", Evans' mate asked the night porter to 'look out' for the victim because she was ""sick"".

To cap things off she wakes up ""confused"" having wet the bed and contacts the police, All that is rather suggestive that she was indeed very drunk. Yet you'd have us believe that this wasn't the case on nothing more that the testimony of an expert employed by the defence?

Expert testimony which is incidentally contradicted by another expert called by the defence:

""What the evidence does is to reinforce something denied by Dr Eccles: that the claim to loss of memory was not and could not be right. It suggests that, having consumed the amount of alcohol she had, the fact that her memory was lost of itself was of no great significance one way or anotherâ.

Multiple witnesses and video evidence suggest that the victim was very drunk, she woke up in her own urine and claims to have no memory of how she got into that bed. Yet you would seem to be suggesting that all the evidence that she was very drunk doesn't count and that she is lying about not having any memory of what happened to her on nothing more than expert testimony provided by the defence which is contradicted by other expert testimony also provided by the defence?",null,0,null,1422554152,null,0,false,0,co4tbqh,null,t3_2u2v4x,null,t1_co4tbqh,null,t1_co4riuo,null,null,null,1424322660,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I recall you as being an aoplogist for TTIP, we had a short exchange a few months ago and left it at that. I still don't agree with you on TTIP, as you might have guessed (even Zac Goldsmith disagrees with you!

POSTSCRIPT / EDIT TIME

OK, bit of a leap from TTIP apologist to non-humanitarian.

It is a difficult mid point, the issue of rape victims not coming forward is one that needs to be addressed, as does the concept of rape in general, but I think anonymity for suspects is, for the time being, a necessary safeguard to stop the pendulum swinging too far the other way.  I feel like the issue with a lot of people arises in the fact that they are not rapists, and find it hard to comprehend the prospect of how widespread it is. There's no one out there really arguing for how rape is ok, or how the blame should be put on the victim, or the counterpoint to all of the relevant issues that people are vocally trying to address. As a result, a lot of men who have never tried to rape someone, never seen it happen and are likely oblivious to just how much pressure is put on women (something I've been guilty of in the past, unfortunately - being oblivious, that is, not pressurising!!) and of course would never consider pressuring someone for sex - these people don't realise the extent of the problem and all they hear is people coming out calling for harsher sanctions on rapists, less benefit of the doubt for suspects, easier convictions, etc, and get scared that people are out there trying to convict rapists who, as far as they can see, are pretty non-existent. The only reasonable conclusion some people come to is it must be THEM who are in danger of being locked up. Which simply isn't the case.  There is a low conviction for rapists, which is partially because of victims being unwilling to come forward, but also largely because it's incredibly difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt that someone had no reasonable belief in consent. The legal system is really not as shoddy as people think.

While most of his traits might be ""neutral"" and it's hard to define or pin down any gender specific traits to begin with anyway without sounding sexist, he still always decidedly referred to himself as male, which means he identifies as such as well. 

Given that Timelords can change pretty easily, they'd probably have a specific term for one who is sort of 50/50 (or close to it), which seems to be the exception rather than the rule (if we look at all known regenerations in Doctor Who, only one has been seen on screen, and another in a throwaway reference has been about gender changing)

The Doctor has had plenty of identity crises, but gender had never to do with it. 

If you make him a woman you'd essentially need to give him that kind of identity crisis which is reallllyyyy bad. I already cringe at the thought of how that would play out.

If your 'defensive' assets aren't openly traded, you don't get to take advantage of this. Same deal with inflation - if inflation falls significantly below the 'normal' level of 2-3%, this tends to depress share prices, but boosts nominal bond prices. If inflation rises much above the normal level, share prices also generally drop in real terms but index linked bonds become more valuable. The overall effect of having a range of openly traded assets that people buy in response to bad news (which might also include precious metals and some currencies) is to reduce the net volatility of your portfolio.

However congratulations as you now have a concealed weapon - not actually true (unless the blade is sharp).

null,false,cRaziMan,null,null,null,"Here's your comprehensive night shift guide from someone who has to do a lot of night shifts and quickly alternate back and forth between nights and days:

- Before your first night shift make sure you've had lots of sleep in the days leading up to it (don't start night shifts with sleep debt) and then try to stay up most of the night just before work so you can sleep in the day.

- Get blackout blinds or wear eye blinds.

- I'd recommend silicone ear plugs (they're comfortable because they don't go into the ear and can be worn easily for long periods of time) they block out sound very effectively.

- Sleeping in the day is harder than sleeping at night and you'll need to optimise conditions to be able to sleep through. If heating normally comes on in your house during the day you'll have to adjust the timer because if it gets too hot in bed you'll wake up. Have an appropriate blanket/quilt to thermoregulate properly (this might take some trial and error to find how many layers you need to be comfortable depending on heating in the house and the weather).

- Some people are funny with meals when on night shifts and don't eat as much. The tummy gets uncomfortable at night (i think more wind builds up....a lot of people I work with feel a little nauseated overnight) and there's a shit ton of heartburn I get when eating meals at such odd times. But I'd recommend you stick with 3 proper meals a day.

- Fluid management is tricky. Drink lots of water overnight but cut back later so you don't have to wake up in the day to pee. Although you have to be careful (especially if it gets hot in your room during the day) since you could wake up really thirsty with a dry mouth. It's a difficult balance to strike.

- Treat the clock as if you're living a normal day except AM/PM are switched. Work for me starts at 9pm, so I'll wake up at 7pm and have breakfast. I'll have lunch at about 1am..... and so on.

- If you get really sleepy at night at work and get a chance to take a nap DO NOT sleep more than 20 minutes. You'll be too groggy waking up again and have trouble sleeping during the day.

- DO NOT get medication from your doctor to help you sleep unless you're really struggling and not getting any sleep. Once you get into a rhythm you can get used to flipping your clock and won't need to use medication (which can leave you feeling groggy when you wake up)

- Have your laundry/meals sorted. You don't want to have to worry about those chores when you get home exhausted (but that might just be me with longer work hours from 9pm to 10am.... might be easier for you with a 7 to 5 shift).

Hope all that helps. I'll add in more stuff if I can think of anything else.",null,0,null,1422555166,null,0,1422556750,0,co4txtx,null,t3_2u37ar,null,t1_co4txtx,null,t3_2u37ar,null,null,null,1424322374,null,17,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,17,null

When Balotelli is playing, I feel as though he gets close to Raheem kind of expecting a pass maybe but the pass usually doesn't arrive or when it does it's too late. Actually, this seems to happen with Coutinho and our other attack mids as well. I think because of that, it sometimes compounds an effect where, when Balotelli finally does get the ball, he may try to shoot rather than passing to Sterling because he gets fewer opportunities.

But the thing is that it meant I knew what sex was and where children came from before I understood why anyone would even want to do that sort of stuff.

My sex education at school was pretty none existent which is sad.  Most of us we are only here because our parents had sex so why should they be scared of us knowing what they did?

But porn just gives us unrealistic views of what sex is (or even what genitals should look like).

Porn means that men expect anal sex from their girl friends.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but would they have thought that's what they wanted before they were sold the idea?  To me it feels more of a fashion thing than an actual desire.  For what it's worth yes I have, but I'm old and have never been a great one for the porn so what do I know anyhow.

The Doctor hasn't used his genitals for anything in the past (let's keep it that way), so it shouldn't really matter what they are.

null,false,ninj3,null,null,null,"Here we go!

#####Music
Start with checking out the local [What's On](http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/whatson/index.html). That's the best place to see what is happening in the period of your visit. There is lots of music going on, but not every day, so you'll need to know where to go on which day. Two examples are [The Cellar](http://www.cellaroxford.co.uk/listings) for Rock/Indie/Funk/HipHop, pretty much all popular music, and the [Mad Hatter](http://www.themadhatteroxford.com/) which is a themed bar with some fancy drinks and Jazz every Tues night during term organised by the Uni JazzSoc.

#####Relax and Nature
Punting is a MUST in the summer! Two options: Magdalen bridge is the tourist favourite for its central location. However I find it too crowded and squashed. My favourite is [Cherwell boat house](http://www.cherwellboathouse.co.uk/) further North (but don't eat there, it's crazy expensive). Starting from the boat house, punt North away from the city, and about half an hour away, you'll find a lovely [river side pub](http://www.victoriaarms.co.uk/home) where you can park up and have a drink/some food/a picnic. I think they're ok with people eating their own food in their garden so long as you buy a drink or two (their food is average quality and price but it goes down really well after punting). After you're rested, head back or keep going, up to you. Bring some drinks and snacks to have in the boat too. Enjoy some Pimms on the river and really live it up. Nice use of an afternoon/day.

[Port meadow](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Port+Meadow/@51.771746,-1.285085,14z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sport+meadow!3m1!1s0x4876c4303b556f1f:0xe05f8b081a42329a) is a nice place to have a walk and picnic if the weather is good. There are two popular pubs in that area, [the Perch](http://www.the-perch.co.uk/) and [the Trout](http://www.thetroutoxford.co.uk/home/). Both are in lovely locations, but I find the Trout way overpriced for food. I have not eaten at the Perch.

The [Botanical Gardens](http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/) aren't just a pretty place. They actually have examples of almost every plant known to man that contributes in some way to humanity. It is not free to enter, but I have always enjoyed it. To make best use of it, don't just walk around, get your hands on the [audio](http://www.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/botanic-garden-audio-trail) [guides](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/botanic-garden-chemistry-audio-tour) at the very least to make it interesting and learn something.

#####Architecture
Having the world's oldest university, Oxford has architecture in spades. There are too many colleges to list here. If you're interested in seeing inside them, you can during most days. Some charge (the popular and mean ones), some don't.

#####Museums
Most British museums are free to enter, you only need to pay for special exhibitions, so feel free to just wonder in and see if they tickle your fancy. I like the [Museum of Natural History](http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/) because dinosaurs and the [Pitt Rivers](http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/) because guns, weapons and shrunken heads. Conveniently these two are directly connected to each other! In fact, you go through the MNH to get to the Pitt Rivers. There is also the [Ashmolean](http://www.ashmolean.org/) for Art and Archaeology.

#####Food
If it's ""local"" food you want, Oxford is covered in many pubs with big names and historical reputations. Some that I've been to where the food is decent are King's Arms, Turf Tavern, Chequers, Eagle and Child (Tolkein's favourite I think) and the Duke of Cambridge. As for American breakfast, sorry, I don't know what that entails and I don't go out for breakfast. [Maxwells](http://www.maxwells.co.uk/food.php) advertises as American style but I can't say whether it's really American or not.

Oxford has two nice markets that may be worth checking out. The permanent [covered market](http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/) is open every day during the day-time and has fresh meat and veg and some famous stores selling [pies](http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/cafes-and-restaurants4-2/), [milkshakes](http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/moo-moos-2/) and [cookies](http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/bens-cookies/) that are very popular with locals, students and tourists alike. Second is the [gloucester green market](http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decLP/GloucesterGreenMarket.htm) which is only open Weds, Thurs and Sat during the day. Lots of food and goods on offer here for great prices. Of note are the dumpling sellers, with various styles from China, Japan and Nepal (I like them all!). For grocery shopping, you can go to the local Tesco (Magdalen St) or Sainsburys (Westgate Centre).

#####18-25 hangouts
Haha well, usually this always involves some sort of drinking establishment, be it a pub, club, cocktail bar, college bar or whatever. Unfortunately, that's kind of what British people do. But don't fret! A pub isn't just a place for people to get drunk! Treat it more like a cafe. You don't have to drink alcoholic beverages and no one will care if you don't. It's just a place to sit and chat where it's warm and sheltered from rain. I am personally not a fan of clubs and bars, so I can't tell you much about those.

#####In conclusion
Well that is by no means an exhaustive list of Oxford attractions, but hopefully it will give you some idea of things to do while you are here. I hope it is helpful and I hope you enjoy your visit!",null,0,null,1422555892,null,0,false,0,co4udxm,null,t3_2u19zc,null,t1_co4udxm,null,t1_co4n4aw,null,null,null,1424322165,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Section 28 was in effect until 2003 anyway so secular schools were no different and mostly still the same, I can't believe they never told me why I'm so much more risk of HIV and basically just left us in the dark. What were they thinking? No wonder HIV infections are still bad when nobody knows anything about it or talks about it. If I don't know *why* I am more likely to get HIV how can I protect myself from it? 

Stuff like evolutionary psychology, kin selection and more advanced subjects like that really helped me and nobody knows anything about it. I remember in biology lesson we had some shitty old textbooks that basically said ""all purpose of life is to reproduce"" and it fucked me up by proxy. How could it not? Nothing on k-selecting species or r-selecting species or anything. It was life changing when I studied these things and it could be done so easily, even just an hour or two of study was life changing for me. 

Even to this day, stonewall or pinknews or someone like that found out most schools still operate under section 28 style curriculum and don't know what they're actually allowed to talk about 

People are like ""oh the parents should be the ones to teach about it"" but they know even less than the kids do about it and just fill their heads with prejudiced nonsense and recycled myths from the 1940s. I'm so annoyed by the whole thing.

R v Bree (I think that's the right case. If I remember, I'll check when I get home.) covers exactly that.

A man and woman met up and spent time together both getting drunk. They have sex and there's an accusation of rape.

Consent was a big deal to that case. They were both drunk and it was a drunken consent argument as opposed to a rape by consent thing.

It resulted in a conviction, on the drunken consent doesn't count argument. R v Bree is the appeal and the appellant was acquitted. Interestingly, this was mainly because the conviction was considered unsound, due to the way the judge directed the jury.

It's important to appreciate though that although the guy was initially convicted (which is a legitimately terrifying prospect) the decision in the appeal became a key point on the issue of consent and the mind of the accused. It's very much **not**, ""She was drunk, therefore it was rape.""

Where the lack of consent is not clear a reasonable expectation that consent existed and hadn't been withdrawn is relevant. It was before this change to the guidance. The police should have been considering it already, but the suggestion, ""The accused will have to show the Fucking Consent Form was properly signed and notarised!"" is kind of scare bait.",null,0,null,1422556252,null,0,false,0,co4ulsl,null,t3_2u0kii,null,t1_co4ulsl,null,t1_co43azb,null,null,null,1424322063,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Fortunately, we're nowhere near that stage that they would have to leave the EU, nor do I think we would be getting there in the foreseeable future. It's not a matter of ""Greece wants to end austerity, Germany says no"". Rather, it's a matter of ""Greece wants to break some agreements it made (issuing bonds), who is going to fund them when international creditors refuse to touch them with a ten foot pole? Why should the Germans continue funding them, when Germany (and hence, the 80 million Germans) all had money essentially stolen from them by Greece, because Greece fucked up?"".

&gt;I recall you as being an aoplogist for TTIP

That's unfortunate. I have never been an apologist for TTIP. Rather, as someone that has pumped *literally* thousands of hours into studying trade agreements and negotiation, I'd say I have the academic backing to refute most of the crappy arguments used against TTIP. I'm not for the agreement, or against - I'm waiting for the details of it to actually be released before I pass judgement. Because, honestly, there is a *horrific* amount of FUD being targeted towards TTIP as I most recently outlined [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/2tz5yg/natalie_bennett_leader_of_the_green_party_will_be/co45o0o).

&gt;willingness to blame innocent people for being thrust into a poor financial situation because of dodgy politicos and businessmen

Greek civil society was responsible for keeping the government abuses and excesses in check. They live in a democracy, they have certain responsibilities. You can't just say ""well, we voted for them and they formed government, but we're not responsible for what they do after that"". They should have been more vigilant and more responsible with who they chose, their media (both corporate, and independent journalists) should've been educating their citizens about where they were heading, and they should have taken more democratic action - whether protests, or writing letters, or what have you. Instead, they were complacent, and that got them where they are now. It's shitty what's happening to them, but I don't see why others should be harmed because of their political apathy, and one of the things they'll learn with democracy is that it has consequences. It's reductive in the extreme to just blame 'politicos and businessmen'. As a sidenote, it's interesting that all the countries that left military dictatorships around the 70s (Greece, Spain, Portugal), are all experiencing similar problems - large leftist-populist parties gaining power, after decades of political apathy.

&gt;I have to say that your humanitarianism is rather lacking

This is rather amusing to me, given I've been doxxed by the neonazi sub /r/european and have regular [hate](http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/2ojy3k/reurope_is_starting_to_get_it_too/cmnu66y) threads [created](http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/2n9hxc/anyone_here_cause_they_got_banned_from_reurope/cmbmfal) against me for daring to defend refugee rights, arguing with their users against tarring all immigrants and muslims with the same brush, and the like. But as you say in your edit, yes, it is quite a leap.

&gt; I guess my view on this is the thought of a ""trade agreement"" that (in the words of Private Eye) ""will allow multinationals to use unaccountable international tribunals to sue national governments if the latter impose regulations that the corporations don't like."" That, to me, suggests very strongly indeed that the agreement will benefit certain groups of people. I'm willing to bet that most of us are not included in those groups.

That's because most people have a very skewed and ignorant understanding of ISDS. I made a post on a submission in /r/truereddit [a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/tb/2t33l7) trying to disabuse people of most of the false information floating around ISDS, to some degree of success. I suggest you read it, perhaps it'll change your mind. The discussion following contains quite a bit of information particularly relevant to TTIP as well. Furthermore, ISDS is part of over 1400 agreements involving European countries (many of which involve the UK). The UK has never lost an ISDS case, nor even been sued. It's not some kind of evil new thing, it's standard and has been around for decades.

In all seriousness I can imagine a small house costing around Â£300 per month on all bills total.

We spend around Â£200 in our 2 bed flat (it's pretty spacious though).

Again lots of factors to consider such as local council tax, age of the house (heating bills) and how lavish you want your television/internet package.

TV licence is Â£145.50 for the year  if you pay it all up front. Phone line rental is around Â£12 to Â£16 per month depending on who you go with (again cheaper if paid off up front). You can add about Â£10 onto the cost of that and there's your broadband. Another 5 to Â£10 more and you can get fibre.

You can expect home insurance to weigh in at around Â£100-Â£150 per year but obviously that's assuming you don't have any works of art or 70inch 8K televisions you feel particularly insecure about.

A phone contract can be had for around Â£10 a month for lots of minutes, texts and internet if you dont buy a phone with it. If you want the latest iPhone and all those minutes/texts/data then you can expect to pay up to Â£50 per month.

I mean, we're seriously discussing that just the act of a man correcting a woman would be a bad thing. Culture as a whole was way off-balance decades ago, and feminism (the extreme form that seems to be preached here) has managed to tip the scale all the way over to the other side for some people.

We're all humans, and we're all imperfect. We all make stupid mistakes and need to be corrected, or at least nudged in the right direction. In my mind, that's the point of the companion... sure, the companion gives us a frame of reference so that we can better relate to a time lord, but beyond that, I think the fact that the Doctor ALWAYS looks for a companion shows that he knows he isn't perfect. He is looking for a complement that will balance him out when he goes wibbly.

I don't really have an opinion on whether the Doctor should be female at some point. I think it could be interesting, in the same way that some people think Lucy Liu makes a good Watson. It's a twist that can open up new and unexpected story lines. That said, I think it would be an absolute tragedy if the writers decided to make a female doctor that was suddenly head-strong and infallible with a male companion that is wrong all the time and needs her to correct him. Basically, Amy Pond, as you said. The Doctor is exciting and all, but he/she will make mistakes, and the companion needs to be strong enough to speak his/her mind.

If the story can't work without putting in a bunch of CYA's to make the feminists happy, it shouldn't be done at all.

This is exactly what I'm talking about when I say you're arguing from ideology.

Yes it is.  CAR and Kenya both have high rates of post-14 year old FGM.  But really my point was that FGM was often conducted when the victim was aware of it, and could remember it.  Half the African nations have a greater percentage of FGM mutilations between 5 and 15+ than of 0 to 5.

I have an issue with large multi nationals that have no such fairness or equality, who happily exploit workers and drive down wages by crushing competition at the request of share holders who's only care is building as much wealth as possible at everyone else's expense.

He was competent in the opening stages in the League Cup and the FA Cup in 2011/12 but didn't feature in the more ""important"" games and I think that was for a reason. 

He scored goals in patches and I think that has clouded his contribution to the team. The goals he often scored was often in a time in the season when there wasn't expectation (this happened in 2011 and 2012). 

I was at a toss up with Masch and Studge... I gave Studge the edge because I don't think we anticipated him to be as good as he has been. Don't get me wrong, I thought he would be a fine striker. Just not a record-breaking one, especially with Liverpool's history of record-breaking strikers.

Of the films that are apparently jobs, 4/9 aren't even roles in feature films but roles in student films and short films.

[See this article](https://wealth.barclays.com/en_gb/smartinvestor/better-investor/investing-lessons-from-114-years-of-data.html). The yield from bonds is more consistent, i.e. it rides out recessions better than most stocks. In the years 2000-2010 bonds and gilts out performed equities. Switch that to 2004-2014 and its a different story, equities are starting to make ground. 

Over specific 10 year periods equities have a better chance of outperforming bonds. This is important when taking into consideration the investment time frame. Nobody has a magic ball to say when equities will suddenly increase in value, so you can't just sit waiting for the right time to jump ship, get there early etc. Of course you want a spread investment portfolio anyway! 

Also are you aware due to the recent success of bonds, their gross redemption yield is actually decreasing? More people want to jump ship just like you, are willing to buy at a higher price = lower returns.

This was all corroborated by Clayton.

Are you taking the piss? you have argued with me, while I have shown you sources that back up my information and you spew random numbers from the aether, your ""high horse"" is you stating arguments without evidence and being angered when I correct them. I am instantly sceptical of any source that claims 

&gt;""in Guinea, all Fulani women that were surveyed said they were victims.""

and then you don't give me the survey, especially when you find all these statistics that I cannot, so you obviously have them to hand, and yet don't actually cite them.

this becomes a larger problem for me when you have posted things that I have provided sources to prove false. eg.

&gt;The WHO says that while FGM can be a minor operation, these cases are rare. It is much more common to remove labia and restrict the vaginal opening.

False that is the rarest type.

&gt;type II being prevalent in south Nigeria and type III in the north.

False Type III is not prevalent in any part of Nigeria

And then you argue points I don't make.

&gt;You; Plenty of African nations have a higher rate of FGM post-14 years old than pre-14 years old.

&gt; me; the only culture that have a history of such practice are Ethnic Somali

&gt;. you; Along ethnic lines, ethnicities like the Fulani and Hedareb practice type II and type III FGM

Without ideology you'll never understand just why the Conservatives do what they do and why Labour oppose it for instance. It's a clash of differing ideals, differing mindsets and different approaches to what they consider the best way to live.

It will be a great day when this role reversal can play out without anyone batting an eyelid. The current trend of impossibly perfect female characters is a reaction to a time (depressingly recently) when women were generally cast as eye candy often with little personal agency. In Doctor Who this happened with the character of Susan. The actress was told she'd be adventurous but when it came to it she ended up screaming to grandfather for help most of the time.  

We're in a slightly precarious position where most people are quite accepting that women have the potential to possess the full spectrum of character traits and abilities. But it wasn't that long ago that this wasn't the general opinion AT ALL and some of that thinking remains! That's why it's still so taboo for some female characters in non-stereotypical roles to show fallibility - the vulnerability to attack still feels too high.

I don't see laziness or lack of desire; i see hesitancy and doubt. He doesn't know how, who and when to close down. He doesn't know where and when he should be, if he should be running into the box, or staying deep to offer himself as an option.

The solution is really a mix of 1. Rodgers communicating his expectations to Balotelli, and 2. Balo gaining the confidence to make his own decisions on how he should move to best benefit us 3. the team learning to adapt to Balotelli.

Under Rodgers, our strikers have always been the 'advanced forward' type - making runs behind the defence, running at the defence, having the confidence to attack defenders by themselves. Balo's playstye is much more like a deep-lying forward - he is used to coming deep to receive the ball and play other players in, and requires players running ahead of him for him to play in.

For Balo to succeed here, he must adapt to liverpool, but he cannot do it by himself.

It ignores a very important part of politics, which is that there's more to it than policies. You need a great deal of other information which aids you to decide whether or not you actually *believe* the politicians who say they will do it.

For example, I might support an elected House of Lords (I don't, but imagine I did), but should that factor into my decision to vote Labour? Probably not, because the House of Lords is one of those things Labour like to pretend they'll do anything about. But it might factor into my decision to vote for the Green party, because they'd be more likely to actually do it.

It's also important to know more about these policies. For example, if I support a basic income at first, I might tell Vote for Policies that I do. But reading about how unaffordable it is, and how it would probably mean getting rid of something I like more (for example, if I support Trident), I might not want to vote Green any more because of *priorities*.

null,false,8run0,null,null,null,"ALTHOUGH academically selective, state-funded grammar schools were purged from most of mainland Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, they clung on in Ulster. And with good reason. Many are wonderful, and the Catholic ones in particular have been a route to the upper middle class for many clever children from that historically downtrodden group.

Yet these schools are also part of an education system that remains starkly divided on confessional lines. More than 90% of Northern Irish children attend schools that are mainly Catholic or mainly Protestant. At Lumen Christi in Derry, one of the best Catholic grammar schools, all pupils are encouraged to study religious education up to age 15, learning, for example, the history of clerical vestments.

Almost all outside observers of Northern Ireland see this unofficial segregation as a factor in prolonging sectarian antagonism. With tough budget cuts looming, the duplication caused by sectarianism looks harder to justify, and most public figures inside the province agree in theory that Catholic and Protestant youngsters should do more learning together. But the status quo has powerful defenders, on both sides of the sectarian divide.

Campaigners for integrated education complain of a wall of opposition from two main quarters. The first is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), for which most Protestants vote. Peter Robinson, the first minister and leader of the DUP, has spoken in favour of integrated education. But his party has little to gain from a melting away of sectarian division.

The second opponent, unsurprisingly, is the Catholic church. It has fought a skilful defensive campaign, standing firm on religion while also arguing that the Catholic grammar schools should be open to all Catholic pupils, not just the brightest. To some, it seems that the church is stressing equality among Catholics as a subtle way to preserve religious separation. A few schools have bent under this pressure and dropped their academic entrance tests. Others, like Lumen Christi, are resisting. On January 25th Archbishop Eamon Martin made a fresh plea to end selection.

In this, the Catholic church is oddly allied with Sinn Fein, the political voice of Irish republicanism. That party is anti-clerical at heart, and clashes with the church over gay marriage and abortion, yet it is also socialist. And so church and party are as one on the desirability of all-ability schools, although neither is in any hurry to see mixed-religion schools.

With one qualification. John OâDowd, the Sinn Fein education minister, has overridden his civil servantsâ advice and earmarked funds for a new Irish-language secondary school. In theory, most of these Irish-medium schools are non-religious and open to all, thus ticking the secular box. Yet out of the 5,000 or so Northern Irish pupils who attend them, only about 40 are from Protestant homes. They are hardly engines of integration.",null,0,null,1422561943,null,0,false,0,co4y3u3,null,t3_2u3hx0,null,t1_co4y3u3,null,t1_co4xl2b,null,null,null,1424320383,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

Religious schools will endure in Ulster. Academic selection may not
Jan 31st 2015**

ALTHOUGH academically selective, state-funded grammar schools were purged from most of mainland Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, they clung on in Ulster. And with good reason. Many are wonderful, and the Catholic ones in particular have been a route to the upper middle class for many clever children from that historically downtrodden group.

Yet these schools are also part of an education system that remains starkly divided on confessional lines. More than 90% of Northern Irish children attend schools that are mainly Catholic or mainly Protestant. At Lumen Christi in Derry, one of the best Catholic grammar schools, all pupils are encouraged to study religious education up to age 15, learning, for example, the history of clerical vestments.

Almost all outside observers of Northern Ireland see this unofficial segregation as a factor in prolonging sectarian antagonism. With tough budget cuts looming, the duplication caused by sectarianism looks harder to justify, and most public figures inside the province agree in theory that Catholic and Protestant youngsters should do more learning together. But the status quo has powerful defenders, on both sides of the sectarian divide.

Campaigners for integrated education complain of a wall of opposition from two main quarters. The first is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), for which most Protestants vote. Peter Robinson, the first minister and leader of the DUP, has spoken in favour of integrated education. But his party has little to gain from a melting away of sectarian division.

The second opponent, unsurprisingly, is the Catholic church. It has fought a skilful defensive campaign, standing firm on religion while also arguing that the Catholic grammar schools should be open to all Catholic pupils, not just the brightest. To some, it seems that the church is stressing equality among Catholics as a subtle way to preserve religious separation. A few schools have bent under this pressure and dropped their academic entrance tests. Others, like Lumen Christi, are resisting. On January 25th Archbishop Eamon Martin made a fresh plea to end selection.

In this, the Catholic church is oddly allied with Sinn Fein, the political voice of Irish republicanism. That party is anti-clerical at heart, and clashes with the church over gay marriage and abortion, yet it is also socialist. And so church and party are as one on the desirability of all-ability schools, although neither is in any hurry to see mixed-religion schools.

With one qualification. John OâDowd, the Sinn Fein education minister, has overridden his civil servantsâ advice and earmarked funds for a new Irish-language secondary school. In theory, most of these Irish-medium schools are non-religious and open to all, thus ticking the secular box. Yet out of the 5,000 or so Northern Irish pupils who attend them, only about 40 are from Protestant homes. They are hardly engines of integration.

The big issue is taht there's 4 mega clubs (utd, Chelsea, City, Arsenal) + Liverpool, Spurs, Everton and Southampton also going for it. When one of those 4 teams slip up there's a huge group already aiming for that position.

We're not good enough to do that currently. 

The idea is that when we get the OS it should eventually double our matchday income. There's maybe 50% more seats which should add about 30-40% more revenue, though they will definitely charge less in some areas of the stadium. The nice part is that our corporate sponsorship should go up huge amounts. The new stadium has box seats basically add a whole new section to the stadium. Those catered seats probably cost like 10-30k a season and if there are 20 of them it'll end up adding a nice bit of money to our coffers. 

Increasing our income slightly will hopefully help the team on the field and result in being able to separate ourselves from the other midtable teams and into that Liverpool tier.

I don't see what medical conditions have to do with this discussion. If you are medically handicapped than obviously you may not be able to achieve in the same way of non handicapped students, but I think that goes without saying.

What we are discussing are students who have the same potential, which is essentially everyone other than those who are mentally handicapped.

Under Welfare
In the longer run a fundamental reform is needed, where most of the complicated benefits, means tests and qualifying contributions are swept away, and all citizens receive as of right a basic income â a Citizenâs Income. The cost of this would be recovered through a more progressive income tax system.

Must be said that the details are still being looked at so not set in stone also the Lib dems supported a policy like that until 1996.  Given how complex the current system is along with how much we spend on a limited group maybe adding a big net so more people can work even if it part time.  Â£72 is currently compensate for being too old to work costs us around Â£100 billion a year. 

Brighton most of choices from the past leaders forced the greens to make hard choices they can't buy out of deals with 30 year contracts. 

Does the UK need a massive army given that Russia is no longer a threat or france? 
Also what happened to innocent until proven guilty when it came to crime or did that disappear? 
Currently the UK brings in around Â£100 billion a year in income tax with Â£27 billion on council tax.  Tax gap is meant to be around Â£30 billion to Â£100 billion.  Given how high inequality is something tells me small gap in what people should be paying.  UK property worth something like Â£1 trillion pounds and we only get small couple of billion back.  

Worth noting the greens want to use QEing on building investments projects not sending the money to banks which are not lending money to business.  Also want to increase investment spending something which would help the UK grow. 

Greens want growth they just want balance growth that everybody gains from so your income increases at 2% with the top 1% having a 5% increase in income.  Right now the top 1% is having a 10% OR more increase with bottom 1% having 0.1% increase.   Green party long term goal is everybody working less hours getting a better wage with less inequality and a strong social net.   

Must be noted that high inequality leads to lower growth and stagnation history shows us this.  Also a study or two showing home ownership also does the same.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Smaller projects are more complex and difficult to connect for various reasons. This is the reason that the grid is designed with a few big power stations connected together at high voltage, with individual towns and cities taking power off that high voltage grid.

Connecting small generators to low voltage grids is tricky, because you have to avoid, at all costs, allowing the generators keep powering the local area if the main grid connection drops out. The technical term is formation of an ""island"".

In fact, this has become a lot more difficult in recent years, because of the destabilising effect of wind and PV. The normal way of detecting island formation, is detection of grid frequency instability.

Normal generators are ""synchronous"": the turbines are magnetically locked to the grid frequency and all turn together at the same relative angle and speed. The inertia of all these rotating machines acts to smooth out the frequency, and the kinetic energy provides a temporary energy store of a few seconds, allowing control systems to act. Wind and PV are inverter based, and provide no inertia or kinetic energy reserve to the grid. A small grid ""island"" has less inertia and so has more variability. But replacing turbines with inverters also reduces inertia.

This has become a significant problem, as the frequency of the national grid has become so unstable, that it has started tripping off the island protection in generators (which actually makes the stability problem worse) - and national grid have had to issue new anti-island guidelines after a serious incident a couple of years ago, where the grid nearly collapsed because anti-islanding started tripping out small generators after a big power station went off line causing frequency to dip temporarily.

It's even more of a problem in Ireland, because their grid is much smaller anyway. In Ireland, wind farms are required to only operate at 90% of the prevailing wind conditions, so that if there is temporary grid imbalance they can temporarily ramp up to 100% to support the grid. 

The most effective solution will come from lots of medium sized wind farms, widely connected. It's likely that all planned capacity can be accommodated, but there may be difficulties accomodating more than 25% wind power for prolonged periods on an isolated grid - the UK is not like Denmark which connects into the West European continent wide grid, which is very strong.",null,0,null,1422564589,null,0,1422565420,0,co4zpaq,null,t3_2u361d,null,t1_co4zpaq,null,t1_co4xzv0,null,null,null,1424319638,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Sure, does the team revolve around pressing high? Yes so he will be obligated to do so. But that's not why Rodgers hasn't been playing him. The truth is that no forward in the world would have done well with the way we were playing the first half of the season. We played with a long striker, our midfield was pathetic, and our forwards had zero support. Rodgers is 100% to blame for the lack of productivity from our strikers. Borini, Lambert, and Balo could all have 8-10 goals by now if we had a better structure in the middle. Rodgers took MONTHS to get Gerrard out of playing DM. It took him MONTHS to stop putting Hendo out wide. It took him MONTHS to put Lucas where he should be playing. And now he's on some Sterling as a CF kick. He's been mad all year. 

You're deeming Balo lazy on what basis? In what game exactly has he been lazy? THe hate for him is ridiculous. His 'high pressing' crap is nonsense. Rodgers new very well how Balo played before he bought him. He needs a link up striker to perform well, something he did at City, Milan, and Inter. It's very simple, he is NOT a lone CF and never will be. He's nto a in the box striker. 

The real reason we have sucked this year is Rodgers. That's a fact that cannot be denied. I am not on a Rodgers Out rant at all, I want him to stay. But he has been quite awful all year.

With Blofeld dead, Connery's Bond retires. But in San Monique, 3 MI6 agents are killed. This prompts M to recruit another agent to fill the name James Bond, Moore's Bond.All agents who take the position of a 00 agent are told of their predecessors histories.

I think we have different definitions of that phrase. Half of those names aren't ""markedly better"", at least not consistently anyway (which I did state originally). But never mind that. You clearly disagree with the notion that Guzan is among the better keepers in the league. Fair enough.

Doesn't really matter, since your overall point doesn't really stand up either. You're underrating the squad, if anything.

It's not really a matter of whether we'd retain players. Few clubs would make a serious bid for Benteke despite his obvious quality, because they can't afford him, for example. How many players are Swansea concerned about retaining right now? Probably not many. Doesn't mean they don't have a decent squad.

A better test is ""how many teams in this division would each of these players improve?"" Of our best eleven, I think you're hard pressed to argue the majority wouldn't improve seven or eight (or more) teams in the division.

Some of your criticisms are justified, and we don't have great depth, but that doesn't mean we have a ""weak"" squad. You can make similar arguments about Man Utd if you wanted to. Outside their first eleven, they're lacking desperately. Similarly Arsenal. I don't hear people expecting them to plummet to mid-table obscurity, though.

I dunno man, I'm all for realistic expectations and stuff, but you're talking like we're Championship level, when we have a mid-table PL first eleven and enough depth to survive at least. Barring catastrophically bad luck, we're alright. Nowhere near where we should be, but alright.",null,0,null,1422564962,null,0,false,0,co4zx75,null,t3_2tyvzd,null,t1_co4zx75,null,t1_co4lyl8,null,null,null,1424319535,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

And British TV is just not like that, which makes it extremely charming to me. The shows that I like are never Pretty TV. Doctor Who is fabulous fucking TV, but fitting beautiful American actors and actresses into all the parts just makes me sad. I don't always want Pretty TV and when I do there's about a million different offerings from my side of the pond. 

Now, I don't mean to say that there are no attractive people on British shows because Lord Almighty, that's not true. I just mean that most of the time the shows are less concerned with being slick and attractive and more concerned with little things like, oh, character development. 

Edit: Also, BBC goes to some dark and creepy places in shows. They don't always have happy endings. And I like that, because life doesn't have happy endings sometimes.

null,false,Monztaa,lfcwfmm,,null,"I never said Balotelli was a poor striker because he does't press. Balotelli is, for example, a perfect striker for Mourinho because his philosophy involves dropping deep as soon as you lose the ball, which Balotelli has been accustomed to doing since he was a teenager, I suspect. Balotelli never has been part of a pressing team and that's a fact as Rafa would say. 

Rodgers categorically, and quite correctly said, if you can't press you will not play. You can read it here: (http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30971115)

So yes, that's why Balotelli hasn't been playing. Ironically if Balotelli did learn to press as well as Sturridge, we would've achieved a lot more points since he is one of the few natural finishes in the squad. 

Rodgers is to blame for the lack of productivity from our strikers? Really? I bet if you gave Rodgers free reign at the start of last summer's transfer window, the squad would be much different then what it is now. Speed and mobility are 2 key principles of Rodgers' game. And that's exactly what Balotelli opposes. So how is it Rodgers' fault that he ended up with Balotelli? If a junior like myself can see that Balotelli wouldn't fit us, then of course Rodgers would see it. Do you honestly believe Rodgers wanted Balotelli? Because I am telling you now it's a fact that Balotelli is everything against a Rodgers typical player.

You clearly don't understand Rodgers' principle of play if you think 'high pressing crap' is nonsense. As mentioned before, Balotelli's mobility and pressing couldn't be further away from the ideal Rodgers player. Football is a bit more complex than 'he needs a link up striker'. No, it's not very simple at all. 

Ironic how a person who has never made a single substitution in a game is questioning Rodgers' thinking and tactical nous. You don't fully appreciate Rodgers at all and what he has done to us. 

Pressing, mobility and speed has been the thesis thus far of Rodgers' rein here. Now you tell me, have you ever acquainted Balotelli with those three words?

And it *is* basically canon that the doctor's thoughts influence his regenerations. As the war doctor, he thinks about the ears before regenerating into the Ninth Doctor. As the 11th doctor, he feels like an old man, and he thinks about Amy and regenerates as an ""old (Capaldi's only 56)"" man with Amy's Scottish accent.

I think that between an older and female Master, and River Song being partly Timelord, the show is doing it's best to represent all ages, sexualities(Captain Jack's lack of qualms), and genders among the Timelord/Companion community.

I'm not trying to say the show is perfect, but it does *try* to include everyone. There's cheap, dirty jokes sometimes, but there are plenty of strong, prevalent females on the show.

Honestly Clara is a bit of an empty pot in terms of character, but think about Harriet Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, River Song, Martha Jones (A doctor herself, and strong enough to leave the Doctor when sensing an unhealthy relationship, no less!).

And I feel like Arthur Darvill, who has some SERIOUS acting chops, played the comedic love interest beautifully, growing a tiny bit bolder with each episode, incrementally, til you get to Series 7 and he's doing great and then, suddenly, we're saying goodbye to him. 

I didn't like Rory the first few episodes. But he grew. And upon my rewatching, I cast him as a lead instead of a side character, and paid more attention to him than I gave to Amy, and then I dedicated a rewatch of all the River episodes, and I just...I love them all, but Rory the best. 

I feel that Donna is divisive because she's a comedienne. I hated her at first, but love her now and definitely identify with her character arc. I think she has a very sad ending, one of the saddest.

This didn't matter, as part of the reason for building the magnox plants was because they produced good quality plutonium for the manufacture of weapons. The fact that the used fuel was unstable and had to be liquified for processing didn't matter.

It did matter after the cold war, because the fuel couldn't simply be stored or disposed of - it had to be liquified in acid, and re-processed - with all extreme cost and the nasty acid, liquid radioactive residues that were produced as by products.

IF seeing women as people who run around and kiss everything and have no control over their own reproduction is not seeing them as inherently less than men, and not expressing hate, what would be?  

As for the first set, I understand them, and absolutely agree a female Doctor would be a risk for those reasons.  Just as any change would be a risk.  And that's why I'm in the group who would want the doctor to be female because they had the perfect actor for the role who is a woman, rather than doing it for the sake of doing it, ending up with a half arsed job that no one would like.  

A relevant example, I think, would be Peter Capaldi.  He was a risk.  He's the oldest actor to play the Doctor since the classic series, with a much stronger and less friendly personality.  There was a fear that no one would be receptive to him, but he was the best person for the role, and has proven to be a great Doctor since he started.  And I think the preparation the Production crew did to prepare everyone for him helped-spending more time than previously on scripts, characterisation, organising a world tour so fans could meet the actor before they met him as the Doctor-it was all preparation, and it paid off brilliantly.  For a similarly large change (Not just gender either-if Capaldi stays around for as long as Tom Baker, whoever replaces him would need to have similar amount of preparation to avoid backlash) if the same time is taken, I feel it would still be a great success.

null,false,TheConnivingPedant,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; A BBC news cameraman called Phil Goodwin came to me and told me that the BBC offices in major cities have kept all their recorded footage in cupboards and store rooms. There are hundreds of tapes of what are called rushes â the original, unedited material from which news reports are created. And they were just lying there.

&gt;To prove this, Phil went to Kabul and spent weeks digitising the rushes. He brought them back to London and no one wanted them. But I was very interested, so he gave them to me. 

&gt;The way [journalists] tell stories about the world feels increasingly thin â and more and more detached from the way all of us think and feel. Journalism used to open up reality to tell us new stuff. But now it is helping to keep us all inside the bubble by playing back stuff we already know in slightly altered forms.

&gt;So I've taken all that unedited material from Afghanistan and tried to use it in a new way. My aim is both to show the complex reality that we didn't see in Afghanistan, but also to try and do it in a way that's more emotional and involving. Some of it is quite radical, but I think you have to try and do that if you want to puncture the bubble. 

&gt;the people in the rushes I have used are doing something very different. They are really brave journalists and technical people going into an incredibly complex situation and trying to make sense of it. And, in a way, they are the heroes of my film.

I believe the concept of the site is fundamentally flawed. You can't answer some questions on a website and be told what party to vote for - it just can't be done. Yes it's subjective - politics is subjective.

You don't need to read the manifestos - manifestos are for the press to read, digest and find what's most interesting and call the parties out on, so that they have a single, unified platform they're all expected to defend. They also exist for politicians to be able to cite, to give some weight to what they're saying; to say ""the party has agreed to this - it's not just me and it's not just the leader"".

I didn't read any. I didn't need to. I followed the news, listened to what parties had to say about themselves and each other - applied what I'd seen from what they said and (in the case of the Government), what they actually did. Evaluated how trustworthy everybody seemed to be and thought about how likely things were to come about. This fundamentally cannot be done on a website, and it's dishonest to pretend it can. 

It oversimplifies things to the point that it trivializes a very important decision, and gives you the wrong tools to make it, while pretending to be just the right tool. I think this is damaging.

Not that that's Rodgers fault, but don't blame the board here. Failed to sign William and a few others within the last 18 mos as well.. He has had full backing from our board. 

Yes I do honestly feel Rodgers wanted Balo. We NEEDED another striker, and Balo was talent for talent the best one available. He cut off Remy last minute bc Balo became available. You honestly think the board is the one who forced Balo onto Rodgers? Come on mate.. What about Lambert?...

And clearly I do understand Rodgers principle of play. He came out publicly with this 'high pressure' crap just last month. It was never brought in any of his tenure with us or with any other team. It's an excuse to push Balo to work harder for the team. This isn't about ""high pressure or you're out!"". He's using the media to push Balo. Just like he did with Mignolet. Balo definitely needs to high press, but that's not what his football should be based on, and anyone other than diluted Mario haters know this. He's a striker for goodness sakes. The media are simply running with it bc they're a bunch of turds. I highly doubt Rodgers is blaming the lack of goals on Balotelli not pressing, that's just comical. Balo has been in and out with injuries, and has yet to have a run of games. 

And Idk why you are getting so god damn defensive with Rodgers. You are clearly blinded if you can't admit he has been awful this year. All of a sudden I have to be a professional football coach to judge his tactics and decisions? That would make every conversation you, me, or an other football fan ever had useless when discussing the game we love. Why even bother responding and defending someone when you clrealy know nothing about football? See how silly that argument sounds? I wont even go into my 'football credentials' bc that would just sound cringeworthy and a try hard... 

I am 100% on team Rodgers and the last thing I want to see is him leaving, but that doesn't spare him from criticism. Our defensive back/cdm has been in shambles 85% of this season, he has misused Stevie/Hendo/Lucas/Can etc on various occasions, Lallana has yet to get a real fair shake, our strikers have had zero support playing as a lone forward up top.. I take a lot of heat off of him bc we lost both Suarez and Strurridge this whole yr.. I do not expect to be fighting for 1st place at all. I don't even care much about all of the crappy results, what matters is that he has been making poor decisions and misusing a lot of talent.

Flint (defender) - he's like the best of both skrtel and agger put into one. 
 Luke ayling (defender) -  he's great at bringing the ball out of defence and very good at starting an attack
Jet or Jay emmanual Thomas (attacker) -  kinder like balotelli.  Lazy,  frustrating on the ball but ALWAYS has some bit of fame changing magic about him. Came through the arsenal academy. 

We have a rivalry with Bristol rovers,  not a friendly one either,  Yeovil and Swindon can be classed as a Derby game,  mostly because they are the only other big teams round the south West of England,  and Cardiff are a rival as there just over the channel (river severn).  Back in 2008 we nearly completed a double promotion league1 &gt; championship &gt;Bristol city but conceded a late goal in  the final.  We also once beat Liverpool in the fa cup back in the 1980's drew 0 0 and Ashton gate and beat Liverpool at anfield iirc.  

Going into history I'm not the best at it being a teenager,  but I can find lots of links on the Internet.  The competition we are in tonight (Johnstone paint trophy)  is contested between just league 1 and league 2 so not a major cup,  but it's a cup for lower teams etc,  if we win it we become the most successful team in it.

 It's a passionate team,  and a frustrating team to support as it's abit like Liverpool,  ironically but I believe we will be in the premier league by 2025,  owner has a good business plan,  invested into the future but hasn't thrown loads of money into the team.  Currently we are expanding the stadium from a 23000 to a 27000.  


Edit: forgot to mention we made Andy Cole the amazing player he became basin in the 1990's, also Tony pulis managed us at the same era,  Joe Jordan managed us,  he is the assistant manager who follows harry redknap every where.

My Great-Aunt was diagnosed with dementia last year. We'd initially put some of it down to normal age-related forgetfulness etc. She had a fall at home and broke her hip. She became very very confused and a lot of what she said made no sense. She'd claim to have been out for the afternoon with my Nana (deceased) or her husband (deceased) had been to visit her. She underwent an assessment and she was given a dementia diagnosis. They also assessed her as lacking mental capacity. 

We tried to keep her at home initially as it was what she wanted. We were given the maximum care package that our local authority could provide, which I believe was four visits a day. She went on to have a further fall and was admitted into hospital. Social workers and doctors made a best interest decision that she would be better off in a care home as she was no longer safe at home. 

We went through the process of finding her a suitable care home that would cater for her needs. Once a home was found, the topic of payment was brought up. She was unable to get any assistance with her care costs and so was to be completely self-funded. She has a will, but no power of attorney.  No-one had access to her funds. 

One option we were given, was for the local authority to take control of her finances and decision-making. The other was for a member of her family to apply to the Court of Protection to become a deputy, and take control of her finances. My Great-Aunt did not have any immediate family of her own; my Mother would be her next of kin. My Mother decided to apply to the Court of Protection. I was going to help her through the process but when looking at the forms, it was very confusing. She ended up going for a consultation with a solicitor for some further assistance. 

The Court of Protection process isn't the easiest. My Mother decided to have a solicitor assist with the matter. You have to get medical evidence to confirm that the person lacks mental capacity etc and it has a rather laborious process. After months of waiting, and a large solicitor bill (this money can be recouped from my Great-Aunt's funds), my Mother is now her deputy. She has to keep tight records of all expenditure and any decisions made must be in my Great-Aunt's best interests. 

I know this situation is quite different from your own, but I hope the Court of Protection aspect may be of help to you. I would suggest seeking further advice before you do anything. You may wish to approach Citizens Advice or alternatively, some Solicitors will offer a 30 minute free consultation (this is what my Mother did). I'm sure people of her can provide you with some guidance, but this is something that requires professional advice.

For a start, he is working; he wants to appear in martial arts films, so athletic training and getting what work experience he can grab is as important for him as going to university would be for a teacher; the fact that one option is officially supported whilst the other isn't doesn't really make any difference, to my mind. In some ways, he's actually being quite sensible about it; being on JSA means cheaper gym membership; if he worked enough to pay for the gym membership then he might not have the chance to train. If his career does take off (and he seems to be pretty serious about it) then he's likely to pay back more than enough in income tax and national insurance stamps to cover this period in spades. Getting a minimum-wage job out of some sort of puritan work-ethic obligation is likely to compromise that. Also, it's worth noting that if he's doing all this and not getting sanctioned by the DWP then the picture must be somewhat more complex than the DM is making out.

El Ahmadi was shit at best.

Lowton had a good season, and when he got a chance this season he didn't look too bad. Given more games I think he will find his form again. 

Vlaar, I don't like him. As a defender I think all our CB's are a better choice. I'm expecting a lot more from him. But as a leader I won't deny that he has been very important to us, and probably kept us up in his first season. All in all a good signing for the money. 

It's a bit harsh saying Bennett has been shit. He's not been the best, but I don't think we've seen the best of him. I would compare him to Delph. A few seasons ago a lot of people wanted Delph out, now everyone wants him to stay. I think Bennett could be a player like that. Haven't really gotten the chance to show his talent. 

Westwood was very cheap, is a regular starter and plays well. 

Bowery never got the chance to ahow what he can do. But didn't cost a lot. It was a gamble and could have paid off. 

Benteke has been decent overall, but apart from the second half of his first season he's been mediocre, and only shows up when we are playing big teams. He probably wants to be somewhere else. We can probably recoup what we spent on him. 

Tonev never really got a chance. Made a lot of mistakes when given the chance. I don't know what Lambert saw in him. 

Okore been injured for a long time, but has really started shining now. Sign him up before someone else moves in for him. 

Bacuna has been played out of position. Seems like a decent back up when played in position and didn't cost too much. 

Luna was worse than Bennett, dropped after half a season. I don't hope we see him again. 

Helenius have had a few lively cameos, but that's all. Hope he gets more chances, because he seems like a decent player. 

Steer has been given a few cup games, haven't imoressed nor made a fool of himself. Seems Lambert has lost faith in him by bringing back Given. 

Kozak will hopefully start more games when back from injury, and can hopefully continue what he started doing. Not quite matching Benteke at his best, but consistently better. 

Senderos. Too old, too slow, too injured, too much banned, probably paid too much. We can do a lot better. 

Cole. See above. 

Richardson looked like a decent but at the beginning of the season and brings some much needed experience. But that promise at the beginning of the season seems like it has faded. 

Cissokho haven't been too bad. We've seen worse left backs at Villa Park. But with the feeling that Bennett can do a lot better I feel the money could be spent elsewhere. 

Sanchez looked to slow and uncomfortable with the pace in the beginning, but has really stepped up lately. Decent buy. 

Sylla, can we really expect more from a player from ligue 2? Was a gamble like Bowery, didn't pay off. We sell him and everyone lives happily ever after. 

Bertrand was only a loan, but he seemed like the best left back we've had lately. With him at Southampton now there must have been an option to buy him. Why couldn't we get him?

The way I look at it there's been 9 succesful transfers, 9 failed ones, and we should await the verdict on the rest until given a proper chance. All in all that is not a bad track record conpared to the amount he's had to spend.

That's just plain not good enough for a leader of what is becoming a significant Westminister party.

&gt;and all citizens receive as of right a basic income â a Citizenâs Income. The cost of this would be recovered through a more progressive income tax system.

280bn has been the figure floated around for this. A ""progressive income tax system"" would have to almost double the level of tax taken in from income tax alone. A doubling of everyone's current tax band, pretty crazy stuff. The rich would run well before implementation.

&gt;Does the UK need a massive army given that Russia is no longer a threat or france?

I've literally just posted an article on Russian planes causing trouble for UK air traffic within the last 10 minutes. I don't know why people think that war or threat of war is somehow over or done with. The world is not a pleasant place where people get along, just look at the middle east crisis at the moment. Are we to let ISIS capture and enslave countless more women and children?

The thing is with war in the modern age is that it moves so fast. If there's no resistance an army can be across European countries within the day. We're at a lower risk of war than during the Cold War but we still have a risk nonetheless. I worry that the coming decades will resemble that of the 1930's where Britain scaled back its military significantly due to the national debt and France paid the price.

Facebook search, Instagram search or google search 'Vintage Hair Company Edinburgh', they are 21c Strathearn Road. If you have instagram or faceook you can see their pics of all the ombres and lightning they do which convinced me to book an appointment.


I went for my appointment yesterday. I have auburny coppery coloured hair that I've been box-dying for years and want to go lighter. I have been to a couple hairdressers to ask about doing this and they were useless and full of shit (charlie miller are just a rip off). 


Danielle at Vintage was totally honest with me about dying my hair and I felt like I was in a salon with a couple of easy going friends. I got my hair cut which I hate getting done because I find hairdressers often do what they want and I can't remember the last time I left feeling happy with my hair. Well she did exactly what I wanted, I love it and I am never going to another hairdressers again! 


They told me how to treat my hair to strip the colour a bit (rub fairy liquid on it every few nights and wash with head and shoulders!) and I'm going back in a couple of weeks to get a half head of highlights. They wouldn't do them yesterday because they knew I would be leaving with awful orangey hair, which I take as a good sign. Haircut was Â£27.50 which I found quite cheap. They gave me a price list:

Full head highlight and cut: from Â£79.50

Half head highlights and cut: from Â£69.50

Full head tint and cut: from Â£57.50

Ombre: from Â£73.50

I tried using those a few times and never found them too comfortable to wear. However, I found myself abroad one time in a room with terrible curtains/blinds (I forget which it was now), and definitely needed some kind of mask. Tried the one I'd pinched from the plane, too uncomfortable to fall asleep in. So, naturally, I set to improvising a suitable mask from what I had in my bag, that would be comfortable (lightweight, not too tight etc) and block out all light.

I ended up using one of [these](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Buff-Merino-Multi-Functional-Headwear/dp/B002PHHB62/ref=sr_1_4?s=clothing&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422570427&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=buff) (first result, I think I have a cheaper version). Folded over into itself twice, you end up with 8 layers of fabric - if it's a bigger one, you can repeat for 16 layers. Pull it on like a hat/headband until it covers your eyes, and the fabric pulls tight enough to block any gaps due to the nose, without being uncomfortable.

Obviously you may want a proper mask, but I've found this is preferable to me, so perhaps consider it as a backup option.",null,0,null,1422570639,null,0,false,0,co536ql,null,t3_2u37ar,null,t1_co536ql,null,t1_co50q4j,null,null,null,1424317942,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Being scared of a female Doctor because the character is flawed and ultimately made better by a companion is really childish. 

Does Davison really think that a scene where a female Doctor is about to make a mistake, then is questioned or corrected by a male companion, is going to set back women's rights fifty years?

Does he think so little of women that he believes they can't handle being portrayed as complex, flawed, and imperfect? Does he really think so little of men that only *we* need to be questioned and corrected?

Please. 

*Doctor Who* can be praised for normalizing (to some extent) LGBTQs without shining a big ol' spotlight on them, and the show I believe plays mostly to our better moral sensibilities. Maintaining the male-Doctor-female-companion paradigm flies in the face of mature gender sensibilities.

True Detective I really liked for an American cop show.

We had to pay taxes for the upkeep of the Empire (for all the American whinging - colonial taxes were astonishingly low and tea had never been cheaper than at the time of the Tea Party due to the Tea Act and was largely the action of smugglers worried they'd be put out of business) and yet the profits of the Empire were privately held in Government bonds (such as the famous Consol) and shares in the Trading Companies.

So really unless you were wealthy enough to have a stake in the Empire you just lost out - the people that expatriated to the Colonies and were fortunate enough to find success there (it was great opportunity but also great risk) also benefited a lot.

Why do you think selling in person would be better than Etsy? Selling in person brings about overheads and all sorts of costs, which i'm assuming you can't afford to incur right now. For niche sectors and cottage industry products the internet is a gold mine - you have no costs and can reach the world from your armchair.

I would suggest that if your sales arnt really ramped on Etsy focusing your online exposure and marketing would be the issue more than volume sales at somewhere like the makers market (which is worth a pop). 

Consider this - if your at the makers market you've got transport costs, stock level issues, stand design etc. - this all costs money to rely on what's know as ""impulse purchases"" - basically people who happen to be walking past and think - wow thats a nice necklace.

Now take your online model - no costs, just your time giving your brand (you) exposure. Now when somebody googles ""i want to buy an axe necklace"" your results are first. This is a ""targeted purchase""

The result of the latter is a larger gross profit per unit but lower volume. However keep at it and the volume rises along with your prices, stock and lines. 

Tumblr, facebook, twitter etc. are all free to use and can gain huge amounts of interest - not to mention an instagram and pintrest feed which are based on images - again great in your vertical.

Just my 2pence...
