After all, one of the reasons the price has dropped is because OPEC have failed to alter production after the November meeting. 

I made a point of referring to the 'middle east' playing their trump card and not OPEC playing their trump card.

Obviously it's still incorrect to refer to the wider 'middle east' like I did, more specifically I was referring to Saudi Arabia and the wider 'Gulf nations'. Iran is a middle eastern country but production there is being hurt by the price drop as well. 

Some of the Gulf nations are playing that 'trump card' and keeping prices low because they can afford to do so and like I said, it's cutting off the ability of many other nations (including some OPEC nations) to produce economically.

That was an attacking miscommunication ( Icardi should've passed to Osvaldo) and this was a defensive miscommunication (Kaboul should not have tried to play an offside trap, I think it was?). Apart from the fact that they occurred on opposite ends of the pitch, I think they are similar incidents. 

Maybe this is just me, but I dont think Vertonghen should've done what he did. I think it only creates more mistrust and stress in the back line. Considering that Kaboul started shouting back it's not like he thought ""Agh Jan's right and thats the kick in the arse that I needed."" Jan could have waited until the ball was out of play in Burnley's third and had a private conversation with Kaboul. Or anything that does not mean berating a player on his own team. 

Obviously Kaboul is at fault here due to his defensive error, but I do think Jan could have handled it better. He's nowhere close to being like Osvaldo, but berating a fellow teammate during a game in front of a loud section is something that personally I cannot get behind.

AVB would've maybe taken the credit for appointing Kaboul as captain *after* the players' election - maybe he has his own choices, tells the squad he's got some options in mind, then comes back an hour later and gives the armband to Kaboul, making it appear he's in control.

Poch didn't attempt to control this part of the team wisdom. He understands that even in the position he and AVB are (were) in, you can't control everything about your team. He's very wise. This moment wasn't about Poch pulling the strings, but rather was a result of Poch's managing, or to be specific, non-managing. If he picked Kaboul, anytime that Kaboul made a mistake, Poch would be in question. Since the players picked Kaboul, the players are held in question.

Yeah, I saw that. *Nice*. Sarcastic prick might have been fair. 

&gt; These people are not under arrest for a crime. 

I didn't say they were. I'm illustrating that simply taking someone at their word on the basis that it then shouldn't be questioned is moronic. 

&gt;They are having their access to the women's toilet questioned for dressing not enough like women, apparently. 

Indeed. I'd question it if I saw a man enter a women's toilet or a women entering a man's. 

&gt;The security guard has zero reason to disbelieve that they're women

Their appearance, rightly or wrongly. Other people thought the two were men, so did the security guard it seems. Given that it seems standard for women to use women's toilets and men to use men's toilets, where is the illegitimacy in thinking that two people that others' thought to be men in a women's toilet is questionable?

&gt;Two reasons to believe they are, namely the fact they used the women's toilet and the fact they said, when asked, that they're women.

So, as a man, if I walk into and use a women's bathroom, and also say I'm a women upon doing so, I'm now a women and that can't be questioned by others? 

I'm not saying the security guard handled this brilliantly. I'm also not saying they shouldn't be allowed to use the women's toilet (obviously). 

I'm saying stating ""I'm a women"" when people believe you to be a man isn't evidence or reason enough to give a definitive verdict and the security guard to drop concerns, in the same way a suspected thief stating ""I'm not a thief"" isn't evidence or reason enough to give a definitive verdict and the security guard to drop concerns.

It's funny you touch on this, being a major deterministic risk factor for obesity, yet you refuse to believe in anything other than lazyness and willpower.

&gt;It's not genetics

Intra-family variability of obesity risk is certainly in part down to genetics.  Adopted children have a greater association to the BMI of their biological parents than they do their adoptee parents.  I can provide the reference later but I'm sure you can google it.  

&gt;it's dumb cunt parents not knowing how to feed themselves and the impressionable kids they're responsible for.

Again, you've hit on a big risk factor for obesity and a reason for transgenerational passage of obesity risk, yet you can't make that final logical step that these contributing factors make it extremely hard for some families to *avoid* obesity.

The way I see it is that they awarded Jose when they know there isn't going to be a close competitor in the running. For example, if Scottish came out tomorrow and named SAF  scottish coach of the century, I think people would be fine with that because he is just untouchable.

I'm not a huge classic Who fan, so I'm aware of The Master. But mostly as the big bad before the wilderness years. The kiss and her whole bad mama vibe became darkly comedic after I knew her identity...partially because I was really picturing Derek Jacobi pushing Peter Capaldi up against a wall and making out with him, not Michelle Gomez. (I realize some of you might find the Capaldi/Jacobi image rather stimulating...not my cup of Earl Grey, but to each his or her own slashfic.)

It gets him involved earlier in the attack where his decision making and dribbling in tight spaces can get maximized. Also, his shooting hasn't been super great so I'd prefer Sterling over Coutinho for finishing, although I think it may help Coutinho to get some more open looks at goal when he arrives late to the final third of the pitch from midfield.

I'd put Hendo at the RWB position, and move Sterling up to the attacking role behind Sturridge with Lallana, where defenders would have a tough choice between defending his and Sturridge's runs.

Pretty much the only way they can possibly enforce this is by completely removing all telecommunications technology from the country, throwing us back to the middle ages. Oh yes... not even communication by torch flashing will be legal, since that is a form of encryption.

EDIT: To explain why they'd have to remove all telecommunications technology: not only do you need a phone line to get on the internet, which relies on encryption to maximise security, there's also the part where you could be sending morse messages down the actual phone line itself. The only way to enforce a ban on that is to either a) have people listening to your private conversations looking for potentially encrypted information or b) get rid of it altogether.

It's not mistreatment to be asked, when ambiguous, in a situation where it is completely relevant, whether you're a man, or a woman. You should develop a thicker skin if you find something so simple as that to be a huge problem. 

Additionally, you need to stop deciding my opinions for me. Defending the status quo?

The reason I draw the relation to Tumblr is that you seem to share the Feelz Before Realz approach. Your arguments throughout this thread have been strongly based on the possibility that transgender people might be offended by being misgendered. Are you transgender? Do you have firsthand experience, or are you only talking on their behalf without asking? 

Nobody can tell if a person is transgender or not at a glance. And when someone is going through the bathroom door, chances are a glance is all you're getting.

Tax isn't all that complicated to tax specialists.  It is literally and metaphorically not rocket science.  However, there will be things that are obvious to an accountant that you don't know.

Having an accountant prepare your accounts and return make it considerably less likely that you don't miss out on reliefs that you're entitled to.  It's not inconceivable that this can save you more than you pay them.

Additionally, in the (relatively unlikely) event that you're selected for an enquiry by HMRC the penalties that arise from errors are based on behaviour.  If you've employed a competent advisor it's likely that any errors would be Despite Taking Reasonable Care and this means no penalty.

At the cheaper end of things you're probably talking about a couple of hundred quid.  If that looks to you like a cost that is well worth the lessened stress, go with it.  You can look at it after the fact and make a decent assessment of whether it was worthwhile and next year you'll have a better feel for whether it was money well spent, or if you'd rather deal with the stress and keep the cash.

Two last points:    
a. As you probably know your return is now due in in a couple of weeks.  You may struggle to get an accountant to take you on (or to take you on without charging extra for the rush job) now.  You can submit an estimated return and you have a year to make revisions.  If you're pushed for time, do this.  There's a free text space, where you can and should explain that you used estimated figures and will resubmit when the figures are finalised.  This will save you from late filing penalties.    
b. If you use an accountant, after they prepare your accounts and return ask them what they would recommend you do differently in your records to make them easier to work from.  The accountant will likely be happy to do this, because it's literally a short conversation and if you stay with them it makes their work in future years easier.  The benefit to you is that you get to deal with any issues early on.",null,0,null,1421351938,null,0,false,0,cnq3e4t,null,t3_2sipto,null,t1_cnq3e4t,null,t3_2sipto,null,null,null,1424857725,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

As backup/cover for Eriksen, yes.  Obviously not instead of Eriksen, which is what some people have mistakenly thought I (and now Keskekun and smokey815 and a few others) was talking about.  

Right now, Pochettino is using Paulinho as cover for Eriksen, and I think Soldado has more of the qualities Pochettino would want from his number 10 than Paulinho does.

Also, I don't want to use Kane as cover for the 10 role because I want Kane playing as many games as he can at the 9.  When he's not being rested, he should be our striker.

EDIT:  I mean for this season.  In the summer, if we can get someone better who's a more complete number 10 to backup Eriksen, great.  CM, ST, LW, and backup CB are all higher priorities though.

EDIT 2: And no matter what we do with Soldado, we still need another striker who can score, to back up Kane right now.",null,0,null,1421353059,null,0,1421354130,0,cnq44a4,null,t3_2sj3ua,null,t1_cnq44a4,null,t3_2sj3ua,null,null,null,1424857386,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

He's strong, he is hard to knock over, he dribbles close, and while he has the tricks and the flair, he doesn't need it. He dribbles through people like Messi does. He controls a game much like Messi can. Every attack goes through him and he can create a chance out of nothing. Neymar's a great player too, but I personally think his excessive use of tricks is not as effective as Hazard's dribble style. In addition to that, and let me preface this by saying I'm not knocking him because I dislike diving, but his willingness to go down easily vs. Hazard's drive to stay up puts him at a disadvantage. One of the most impressive things about Hazard, and it's another thing that makes him similar to Messi, is that he does not got down if he has a choice. He gets fouled hard and stays on his feet and keeps playing. You know he's been fouled hard when he goes down because fights to stay on his feet when he can. By not going down, he keeps the play alive and usually can make a chance that he couldn't have if he'd taken the foul.

Person B: ""No, that's a bad idea because I wouldn't want to be confronted by a woman having just taken a huge dump""

Clear so far? Let's see how the argument goes when we switch genders:

Person A: ""Idea: Maybe we should have mixed gendered toilets?""

Person B: ""No, that's a bad idea because I wouldn't want to be confronted by a man having just taken a huge dump""

Now the argument falls apart because the situation described by Person B could happen regardless of the idea proposed by Person A. The fact that the person outside the cubicle waiting to in is female is *a key part to Person B's argument*. Therefore, we can use the power of deduction to reason that Person B would have different feelings if the person outside the cubicle was male.

Thank you for contacting the BBC iPlayer Support Team.

I understand you would like to listen to Radio Scotland on your Android Mobile phone.

At the moment this is not possible because the equipment used in our local radio and Nations studios is not currently capable of producing the digital assets we require for BBC iPlayer Radio on many connected devices, including those using the Android operating system.

A significant project to resolve this is underway, including the provision and installation of new audio equipment in radio studios across the UK. Due to the scale of this work, it is likely to take some months to complete. Please bear with us.

I have added your desire to see this to our iPlayer reports that are available to the personnel responsible for maintaining and improving the BBC iPlayer service, including Dan Taylor Watt, the Head of BBC iPlayer. These reports are viewed as important documents that can help shape decisions on future aspects of BBC iPlayer.

I'm sure you've seen that ""policies for people"" page on the UKIP website - so I'm not sure I understand.

edit:

/u/Barry_Scotts_Cat deleted his comment:

&gt;What is UKIP policy? Outisde of ""LEAVE DUH EEEE YUH""

I spent about twenty minutes looking through UKIP's policy page, picking out the ones they often talk about (as the next counter-point would be that they only ever talk about the EU - which isn't actually true) and came back to find the comment I was replying to had been deleted. I didn't want it to go to waste, and in case somebody in future comes and says basically the same thing - these are the policies UKIP's leadership have tended to mention in their frequent appearances on the news and political shows, since they started receiving increased coverage.

----
http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people

So by linking this page I feel like I should clarify that I'm basically not trying to endorse UKIP. But their policies are about as vague as any other opposition party's, and nobody has a manifesto yet - so saying they don't have a manifesto right now is technically correct, but misleading at best.

Anyway, since like most parties it's important to listen to what they say as well as what they list in their policies but don't generally talk about, here's a few of their most talked-about policies. I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of them - that was not the basis for choosing - this is my impression of the policies the UKIP leadership have tended to mention in the past couple of years of coverage they've been receiving. In other words, the policies most important to them There's quite a few of them, but that's because they talk about a lot of things outside of leaving the EU - though that is obviously the big objective. Some of these policies are spoken about more than others, I left it in the order in which they appear on the website.

&gt;– We would negotiate a bespoke trade agreement with the EU to enable our businesses to continue trading to mutual advantage. 

&gt;– UKIP would not seek to remain in the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) or European Economic Area (EEA) while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labour, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.

&gt;– We would reoccupy the UK’s vacant seat at the World Trade Organisation. 

&gt;– UKIP will increase personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings (approx £13,500 by next election).

&gt;– UKIP will leave the EU and save at least £8bn pa in net contributions.  

&gt;– UKIP will scrap the HS2 project which is uneconomical and unjustified.

&gt;– Subject to academic performance UKIP will remove tuition fees for students taking approved degrees in science, medicine, technology, engineering, maths on the condition that they live, work and pay tax in the UK for five years after the completion of their degrees.  

&gt;– UKIP will scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going to university.

&gt;– Existing schools will be allowed to apply to become grammar schools and select according to ability and aptitude. Selection ages will be flexible and determined by the school in consultation with the local authority.  

&gt;– We will resource fully our military assets and personnel.

&gt;– UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.

&gt;– We will stop further use of PFI in the NHS and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where this is affordable.

&gt;– We will ensure that GPs’ surgeries are open at least one evening per week, where there is demand for it.

&gt;– UKIP opposes plans to charge patients for visiting their GP.

&gt;–We will ensure that visitors to the UK, and migrants until they have paid NI for five years, have NHS-approved private health insurance as a condition of entry to the UK, saving the NHS £2bn pa. UKIP will commit to spending £200m of the £2bn saving to end hospital car parking charges in England.

&gt;– We will ensure foreign health service professionals coming to work in the NHS are properly qualified and can speak English to a standard acceptable to the profession.

&gt;– UKIP recognises the benefits of limited, controlled immigration.

&gt;– UKIP will leave the EU, and take back control of our borders. Work permits will be permitted to fill skills gaps in the UK jobs market.

&gt;– UKIP supports a diverse energy market including coal, nuclear, shale gas, geo-thermal, tidal, solar, conventional gas and oil.

&gt;– UKIP supports the development of shale gas with proper safeguards for the local environment. 

&gt;– There will be no new subsidies for wind farms and solar arrays.

&gt;– UKIP will abolish green taxes and charges in order to reduce fuel bills.

&gt;– UKIP will leave the Common Fisheries Policy and reinstate British territorial waters.

&gt;– UKIP supports the recall of MPs as was originally promised in the Coalition Agreement, whereby 20% of the electorate in a constituency must sign a recall petition within eight weeks. The approval of MPs will not be required to initiate a recall petition.

&gt;– UKIP will introduce the Citizens’ Initiative to allow the public to initiate national referendums on issues of major public interest.

&gt;– UKIP will withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. 

&gt;– UKIP will reverse the government’s opt-in to EU law and justice measures, including the European Arrest Warrant and European Investigation Order. We will replace the EAW with appropriate bi-lateral agreements.

&gt;– UKIP will ensure that the law is rigorously enforced in relation  to ‘cultural’ practices which are illegal in Britain, such as forced marriages, FGM and so-called ‘honour killings’

&gt;– UKIP will amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open smoking rooms properly ventilated and separated from non-smoking areas.

There are certainly some who oppose GM in general, and there are likewise some who favour it, but the stance on Monsanto is where there is common ground between both sides. Food production shouldn't be monopolised and controlled in the way Monsanto do it; it's almost feudal in its arrangement.

Another objection to GM is on the grounds of concerns over biodiversity. More varieties of the same crop (like carrots) is good for the robustness of our food production if climate changes to make it more difficult to grow crops, as if some varieties struggle, there are other varieties we can grow instead. If GM crops narrow the number of varieties we use that puts our food security at risk.

I personally, and several people I know, do not object to GM on grounds of ""chemicals"" as certain portions of society like to accuse and ridicule. And of course if there are some people who object to GM ""because chemicals"" then they are clearly uneducated on the topic and don't understand the real issues surrounding it.

Ok then. 

2014 Local election results for UKIP and Greens:


UKIP - 163 (up 161)

Greens - 38 (up 18)

So, the greens are still behind.
___
EU election results:

MEPs:

Greens (Including Scottish Greens) : 3

UKIP: 24

Votes:

Greens : 1,136,670	

UKIP: 4,376,635

Again, greens are behind.

See the point? You can base it on recent polling or on the most recent election results and it still puts UKIP significantly ahead.

For an individual your tax period ends on April 5th and the filing date is October 31st for paper returns and January 31st for online returns.  The due and payable date under self-assessment is also January 31st.

If your return is late [in theory any time from 00.01 on February 1st] you get charged a penalty of £100.  If it's more than three months late, you get charged £10 per day for every day from May 1st, capped at £900.  If your return is six months late you get charged the higher of £300 or 5% of the tax for the year.   If your return is 12 months late you get charged the higher of **another** £300 or 5% of the tax for the year.  

On top of all this, if your tax is paid late you will be charged a penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax *(on the penalty date)* for any tax paid late at 30 days, six months and 12 months.

If you did your return around March or April last year you probably incurred at least the £100 initial late filing penalty.  Probably the 5% late payment penalty too.

Ok, that's the bad news.  It's not the end of the end of the world though.

As I said, you can submit an estimated return.  That deals with your potential late filing penalties.

If you have at least an idea what your tax liability is likely to be you can pay that.  The 5% penalties are 5% of the tax unpaid at the penalty date.  So, if you pay 90% of your tax, the penalty for late payment at 30 days would only be 5% of the 10% you underpaid.  

Small accountants tend to be really busy this time of the year.  But, if you can't get one who can take you on to deal with things in the next couple of weeks, you probably won't have any problems getting them to look at it it in February.  An estimated return would give you that time.

Now, there's one more thing I suspect you're not aware of, which you need to know about:  Payments on account.

There are three dates when payments are due for each tax year:    
January 31st during the tax year.    
July 31st during the tax year.     
January 31st after the tax year.

The first two are 50% of the tax due for the previous year.  The last is any left over balance.

This means that for 2013/14 you should have made two payments on account already:
First payment on account:  January 31st 2014.    
Second payment on account:  July 31st 2014.

On the up-side, because the in-year payments are based on the tax liability for the previous year and you were only self-employed for a short time, these would have been fairly small.

You can't do anything about those now, but you should understand that you have a payment on account for 2014/15 coming up in a couple of weeks and another in July.  I've seen incidences here where accountants haven't thought to explain that to their clients, so be sure to mention it to an accountant.

Hopefully this isn't too daunting.  I just thought it might help you get things all tidied up.  Good luck.

i agree with popeychops, for starters, we actually started the season off very well with some scrappy, but solid wins again a very strong southhampton side, lost in a kinda shitty way against city (at city) and destroyed a tottenham side that was supposed to be a year on from ""bale-gate"". we started playing poorly in september, and if you remember correctly lobbmaster, we lost our best player. you may or may not have heard of him, Daniel Sturridge. its borderline insane to not give him criticism, sure i'll give you that. it'st he coaches job to get it right, and with so many things going wrong, putting out one fire just leads to 3 or 4 more. it wasn't getting better from a results standpoint, but the squad had to be broken down and rebuild. and he has started to do that. but the guy above is so right...how many people were circle jerking over rafa? im sorry, maybe this is just my opinion, but i don't think rafa was as great of a coach as people make him out to be. and yes you can talk about money, hg ownership, blah blah blah blah, but his cl squad, he inherited a core from houiller, he had an in form stevie for the entirety of his stint with us and quite frankly had a lot of luck in a knockout competition that fc porto had won a year prior with mourinho (who did have some good players). rodgers has done very well at redeveloping an ethos, an identity, and anybody with any sense would see what he is building here. yes, our committee/brendao have gotten it horribly wrong on some transfers, particularly victor moses, aspas, and to some extent sahin, but for the most part, a lot of the transfers who get stick really haven't performed terribly at all. 

what did he do well, you ask? he kept us in the league cup. he asserted  the club was greater than any player, even a legend like steven gerrard. he has kept us to 1 loss since the dreadful palace game, against a man u side that really shouldn't have beaten 3-0, or at all for that matter. brendan had to rely on a 19/20 year old kid to carry the burden of chief creator, goal scorer because no one else stepped up to the plate. finally, another thing he got right, he started rossiter vs boro, who got his first lfc goal. 

in addition, we had arsenal esque injury luck the first half of the season with marko, lallana, sahko, sturridge, flanno, glenjo, lovren, suso (who i know is gone but would have been useful), balotelli who have all missed significant time this season. there are no excuses, many managers have to deal with these issues, but think about the timing of absolutely everything and how negatively that would impact any team. i mean shit, look at dortmund who have hummels, gundogan, reus, subotic, mkhitryan, pierre emerick auba...they have a good squad, and they are dead last almost in bundesliga. it just goes to show how many factors really can play against you. 

so yes BR isn't fully infallible, but by no means did BR deserve all of the stick he got for this. he took it on the chin, and as i've said before, he is a genius for how he has handled the media. cookie cutter answers, make himself look like god (self inflated ego), etc...he takes a lot of pressure off of his players who need to be out of the spotlight and puts it on the players who he thinks might get a kick out of it (see balotelli threads from early on and how people were bashing him for ""throwing balo under the bus""...balo needed a kick in the arse for the age, experience and money we spent on him).

The sheer amount of power we can get out of nuclear does come at a cost of safety concerns and waste generation. So if we can use a safer design that produces less waste, then we should. We should pioneer in that sort of technology, like our country did with Magnox.

Still, I feel much worse about burning coal, oil and gas than making steam with nuclear. Coal is killing thousands of people a year due to pollution; we're fucking causing earthquakes to extract oil and gas, which as pollutants have the same effect as coal.

In terms of death toll, in the long run, less people at Fukushima have died so far from radiation effects than heavy pollution than the estimated number of people who have died from fossil fuel pollution in the 12 months.

One is the question of whether he committed a crime; and the other is the question of whether he should be allowed to play football.

I've just read two columns by Suzanne Moore in the Guardian; the first was about Charlie Hebdo and censorship and how someone's feeling of being offended is not the proper basis for conducting society; the second is about Ched Evans and how he should play football because she is disgusted by him and/or what he did. I suspect she hasn't noticed the link.

Evans was convicted of a modern version of rape which can be paraphrased as: not taking sufficient care to ensure that the girl's ""Yes"" means 'Yes', and isn't too out of it to know what she's saying. It's part of a change of emphasis that came in with the new Sexual Offences Act of 2003 (a horrible mangling of what had been a very good Sexual Offences Act 1956). 

Personally I find that definition of rape offensive; however, it is what it is and that's the law. Evans didn't run away to another country, he didn't hide like a massive wimp in a South American embassy, he went to Court and took his lumps. He went quietly to prison afterwards and served his incarceration. Like anyone else he is now out on licence to serve the remainder. 

Part of the rationale behind release on licence is rehabilitation. That seems to have been lost in the argument.

People are complaining that he's not apologising. But his appeal against conviction has been fast-tracked before the Criminal Cases Review Commission, so this would be a pretty stupid time to apparently admit guilt.

So, should he play football? Should he be allowed to take up a contract with a club that thinks he'll fit in their team? Yes. People will be disgusted - like Suzanne Moore - but that's not a good reason. She even said so herself. If he was a skilled labourer, no-one suggests that he should be told he can only work as an unskilled labourer the rest of his life. Society - the Courts, Parliament, and us as the voters who put MPs in power - have decided what his punishment should have been, and he's done/doing it. 

We seem to be sadly moving into an era when thousands of half-wits can be rabble-roused on Twitter to sign online petitions on the basis of half a sentence in a newspaper report and that tide of outrage can affect people's lives, seriously,  and potentially for  ever.

Ok, honestly I imagine there are some shitty areas that you'd be wise not to tread in. But I grew up in a fairly nice town on the south coast and *that* had shitty council estates you wouldn't want to tread in by choice after dark. It's all about using your noodle. 

I currently live in an area called Balsall Heath slightly south of the city centre. It's not the nicest part of Birmingham - it's also (un-related) a quite Muslim area. A lot of non-white families live here. I've not had any problems at all. 

As I mentioned in a thread elsewhere - I once got home from work to find some Middle-Eastern kids sitting on my garden wall playing. They looked terrified and asked if I minded them being on the wall. I was touched that they asked - I've had less respect from white British kids. 

Now in fairness it's not perfect. I've had dirty looks in the streets from some Muslim men - simply for existing, as I wasn't doing anything particularly exciting. They also think nothing of spitting on the pavement and some families tend to see the women follow several feet behind the men. 

There's also a butchers across the road from me which openly displays that it prepares meat in Halal fashion *without* stunning the animal first. I'm not OK with that -and don't shop there. 

Then there's incidents like [this one](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/06/mankini-charity-walk-police-escort-paedophiles_n_3713613.html) where some men collecting for a charity were attacked whilst their Mankini Walk went through a Muslim area. The police made them leave for their own protection. Not great. 

In the middle of town there's often loud religious promotions going on, handing out free religious texts and preaching the word of their god. Fine - but a bit too loud. In fairness there are a couple of loud Christian preachers so I guess it evens out. 

**So is it a war zone?** No. It's not. It has some rough-round-the-edges areas and I have observed that not all Muslim people are friendly - there is a certain introverted atmosphere - but it's certainly not spilling into anything I'd feel I need to leave the city for.

Against Basel 4 months into the season we fielded a starting XI where 9 out of 11 players have been in this team and training under Rodgers for 2.5 years, plus Lovren and Lambert (Lambert had by then played for a full 90 minutes in five games in a row in the two weeks before this very important game.

Yes we played ok untill Sturridge got injured (apart from Rodgers trying out the Gerrard - Henderson partnership at the back against Southampton yet again).

After the Tottenham-game we started playing with 7-8 of the players that Rodgers have trained for 2.5 years in every game, focusing on possesion-football, and playing Balotelli/Lambert as a lone isolated striker, this lasted for more or less 20 games straight. Balotelli that has never played as a lone striker! He doesn't even like to get in the box, all of Balotellis skillsets are made for being a supporting striker.. 

 In this period we created very few chances, conceded ALOT of chances, had a lot of errors (probably because we played possesion in our own half instead of attacking, Lucas being on the bench and Sakho having a disagreement with Rodgers). For 20 games straight! 

Markovic/Lallana/Coutinho didn't get much time, and we have seen all of them be benched the next game after having a couple of good games, playing alot better than the players that replaced them. 

Can was, to quote Rodgers, not getting playing time because he needed to adapt to Rodgers philosophy first, he said this while we were playing the worst football compared to the squad available since probably sometime before Hodgson.

Yes he kept us in the league cup, but that weird game against Middlesborough can hardly be called an achievement of the manager or tactics. The United-game was the first game since the Tottenham-game were we started attacking again, and I agree that we were unlucky, as I said originally, up untill mid-december he did most of the stuff wrong, the United-game was a big step in the right direction, starting to play with midfielders that can create chances and players that have pace in the team (aside from STerling). Marko, Lallana and Sakho all got benched when they were healthy also though, but yes injuries have been a bit bad, but not bad enough to explain our results or formations. 

He did throw balo under the bus, he used him completely wrong and then blamed balo for not returning results.

The answer is actually pretty simple for me. I'd buy a striker now, put Paulinho in rotation for the attacking mid spot, and leave Soldado as third choice for both spots. 

This sort of reaction is all based on ""he got two assists"" in all honesty. Are we going to put Paulinho in the pivot because he did well centrally? If not, why should Soldado play out of position when his goals return have been terrible for us? 

Still haven't addressed my point on the goals, actually.

Argumentum Ad Monsantium.

&gt;There are certainly some who oppose GM in general, and there are likewise some who favour it, but the stance on Monsanto is where there is common ground between both sides.

There are a lot of people who support GM and have no problem with monsanto at all. I have yet to see a valid argument against monsanto that isn't a generic anti-capitalist or anti-IP argument (and hence, not really an argument against monsanto). 

I have read the court cases that get cited and in every case the person being sued was in clear, deliberate and blatant breech of contract. 

 I have looked into their involvement with Agent Orange, where they warned the US military about the potential results but the military did not care. Blame the person who presses the trigger, not the person who built the trigger. By the standards of anti-monsanto activists IKEA should be considered evil for selling knives that get used to stab people.

I have looked into the claim that they cause farmer suicides in India. This is completely false. Someone took the data for an extra 200,000 suicides from farmers above the base rate of suicide in India and assumed Monsanto was responsible for every single one, without any justification for that assumption at all. Complete nonsense. 

Incidentally, opposition to deployment of golden rice from groups such as Greenpeace has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and blinding of children across India, yearly. If any group is grossly unethical, it is Greenpeace.

And why are Monsanto singled out on this? DuPont is almost as big and has near-identical practices. Is it just because Monsanto is the only one most people know about? Do anti-GMO activists and organic food producers not have a large enough marketing budget to demonize both companies so they just focus on one?

&gt;it's almost feudal in its arrangement.

Do you know the definition of feudalism?

Feudalism; A political and economic system of Europe from the 9th to about the 15th century, based on the holding of all land in fief or fee and the resulting relation of lord to vassal and characterized by homage, legal and military service of tenants, and forfeiture.

The definition of feudalism isn't ""Stuff I don't like"".

&gt;Another objection to GM is on the grounds of concerns over biodiversity.

The solution to this is to remove some of the draconian and illogical restrictions on GM usage. Modifying multiple crop varieties is easy but all the red tape in the way means getting even one of the created varieties legalized in the US is difficult enough.

&gt;But being pro-GM just because the chemical-fearing idiots are against it is just as uneducated a position to hold.

People are not pro-GM because idiots are anti-GM. People are pro-GM because we see the good it can do in the world and see it as an essential technology for supporting human needs in the 21st century.

There's a massive campaign against Monsanto which, if you take the time to research the issues, is based on a lot of misinformation. 

This thread is a good example, GM topics always turn into Monsanto, even though they aren't even the largest biotech company selling GM, nor do they have the largest market share. 

Anti-gm has just become anti-monsanto, because it allows people to still be anti-gm when they have no scientific grounds to be so. 

I personally used to be quite anti Monsanto (I've always been extremely pro GM as I studied genetics at uni and have a decent understanding of the science) since I had to defend GM on wave after wave of attacks on Monsanto. Then one day after being told by my partners father than Monsanto got the government to refuse Aid to haiti unless they accepted GM seeds I decided to look in to it (I didn't think any company could be that much of a cartoonish villian). Long story short, they aren't. Most of the stories about them are fabricated by anti-gm websites (Haiti, for example, Monsanto had donated a heap of non-gm crops, free from any sort of licensing agreements, which anti-gm activists managed to convince the poor farmers to burn for some reason). 

The more you look in to it the more ridiculous it is. 

Suing for accidental contamination, never happend. 

Agent Orange, developed by the defense dept. and Monsanto and other companies were forced to produce it, and warned the government about the dangers of dioxin contamination. 

Terminator seeds, never been available. Monsanto bought the company that developed them and has agreed (after public outcry, even though it would in theory stop gm contamination of other crops) to not commercialise it. 

In the rare case they actually take someone to court for willfully violating their patent they donate or suspend (on the condition the offending stops) any money awarded.

Take some time to actually look in to it and don't use any source that's obviously an anti-gm website. ",null,0,null,1421360420,null,0,false,0,cnq8xra,null,t3_2sf5ql,null,t1_cnq8xra,null,t1_cnpnlyk,null,null,null,1424855138,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

He has spent his entire career familiarizing himself with the positioning and passing of a striker,  not an AM. He can put in a quality cross, but what about a through ball downfield? What about a switch of play? This isn't FIFA, just because you want to say he objectively passes well and has good vision doesnt mean he passes well as a midfielder or would have good midfield vision. He is weak in the air and isnt really that good a dribbler, but im not going to argue that point with you; itll go nowhere. Eriksen's aerial ability and tackling has improved immensely this season, and 30 year old soldado would probably be expected to do the same. Can he run 12 km a match as an AM like Eriksen does? Can he get 1.2 tackles a game? Hell, can he even attempt multiple tackles without picking up a yellow?

Are the DUP jealous they have no culture to defend?

&gt; It would be deeply divisive in an already divided society.

But maintaining second-class rights to an entire peoples language surely will help unite the society... 

&gt; It would be incredibly expensive at a time of financial austerity

No, it wouldn't be 'incredibly expensive' - at least the majority of it wouldn't. Giving it equal rights costs nothing. We already have bilingual Irish/English speakers here, they can work as teachers, I'd be in favour of being taught Irish instead of French, if we had to choose one or the other for economical reasons.

&gt; and I have no doubt that Sinn Fein would see it as a way of creating ""jobs for the boys"". Just think of all those republicans who learned Irish in the Maze.

Fucking disgusting that the DUP have equated the Irish language Act as a way of 'funding terrorists'. What disgusting cunts they are.

&gt; If Sinn Fein really wants to do something for Irish they should decommission their cultural weaponry and end their cultural war.

My opinion wasn't founded on whether he had committed a crime or not, or whether he'd be found guilty or not guilty for the alleged crime. At the time of the alleged incident Ravel was carrying an injury. He was supposed to be in London rehabbing at the club. Why then was he arrested in Manchester at 4:30 am when he was due in London that very same morning to work on his injury? How is that in any way respecting the agreement you've made with your employer and the supporters who have been patiently waiting for you to put in a proper shift. At no point have I ""buried the poor bastard"" based on the accusations of his ex-girlfriend. Good for him that he has been cleared of charges.

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"They don't have a choice. His release clause can be activated, and if Reus chooses to go to Bayern, then there's nothing they can do about it. There is no way they'd let him leave for free, they'd rather get a fee, even if it's a paltry sum for a player like him, of 25 mill, than lose him for free like they did with Lewandowski. Also, I bet they are sick of this saga that's been hanging over the team, anybody with a brain knows that he wants to leave at the end of the year, and it's best for them to move on from him and start thinking about the future. 

And as for Madrid, they'll just rotate their starters, they are shifting towards the 4-4-2, where Reus would almost certainly be penciled in on the left wing. He won't sit on the bench, they'll rotate all their attacking players like Isco, James, Bale, Benzema etc. based on opponent, form, and whatnot, and Ancelotti really hasn't changed their starting 11 because other than Varane, they have no world class players on their bench. Injuries happen btw, Modric got a 3-month injury and that's why it was so important that they had a guy like Isco who could come in and they haven't lost a step. And look at Bayern, they bought Alonso and Rode this year when they already had Schweinsteiger and Lahm as DMs, and yet those guys have played a huge parts in their success this year, same with Bernat, who was supposed to be a backup for Alaba. 

Also, from their standpoint, they just see it as a good business move, getting a player of Reus's caliber for only 25 million? That's a freaking steal. And you ask why *he* would want to play at Real? Money, and exposure, and grandeur. Real can offer him probably more money than any other team, and they'll almost certainly win titles year after year in the near future. It would be so fucking phenomenal for him to come here, but we are not on the same level as a Bayern, and not even close to Madrid.

It was actually pretty good.

I mean, the plot isn't all that gripping but she actually holds it together on acting chops alone. I already knew she could act from GoT, but her putting on an entire movie by herself is quite the achievement. I'm impressed.

That being said, she does have afew issues: -Her ""heartfelt confession"" and ""Epiphany"" scenes she depicts through speaking slowly, leaving long pauses inbetween lines and having a look on her face that conveys a sort of quiet acceptance of the situation. It's not bad, it's just the scenes are long and she holds that state the ENTIRE time. It grows tedious and unrealistic. People in tense situations have unstable emotions and can/will change behavior unexpectedly. It's just as much a problem with the director as with the actress in this case however.

-The close-up crying scene is hollywood (not an american production, i know) crying at it's finest. She tries to relieve it abit with some facial movement but it doesn't work.

None the less, well done.

There have been no studies on your assertion, so parsimoniously we should assume the null hypothesis.

Basically, scientifically speaking, if you want to claim that this school is going to have some major effect on people's attitudes somehow, the burden of truth is on you.

The CBT really is designed for people who've never sat on a bike before. It's literally a ""this is a throttle"" at the start.
I had a number of lessons on a 125 before onto a 650cc, and then did my tests.

Get your CBT even before you get a bike [they will provide one for you to use]. And while I'd recommend having your own nicely fitting helmet and gloves for it, I'd also recommend *not* - just in case you don't enjoy the experience at all.

Once you have your CBT, what you do next depends on your goals.  
If you're just commuting without any motorways or national speed limit dual carriageways, and you have the cash, get a couple more lessons and get a 125cc. They're fantastic on fuel, and nice and light to get round traffic.  
Rack up a bit of experience on it, then go for your DAS.  
When you sell on the 125, you'll barely lose any money [provided you bought it second hand], because they're so high demand that they hold their value brilliantly.

If you have long journeys planned, or need to do motorways, then look to get your full license as soon as you can

As for why you see lots of 125s in flairs? They're fantastic commuting bikes, as said. Really cheap to run, and hold up nicely.  
I'm just waiting for the better weather to get a bigger bike, personally.

To note: on a CBT, you are limited to a 125cc bike, you can't get higher.

&gt; But I probably won't buy one just because I think it looks coolest.

Sounds like a very good reason to get a bike to me...  
But don't rush into buying a bike.

What about returning to the 4-1-2-1-2 that worked so well last season? I would be interested to see this play out: 

----------Mignolet----------

Can---Skrtel--Sakho---Moreno

------------Lucas--------------- 

---Henderson--Coutinho------

-----------Lallana--------------

-----Sterling---Sturridge------

 .
  
Reasons being: 

1. Sterling now has experience acting as striker, and having Sturridge and Sterling making runs would be perfect for Coutinho or Henderson to slide balls through.
2. Lucas has been doing great in defence. Last year, Steven Gerrard worked in that role, but with our shaky centre-backs, I think we need a more solidly defensive player there.
3. I think Can could be great at Right-Back. He can clearly defend, and yet he also knows how to play it out of defence.
4. Last season, Henderson and Coutinho played extremely well on the flanks of a diamond. I think they could succeed there again (with the right movement from our strikers).
5. Lallana has been our best creative outlet this season. Let him flourish in the no. 10 position.

It quite crazy that some fans on /r/soccer think they are way up there with likes of Real and Man U. Us and them, we are on bar. If Chelsea is back to winning ways, then who is to say we won't surpass them. Now that Bundesliga is one of three best leagues in the world they are competing with other big foreign teams for the other good players in their league. They were the only ones who have been poaching the best players from Germany and other big teams had their eyes on better players from other Leagues at that time. How many star players went to Bayern 4 years ago when other big teams were after them? They made great business in signing players like Robben after he became Real reject. And Ribery at that time he wasn't even on the radar of other big teams. For fuck sake, we had chance to buy him but we thought Malouda was a better player than him.  In Reus case, it is 2015. It is not like his contract ends this summer. Dortmund have time to decide where to send him and they would definitely not sell him to Bayern. We can spend upwards of 30M, if there are some other big bidders. Bayern rarely spend big. It would be between Chelsea and Real, that is if Real happen to be after another attacking player. Real have players who are even more talented than Reus, there is no way he can be a guarantee starter. You can't just rotate big stars like that, they will be forced to sell another good player just like Di Maria. Of all the money they spent recently who do you honestly think will be in the starting line-up? The likes of Isco and James Rodriguez are younger than Reus. They are also not injury prone like Rues and they are seen as the future of that team. Bale is the hire to throne, he is the main attacking player after Ronaldo. No way he ends up on the bench. You mentioned Alonso going to Bayern, but look at his age. And Rode is seen as the future replacement for Schweinsteiger and his contract was up.

null,false,jbungels132,null,null,null,"&gt;The answer is actually pretty simple for me. I'd buy a striker now, put Paulinho in rotation for the attacking mid spot, and leave Soldado as third choice for both spots. 

How do you plan to afford this? Nobody has been sold, and unless we buy a very young, underrated striker their fee+wages are going to be a rather large burden. Why would you want our record signing to be behind another one of our top earners, who is a backup himself?
If rumors are to be believed, Pauli is either temporarily or permanently on his way to Italy. This would allow us to afford the new striker, and using Bobby at CAM means that his money/talent is mostly wasted.

&gt;This sort of reaction is all based on ""he got two assists"" in all honesty. Are we going to put Paulinho in the pivot because he did well centrally? 

You're right, the idea to use him as a CAM is pretty new. However, his effect to the build up play has been noted since preseason, and after realizing he won't be scoring much, moving him to somewhere that will suit his strengths is good, logical decision. Hopefully Paulinho will leave this window so we can buy a striker and making this irrelevant.


&gt;Still haven't addressed my point on the goals, actually. 

He's not exactly been in form for us, so he can really only get better. Playing to his strengths is exactly how that will happen, not benching him until he leaves in shame, so if Paulinho leaves we should do this to try to make the best of a bad situation. Again, the purpose of him leaving is to fund the aquisition of another striker.  Although competetion on all fronts will be imrpoving, they still won't be on the level of the PL, and this is a way to make sure Eriksen doesn't kill himself by February while being able to test out the theory.

In this case it isn't because the government think that LGBT people are inferior and therefore should not share the same educational resources as non-LGBT students, but rather an LGBT charity setting up an institution to support LGBT people during one of the most difficult phases of their lives. It's not even proper segregation, as non-LGBT students are able to attend! We separate SEN students not because they are inferior, but because mainstream education isn't suited to their educational needs, in the same way mainstream education is not currently suited to the needs of LGBT students. It isn't just about bullying - staff aren't very well equipped to deal with issues that LGBT issues face. It would be all nice and good to change the system so that separate school's aren't necessary, but that would mean:

* a more robust and effective anti-bullying procedure, that many schools either don't have or don't enforce enough
* a better and inclusive pastoral care programme
* better mental health support
* development of the PSHE programme that would cover LGBT topics at some point
* development of sex and relationships education to include LGBT topics

...and this would ideally be implemented in all schools across the country in order to be beneficial to as many students as possible. In reality I don't see this happening for a while - sex and relationships education isn't actually compulsory and when it is delivered it is limited from the heterosexual point of view, and doesn't actually mention LGBT topics at all. LGBT students are at higher risk of mental illness and yet [spending on mental health services for young people has fallen since 2010.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30735370) 

Integration is great and all, but the reality is that mainstream education just isn't for LGBT students at the moment. It isn't just about bullying (although that is a huge thing), and the changes necessary to make mainstream education better for LGBT students won't happen for a while. I think many young LGBT people (myself included) would much prefer to go to a specialist school that was equipped to support us in an accepting environment.

null,false,goingdownhillfast,null,null,null,"&gt; Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, Scotland’s top prosecutor, has confirmed that the force has been “instructed to request and consider the unredacted version” of the US Senate study.

SNP MSP Kevin Stewart urged the US authorities to co-operate fully with Police Scotland and “hand over an unadulterated copy”.

The police launched an inquiry in 2013 after the Press and Journal revealed new evidence that CIA planes had used Inverness, Aberdeen and Wick airports during the operations.

The P&amp;J had contacted British academics investigating the illegal detention, transfer and torture of terror suspects, and asked them to review flight data at the three airports.

The researchers subsequently found “conclusive” proof that five rendition flights landed at both Inverness and Wick, with a further three at Aberdeen International Airport.

Last month, a controversial US Senate report confirmed that the CIA carried out “brutal” interrogations of al-Qaeda suspects in the years after the 9/11 attacks.

Amid ongoing questions over Britain’s involvement, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of Westminster’s intelligence and security committee, promised to request secret material relating to the UK that was redacted from the study.

Mr Mulholland, who last month asked the police in Scotland to review the report, has now confirmed that officers had been told to request the uncensored version.

In a letter to Mr Stewart, he said: “I can confirm that Police Scotland have been instructed to request and consider the unredacted version of the US Senate Select Committee’s study in to the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation programme as part of the ongoing investigation in to rendition flights in Scotland.”

Mr Stewart, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Central, welcomed the move.

“I am pleased that the police have been instructed to seek an unredacted copy of the US Senate Committee’s report,” he said.

“In my opinion this shows that Scottish authorities are continuing to try to get to the truth about allegations of our airports being used illegally for the rendition flights of the US intelligence agencies.

“I would urge the United States’ authorities to co-operate fully with Police Scotland and hand over an unadulterated copy of the report so that our police can carry out a comprehensive investigation into these matters.”

Data relating to the use of UK airports by the CIA was gathered by Sam Raphael from Kingston University, and Ruth Blakeley of Kent University, as part of a three year study called the Rendition Project.

After being contacted by the Press and Journal, they found seven of the planes which landed in northern Scotland were operated by firms accused of being CIA fronts, while another three were by a real company alleged to have links to rendition.

The researchers also discovered an aircraft which landed at Wick in 2004 had been “logged flying to secret prison and torture destinations”.

Two other planes which stopped at Wick in 2003 later landed in Jordan, a state alleged to have been used by the US for interrogation. A flight that landed in Aberdeen in 2005 went on to Romania – a state alleged in a European Parliament inquiry to have been complicit in rendition.

Black people were stopped and searched for drugs at 6.3 times the rate of white people, while Asian people were stopped and searched for drugs at 2.5 times the rate and those identifying as mixed race were stopped and searched for drugs at twice the rate of white people. This is despite the fact that drug use is lower amongst  black and Asian people when compared to their white counterparts .

&gt;Black people are subject to court proceedings for drug possession offences at 4.5 times the rate of whites, are found guilty of this offence at 4.5 times the rate, and are subject to immediate custody at 5 times the rate of white people.

I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread that I don't agree with the full-time aspect of this school. The part time aspect and the extra support are great and should be focussed on, rather than possibly wasting what little available funds they have on making 40 places available for full time students, which may not even be taken up.

&gt;LGBT students get next to no sex ed. 
Many straight students don't either and you admit that. I'm not sure why that really factors the need for a special school. You're pretty much admitting that ALL students need better sex ed. 

I got told about the reproductive system from a biological point of view and that was it.

&gt;and are at higher risk of suicide and mental illness, which are issues that will require more than a handful of specialist charities to fix.

And yet you've mentioned elsewhere that mental health spending is down across the board. Assuming that some of that spending would be diverted to schools, is it cost effective? Is it fair?

Again, I'm going to make assumptions, but opening a school surely must cost more money than aiming to improve existing services, which you can argue are somehow inaccessible for these people, but how accessible is the school?

Danny Ings is out there, isn't he? Destro is going to Milan with an option to buy, and there are so many deals like that if Levy wanted to, we could probably get on a deal like that. I don't really want a Lewandoski or a Suarez, I don't even want an Ings, but that position needs to be taken care of this month. If Kane gets injured we're fucked. 

&gt;Why would you want our record signing to be behind another one of our top earners, who is a backup himself? 

Because he's out of form and not doing his job well. That and he's already on the bench. We bench Paulinho and Chiriches based on pecking order, don't we?

And yes, we should abandon the idea that he'll come good for us. Soldado is the classic flop in action, really. 

&gt;You're right, the idea to use him as a CAM is pretty new.

The idea itself is new, but the idea of using a non-scoring striker isn't. 

Somebody said during the Chicago game in preseason that was hard to forget- *""Soldado as a sort of false 9 up front to make room for Eriksen, Chadli and Lamela would work wonders this season.""*

We're here six months later trying to force him into the lineup. 

And you do realize that being a midfielder period is a ton of work for a Poch player, right? Eriksen has only just started looking good. Before that, he was running up and down the pitch fixing his defensive game while we were wondering if last season was a flash in the pan. So no, it wouln't ""make sense"" to try to make this happen. I swear, Chelsea fans must've gone along with the same rationale while Torres was scoring half a goal or season or whatever for them.  

Playing Paulinho, someone who's already used to covering a lot of distance in matches and coming in with a goal from deep (no matter how inconsistently or infrequently) makes much more sense. 

&gt;He's not exactly been in form for us, so he can really only get better. 

Ahahahahahahahaha. 

Or we could realize that this was a game where Burnley didn't take the match too seriously and were okay with exiting. Not all too different to winning against Newcastle in the cup, considering that their first and second choice keepers were out of that as well. Burnley in the FA Cup tells us more about Soldado's goal scoring abilities than his ability to create. 

&gt;the best of a bad situation.

I'm not a Balotelli apologist, but he wasn't brought in to be a lone striker, and neither was Lambert. I'd like to see both of them paired with a healthy Sturridge for the rest of the season before we clang the gavel on their future with the club. I think Mario's positioning and awareness are good, and he can turn on the speed in brief stints to make a necessary run...I think he'll play very well off other high pressing players like Sturridge (and Markovic, who seems to be settling well enough now). 

He's been very unlucky to not score at least 4 or 5 more goals this season...I know that's not a ton of clear chances for a big signing, but injuries and the state of the team are at least partially to blame. If he can settle in with a healthy Sturridge to play off of, I think he'll start banging them in. I think of him a bit like a not-so-clever Berbatov, whose ambling and casual style was occasionally mistaken for outright laziness...but when he was in scoring form and had high motor players pressing around him, he seemed to be in the right place at the right time for a lot of easy goals, and even managed to score a few absolutely spectacular ones from time to time.

They've been given £63,000. I don't know what they already receive in terms of funding, but is it going to cover the costs of running a school that actually provides a proper education on top of the the extra support and environment it will supposedly create?

The Cumberland, as above. Old-fashioned, no TV screens or music, open fire, good lunches (try the sticky toffee pudding), dog-friendly, lovely beer garden. Good if you like real ales.
The Wally Dug - Like the Cumberland but smaller. 
Circle Bar - Quite funky and hipsterish. Does an excellent all-day breakfast. 
The Ox - A good selection of spirits, chilled vibe, dog-friendly. The best Sunday roast in town, but make sure you reserve a table. 
The Barony - Another old-fashioned pub for spending an afternoon or evening drinking pints. 
Khushi's - Not a pub but an excellent Indian restaurant, getting a mention because it's on Broughton Street and OP, you say you like restaurants. 

Broughton is the area sandwiched between the east side of the New Town and the top of Leith Walk. It's not a bad place to stay - really handy for the city centre (ten minutes from Waverley Station, the bus station, the airport bus terminus and the tram terminus, about fifteen minutes from the Royal Mile), and well-placed for exploring areas like Leith, Stockbridge and the Botanics.

The release clause is set at a paltry 25 million euros, Dortmund has tried to get him to sign a new contract so they could get a higher release clause, but he isn't going for that because he's leaving at the end of this year. 

Yes, Bayern may have only hit their ceiling in the last 4 years, but the amount of world class players there are insane. They have the best GK in the world in Neuer. They have the best left back in the world in Alaba. They have probably the center back who is playing the best in the world at the moment in Boateng. They have 3 of the top 5 DM's in the world with Alonso, Schweinsteiger, and Lahm, who was the best RB in the world. They probably have the best combo of wings in the world with Ribery, Robben, and Muller. They are a better team than us, that's a fact. Reus's main objective is to win trophies, he doesn't give a fuck where or how, and the 2 best places to do that are at Real and Bayern. The appeal of Bayern is that he would get to win trophies that he hasn't won with Dortmund, like the DFB-Pokal and the Bundesliga, as Dortmund won both before he got there, and he gets to stay in his home country. And I don't need to begin about the appeal of Madrid. 

TL;DR Bayern and Madrid are head and shoulders above us at the moment and there is no argument to be made against that. There is nobody outside of this subreddit that actually believes in the slightest chance that he is coming here instead of Bayern or Madrid. Bayern gives him a chance to win titles in his home country, titles he wasn't able to win with Dortmund. Real offers him the chance to win titles, get massive exposure, and he'll be paid handsomely. Just go onto /r/soccer or and read that whole thread about Reus to Madrid and why it doesn't matter that they have an insanely stacked team to either Reus or Madrid.

But, they forget something important. When they watched it as a kid, it was with a child's eyes. If you'd first seen the original Thunderbird's as an adult, you'd never have dreamed it could have been so successful. Visible strings, can't walk, interposed hands and disproportionate body parts made for a completely unbelievable visual experience. But, a child's eyes overlook all those technicalities and simply become engrossed in the story. As a child, of course I knew they were all models; but that was all part of the experience. I wanted to make my airfix models just as good. I wanted bomb bays that opened automatically, hidden doors, couches that became people movers. It was all magic and exciting in what was then a fairly technology sparse domestic setting (we had a transistor radio and that was the only semiconductor in the house) and I'm sure many of you were the same.

It always struck me that interviews with Gerry Anderson and any of the other creators share a common theme; their surprise that they're still known for these programmes so many years later and a quiet embarrassment that as an adult they were playing with models instead of doing a ""grown up"" job. Gerry Anderson is on record as saying he really wanted to be an adult filmmaker and puppets were just a means to an end. But again, they never saw it through adult eyes and could never really enjoy the same experience that we had as children and I think that's important.

Now, as an adult, I'm a systems engineer. I enjoy my work and even after thirty years still find pleasure in technology and its implementation. It'd be hard for me to say that Thunderbirds actually planted that idea in my head as a child but I'm pretty sure it certainly had a strong influence. I don't know whether this reboot will be as big a hit as the original Thunderbirds. I think it has a challenge ahead because there's so much other material around now but, regardless, I hope that at least some kids get as much pleasure from it as I did when I first watched TB2 running out on the runway to Barry Grays imposing kettle drum theme music.

The notion of abolishing one size fits all education is wonderful. It is not currently realistic.

&gt;We separate SEN students not because they are inferior, but because mainstream education isn't suited to their educational needs, in the same way mainstream education is not currently suited to the needs of LGBT students.

For one, please don't use that to further your point. LGBT and SEN should not be comparable. SEN involves physical and mental disabilities and learning difficulties as well. LGBT does not. SEN is, in fact, a 'one size fits all' term. It covers a huge range of things.

You might cite higher rates of mental health problems in young people in the LGBT community but we're pushing towards ensuring that people with mental health issues aren't treated as inferior either right?

SEN segregation happens in different ways. Mainstream schools are required to cater for SEN to a certain extent. In many schools this involves a separate class/lessons but with an element of mixing with the mainstream students.

Specialist SEN schools in theory would cater for a specific special need but in practice, this doesn't happen and an element of 'one size fits all' comes into play. 

I live in Greater London as well and my brother has Down's Syndrome.  He currently goes to a specialist school (the choice was severely limited) which caters to a number of different types of special need with a limited number of staff and a limited budget. It's pretty one size fits all, as was every other school available to him.

Which most likely won't be Bayern. They don't do business that way. You can't be sure of anything in football until papers are signed. The same thing was said when Man U, City and other clubs were after Hazard. For all we know, Reus might even go to Man U. We can compete with any team in the world when it comes to this. Also saying Bayern has world class players as if we don't have them. Just look at Chelsea starting 11. We have the 2nd best goalkeeper in the world and he is only 22 years of age. He is not that far from Neuer. Don't make it seem like he is out of this world as a goalkeeper. Neuer is getting praises for his tackles and whatnot. Courtois also had an amazing season with Atletico winning La Liga against all odds and taking his team to the UCL finals. If this wasn't a world cup year, he would have been the better goalkeeper. Also Neuer was playing for the best team in his League in front of the best defenders in his league. If he was out of this world he would have performed better in UCL last season. Saying they have best LB in the world is just your opinion. We have Azpilicueta and Luis. There is no team in the world that have two of the best LBs. Luis was the best LB in the world and Dave had a better season than Alaba. We also have the best DM and the best midfielder in the world at the moment(Cesc). We have better striker than them. Also Hazard is showing all the signs that he would surpass the likes of Robben and Ribery. Our team is filled with young talented players who would be among the very best in their positions. Our future looks bright than theirs. The likes of Schweinsteiger, Ribery and Lahm haven't been playing at their best. From now on wards it will be downhill slope while our players are reaching new heights. Next year, it would be Hazard who would be among the very best in the world.

I'd say they look much better than the Thunderbirds image and similar to their original counterparts, and unbelievably bearable save the incessant Welsh accents!). Anyway, my partner put on one of the old episodes of Thomas with the stop motion toys, and it was about an engine who was afraid of rain and hid in a tunnel to keep his new paint job dry. They tried to coax and then force him out but he just wouldn't budge... and so, as punishment, the Fat Controller had the workmen take up the track and build a wall over the entrance of the tunnel, with a gap so he could see out. The other engines passed him every day and one of them would say, ""Hello,"" and the other would say, ""Serves you right."" I waited for the resolution at the end, but no. It ended with a still of that train, eyes peering from the darkness, staring glumly down the rail line as the narrator reasoned: ""I think he deserved his punishment, don't you?"" Roll credits.

But I still believe that there is a nature of things,  which is completely independent of man-made deviations and any democracy of opinions.  If man-made democracy was dedicated to find that true nature,  things like blasphemy would be frowned upon.


Because democratic freedom doesn't discern good or evil.  So it can only go so far.  In other words there are two definitions of 'freedom';
the man-made ""democratic one"" is: ""freedom to do whatever the fuck I want"",  and the second,  which would be the one associated with natural virtue and ""salvation"" is: being free from evil.  That one isn't blind.
That would also be the religious definition of freedom,  **when it's not corrupted**,  and thus also the only one that can suffer blasphemy.  

Americans boast the loudest about their 'freedoms', but the overwhelming majority of them are deeply enslaved by the greed of the .1%.  If people sought freedom through virtue and salvation instead of the morally leveling ""whatever the fuck I want"" type of freedom,  the psychopaths would be long gone from leadership and the new leaders would instead become as good as the people's principles....

We haven't had a large group of youngsters this good in a long time. The ones we gave opportunity few years back have turned out to be rubbish. Good examples, are Josh McEachran and Kakuta. I really had high hopes for these two alongside Bruma. The problem is you never know how good they are unless you see them train everyday. The manager sees their potential, if they were ready or that good, i am sure he would have played them by now. Look Zouma, he is playing because Jose sees something in him. The lad is only 20 years old, almost the same age as most of our youngsters. He is even younger than some on loan. Btw, of all the youngsters with us(not those on loan. They are better off over there) who do you want to get a playing time? RLC? Matic, Mikel, Ramires are still ahead of him. We need the squad players to get a playing time before the youngsters when the main starters are resting. Boga? Well, he is still very raw and untested. The matches we were up by 2 or more, we never knew we would be up. You are never sure how EPL match will turn out. A relegation bound team might upset the league leaders. This do happen almost every season. Manager has to play the best 11 possible and have the strongest bench. When a team can win the league by 3 or 1 points, you don't take risk like that. No one knew Salah would be this bad. Maybe, he isn't even that bad but just well below Chelsea quality. He can be a starter for a lot of teams in the League. The problem with our fans is that they underestimate how good you have to be to play for a team like Chelsea. Every season, we expect the manager to play the youngsters. Are Real and Bayern playing their youngsters? Teams like Man U are doing it out of necessity, so are the other mid tables teams. Even Wenger of all people, has been avoiding youngsters lately.

I think you are contradicted yourself here mate. In the exact thread that was posted here the day Mourinho said this I wrote a comment outlining why I thought he was wrong and that Salah just was not anywhere near the level for him to have a breakout season. In fact, I believed he would be lucky to even play on a semi-regular basis.

I hate how people here use this stupid excuse about ""you think you know more than Mourinho?"". Just because he is Mourinho doesn't make every thing or action he makes correct. And he was obviously wrong in this instance. When David Cameron makes a statement or a decision and you disagree should you be constantly told ""You think you know more than Cameron?"". Its an excuse people use when they have nothing else to say.

Also, on Salah's record. It really wasn't anything impressive. He wasn't even that prolific of a player for *Swiss* standards let alone the Premier League. In all his time at Basel in 78 apps he only scored 20 goals. For an attacking player who plays in a pretty poor league that is not even close to Chelsea quality. The only reason people on here even said that he had ""potential"" is because of the goals he scored against us. Which should never be the sole reason you believe a player is worth buying. If he didn't score against us I can't imagine too many people on here would have hyped him up the way that they did.

 My issue is what do you propose we do instead.  I do not think there are any wingers good enough to go after and I do not think we should go out of way to buy another squad rotation player. 

And to your Wenger point, he has mostly been playing youngsters out of necessity. They should have bought another defender but they have had injuries at every position.

Yes please, but we all know Levy has a hard time spending without also getting a return, so somebody would have to leave. Currently, we'd get much more for Paulinho than Soldado (in relation to what we got them for), so it makes more sense for him to leave.

&gt;&gt;Why would you want our record signing to be behind another one of our top earners, who is a backup himself? 

&gt;We bench Paulinho and Chiriches based on pecking order, don't we?

Again, Paulinho is probably leaving.

&gt;And yes, we should abandon the idea that he'll come good for us. Soldado is the classic flop in action, really. 

As a goal scoring striker, yes, but again, the point of this is not to use him to score goals, but to set up goals for whomever it is we buy. 

&gt;Somebody said during the Chicago game in preseason that was hard to forget- *""Soldado as a sort of false 9 up front to make room for Eriksen, Chadli and Lamela would work wonders this season.""*

&gt;We're here six months later trying to force him into the lineup. 

This idea was never really tried, so I don't understand it's relevance here.

&gt;And you do realize that being a midfielder period is a ton of work for a Poch player, right? 

If he played as a false 9 like you pointed out above, he wouldn't have to. Either way though, the entire teams' fitness level has risen along with Eriksen's, so why wouldn't Soldado be in better shape as well? Kane covers more distance than anyone, and that's clearly what Poch wants in a striker.  Would it not then make sense that, as Kane's backup, he'd be training to run similar amounts? 

&gt;Playing Paulinho, someone who's already used to covering a lot of distance in matches and coming in with a goal from deep (no matter how inconsistently or infrequently) makes much more sense. 

This is what I'd like to see happen too, but it's much, much more likely that Pauli leaves, so it makes more sense to try and raise Soldado's value by finding a practical use for him.

&gt;&gt;the best of a bad situation.

&gt;The best of a bad situation would be to cut our ties with Soldado as soon as possible and bringing in Pritchard or something (doubt that's possible) so he can get half a season's worth of experience under his belt.

Levy won't be very likely to sell him at this much of a lose, which again is why it makes sense to raise his value and then bring in either Pritchard or somebody else early in the summer and offloading Soldado at the same time.

Interesting. I'm on DLA and I'm allowed to work. I have worked on numerous occasions since my award. I have a friend who works full time and is on DLA, again totally allowed.

They might lop a little bit off if you work, but the payments are for your care and such. Needs that don't magically go away when you get a job.

Now other benefits, such as JSA and ESA, are different. They are specifically out of work benefits, and rely on you being out of work in order to qualify.

I, too, am disgusted by the the readiness of the media to come down on people for being on benefits. There are rigorous checks in place to ensure only people who qualify for the benefits get them. If these women qualify, that's up to the DWP to decide, and they clearly have decided these women qualify. I qualify on the basis of several mental health conditions, including an autism spectrum disorder. In terms of physical capability, I am healthy. In terms of intellect, I can be described as *better* than most people. In terms of getting by day-to-day with my own life in a world full of other people, however... that's where my disabilities become apparent.

I could forgive a person for looking down at me for collecting disability payments, since I appear to be a fit and healthy, approaching genius level, geeky dude who a lot of people would be envious of for my unique view on life. However, that does not change the fact that there are plenty of things normal people find easy that I struggle immensely with, and it's particularly telling that I am regarded as a ""vulnerable adult"" for this.

Ever since my 5-way diagnosis in 2009, I have been locked in a series of questions. What is normal, and how far do I deviate from it? Are there yet more areas in my life where I struggle, beyond the lengthy list my psychologist had to point out to me one by one, since I was actually unaware that my perception of 'functional' was different from a questionnaire's unrevealed expectations of the same?

If anything, questioning myself (constantly, incessantly and deeply) has made me deeply cynical and untrusting. This seems to create more issues than the rather important one it helped to solve. While I don't often sleep at night, resorting to a nocturnal existence as a result, I'm far less likely to find trouble now, since I am much more naturally suspicious and avoidant. Before, I thought I was 'just shy'. Now I know I have reasons for not liking being in crowds. It has allowed me to cast aside the 'get over it' or 'grow out of it' mentality, and instead accept that social phobia isn't something you can just face down and overcome, it's something that gets ever worse with bad experiences. Bad experiences can be avoided, while good experiences can be sought out for the purposes of helping the situation. For example, no longer trying to walk boldly into a big crowd of people and ending up having panic attacks, but instead seeking out persistent social circles and trying to garner peer support, speaking only when ready instead of trying to force it...

I'm an intelligent man, people say. I should have become a doctor or a lawyer, people say. My life is a long line of wasted potentials and disappointment. However, after my diagnoses (plural intentional. I got 5 of them on the same day), I have slowly gained ground on identifying my problems and trying to find, not solutions, but ways to work with them. Despite being fit and well, and suitably intelligent, I feel that DLA has been an undeniable help towards meeting the challenges I face. I never came off JSA during my journey, except when working, even though one of my earliest discoveries was that the Jobcentre was far from helpful, perhaps even being a barrier. My reasoning was the very same... that I am capable of and willing to work. While I could probably get ESA, under the very realistic view that I'm particularly difficult to employ, I don't feel that I need the further barrier of having to seek consent to work instead of being forced/'encouraged' to.

Targets and goals are a difficult thing for me. When I'm not aiming for something, that tends to be the time I find it. In five years time I see myself where I was five years ago, even though I know I will have progressed much further than I already have. In the past two years alone, without aims, targets and goals, I have taken part in a theatre production, lighting a stage play, been part of a skill sharing committee organising young people to reach achievements, and currently helping out with a charity, setting up a linux-based network for their centre out in Surrey. In truth, my list of achievements since 2009 is long, and getting ever longer, and it's all part of a steady journey towards finally realising something bigger and better than my past life.

I've come a long way, and being on disability has given me that. I look like I'm just a lazy waster, sponging off the state when I'm totally fine. The story underneath is the opposite. I am instead constantly improving myself, and growing as a man, in receipt of money I am genuinely entitled to, and far from 'fine'.

I could tell all of that to the Daily Mail, The Sun or the Telegraph, but I know what story their eventual article would tell, and it would not be a story of growth and personal achievements. it would be another in a inexhaustible line of damning articles about how scumbags are stealing tax money to live like lords. I know that, if I were to read such an article about me, the undoing of years of self-esteem building and slow progress would not only be words printed on a page, but also my reality. I refuse to allow that to happen, because I doubt I would have enough time or strength left to waste another 6 years rebuilding. Especially since I have been continuously denying myself the other option that has often entered my mind.

I have a long way to go before I'll be 'fine'. I don't know if I'll make it, but I'll carry on, a step at a time. I will probably never be without difficulty (especially since I'm such a misfit, and almost being a hermit doesn't help with that), but I can probably get around my social phobia the way I have been going. I can probably fight off depression if I make enough successes out of my life that I can say I have a decent one. Becoming a cynical bastard has helped me avoid people enough that the whole question of 'not fitting in' is irrelevant, though I'd probably be better off focusing on adapting to society rather than adapting my life to cut society out. I suppose it's really about returns, there. Letting people in means letting people take advantage, which can lead to a world of bad experiences.

I will never not be autistic. The rest, however, is pretty negotiable. OCD can be a good thing. Staying up all night thinking. Sitting around all afternoon, watching. Watching people. Watching the world go by. Watching everyone who is much better at life than me go about being so. Those few sentences shaped my thoughts for a whole week of sleepless nights, and the result was I decided that my career-to-be was in the security industry. This was in Summer 2012, right after my short term zero-hours Olympics job screeched to a halt and I no longer had hours of work to declare to the Jobcentre (I wasn't getting enough work to fully come off JSA anyway). What happened was I used some of my DLA money to take courses, and now I'm licensed for CCTV work and Door Supervision. My next step is to find a relevant job that doesn't require experience. In a CCTV booth, there are no crowds, no customer service that I'm atrociously bad at, no distractions. Just thinking, watching, taking notes. The ideal vacancy would involve unsociable hours, so I can put those sleepless nights to good use.

My story before diagnoses and DLA was one of despair, frustration and forever going nowhere. My story after diagnoses and with the help of DLA is one of moving forward, progress and taking steps towards a brighter future, whatever that may be.

I'm sorry for posting my life story in response to your comment, but I got thinking about it, and my honest opinion is that, while it's not directly relevant, there's something or other in there that may be helpful to other people in the thread, if not you personally. I don't claim to be nor want to be a saint, a sinner, a scoundrel, a striver or a shirker. All I know is that I'm not a statistic.

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"You clearly know nothing about nutrition either. Otherwise you'd be talking about nutrition instead of energy.

I know plenty about energy. I'm hardly a doctor, though. What you say is true about the 500 calories (kcal, a unit of energy). What you miss, however, is that there's an end point. There is a point where continually plundering your body's fat reserves is the least healthy thing you can do.

This is a totally different subject from that of nutrition. Malnutrition, however, is a much larger and more complex issue than energy storage. This is where many armchair dieticians go wrong. By looking at a person's size and weight, we get a rough estimate of how much energy is stored in their body. We know nothing about the nutritional makeup of the food they eat. I am a skinny little guy, yet I can guarantee my frequent visits to the burger shop and love of coffee leave me far less healthy than the great lumbering tank of a man I pass in the street who has lots of veg and salads with his huge pork joints at home, freshly cooked. He may be three times my size, with a belly that I could hide in, but his nutritional intake is far more superiorly balanced than mine.

Eating properly and weight are unrelated. The inverse correlation of the two comes from the nutritional quality of foods, as opposed to energy content. Too much fat will kill you. That's nothing to do with health, but more to do with physics. Weight puts pressure on bones, thick fat deposits put pressure on organs. Organs suffer from that. However, even if your walking is laboured and your intestines are cramped, you can still be healthier than someone who has none of those issues, but lacks adequate sources of essential nutrients.

That's not rocket science. There was no mention of periapses or long winded exploration of the equations involved in comparing the delta-v of a 15 ton container along a vector perpendicular to vertical in relation to a planetary surface against the required delta-v for a successful orbital transfer. What it is, however, is an observation that 'healthy' is a highly subjective thing.

Ah okay, you seemed to have completely disregard the idea that Soldado would be backup anything at best and have now promoted him straight to starter! Fantastic! 

Without going headfirst into the fitness issues, putting Soldado at forward creates new headaches. Kane, Eriksen and Chadli are all undroppable on current form right now, and Lamela has to find his feet before we can say whether or not he's been a success, but I guess he has some competition with in-form Townsend. So out of those four (and Townsend, if he continues to make leaps and bounds with development), who do we drop to accommodate Soldado? The formation we play at that point wouldn't even be relevant, because all of them couldn't possibly play without stepping on each others' toes. 

&gt;Either way though, the entire teams' fitness level has risen along with Eriksen's, so why wouldn't Soldado be in better shape as well?

No offense, but it goes past just fitness. 

Because Kane started life as a striker but was tried at midfield in his youth, he knows the duty of tracking back, making a rash tackle, etc. Soldado's Everton goal is case in point of something that he himself couldn't set up. That goal was at least 50% Kane. 

Soldado likely has a style of play already burned into his head, doesn't he? He's pushing thirty now and it's unrealistic to expect the lung-busting runs that Kane or Eriksen does commonly nowadays.

Don't know if you've seen the Swansea game from this season either, but the difference between Kane absolutely gulfs Soldado in terms of everything. He had better positioning, movement, created more chances in a game that didn't have too many, where Soldado just looked finished, tired of trying. If we're comparing the two, Soldado probably has the footballing brain that Kane seems to have, but not the same intensity or desire. And who can blame him, in all honesty. 

&gt;If he played as a false 9 like you pointed out above, he wouldn't have to.

Everybody has to track back under Poch. Why is Soldado excluded, especially if he's tasked with one of the more athletic positions? 

&gt;As a goal scoring striker, yes, but again, the point of this is not to use him to score goals, but to set up goals for whomever it is we buy.

Completely obscene. We're basing his ""muh creator"" status off of a game against a relegation candidate's second team and preseason against sides that would find themselves in trouble in the Championship. What has he done to earn a billionth chance? Why is he worth keeping around, besides Levy's ego or frugality?

&gt;which again is why it makes sense to raise his value and then bring in either Pritchard or somebody else early in the summer and offloading Soldado at the same time.

How long have you been watching Spurs? 

I'll say that I haven't been for too long, but in my time,  Darren Bent, Super Pav, Defoe, Crouch, Ade and now Soldado have overstayed their welcome under the premise of ""we have to raise his value before he gets sold"". If Levy's being flexible with Poch, why would any of his past be brought up when we're seeing a big change in how upper management functions?

In all likelihood, his market value is the highest it can be right now: January is a buyer's market, he can still salvage his career in Spain and it still looks like Spurs fucked up on their end buying the wrong type of striker, as opposed to being strictly Soldado's fault. For his sake, and as precedent has it, it's time to let go before he gets to Torres-internet-maymay status.

&gt;Currently, we'd get much more for Paulinho than Soldado (in relation to what we got them for), so it makes more sense for him to leave.

That's a systematic problem within the club. We're never going to have an amazing squad with this attitude. Paulinho's value is higher because he at least has something to offer. Why hold on to the dead weight? 

If Soldado doesn't go in January (would be surprised to see) or at the most, summer, he'll likely be loaned out for the rest of hist contract and be hated for taking up wages and keeping us from rewarding players who are actually doing well. Look at Chelsea and what Hazard's on after Torres left.

You sense the changes that occur more acutely with the people who care the most locally, because they find a way to make it to the game more than not make it. The way the groans become more exasperated, the boos and whistles louder. How the atmosphere becomes quieter and more civil as the ticket and pint prices go up. The loss of tradition as chants or songs fall by the wayside.I know this just in the disparity I feel with fans who aren't season ticket holders to the American football teams I support. I know I'd probably laugh if some foreigner tried to tell me something about the Florida Gators (think Championship if you don't know American football structure). I live 10 minutes from their stadium and have gone to every home game since 1995.  So I understand the reasoning for a protest. Hell, angry fans just got the Gators coach fired, so this is the second run of this for me this season.But. That doesn't mean I can't have a well formulated opinion.With things like football manager and FIFA out there, everyone knows where players are now. Everyone has their idea about what they would do. Which is what makes PL finding guys like Benteke and Westwood that much more impressive. Personally I think he's done a decent job at the helm for three reasons: A: This to me is a Lerner problem. This is why I don't understand the protest. He's trying to sell. He's still spending (albeit a little) as witnessed by the Gil signing and other rumored deals. He could've zipped up the purse strings completely and gambled we'd stay up. Instead we've added Sanchez, Cissoko, Clev's, and now Gil. Lerner can't conjure buyers out of midair, and who can blame someone for trying to sell something for what it's worth?B: Lambert signings have been shrewd based on his constraints. Yeah there has been a few busts. But there are always busts. Everyone he has signed who is still on the roster has basically been had at a bargain except N'Zogs. We've got talent, and we're still super young as a club. Look at a difference a year makes for a young guy like Clark.C: He's actually quite versatile. So many mangers get locked into their system and struggle to adjust. PL has experimented with a variety of lineups in an effort to coax out the best possible results from the players he has, and has now even changed playing style. We know PL isn't going anywhere until Lerner leaves.

I basically talked in depth of why I disagreed with Mourinho and how Salah was never going to breakout next season, nearly 5 paragraphs worth of text. I also ironically enough mentioned how James was one of the best midfielders in the world (before WC hype).

Bonus: Here is a comment from me ***the day*** he signed for Chelsea
http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1w7dgk/salah_move_completed/cezfsgg

&gt; ""He is the next Marin/Moses. He might be fast and a half decent dribbler but he is nowhere near Chelsea first team quality. If he didn't have his pace I doubt we would ever be talking about him. Salah is really just an amazing youth prospect, not anywhere near a starter for Chelsea.

Again downvoted. But this is why I don't delete my comments. Because more of often than not I am correct, whether or not it is a popular opinion on this sub. I don't buy into hype, regardless of what anyone says, including Jose. I judge players off their merit and ability, and it was extremely clear from me at day 1 that Salah just wasn't at the level required for us.

* Take the Tube to King's Cross (almost all the Tube lines go there), and from there take either of the Piccadilly or Victoria lines north to Seven Sisters. From there, buses run to the ground. Or,

* Get to Liverpool Street Station via the Tube (Central, Circle or Hammersmith lines) then take the Overground service to White Hart Lane station (which is just behind the ground). Note also an Oyster Card (Tube card) does not work on the Overground that far out so you have to buy a ticket; and the Liverpool Street Overground station is just north of the Liverpool Street Tube stop, but is clearly signed. 

* Getting out of the area will likely be much worse, so be patient and if you booked the Overground, make sure it was a return ticket--you will still likely have to wait for a second train. If you did the Tube/bus, be prepared to wait a while to get back to Central London. Personally, I've always bitten the bullet and paid the £40 or so to take a cab, when I could find one. 

Once you're there, the Bell &amp; Hare pub just south of the main Spurs Shop on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Park Lane is always good but you need either a club membership card or a home ticket to get in (if you go, push through to the back garden). Find the N17 Club stand for unique ""unofficial"" t-shirts, they are usually right near the High Road/Park Lane junction. Avoid the independent burger stands on Park Lane (I swear they boil the burgers), but the burger vans off the High Road are not bad, relatively speaking. Inside the Lane, the pies are good but nuclear hot so I'd stick with a sausage roll; the Bovril is as expected, as is the Carling. 

Most of all, have fun. I'm very jealous--I flew over four times last season for matches but events have prevented me from going this season.

""The"" economic system is vague. Different countries can still have radically different economic systems. This research had nothing to do with the field of economics, nor investigates such specific blame for any of the problems it is concerned with, so I dont see how this conclusion follows from the research.

It's really sad, and I wish the NHS were able to fund a kind of PT that actually understood enough about her illnesses, instead she will be denied access to swimming pools if she begins to tell them about her complaints as a stroke risk.

By spending some money on advice that we don't really get enough of in school, we could probably save a lot more long term.  I honestly think you will need both a carrot and stick approach with this, but I think it's fair to do so, as it's not good to force funding of peoples poor lifestyles.",null,0,null,1421386791,null,0,false,0,cnqn6f6,null,t3_2sia8j,null,t1_cnqn6f6,null,t1_cnpwst8,null,null,null,1424848244,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;This meta-analysis confirms that – in spite of impact heterogeneity – the average agronomic and economic benefits of GM crops are large and significant. Impacts vary especially by modified crop trait and geographic region. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for IR crops than for HT crops. **Yield and farmer profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.** Recent impact studies used better data and methods than earlier studies, but these improvements in study design did not reduce the estimates of GM crop advantages. Rather, NGO reports and other publications without scientific peer review seem to bias the impact estimates downward. But even with such biased estimates included, mean effects remain sizeable.

&gt;The profit gains of GM crops are 60 percentage points higher in developing countries than in developed countries (column 6). This large difference is due to higher GM yield gains and stronger pesticide cost savings in developing countries. Moreover, most GM crops are not patented in developing countries, so that GM seed prices are lower [19]. 

&gt;On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.

null,false,neonmantis,null,Derby International,null,"CCA (Corrections Corporation of America) is guaranteed a 90 percent occupancy rate at Red Rock, meaning the state will transfer inmates out of state-operated facilities and into the private prison until the minimum occupancy is met.

The guarantee requires a minimum of 450 inmates by the end of the first year, and 900 by the end of the second, but Ryan wants to accelerate the transfer of up to 1,000 inmates in 2014. There also is room to expand to the facility’s capacity.

Arizona will pay CCA $65.43 a day per inmate. Once the contract is fully implemented, the 90 percent occupancy guarantee will result in the company being paid at least $58,887 a day for 900 inmates — nearly $21.5 million a year. The contract is for an initial term of 10 years, with two five-year renewal options upon mutual agreement. Should the contract run 20 years, CCA could make at least $430 million. Ownership of the facility would transfer to the state after 20 years.

Liverpool have been a tournament team for a fair while now. You don't need to be playing league winning football in order to win the europa league. The europa league is *far* more realistic (and still not really something I would put my money on).

---
&gt;The Doctor is among thousands of ships orbiting a planet after hearing a message being broadcast from it, a three-toned message that no-one can understand. Shrouded in a cape the Doctor visits a ship while holding a Dalek [eyestalk](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek_Eyestalk) to show his bravery, and that he comes in peace. Unfortunately, the ship belongs to Daleks, who fire at him until he teleports back to [the TARDIS](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_TARDIS), where a disembodied Cyberman head that he calls ""[Handles](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Handles)"" is plugged into the console. Surly after avoiding a near disaster, the Doctor removes his cape and scolds Handles for sending him to a Dalek ship while he was ""holding a broken bit of Dalek"". Handles, who interprets everything literally as a robot head, replies he didn't specify a preference for transport.

They had stones and eggs thrown at them by ""30 or 40"" men, yet there are no pictures of the car afterwards as you get in every similar news report. And it was all dispersed by 2 police officers.

There was also a picture on the Birmingham Mail website which showed the two men and the dogs they were walking, finishing the charity run. No egg marks on the men or the dogs.

The labour party was traditionally focused on giving democratic control of the means of production to the workers. Just like, you know, all socialists are. They made great strides in doing just that post war with nationalised industry and services, and legislature intended to protect workers' rights. Unfortunately they placed to much power in the hands of institutions (the unions) that weren't actually very democratic, and that went against their other traditional standpoint (democracy).

If Labour have turned their backs on their traditional supporters then it is because they have stopped openly pushing for socialism (I.e. the New Labour project). And five years ago, I'd be agreeing that they very much had done that.

But despite Milliband's dreadful public image (which I do hope something can be done about in time, debates would certainly help), there has been an upsurge in socialist and democratic policies in the party as of late. The national executive board of the party (who determine policy) has very recently become dominated by a majority of classically left-wing members, and there are things banging around in the draft manifestos to suggest that. It's not going to change overnight, but the labour party today is in better shape to give a genuine alternative to the conservatives than it has been for thirty years.

The only thing is, old labour don't necessarily stand for the same things that people imagine they do.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"There are two possible causes here:

1. If you're using wifi, you likely live in a wifi congested area.
1. If your area is oversubscribed you're fighting for bandwidth with your neighbours.

In order to work out which one is the problem, next time you have the issue plug your computer into your router with a network cable and turn off your wifi. Then do a speed test. If the speed test is normal when you're plugged in, then it's your wifi.

I've outlined the two points below in their own sections:

**Wifi Issues**
Wifi, because of the fact that it's a broadcasted radio signal, is heavily subject to interference. This can be from a number of sources, including (but not limited to) microwaves, cordless phones, walls, floors, ceilings, and other wifi signals in your immediate area (next door houses mainly, maybe 2 houses down in either direction if they're close together like a terrace).

The important things to note here are:

* Don't put your router or receiving device (phone, laptop etc) near a microwave or a cordless phone.
* If your house has solid (brick, stone as opposed to plasterboard) or metal-lined walls, you're SOL without a wifi range extender or signal booster when you're a room or two away from the router.
* Most wifi signals use the 2.4GHz radio band to operate, but this is subdivided into a number of smaller-width frequencies (have a look at the diagram here for more info) - there are nominally 14 of these channels, but because of local laws not all of them are accessible everywhere, and because of how close together these signals are, there are only really 4 usable channels - 1, 6, 11, and 14 (if your router has 14).

Essentially channels 2 and 3 overlap with channel 1 (and would interfere with any signal on it), channels 4 and 5 overlap with channel 6, etc etc.

And of course, because there are only this limited number of channels to choose from, wifi signals from other routers in your area will interfere with your own if they are on the same or an overlapping channel, and the odds are that there is at least one which is on each channel.

There are three options here open to you (that I can see):

* Put up with it (sorry)
* Run Ethernet cables around your house and plug in your laptop/games consoles etc - Ethernet doesn't suffer from the same interference.
* Buy a new router/wireless access point that uses the 5GHz wifi band - this is becoming more heavily used, but right now it's less congested than the 2.4GHz band is - it's also got a shorter range so fewer signals from your neighbours will interfere with it. The wifi type you are looking for here is ""Wireless AC"" or ""Wireless N 5GHz"" (note that Wireless N comes in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, make sure you get the right one)



**Broadband Issues**

Unfortunately with broadband if you live in an oversubscribed area then you are competing with everyone else in your local area for bandwidth. The broadband companies are gambling that not everyone will be using all of their broadband all of the time, so they allow more people onto the local area equipment than it could support if they all used all of their bandwidth at once.

Sadly if they get this gamble wrong (and most do in some areas) then there isn't much they can do - their options are either kick off customers (which they can't do as they have a contract and it would lose them money and reputation) or they can upgrade the equipment in the area, which costs loads in equipment, means disruption for local residents, and means downtime and planning and projects and more money to spend on all of the ""backroom"" stuff.

So most of the time the broadband companies just say ""we'll live with it"" and you have to too, because you don't have a choice.

Switching suppliers likely won't help, because they all hire the cables from OpenReach, which is part of The BT Group (BT Broadband is a separate part of the BT group and they hire the cables in the same way at the same price as everyone else thanks to the government).

The exception to this is Virgin Media cable (sadly not Virgin Media's National product, which is ADSL) - Virgin Media (back when they were NTL) laid their own TV cables, which they now use for TV and internet services (not sure about the phone bit). If Virgin are not oversubscribed you're likely to get a better service, and thanks to the upgrades they've been doing recently there is much less oversubscription than there is on ADSL.

Combined with UKIP's poor polling in Scotland, both current and last election where they kept only one deposit, and the rise of the SNP means the broadcasters would be breaching their obligation to impartiality in Scotland if UKIP were to be included in a UK wide debate without the same opportunity afforded to the SNP. 

The problem is that the UK debates and the English debates are the same thing. The flaw in your argument is that Scotland, NI, Wales and England do not have the same population, the fact that UKIP is a major party in England, would almost invariably make them a major party in the UK generally, just not in Scotland. The same is not the case in the SNP.

It's interesting that you comment on the insignificance of UKIP in Scotland as part of your argument, but the SNP are almost exactly the same for the rest of the UK.

The SNP tolls around 3-4% in the UK as a whole, and UKIP polls 3-4% in Scotland. So, if you were being consistent, if the SNP is to be included in the UK debates, then UKIP must be included in the Scottish debates!

Our government is the lowest risk institution, better to pay tax and borrow at the cheapest rate, and use the economies of scale the government has to invest in the country (infrastructure, health, education etc) thereby increasing future productivity and the tax base of the future. We seem to forget that the evidence that we should be worried about government debt was falsified, there is no fiscal cliff, debt will not explode at 70% of GDP, nor at a 100% or 250%. Don't be scared of government debt (as long as all future tax revenue remains positive we can borrow a lot before it becomes close to a problem). Think of it like a business - you either invest or don't start a business. You invest in today and reap the rewards in the future. Instead we're stripping the assets the government has and selling them. This could make sense during a boom time, for efficiency, but during a recession it's like selling your back up generator during a power cut.

It's some times hard to get emotional over government budgets but we have to realise that the money spent on welfare and infrastructure changes people's lives everyday. The rate of return for healthy,, educated, insured individual is so high that for decades the question whether to look after the population was a no brainier. Unfortunately for us, the people in charge got there without ""any"" help from the state and do not percieve the individual and collective benefits government spending supports. They only see taxes taking away their profits. The Tories are experimenting with modern Britain, to see how far they can push it to make their friends profit, to see how similar they can make our elections to american elections, to see how much donor funding they can secure, to force us to rely on informal insurances between family and friends, to make communication transparent so they can utilise our data and analyse our lives.

IMO, they're much better than the major parties on a lot of issues, but no, they're not perfect. So why does half of r/uk want to throw them on the scrapheap because they're not perfect? 

&gt; So why support them at all? Isn't this what everyone complains about.. failed promises anyone?

I see your point, but I was more meaning if they ever became properly electable (though I guess that's a bit chicken and egg).  
If somehow they were elected a majority at the next election, and they broke promises, that's one thing, I was more meaning, if in 2020/2025 they have a serious chance of any power, I doubt those would still be on their manifesto (or if they were, they'd be the first thing to compromise in any coalition agreement).  

Which means that supporting them now isnt a bad idea, if they're in a position to get power and those policies are still there, maybe look elsewhere.

null,false,Olog,null,null,null,"Sure that kind of works, but it's very easy to defend yourself against that. First, if you see the certificate suddenly change, you might become suspicious that something might be going on. If you really want to be careful about your security, at this point you'd stop whatever you're doing and make sure on another channel that the certificate change is genuine. I'm pretty sure there are already addons for browsers that do this.

But more than that, there's nothing that forces you to use the default certificate authorities. Any terrorist group could easily just sign their own certificates and add them in their browser or their custom made instant messenger. The government isn't going to get in the middle of that. If you can establish the trust of a certificate in some other way, like say exchanging them in person, you don't need a third party involved. Or your trusted third party can be within your terrorist organisation and you just set that as your only trusted certificate authority. 

So no, it really isn't trivial to monitor all SSL communications, it's practically impossible. At most they can monitor the communication of people who don't really care much about their security and just go with the default settings, i.e. the people that the law explicitly isn't targeting.

Conventional economics is, I believe, a tool which is fundamentally unsuited to solving this issue, even if they finally bother to take externalities into account (the fact that they ignored externalities from the outset being frankly a ludicrous oversight).  Again, things like overfishing and deforestation are a result of market failures, and the completely inappropriate attempt to put monetary value on things like ecosystem services, when such a measure is probably more harmful than anything.

And finally, there's plent of evidence of nonlinear responses in the fossil record (mass extinctions, meltwater pulses, etc).  Tipping points are a common feature of almost all complex systems.
