Yes we paid overtop for them, but rating a player's performance by their wages is a pointless thing to do.

Are we sure we want a back-up to Hoolahan and not someone for Hoolahan to be back up for? We have plenty of cash, and I'm pretty sure we could do better, especially since he might not have it in him to be consistent for a whole season anymore.

Definitely competition for Whittaker, and maybe back-up for Olssen, who I think can definitely be Premiership quality - but then Garrido is an alright player for back-up with Premiership experience. Would have been awesome if Alderwield had waited and not gone to Southampton. Another centre back or two wouldn't go amiss.

TBH, I wouldn't want to touch the Tetty - Johnson - Howson - Redmond midfield - I think that's already premiership quality, but I'd want a midfielder or two for options that are better than our current squad players (not including Dorrens, who is good enough I think). A decent left-winger, maybe back-up for Redmond too.

In short, I think we don't need to do more than 2-3 defenders, 1-2 midfielders, and 1 attacker. I'd rather we spent 5-6 million on four players each of real quality.

It wasn't until later that I discovered that Tourette's gang had actually pulled out that day, and been replaced by a completely different and completely innocent band.

You might even remember this media [blip.] (http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/balls--jose-mourinho-reveals-what-is-lacking-in-chelsea-title-challenge-9224463.html) Although the acquisitions of Costa and Fabregas were the foundations of our strong title challenge, Drogba was invaluable in reinforcing the winning mentality. 

With Lampard and Cole leaving, the dressing room needed a vocal figure alongside Terry and Cech and no one other than Drogba could have filled that void better. You probably don't watch many Chelsea games or even follow Chelsea, otherwise you would know how much reverence Drogba gets from the players.

Pre and Post game you can see him cheering and pushing the team forward. You can see how much the current Chelsea team wants to emulate legacy before them. To see and play with the living legend himself, the team has developed an unquestionable fortitude.

I have watched both play many times this season. Di Maria is tied with Chris Brunt for assists this season. Chris Brunt plays with players magnitudes worse than the players Di Maria plays with. Di Maria has done awful. As for Falcao, he scored 4 goals this entire season. If you actually thought he was good, you would be picking up his option.

If Yaya stays, the first thing we need to do is get a future replacement lined up and in the team. Yaya can't play every game at a high level, that's obvious, so we need to get another, younger player who can do his job and then replace him in a year or two. 

IMO the obvious candidate is Kondogbia. We know Monsco will sell if they get a good price, we know he's got quality and on top of having a tidy long shot and great passing range, he's really solid defensively. 

Get him in this summer, play a rotation of him and Yaya when we are playing 442 and playing all three of them when we play 4231 (like we have been Yaya, Fernandinho and Lampard recently). 

He's literally the perfect option. And I have 0 confidence Begiristain will do anything like it. 

If we go into next season with only Fernando, Fernandinho and Yaya as our central midfielders, Begiristain should be fired.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt;Buy-to-let is a total cancer and it now seems pretty much everyone's at it. Everywhere I go, I see signs in estate agent windows advertising properties as ""ideal investment opportunity"", other signs saying ""Should you invest your pension in a buy to let?"" or ""We can help you become a landlord - ask us today!"" etc.

The thing people don't get about BTL is why it's profitable. To put it simply: If there were too many people buying property to rent, the rental price would drop and the whole enterprise would be unprofitable. The whole reason BTL works right now, is because there is a lot of demand for rental property too! Get rid of BTL landlords, and the price to buy will probably fall by 10-20%, but the price to rent will rise by much more than this. Which is great for the middle class kids leaving uni looking to buy their first home, not so good for the poor who realistically will never be able to own their own home, regardless of a 20% drop.

The problem is simple: Not enough housing is built. Demonising BTL landlords isn't going to solve anything.

&gt;Then you have the government extending Right To Buy (taking solid council properties out of circulation for a mere pittance)

The original RTB wasn't a bad scheme. So back in the 50's the govt built giant estates consisting of solely social housing. This caused the areas in question to suffer from high crime rates and general unpleasantness, which is turn affected the kids who were raised there, causing a vicious cycle. By flogging at least a significant portion off, most of those areas are now quite pleasant. The big problem is that they didn't replenish the stock, so now there's a severe shortage of social housing available.

&gt;Help To Buy (forcing people onto the property ladder who can't afford it).

**Tony Barrett**

**Published 1 minute ago**

Liverpool are preparing a bid for Christian Benteke but will not lodge it until after Aston Villa have played Arsenal in the FA Cup final on Saturday.

Benteke enters the final two years of his contract at Villa Park this summer and Liverpool are hopeful that an offer of more than £20 million will convince Villa to sell the Belgium forward, who Brendan Rodgers wants to become the new spearhead of his attack.

Rodgers wants to add greater physicality and firepower to Liverpool’s front line and believes that Benteke would provide both qualities, hence the 24-year-old emerging as one of the club’s chief transfer targets before what promises to be another close season of change at Anfield.

Liverpool have also begun the process of overhauling their squad by preparing the way for those players Rodgers has deemed surplus to requirements to leave.

In a significant indication of Rodgers’s influence regardless of speculation about his future, José Enrique, the left back, and Fabio Borini, the forward, have both been told to find themselves new clubs in recent days.

Neither player features in Rodgers’s plans and Liverpool will look to sell the out-of-favour duo, with Borini ready to accept that his time at Anfield is over after rejecting a £14 million transfer to Sunderland last summer to stay and fight for his place.

That decision has backfired. Borini started only three Barclays Premier League games all season despite Daniel Sturridge’s injury problems and Rodgers’s reluctance to use either Rickie Lambert or Mario Balotelli. Similarly, Enrique, who has also had injury problems, has started only twice in the league.

Lambert will be allowed to leave to play regular first-team football, while Balotelli will also be sold if a buyer can be found, having long been written off as a poor acquisition. Brad Jones and Glen Johnson are already in the process of securing moves, with their contracts set to expire in the coming weeks.

The biggest casualty of the cull could be Lazar Markovic, who has struggled to make an impact since joining Liverpool from Benfica in a £20 million deal last summer. Although Liverpool retain confidence in the winger’s talent, there is a concern that he may not be equipped to thrive in English football.

Liverpool continue to work on incoming transfers and deals for Danny Ings and James Milner are understood to be close.

Kolo Touré and Andre Wisdom have both signed contract extensions. Touré has agreed an additional year, with his present deal set to expire next month, while Wisdom, who has spent
the season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, has committed his future to Liverpool until 2019.

Rodgers remains at the heart of Liverpool’s planning and there is nothing to suggest that the manager’s position is under threat.
Rather than abandoning their managerial structure, in which Rodgers works as part of a transfer committee, the immediate post-season indications are that Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), is planning a series of refinements and  improvements to the model.

There is no intention to appoint a director of football, but the club’s backroom staff is likely to be bolstered in keeping with FSG’s belief that Rodgers would benefit from greater support.",null,0,null,1432676989,null,0,false,0,crlstpv,null,t3_37dno6,null,t1_crlstpv,null,t3_37dno6,null,null,null,1433282514,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

**Something to think about:** For Liverpool's 18 title winning seasons, the Liverpool top scorer netted 22 goals on average. And his partner scored 15 goals, giving an average partnership total of 37 goals.

**Solution:** Buy a quality, proven striker who will score *at least* 22 goals. And give him a partner(s) who will score *at least* 15 goals.

* I really wouldn't mind Benteke if we get him for a good price as I rate him quite highly. I don't want us to overpay by a large amount if we do get him. Another slight concern (as I have only seen games of his here and there and not a consistent run of games) is whether he's a guaranteed fit as opposed to a striker more similar in style to Suarez as that was what worked previously for us. I'm also not sure how much Benteke presses, but I guess he can always learn to do that.
* I'm fine with Milner, Ings &amp; Benteke but they shouldn't be our only signings. We still need a creative/scoring central midfielder, a proper defensive midfielder as we only have Lucas, an RCB (unless Lovren/Ilori/Wisdom settle there), a backup goalkeeper and maybe 1 more striker.
* I expected Borini and Enrique to be sold with the lack of playing time they've had this season. I feel a little sorry for Borini though, I think he should've been given more chances and could've done well this season. A move will be best for his career now though, so all the best to Fabio and Jose.
* I also expected Lambert to be sold as he may be able to play more often at a lower team such as Bournemouth, for example.
* I still think Balotelli has a lot to offer us if used in the way he should be (with a partner up top)
* I think the worries about Markovic not being ""equipped"" for England are a load of shit.

However, its imperative that, whenever fit, we need to play Studge and him together. I think we have forgotten how, even the likes of me who play limited amount of sunday footy know, hard its to defend against two strikers. Especially because you have to have a midfielder (DM) track one of them at all times. Solitary striker, I believe, only works well in the following two scenarios. One, is when you have a brilliant mid-field that can waltz through the back line and make the difficult passes. ex Chelsea (Hazzard, Oscar, Willian et. al), Arsenal. Second is you have a world beater of a striker in the mould of Drogba, Torres (In his prime, we still had World class Steven Gerrard with him), Benzema even. Otherwise I think its very hard to break down teams that sit back with the kind of build-up football we like to play.
As far as injuries are concerned, and I know Studge is made out of glass, which truly fantastic striker is injury free? Aguero? Costa? ( I am talking about EPL--much more physical). I am not saying Benteke is fantastic or anything.

 Sometimes some players simply perform better statistically in smaller teams where they're biggest stars, and once they move on to better team they decline A LOT, but sometimes it's the opposite, and they perform better with better team (which always sounds more logical, but it doesn't always play out in reality), so if we buy him, I hope it will be the latter.

Bear in mind, if you enter the amount incorrectly, your account will lock, and you will need to contact their support to restart the process of verifying the card. 

Once the card is verified, and you're depositing, the amount in GBP is credited to your account on coincorner, and then you use that to buy BTC.

The closest example we have of a country of a similar size functioning as a democracy is the U.S and even that has so many flaws in its system, such as a dysfunctional congress, institutional racism and billions of dollars spent on election donations. 

The idea that the European Union, with an even bigger population and wider range of language and culture, could somehow form a nation without any of these problems occurring seems absurd, especially as there don't seem to be any measures in place to prevent them at the moment.

The point I'm trying to make about accountability is that in the UK I am one of 60 million members of the electorate, if I wanted to complain about an international company trying to force a change of law, I know I'm in a constituency of 100,000 and can try raise awareness of the issue and influence my MP.
 Whereas in terms of the EU, the international company will still be the same size and still have the same amount of money, but I will instead be one of 500 million in a constituency of 8,520,000 in which there are 10 representatives and so I have a lot less influence on the EU and it is harder for me to hold them to account on any decisions.

Displeasure at poor cycling is not entirely unfounded either. Earlier in the year I was hit by a cyclist on the pavement (on top of the numerous close misses that I've mentioned in the past) - came away with a bruised arm and the cyclist didn't stop. Only last week I had *another* near miss as a cyclist on the pavement rounded a blind corner and nearly hit me. 

I wish I were making these cases up and compared to people who *are* being hit by cars there's not much comparison of severity. 

But I still don't believe we should ignore the issue of bad cycling completely. In this case it *is* clear cut and whilst that shouldn't be enough to make demons of anyone on two wheels - it should be enough to bring a little pressure in the right places and look at improving infrastructure / getting cyclists off pavements where pedestrians are at risk.

Benteke is great and would do well at a lot of clubs but not Liverpool. Suarez was successful because he's world class and the nutmeg king.

Benteke isn't either of these Liverpool doesn't play like this thats why they put Sterling up front. IMO Ings would probably do better than Benteke but I'm not convinced that either of them are the answer. LFC has the tools and the system to work with a pacey poacher any players that don't fit that description should be brought in as surplus.

http://www.kumb.com/article.php?id=2991 (about Tomkins signing with him, but also delves into the history)

edit: too lazy to click the link?  some relevant quotes:

&gt; On Saturday afternoon [Jan 21], prior to West Ham United's 2-1 nPower Championship win over Nottingham Forest that took Sam Allardyce's side to the top of the table for the first time this season, it was confirmed that James Tomkins had signed a lucrative four-year contract with an option for a further year.

&gt; ...

&gt; However KUMB.com has learned that prior to the start of the January transfer window and the award of his new contract, Tomkins dropped Giess and Skillequal in favour of alternative representation - an agent called Mark Curtis.

~~

&gt; Curtis was, ""more or less chairman"" at Bolton during Sam Allardyce's reign as manager: the inference being that Curtis had control of the club's transfer policy.

~~

&gt; According to mannyroad.com, a website run by Bolton Wanderers supporters who have extensively investigated the agent's dealings in the past, ""Curtis and controversy are never far apart. Suffice to say that he has the uncanny knack of being on hand when a player on the move dumps his agent, leaving him or one of his associates to act on behalf of the buying club, thus obtaining a hefty commission.""

Anyway. I agree with everything you said. But that's not the point I was making. Let's assume that 50% of those hit and runs are done by cyclists, I'd still be questioning the coverage this particular incident has been getting.

Because its so disproportionate not only do I think it's bad for cyclists, actually it's bad for everyone. There's an elephant in the room no ones talking about, and why is no one talking about it?

People have said the media coverage is just what the cyclists deserves. And again that's fine, but where is the media coverage of the others? Cyclists and motorists?

there will be a logical tipping point for that argument. And that will be when cycling becomes close to or as dangerous as driving.

Until that point there will always be more arguments for encouraging cycling than making it difficult/costly (training).


Training in school is fine too, but the issue there is motorists. Unfortunaly many of them are in charge of cars, and many of them ignore, or are ignorant to what cyclists can and cannot do.

Example - teach little Timmy to take a central line to change lanes. How successful is that going to be when many motorists assume all cyclists should be out of the way of cars? It's only going to take one idiot and Timmys fucked.m

OP, I definitely recommend getting a full survey AND a wiring check in those circumstances, as the electrical regs have changed quite a lot in the last few years, and we have way more gadgets these days, so it's worth finding out if it can cope with getting extra sockets added. If it is going to need a full re-wire and/or a new bathroom, if your budget can stretch to getting that done before you move in then it will make life much much easier, rather than having to deal with the disruption once you're in place. The important thing is to make sure you both accept that it's not going to be your dream home from day one, and to work out a plan of action that you can both live with aesthetically, financially and organisationally. If you only have the time and money to do up one room a year, is it more important that you make the living room the kind of place you can entertain, or your bedroom a haven from the ongoing project, or getting the kitchen as a workable space to cook and eat?

If you're not 18 or don't pay for the WiFi then big deal, you technically shouldn't be watching it anyway, and before the Internet you couldn't buy porn anyway.

The service isn't the best. When it's busy, it can take you AGES to get served, as they often seem understaffed, and I've not found the staff to be that bothered about serving people or being helpful either.

I'd advise against getting food there if it's busy. They have an arbitrary system for serving food, where food ordered from one bar will only be brought to one group of tables, and the other bar will only serve food to another group of tables. Sometimes they stop serving food at one bar early, but the other bar can't take orders from you if you're sat the extra couple of metres down the room. If it's busy and you can't move tables, no food for you - and it might take 15 mins of queuing to find out! I've been caught out by this and I'm still a little bit bitter about it.

If you/your parents know the owners of local businesses, you could always ask them. They'd be more likely to hire you over others, as they know you (I did this). Local businesses are more likely to need people over the summer as people go on holiday, etc. and they need people to cover the shifts.

Otherwise, just apply everywhere - my gf spent 2 weeks straight applying everywhere and sending her cv to everywhere, and most places didn't even bother responding. The only place to give her an interview was (as mentioned by another reply in this thread) a call centre.

-------------------------------------------------

**For a regular job:**

At 17 - go for an apprenticeship. Lots available, and as long as you get one in a decent industry (Engineering, etc.) you'll be set for life. I have a few friends doing this, and their job is pretty much set already, minus the student debt of university.

&gt; 
&gt; The road was closed and crowds of neighbours watched as Georgia, believed to currently weigh between 55 and 60 stone, was finally brought out covered in a blanket

How humiliating, and this is the second time this has happened. I do not agree with fat shaming and bullying people, but surely this girl needs some sort of mental health intervention? I would suspect [Prada Willi Syndrome?](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prader-willi-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx). It's one thing to just be a fat person in denial and enjoy food a bit too much, and quite another to eat yourself to death. Looking at what this article says, she gained 23 stone in 2 years. 

I am not a nutritionist, but I imagine it would take some extreme eating to excess to gain 1 stone every month? (maybe someone could break that down for me..? calories per day for a sedentary person needed and the excess that would cause a stone a month gain etc)

A colleague of mine suffers from Anorexia. A few years ago she apparently lost weight so drastically that she weighed just under 6 stone (she's 5""3) and told me that she was almost detained under section when her consultant become concerned for her life (**I don't know if this is true; its purely anecdotal and I'm relying on her truthfulness**) But, if this is truly how eating disorders are managed by MH services, then surely an 19 year old weighing 63 stone must also be considered to be in danger due to eating habits? 

I don't know wtf I'm trying to say here.. I'm trying to think that maybe she isn't just a gluttonous pig, but likely to be suffering a mental illness?

Unfortunately, he also plays for a club that could easily be back challenging for titles next season, and if he were to leave he would be fielding a lot of attractive offers from top teams. I really only see us having a shot at him if Klopp comes at some point. 

As for the rest of them...ehhhhh, there's probably a future superstar or two on that list, but we really, *really* need to be looking to sign a seasoned (25-28yo) goalscorer who's been proven over at least a couple years in a top league. I wasn't always a big fan of that argument, but after this past season I just don't think there's any way around it. We've loaded up on a lot of youth talent in the last couple years, we've got Origi coming in, and I'm sure we'll buy one or two more young kids this summer...but we really just cannot hope to buy a 20yo striker and expect them to show up and plug into our first team and suddenly solve our scoring problem...that shit just doesn't happen. Son stands out as another guy who *may* be able to do it for us, but the wildcard there is his nationality...Koreans take a long time to settle into new teams and cultures, and in general they just don't have a great track record in Europe. It'd probably take him at least a year or two to get on track with us if he came in, and we just can't wait that long. 

FWIW, I do agree with you that Mitrovic could be absolutely superb at some point, but I don't think it happens for a couple more years. I hope he stays at Anderlecht for another season or two, or goes to a club like Ajax or PSV...if he does, then he could be set to absolutely destroy Europe for some big club by the time he's 22/23.

Anyone that watched football regularly the past two seasons knows Dave is one of the very best left backs in the world. There was a fan on this sub who was arguing with me the other day that Marcelo is definitely better than Dave. Marcelo is like a wing-back, he rarely contributes anything worth mentioning in defense. He spends more time in the attacking third that leads to his team being caught up on breaks. The past 4 seasons, he only had one great season. The other left back praised so much is Alaba. He is also good going forward, but still Dave is much better than him when it comes to defending. A defender should never be praised more for his attacking talent. His primary job is defending, the very first praise they should get is for how they defend not how they attack. If they are miserable at defending and good attacking they would still be praised by some people. Especially, if they play for a big team that wins major trophies every season. The popularity thing is real. Someone like Dani Alves was nominated by FIFA few times and how many people think he has ever been the best fullback in the world at any given time? Good defenders are rarely nominated, especially if they don't play for tops clubs or don't score goals or even not flashy enough. Last season, no one mentioned Boateng and Godin. Even though, they had a better season than all the other center backs on FIFA best 11. Pique was nominated few times and he has never been considered the best center back in the world at any time. The same thing with Iniesta nomination, he had one of his worst seasons. And yet, his name was still up there. Modric was forgotten because he is not too flashy and he looks like a homeless.

""He was taken into custody in Bangor on 28 February 2013 after being on the run for 24 hours. He was arrested at the home of his friend Pastor Mark Gordon, who claimed that the arrest had been arranged with police. Gordon objected to how the arrest was portrayed in the media, stating that Bryson was in an unlocked bedroom rather than hiding in a locked attic.[12] Whilst on the run Bryson posted a video on the internet calling the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) ""fascists"" and mocking their inability to apprehend him.[13] Bryson was one of three protest leaders arrested, the others being Frazer and former British National Party funder Jim Dowson, with Dowson the only one of the three to be granted bail.[14] In early March Bryson was charged with six matters relating to the protests,[15] in response to which he briefly went on hunger strike.[16] The hunger strike was reported to have lasted only half a day, and Bryson's request for an Indian takeaway led fellow loyalist inmates to label him as ""Jamie Biryani"".[12] On 11 March he was moved from the main complex for remand prisoners in Maghaberry Prison to the separate building containing segregated loyalist wings, Bush House. He had asked to be transferred for his own safety due to threats he had allegedly received from dissident republican inmates,[17] although the prison acknowledged that dissident republican prisoners were held outside the main complex in a third part of the prison, Roe House.""

Even the ill-fated outlay after Bale's departure left us with change in our pockets... which is not exactly a sign of ambition, when we were not just looking to maintain the status quo of Bale's amazing season, but actually improve upon it.  You can see how easily the same thing happened to Liverpool after Suarez left.  You can only replace world class players with world class players... not only ""potential"".

Either Levy needs to back off on the Champions League talk and happily accept Europa with making a profit from players each year, or put his money where his mouth is and actually lay down some markers in the transfer market.

One poor summer shouldn't be enough to deter us if 4th place is really our ambition.  Even with Man City's oil money, it took them a few seasons of signing a whole lot of Javi Garcias and Robinhos before they actually struck upon the right formula.  Success can't just happen in one transfer window.

Henderson (Skrtel needs a shout) has been our best player this year.

Our best performance this season was Spurs(3-0).

The club's most underrated player is Luis Alberto (or Sakho like someone else said).

Next season Alberto Moreno will have a breakthrough season.

With Rodgers at the helm, Liverpool's future is stalled.

In order to achieve a top 4 place in the years to come, the club must have confidence and knowledge mixed with funding and quality.

If Rodgers is sacked, Rafa Benitez/Arsene Wenger should take his place.

In five years Liverpool will be 6th.

The four players that could improve the squad dramatically are: Aurier, Gonalons, Eriksen, Jovetic.

If i could say one thing to Sterling, it would be thanks for all you've offered Liverpool, I hope you do your best as long as you're in a Liverpool shirt.

I can't understand how we think it's a good idea to cut something most of the world is fairly envious of as a decent national news service, that does it's job extremely well and has world class programming it can export and also turn a profit in other areas. You don't have to like it, you don't have to hate it, but you do have to understand why it's pretty bloody important and necessary.

Maybe it's the same people who want to cut the BBC as those who are fine with NHS privatisation; which might as well be completely named Virgin Health or something in some areas. Although the BBC also uses only a few production companies too by way of moderation in this fairly tenuous link or compariosn.

At this point the entire club, from Levy to Poch and his assistants, seems to be heading in that direction, that we'll be bleeding in more academy products and diamonds in the rough as opposed to spending big on finished products as we did with the magnificent seven. The thinking is probably that the last time we did anything like that, we made it to the CL, so I can see the rationale. 

We'll see over the summer if there really is a transfer strategy or if it's more of the same scattershot approach that's been plaguing us since the start of AVB's tenure. But for now, Poch has given Fazio and Stambouli limited time even though Fazio has shown a good capacity for defensive organization and Mason had a downturn in form (I still believe that he can be a starter with us though). 

I'm cautiously optimistic about the summer, really. Maybe it's that last summer was Poch's first and he didn't get enough time to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the squad (and seeing if we can fix any of those through the academy), but the most we can hope to see is a coherent plan that addresses flaws in the team. 

As far as who the statement buy should be, I love the idea of having Lavezzi around, even if it is to teach Lamela a few things.

I agree Levy wants his cake and to eat it too regarding Champions League.

Even Wenger, for all his penny-pinching, has realised that they can't even hold onto top four without some big spending.  Where would they be this season without Sanchez?

I just think Levy's been at best disingenuous, and at worst completely foolish, to insist that not securing 4th place is a fireable offense.  Obviously Poch's been granted some leniency this term, but how much more bad football and losses to Stoke will he be allowed to endure next term before Levy's trigger finger starts itching again?

I'd be perfectly happy to reset the short-term goals to top six every year, making some money on transfers and building the new stadium.  I think they're perfectly reasonable short-term goals.

You can't allow the prosecuter to be prosecuted in an ongoing trial like that; as that gives them no opportunity to prepare a defence. 


What your suggesting here would effectively mean that, when someone reports a rape and it goes to trial, the roles of defender and prosecuter would be switched and the alleged victim would have to prove they aren't a liar rather than prove their alleged attacker raped them.

This is a way for the larger companies in the industry to drive out the competition. I imagine primarily the free sites, whose profits from advertising are smaller so are less able to meet new regulation like this.

A popular place to begin is with the Eighth Doctor. There are two main starting points for these: The stories in Big Finish's Main Range, or the Eighth Doctor Adventures. Basically, the Main Range tales are set earlier, are far more like Classic Who in style and are cheaper. They are set earlier for him, but there is little crossover between the two ranges, so you can easily start with either.

There are also the Dark Eyes tales, but these follow on directly to the Eighth Doctor Adventures, and although you *can* start with them, it really isn't the best place.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2xy90b/8th_doctor_audios_starting_points/) is a discussion of the order to listen to the Eighth Doctor stories. Really, you can start off by working you way through either the Main Range stories or the Eighth Doctor Adventure stories and go back and fill in the other odds and ends later if you want to. You won't miss anything vital. The one exception to that is that **An Earthly Child** which you really should listen to before *Relative Dimensions*.

You can buy them as CDs or downloads from [here](http://www.bigfinish.com/). Their site is immensely confusing to navigate - due to the overwhelming number of ranges that they produce, so expect to spend a little time working you way through it. However, here is [Storm Warning](http://www.bigfinish.com/search_results?txtSearch=storm+warning&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) - the first Eight in the Main Range, and here is the start of the [Eighth Doctor Adventures](http://www.bigfinish.com/search_results?txtSearch=eighth+doctor+adventures&amp;x=0&amp;y=0).

I don't really buy the argument that BR is some sort of tactical genius for what happened last season. People are acting as if he invented the diamond midfield formation. The sad fact is we had two of the most in form strikers in the world last season and we scored an insane amount of goals and that is what carried us to 2nd place. BR has always preferred a one striker system, but when you have two strikers who can't stop scoring you have to work around that. That doesn't suddenly make you a great manager. A great manager does not get tactically outplayed by Crystal Palace, Stoke, Aston Villa, West Ham, and Hull in a single season. 

We set up to score goals last year and our defensive stability suffered due to it. It was pretty clear we were just looking to outscore our opponents and the only that mattered was 3 points and that's fine if you have the front line to do so. I just think BR is struggling to find a balance between the two now that we have no strikers to compensate for the loss of Suarez / Sturridge which is very worrying. It's very rare to score 100 goals in a season, and it's not something that you can rely on consistently. This is why most top teams start with solidifying the back 4. 

When we went to 3 at the back we had a very good run defensively but were even less of a threat up front and got quite lucky with a few of our wins. BR seems to be very stubborn, when it comes to the transfer committee, man management, or even dealing with the press. Only after all the comments about our poor defence and his response of how easy it was to defend we made this swap to three at the back. There is 0 chance of us getting back to Suarez / Sturridge levels of goalscoring, and the back three wont work long term. Since we swapped out of the back three we started conceding more goals, and everyone looks just as lost as they were at the beginning of the season. If you re-watch the matches from the beginning of the season, and then watch the last few matches of the season, it's actually maddening how similar it is. Almost nothing has improved. 

I don't think our squad is better than any of the top 4, so it doesn't annoy me that we didn't get top 4. What annoys me is how dismal our football has been given the squad we have. It's even more frustrating given the fact United and Spurs were extremely average as well and we still finished behind them. It's not a bad squad at all, it's actually the best squad we've had in the past 5-6 years overall even with our extremely poor decision making in the transfer market and the fact we overpay for everyone. From what has been written in the papers, BRs signings have been some of the worst in that regard too. We already struggle to bring in top players due to the fact we are not able to compete with the top 4 in terms of wages, champions league football, and a manager who's not known outside of the UK. A well connected, well known, manager like Klopp definitely has a draw that BR does not have. Regardless of that, the fact that we have gone a whole season without any signs of improvement is what worries me the most. It seems like BR has no idea what direction he wants to go. If our manager is at this point, then what's the difference in bringing in another manager who will be starting from scratch as well?

Maybe a cyclist rode like a cunt, maybe it was a shared path and it was an accident, either way a stranger is dead and we should all feel sympathy for his loved ones. 

If it was a foot not shared path, then someone should say the cyclist shouldn't have been on it, a cyclist should say, it because the roads are lethal, someone else suggests if you must cycle on the pavement then cycle at no more than 5 mph to protect pedestrians just like we expect cars to drive at 20 in urban roads.

I said no, and they then asked me to go ahead and tick a box. After doing what the policeman said I then saw the small print next to the box ""Tick here if you allow your fingerprints to be stored"".

12 years later, I get a knock on the door from the police to arrest me on theft charges. Cutting a long story short, it turned out after opening someones door on their car to put carpet samples in for them to take home (I sell carpet for a living), the person I was serving had bought a stolen car. Cops check the car for prints, and low and behold they find my prints on the door handle. I could've saved myself several weeks of mental torture and lost earnings had I just not ticked that box.

If that's not an option, the mortgage interest is deductible (as mentioned in the other comments), so it can make sense to have an interest only mortgage. Also, (slight side note) we only put down the minimum (25%) deposit, i.e. invest the bank's money, not your own.

* Medium spec - £800/m^2

1. Sum up how much you want to be able to spend in any given year.
1. Multiply this amount by about 33.

Calculations are easier if you have already paid off your mortgage but can still be done otherwise. As another poster noted it isn't always optimum to pay off a mortgage given current interest rates. That said if being debt free is important then paying off your mortgage is still an option.

In the mean time make maximum use possible out of pensions, (S&amp;S) NISAs allowances &amp; later on if required CGT allowance. Once you hit the magic number worked out earlier just draw down your investments at 3.0% per annum indefinitely. At this rate the capital element of your portfolio should last indefinitely.

Charities can intervene and offer help to people at the right point before something more drastic and expensive is required. Someone going through this ordeal and not having counselling on offer when they need it could end up unable to work and with more serious mental health problems.

But that's the thing, in many areas, BTL is unprofitable on a monthly-cashflow basis, unless the landlord pays mostly cash with either a small or non-existant mortgage; but in this case any rental price would be profitable as long as it was above the bare-minimum maintenance the landlord reluctantly performs.

Generally speaking you are right, however, the growth of the BTL sector has put a ceiling on rent prices; which is why rental prices rises have been much, much lower than purchase prices.  Something needs to be done to level off this imbalance though, as any shocks to the system would be amplified by such a gap.  If something happened to cause a lot of landlords to leave en-masse, then there would be a single massive spike in rental prices, at least for a while.",null,0,null,1432714426,null,0,false,0,crmap1q,null,t3_37c9sz,null,t1_crmap1q,null,t1_crls37p,null,null,null,1433291016,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Result is that we have a large number of part time workers and we get the most flexibility out of them if we have them working from home. 

To support that we use software based phones that connect into our in office phone system via a VPN. Why use a VPN? Firstly it allows us to control exactly who has any hope of reaching the phone system which is useful for obvious reasons and it encrypts the data in transit so there should be no way for anyone to ""tap"" a line. 

It effectively allows a computer anywhere to act like it was plugged into the network in the office without security risks. As another example I'm off sick currently but I had to sort out an issue with a transfer of files (using a VPN to make secure transfer of data to a bank as it happens) so connected my VPN and through that to the server I needed. 

As you can see banning VPNs would destroy homeworking and the government isn't stupid enough for that (and hopefully not stupid enough to actually want ""back doors"" as that undermines the whole point of them with the same result) but there might be more insidious attempts to deal with it.

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"Capitalism does apply to housing, but that's not a bad thing in itself.  It's bad when the number of transactions falls so low that the market is cornered by speculators.

But otherwise owning a flat to lent would be an asset like any other, and one that has pros and cons.  

The trouble we're in now is everyone believes property is a one-way street, and when seen over a 15-year event horizon you can see why.  Over a 100-year event horizon it also looks true, but: a) so does every other asset class; and b) it smooths out the periods of pain when it wasn't true.

Take your friend, for example.  I imagine what remains on their mortgage is tiny and not worth worrying about, so they see the rent as ""free money"".  But whether it's actually a good deal or not depends.  If that flat would fetch £500,000, that's a yield of 4.2%, not bad but only if you believe there to be no risk.

Yet taking a risk is precisely why people hang on to property.  Instead of selling-up and using the money to buy somewhere new, people take out a massive mortgage on the new place, and ""own two homes"".  It's a leveraged bet.  In terms of cash-flow it should cancel-out as the rent from Place A will subsidise the mortgage for Place B.  However that balance seems to have been passed.  People are happy to pay £1,800/month on a new mortgage for a sum of money, while simultaneously holding on a property of equal value earning only £1,400/month (minus maintenance costs/void periods/etc.)

TL;DR - if the housing market were genuinely a rational capitalist market place we wouldn't have anything to worry about, as both for-sale and to-rent markets would reach a natural equilibrium moving only according to macro-economic forces in the local and wider economy.  But instead we have a cornered market with people making irrational decisions, with speculators gambling on these trends.

For those few who actually have a choice whether or not to enter the housing market (not many, as they've been priced out ages ago), it's a difficult situation.  For those who are genuinely rich, it's a fertile land for betting; for those who can just afford to buy however, it's a nonsensical world.  You're betting that these irrational forces will continue forever, or that a unprecedented economic boost will remove the imbalances from the bottom (and does so without raising interest rates, because that would make all these calculations much worse, not least your own mortgage cost).

It's very difficult to come to any conclusion other than we're at the top of a massive asset price bubble.  This doesn't mean it's going to burst any-time soon, indeed the whole Tory economic plan is to keep it going for as long as is technically possible.  But none of the ""this is actually normal"" explanations make much sense, as they're usually based on extrapolating one-or-two metrics to show a smooth line thereby implying sustainability; but the debt levels (both in terms of amount, but more importantly as a multiple), the rent-vs-buy gulf (rental prices should be much higher if there were a genuine shortage of housing in total), and the fact that most actors in the market will only get a pay-off is all these numbers not only stay high, but get higher at an above-average rate... 

It just doesn't make any sense and no commentator explains it above dismissive comments like ""supply vs. demand"" - literally page one of every economics text-book - you need to go much further beyond that to predict the levels of supply and demand, for instance.",null,0,null,1432715631,null,0,false,0,crmazam,null,t3_37c9sz,null,t1_crmazam,null,t1_crlx2zr,null,null,null,1433291221,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's going to require a lot of cash to run the miles of fibre to each pole. The remaining few metres to the home is generally not a huge deal except in limited circumstances, like areas with directly buried cable (and is the cost you can fully recover - in the installation fee)

And you have to think about the costs of G.FAST DSLAMs (you'll need thousands) and modems and their eventual replacement when the weather has its way with them. Being a brand new technology they won't be cheap. So would running fibre actually be cheaper? Maybe. Then look at the savings by being able to dump copper entirely (lower maintenance costs) and infrastructure to support it (you don't need 5500 exchanges anymore) and it's hard to see why BT doesn't think it's a winner

Even BT sees this - that's why they're suggesting FTTH will be the ""premium"" option. So they're going to add to the workload by installing FTTH equipment on the poles anyway even if G.FAST happens.

&gt; When we can keep upping the power and make the most of the current copper

They're shortening copper length and using higher frequencies, not really upping the ""power"" as such. Anyway, all these copper bodges are delaying the inevitable. I wonder how much FTTP they could have built by the time they've done VDSL and G.FAST?

null,false,Moinmoiner,,Labour Member,null,"Hey mate, I didn't mean to insult you - I realise that the LDs are just as broad a church as our party and have some fundamentally different ways of looking at the world as us. I know it's a mistake we in the Labour party often make, assuming that the LDs (or Greens, SNP, whatever) are basically just the same as us with a different-coloured rosette and an added 'gimmick', be that a commitment to civil liberties, the environment or an independent Scotland. But I realise that's not actually the case, and that British Liberalism is a tradition in its own right. 

However that being said, talking with a lot of my LD-supporting friends and family, they agree we have *a lot* of common ground, far more for instance than with the Tories, and share the goal of shutting them out of government. I don't know if that's typical, as there probably are some LDs who feel themselves more at ease with the Tories. However that's just what I've experienced, and assuming we might want to work together, thought perhaps an electoral alliance could be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties involved, but you're quite welcome to disagree. 
 
This an aside, but I think you're being a bit unfair on the LPP; whilst I acknowledge that a commitment to PR is probably not coming anytime soon because of how well the party does out of FPTP they have shown the ability to be open to reform, for instance with the implementation of MMP in the Scottish parliament and widespread support for AV in 2011. Not perfect, I concede, but a step in the right direction and at least one more than the Tories.

If that does happen they will likely come round your house to check up on the kids. You sound like a good mum so I imagine you're not living in filth &amp; squalor and you have stocked shelves and your kids are happy to be there. They will see this quite quickly and most likely write it off as a malicious call. So I wouldn't worry too much.

It may also be worth notifying your local police - it is totally legitimate to call on the non-emergency number (usually 101, may be different depending on where you live) and say that you are suffering malicious communication via social media. They get a ton of those calls so you wouldn't be the only one. It is technically a civil matter but I think usually police will attend due to their being potential harassment. 

You could even say that you don't want any action taken at present but wanted the police to be aware should anything escalate. Entirely up to you though. If you do this make sure you're saving screen shots of everything said by your sister in law. In fact that's worth doing everything. Messages, statuses, everything. If you have a copy and things do go down a legislative route it is worth having this to back you up.

[This comment covers the recent World Cup scandal very neatly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/36wmwz/eli5_why_is_everyone_against_qatar_hosting_the/crhq4m0)

&gt; Essentially its the rampant corruption that has plagued the whole selection of Qatar from start to finish. But here are some of the worse reasons why Qatar sucks as a choice.
The games have typically (always?) been played in the summer break months of the european leagues of June and July. In Qatar the temperature can hit 45C (with 50C not being unheard of). This is bad for both the players and those watching in the stadiums. For those not fortunate enough to get tickets but still travelling to the country to enjoy the atmosphere and watching the game on a big screen, outside with zero shade this is also very bad (Add alcohol dehydration and this only gets worse).

&gt; The country has a population of about 2 million, with 2 major metropolitan centres. It is expected that a million travellers can travel to watch the world cup. Does the country have both the shelter and the infrastructure to deal with a 50% increase in population? Many impartial people are sceptical.
They don't have the stadiums...yet. Which is why they are basically importing workers from India, china, Nepal and North Korea (yes THAT North Korea) and quite literally working them to death. Qatari law says you are only allowed to work x number of hours a day outside and those hours may not be during the hottest of the day. They are forgetting to apply these rules to the foreign workers they have imported. They are also forgetting that they have to pay these people (in the case of North Korea they are just paying the North Korean government a 'fee' per worker and bypassing the worker altogether!) Not only are they ""forgetting"" to pay alot of the workers but they take their passport as a condition of work (""we will look after that for you, it would be terrible if you lost it"") and then making workers waive their backpay when they want to leave the country. They have also lost a huge number of workers due to quite literally working their ""slaves"" into the ground and ignoring any health and safety.

&gt; This is just a quick list of why alot of people are against Qatar, add to this the fact that people are advised not to do anything homosexual, drink alcohol outside of designated areas and did I mention the rampant corruption surrounding the whole thing?",null,0,null,1432718909,null,0,1432719326,0,crmbpo7,null,t3_37fbfb,null,t1_crmbpo7,null,t1_crmaqa0,null,null,null,1433291566,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Guardiola started managing at the same time as him.  While he had the luxury of being at Barca and Bayern do you think he would be allowed extra time because he was a young manager?  Sediment over last years 2nd place could, and I feel, will hold the club back two or three years now. I feel hes still not learning from his mistakes.  I was in the camp of keep him if we couldn't get Klopp but Sunday was the tipping point and I feel the clean break is needed.

A new manager wont have the shadow of Gerard and Carragher over there shoulder and will be given a real chance to start a new.  Rodgers own stubbornness is his biggest flaw. Come the new season he will have to hit the ground running. The reason is as from what I have seen the supporter base isnt spilt like earlier in the season a sizable majority now want him out. Results will change that and if we dont pick them up early it will be curtains. I proper big name signing will help but that we be more on FSG but it is needed to help him.

No-one knows and it doesn't really matter anyway).

The ""1990s"" levels is a pipe dream that'll never happen, the underlying economy has moved on since then.  What is needed are two (somewhat related) goals: one is the socio-economic goal of having a housing market actually home the people, but everyone voted against that in the election, so that won't happen for another five years or more; second is for the housing market to reach a natural equilibrium and not being such a drain on all forms of investment, this is needed for there to ever be a genuine prolonged economic recovery.

As for your question as to whether a ""crash"" (see paragraph one, I'll interpret this as ""sustained decline in prices"") is technically possible.  The answer is yes, it's very easily possible, just not necessarily imminent.  There's plenty of evidence the market (the bottom of the market especially) is above it's equilibrium levels, getting their by speculation; a £1 drop wouldn't be enough to bring it within reach of the wannabe-buyers, it would be more than that.

There's actually quite a lot of circumstances that might cause a sustained decline in prices, even without an increase in new builds, some more likely than others: higher interest rates, an unexpected recession (previous recessions actually helped, due to lower rates, getting lower from zero would be tricky); the growth of other investment opportunities meaning fewer foreign ""investors"" interested in UK property.  All of these are structural changes that couldn't easily be replaced by a few frustrated buyers with large deposits.

On the other hand, what circumstances could cause continued growth in prices: actual owner-occupiers with larger incomes, even more foreign buyers (some sort of crisis elsewhere), government giving everyone interest free mortgages?  It's a smaller list.

Fair play, this season's performance is inexcusable and it prompts people to think that Rodger's has been found out. What I also firmly believe is that last season was so extraordinary, there was always zero chance of replicating that form.

Klopp is indeed a superior manager to Rodgers, having won the Bundesliga and coming within a game of Champions League glory, he has big game experience. And his attitude and personality certainly fits Liverpool's lore, the rich history, the connection to the fans, and his penchant for dramatic comebacks (Malaga two years ago).

Klopp is one of the hottest coaches in world football right now, and every club would be better off with him as the manager, but when you mention the Crystal Palace, Stoke, Villa, West Ham, Hull... just remember Dortmund's league position this year and their form (they were in the relegation zone not too long ago).

&gt;Membership of the European Union is undemocratic because the European Commission, which is unelected, has the monopoly of proposing all EU legislation which it does in secret. It also has the power to issue regulations which are automatically binding in all member states.

Well firstly the Commissioners are appointed by member states and the President of the Commission is appointed by the biggest party in the European parliament.  So its representative democracy and is not to dis-similar to our Westminster cabinet and party leader system. 

Secondly the EC does not have a monopoly, I would say that power remains with the Council of the EU which use QMV system which is a democratic system. Though the EC does write legislation it is often just writing on what the council has already decided, and its not done in secret you can access most documents on the EC website, including TTIP negotiations. 

Finally it cannot issue regulations without European Parliament approval and sometimes QMV. So there not automatically binding. 

Look if you want to debate on why we should leave the EU that is fine, but make sure the things you suggest are the realities.

December - cut out sugar and sugary food e.g most cereal, bread, juice

January - start exercise - C25K

Feb - start calorie tracking with MFP (1500 cal/day), cut down on all carbs e.g. pasta and potatoes and sadly most alcohol.  Eggs for breakfast, Salad for lunch etc.  Join weight loss club at work (free).

May - starting to train for 10K fun runs of which there are a gazillion in  June / July.  This is amazing as at the end of Jan I couldn't run 400m without retching.

I think the big things for me are not eating back the exercise calories, and also my other half is also losing weight at the same time (she's doing 5:2 and it works for her).  I'm now at a BMI of about 27, down from almost 32.  Still looking to lose another stone or so.

EDIT - I think swimming is great for weight loss but it can tire you out more quickly than running, esp if like most people you are not a great swimmer.

Klopp also lost a world class striker, and was basically in the same position as us at the beginning of the season (though it's not that fair of a comparison given we spent over 100m). I'm not comparing this season to last season because I understand that last season was definitely an outlier. I'm comparing the beginning of this season to the end of this season, is there really any difference? We are still the same struggling side we were then with no signs of improvement. One of the biggest issues I have is I have absolutely no faith in BR to actually bring in the right players to make us a side who can compete again. There is a complete disconnect between the transfer committee and BR. If BR continues to freeze out transfer committee players like Markovic and Ballotelli how can we possibly succeed, especially when his own choice of signings have been just as poor. People seem to think signing a striker will fix our situation. It wont. There are much bigger problems than just a lack of striker. We won't be able to sign a striker anywhere near the quality of Suarez, or with the attributes Suarez has. Given Brs preference to play with a single striker, I highly doubt we will go back to a diamond midfield with 2 strikers due to this. BR has already come out saying we aren't looking for a winger, but we have no wingers who are actually a threat in front of goal.

Being somewhat risk averse, I do like the idea of saving from a debt-free position, which means getting rid of the mortgage first and then focusing on investing the bulk of my disposable income thereafter. 

That said, it sounds to me like maximising my pension contributions first, then looking into s&amp;s NISA, and putting any leftover income into a VTC would be the way to go? Is there a general consensus on what VTC is best for long term? I hear Vanguard mentioned a lot here. And what about brokers?

null,false,going_dicey,null,null,null,"/u/grodecki has the right advice. You need to 100% make sure you get everything in writing (in terms of your plans). When it comes closer to purchase, make sure you consult a solicitor regarding the best way for your guys to own the property etc (joint tenancy, tenants in common, a holding company, etc). You'll need to consider questions like what happens if one of you wants to sell and the other doesn't, etc? You will each need to instruct separate solicitors for this advice, as you will each have competing interests.

Is that £20,000 representative of your combined total savings? Or do you have a rainy day fund? Additional savings? You should make sure you could comfortably make 6 months of mortgage payments and subsist if things hit the fan. Will you have any money left to repair the boiler? Fix the roof when the freeholder sends you a bill? I'm presuming you do have other savings, because you noted this is just what's in a joint savings account.

I can't advise you enough against the Help to Buy Scheme. You should not leverage 95% of your home. That's just plain stupid. When interest rates rise even slightly, your mortgage payments will change drastically. I personally wouldn't recommend touching a property without at least 20% down. Have you done a buy vs rent calculator accounting for the differences in buying with 5%, 10%, and 20% down?  Don't think of a 10% deposit as a 'full deposit'. Think of a 10% deposit as the absolute minimum the bank is willing to lend on. It doesn't automatically mean that it is the 'correct' way to buy a flat. I think the only time one should even consider the help to buy scheme is if you are buying the property for life. That is, you know you will be at that flat for the next 30+ years. Its not a fantastic first step on the ladder.

When looking at a mortgage, be cautious of low rates. A mortgage with a 1.7% interest rate sounds fantastic, but you only get that rate for 2 years. If you have a 25 year term, that 1.7% rate only really effects you for 8% of the mortgage term. Make sure you consider the advantages of fixed rates, trackers, variables, etc. Run the numbers in a spreadsheet and see which works best for your situation. 

I don't mean any of this to come off as harsh (only trying to be helpful!) but you need to thoroughly consider all the variables that go into buying. From the sounds of it, you and your flatmate have a healthy combined income (that I presume will increase in the coming few years). Presuming that you guys can save £11k each, per year for the next 3-4 years...why not consider the following:

Both open a Help to Buy ISA when they come out and max out for three years. You'll have an extra £6k to spend on a house from that plus an extra £66,000 in savings accrued from the 3 years of saving @ £22k per year. This doesn't factor in any earned interest. You'll have nearly £100k as a deposit. 

Renting sucks but don't feel like rushing to buy a flat is always the better option.  Renting comes with advantages. Your landlord is responsible for repairs, you have flexibility and you only have 1.5 months of rent tied up as a deposit (not 10%+ the value of the house). Buying a flat (especially a London leasehold) comes with service charges, ground rent, common area repair bills and then the hassle + expense of a lease extension (if that's the route that you wanted to take). Suffice it to say, regardless of the decision you make, proceed slowly. There's no rush.

*Jobs of this size are scarce, especially so for British managers, and if he tarnishes himself at Anfield any more he would likely preclude himself from ever returning to this level again.*

This sums up the salient issue. Rodgers has some talent, but got over promoted, got caught out. If he stays for another season and its more of the same, he might do his career irreparable damage, and he's seen as a laughing stock. If he steps out for a few months and then tries again at a lower tier team, he can rebuild and take time out of the spotlight to learn from his mistakes (and they've been doozies). Doing a David Moyes for the sake of his career might not be so bad, you know?

As for the general principle of cyclists killing people. Sure it happens. Not sure anyone's said otherwise.

Firstly, the doctor was completely unprofessional and I hope the guy put in a professional complaint. I have been on PEP. It is categorically untrue that you have to report a rape to get the drugs. It is vital that the drug is taken within 3 days of exposure, otherwise it is not effective against preventing HIV. The drug is freely available at A&amp;E services - this is where people should go.

Lastly, nearly all rape counselling services are women only. SurvivorsUK is the only one which exclusively caters for men. It is a really vital service given that men are already marginalised and silenced when it comes to talking about rape. I used their online service which was where I was able to talk about it for the first time.

null,false,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"In regards to the mortgage, you can only claim the interest portions of the mortgage as a tax deductible expense, not the capital. 

If you pay a management company their fees are deductible as is the stationary down to a single sheet of paper and mileage for any travel to do with the rental property - claim the HMRC rate of 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles. You can claim advertising costs and search fees if you don't have the agency finding you new tenants. Everything needs to be receipted and in the case of travel, each journey recorded in case HMRC decide to do an audit. 

Have you registered with HMRC? They'll give you two options, to adjust your PAYE tax code or to do self assessment. Do self assessment.

IF YOU ARE NOT ON AN INTEREST ONLY MORTGAGE CHANGE IT TO ONE NOW. Do not get a standard repayment mortgage. The reason why is because due to the fact only the interest portion of a mortgage is tax deductible you can end up in the position where your mortgage payments are such that you end up having to pay the tax bill out of your PAYE income or you have a repair bill and end up not only having to find the money for the repair out of your PAYE income but your tax bill out of your PAYE income as well. The whole idea is to have the property earn sufficient income to not only service the mortgage but also pay your tax bill and repairs out of it without requiring funding from elsewhere so the best way to do it by far from a money earning point of view is to go on interest only and pocket more of the rent. You can choose whether or not to repay some of the capital every year but beware that by doing so it lowers the mortgage interest payment and any savings you make in your case you'll lose 40% of in income tax.

These are all the major referendums ever held in the UK, with the questions and answers for all I could find (had some hiccups with the GLA.)

There's no provision to insist upon any question or answer in particular, though for practical reasons the Electoral Commission must agree that the proposal is fair. The general rules on referendums in the UK are being set as time proceeds on an ad hoc basis, and will be determined most of all by precedence.

It's interesting to note that in hindsight the majority of these are referred to simply as [Yes/No](http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/elections/referendums-held-in-the-uk/) even by Parliament themselves, and the choices are usually binary. The past referendum on the European Community was represented as a Yes/No answer, so it is at least consistent. Politically it's easier to get people to vote Yes or No, and it's easier to campaign around and create materials in favour of them.

It's also possible, if unlikely, that the government may stipulate that the turnout must reach a certain level for the decision to be acted upon (as with the Scottish referendum of 1979.) Either way, they can choose what they like, but precedence and recent referendums does makes a Yes/No question and answer far more likely.

Hasn't let me down yet and I've been complemented on it a few times.

null,false,avapoet,null,null,null,"No; a referendum can ask any question and offer any options that the government chooses, subject to the successful passing of the bill that authorises it. I'm not aware of any example in the history of the UK that hasn't been of the ""Yes/No"" format, though.

Asking a question with exactly two possible answers has benefits, of course. For a start, it means that (assuming a First Past The Post counting mechanism is used and the number of spoiled ballots is low or not counted) the answer with the plurality has the majority, and that there's no benefit to strategic voting. To examine this, for example, let's consider the following hypothetical referendum question: ""Should the UK remain part of the EU? (a) Yes, as-is, (b) Yes, but with changes, (c) No, we should leave."" This is a seriously broken (FPPT) referendum question, because the ""Yes"" vote risks being split between options (a) and (b), which leaves the ""No"" answer significantly more-likely to be chosen than would be the case if it were simply a ""Yes/No"" question. A multi-answer referendum question must be very-carefully designed, and the risk to its designer of being accused of manipulating the phasing to their own agenda is huge.

Given, then, that a referendum question ought to have two answers, the next question is - ""Why Yes/No?"" It seems that this is just the simplest possible expression of a two-answer question! Anything else you might phrase it as carries semantic meaning that might not be intended, or risks not being fully understood by the voter. Yes/No is just a simple way of putting things. ""Remain in/Leave"" is feasible, sure, but it doesn't give any significant benefit over ""Yes/No"" and uses more, longer words to say the same thing.

Personally, I've always been of the opinion that referendum questions should be phrased such that the ""No"" answer always represents the status quo, and the ""Yes"" answer represents a change. This has strong precedent: it's exactly how the Wales and Scottish devolution questions, the Scottish independence question, the directly-elected mayors questions, the Good Friday agreement referendum etc. were phrased. For that reason, I think that the referendum on EU membership should be phrased as something like ""Should the United Kingdom *leave* the European Union? Yes/No."" As referendums seem to be becoming more-common, in recent decades, I think that it's important that we standardise how they're laid-out, and ""no = status quo, yes = change"" seems to be a logical and well-precedented way of doing that. Unfortunately it looks like the government disagrees with me, and ""yes"" will be the 'retain the status quo' answer in the EU membership referendum. Ah well.

**tl;dr: No, a referendum can ask any question it likes and collect answers from any set it likes. However, there are great reasons to have only two options and, given that, good reasons for these options to be ""yes"" and ""no"". Traditionally, a ""no"" vote has generally been in favour of the status quo and a ""yes"" vote in favour of change, and this referendum looks likely to counteract that trend.**",null,0,null,1432723891,null,0,false,0,crmcwlo,null,t3_37fwe2,null,t1_crmcwlo,null,t3_37fwe2,null,null,null,1433292128,null,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8,null

The problem here is people are judging him on stats he has achieved with Burnley a team that have just been relegated. Plus that 12m price tag is quite a lot for a player out of contract, I'd imagine as other people are too, that it is a combined fee for Trippier too.

United will be the most interesting one for sure, they got the winger they badly needed. Add in a CB (Otamendi or Gaitan), central midfielder and a striker. Would not be surprised if they spent over 100m as well. 

I totally agree on that, that as a team we need someone like Suarez, Torres or Gerrard. But those type of players are not everywhere and we got to pay a high amount of cash to get players like that. I think the most important thing is to remove the weaknesses we got in the team, that is a striker, DM and RB. After filling those positions we can think about that special player. The way for our team to really shine is to have a fantastic squad, where players like Markovic, Ibe, Origi etc can shine with their talent.

Yes, because on this particular item we dont know enough about what happend address the issues.

On those merits that the end of it. And anything else is to off topic.

Though, hypothetically heres a thought - it's not unusual for pedestrians to vear past the line on the shared path into a cyclists path. Can we blame the cyclist for that if it happens quickly, with little or no time to react? It's a fairly common thing, and in that case it's not cyclists that need educating. 




&gt;I could invite you to spend just one afternoon in several Birmingham locations and we could watch dangerous cyclists. I wish I were exaggerating.

Many road users flout the law. Im sure in Birmingham you could easily hang around a 20/30mph area and watch every 2nd car break the speed limit too. Hang around long enough and Im sure you will see your fair share of phone use too.

Is education an issue here, do people not know phone use is illegal, speeding and what not too?

So whats the real solution...Fines and prison time? I'm totally onboard with that - lets start throwing the book at people, remove their right to drive, and fine cyclists into oblivion. But for that to happen we need police to catch people (cyclists and motorists). And I fear that won't be happening any time soon.

&gt;More education and accountability is needed

Never had an issue with accountability. I think i've said to you before I have no time for any antisocial anything (including cycling). Its why I think strict liability is important, but given that's massively misunderstood, I dont see that happening anytime soon either.

Ings is/was potentially a decent option at a decent price who can do a job in the Prem now, could still develop into a great player in the future and would fit into how BR wants us to play. He wouldn't want crazy wages and would be willing to be a backup to Sturridge. Plus would allow us to maximise funds for another first 11 striker.

It was all done in a very dirty manner.

Tory backbench MPs didn't know what they were voting on but (I think) they were told to vote in favour. Labour and LD whips had a job getting everyone back to parliament to block the change.

**Good stuff:**

- Minimum wage workers being taken out of income tax

- Right to Buy will mandate associations replace every unit they sell under the scheme, with the government stepping in to make up the cash difference

- Welfare cap down to £23k from £26k. I think councils should move people on benefits to cheaper areas anyhow to save the taxpayer money. Nobody should have that much housing benefit in zones 1-2 of London.

- NI, VAT, and Income Tax will not increase. Awesome.

- Free childcare up to 30hrs a week from 15. Great for parents of toddlers.

- 200,000 starter homes available to under 40s at a 20% discount. Good start although more is required.

- Devolution to cities, including a new mayor of Greater Manchester.

- HS2 finally moving ahead after so many delays.

- Devolution to Scotland and Wales.

- Strike vote legislation to rein in public service union strikes. Good.

- Banning of the use of prison cells to temporarily detain the mentally ill.

.
**Bad stuff:**

- Immigration bill is pretty toothless, but without EU treaty reform not much can be done anyhow.

- Snoopers Charter is back. I don't support this.

TOTW2 is marketed at people looking to ride faster, however it has some great advice about how to corner, what you should do if you go in too fast / need to slow down ect. The more you know how to control the bike, the more you can focus on the road.

It has a conical gearbox, if you don't know how to make best use of it (no clutch required to upshift) look up some tutorials on youtube once you're comfortable on the bike.

Its a real bike, will do 84mph on a flat with you hugging the tank. She will fly up to 60mph. This means if you haven't already, go buy yourself some decent leathers / boots. Make this a very high priority. As a bonus, you will get more respect as a rider, especially from the police.

Its very forgiving, grips more than you think, if you so wish you can get your knee down

I assume you've got a service package with it for the first 3 services? Its really important to get the oil changed after the first 600 miles!

Also, some point in the future you will likely want a new exhaust. You will likely get about 1mph added to your top speed from one. All they do is change the sound, which is nice, but don't expect any performance increase.

---

Saving for a deposit is always the hardest part, but no matter how small it is, once you have a house which is partially paid off you can use that as a deposit when you trade-up to something larger.

As such, very rarely is anyone able to get onto the housing ladder at the rung they intend to spend the rest of their lives at. You're unlikely to be able to afford your ideal home with the first property you buy so consider starting smaller.

Some options might be...

* Buying something smaller than you would ideally like but which has room for an extension (loft, second story on a bungalow, extend into/over the garage, extend into the garden, etc.)
* Something in a worse area than you'd prefer (but an area which is improving as this will massively help your home increase in value long-term)
* Get a house which is derelict / run-down which needs a lot of renovation work.

...At the very least I'd suggest doing the final two. Buy a run-down house on the edge of a rough neighborhood.

Germany has introduced rent controls this year in areas of severe ""housing shortage"". This caps rents to 110% of a reference rent set by the local council for a representative type of property.

Amm not all groups are equal. Straight away last time, they had Germany in their group.

France didn't make it out of the group in 2002, Italy didn't make it out of the group in 2010 (who finished below New Zealand), Spain played like shit in 2014, 7-1 etc. Upsets and strange things happen in world cups all the time, it's not new. 

&gt;Yedlin is a project hence Poch isn't playing him 

I don't think you advance players by not playing them..... Maybe I'm mistaken, who knows. Why play Dier at all instead of Faz? Or Kane instead of Soldado or Ade? Both are young, both are playing.... because they are the better option. If Yedlin were the better option, wouldn't Poch be playing him? But na let's just put Kane on the bench, he's clearly a project.

&gt;(Remember Poch tried not to play ANY of his new signings at firat, Dier was by force, he likes to integrate slowly)

Uhhh..... How so? He didn't bring Dier on as a sub, he started him at CB against west ham and put him on the right because Naughton was sent off (first game of the season). Second game of the season, started Davies (new signing).

LFC has global revenues &amp; even with offloading top players, even without success, LFC has hugely increased in value so FSG can make a big profit when they sell. FSG wouldn't have saved a small club. They are just in it for personal profit.

Whilst I agree about the comments section generally and the comment being out of context/inappropriate on this article, this isn't calling for FSG's heads but stating an opinion, which probably isn't far off the truth.  I don't think they're looking to 'pump &amp; dump' but they are possibly managing Liverpool FC to be an eventual profit-generating business rather than an aspirational football club/rich plaything.

I'm not arguing with your point, I think we're on the same side.

Just pointing out that your examples seem pretty silly and/or scaremonger-y. 

You say things like that and mums on facebook might panic and share it once, next to their ""you know your a mother when"" posts and ""accidental but still true"" britain first posts, but a lot of people will just shut off because they think it sounds idiotic. 

Examples like search histories and private messages and recorded phonecalls or the ability to activate microphones at will are more true, make more sense, and are a lot scarier to the average person. And not saying ""they are always doing it"" but instead going along the route of ""they can and they will if they want to"" is once more true *and* scary.

Saying ""they're going to film you in the shower!"" is not a productive way to get the message across at all. 

This is literally an issue of the facts being scarier than the over exaggerated scaremongering. 

I mean using CCTV and the fact that we have so bloody many cameras as an example. What is more true and more threatening?

""They can film you on the toilet!""

or 

""They can film you through CCTV and follow you literally anywhere you go. They can track every move you make, take record of every address you go to and every path you use to get there.""

Just checking, this is because you need a car and don't have the cash for it, rather than you're planning to get a loan to improve your ""credit rating"" (as much as it exists in the UK).

In terms of improving your credit, different companies use different measures and combinations to work out if they want to led to you. Use your money and credit sensibly, don't default on things and just have a credit history (direct debits going out without problem, be on the electoral register)

&gt; I'm just wondering if/when I apply for finance (loans/mortgages/credit cards etc) what I should say my salary is.

Check with who you intend to borrow from, they should specify what they need to know.

You also don't have to deal with landlords and you treat the house as yours for the duration of the loan. It gives you a toe hold on the property ladder because it's relatively easy to switch from an interest only mortgage to a capital mortgage, compared from renting to capital. It's also usually cheaper than renting.

(It sounds a lot deeper when your riding it, be warned ;) )

I should have said leathers or textiles, both are great, as long as you have the correct gear.

I also recommend getting some advanced rider training. Look into IAM (Insitute of Advanced Motorists) at http://www.iam.org.uk/

If you're on a budget, you should be able to find some friendly bikers that will assess your riding for a cup of coffee and a bit of petrol money.

Overall, the sooner you can get more training than just a CBT, the more it will pay off.

&gt;The Tory manifesto pledged the party would include “a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions”. However, the background note to the Queen's Speech makes clear that the new bill will introduce “a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of of trade union subscriptions”.

So fucking what? If the law is applied equally, then it doesn't matter. I can offend whoever I want. One might argue that a homosexual could go to a Christian bakery just to offend their sensibilities.

So lets try another equivalent one:

* Neo Nazis go to a Jewish bakery and ask for a swastika cake
* Jew goes to a Muslim bakery and asks for a cake with the Star of David on with the words ""FUCK PALESTINE""
* What about a gay couple asking for a wedding cake from a Muslim bakery (they exist!)

I think this all could have been avoided if the proprietors of the Christo cake shop had not given a reason for not making the cake. I mean, businesses can refuse to business without an explanation, right?

I'd expect that any profit made inside the company would be dropped immediately by 20% for corporation tax, then dividends tax would be payable when you're paying yourself (I assume you're doing that, rather than paying yourself a large salary). There will also be implications of the company owning those shares not you, so if you're sued (say) then those could be at risk.

Speak to your accountant!

Do you not see that as scaremongering? 

Whilst I don't necessarily agree with the ""nothing to hide"" stance, it's not like they're filming everyone at every given moment, or reading all of our juicy gossip. It's silly to think any government has the capacity to record, watch, or store every single piece of information at every given time. The key aspect of it is the ""if they want to"" part. 

Which is really if they have to. 

So saying you've nothing to hide is not in any way near similar to saying ""film me in the shower"" and to make arguments like *that* is scaremongering, is over exaggerated and is just down right silly. 



I don't think the government should be allowed to do any snooping without reason, but I'm not going to make overblown statements like anyone that doesn't believe me or take the same stance as me is stupid. 


And it's not splitting hairs if it's what they said. If someone says something stupid and I say what they said is stupid it's not splitting hairs.

If this thread is going to go the route of most threads where people just follow the fickle reddit downvote train I don't mind, but as long as one person reads this and thinks ""hey, they need to be stopped from snooping but they're not actually filming me in the shower"" then I'll take it.

for instance, the weight and measures act of 1985 forbid selling agricultural produce by the bushel. so after that, if you were selling it by the bushel, scale or no scale, you were in violation of the law. it has nothing to do with the scales.

later versions of the act forbid selling certain items by the pound or gallon or whatever, regardless of what scales you were using. the scale is not the issue, although some cases were about using out of date scales, that is not what the law is about.

You sound pleasant. You're correct though, because everyone has the right to be an arsehole. You should think about the implications of this right.

It's rare in this country for businesses to state explicitly that they are run by Christians (inb4 you pull up a load of carefully searched for examples to prove me wrong), so I highly doubt the couple in question were doing this to inflict the dreaded gayness on poor unsuspecting religious types. I also doubt that instances of this are going on unreported. Also, the rights of people not to be offended because of their bullshit religion are trumped by the human right to be gay, or any kind of sexuality. 

Why you are defending people who have singled out and refused the business of a gay couple, and using it as a stick to beat hypothetical Muslims, is beyond me. I might have a hard-on for Islam, you seem to have a hard-on for homophobia.

null,false,manhattan4,null,null,null,"Off the top of my head i can think of a number of reasons:

* A roof garden would need to be a flat roof &amp; flat roofs are shit. They are susceptible to ponding (and potentially ingress) of rain water unless carefully laid to fall, and sloping surfaces beyond a certain gradient are better at dissipating water but are unpleasant to walk on. Failure of roofing membranes is not uncommon, so much so that areas of flat roof need to be disclosed to insurers when taking out a policy. They also provide less efficient use of structural material than a triangulated (pitched) roof, which brings me onto the next issue, structural design.
* Flat roofs are traditionally VERY lightweight construction to achieve a large enough span without a very deep structural zone. A roof garden is very heavy loading, both in terms of the required build-up (ie. sufficiently deep soil for rooting) as well as the difficult to determine live-load (ie. the weight of vegetation). Substituting a traditional single-ply membrane timber flat roof with a roof garden spanning the same distance will likely require the timber structure to be replaced with something far more substantial such as precast concrete planks. This will transfer load to every supporting element below, potentially resulting in thicker / higher strength supporting walls, high capacity lintels over openings and increased foundation widths to spread the increased load over a greater area to achieve an acceptable bearing pressure on the ground. As a comparison, a roof garden will add a far higher load per square meter than a standard domestic floor, not to mention that habitable areas give a far greater monetary return than a roof garden would. So financially there's greater build-cost for less return.
* Building a garden over a flat roof reduces the accessibility to maintain / repair the roofing membrane which is required to keep water out of the building. Since this is one of the most common areas of failure in a building, it is best to keep it accessible.


I have never designed a roof garden (ie. soft landscaping on a roof) but have done a number of green roofs (formerly grasses, now its more commonly sedum) although green roofs are traditionally pitched for drainage reasons and inaccessible to protect the plants. Again, these green roofs add a considerable amount of weight over a traditional roof, but this is minimised due to the type of planting requiring shallow rooting substrates &amp; zero maintenance.

null,false,MrBeardyMan,null,null,null," &gt; I've heard that the prescription in the UK costs about 8 Pounds - is it the full cost paid at pharmacy or are there any extra payments needed when obtaining the drugs in the drug store?

Full cost. In fact if you are getting a regular supply you can [pre-pay](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/PPC.aspx) for a years drugs for ~£104 that will cover ALL precscribed drugs for the year. 

&gt; How do i setup an apointment to the psychiatrist? Do i need to take with me my translated medical history of my illness to have a proof or does my word about my condition will be enough?

First step will be to register with a GP. If you know where you will be living it may be worth calling a local surgery now to confirm what requirements will be for bringing in your medical notes. Your GP will be able to refer you to a psychiatrist and will be your first point of call for ongoing drug management and any other health problems.

&gt; Do i need some kind of prescription to have the injection administered by a nurse or can i just go without any papers and have it done?

Your GP surgery will be able to answer this. I've had drugs administered by as nurse at my GP office before that I brought with me ... but they were from a prescription that a GP at that surgery wrote. I suspect they will be reluctant to administer anything until you have registered and talked to a GP at the surgery first so they know what they are getting into.

&gt; and last question if I may ask: I've heard you have to answer some questions about your health when going to a new job.

Does not always happen but some places do ask - it may be that it is becoming a standard question so companies can ensure they are dealing with the health and safety needs of all employees. Try not to lie, is never a good starting point, but you don't have to give them an answer either! Might be worth considering an answer like: ""I'm not really comfortable talking about my health with somebody I've just met.

Some thieves have stolen copper wire from overhead lines between York and Doncaster overnight. The engineering team are called out. The section has no electricity and no trains passing through. No trains travel between York and Doncaster means massive problems on these lines and trains are being rerouted. A replacement bus service is used between York and Leeds. 

Massive delays from Leeds to the south. More trains are put onto the lines to saturation. Advanced seat reservations are stopped. Everything travels at the same speed rather than 125mph and 60 mph. Signalling problems occur and a rogue timetable is put into place. 

Trains from Peterborough to the north also has problems. Delays at Kings cross. 

First Capital connect service from Kings Cross to Cambridge doesn't travel to Doncaster. It gets delayed. The return service is delayed. Passengers wonder why this service is delayed. Answer? Overhead lines between York and Doncaster 150 miles away. 

The Train operators make announcements like ""We are sorry for the delay due to overhead line problems between York and Doncaster which has impacted all services running on the East Coast Main Line. We suggest passengers traveling from London to the north travel from Euston or St Pancras and change at Birmingham or Manchester and seek alternative routes.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"&gt;My thoughts are that if my company bought index funds, rather than me taking a huge consultation fee then buying them after my personal income tax, it would save me £400,000 in tax annually.

If you're paying £400,000 a year in tax you can afford to take proper advice, rather than ask the internet whose opinions are variable and often horribly misinformed.

&gt;Ultimately, I could cease my regular ""money making"" part of the business if things go wrong, and just draw from the company, which draws from the index funds, for a personal income...
&gt;Is this a huge legal tax dodge I've found, or have I made a mistake?

Your company can claim a deduction when computing its liability to Corporation Tax for non-capital expenses incurred for the purpose of earning profits derived of its trading activities.

Unless your company is trading in index funds and/or other similar assets it's not an expense incurred in the course of earning trading income.  Your company can invest in them, but you'll get no deduction before tax.  When your company disposes of them, any increase in value will be liable to tax.  If the company disposes of them by giving them to you under market value the company will calculate its tax using market value *(so it's still liable to tax)* and you will be taxed on the difference.  Depending on how this occurs it might be taxed as a distribution *(a dividend, more or less)* or as as earnings.

You made a mistake.  Your problem is that you don't understand the very basics of how tax is calculated.  If avoiding tax was that simple it wouldn't be a huge, expensive industry.


&gt;*EDIT: This is a side question, but still relevant to this (sort of), could I buy a residentual property (in cash) with the company's profits that I intend on personally living in? 

Yep.  And unless your company trades in property it will be a capital investment not incurred in order to earn profits from its trade.  So, no deduction when calculating the tax liability.

&gt;I could pay the company a rent (waaaaaaaaay less than its rentable value, like maybe a pound a month), and chalk it down to a ""bad property investment"" that the company made?

Yes, you could.  The company would be providing you with a benefit, which would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the value of the benefit provided and the amount you made good.  You would be liable to income tax and NICs and the company would be liable to NICs.

At the point you claim those deductions and then you *(in your capacity of company director)* tell a tax inspector it was just a, ""bad property investment"" you'll likely be liable to not only the tax you attempted to avoid, plus interest, but also a penalty based on Deliberate behaviour of up to 70% of the tax you attempted to avoid under Sch. 24 of the Finance Act 2007.

Assuming you haven't stopped paying attention by here, on the basis that you didn't hear what you wanted, there's something I'd like you to consider:  You probably don't feel you're getting value for money from paying huge amounts of tax.

This is the main problem, you have **no rights** because they can reduce your hours to 0 without reason.

It's the problem my partner faces, she gets walked all over but can't do anything or face loosing hours. Solution? Get another job... But that's easier said than done, especially when everywhere is 0 hours.

null,false,subreddit_llama,null,null,null,"&gt;It's rare in this country for businesses to state explicitly that they are run by Christians (inb4 you pull up a load of carefully searched for examples to prove me wrong), so I highly doubt the couple in question were doing this to inflict the dreaded gayness on poor unsuspecting religious types. I also doubt that instances of this are going on unreported. Also, the rights of people not to be offended because of their bullshit religion are trumped by the human right to be gay, or any kind of sexuality. 

So you've already admitted that there will be bakeries that advertise their Christian status. I agree with you on the right's of a homosexual should outweigh the baseless bronze-age beliefs of some bigots. What I don't agree with is your assertion that the customer's motivation should play a role in whether or not they have a right to be served.


&gt;Why you are defending people who have singled out and refused the business of a gay couple, and using it as a stick to beat hypothetical Muslims, is beyond me. I might have a hard-on for Islam, you seem to have a hard-on for homophobia.

I'm saying that what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. I happen to live near to a large Muslim community and have seen first hand how they treat homosexuals from their own community. In short, it is not great. I wonder if this case would have made a big a dent in the media had it been two gay men trying to get some cakes from a Muslim bakery. Ian Hislop is correct in saying that this law means that religious beliefs cannot be used to deny doing business with somebody and used the Muslim example - note how you ignore the Jews in my example, but hey, its obvious you hate them you big anti-semite (wow, making baseless accusations of bigotry *is* fun. That's why you do it!).

I'm not trying to beat Muslims over the head with anything. I'm saying that this law means that I could go and order a picture of Mohammed on a cake (and if I don't say the Prophet Mohammed, they might do me Mohammed-Ali or Mo Farah, which is an acceptable get-out). I think that is fair enough, but I don't think that the law will be applied equally to all religions because people like you think the motivations of the customer are relevant or even provable. You're doing somersaults to try and show that Muslim bigotry is OK, because people are just trying to be mean to them about their holy-person.

The stupidest thing about all of this is that they could have avoided making the cake if they'd made up some bullshit excuse or just said ""no"" without giving a reason. Instead, they decided to make a ""righteous"" stand against gay people. In short, this law is going to be a nightmare to enforce and those cake-shop owners are idiots.",null,0,null,1432733086,null,0,false,0,crmg5ky,null,t3_37bkk6,null,t1_crmg5ky,null,t1_crmfdr1,null,null,null,1433293659,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

We've done it. We've actually done it. We've completely broken down the barriers of racism and built them back up again under the guise of non-racism. How? How is it even possible for a left group to go so far left they have completely 180'd and hit the right again. It makes no sense. 

After Ethnic minorities worked so hard to have rights and to not be ghettoized we have reached the point where *some groups want it back again.

Really?!?!?!?!?!? Sorry mate, I respectfully yet adamantly disagree. There were several games this season where we would win on sheer luck alone. The season where we finished second hinged on Suarez and Sturridge - one of them a world class player (easily one of the best in the world). Because we finished so high and the seasons before and after in a mediocre spot - I don't feel like the argument sticks that Brendan is a ""genius"" - a decent to good coach, maybe. As far as the comparison to Rodgers and Klopp goes - Klopp has won league titles, taken his team to the CL finals and fights competitively for silverware. BR hasn't YET accomplished that. I, personally, would prefer Klopp but in doing so would definitely need to understand that him taking the reigns wouldn't mean immediate club success but at least he has a record of providing clubs he manages exactly that. I still think Rodgers is a good coach but I agree with what many have said - Rodgers was good to have at the time from what was available and he is not a terrible coach but with someone with the quality of Klopp available you would at least have to entertain the idea of having him as our coach. All this said, I still don't think Liverpool will get him and if Brendan gets another year and repeats at the half of the table or lower - who knows who would be available then...you have to strike when the iron is hot. If that means a mediocre performance the first season with Klopp at the helm - I would rather next season be with him being more hopeful that the future will hold something more special for the club. To finish- I also think when players hear the name Klopp - they might be more convinced to come to the team, especially as it seems this end of the season the players had about given up on Rodgers and lets not dive into the whole Sterling debacle. Rumors are abundant but I wasn't too happy to hear that perhaps Sterling wasn't getting on too well with Rodgers either.",null,0,null,1432733703,null,0,false,0,crmgfxz,null,t3_37fhht,null,t1_crmgfxz,null,t3_37fhht,null,null,null,1433293796,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

No it doesn't. You are not making any sense. That line is not segregating different types of traffic. That line is marking one side of the road from another, for the benefit of motor vehicles only.

Your comment would only make sense if we got rid of all pavements and simply marked a white line where the road ends and the pavement begins. Do you know why we don't do that? Because it's fucking dangerous.

I ignored it because it was idiotic.

This is the crux of the matter and I think it makes all the difference.

Would you go into a Jewish bagel shop and demand to be served a bacon sandwich, simply because you have the right to be a massive dick about peoples' privately held, unharmful beliefs?

My girlfriend (she's a clinical lead in a hospital) recently did some research into 7-day care and concluded that it was vastly beneficial to patient wellbeing.. even if it would mean her working week was messed about.

However, when I asked her about it didn't sound like it needed a huge increase in staff.. just staff to be willing to work over weekends in exchange for other days off. Essentially it wasn't expected to increase the workload, just spread it out over the whole week.

The other benefit is that it would, in theory, reduce the overall workload because patient's conditions wouldn't deteriorate over weekends and so require less treatment overall. This gain could be reduced by people not dying over the weekend and so requiring further treatment.. but then that's not really a good argument against :/

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"Yeah, this whole season has made me lose any faith in Rodgers I had. Tactically he's been easily figured out by some of the most mediocre managers in the league. 

He doesn't attempt to fix issues until his back is completely against the wall. The first 3 months of trying the exact same formation, tactics and under-performing starters was insane. It took him until we'd played almost half of our games in the season to say ""okay, maybe I should try a new approach"". He even admitted he only changed it because he feared for his job too.

He did well in changing it, and that's exactly what we want from a manager. He tried something new and made it work. Great! Good job. That gave me hope he'd have learned his lesson to change up his tactics every now and then so we don't become ridiculously predictable. But he showed yet again how he's completely unwilling to fix a broken strategy when his new formation got figured out. He stuck with it again and results tanked for another 3 months. He did revert back to the same shit which was awful for the first 3 months though towards the end and it was unsurprisingly awful again.

He seems to be marmite to players. Some players absolutely love him, others hate him and can't wait to be free of him. All managers fall out with some players, but Reina, Agger, Sterling, Sahin, Carroll have all spoken out about him. There may be more I'm forgetting off the top of my head, but I imagine there are a few more in the club that might say something once they leave. 

He is an utter nightmare with PR. We all know it, it doesn't really need describing.

His substitutions  are dire. Absolutely awful. Once we go behind he has no idea what to do. He seems to just throw people on at random times and pray for the best. Often taking off some of our best performers and leaving on the ones having absolute mares.

Lastly he doesn't know when to play smart. For crucial games he doesn't tinker, or setup more defensively. We're just the same team every week, and we usually do shit against big teams because of it. Sometimes a game would benefit from us packing the midfield, or sitting back and hitting on the counter. We have the players for it. Sterling, Markovic, Coutinho, Ibe, Hendo, Lallana, Can etc All capable of surging forward and hitting hard and fast. But every game it's slow and patient build-up, allow the other team to setup defensively how they've practiced in preparation for us. Then run out of ideas in the final third when we can't break through their 2 holding midfielders and tight shape. 

I think Rodgers is a great coach in that he can really get the best out of quite a few players, but as an out-out manager he's quite average. His strengths as a coach don't outweigh his weaknesses as manager for me, and we should be looking elsewhere.

Edit: I'd also just like to say, I'm really grateful for him for last season and for his time here in general, and I don't have anything personal against him. I just feel like he's taken us as high as we could go with him already.

That reason is he's not better than Dier or Vlad in that position, otherwise he would be playing there regularly with Walker out.

I would argue that a gay person going into a Christian bakery and demanding that their union be recognised by practising Christians is exactly the same as what you're describing. Christianity doesn't have a great track record with gay people and is fairly clear about what it thinks of them in its scripture.

Who is to say that Muslims would make it clear that it was a Muslim bakery? Just as there are many chip shops owned by Muslims that don't cater exclusively to Muslims, so would there be cake shops.

We're obviously not going to get an answer between the two of us, so lets just wait until someone inevitably does one of the things I described and see how the law deals with it.

This though is the single worst way to calculate dangers between different modes of transport.


HGV are the safest sure, but they stack up miles away from people. When they enter a city, they become the most dangerous mode of transport going (well, other than busses).

Bikes also spend 99% of their times in towns and cities with people so that further compounds the problem of measuring in distance and not taking into account where and how they are used.


slight tangent - Sure I read somewhere to the space shuttle is actually the safest mode of transport based on distance traveled... but to quote wikipedia ""in-flight accidents have killed 18 astronauts, in four separate incidents"" . Does not sound all that safe, but it sure does lots of miles ;)

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"i did not say to fire him after one more season. if he fluffs up nearly as bad as he admittedly did this year, then yes. if he progresses again, he deserves to see out his contract. 

my criteria for firing him next season is not achieving 4th. until our stadium is built, i realistically don't expect us financially to be able to compete...although we did it last year, so very possible. i think 4th is very much still attainable. people keep talking about the strengthening of other clubs, but forget that we too can stregthen heavily this year. truly, we can. ffp has been eased, and that benefits us as well because fsg aren't fucking dick broke like most people here will lead you to believe. they own a 2billion dollar franchise in the red sox, and the boston globe (maybe 3rd or 4th in circulation behind new york times, washington post and maybe LA chronicle)...they have money, and connections to investors. they are smart business owners and I would be very surprised if we didn't spen less than 100m this summer ( maybe not net, but 100m nevertheless). 

Another thing people need to consider, BR has 3 years left on his contract at over 3m pounds/year. I don't know if people realize this, but when you release, or fire someone under contract like that, they are guaranteed all of the money that you are contractually oblige for. meaning we would pay BR 10m to go find another job, and if city interest is real, he would make even more. if we are worried financially bout how we can't sign players, then why would we just blow 10m like that? it would be better to literally spend years flushing 10m puonds 1 by 1 down the toilet, at least i'd get some enjoyment out of that. 

anyways, rant over, let me refocus. BR shouldn't be released for a variety of reasons, but importantly because: 

1. We would owe him 10m 
2. He has shown an ability to perform well with little resources (2nd place last year...SAS or not, we didn't have a big roster that was very good. we only used 14 players all season) 
3. We got to 2 Semi's this year 
4. He has 2 years of european experience, (2 europa league forrays, 1 CL) and I fully expect him to be able to perform much better. They do say third time's a charm. 
5. any coach coming in, unless mourinho who would undoubtedly make us a good team for the now but destroy our future, would need at least a couple years, maybe 3 to get on board 
6. Finally, while I think he should have done better tactically at times, he has shown multiple times his penchant to get it right. this is evidenced by our 13 match winning streak and our 13 match unbeaten run this year. The squad's average age without stevie, glenjo, brad jones and kolo is nearly spot on 23 years old, and if next year we show growth in the form of 4th place, he deserves to stay. i don't know managers that are touted by so many for their individual attention to detail, but so many players have come out and discussed this, former players and beyond. just look at interviews from gary monk and how highly he speaks of BR...and before you anyone is to go on about ""gary mnk wasn't that good blah blah blah"", he took a swansea city team (only in it's 4th year in the prem ever) to 8th place. 

anyways, hate me or love me, i think br should be given the chance to prove he can achieve top 4 for one more season. because if we change managers, we will guarantee another finish outside of the top 4, in my opinion.

&gt;__Bangor Abbey__ was established by [Saint Comgall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Comgall) in 558 in [Bangor, County Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangor,_County_Down), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) and was famous for its learning and austere rule.
