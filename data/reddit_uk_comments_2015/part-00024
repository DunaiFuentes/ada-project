null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"&gt; The simple reality is that Europeans are less likely than Brits to get Unemployment benefits. / Except that isn't the reality...

That *is* pretty much the reality.

From the article:

* Number of UK citizens in the rest of the EU claiming benefits: 29,025
* Number of UK citizens in the rest of the EU: 1.3 million
* Number of non-UK EU citizens in the UK claiming benefits: 64,830
* Number of non-UK EU citizens in the UK: 2.7 million

So chance of a UK citizen elsewhere in the EU claiming benefits is 29,025/1.3 million = 0.022

Chance of a non-UK EU citizen in the UK claiming benefits is 64,830/2.7 million = 0.024

The phrasing of the initial claim is a little vague, but if we tidy it up we get:

The simply reality is that ~~Europeans~~*non-UK EU citizens in the UK* are less likely than ~~Brits~~*UK citizens in the rest of the EU* to get unemployment benefits.

To know whether British citizens are more or less likely than Europeans to get unemployment benefits overall we'd need more data - on the number of people getting benefits across all of Europe etc.",null,0,null,1421692816,null,0,false,0,cnu1f5t,null,t3_2sxafw,null,t1_cnu1f5t,null,t1_cnts4m9,null,null,null,1424789992,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

As a spectator you're welcome to watch the games from behind the players, as long as they don't mind.

In between all the rooms there are two big rooms full of tables where people eat food, play board games, and drink. There's a big screen in one of them where tournament games are shown from all of the tournaments going on (SC2, LoL, CSGO, Dota). There'll be some consoles of some sort set up there you can play on.

For Dota, Friday is group stages, Saturday is elimination stages, the finals will be on Sunday.

The pub quiz is on Friday evening, which is when most of the LAN gathers in the central room.

There will be a small exhibitor area so if you have some spare cash then you can expect to shell some money out. There is a bar &amp; there will be a Pub Quiz on Friday which you are welcome to get involved in if you chose Friday to attend.

I never said that was also not a thing, but collapsing it to a single defintion in which a concept of bigotry is only ever rooted in power structures. Well its one of *the most rhetorically bankrupt* things in modern sociology. 

Bigotry exists outside of power structures. This utterly pedestrian fact should not be controversial. 

&gt;That doesn't mean that wealthy people like James Blunt are not sometimes hurt by class prejudice. Although in fairness to him this is all very ivory tower.

The quantifiable or not 'amount of hurt' incurred is irrelevant to a description of a situation in a natural framework. Again something sociology is getting very wrong at the moment.

                                Lovren    Skrtel   Sakho

                                         Sterling


This may seem a bit of a confusing lineup for some, but I reckon that the only way you can go toe to toe with Chelsea is if you match them physically. This is why I've gone for a slight change in formation to get Can in the midfield so he can stand on Matic's toes. In the league game Henderson marked Fabregas out of the game, so I'd give him that thankless task again. Playing Sterling up front gives Terry and Cahill something to worry about, and as we've seen before Can is more than capable of carrying the ball forward. If we start solid we can always make changes to influence the game, by changing the wingbacks or bringing Lovren off to change to the 3-4-3 formation depending on how the game goes. At the end of the day it's over two games so you're still in it if we stay solid and can't score, and it'll be good to get some practice of playing tight games seeing as we have a fair few competitions  left this season.

&gt;Indeed, if there had been an LGBT school in existence for Elizabeth Lowe, judging by the fact that her suicide was apparently caused by the sad fact that she was too scared to come out to her parents, it is unlikely they would have leafed through the prospectus.

There is currently almost nothing that can be done by a teen who is rejected by their parents because of their sexuality or gender identity. It also deals far more harm than any bully at school could. 14 year olds are simply completely incapable of defending themselves from their own parents, and from what I have seen, almost all suicides involving LGBT teens includes rejection by parents.

Schools have, in theory, the tools they need to deal with bullying. These tools are often only used when prompted by a parent to take action. Supportive parents can also deal with bullying directly even if the school refuses to do so, either by bringing it up with the bullies parent, complaining to people higher up than the school or, in worst case scenario, changing school. None of these things will happen if the parent rejects their own child though.

No, I don't have links to every one of these posts. As I said every post I have read that said something along those lines is why I have that opinion- I like Capaldi, I didn't just wake up and decide ""Hmm I bet lots of people don't like him!"". I've been on this thread for a few months and yes I've noticed people complaining about him- and, I disagree with 99.99% of their ""complaints"". Gender, age or status of fanship is unknown to me. I don't go into user history when someone posts that they dislike Capaldi as the Doctor. I just read the comment in threads and, after reading it several times, come to have it as part of my personal opinion that some people dislike him. And, from those comments, I draw the conclusion that some people don't like him because of the previously stated reasons- not handsome enough, not young enough, not whimsical, too grumpy, too mean and cold. I disagree with those complaints and think they are just too stuck on Tennant and/or Smith and their specific portrayals of the Doctor. I'm not going to sit and argue with anyone anymore over if this is or is not true or if these people are or are not ""real fans"" or what percentage of fans they are. I simply responded to the OPs original post with my opinion biased off what I have seen in comments on this very /r/DoctorWho reddit. I very much doubt that its considered ""very invested"" just to state hey this is what I've seen from being on this reddit for several months.

Having looked at the reasons a penis might be circumcised (Phimosis), it is clear that for males circumcision is an easy route to fix this but in women, it is a 'surgery' that I couldn't actually find any information about.

I suppose my next question would be then, is FGM an indiscriminant cutting of the clitoris? I ask because whilst there are medical benefits of circumcision, and it can be necessary, that fact does not mean it couldn't be considered mutilation, no?

If I have gangrene I might want my arm off, but cutting it off and claiming 'You might get gangrene' is another story altogether. I'd argue the first is obviously a surgery and the second an attack/mutilation. I suppose that's where my dislike for child circumcision comes from, things like HIV, HPV, UTIs, whilst nasty, are also preventable in other ways, so to cut the penis of a child under the pretext of prevention seems rash and wrong.

null,false,Queensappho,null,null,null,"Hiya guys, I just wanted to do a quick post about what the process is with pay escalations.


First though I've had a few people PM me who haven't spoken to their branch managers at all. It's a branch managers duty of care to his/her colleagues to sort all pay issues to the best of their ability. I've spoken to one very upset manager today because she had no idea that someone hadn't been paid correctly!


Ok so…


2 different scenarios:


1)	I haven't been paid at all
2)	I've been paid but part of it is missing


For scenario 1 you need to find out why you haven't been paid. Call people solutions and check whether the bank details they have are correct and if they are were any hours submitted for you. Assuming there were no hours submitted you will need to raise a pay escalation form for the missing hours that I can email out to you or **I'm happy to help you fill in over the phone and email it to you.** This form needs to be sent to your regions TPC. That not NOT people solutions. Check with your branch manager as to who your TPC is because each region will have a different one. Your TPC will then check it over and submit it directly to people solutions and they will generate the pay. If you email it directly to people solutions it'll get added to the backlog and result in further delays for you.


Scenario 2. Call people solutions and get a breakdown of what hours they have paid you on what exact weeks. The cpw week runs from a Sunday to a Saturday as well so you'll need info for week commencing the Sunday. The exact breakdown is very important so you know what specific weeks need escalating as the form is split into weekly chunks. This form again gets submitted to your TPC who will send it on to people solutions.


**If anybody at all needs my help with any of this please please PM me and I will do everything in my power to get you guys paid asap. Do not suffer in silence!**

Had decided to go teach English in Japan as a low-time-impact job (compared to self-employment), do some mad gigging for a year and apply for a US artist visa and move to New York. Then my now-partner asked me and another girl to join a band for a while, I was all ""yeah, be great for a few months before I go to Japan"", and then we got together, moved in together and started plotting escape together. I discovered some countries offer free uni education for EU (and even worldwide) students - check [bachelorsportal.eu](http://bachelorsportal.eu) and [mastersportal.eu](http://mastersportal.eu) if you're interested. And now we live in Finland! (MA in music psych/tech for me, music therapy for him). Next up, who knows... Italy, Spain, France...

I would defend NI in the ""don't slag off my family way"" if someone was being relentlessly negative, I do talk about the positive projects/orgs wherever I go and I'll be back doing work for a charity this spring, but I'm so glad to be away from Stormont muppetry, parochial attitudes and dampness!

You don't say what type of visa you applied for last time.  If it was just a regular visitor visa, then you would not have been permitted to look for work, so it would make sense that you were rejected.  If it was the proper visa, including a letter of invitation from the interviewing company, then I can't imagine why you would have been refused.  Having been there for some time before shouldn't be reason for refusal unless you overstayed.

The amount of time you spend in the UK should be commensurate with the amount of paid vacation you have from your job -- e.g. I wouldn't expect it to be more than 2 weeks.  You should consider bringing things like paystubs as evidence of your employment, and bank statements as evidence of your means.

Dealing with UKBA can be frustrating, but do bear in mind that many thousands of people do make fraudulent applications and/or overstay, so their concerns aren't entirely unfounded.  The UK authorities are, of course, your primary point of contact here, so to avoid disappointment you should talk to them as much as possible, and avoid booking travel until you have a visa (easier said than done, I know).  Bear in mind that there are also lawyers that specialise in advising on immigration matters.

I'm going to give you some unsolicited advice too.  If you've been in this relationship 4+ years, and are planning your life around these immigration issues, then you should seriously think about getting married.  The UK takes the (perhaps debatable, perhaps reasonable) view that if your relationship is serious enough to warrant you wanting to live in the UK, it's serious enough to put a ring on it.

null,false,acemerrill,null,null,null,"I get that complaint about Martha, but season 3 still has some of my favorite episodes and is sometimes my favorite season.  It was in large part because of Martha.  She was more than just smart, capable, and beautiful.  She was kind and she saw the best in people.  She always kept a level head and was extremely cool under pressure. I thought her character had a lot more depth than just having a crush on the Doctor.  She constantly added more emotion to her episodes by making connections to the other people.  Suddenly characters who would normally be fodder that we expected to lose carried weight.

In Smith and Jones, when everyone else was freaking the geak out, she was still making sense and looking for logical explanations.  She made the Doctor earn her trust, and he trusted her.  Her quick realization of what it meant that the Doctor had been used to assimilate and insistence on following through allowed the Plasmavore to be caught.

In Gridlock she befriended her kidnappers.  She actually listened to their story and made us want them to survive, and not just her.  On top of that, she didn't lose her cool, and came up with a way to keep them alive long enough for the Doctor to find her.

In 42, her quick connection with Riley and willingness to share an emotional moment with him lent gravity and a bit of reflection to an other-wise fast-paced episode.

In the Human Nature/Family of Blood she was the Doctor's protector.  She put up with being put in a position where she was belittled and ridiculed so that she could be there for the Doctor.  Once again, she connected with Jenny so that her getting turned into an alien puppet was more than just a plot point.

In the Utopia three-parter, she first makes an effort to get to know the most out of place person there.  She goes out of her way to learn more about Chantho.  She then spends the next two episode being brave and saving the world, even though her family is put in jeopardy.

Then when she is back in the Doctor's Daughter, she gets separated from the Doctor.  Instead of freaking out or just waiting for him, she makes the most of it.  She tends to the people who were just responsible for trying to kill her, and then manages to make an ally of someone who should see her as a sworn enemy.  She then comes to the same conclusion as the Doctor and, through her own will and strength (of course with some help from her new ally) gets to the same place as he did, almost at the same time.

Basically, I think Martha added a lot to Season 3. She was one of the few companions who was doing something with her life before she met the Doctor.  She learned a lot from him, but she didn't need him to become great, which makes her stand out for me. 

I acknowledge that some people may not like her. I like her because she is the only companion that I can really relate to.  I get that people don't feel the same way and could be annoyed by her crush on the Doctor.

For the most part, though, I find it understandable.  She is young and single.  The first time she meets the Doctor, he is a handsome, charismatic man who immediately recognizes her intelligence and merit (which, as a black woman in the medical profession, I am sure she appreciated).  He then kissed her and seemingly gave up his own life to save a bunch of strangers in a hospital.  I would find it unusual if she didn't develop a crush on him.  As others have mentioned, I think it shows tremendous strength of character for her to walk away from that.

Phew, that was lengthy.  I didn't mean to say that much.  I hope that doesn't seem defensive.  I get why people don't like her.  And, strangely enough, I can write just as much in defense of most of the companions.

Also, you are right that she probably could have been better written for, but I think that argument could be made of any of the characters.

 [**Intersectionality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Intersectionality__ (or __intersectionalism__) is the study of intersections between forms or systems of [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression), [domination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy) or [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination). An example is [black feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism), which argues that the experience of being a black female cannot be understood in terms of being black, and of being female, considered independently, but must include the interactions, which frequently reinforce each other. 

&gt;This [feminist sociological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_sociology) theory was first named by [Kimberlé Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Crenshaw) in 1989, though the concept can be traced back to the 19th century.   The theory suggests that—and seeks to examine how—various biological, social and cultural categories such as [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender), [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans\)), [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class), [ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability), [sexual orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [caste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste), and other axes of [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science\)) interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels, contributing to systematic [injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice) and [social inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality). Intersectionality holds that the classical conceptualizations of oppression within society, such as racism, [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism), [biphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphobia), [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia), [transphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia), and belief-based [bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry), do not act independently of one another. Instead, these forms of oppression interrelate, creating a system of oppression that reflects the ""intersection"" of multiple forms of discrimination. 

&gt;A standard textbook example of intersectionality theory is ""the view that women experience oppression in varying configurations and in varying degrees of intensity"".  A secondary textbook definition approaches intersection theory a bit more broadly as ""the interplay of race, class, and gender, often resulting in multiple dimensions of disadvantage"".  Cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society. Examples of this include race, gender, class, ability, and [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity). 

&gt;Intersectionality is an important paradigm for sociology and [cultural studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies), but difficulties arise due to the many complexities involved in making ""multidimensional conceptualizations""  that explain the way in which socially constructed categories of differentiation interact to create a social hierarchy. For example, intersectionality holds that knowing a woman lives in a sexist society is insufficient information to describe her experience; instead, it is also necessary to know her race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, etc., as well as society's attitude toward each of these in order to fully understand her position within society.

&gt;The theory of intersectionality also suggests that discrete forms and expressions of oppression are shaped by one another. Thus, in order to fully understand the [racialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization) of oppressed groups, one must investigate the ways in which racializing structures, social processes, and [social representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_representation) (or ideas purporting to represent groups and group members in society) are shaped by gender, class, sexuality, etc.  While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women within society, today sociologists strive to apply it to all people and to many different intersections of group membership [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

It is legally protected free-speech.  What I'm questioning is whether it goes against the *spirit* of the principles of free speech.  I think it does.

Let's say I didn't like a book discussing feminism and I got a group of my mates together to protest a chain of book shops to remove the book, with the intent that they would withdraw the book and that the publisher would drop the author.  We would have the legal right to do so, but are our aims really in accord with free speech principles?  I don't think so.  Why?  Because, ultimately, our goal is to shut down speech we don't like.

I know it seems glorious and wonderful when it's a campaign to shut down speech you object to. But think what happens when the shoe is on the other foot - and it will be one day.  Some day the mob will come protesting literature, or movies, or opinion which you agree with.

And I think there's a difference between criticism and policing others' speech.  I have *no* problem with anyone decrying page 3 as an insult to women.   But, I get off the train at the point where people start calling for a newspaper, that they don't even read!, to censor themselves so as not to cause offense.

And I’m convinced that we won’t be Great Britain if we waste great British talent in the arts. You seem to think talent will always out. My fear is that someone like Stanley Baker, the son of a disabled miner in the Rhondda, who rose to be one of Britain’s greatest film actors (Zulu), would have found it even harder to make it today.

There are two ways of reading that anecdote. 1) Bryant fears that without a levelling of opportunity we will miss out on films like Zulu, and 2) Bryant fears that, regardless of what is produced at the end, poor people are disbarred from pursuing the arts as a career.

Whether great art is more likely to come from particular demographics is a hell of a question. There's certainly an argument that hardship produces the best art, but another argument that training (or at least enough leisure time to practice) produces the best art. Your mileage may vary, anyhow. But I doubt Bryant has taken the time to answer it even to himself, so I don't see why he would bring up such a point.

As for his second point, poor people have more access to the arts, both as spectators and producers, than ever before. If Baker had been born today his chances of acting on stage or in front of a camera would be much higher than they were in his era. Whether he would have had a better chance of making a living out of acting is another question, but one that poses difficulties even for Bryant. Remove the barriers to entry and you expand the pool of available labour. The rest is supply and demand.

I'm near rambling at this stage, but I have a final point. Being born into a rich family is unfair. You have no control over it, and you benefit through no endeavour of your own. But being born talented is not much different. Most at the top of their industry will have had a significant genetic advantage be it in terms of attitude or disposition, or likely a combination of both. Bryant must have a generous view of hard work if he thinks discrimination on the basis of talent is much fairer than discrimination on the basis of wealth.",null,0,null,1421700548,null,0,false,0,cnu6bs4,null,t3_2sxigz,null,t1_cnu6bs4,null,t1_cnttm9t,null,null,null,1424518438,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The entire movement of privilege, intersectionality and identity politics are heavily flawed ideas based around complaining and victimisation over organisation and actually doing things.

Those who have some of the cushiest, easiest lives in the entire world, need a way to complain and ask for more while being white. But they're a woman so they don't have **male privilege**.

What is the message? We can't complain about EU migration while we have Tel and his arsehole mates on the Costa Del Sol? 

I don't buy that. 

Emigration to the UK from extremely poor eastern European countries is bad for everybody. Free movement has massive, tangible benefits however it should be between relatively similar developed economies.

The EU has expanded eastwards in a political cold war absorbing Warsaw pact countries without heed to concerns about the damage free movement between significantly different economies does.

Something a little less extreme than what we have now might see more freedom for richer EU companies to invest in poorer EU countries and some freedom of movement between similar economies without causing massive amounts of young people to leave some countries.

Just for reference, that's about $10,000 more than the median family income in the USA and those families have to also pay large sums for health insurance.

Other things too, the wording is very vague as to whether it includes benefits or not. I'm guessing not as that would make their press release even more 'shocking'. A family of 4 with one parent employed and earning £16,000 will receive approx. £20,000 worth of benefit (£8K in cash, the rest on rent and council tax).

You can't get a realistic figure on the 'minimum' needed to play a part in society from round table interviews because people will massively over-estimate what's needed when in a group; fear of embarrassment pushes up what people say they spend and keeps them from saying things they do to save money. When you've lots of people all saying what they 'need' to leave an active life, suddenly the 'average' family has a huge number of hobbies.  

Things like having a 'modest' holiday are agreed upon because they're easy things that everyone can agree on to cut spending on whilst not feeling pressured or guilty about (and it makes for good 'proof' in the press release that they are being realistically frugal).

Do people really believe that 40% of people are so poor they can't function in society? Excluding the possibility that a large portion of these families are completely locked up in their house, not letting their kids go to school, this simply isn't happening.

That may be so but I don't think it's at all clear that they are intending to put the smoking ban to a vote. Their policy from their website says:

&gt;UKIP will amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open smoking rooms properly ventilated and separated from non-smoking areas.   

Honestly I haven't heard any implication at all that any of their major policies other than the EU question will be put to a vote. If all of their policies were put up to a vote I would be less worried about UKIPs particular brand of hatred-fuelling scapegoating. I think if the general public had to sit down and adopt each UKIP policy 1 by 1 I think only maybe 5 or 10 would be adopted and no more. UKIP supporters don't agree with what UKIP say 100% of the time - they agree on immigration and the EU and everything else has failed to convince many people. 

Take UKIPs climate change denial for example. 57% of the public believe humans are causing climate change so their entire environmental policy would have to be binned. Certainly their policy to legalise handguns would be scrapped too. I think people wouldn't be too pleased with them reducing the licence fee (and therefore the BBC) in size. 

Even having said all that their policies change every 6 months so it's impossible to keep track of. They used to be in favour of privatising the NHS, repatriating immigrants and a flat tax to lower tax for the rich and raise it for the poor. Now they have dumped all those things and rail against the bedroom tax. They wanted to cut 2 million public sector jobs and use the money to buy 3 new aircraft carriers (on top of the 2 we already were building) - now they don't mention these things. Oh yeah, and they wanted to ban Al Gore's film from schools because I guess the free exchange of ideas is bad when they don't tie in with The Party's ideology. 

Anyway my point is that I don't think the direct democracy idea is really UKIP policy (except to make them look uber-democratic on the EU issue). Even if it was it's kind of impossible to tell what UKIP's smaller policies are anyway that I can't believe even UKIP supporters know what they are.

He sets himself, as a Muslim, against the 'kuffar', his opponents. He claims the absolute superiority of Islam as the framework for social life among Muslims, and to enforce its norms on the rest of society. He decries liberalism, and points out its incompatibility with his religion. Islam can be compatible with British values, but his interpretation cannot. This is very clear.

If I was in a business that hired Clifford Chance and was sent this guy, I would be disgusted. A racially insensitive joke in poor taste on her personal twitter account was enough to get [Justine Sacco fired](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/pr-exec-fired-racist-tweet-aids-africa-apology) from her job as a P.R. executive. Other employees at Clifford Chance should not have to work with Aysh Chaudhry, and like you, I'm disappointed that they have not yet taken any action.

&gt; I'm perfectly aware that some of the most dangerous extremists we have produced are often highly educated, with a proclivity toward engineering.

Yes I've noticed the apparent preponderance of engineering too; I've always put it down to a mental need for clarity and certainty.

Whether they intend to put it to a vote or not is not the point - if they implement their citizens' initiative promise, the population at large can precipitate a vote, binding the Government.

They would go on as a normal government in Parliament, but if something controversial like amending the smoking ban (or something more serious like scrapping the Human Rights Act) comes up, people can organize themselves a petition and force the Government to have a referendum, by law.

&gt;– UKIP will introduce the Citizens’ Initiative to allow the public to initiate national referendums on issues of major public interest.

The only things there couldn't be a vote on, would be the things they do before the citizens' initiative law is brought in. But even then, on most issues there could be one post-hoc.

I also think you are confusing things that members said, often was reported as if it were party policy - but never actually was.

Maybe you don't *believe* they'd fulfill this promise - that's a separate issue and the whole thing is hypothetical anyway. My point is just that the following argument,

&gt;He has however suggested that non-smokers be 'free' to inhale carcinogens if they want to visit a pub despite the fact that 78% of adults in 2012 said they supported the smoking ban.

1) To attack enemy forces tactically in the field within your own country. This gives no justification for retaliation.
2) To attack a navy in open water.
3) As a warning shot over enemy territory to show the serious threat.
4) To commit a second holocaust by targeting population centres, the ultimate fate of a nuclear exchange.
5) As an EMP device to knock out a country's electrical grid without significant casualties.

This also doesn't take into consideration the fact that the nuclear submarines we actually use have torpedo tubes too. In any serious invasion of Britain, they're going to have to deal with nukes and powerful submarines too.

Without nuclear weapons, our country would have some difficulty defending itself. As per usual our only real defence would be that beloved English Channel of ours.

Bear in mind the scenario I talk of is the threat of invasion of mainland Britain. Nuclear weapons do nothing to protect us in a war that is outside our shores.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Let's say I didn't like a book discussing feminism and I got a group of my mates together to protest a chain of book shops to remove the book, with the intent that they would withdraw the book and that the publisher would drop the author. We would have the legal right to do so, but are our aims really in accord with free speech principles? I don't think so. Why? Because, ultimately, our goal is to shut down speech we don't like.

It's a difficult one. The problem I have is that you're also using your right to free speech and protest. I can see how one form of free speech can be seen as violating someone else's right but ultimately it doesn't. Being denied a platform, by the publishers in this case, is not a violation of free speech. You're not entitled to have your speech heard and the book shop as well as the publisher are free to make commercial decisions that impact upon them.

It is a shitty thing to do however and it is a technique that is increasingly being used by student groups to deny debate platforms to views they don't like. I strongly disagree with that and I would join you in a counter-protest in that case. Although my passion would vary depending on the case probably. 

&gt; I know it seems glorious and wonderful when it's a campaign to shut down speech you object to. But think what happens when the shoe is on the other foot - and it will be one day. Some day the mob will come protesting literature, or movies, or opinion which you agree with.

I am aware of the ramifications and I don't really care about Page 3 either. 

Again though I don't see what can be done to stop them without violating their right to free speech as well. 

The only way to make this work is to say that violence and the arm of the law shouldn't be used. After that then it's a free for all. People can write what they want, say what they want and protest what they want within reason (i.e you can't call for violence or shout fire in a theatre).

&gt; And I think there's a difference between criticism and policing others' speech. I have no problem with anyone decrying page 3 as an insult to women. But, I get off the train at the point where people start calling for a newspaper, that they don't even read!, to censor themselves so as not to cause offense.

Yes but the difference here is if you think they should be stopped be law and thus their free speech rights have been prevented (calling for boycotts isn't illegal) or you just want to counter-protest.

Even if it is a bit of a con trick because they all end up taking the same tests at the end - home schooling, tutoring and classroom teaching are all methods you can already choose between in the UK, it's just that no one knows that, and so every year a new batch of kids gets packed off to school because there is no alternative, and they hate it, and they lash out.

In such a hostile environment, as others have said, anything that marks a kid out as different will be used as a weapon against them. Normalising is sadly unrealistic simply because there aren't enough non-straight people. Even if everyone was out you'd still be dealing with a minority group factor to the tune of 1 in 10 or so.

Beware though that the competition for pretty much *any* job is fierce, particularly in the bars and restaurants, so you may need to take anything you can get. If you have some qualifications that mean you could look at something a little more specialised then you might have more luck.

For the third time I will point out that I full well understand that it's not a violation of your *legal* right to free speech.  But denying others a platform *is* against the principles of free speech.  I said this before, but the reason it goes against free speech principles is because it's an attempt to shut down others'  speech.  

And no, I *don't* want the law to intervene at any stage!  And for the fourth time (!), of course people have the right to protest who they want.  For that matter, I think people should also have the right to build a big bonfire of all books by Jewish authors if they so choose, but forgive me if I don't think it's a particularly good or noble thing to do.  

Here's a good (short) essay which outlines these arguments much better than my attempts.

Suicidal. Nuclear weapons are *not* things that the UK could cope with having detonated on our territory- particularly not at the yields we presently field. We're too densely populated- it's not worth rendering most of the South-East uninhabitable to stop a few tank columns. 

If things get to the point of having to deploy nuclear weapons on British soil, we've already lost the war. 

&gt;To attack a navy in open water

Unnecessary. The U.S. Navy's the strongest in the world by a staggering margin, and they're integrated into NATO's military structure. Combined with the French and British navies, NATO's got the greatest naval force in the world. Dropping nuclear missiles on dated Russian battleships would be a needless escalation. 

There's absolutely no conceivable case in which we would use one of our nuclear weapons at sea in defence of the UK, simply because *it would never get to that point*. 

&gt;As a warning shot over enemy territory to show the serious threat.

If you're *firing ICBMs over enemy territory*, you've gone far beyond the ""threat"" stage. It'll get picked up by the scanning systems set up for that purpose, the deterrence game will be played out as planned, their missiles will start flying, and then all of a sudden it's gone a bit Threads. 

Nuclear Weapons *are not used like that*. 

&gt;To commit a second holocaust by targeting population centres, the ultimate fate of a nuclear exchange

This isn't an argument in favour of retaining a nuclear arsenal. 

&gt;As an EMP device to knock out a country's electrical grid without significant casualties.

If they have nuclear weapons as well, they'll do the same to us in retaliation. It's a needless escalation.

* Repairs. Have a plumber look over the place - are things going to start leaking.
* Repairs. Have a... you get the picture :-)
* Energy Efficiency Improvements.  Do you need cavity wall insulation? Loft insulation? Buying energy saving light-bulbs?  They'll save money in the long run, but are a costly short term expense.
* Change the locks.  Easy enough to do yourself if your handy with a screwdriver - but £££ if you get a professional to do it.
* Moving. Whether you're hiring a van or getting the professionals in, check costs and make sure everything is insured.
* Cleaning. Get the place cleaned before you move in.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; For the third time I will point out that I full well understand that it's not a violation of your legal right to free speech. But denying others a platform is against the principles of free speech. I said this before, but the reason it goes against free speech principles is because it's an attempt to shut down others' speech.

You don't need to keep repeating that you understand it's violation of your legal right. However I am asking what you what you can do about it. 

&gt; And no, I don't want the law to intervene at any stage! And for the fourth time (!), of course people have the right to protest who they want. For that matter, I think people should also have the right to build a big bonfire of all books by Jewish authors if they so choose, but forgive me if I don't think it's a particularly good or noble thing to do

Then we don't really disagree and I have already addressed this when I said: *People can write what they want, say what they want and protest what they want within reason (i.e you can't call for violence or shout fire in a theatre).* 

The Sun are entitled to print Page 3, the Page 3 campaigners are entitled to object to what they're printing, you are entitled to objected to their objection as you think it's a violation of the principle of free speech. The debate can go on forever and probably will but that's how it should be. It's up to society to decide these things and arguing about it is healthy.

Occupy burned out for a lot of reasons, but the choice of language there speaks volumes. It wasn't a case of noble, competent ""white guys"" trying to bring about order that killed it- it was the complete lack of any *objective*. That gave the movement too broad a base to pull together- how do you accommodate an organisation comprised of anarchists, Palestinian Solidarity activists, right-Libertarians, radfems, Trots and Maoists? It was doomed from the get-go- all it ever really was was a hollow expression of vague, directionless anger. 

The problem was structural. Nothing could have come of the movement. 

&gt;Those who have some of the cushiest, easiest lives in the entire world, need a way to complain and ask for more while being white.

This really isn't what this kind of analysis is about- you've not fully understood it. 

One can be a beneficiary of privileged status *and understand the nature of that, and how it impacts upon others*. It's a legitimate avenue of academic inquiry. 

Moreover, one in a position with ""nothing to complain about"" can still be in a position to *understand why they're well off*, and *how other people's privilege affects them in different ways*.

&gt;But they're a woman so they don't have male privilege. Got to find some way to make yourself seem like a victim while the men die in Iraq and Afghan eh?

Male privilege is a thing, with legitimate consequences. Female privilege is also a thing, with legitimate *different* consequences. 

It's hardly an excuse to whinge- it's a well-established area of academic inquiry.

&gt;It all reeks so much of tall poppy syndrome. 

It really doesn't, outside the radfem-arch-castratrixes of reactionary campfire stories. 

It's a way of trying to conceptualise why our society's structured the way it is, and understand the structural injustices inherent therein. *Understanding* that a black gay kid in an orphanage will have a significantly higher mountain to climb to get by in life than a boy born into the aristocracy and packaged off to Charterhouse will have to surmount to do the same isn't ""tall poppy syndrome""- it's being able to *think*.

There's been several times this season LFC have connected and put in solid periods of quality football. It's a two-leg cup game, everyone loves a cup game, and some players rise to it. For me Hazard+Fabregas+Costa is too much for any defence in their current form and hope for a injury free, 4 trophy haul this season. I might be biased of course but a LFC win would put out a statement.

For Liverpool FC it feels both Cups mean something more this season because its SteveG's last season and because there is still some reconstructing going on within the team. Winning these trophies makes LFC more attractive and relevant for the type of talent you'd hope to attract which I think we can all agree on.

Henderson+Gerrard+Lallana in full swing would be massive animal to try and tame and there's been glimpses of that this season. I think Brendan is quality and anyone calling for his removal needs their heads examined. The guy who suggested signing Balotelli also could use with a head examination.

It might well be OK for you as long as you are not raw. Definitely patch test or avoid the most sensitive areas. And DO NOT be tempted to swipe your cotton pad over the same area multiple times, you concentrate the acid and risk a burn. Yes I know that from being a careless idiot!

Also if you do have sensitive skin sometimes your skin can sting a little much later on when it gets wet (shower/ tears/ any part of your face routine). That is totally normal, it means some of the acid is sitting in your skin and is being reactivated. That is just a warning not to do acids again too soon. If it is uncomfortable use occlusives instead of water based products (unfragranced mineral oil, olive squalane, Aquaphor, rosehip seed oil, anything you know is not clogging for you).

I mean everyone knows how Pulis' teams play but that was a toothless performance even still. I'll start with my usual player description thing and go through the team.

Joel didn't have much to do but he made a good save when their man was called offside anyway, yup that's pretty much it for him. I must say though I do feel confident with him in goal especially compared to Howard and I suppose in positives I suppose a clean sheet isn't a bad thing for him. 

Stones seems like the only competent centre half at the club. I mean Jags didn't do much wrong tonight but he didn't do anything amazing or even that well. He's not a champions league pushing defender but this season we're not a champions league pushing team. Stones however looks so confident on and off the ball. 

Baines and Coleman weren't exactly great today either but again didn't do that badly but we'll talk about Baines a bit later on.

Besic was easily MOTM again today and I would like anybody to please give me an explaination why he was the one to be taken off today when he was depressingly enough one of our best attacking threats all match. Barry wasn't too bad today either he was actually quite good with his standards this season too.

Barkely needs a good time on the sidelines I think. He's not a ""young prospect"" anymore, he's a first team player and there's no excuse for him making mistakes or anything like that in games anymore especially when you take into account that Stones and Besic are younger and the same age as him. He's not been bad and perhaps it's our own fault for hyping him too much but he's not been great as of late. 

Naisy wasn't great today either but yet he's not an out and out winger either so we can't be too harsh on him for that. He does however need to improve his passing a bit like he was before in the season where he was a very good passer. 

Rom again can't be faulted too much because honestly he got fuck all all day and anything he did get he largely had to make it himself. He was lucky for our penalty though because it was bad enough control for him.

Now the big one! Mirallas what the fuck are you playing at buddy? Baines is the penalty taker at the club and if you're too selfish to understand that then honestly you've no place here if you can't respect what the manager chooses for set pieces. Baines should've obviously pulled rank but it's not his fault to do that. I can honestly now see Kev even being sold this month after a disgrace like this. It's basically been an open secret he's leaving next year anyway with the way he's been talking in the press lately but he is playing for a move lately and if you don't think that I'm sorry but you're very naive. Obviously I wouldn't want him gone but selfishness is not welcome at the club and if we can find an adequate replacement I'd gladly see the back of him because honestly this has annoyed me so much! I hope he does get a fine for this at the very least but this is a huge disrespect to Roberto, Baines and the club.",null,0,null,1421705611,null,0,false,0,cnu9mmf,null,t3_2szbg0,null,t1_cnu9mmf,null,t3_2szbg0,null,null,null,1424516898,null,4,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,4,null

What you have witnesses here is the downside of possession based style. If you don't have a strong creative player then your possession is worthless since you will never make good scoring opportunities.

Evertons best creative player so far has been Mirallas the problem with him is that he is not consistent and his injury problem of late has hindered him in playing the full 90 minutes. 

Another guy is of course Barkley but ever since that game where he played alongside Besic he hasn't contributed as much creativity up front. 

Besic has the potential to be an engine player aka roaming playmaker but for that he needs time to get a better communication with the players. You saw some misunderstandings between him and Naismith and also between him and Baines. That will eventually be improved but right now I feel Everton lacks a creative player who can always deliver. 

I didn't watch any Everton games last year sadly so I don't know how you guys played but right now I get a lot of deja-vu from a transitioning Bayern Munich side during the days of the van Gaal reign.

If you're buying on your own, even with the tenant, I think you're buying too much house. Its great that you want to pay off the mortgage quickly, but just over 50% of your take home salary on the mortgage for your first home is not a good idea. It leaves very little wriggle room in your budget. Also, £140 per month left over for savings, emergencies, holidays, etc is not enough. As a very rough guide, most people should be saving at least 15% of their take home salary for the future, and the hardcore personal finance nerds out there will aim for 30% plus. With your £140pcm, a few bad months could see you in serious trouble.


My advice is to go for a cheaper house. Probably around the £130k to £180k range for someone with your income. Get a monthly mortgage that's around 15-20% of your take home salary, try it out for a few months, then if you're comfortable with your outgoings, slowly increase the monthly payment. Not only will you be getting yourself into less debt, but with a bigger initial deposit relative to the cost of the house you should be able to get a better interest rate than 4.5% (which is pretty high in these days of ultra-low mortgage rates). Buying a house is a big deal, and there will always be unexpected expenses that hit you right in the face. You need to have the free cash flow to be able to deal with them.


You might have your heart set on a bigger house, but as cheesy as it sounds, remember that a house is just a building with 4 walls and a roof. A home is what you make of it.

Irrespective of what has actually happened with the penalty (and lets be fair, at this point it's conjecture, and it will probably remain so forever with Roberto's now customary positivity/spin) the fact that absolutely nobody tells Mirallas how it is is indicative of the lack of leadership that really does tend to pervade our squad these days and I do feel we suffer for our lack of that (amongst other things, obviously).

On Mirallas though, I love him. I always have, for the pearlers he seems able to stick in at will from 25 yards, for that mauling at Anfield where he tried to drag the team back into anything resembling respectability, but every time there are stories of dressing room difficulties (and I'm sure we've all heard them) Mirallas is usually a name involved.

The downsides? 

Has Baines taken a good free kick or corner since he broke his toe last year? 

Barkley has no confidence. We need him if Mirallas is leaving. 

We're not scoring. The worrying thing is that because of the lack of confidence, nobody is taking shots from range either. I'm not a fan of losing patience on the edge of the area, but you have to switch things up to avoid becoming predictable.     

That was a dick move by Mirallas, but without him we struggle for creativity. Martinez was right to sub him off, though. Hopefully it's as simple as club policy for disobeying orders rather than a falling out.

Finally, does anyone else think we need a slightly stronger captain?
I like Jagielka a lot, but I think his leadership skills (at least on the pitch - I imagine he's great off it) leave a lot to be desired. Everyone knows Baines isn't the most confrontational person in the world, and a strong captain would have put a stop to that penalty bollocks straight away.

Fair plé. I ask because it *might be* asking the impossible. It's not like saying 'consider vegetarianism' to a meat eater, or 'consider atheism' to a theist.  Those *are* big ideas: but language is bigger.  Language is the mechanism by which those ideas; *all* ideas; are formed.  
It's impossible to really consider an Irish point of view, in English. But if you're still game please consider this:    

Biologically we're just primates.  We eat, poop, have sex, sleep and soon die. Some of us have blue eyes, some have green; There's lots of variety in skin and hair colour: but the genetic differences are not profound. We all live short lives within the same spectrum of emotions. Our bodies are functionally the same.  Our brains are the same. Our minds are different, thanks to language; and it's a precious difference.  With languages we can build complex thoughts, extend our awareness into the past, into the future and into each other.  We can bake, fight Shaolin Style, make TETЯIS, brew whuisce. Cinema, Literature, Medicine, Philosophy- are all realized, in the mind, via language.
    
now:    
If you're still with me, we're kind of getting to the limit of what can be understood of one language from outside of it.     
(An bhfuil Gaeilge agat?)        
If you identify as Irish and honestly didn't understand the question; you are by far in the minority.  Even then, often that minority will wistfully say 'Oh I wish I could speak it...'. Speaking it is good, and healthy, and culturally nice: But we should aspire to *think* it.  Because that's what matters. Plenty of people can reason in English, or French, or Chinese.  Extinguishing or allowing to be extinguished the Gaelic mind would diminish all of humanity. It would be a Critical Érror which would *literally* reduce the wonder in the universe.

This leaves us with 2 options:

1- Play Naismith out of position as a winger.  This means that Barkley doesn't have an solid winger on that side and instead has a player to gets sucked to the middle which ends up just eating up space for Barkley to create.

In summary, it is **illegal** to carry any object for the exclusive purpose of using it offensively against someone. Self-defence would only be a justifiable excuse for offences of wounding, assault, GBH, etc. Legally, you cannot carry anything ""any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use"". 

This covers any offensive weapon (""those made for causing injury to the person i.e. offensive per se""), any adapted object made for causing injury, or ""those not so made or adapted, but carried with the intention of causing injury to the person"".

With any object deemed ""offensive per se"" (e.g. a taser, pepper spray, knuckledusters, whatever), ""the prosecution does not have to prove that the defendant had the weapon with him for the purpose of inflicting injury: if the jury are sure that the weapon is offensive per se, the defendant will only be acquitted if he establishes lawful authority or reasonable excuse."" If you carry an object whose sole purpose is for causing injury, you are guilty of carrying an offensive weapon. 

In *R v Stones* [1989] the doctrine was established that simple possession of an offensive weapon was enough to be guilty, even despite mitigating circumstances unrelated to another crime. 

tl;dr Don't carry any weapon or object solely intended to cause injury to someone, even in self-defence, unless you want to be convicted. Remember that carrying weapons you don't know how to use and trying to use them in a fight is a good way to injure yourself.

This was further accentuated in the period after this - in spite of the great technological and academic contributions of Manchester and Leeds, our heavy industry really missed out on diversifying or adapting to the new economy. There are many factors in this obviously, but just look how much the Midlands grew comparatively from the 1930s to the late 1950s through the manufacture of consumer goods (of terrible cars and vacuum cleaners).

The Thatcher Era took this to greater extremes and affected it more deeply, but there were antecedents.

It's understandable that she had a crush on the Doctor, and she deserves credit as  the only companion to realize the crush was hopeless and move on with her life, but even so, the crush hurt the arc.

I think part of the problem wasn't Martha herself, but the Doctor pining over Rose.  It really hurt the dynamic between the two of them.  Martha was a good character, and obviously the Doctor's a good character, but the whole ""unrequited love"" thing wasn't very interesting, and was kind of the focus of their arc (not individual episodes, but their character development over the course of the season).

A lot of the things he's done wrong this season he did very well last season (subs for example). Like the rest of the team, he has it in him. 

His biggest flaw is what makes him so likeable - he has too much faith in his players. I'm pretty sure he thinks even Alcaraz is world class. Because of that, the entirely predictable time bomb that is Distin and the permanently injured Alcaraz didn't get replaced in the summer.  

Our defence hasn't been that different from last year but instead of individual heroics we've have individual errors from Tim ""world class"" Howard, Jagielka (could have been foreseen off the back of a bad world cup), Distin, Alcaraz, and Barry. 

That all sounded a bit scathing of our defensive players. It wasn't meant to be, but the problem is that there's no real back-up for the first names in our defence when things go as wrong as they have. Stones has been great, but he's one very inexperienced man who promptly got injured at the worst possible moment. The team is shot of confidence and we have no way of restoring it because we have no unaffected players to rotate into the squad to kickstart a good run of form. 

Other than that, we might want to look at a creative attacking player or another fast winger. Our attack is actually pretty good despite today, the players just need a bit more confidence so they can start taking some risks again. But then we need a defence that can handle it when it goes wrong.

Finally, a new captain as much as it pains me to say. I think Jagielka gets down on himself. It's nice that he accepts responsibility but he needs to shoulder it rather than let it crush him.

I think Howard is the better keeper but his form is appalling. 

** I would rotate Barkley and Naismith, with Naismith being preferred. Hopefully it will kick Barkley up the arse and give him something to prove.

*** I dunno. We need a new winger. Oviedo is more solid but Pienaar and McGeady are capable of greater feats of random awesome.

The 2011/12 season was a great time too, especially in the fall and winter when Spurs were up as high as second place and the team was probably the most talented in club history since the Hoddle years. The starting XI — Friedel, BAE, Dawson, King, Corluka, Modric, Parker, Bale, Lennon, vdV, Adebayor — looked like a legitimate dark horse for the PL title. (Liverpool last year finished second with less talent imo) But that season also included Redknapp flirting with the England job, the 5-2 Arsenal loss after being 2-0 up, the 1-1 draw against Villa that bumped us out of third place to fourth, and Chelsea's CL win that knocked us out of next year's CL. It was a wild emotional rollercoaster that ended very bittersweet.

The AVB era was fun mainly because of Bale and how fast he was growing in front of our eyes. But the offense without Bale was anemic. The creativity that Modric and vdV brought to the club was stripped after they departed to Real Madrid and Hamburg respectively. The defense was stout and Spurs were garnering points at a club record pace, but it lacked that *magic* that made me want to wake up at 5 am regularly to watch the games. 

Last season was a long comedy show, but I enjoyed watching the young'uns like Bentaleb and Kane get their shots in the first team.

Which brings me to this season under Pochettino. My preseason expectation was top 8, so I'm obviously impressed so far. But what I really love seeing are the rise of young players — Bentaleb, Mason, Kane, Eriksen, Townsend, Dier, Davies, and Rose — buying into the manager's system and playing with confidence. They lack the flair and polish compared to the 2010/11 or 2011/12 squads, but their potential ceiling and their contagious eagerness is a different kind of enjoyment that gets me up to tune in. 

As a Californian, I started following Spurs eight years ago largely because they had all these young promising British talents like Jenas, Lennon, teenage Bale, Huddlestone, and Bent. While some people here just want results and wins, I find profound enjoyment in watching these domestic talents grow every weekend. That's what separated Spurs from the rest when I was searching for an EPL team to follow, and I for one am very glad to see that the club is going back to these roots. And by the looks of it, it seems like the Academy will be fertile ground for more talent in the coming years.

One of my best memories has got to be going to watch Southampton v Bayern, I think it was my first time seeing them and at only £1 for a kids ticket. It was a mid-season friendly, which is a bit weird but it was fucking awesome.

We drew 1-1, I can't remember who scored for us (Ormerod?) but Ballack got the equaliser for Bayern. Beattie almost cracked the crossbar from around 35 yards too in the last few minutes. I was sat at the other end basically in line with him and the goal so I got an amazing view on the dip on the shot. The sound it made when it hit the woodwork was incredible.

Niemi and Anders Svensson (who was my favourite at the time) were playing for sure. Bayern had Ballack, Hargreaves and I think Schweinsteiger was there too. I found out later it was Benali's last appearance for us but he was a little bit before my time so I didn't really appreciate the significance of the moment, I remember him getting a big reception when he came on though.

Ditching an (obviously paid) party for a reason other than illness/emergency is shitty.

Getting so angry about it that you send an invoice is just shitty.

At most, I would have sent a polite note: *""we were disappointed not to see Timmy at Johnny's party, we had already bought a ticket for him so next time if you can give us a little more notice, we can pass it to another child.""* But I probably wouldn't even bother doing this, over a few quid.

I actually had a friend 100% forget a birthday trip I invited her kid to, she was mortified when I rang to see if she was stuck in traffic or something. She even offered to pay for the unused ticket but I would never have accepted, it's just something you write off in the name of friendship.  The money didn't bother me, I was sad that they couldn't make it.

The best advice is to learn from this, and:

1. Be clear about RSVPs and mentioned that you need to ""buy ticket numbers""

2.  Send a reminder invite a few days before

3.  If there's a no show, make a polite inquiry, and if a shitty reason is given, accept with grace and don't invite the child to (expensive) events in future",null,0,null,1421711769,null,0,false,0,cnuda7r,null,t3_2sx4i4,null,t1_cnuda7r,null,t1_cntqpy2,null,null,null,1424515136,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Both of these cups have diminished a bit in importance because they don't generate a ton in prize money compared to getting into the Champions League. I'm sticking my neck out here, but I'd imagine most people would take 4th in the League and no trophies over winning both FA/League Cup and coming in 8th.

Modern Gallifreyan looks almost Arabic in written form, but no idea about how it sounds. I assume circular Gallifreyan would sound the same as this, except that it is an alternative way to write it. Probably because, well, it looks more alien to the viewers. 

While Old and Modern Gallifreyan looks very different, I think it would sound at least somewhat similar. So to those who do not understand, it would have a sort of a musical quality to it.

Here are the [ingredients](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5c2862856.html) of the melting gel! I double checked it with an image of the packaging, so I think it's right. Parfum is right bang in the middle of the ingredient list and another fragrance again at the end which is a bit.. weird. 

If you're keen on starting again and think it's your hygiene I'd start with looking at your cleanser. Oil Cleansers have no pH (as they aren't water based). In our cleanser mega thread there are some oil cleanser favourites [*here*](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2icnkb/the_cleanser_reviews/cl0xbkv). Picking an oil cleanser comes down to preference really. How liquidy do you want it, what oils does your skin like and what additional ingredients bother you? My skin is boring, likes mineral oil and isn't bothered by fragrance, so the L'Oreal one is perfect for me. Others like a balm that turns into an oil. Total preference thing!

Any other cleanser the important thing is, ""Is this pH 5.5 or not?"" anything else is again down to preference or how your skin reacts. pH 5.5 because that's the pH of healthy skin! Anything too high is likely to cause further damage. Most companies don't tell you the pH, but the ones I know that are:

* Eucerin (Dermopurifyer is for oily/acne skin, but I think most of their cleansers are)

* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel 

* Sebamed (that's their whole thing)

I know there are others, but I haven't tested them.

Hope this helps?

* ~10% is negligible to me in terms of adding it on, but it's a nice bonus to minimum wage staff.
* 20%+ is a genuine thankyou for going out of your way to make this nice.
* A tip goes in cash, as you're leaving the table. Don't sit there with the tip on the tray. It makes it awkward for the staff. Have you just not picked your change up yet, do they say thankyou etc.
* Don't tip because you want someone to thank you for it, you are thanking them. Keep it discreet.
* A service charge works well for large tables (&gt;4 people in my opinion) as it's rare you'll get a real tip from each member of the group.
* Keep service charges reasonable, I see a 20% service charge on a 4 person table with mediocre/poor service I *will* ask you to remove it.

This is my whole point. There is **no one** realistically even close to being available like Bale. All the worlds top wingers are at top clubs and none are looking to move. There are no other options outside of Reus and Cuadrado.

&gt; Just that after Cuadrado, the caliber of players are near world record fee's,which is of course a no go.

Again, this is where you keep getting mistaken. Its not about the fees, not at all. The top wingers are already at top clubs and are happy and winning. You offer 100 million for Robben or Neymar, or Bale or Goetze do you think they will just automatically come to Chelsea? There are much more factors than just money. And none of which are helping us.

My biggest gripe of all is the variable service charge, which varies according to what you buy.

Also I said the next best option after Reus is Cuadrado. That is my main point. If I was being serious about Bale I would of said the next best option is Bale.

Following their twitter feed you can feel how hollow their narrative of being a family run business standing up to imperialist corporate expansion is--they are reaping the benefits of hearing their name regularly in the press. The claim that they are an enterprise rooted in the local community is feeble compared to the club's position and social influence, especially since (correct me if I'm wrong here, from what I've read it appears so) the Haringey council approved the CPO in the first place and the community at large stands to profit from the club's increased revenue in very tangible terms.

Given that the NDP includes space for general retail (the Sainsbury's) and leisure as well as housing, it's kind of baffling that their claim hinges on being part of the fabric of the local community that the club is ""exploiting.""

Archway has profited at the club's expense irrespective of the outcome of the appeal, which comes at a real economic cost to the Tottenham area. 

It would be one thing if the club wanted to gentrify Tottenham entirely and develop commercial spaces for art galleries, Asian fusion small-plate restaurants, artisanal cheesemongers and a boutique olive cannery, but they're providing housing, a primary school, spaces for public use and leisure, and access to fresh food in addition to the stadium-related revenues.

Hello invoice mum! Everyone thinks you're pathetic and need to grow up.

Etiquette advice for the future:

- Don't host a party if you can't afford it

- Expect some no-shows

- Never mention how much you're spending (it's *extremely* rude)

- Try to get a refund from the venue if you think you're entitled to the money back

- Don't argue over a stupidly small amount of money, it makes you look cheap.

- Never under any circumstances send a party guest (in attendance or otherwise) an invoice. It's a party, not a business.

- Never involve a child in adult arguments

- Know when it's time to walk away from a conflict. That time was about an hour before you printed the invoice. It's time to drop this for your own sake and agree to live and let live.",null,0,null,1421716674,null,0,1421717439,0,cnug2z5,null,t3_2sngcw,null,t1_cnug2z5,null,t1_cnu5c9e,null,null,null,1424513760,null,17,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,17,null

I have to ask though as I see it come up a lot on this sub, what's the deal with vitriol towards the middle class as an entity? Why not just ""people who x""?

Seems like everybody loves to bash on some kind of incorporeal middle class which is actually just a group of people who are reasonably well off but not mega rich, equivalent to their surroundings. That group is surely going to contain all sorts, from unintelligent assholes like this, to very intelligent perfectly interesting do-gooding and nice people?

I have absolutely no idea what you mean by this? Mata and Drogba didn't work together? Are you kidding me? Do you not know anything about the most important trophy we have won? Same goes with Ivanovic. And Costa, Schurrle, Matic, Willian? He hardly ever played with these guys, if at all. I am extremely confused by what you are trying to say here.

&gt; Like I said in my first comment. You can sit here and say because Cesc has Diego that you have to give it to Mata, but you can't deny that Cesc's passing ability is better than Mata's. 

You definitely could deny that. I personally think Cesc is the better passer but Mata and Cesc are both incredible passers, and have shown us countless times that they can produce highlight reel throughballs. It  seems like you are just looking to stir the pot here. And yes, I do think the difference between having a player like Costa and Torres is incredibly huge for a playmaker.

&gt; You can't say because they played different positions, because in the system we play now. Mata would have been in Cesc's role. Which he failed at. 

What? I am not really understanding the first part of that, but yes, Mata couldn't play Cesc role. That has nothing to do with his ability in his proper role though. Cesc at Barcelona couldn't play in their system and in Xavi's position, yet he flourishes here in this current system and position. Players all have their own places they do best at, you can't hold that against either of them.

It is claimed that of the KGB budget, 85% went to subversion in ""hostile"" countries. Funding of anti-war demos, communist parties and soft, indirect ways of harming the west.

This article isn't a good one imo because the gist of what it has to say is that it's ""barmy"". I don't disagree but it skips over the subversion actually performed by Soviet agents. It's correct in pointing out that many people suspicious of it believe in a worldwide grand conspiracy though. A common theme with all grand claims about who *really* runs the world. It was a threat in the Cold war era and some vestiges remain. Once something is within the cultural lexicon, it basically stays there forever.

I don't subscribe to the idea that cultural Marxism is this force of evil that has taken root in Western Civilisation and caused its downfall. No it's always far more simple.

I kind of know where you're at - you've finished a book (probably Beginning iPhone Development by Jeff La Marche?), you know a little about Cocoa and the Frameworks Apple provide and how to type some stuff into Xcode and hit compile and able to mess around with some UIViews and simple navigation. 

Setup a Stackoverflow account, a Bitbucket account (It's like Github but has private repositories for free) and get yourself a server and possibly cheap domain. The Digital Cloud do SSD servers for €5 month that are pretty good a playground. If you don't have an iPhone (€200) you'll need to get one as well as a Developers licence if you haven't got one (€85). 

If you haven't already - you'll need to learn a few more technologies - Objective-C isn't enough on it's own. 

You'll need to learn about the ""Stack"". iOS Apps are usually just a front end to a wider service - Apps typically communicate with a server. You will find it massively useful if you know how a program a simple database and setup and API to link your iOS app with making queries to the database. 

The next thing you need to do after this is publish an App. You need to build an App of significance that lets a potential employer mess around with in a interview. 

Thats basically your next step a bigger app that involves a back end. The most important thing here is to pick something fun - something you can't wait to finish. Loads of people get burned out programming after a few years because they're really after money. Take your time and nurse your love for what your doing - iOS Development is fun. Let yourself earn money as you feel comfortable charging for your work. 

Hosting projects on Bitbucket is a good way to show off your code - it will be terrible at first but keep downloading projects from whatever is trending on Github - also sign up to Dave Verwers weekly emails they're quite good for iOS Devs.

I personally think Cesc is the better passer but Mata and Cesc are both incredible passers, and have shown us countless times that they can produce highlight reel throughballs. It seems like you are just looking to stir the pot here. And yes, I do think the difference between having a player like Costa and Torres is incredibly huge for a playmaker.

How is that fair in any shape or form? If you prefer Mata that's cool. But denying Cesc's ability just because Costa is the better finisher than torres is unfair. Cesc's ability has enabled Costa to be successful. You yourself have said Cesc is better at passing. So what is there left to talk about?

&gt;What? I am not really understanding the first part of that, but yes, Mata couldn't play Cesc role. That has nothing to do with his ability in his proper role though. Cesc at Barcelona couldn't play in their system and in Xavi's position, yet he flourishes here in this current system and position. Players all have their own places they do best at, you can't hold that against either of them.

""Proper roles"" mean nothing if you're unable to play a role you're given. You're not always going to have the same role. You're not always going to play the same position. The best are known for their adaptability. Mata was given a role (Cesc's current role) and didn't perform. That's HIS fault. Stop making excuses for it. It was Cesc's fault that he didn't perform at Barca. He didn't have the ability to adapt, others did. Simple as that.

I suppose what I'm worried about is Levy. Namely that, because we've been flirting with the top four, when we lose out on the final day (hopefully to Southampton but probably to the Scum or United) he'll sack Poch and all our good work will be undone. I'm fairly certain he won't, but with Levy... anything's possible, isn't it?

To add to this, I'd take top 8 with a capital one cup victory. I'd really like to win a trophy this season! Especially considering the Scum won one last year.

It's quite normal to try two or more prescription products before hitting the right one, we are all different. 4% nicotinamide (Nicam) and 15% or 20% azelaic acid are probably the gentlest, [nicotinamide AKA niacinamide] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/niacinamide) is more moisturising than drying with regular use.

I don't think that Clarins cleanser is bad at all, assuming you are not sensitive to it. If you have not used for a week or two without using the scrub you won't know what effect it is having, positive or negative. In general melting gel cleansers are non drying as you have found and I find them very gentle (mild rosacea/ eczema/ dermatitis). The manufacturer of [the emulsifier system] (http://www.cossma.com/fileadmin/all/cossma/Archiv/SciencArtic/COS1111_30_ALFA_CHEMICALS_Sucragel_IMPAG_Kosmetikseminar_2011.pdf) that creates the 'melting gel' effect claims it is moisturising. IMO stick with it because you should only patch test and change one product at a time.

Never use granular scrubs on delicate or inflamed facial skin, too harsh. That goes double for a body scrub since body skin is thicker and more resilient than face so scrubs tend to be rougher. Use a chemical exfoliant - see the [AHA/ BHA mega reviews] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2lo783/the_aha_bha_reviews/) is in the sidebar. AHAs are more moisturising and water soluble so can only exfoliate clean skin, BHAs are drying but oil soluble so can penetrate down into the pore.

Moisturisers ... you have the option of a combined moisturiser/ sunscreen or two separate products worrying about sunscreen only when we hit spring. One option is [CeraVe PM lotion] (http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00365DABC/) which has 4% niacinamide and ceramides which help strengthen the skin barrier. If you prefer a gel style moisturiser see the [moisturiser mega reviews] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2ohd33/the_high_street_moisturisers_reviews/) in the sidebar. I'm not the sunscreen guru around here but the reason I mentioned it in the middle of winter is that zinc oxide is also anti microbial and soothing/ calming so ideal for those with acne.

Diet need concentrating on consistently, oftentimes the symptoms you can see are 'the straw that broke the camels back'. A healthy skin barrier keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out. You can't make healthy skin cells without a balanced and varied diet, and skin grows from the bottom up so the cells you see were made weeks ago.

The claims were brought by an ex-green beret and currently works for the pentagon, claiming he was owed hundreds of millions in 'finders fees' for 'finding' an oil field in Kurdistan. His claim was bankrolled by Greek shipping moguls and firms specialised in funding litigation to get a cut of the damages.

- She had this partially reversed in the UK as an adult. Scar tissue remained and her labia were too narrow to allow the baby's head to pass through during birth. 
- The doctor cut through this tissue to allow the birth. 
- He applied two stitches afterwards, sewing the scar tissue back up. The midwife informed him this might be illegal.

There seems to have been a real failing in the pre-birth care here - surely it should have been flagged up that this was going to be an issue in a natural childbirth. 

But there does seem to be a case to answer here. 

&gt;But [prosecutor] Bex said: “The prosecution's case is that a woman's labia should not be sewn together at all unless medically necessary.”

The defence so far is revolving around the doctor thinking he had the patient's consent, rather than that the procedure was medically necessary. 

Edit-

BBC:
&gt;Ten months after the operation, he raised the possibility that it had been ""medically justified"", [Bex] told the court.

Also, to be clear, when I say 'case to answer' I don't mean to imply guilt. Simply that I feel the prosecution is warranted.",null,0,null,1421719988,null,0,1421720769,0,cnuhzly,null,t3_2sxyas,null,t1_cnuhzly,null,t3_2sxyas,null,null,null,1424512872,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,sixthreetwo,newcr-1,"#daretonaisy",null,"The games vs City and West Ham were encouraging - this game against West Brom was interesting because Tony Pulis implemented his defensive strategies to a t and we were stifled and lifeless in attack. I guess what I would like to see for the remainder of the season would be more ballsy tactics and changes made by Martinez in-game. Van Gaal switches up formations from a 3-5-2 to a back four mid game and has the stones to employ a new formation, bench or not bring players (like Falcao) that are not performing etc. Martinez has my faith that if he tries to switch it up, our players are quality enough to handle it. I don't know enough about tactics to say what would suit us best, but I'm just trying to say that when West Brom pull that insane pressing defensive minded strategy, I'd really like to see us have a go and switch our formations to really combat their tactics proactively.


To carry on with strategy and Martinez, I think he definitely should stay. Who are we going to get to replace him? I'm loathe to think of other candidates to come in and do the job. He has the potential to take us higher up the table, and while his Wigan statistics are spooky in the back of my mind, we have to believe in Martinez that he can shake that duck. I say we keep him.


I'm torn between resting dead legs and bleeding the youth - maybe their fire and rawness will lead to a new kind of urgency to combat our lethargic displays of late, but I don't want it to be a confidence blow to our established players. I want our form to pick up before we start playing the likes of Garbutt and Browning etc...I guess it's a catch 22 because what if that is the answer to our poor showings as of late?


I'm still impressed with Joel, and what I saw against West Brom was a keeper who is in inspired form just by the fact that he's been the number 1 for a consistent run of games. Let Howard fight for his spot once he's back, but for now Robles has impressed me and made me a new fan of his.


As for players leaving/staying... I'm a bit worried that we're low on depth as is, and I guess I'm quite attached to who we have. As a reaction to his missed penalty, I guess selling Mirallas for a profit would be alright (and all this is a moot point if he forces a move) but let's not remember how we all swooned over his substitute MOTM performance vs West Ham. I guess I'd be ok with Alcaraz and Distin clearing the wage books, as well as Eto'o. I definitely don't want to see McCarthy leave - if Seamus gets a bid high enough I'd be ok with it. 

I'd take a starting XI like:


Joel

Goalman - Stones - Jags/Browning - Garbutt

Besic - McCarthy

Oviedo - Barkley - Baines

Lukaku


which is crazy, but if Baines can/wants to play in the mid, there's no reason why he couldn't hold down the left mid - his defensive nous in the midfield could stifle a lot of play early, and I'm sure he'd track back. I do love seeing Baines amble near the box too, as he does have the quality to shoot and set a nice though ball. 


I'd say Jags is our captain for more reasons than we see during matches, and while he could've done more to dissuade Mirallas from the corner, he's my guy for the captaincy. Don't know where all this sudden hate for Jags is coming from.


Finally! (whew this is long!) All stay except Distin. McGeady provides depth and while he has the capacity for magic and mayhem, he hasn't had enough of a run for me to want him out.",null,0,null,1421720848,null,0,false,0,cnuihl1,null,t3_2szk0h,null,t1_cnuihl1,null,t3_2szk0h,null,null,null,1424512640,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

One injury and their squad is not nearly as potent. United now have a whole cast of world class players including Falcao and Di Maria (who knows, soon to be Bale??) way less injuries than they had as well. You think Arsenal are gonna finish above United?

I've struggled with facial dryness for my whole life (literally my whole life), so I know how frustrating it is. My first suggestion is to go an see a GP. If it is as bad as you think they will rob ably suggest some sort of mild hydrocortisone. The ones that worked for my face were cream based. They are slightly less powerful than the ointment, but I found that they felt light on my skin and didn't feel like I was wearing paint. I put a layer of Cetaphil or QV flare up, waited until it has FULLY sunk in, then a thin thin thin layer of the cortisone.  Then, if it isn't too hot, I put on a minuscule layer of Vaseline directly before I lay down to sleep. You might have a different experience of Vaseline than I do, but I've just found it is hard to wear when I am awake because I hate the feeling. You might be able to wear it for longer though.

I also use a lush cleanser to exfoliate- it's just small bits if almond so it isn't too harsh, and it gets rid of any scaly bits. However, I know some people have sensitivity to fragrance so it might not be up your alley. No matter what, don't use a super harsh exfoliant. It feels like it is helping, but it's just tearing up your skin. 

I agree with /u/Firefox7275 in that hair products and body washes are what brings my neck and hairline to redness. Check your ingredient lists for irritants. I like Aveeno wash with oatmeal extract- very soothing. 

Finally, have you considered it may be a type of contact allergy? If you get to the GP, maybe bring it up. Irritant contact allergies can present as dermatitis.

null,false,TiocfaidhAllah,irish,Covent Garden,null,"No - there is an absence of a legitimate police force in the North of Ireland, the RUC was basically run by the intelligence services. The Republican community had to police itself.

As said, if someone is dealing drugs or profiterring from criminal activities I believe the Republican movement has every right to tax them as they see fit. I have no issue with the targeting of criminals by Republicans as a way to fund the campaign. 

You have to understand that the IRA bombing campaign was designed to economically cripple Britain, hence why bombs were placed in these locations, whether it be Canary Wharf, Harrods or Warrington. Indeed the campaign was successful in damaging the economy of Britain, both in terms of foreign business being reluctant to invest/pulling out to the cost that the bombs caused. Ironically, a lot of the rebuilding after the bombs was done by Irish building firms. 

With regards to the impact on ordinary peoples lives - this is a war and as said it is regrettable and is not the intention to kill them. Even the British Army has commented on this and some senior figures went as far to praise the IRA for their warnings.

No, collateral damage does not exist. Britain did not care at all about those in Iraq it murdered. The IRA when civilian was killed often came under huge criticism within the movement. It is bad PR, the cause has never been about killing civilians. It's not about murdering civilians at all, the Manchester bomb for example could've taken out thousands, no one died because that was the intention.

I do think the average British person has no idea with regards to the extent of what went on in Ireland, even the branding of it the 'The Troubles' was cleverly done by the British.

Today it is probably the hardest time in history for all liberation movements, particularly in the Western world. Ireland particularly, if the British were stupid enough to put their soldiers on the streets after an IRA attack it would be a catalyst for all out warfare again. Some Republicans would very much like it if the British put their soldiers back on the streets for this very reason. It's got so messy now that there really isn't any solution that wouldn't end in bloodshed. The least bloodshed would come if British left Ireland, but this would likely result in the Loyalist communities going back to their random attacks on anyone who isn't Protestant.",null,0,null,1421724096,null,0,false,0,cnukbsl,null,t3_2srjuw,null,t1_cnukbsl,null,t1_cntpj12,null,null,null,1424511780,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Prepack administration is legitimate in some circumstances but not in others. From what you've described, the director(s) of the failed company propose to continue trading under the same or similar name, using the old company's assets (no doubt acquired at an undervalue) and exploiting its goodwill. If this is correct then your proposed course of action is prohibited under section 216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 - the directors can be made personally liable for the relevant debts and the court has the power to order a fine, imprisonment or both (section 217).

The company sounds like a small one and where there are few directors, it's common for them to be named as co-defendants in the claim. The principle of joint tortfeasance is that the wrongs of the company are inseparable from those of the directors acting on its behalf. If this is the case then setting up a new company won't help you escape personal liability.

You haven't mentioned what you're being sued for, the circumstances leading up to the present day or what the story is behind the £5,000 you're owed - has this fallen due yet? How much is the claimant seeking to recover from you? You should have received a letter before any claim is issued requesting payment or remedial action - is there any scope for negotiation or a payment plan of some sort? If not, are you able to counterclaim for the £5,000?

If the claim is issued then you may want to simply make an admission and offer to pay whatever you can afford by way of installments.

I personally would sacrifice Oscar's defensive ability for Mata's attacking ability. And our biggest issue last year outside of not having a striker, was creativity. Outside of Hazard, we didn't really have anyone to play that killer pass that Mata, and now Fàbregas, does so well.

But he provides us with something none of our attacking midfielders currently do, he gives a lot of natural width being right footed on the right, and he actually likes to play wide. 

Although Willy is righty on the right, he drifts inside and is useful for linking up play and breaking presses and stuff, but we all know he likes to slow down play. Cuadrado is much more similar to Schurrle in the sense that he's a very direct player, LOVES to run, and will  give it a bang if he gets the chance, but he wants to go line and cross instead of cutting inside. 

He's pretty great at beating a defender 1v1, lightning quick, and my favourite attribute: he can whip in an early cross. He's pretty great on the break too, where Willian tends to stop, slow it down (I trust his professional judgement as a player, I've no idea what hes thinking or whether Jose has told him to or he thinks the break is viable), Cuadrado plays with a really high tempo (as far as Serie A goes).

He's got a great defensive work ethic too, so would give a nice counter balance to Ivanovic rampaging forward.

Didn't think anyone else was worthy of the role. Peter Davison annoyed me. I stopped watching for awhile. Then Sylvester McCoy got my attention and won me over. Not as good as Tom Baker but his take was refreshing and kinda dark. I liked that. 

Eccleston was just starting to grow on me when he left. I don't have much to say about his legacy with the role. He was alright. I understand why others remember him fondly. It was sad to see him go so soon, but I can't say I was very broken up about it. 

Tennant blew me away and during his run I found myself almost reluctantly admitting that he was The Best Doctor Ever. So I had to compartmentalize and say Tom Baker was my personal favorite Classic Who Doctor, and David Tennant was the best New Who Doctor, and to compare those two was apples and oranges I couldn't bring myself to do that it was too heart wrenching. Baker is still my personal fave, but damn if Tennant didn't throw down and give it everything he had. His tenure was quite a roller coaster. 

I enjoyed Matt Smith as much as I enjoyed Sylvester McCoy. Not the best, but a respectable performance. He didn't blow my socks off but I particularly enjoyed how he balanced (and sometimes intentionally imbalanced) the Inner Child with the Old Soul. 

Many years later I made myself revisit Peter Davison and had to admit to myself Peter Davison deserved me giving him a more objective view. He was actually rather good at what he did, which was to intentionally not repeat Baker but just find his own angle. I despised him in my youth but I love what he brought to it now. 

Now we got Capaldi who is simultaneously respecting every actor who has held the role before him with his choices and subtleties but also bringing something new to the table, and I'm finding myself realizing there are no best worst or anything like that. They are all great in their own ways. The companions too. Everyone who has ever helped make Doctor Who possible. I can no longer defend any fanboy stance of one actor over another or one character over another. The arguments are silly. It's like dissecting a turkey dinner, claiming the cranberry sauce is the best part of the meal. It's all good. Why ruin it with minutiae? I pretty much love the whole ride from the first Doctor to now and hopefully another twelve or so incarnations to come.

Get rid of some of those episodes devoted to Martha's moping and spend more time making her stronger.)

Also bringing in Reus doesn't make him obsolete at all, because Ancelotti has been deploying him more as a CM than a winger anyways. And no, on the contrary, Madrid fans, who know more than either of us do, said that he asked for a new deal with higher wages and didn't get it, and was thus unhappy, and then obviously once Flo went and got James and Kroos, he felt it would be best for him to go elsewhere, because he was going to be in rotation with those guys and not a guaranteed 1st team player. Ancelotti was perfectly content to go into the season with James, Kroos, and di Maria all as CMs, but di Maria wanted to move, part of that being Flo's fault for buying James, when they really didn't need to. 

This is a pointless debate anyways, Reus to Madrid isn't a done deal yet, and either way if they did get him, it doesn't mean Isco is available, and he isn't even a winger. We're just engaging in a bunch of hypotheticals and getting away from the main point, the main point is there aren't many wingers available who are quality enough for Chelsea. Also, as for what you said above with Cuadrado saying that he's not worth 25-30 mill, you have to remember that 1.) we paid more for Willian 2.) There are very few wingers who meet Jose's requirements, they have to track back at all costs and Cuadrado is one of the few ones who does that.

Yes, the writers didn't really give her the best of chances in her run, but that's because that was what they were using her for - she wasn't so much her own story as a continuation of the Rose one.

It wasn't really until Donna showed up that they put a fresh character who could really drive the plot and show new aspects to The Doctor. And that's why a lot of people - especially people who first discovered Who in the new series - really disliked her. Personally I'm glad that she was such a reversed direction from the ambiguous-girlfriend angle they had pushed for the first three years. Also one major reason I really loved the Ponds, because they tried to waltz her directly into that territory of sexual tension and just made it awkward, allowing the Doctor to be the Doctor instead of a bad analogy for courtship.

Don't get me wrong. I loved Rose and really enjoyed the dynamic between her and Tennant especially. But they really needed to break loose from that whole thing, but I really found it difficult to really see Martha as much beyond the Rose Rebound. And the character suffered expansion due to that. They did a bit better with her occasional appearances in the later RTD days but yeah, that's just my take on it.

Abu Usamah saying of apostates: ""If the imam wants to crucify him he should crucify him. The person is put up on the wood and he's left there to bleed to death for three days.""[4]
Abu Usamah speaking on the deficiency of women's minds: ""Allah has created the woman, even if she gets a PhD, deficient. Her intellect is incomplete, deficient. She may be suffering from hormones that will make her emotional. It takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the man.""[4]
Praises the killer of a British soldier serving in Afghanistan, stating ""The hero of Islam is the one who separated his head from his shoulders.""[5]
Abdullah el-Faisal: ""You have to bomb the Indian businesses, and as for the Jews you kill them physically.""[6]
Advocates violent Jihad against the non-Muslims and predicting that an army of Muslims will arise against the non-Muslims in England.[3]
Dr Bilal Philips on marriage with girls before puberty: ""The prophet Muhammad practically outlined the rules regarding marriage prior to puberty. With his practice, he clarified what is permissible, and that is why we shouldn't have any issues about an older man marrying a younger woman, which is looked down upon by this society today, but we know that Prophet Mohammed practised it, it wasn’t abuse or exploitation, it was marriage.""[4]
Condemns Muslim integration into British society.[3]
Calls for the overthrow of the British government and democracy.[7] ""[T]hey will fight in the cause of Allah. I encourage all of you to be from amongst them, to begin to cultivate ourselves for the time that is fast approaching where the tables are going to turn and the Muslims are going to be in the position of being uppermost in strength, and when that happens, people won’t get killed – unjustly.""[6]
Dr. Mian: ""You are in a situation in which you have to live like a state within a state, until you take over.""[8]
Al Jibali: ""By the age of ten, it becomes an obligation on us to force her to wear hijab, and if she doesn’t wear hijab, we hit her.""[6]
Dr. Mian praised the Saudi religious police practice of imprisoning people who do not pray: ""They send the police, and they say, well, if you don’t come for prayer, close your shop, we will arrest you But if you don’t, then we have to bring the punishment on you, you will be killed, and nobody will pray on you.""[6]
Abu Usamah saying that homosexuals should be killed by throwing them off a cliff, stating ""throw [the homosexual] off the mountain.""[6]

&gt;And no, on the contrary, Madrid fans, who know more than either of us do, said that he asked for a new deal with higher wages and didn't get it, and was thus unhappy, and then obviously once Flo went and got James and Kroos, he felt it would be best for him to go elsewhere, because he was going to be in rotation with those guys and not a guaranteed 1st team player. Ancelotti was perfectly content to go into the season with James, Kroos, and di Maria all as CMs, but di Maria wanted to move, part of that being Flo's fault for buying James, when they really didn't need to.

So what does that mean? It means they forced Di Maria out. They didn't want to pay him a meagre £50k p/w more so they went out and spent hundreds of millions to buy 2 new players who play in the same position he does? Come on. Like no shit he'd want to move after that.

&gt;We're just engaging in a bunch of hypotheticals and getting away from the main point

Umm, no that's what you are doing. I was explaining a scenario where if Madrid signed Reus it would make Isco more eager to move.

You shouldn’t expect special treatment.”  On the other hand, at least he's vaguely forward thinking which puts him a long way ahead of his American political peers.

I guess the at the moment US need the UK as an ally in Europe because of the TTIP and Cameron and his cabinet needs the TTIP to personally profit from.

He also operated with lesser positional discipline and physicality than Cesc does now. 

I also think that if you want Cesc, he does the little things amazingly well, for example, just passing the ball and moving into a better position to receive it again (dat Barca gene shining through), he also recovers and intercepts a LOT more than Mata ever did. 

I think the last thing about Cesc is the interplay. While the Mata-Hazard-Oscar combo had great moments of interplay, they all tended to gravitate into one area of the pitch, but with Cesc, the biggest difference is that (EVEN in his moments of poor discipline rushing forward days in September October) he rarely ever gets drawn into a triangular mish-mash, and in fact always presents a way out of a tricky situation (he only darts into to make that last move - like a late arrival and never hangs around).

I think that in a different age, Mata could have done Cesc's job because at the end of the day I think they have very similar skill sets. But Cesc has more maturity, more experience of playing at the highest level and  is generally a bigger cunt on the field than Mata (which I feel counts for a lot too).",null,0,null,1421737101,null,0,false,0,cnuq7c4,null,t3_2szrfx,null,t1_cnuq7c4,null,t3_2szrfx,null,null,null,1424508971,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

Therefore trying to rid yourself of a phobia by engaging with it to understand the actual dangers in order to realign your psychology is healthy, to have your fears reaffirmed doesn't really make it a phobia anymore, it makes it a legitimate fear creating a state of fear appeal.

Isco is 22, di Maria was 26 when he was sold. Isco has a lot more room to grow than di Maria does, why do you think James was sold for that insane fee? Because of his potential. 

Also, you're ignoring that Ancelotti is using him as a CM and will in the near future as long as he and Isco are at Real Madrid. His improved defensive work rate and superb tackling have made him an excellent CM this year. Therefore there is no need to ship him off if they bring in Reus. In the scenario that Madrid get Reus, Modric is most likely to be shipped off because he's 29, not Isco. You seem to forget that Isco was Ancelotti's first signing, and that under the 4-4-2, Isco would be competing for spots with Modric and Kroos, not Reus. 

You're also forgetting we live in the age of FFP, where we can't just splash a huge amount of cash on 1 player, like 60 million pounds, without selling players. Who is going to bring us around 50 mill pounds of revenue?

\**dons his 'grumpy old man' hat**

Back in the 90s, with the prominence of The X-Files, Millennium, the Star Trek broadcasts, and a lot of other prominent titles, talking about sci-fi shows publicly was a lot more popular in the general public. Particularly the day after an episode broadcast, you could run into random conversations about them anywhere. Coffee shops, office watercooler talk, classrooms, church groups... Just about anywhere that culturally-aware people were gathered, they would talk about the big names and the big events in public with absolutely no ""weird nerd in school"" feeling. 

So it's less that sci-fi isn't mainstream, but that it isn't mainstream *any more*. And when the networks change their emphasis away from ""reality"" shows and towards something else, the mainstream public will shift their attentions as well. We go through these shifts a lot, and only the big networks really control when and where the next trend will appear.

So in my mind, the problem with Doctor Who in America isn't that it's not in the mainstream. Instead, the problem is that it's restricted to BBC America. If the show had a slot on NBC or ABC, the general public would have a lot more of an exposure to it and would be able to be much more mainstream than it is today.",null,0,null,1421738348,null,0,false,0,cnuql7o,null,t3_2sznga,null,t1_cnuql7o,null,t1_cnukpvs,null,null,null,1424508788,null,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7,null

Very few players can handle regular first team football at 17 or 18, and last season he became one of the three or four most important players at the club. Regardless of how promising he had been as a kid, he's been a revelation. You can't run a club on the hope that a 16 or 17 year old is going to be world class in a couple of years.

 We made the right choice in that regard, but not in the case of loaning Assaidi out to Stoke, largely because we had signed Aspas, who wasn't scouted properly and was not a player we needed, and Moses, who was a pretty inexplicable loan signing. Surely it would have made more sense to keep Assaidi at Liverpool rather than loan him out and get someone else on loan to replace him? Moses had a shocking season and didn't seem to care, whereas Assaidi already had a home at Liverpool and had the desire and drive to establish himself. I think he makes a very good point about the transfer policies of big European clubs: big money signings and academy products do seem to get preference over less well known players already at the club. I think we can all agree that Assaidi wouldn't have done a worse job than Moses or Aspas did, and he would have saved us money on transfer fees and wages. But because the club hadn't invested a huge amount in him, and because of his relatively low wages, he was expendable, and thus loaned out, for largely non-football reasons.",null,0,null,1421739882,null,0,false,0,cnur1bl,null,t3_2sz321,null,t1_cnur1bl,null,t1_cnu9p88,null,null,null,1424508579,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

He shoots! He scores! And his passes are awesome!

His passes are awesome from here to there!

Score us a goal! Score us a goal!




Then we leave out the second verse and instead of ""Ba-ba-bamba"" ""Ohhh Lallana!""

It was about 1984-1986 that the big conventions really started to get going. However, if you asked a normal American what Doctor Who was at that time, most would never have heard of it. It was relegated to PBS. Merchandise, aside from the Target novelizations, was virtually non-existent. 

Fast forward to today. Doctor Who may still be a niche show with a cult following, but many more mainstream people follow it. Just as Star Trek has a cult following but there are also casual fans and celebrity fans, so it is the same with Doctor Who. If you ask an average American now, most of them will now have at least have heard of the show. Many will even know the basic concept. The biggest change is the merchandise. It's EVERYWHERE now! Huge displays in Barnes and Noble. T-Shirts in regular shops (I just picked up two at Kohl's, for example), DVDs at Wal-Mart, a giant line of action figures, etc...

1. The earth pin is still used, just because you don't need one for your phone charger it doesn't follow that your fridge, TV, washing machine, PC, kettle, toaster etc don't need one.  It's an important safety feature, I'm pretty sure you'd rather a fault appliance failed directly to earth rather than say through your body.

1. Euro/US style plugs tend to have the cords leaving the socket parallel to the pins, making them easier to pull partially or fully out. UK plugs direct the cable at 90 degrees to the pins and offset the exit so pulling one directly away from the wall twists the plug in the socket rather than pulling it straight out.

null,false,B23vital,null,null,null,"One of the main issues is that private landlords not only make a fortune off rent, but push the price of housing up, to extortionate prices which people cant afford. One simple solution is to build affordable homes which cant be rented for a set period of time.
Currently 59 social homes are being built up from me, non of which i can get from the council and non of which i can buy. A 10minute drive and they are currently building 20 homes for sale, at a minimum price of £150k up to £250k, which in my area is not affordable. The plans also stretch to include more social housing on this estate, something that does not benefit people like me in my position.
When your earning an average salary £25k a year, and the prices of homes are rising exponentially around you its extremely hard to get out of the rent trap.
Im not in favour of a rent cap, but more needs to be done to slow down landlords and increase the sale of homes to those wanting to live in them. 
It is not financially viable for anyone to rent, especially when you can afford rent but not afford to buy the same home. Being in a position where i have no choice but to rent cripples me, saving to buy a home is ridiculous and the downpayment is something that can take years to save while renting. 
Something needs to change, but unfortunately i don't know what that should be, personally i would love to see less landlords, they are a drain on the housing market and only reap to benefit themselves rather than the greater good of the country, but who am i to stop people making a living for themselves.

Here's how I see it: I have a friend who's a scum supporter. Obviously he's never been to Manchester, but he's a 90s kid so I'm pretty sure he's just part of the 'Man U' generation. He's not actually been raised on the team, or been drawn to them by any other reason other than success or wanting to fit in with his glory hunter friends.

The thing is though, though he calls himself a supporter, he just doesn't seem to give a shit when United do badly. He'll half-watch games, shrug, and go and do something else. Even when they win he's not THAT passionate; you can tell he's missing that raw emotional connection to his team.

Now, I'm sure he *believes* wholeheartedly that he is a true supporter of his team, a real fan. But I don't think he is. What he thinks of as being a fan is actually a far shallower, watered down experience than it really is. He just doesn't know any different.

He'd had absolutely appalling service with no apology, so while the waiter stood smugly over his shoulder watching, he keyed in a tip of one penny, which he'd decided was much more telling an indication of crappy service than no tip at all.

We had to apologise to her when he went to the loo because we could tell she wanted the ground to swallow her up.

* [It’s the top destination for people migrating out of London](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/29/young-londoners-flee-capital-region-house-prices)

* It’s the UK’s [start-up hotspot](http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/start-up-britain-report-names-6596764) outside of London.

* Magazines such as [GQ](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2014-10/13/birmingham-city-guide-best-hotels-restaurants-bars-barbers) and Conde Nast Traveller now suggesting it as a tourist destination and claiming it's finally earning its title of Second City.

* The existing 1hr8min virgin Pendelino combined with the promise of HS2 make it manageable for those leaving family behind in the South East.

* [Deutsche Bank](http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/business-news/eyes-banking-world-birmingham-deutsche-7366789) are investing heavily into moving much of their staff – including now front office – into the city, with other investment banks watching carefully this could be the start of a trend. 

* With the influx of the world’s mega rich, the bankers and lawyers earning say £100k-300k, are being priced out of the nice parts of London (that they inhabited a decade or so ago) and are looking for a new playground where they are top dog. That level of disposable income would be a serious boon for the Birmingham economy and house prices.

Still, all of that is very fragile and hypothetical. It’s glimmers of hope (if you can call an influx of bankers hope), but nothing solid.

I addressed the point you made below that in my original comment. When you  have a group deciding on what's needed to live an acceptable life, you end up with far more of these little costs as this 'typical' family includes all the activities of all the group.

Having a look at how they calculate the amount needed They say a family of four needs over £5000 a year for 'social activities' (separate from food and transport costs) which is well beyond that vast majority of people I know with families.

That aside, they still list that standard as needing an income of £37,000 which is roughly that of a family with 1 parent earning £16K once benefits are taken into account (they'd probably get significantly more if it was one parent earning £12K and the other working part time earning £4k too).",null,0,null,1421745493,null,0,false,0,cnuseyp,null,t3_2sx7bj,null,t1_cnuseyp,null,t1_cnucpvt,null,null,null,1424507935,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Many of the hospitals over here have volunteer programmes, volunteers with a little training who provide company for patients, make tea for them and relatives and so forth.

Prior to its closure one of the hospitals was a small community ""cottage"" hospital with a few in patient wards, I spent time as a ward volunteer on a ward with a mix of patients, some recuperating before returning home after a visit to a larger hospital and others with long term conditions e.g. advanced dementia, I would work my way around the ward chatting to each of the patients. One of the patients that I particularly remember was an elderly lady with advanced dementia. If I may be honest I was more than a little uncomfortable, I'm more than a little introverted and it seems be a terrible fate - the very core of what makes an individual stripped away and this elderly lady who once led a rich life was often less engaged with the world that a baby. But there were moments when the person she used to be resurfaced when she was able to chat about her past, when rather than arriving at the ward and seeing her staring vacancy she would be reading a magazine. Those were good days,

I also volunteered at a Welsh general hospital in a number of roles. Again as a ward volunteer on a neurological ward i.e. more patients with dementia. There wasn't much I could do in comparison to the nurses and health care assistants, but what I had was time. I was able to sit with a patient and while I couldn't feed her myself I could gently encourage her to keep eating. I also acted as a runner/porter for pharmacy, taking supplies to wards and about the most (marginally) important thing I did was wrinkly take cytoxic chemotherapy drugs down to the day ward were out patients had treatment. Lots of walking, though it was a good way to learn the layout of the hospital. Finally I also volunteered in A&amp;E, it was just making cups of tea, cleaning and making beds, restocking and keeping patients company.

At the larger Welsh hospital I work in now I know that they have a similar programme, plus they are using Red Cross volunteers in A&amp;E to do a similar patient befriending/tea making role. I wouldn't recommend picking the major trauma centres, but try taking a look at some of the smaller hospitals with an A&amp;E, take a look at the Trusts websites for any volunteer programmes. Alternatively take a look at the Red Cross and see if locally they do any volunteering in hospitals.

For a self employed contractor £3,000 emergency fund is on the low side. I'd aim for at least 6 months of expenses.

Premium bonds hold very little point with that level of savings. The reason being that although the ""typical"" winnings each year amount to 1.3% tax free, the smallest prize is £25 so the odds are skewed.

&gt;The Key Result
&gt;With £3,000 in Premium Bonds, if you have average luck
&gt;you would expect to win roughly £25 over 1 year

Fifteen years later, the country has a thriving right to information law, with almost 44,000 requests made to central government last year, and recently announced it would accept some demands for government data posted using Twitter. So former prime minister Blair must now reflect with pride on delivering his promise?

Not exactly.

Matt Smith showed up on stage and a remix of the Doctor Who theme song was played and the crowd when nuts.

&gt;__Glastonbury Festival__ (originally __Pilton Pop, Blues &amp; Folk Festival__; formerly __Glastonbury Fair__; __Glastonbury CND Festival__; current formal title __Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts__) is a five-day music festival that takes place near [Pilton, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilton,_Somerset), England. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. It is organised by [Michael Eavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eavis) on his own land, Worthy Farm in Pilton. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people,  requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.

Tim Aker has been sacked as Ukip’s policy chief after failing to complete the party’s overdue manifesto.

It is understood that Ukip had set the beginning of January as the deadline to agree policies before sending off the manifesto to be checked and costed by an independent think-tank. Suspicions among senior party figures emerged in recent weeks that Mr Aker was running behind schedule on completing a final draft.

A senior Ukip insider said: “There was growing disquiet that none of us had seen hide nor hair on the policy front. It was especially annoying for candidates, who are banned from making any specific pledges before the manifesto is published. “They don’t know what to tell voters on the doorstep.” 

Several leading Ukip members raised concerns with the party leadership, which led to the discovery that Mr Aker had failed to write a significant part of the manifesto, according to sources. There is now deep concern from some quarters that the document will not be ready in time for Ukip’s spring conference at the end of February.

However, Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s deputy chairwoman, who has been drafted in to finish the manifesto at breakneck speed, saidshe was confident that it would be ready in time. “Tim Aker was responsible for running our policy programme, but as an MEP, borough councillor and PPC [prospective parliamentary candidate] for the target seat of Thurrock he stepped down from the role of policy chief,” she said.

“I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.” Several Ukip candidates and MEPs are understood to be less forgiving of Mr Aker’s failure. One candidate said: “There are many of us who are more than a little angry about this.”

Another insider described Mr Aker as “selfish” for concentrating on his own personal election campaigns, which included a successful bid to become an MEP for the eastern region last May and winning a council seat in Thurrock in November, instead of the manifesto.

Those that they call cultural marxists are often people who agitate against these things not as part of some conspiracy to undermine the traditional family or the paternal capitalist model, but because those things are inherently inegalitarian and remove human dignity from those who would have otherwise been excluded if we did try to fix culture in place in line with a past that is in the past.

There is no such thing as traditional culture, because culture is a moving and changing thing, it exists, as you put it, in a current. That current is not something that cannot be reversed, populist movements like UKIP are a reflection of a segment of the population who feel left behind by the changing cultural values of the UK in the last 30 or so years. However, I believe we can keep the current in a more progressive direction by standing up to racists, being open to foreign cultures, defending rights of people who's values and lifestyles may not be considered traditional, and proactively defending the rights of women in all walks of life.

The idea that landlords will lower conditions or split houses more is rubbish - they already have the incentive to do that. The way to stop that is by tackling the issue and legislating against that. The idea that landlords will just sit on their property is also unconvincing, landlords by and large don't have the cash to sit paying mortgages on empty houses. Thirdly, the idea that they'll go bust, well maybe some of them will have to sell, but that's good, we *want* people who own their own houses, we want people to move from rented to owned - so that they're spending their money creating equity rather just fuelling market overheads. The only way of doing that is by making houses that are currently being rented by landlords available to buy. Finally the idea that the money raised will be swallowed by bureaucracy- well that's an argument against the government doing anything ever, but you can't have it both ways. You can't say that it's going to destroy the rental market at the same time as raising no money. 


Sure, the long term answer is build more houses, but at worst this plan would go some way towards that. We almost certainly need to put more money behind it than only this cap, but this misses the point. I've not heard the other plan, you say something like this and the response is about all sorts of ""Aww well it won't work blah blah blah, we really need to build more houses"" but that's not the alternative.

Here, Brendan, have Balotelli! Striker signed, job done!""

It's a tall order; Clara, still on the brink of the toughening process that series 8 will be, isn't quite up to it (yet).  She says, ""Thanks -- for phoning"" and gives him a big, floppy, Matt-Smith-appropriate hug, for which he is clearly not ready.  So she's seeing the remnants of Matt Smith Doc in him, but not the part she doesn't want to see -- the new man setting out to build a new self on the foundation of the ruins of Matt Smith.  That's why in later eps she seems to backtrack, telling him she doesn't think she knows who he is any more -- she's still taking him for the remnant Matt Smith that she recognized, not the more somber, tetchy, dangerously unbounded man he's becoming.

There's also tremendous pressure to take drugs, drink heavily, harm ourselves to maintain a slim figure, conform socially, and consent to anal sex.

You've gotta take a stand somewhere, teach kids that social pressure can be overcome - and lead by example.

&gt; We can't on the one hand expect people to not spend beyond their means, and then on the other pile a shit-load of pressure to appear to be wealthy, healthy and wise.

You're right, we shouldn't. It's an enormous problem with our society and culture, and it needs to change. It won't be addressed from the top down because there's too much money to be made from it - it has to change from the bottom up. People need to be able to make a stand and say 'no, I'm not doing that'.",null,0,null,1421751200,null,0,false,0,cnutktr,null,t3_2sx7bj,null,t1_cnutktr,null,t1_cntyeus,null,null,null,1424507393,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

There is a small chance however that he could play for ForLove.int !!
