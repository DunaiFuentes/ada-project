The Irish government (and Irish nationalists in general) dislike the term ""British Isles"" that used to be used quite neutrally to refer to the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands, *and Ireland.* Obviously, Northern Irish protestants vehemently disagree, and are very keen to claim ""British"" identity for themselves. So, the exclusion of Ireland from the British Isles, and Britishness can be seen purely as a Irish nationalist affectation.

But there's more...

The whole concept of Britishness, and the promotion of the term ""British Isles"" started to be used be Elizabethans, who explicitly sought to create a more inclusive identity for the peoples subject to the English (and later combined English/Scottish) crown. Viewed from that perspective, the term ""British Isles"" is just Imperialist propaganda.

We have a parliament that has institutionalised a sectarian count before any legislation can be passed. Our parliament has *very* limited powers, it exists - IMO - to ratify decisions made by English politicians. If our own politicians don't behave the way Downing Street wants them to then our Parliament will be suspended. 

We have had decades of chronic underinvestment, we have a large public sector, although a disproportionate amount of these jobs are in administrative rather than front line roles. These jobs have masked poor employment figures for a long time, though they will most likely see massive cuts in the next year or two.

TLDR: sectarian state with a puppet parliament, unemployment has always been high - and looks set to climb higher.

I mean a hugely important thing for me is the reorganisation and increased funding of the military ok? And a serious question for us having buckets of sunshine still. We have to acknowledge the fact that unless we're willing to radically A) increased the budget and B) radically redesign the way we run our conventional forces then we have to make a choice, nuclear or conventional.

I honestly feel that that is the absolute ONLY reason we're still able to sit at the big boys table. If we gave up nukes then we'd be more sidelined and marginalised every day after getting rid of them. So first of all as a nation we have to ask, is it time to fade into obscurity? I mean if the country is willing to say yes and realise that and save the costs then fine, but I think this is what a lot of the middle class left leaning don't realise, they like the prestige that the UK has on the international stage to some degree but don't realise it comes at the cost of us which is about 40bn and change(cost of the upgrade for trident), now that does sound like a lot and it sure as fuck is, but you have to remember that the current nuclear force is about 5% of the defence budget and the overall defence budget is about 6% of the UK total budget, so, we're looking at roughly... 1.2% of the ENTIRETY of the UK budget. So what do we do? I am equally happy with us getting rid of nukes but I would like everyone in the UK to consider before we say that is it, to realise that doing so, in my honest opinion means we do not get to sit at the top tiers of world leadership decisions any more. The UK is already considered a bit of a joke as it is and if we do this, then we finish the last stage of our footnote in history.

I'm for more immigration and fuck the naysayers, I'm for closing the tax loopholes but also dropping the taxes, on the basis of if we can get at least more corporations paying their taxes and thinking well fuck it's not worth it jumping through hoops we might as well pay... because well, look at how ridiculously regulated Greece is, tax evasion is a national pastime over there now.

I could not make myself care less about gay, lesbian, transgender, other, whatever, dragonkin reproductive rights and marriage, look if no one is fucking around and everyone is legally able to make sensible decisions and over the legal age of consent I don't give a monkeys left testicle what gender, orientation or what have you, you are. Do what you want, try not to hurt anyone, don't be a dick/cunt. If a religious institution finds your lifestyle incompatible with their credo then you know what? Tough shit, you don't get to try and force them to marry you. Sure it is who you are, but their rules say who you are isn't ok with who they are. I'm for your freedom, but I'm also for their freedom so trying to make them marry you is not ok, this is why we have registry offices. Adults understand that life is full of compromises and if you absolutely cannot get over something then life is going to be very disappointing for you.

I'm a big believer in rehabilitation for crime, rather than stuffing people in prison as a punishment, I know to some people this sounds like ""re-education"" and get all spookily orwellian, but if you've committed some kind of crime then you have harmed society to a degree and when society tries to defend itself I think it behooves us to not try to also fix the problem at the root.

I also believe in the NHS and frankly if anything the NHS and MoD show me how fucktastically bad the UK gov is at negotiating contracts. My god they suck at it. So so fucking badly. I've always thought of public service as something one should aspire to, but as we see now, with countless govs and cabinet ministers who are completely not trained for the job the endless chopping and changing of policy every 5 years or less has left some of the largest and most important institutions in the UK in just a complete shambles, if we just stuck with one policy or set up for 10 years and said stick with it, I'm sure the NHS would be better off, if it were a Labour or Tory system, but now it's just... yeah I have no words for it.

I'm against the Green belt, while it was a nice idea in its time it is now not fit for purpose. 

I'm for a technocratic government, where actual experts in their fields make the decisions for the various cabinets that they get posted to. 

So please, someone, anyone tell me, who the fuck should I vote for? 

P.S. I'm in Vauxhall and last time I looked my vote was worth 0.068 of a full vote. Yay for incumbency! So while I believe voting is important...

null,false,UnmarkedDoor,null,null,null,"I call bullshit on this until a study takes into account two things, first being how such rise in the production and ingestion of such high thc containing plants had not resulted in a national rise in psychosis. At all.

Secondly, psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and paranoia are widely reported and common effects of smoking cannabis, however tolerance to the effects of cannabinoids are also well documented, but never allowed for, included, or explained in studies like these.

For the second point, I'll just go into why it matters.  You smoke the first time and get very stoned as your system is not at all efficient with dealing with the flood of cannabinoids far beyond what the body would naturally be exposed to (we naturally produce very small amounts, which is why we have receptors for them). The effect is that you feel all the symptoms very strongly. With continual use, the body become much better at dealing with the high levels and so you feel less affected although you could be ingesting the same amount.  The upshot of this is that the higher your tolerance, the lower the intensity of the psychotic symptoms (hallucination, paranoia etc). 

Do people who developed cannabis related psychosis have a broken tolerance mechanism? Does tolerance have any effect at all? 

Incomplete data, research bias, government pressure blah blah blah.

Personally, I think that some people should categorically not smoke cannabis for the safety of their own mental health, the same as I don't think some people should drink. It's not for everybody and everything has associated risks, but until the science can be removed from the politics (probably never), this is all depressingly familiar.

Edit-
And another thing. Unlike the Dutch or the Americans who keep an obsessive tab on strain genealogy and the effects they have (albeit at an amateur, although very capable level), the product on sale in the UK could be anything.  THC has shown links to psychosis. CBD has shown anti psychotic properties. Some strains are higher in one than the other, but what's around is disparate and untested, so again the gaps in the study make me question everything.",null,0,null,1424078662,null,0,1424080238,0,comxtzd,null,t3_2w20pg,null,t1_comxtzd,null,t3_2w20pg,null,null,null,1424617434,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

If we were starting from scratch with our drug laws, with all the information we have now, we would make some very different decisions about what is legal and what isn't.

But the problem we have now is both alcohol and to a decreasing extent tobacco are embedded in our society in a way that cannabis and other drugs never were.  Banning them both would turn an awful lot of ordinary people into criminals, which is a different proposition to keeping the status quo: where those people that smoke cannabis have been and will still be criminals.

The other aspect of this is it could be argued that legalising cannabis will do a certain amount of harm.  There is a lot of debate about whether or not cannabis does harm so this is contentious, but there seems to be enough evidence from health professionals to tell us that cannabis can do some harm in certain circumstances.  

So let's say a prominent politician with lots of clout campaigns to have cannabis legalised, and it happens.  And also lets say that after legalisation there is a small but definite rise in cases of psychosis related to cannabis use.

Funny that, isn't it?  Cannabis use has increased dramatically since the 1970s.  It was virtually unheard of prior to the 1960s and now it's everywhere.  According to Home Office figures, 25% of 16-19 year old use it regularly and up to 50% occasionally (the percentages gradually tail off as age increases).  

Cannabis has also got much stronger and more ""harmful"" according to the Home Office and the other parties who keep telling us how dangerous it is.

So why then have the overall rate of psychosis, schizophrenia and other similar mental health problem remained the same or even dropped slightly over the past 50 years?

**Conservatives**;

First off the name is a bit misleading, they are not really conservative in anything, they are in fact extremists.  Their founding principal is that the poor are a disease that needs to be cleansed, either by starvation measures (sold as sanctions) or by re-inventing slavery for the 21st century.  They are a sexiest misogynistic group who feign extreme puritan values only to over compensate for their seemingly high rate of child molestation sessions carried out by high ranking party members.


**Labour**;

War mongering anti-human sociopaths who's only real political pitch is that 'they are not quite as crazy as the Conservatives', a claim that i can not confirm.  Another party of extreme puritan values that may very likely be hiding an underlying malignancy.  Its said that their last decade's reign robbed us of 300 years of civil liberties, from the right to protest, to even the right to speak in some situations.


**UKIP**;

A party that actually doesn't pretend to be less crazy than the Conservatives, just a little more anti-people (Europeans specifically, but all people generally), naturally they are winning votes with the UK public with this strategy.


**Lib Dems**;

A party that tries to stand for liberty and democracy when their ideals are not being perverted by the Conservatives, naturally they have no chance of getting real power in masochistic Britain.


**Greens**;

An interesting little party that seems to be pro-planet, pro-people and so naturally has no chance in Britain.


**SNP**;

Unfortunately named (includes the word Scotland), preventing them from running in England like English parties can run in Scotland.  Started out as a carbon copy of Labour, even copying some of their more crazy laws back in the Blair years, now seems to be a bit more common sense and pro-human, which would bar them from power if the Conservatives hadn't seriously contaminated Labour during the latest independence referendum.

null,false,Mercc96,eng-kent,Kent,null,"'Skunk' isn't dangerous because it doesn't exist in the way it is presented in our media , there is a skunk family lineage  but really any high THC low CBD strain is 'skunk'. By this measure diesel is skunk, kush is skunk, haze is skunk anything that wasn't grown outside in Lebanon or Morocco is considered skunk. 'Skunk' physcosis appears to be a particularly British phenomenon.

If there is such a strong link between these high THC/low CBD strains and schizophrenia/physcosis then surely someone could point to there being a large increase in hospitalisations in states that have had a medical program for a long time. I'm pretty sure our fine leaders and tabloid press would cheerfully point at all the physco potheads roaming about Humboldt as an example of what could happen to our dear country. 

If this is the case then California really should be teeming with physcotic 30 somethings by now as their cannabis is a lot stronger than what you can generally find over here and they can afford to smoke a lot more of it as well.

Instead suicide rates [fell](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301612) (in men) between the ages of 20 and 39 in those states. So there is definitely likely to be a connection between those living through stressful periods (or existence in the case of mental illness) and the use of cannabis as a form of self medication over other drugs such as alcohol which increases the risk of suicide as it increases impulsiveness and depression as we all know.

The situation in these states allows growers and patients to have their cannabis lab tested, so if someone that maybe did suffer from mental illness has the ability to choose a more suitable ratio of cannabinoids for their needs. 

Customers now want more of the other cannabinoids and terpenes in their cannabis so now the market is responding by breeding and growing their plants differently. 

For there to be such a demand for these other cannabinoids would suggest that there isn't much of a negative impact on the enjoyment of the buzz for those solely after the recreational effects of the plant. In these states the growers now have an incentive to produce a plant closer to how it is naturally in the wild with dispensaries that have been [vetted](http://cleangreencert.com/home/) for their organic production being held in very high regard. 

Our situation is all about fast turnover ,yield and potency, with cash croppers harvesting before CBD production really kicks in and using chemical fertilisers and pesticides that really should not be inhaled. It is this form of cannabis that I believe could maybe be referred to as 'skunk' as it is far from natural cannabis.  Someone could work their way through a bag of 24% THC (but full of terpenoids and other cannabinoids)  dispensary bud and have less paranoia and other issues then smoking through a bag of 12% THC only early bud. 

People don't actually want 'skunk' weed especially not after they've tried properly grown cannabis. Our drug laws just make it so a large amount of the cannabis people have access to is this 'skunk' weed. 

Anyway in 20 years time I don't think a lot of people will be smoking flower regularly any more due to how much cleaner and safer concentrates are.

Putting that to one side, answer this questions: Are you prepared to pay a little more upfront in exchange for budgeting certainty for the length of your fix?

A fixed rate mortgage is effectively a budgeting insurance policy. The bank takes the risk that interest rates will rise in exchange for a higher interest rate today. Think of it like an insurance policy and if you're happy to pay the ""premium"" (i.e. the difference between the cheapest variable rate and the fix), then do it.

There are caveats; usually fixed mortgages have tighter terms (exit fees during the fix, inability to make overpayments or limited to, say, 10% PA). Make sure these won't unduly disadvantage you.

Also, bear in mind that a 95% mortgage will cost you significantly more (generally) than a 90% mortgage.

Another point I'd like to make is that most strains of weed are far less dangerous to consume than alcohol or cigarettes and Hash (the weed the article describes as the less potent stuff) is usually much more potent than most weed you get on the street anyway.  
  
The argument this article is putting forward for keeping weed illegal is the equivalent of saying that because absinthe exists, we should ban all forms of alcohol. (even white spirit and rubbing alcohol because hemp is illegal to grow too.)  
  
A Reason to decriminalise weed is that if you get caught and get a criminal record, it will be a lot harder to find work and people turn to more crime as a way to make money.

Maybe if you got off your high horse you'd see that.

To benchmark.

The UK’s debt limit was set at 40% prior to the crisis. Why? Because that was seen as a safe limit that didn’t leave the country exposed to potential downturns. Today debt stands at a little over 88% depending on where you look.

Research has shown that “*A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). That’s the Tory plan, its ambitious and still leaves us well short of the 40% safe limit by 2030.

Now debt as many people point out is not bad, however debt you cannot repay is very bad and will spook the market. Currently we are the UK is a safe pair of hands and pay very low interest on bonds, lets not take liberty with that. As noted above even the most prudent government will not get debt back to a safe level by 2030. Japan is a case of where a government has lost pace with it’s debt, first Japan had it’s own crash in the early 90s then it had the Asia crash in the late 90s then finally the global crash we all experienced. Each time Japan has had to take on more debt, leaving it now in a very precarious situation, they didn’t plan it, they doesn’t want it, but now in the space of 25 years they are stuck with a very big problem. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njp8bKpi-vg). Now we all know the UK is miles from debt to GDP ratio of 250% but “*The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The sort of additional borrowing that we were able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). 


So what risks could we face?

* Unstable coalition government
* Eurozone stagnation (very big worry, is they don’t grow they can’t buy our goods)
* A Chinese slow down or crash
*  Cyclical recession

This admittedly where my knowledge runs out, but the nature of crisis is that they often come out of the blue.


On top of this we are in the run up to the UK’s biggest demographic transition the rise of the dependent baby boomers, who will be retiring and dying. This will present a huge strain on services is going to require careful fiscal management and perhaps even a notable deficit to be run depending who is in government. Entering that with debt still high could be very dangerous.

null,false,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,null,"From [this article](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html):

&gt;In 2013, Bostrom conducted a survey that asked hundreds of AI experts at a series of conferences the following question: “When do you predict human-level AGI will be achieved?” and asked them to name an optimistic year (one in which they believe there’s a 10% chance we’ll have AGI), a realistic guess (a year they believe there’s a 50% chance of AGI—i.e. after that year they think it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI), and a safe guess (the earliest year by which they can say with 90% certainty we’ll have AGI). Gathered together as one data set, here were the results:2

&gt;Median optimistic year (10% likelihood): 2022  
&gt;Median realistic year (50% likelihood): 2040  
&gt;Median pessimistic year (90% likelihood): 2075  

&gt;So the median participant thinks it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI 25 years from now. The 90% median answer of 2075 means that if you’re a teenager right now, the median respondent, along with over half of the group of AI experts, is almost certain AGI will happen within your lifetime.

Correct. But if you stop growing your debt won't, it will keep rising, much like the problems France, Spain and Italy are encountering. Their economies are not growing and debt is rising. 


&gt;The risk associated to debt should be measured by the interest rates you pay, and the UK currently pays very low interest rates for its debts.

We do and it is not something that we should take liberties with, we are not the USA, we do not hold the world reserve currency. 

&gt;The long term viability of debt is crucially linked to demographic development, and as the UK is projected to keep growing in population the per capita debt will decrease that way, too (as opposed to Germany, that really needs to bring down the debt now rather than later).

You are of course completely correct. However my perspective on this is.    

Research has shown that “*A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). That’s the Tory plan, its ambitious and still leaves us well short of the 40% safe limit originally set by 2030.

Now debt as many people point out is not bad, however debt you cannot repay is very bad and will spook the market. Currently we are the UK is a safe pair of hands and pay very low interest on bonds, lets not take liberty with that. As noted above even the most prudent government will not get debt back to a safe level by 2030. Japan is a case of where a government has lost pace with it’s debt, first Japan had it’s own crash in the early 90s then it had the Asia crash in the late 90s then finally the global crash we all experienced. Each time Japan has had to take on more debt, leaving it now in a very precarious situation, they didn’t plan it, they doesn’t want it, but now in the space of 25 years they are stuck with a very big problem. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njp8bKpi-vg). Now we all know the UK is miles from debt to GDP ratio of 250% but “*The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The sort of additional borrowing that we were able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). 




&gt;Tory government is planning to bring spending down to levels not seen in this century.


To be fair the spending we saw from Labour was unfunded, we haven't really been living within our means for the best part of a decade.    



&gt;Inequality is also a potential driver of future economic risk. And while the UK debt is historically moderate, UK inequality is historically high.


It is, although I would argue large scale unemployment, like the 25% level we see in southern Europe is far more detrimental. Again it is a choice, we have flexible labour markets, which means that in times like this employment can recover but that workers will not be protected to the same degree. It's not a clear choice.


&gt;Best example of this is the NHS policies.

I agree, although we are going to face a big decision with the NHS in a few years, a decision many people aren't going to like as it will require them paying a lot more and not getting anything in return. I'm of course referring to the UK’s biggest demographic transition the rise of the dependent baby boomers, who will be retiring and dying. This will present a huge strain on services is going to require careful fiscal management and perhaps even a notable deficit to be run depending who is in government. All governments will try to wiggle out of this as it will eat up so much of their spending, it is again another example IMO of why having a high debt level in in 2030 is going to be dangerous.

[But this is by Andrew Ng.](https://medium.com/backchannel/google-brains-co-inventor-tells-why-hes-building-chinese-neural-networks-662d03a8b548).

&gt;There’s a big difference between intelligence and sentience. Our software is becoming more intelligent, but that does not imply it is about to become sentient.

He acknowledges the threat that self-driving cars pose to the large number of people who drive for a living - but the idea of AGI is frankly a fantasy at the moment.

The people I would listen to on AI are Andrew Ng, Peter Norvig, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio. When those guys start seriously talking about AGI (and I follow all of them on Google+/Facebook/Twitter) rather than just being irritated by the media sensationalism - then I will take it seriously. Demis Hassabis is also incredibly intelligent but seems like he can be a bit of a showman at times (but goddamn I can't wait to see them get the new DeepMind project working on Quake)

Nick Bostrom is a philosopher not a machine learning/artificial intelligence researcher nor a computational neuroscientist (although he did study computational neuroscience for a while, to his credit). His living depends upon people considering 'existential risk' a big deal - and AGI is often considered to be such a risk.

So he has a vested interest in hyping it up - but at the moment it is a fantasy and will probably remain so for at least 50 years if not longer.",null,0,null,1424086564,null,0,false,0,comzds2,null,t3_2w1lo9,null,t1_comzds2,null,t1_comz76e,null,null,null,1424618227,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Ask yourself why, really ask yourself, are these people stupid? No clearly not, ok then why are they pursing this plan of action. 

This is my take on it and the reasons why I am almost certainly going to vote Tory.    


The UK’s debt limit was set at 40% prior to the crisis. Why? Because that was seen as a safe limit that didn’t leave the country exposed to potential downturns. Today debt stands at a little over 88% depending on where you look.

Research has shown that “*A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). That’s the Tory plan, its ambitious and still leaves us well short of the 40% safe limit by 2030.

Now debt as many people point out is not bad, however debt you cannot repay is very bad and will spook the market. Currently we are the UK is a safe pair of hands and pay very low interest on bonds, lets not take liberty with that. As noted above even the most prudent government will not get debt back to a safe level by 2030. Japan is a case of where a government has lost pace with it’s debt, first Japan had it’s own crash in the early 90s then it had the Asia crash in the late 90s then finally the global crash we all experienced. Each time Japan has had to take on more debt, leaving it now in a very precarious situation, they didn’t plan it, they doesn’t want it, but now in the space of 25 years they are stuck with a very big problem. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njp8bKpi-vg). Now we all know the UK is miles from debt to GDP ratio of 250% but “*The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The sort of additional borrowing that we were able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). 


So what risks could we face?

* Unstable coalition government
* Eurozone stagnation (very big worry, is they don’t grow they can’t buy our goods)
* A Chinese slow down or crash
*  Cyclical recession

This admittedly where my knowledge runs out, but the nature of crisis is that they often come out of the blue.


On top of this we are in the run up to the UK’s biggest demographic transition the rise of the dependent baby boomers, who will be retiring and dying. This will present a huge strain on services is going to require careful fiscal management and perhaps even a notable deficit to be run depending who is in government. Entering that with debt still high could be very dangerous.

I agree with you on alcohol and Tobacco, they kill a lot more then other drugs do. But do you not think that because they are legal that they are so damaging?

I'm not justifying that these substances should be legal, and the fact that they are legal means that tax is levied on them, though this will probably not cover the gross costs for the government.

&gt; If you mean compared to a few years ago then year sure it is but again it's just slower to grow due to its size if you compare it to similar economies it's doing rather well.

Again this is an extremely simplistic and naive view of economics; it is in fact Nonsense.

&gt; Britain's bounceback from recession is among the weakest in the EU. Only Portugal and Greece have lower growth over the last year. George Osborne blames the euro crisis, but the economy has flatlined since the summer of 2010, and many economists expect Britain to teeter on the brink of recession in the months ahead. UK debt is larger than any in Europe except Greece as a proportion of GDP if household, business and bank debt is added to government borrowing – about 460% of GDP, says consultancy firm McKinsey. 

[If you want a side by side comparison with a similar sized economy read this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/britain-germany-economies-eurozone-crisis). Spoiler alert: the UK does not fare well.

It's not wrong, but what does it really tell us? 

Could you justify prohibiting alcohol with a study showing that moonshine makes people go blind? 

I don't doubt that cannabis use has the potential to be dangerous, but surely there has to be an extent to which the danger is enhanced (or even created) by the fact that it is illegal and therefore unregulated. It's all very well saying that it is illegal because it is harmful, but clearly the reverse is also true. 

From the article:

&gt;Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King's, commented: ""This paper suggests that we could prevent almost one quarter of cases of psychosis if no-one smoked high potency cannabis.

If there were more options available than the high potency stuff, would as many people use it? If potency was regulated and high strength cannabis was kept illegal, would most people not prefer to  buy at the legal strengths rather than take the risks associated with buying illegal drugs? 

The commenting politicians are doing a very good job of ignoring the parts of the study that demonstrate that lower potency cannabis does not share the same harmful effects as ""skunk"". Would it not make more sense to find a way of getting all the people who are currently smoking skunk to smoke less potent cannabis instead? That is rather than trying to get them to smoke nothing at all (""trying"" in this case meaning ""punishing them for doing it, but presenting no alternative""), which has consistently shown itself to be entirely unworkable.",null,0,null,1424087431,null,0,false,0,comzk86,null,t3_2w20pg,null,t1_comzk86,null,t3_2w20pg,null,null,null,1424618311,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I wish I could find it, but there was a documentary on BBC One, it had nothing to do with drugs and was looking at schizophrenia in young people. 

Incidentally one person talked about how his schizophrenia was triggered. He was smoking pot, then started hearing voices which made him paranoid, thinking his friends where hiding in his room talking.

He realized it was the drugs, relaxed a bit then went to sleep.

The next day the voices came back and have been with him ever since.

That sort of shit scares me, Its like, fair play if you want to do drugs that's fine. But a drug that can cause this (trigger it whatever) in an albeit small portion of the population should really be made illegal in order to protect that small portion of the population.

First a note. Political Compass can help you identify a name for your overall political philosophy. It isn't perfect but it got me right about 7-8 years ago when I first used it and got it right again recently when I rechecked after becoming more politically aware and well read. From there you can research the philosophies more. Wikipedia is a perfectly acceptable start, it'll also recommend writers and leaders from across the spectrum. Vote for Policies is similar but gives a few parties in Britain appropriate to your philosophy. Again I've found it generally accurate when seen in that light.

This is different from practical politics for me though. I consider my views in the anarcho-communist spectrum overall, but I don't vote that way as in practical terms it makes little difference. I espouse them when and where possible but will typically vote Labour or Green. This is practical politics. From many people with Communist/Anarchist or other less mainstream views, short of joining the oft fragmented and sidelined movements (which is fine, but not always easy or practical) this is the only choice. So I make a decision based on manifesto policies and past competence of them, informed by my philosophies and current events. In local elections I will be more forthright as there is often more chance of getting a socialist candidate in.

So use those questions, read all these great comments and pay careful attention to misinformation and propaganda from certain parts fo the media. If it sound too good to be true or too bad to be false, dig deeper. And always be aware of your own faults.

A percentage of them probably wouldn't have lived long enough to become alcoholics either through drinking impure alcohol or methanol (I mean its not like they can just buy budweiser from a dealer since its illegal) , much like the brick dust and other stuff heroin users deal with now. Lets not forget that illegal profits to be made usually bring with them organized crime and violence. Alcohol would definitely be more lethal then it is now if it were illegal so your right there are alcoholics out there that probably wouldn't be if they had to buy their first beers from a dealer because they would be dead by now.

In terms of making an ill informed decision surely its better for someone curious about trying heroin for the first time to procure it from a trained physician and use it in a shooting gallery with nurses present then buy it from the darknet and misjudge the potency?

Heroin will never be sold like alcohol at least not in our lifetimes maybe in a distance neo-hedonist future or something.

As a spurs fan I think the tantrum he threw, which was petulant was also because he thought he wasn't an interim  manager or whatever you want to call it but everyone else (including the players) knew he was. That made some of the decisions he was making, like playing 19 year olds instead of players signed for £26 million and £17 in Paulinho &amp; Soldado problematic as obviously is ruffled a lot of feathers in our squad and the general reaction seemed to be, fuck this guy he's gone at the end of the year anyway. So I don't think it would help you guy at all if he had a contract of that length 

I am surprised by how negative the overall reaction is, in my view Villa are a team with a squad good enough that if they play to their potential they will stay up. He showed at us that is exactly what he can make a squad do. Tactically he did fuck it up against Chelsea &amp; Arsenal and Liverpool for us but he also got the team doing basics well again. 

Our best striker was scoring goals, our most creative player had the most freedom, he dropped player who didn't seem up to it and played players who were, which I think is exactly what you need in your position. 

I would be really shocked if he sent you down and I also think he can be a huge catalyst for you regaining some direction with youth.

Stalled at a red light and got flustered trying to get it started again (kickstart only) then immediately gunned it without checking to see if the light had turned. It had; fortunately I didn't get hit by any of the 50mph traffic going the other way.

Stalled about 100 feet from my flat as a car was pulling out. Out of frustration I gave it a bunch of throttle as I was starting it up and then accidentally dumped the clutch. Ended up hurtling towards the car with my front wheel in the air, at which point I attempted to stop myself by grabbing the front brake. Strangely it didn't seem to help much.

Broke down 10 miles from home. It would start up, go for a few yards and then lose power and stall.

It's not the individuals fault, always society. Unless of course you're either a Tory or a Banker in which case not only is everything that happens to you your own fault but also everything bad that happens to anybody else.

I don't hate the idea of any personal responsibility.  I just think that someone's socio-economic background and environment have a great effect on the person they become.  Often when people talk about ""personal responsibility"" they ignore these things, and aren't interested in addressing them.  Social mobility is getting worse, socio-economic standing is something that is handed down from parent to child.  Someone in in a lower socio-economic class is more likely to smoke, use drugs and commit crimes.  Do you see how the entire concept of personal responsibility becomes diminished when this is accounted for?  I'm not saying that we shouldn't hold people accountable for their actions, but if we ignore the root of the problem, then the cycle will continue and so will the need to deal with the consequences.

Personal responsibility exists to some extent, but the environment and society a person lives in has an undeniable effect on who they are.  Since socio-economic status is more often than not passed down from parent to child, then is it unreasonable to expect the government to at least attempt to help break the cycle given the huge effect they have on the society we live in?

&gt;Even obesity is the fault of the Government and the Corporations.

I'm not sure I'd say it's the government's fault, but they certainly have an the opportunity to vastly reduce obesity.  The government controls public facilities, the school curriculum and infrastructure.   Imagine if the government decided to invest in more play parks, more football pitches/basketball courts.

That links to a four year prospective study of &gt;2,000 people. At the start of the follow-up they measured someone's predisposition to psychosis. At the end of the follow-up they saw how often they had used cannabis. They found that psychosis predisposition did not predict cannabis use later on, which would refute the 'self-medication' hypothesis. 

They conclude:

'Cannabis use moderately increases the risk of psychotic symptoms in young people but has a much stronger effect in those with evidence of predisposition for psychosis.'

'Predisposition psychosis at baseline did not predict cannabis use at follow up, thus refuting the self medication hypothesis'

http://jop.sagepub.com/content/19/2/187.short

The above link is a systematic review of the literature concerning psychosis and cannabis. It looked at 11 different studies and summarised the findings. Some quotes from this article:

'The metaanalysis suggests that cannabis is a risk factor, increasing the chances
of developing schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like psychotic illness
by approximately three-fold.

'Doubts have been raised about the self-medication hypothesis
(Smit et al., 2003) in view of cannabis remaining a risk factor for
schizophrenia even when premorbid psychotic symptoms are controlled
for.'

We certainly don't want soap box orators calling on crowds to attack people for the colour of their skin or their religion or some other hate reason.

But by banning free speech with regard to hate speech it means that rather petty arguments are technically crimes.

That puts the police in a bind. If the newspapers weren't involved I'm sure the police would quietly let this drop. However they can't be seen to be condoning illegal hate speech because that would leave them open to allegations of racism.

There's also the issue that the law isn't applied evenly. People are quite often rude about white people in public without having the police involved. Now I'm certainly not saying white people have an unfairly tough time, we don't, but it's bad in principle to have a law that is only enforced given certain permutations of skin colour. For example: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16423278 Diane Abbott seems just as rude and as generalising as the woman in this tube incident.

I'm also uncomfortable that the woman's face is shown in the national press so clearly. It opens her up to revenge attacks or getting sacked etc. Remember she is not at this time proven guilty in law.

A group of people who are the same as each other will only ever move forward in a way that they all agree with, whether it's for the greater good or not. Diversity brings different opinions, thoughts, life experiences, understanding, perception and this leads to growth and change. This might not always been comfortable/pleasant on the way, but I believe it is growth and change that has a better chance of suiting a wider range of people - i.e. the general population. This can be at a macro or micro levels. 

You can hold your breath, shut your eyes and stand still but the world will still be moving and so change is inevitable, we might as well make the best of it. 

And by diversity I mean ethnicity, race, age, gender, social-economic background - all of it!

Each human having a better understanding of the different humans around them can only be a good thing.

I might be reading it incorrectly, but that doesn't strike me as a valid conclusion.  
Being predisposed to psychosis doesn't necessarily *cause* you to self-medicate (so you can't predict the one from the other), but that doesn't mean some people don't do it.  
  
&gt; ""The metaanalysis suggests that cannabis is a risk factor, increasing the chances of developing schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like psychotic illness by approximately three-fold""  

I don't think lumping schizophrenia together with a loosely-defined term like 'schizophrenia-like psychotic illness' does anyone any favours!  
  
I found the abstract a bit more persuasive:  
   
&gt; ""Early use of cannabis did appear to increase the risk of psychosis. For psychotic symptoms, a dose-related effect of cannabis use was seen, with vulnerable groups including individuals who used cannabis during adolescence, those who had previously experienced psychotic symptoms, and those at high genetic risk of developing schizophrenia.""
  
That makes more sense. Early use is particularly dangerous with lots of drugs - tobacco and alcohol included - so I don't think it should come as a surprise that this is the case with cannabis use as well. What they seem to be saying is that cannabis is a risk factor for triggering an attack, rather than it being a risk-factor for 'catching' schizophrenia if you weren't previously pre-disposed to it.

Not sure I completely agree with you on Lib Dem and Green though. 

Lib Dems have unapologetically broken many of their election promises. I would have been ok with it if Clegg said ""we tried but we can't because hung parliament"" but instead he said ""oh we changed our minds."" These were on very important issues which to me were the few concrete positions I could support (given that labour and tory manage to make noises without saying anything). The spinelessness and contempt with which he said things like ""oh we're going to have to find things to disagree about"" and paying no attention to any of the election promises demonstrates the integrity of that party.

Greens - well, the candidates I have spoken to certainly have an accute understanding of politicts from a scientific/Marxist perspective. When I saw Marxist I mean the critical analysis employing dialectical-materialism; not communist ideologies. I'm sure there are some candidates that are reactionary eco-nuts but I wouldn't go so far as to call them completely incompetent. I also would stop a long way short of calling them socialists. Social-democrats, perhaps, but even that might be a stretch. _Socialism_ requires dismantling the capitalist framework, something that afaik the greens aren't planning on doing.

Also ""hardcore socialism wrapped in environmentalism"" is redundant because socialism is intended to be environmentally responsible. For example, psuedo-socialist Cuba is only the 5th country in the world and first in Latin American to [build a plant for recycling CFCs](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Cuban-Plant-to-Destroy-Substances-Depleting-the-Ozone-Layer-20141109-0019.html) and replants 27,000 hectares of forest a year in [the most advanced reforestation program in the region](http://repeatingislands.com/2011/04/21/cuba%E2%80%99s-reforestation-program-most-advanced-in-the-region/). AND they almost exclusively use [sustainable farming practices](http://modernfarmer.com/2014/11/cuban-farming-stepping-backward-future/).

Your comments on Ukraine are, ironically, idealistic and naive. Poroshenko's rise to power was supported by the West, and Poroshenko's military provides de facto support for powerful [far right paramilitary groups](http://i.imgur.com/k9FXJpZ.png) such as [Azov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion) and [Right Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector). Azov took 900 weapons from a weapons cache, handed 300 over to Poroshenko and kept the rest. They are in constant contact with the official military and frequently phone up artilliary commanders and ask them to shell specific areas. The next thing I'm gonig to say is mostly speculative, but supported by evidence and precedence - Ukraine is of strategic importance to Nato and they will willingly support fascists and spread anti-Russian propaganda to achieve control of the region. If Nato ever engages in non-clandestine activity in Ukraine I can _promise_ you that, like Libya, it will not be for the poor innocent civilians locked in the civil war, it will be for geo-strategic reasons.

What's puzzling about this is that what the lady said is exactly what children are taught at school during Black History Month: many persons of African origin are descended from slaves. This is true. Odd that when she says it the police investigate. Could it be to do with the colour of her skin?

Also odd is that the police would be investigating YouTube videos at all. Was this brought to their attention or do they spend a lot of time online? Just yesterday, again, we were being told that due to the city in resources the police had to return to basic crime-fighting and could no longer police a political demonstration. 

There are cases of assault and verbal threats l by security guards, likewise recorded on camera, where the police refuse to do anything, even to speak to the accused. 

All this is very disturbing. 

The last is, of course, wrong to say this guy used to be a slave, even if by that she means ""is descended from slaves"" because like many of African descent in this country, he appears to be from Africa proper and never had anything to do with slavery. 

But that's neither here nor there. You can't deny people the right to speak because what they say is false.

null,false,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,null,"Another historical mixup, I'm afraid. While Dev did 'pay his respects' to Hitler after his death, he did so as head of state out of obligation to make it clear that we were neutral, and more importantly - because it was actually in despite at that time - to make clear who in fact *was* our head of state. Britain at the time still contended that we had (Australia-style) kept your monarch as HOS. Even that did not apparently clarify things enough, as we had to go ahead and institute a new constitution a couple of years later that plainly called the state a republic, and George VI did us all a favour by kicking the bucket shortly thereafter, whereupon Liz upon coronation affirmed this by rewriting her official regal title.

Furthermore, Dev's Fianna Fail were a centrist 'republican' party, and were 'pro-' neither the Nazis nor the communists; Ireland, while neutral, adopted a 'pacifist-Allied' stance where passive help to the Allies was given - for instance, any combatants caught in Ireland were rounded up... and handed straight to the grateful British government.

Ireland's 'nazi' party before the war the time was Fine Gael who began as merging of some political groups with the Blueshirts, a group of extremists lead by Eoin O'Duffy, similar to your Oswald Mosley.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a non-smoker of cannabis, but I drink alcohol and smoke tobacco quite a lot, and am almost certainly harmed by both significantly, and legally. 

25% of new cases of psychosis being linked to heavy adolescent cannabis use does suggest there is a causal link, although this is not concrete as those predisposed to psychosis may also be predisposed to heavy adolescent cannabis use.

However, EVEN IF heavy cannabis use in adolescence is causally linked to psychosis, this is still not a significant proportion in the general population.

According to a study referred to on the NHS website [here](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Psychosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx), 3 in 100 people will have 'at least one episode of psychosis at some point during their life.'

The Home Office line that keeping cannabis illegal is predicated on studies like this implies that it is illegal to protect less than 1% of the population from developing some form of psychosis, a link which, as I have mentioned above, is not necessarily causal.

If decriminalised, heavy adolescent use would be treated as a medical issue, and potentially resultant psychosis (among &lt;1%) could be avoided. 

It is the Home Office's rhetoric and stubbornness that is the root of the issue, and the idea, that cannabis use would become ubiquitous and more harmful upon decriminalisation or even legalisation, would be significantly more laughable if it weren't so dangerous.

Manquillo was playing better at times than Glen Johnson and now Markovic and Ibe has been playing really well in the wingback spot. So it will be almost impossible for him to take that spot away from them at this point, because they are not going to give it back. 

He is not going to sign a new contract where he will earn a lot less than he does now. Which is between 90-110 if i remember correctly. So Rodgers might be wanting got give playing time to other players.

It's something that irritates me quite a lot, when young people chirp and cry about freedom of speech and then don't bother to actually vote, which is arguably the greatest freedom of all, to decide the people who make the laws to which your freedom pertains. At least by turning up, you may have a sudden moment of realisation. If not, then that's fine, spoil your ballot. But at least turn up. There are so many people in the world who don't get to choose their leader, people who do should make the most of it.

Just making it compulsory registration means that people still won't turn up. Having said that, I'm not sure about the figures regarding the number of people who sign up vs. the number of people who turn up but I'd wager that it's fairly close. If you've made the effort to register for voting when it's optional then invariably you're going to turn up on the day.

Cyclists who campaign for strict/presumed liability ARE the sort of cyclists who want it as much for pedestrians and themselves. The pedestrian element is usually one of the main under riding arguments for it. 


You might think there's some ulterior motive here, but there's not...

Unfortunately, in today's world, you need money to do anything really. I don't agree with it but it's the way it is.

This should be the case.

null,false,unbrokenreality,eng-Bristol,Bristol,null,"Well, firstly there's this lovely quote:
&gt; If you hit a cyclist, the police caught you and the CPS decided to prosecute you (don't laugh, it does happen), you would be tried under criminal law.

Which seems to assume that if a motorist hits a cyclist it's automatically the motorists fault.  Which anyone with any common sense can hopefully see is not true.  Which sadly shows the bias of the writer. 

Secondly, 

&gt; the only pain you'd feel would be a rise in your premiums (which would happen anyway, regardless of whose fault the collision was)

Again, no.  If it's not your fault, there is no reason for your premiums to go up.  I've had plenty of clients who haven't had their premiums increase as a result of a no-fault incident. 

Thirdly:

&gt; It's amazing how many people get this basic point wrong, and often it's not the rabid petrolheads, it's cyclists themselves who think that strict liability will mean more criminal prosecutions.

Yes, it is amazing how many people get this basic point wrong.  Including the writer of the article. 

Fourthly, as I mentioned:
&gt; In the UK we already have strict liability for at least one type of road collision: the rear-end shunt. If two cars collide in this way it's automatically the fault of the driver behind.

No. Just no.  There is no such law.  There isn't even a presumed liability one.  It's true that it is hard to argue a rear end shunt situation but there is no strict or presumed liability in these situations. 

Also, the petition the article is linked to gives this statistic:

&gt; In accidents where a cyclist was killed or badly hurt the cyclist was presumed to have committed an offence in just 6% of cases [1], the vehicle driver was assumed to have done so 56% of the time

Statistics are great aren't they.  Turning this one around, you could just as well say that 44% of motorists involved in these collisions have not committed an offence.  Why should they then be penalised?

As a picky thing, they also keep on about the law in the UK.  There are separate legal systems for England and Wales, Scotland, and N Ireland, they really need to be clear which legal system they are talking about.

I'm not getting at cyclists, believe me I'm not - I act on behalf of a lot of them in my line of work and to be blunt, this type of law would be beneficial to my work.  But I just don't think it's right or ethical.

I believe that Sofia, which has a population of a couple of hundred thousand more than Birmingham, is the largest local authority in Europe, if you count the local authority area as being the absolute lowest level of government. Whilst each district of Sofia elects a mayor, they only have delegated powers from the municipal council. Also, there are other municipal authorities in Europe that are larger than Birmingham, albeit with some power devolved to districts within the local authority area. But that happens in Birmingham too: there is one parish council, New Frankley, within the boundaries of Birmingham's local authority area.

Birmingham City Council will almost certainly have a larger budget than Sofia, however.

Now in my eyes why should someone  be allowed to abuse another and get away with it? While in this case it appears the person argues  back. But I would guess in most people wont mainly just because they don't want to escalate or even they just don't like being cruel to another person. 

Another line that is often thrown around is personal freedoms, which is all good and such but quite a large number of these same people who cry for right to be racists but will also complain about someone doing something different. Before you say you don't, you feel there just living there is enough of warrant an insult and some (and i would argue this is a small minority) think people should die for it.

There also another thing about libertarianism It tends to lead to one group oppressing another. Why with out the rule of law people will do what they want, which can cause more problems then it solves, just look at the industrial revolution and workers right.

But i digress, Do i feel being racist should be a criminal matter? Yes, do i feel it should go against you on a crb? check probably not. When it comes down to punishment i would feel it a small fine would be adequate.
Now my justification would be that the public good of have a society working as a cohesive group and non fragmented  is better then being able to cruel to someone for there origin.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"Trident serves the function of a 'deterrent'; the theory is that we would never actually *use* Trident unless all hope was lost and the UK was about to be completely destroyed (or had already been destroyed), at which point we would do our best to destroy the country that was about to destroy us. Since we assume no country wants to be destroyed (we assume), as long as the UK goes around telling anyone who will listen that we'll Trident them if they mess with us nobody will *actually* invades us and we never need to use Trident. That's the theory, anyway.

Trident has a few features which make it very well suited for this job:

1) It is effectively un-counterable - the subs only need to surface for a second to fire the warhead, and it travels much faster than any interception system could be scrambled to stop it

2) It is multiply redundant - even if the enemy thinks they know the location of 99% of our subs and fixed-position silos when they invade, unless they *know* they know the location of 100% of the launchers (and can secure them) then it doesn't do them much good

3) It is hugely destructive - no matter how tempting a target Britain becomes, it is not as valuable as keeping all your own citizens and cities intact

4) It will remain destructive into the concievable future - unless we discover a cure for 'death by atomic bomb' we don't need to worry that Russia has better weapons systems than us, because we already have a system that will destroy everything in Russia several times over (incidentally, this is a very good reason to oppose developments in missile shield technology like the 'Iron Dome' - the more likely you are to be able to shoot down a nuke, the more nukes we need to stockpile to maintain an effective deterrent, so the more unstable to world becomes)

There are a few possible alternatives to Trident. For example, the UK could threaten to release smallpox in the cities of the enemy using special sleeper agents. This is probably un-counterable and highly redundant, but is plausibly not destructive enough or scalable enough to serve the same purpose (it also has another negative effect that it would start a pandemic, and affect our allies too). America might be able to crash world financial markets or bring down the internet / GPS systems because of existing infrastructure, but it seems unlikely this capability would persist into a time when America was seriously faced with a land invasion, and anyway isn't a capability the Brits could plausibly have because it doesn't have the financial clout / electronic infrastructure to pull it off in a meaningful way (although maybe a super-destructive Trojan Horse might be plausible; the problem with this is that we couldn't demonstrate we *had* such a weapon without revealing how the weapon operated, which would lead to it being countered). We could do something like drop an asteroid onto anyone who we would otherwise nuke a la *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*, but this would be way more expensive than maintaining Trident and the only advantage would be that it is *literally* un-counterable by the laws of physics and that there would be no radioactive fallout to affect friendly countries. We could sign defence treaties with other countries so that anyone who invaded us would themselves be invaded by other countries but this isn't a 'credible' threat; when the west failed to intervene in Ukraine it signalled that it was unwilling to risk conflict with a nuclear power to uphold non-nuclear peace treaties, so the UK couldn't rely on allies to defend it with this method when the chips were down.

&gt; The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association will be increased to five, meaning that if the Champions League title holders or the Europa League title holders are from the top three ranked associations (but not both from the same one) **and finish outside the top four of their domestic league**, the fourth-placed team of their association will not be prevented from participating in the tournament. However, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders are from the same top three ranked association and finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association will be moved to the Europa League. *(emphasis added)*

The way I read that is that the 4th place team won't be prevented from CL, thus if the 4th place team is already in the CL by being EL champs, then there is no allowance for the 5th place team to get into the CL.

The only way to get a 5th team into the CL is to have either the CL or EL champ be from the PL but **not** finish in the top 4.

Thus, if either Spurs, Liverpool or Everton win the EL, if they finish 5th or worse, the PL gets 5 spots in the CL. If they win the the EL and finish 4th or higher, only 4 teams get in the CL.

So in your scenario if Liverpool finish 4th, Spurs 5th and Liverpool win the Europa; Spurs do not qualify for the CL. If however Liverpool are 4th and Spurs win the Europa finishing 5th or lower; Spurs are given the extra 5th slot and qualify for CL.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt;The Home Office's response is a bit ridiculous - making no distinction between skunk and regular weed.

The study makes no differentiation either. It is not actually stated in the study what they define as ""skunk"", but it seems that they are basically considering cannabis plant matter as ""skunk"", with the alternative being hash, which they define as being weaker. No measurement of THC/CBD content was done, nor was any mention made of the ratio of THC/CBD/other cannabinoids.

Obviously in actual fact Skunk was a fairly common strain in the 90's, and isn't particularly strong compared to the latest strains coming from Holland/California. The strongest hashes are stronger than any plant matter.

Basically all the study did is question ~400 mentally unwell people, and asked how many smoked cannabis prior to their first incident. They also questioned ~400 control subjects, though again it's not clear what relevance they had to anything.

Seems a decent gig if you can get it! Though it really doesn't push the debate forward or state anything we didn't already know. Obviously cannabis used DOES contribute to schizophrenic incidents in some users, but it's clearly a minority of users, and no attempt was made in this paper to quantify the risk.

According to http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/schizophrenia-statistics/ there are 220000 people diagnosed with schizophrenia in the UK. If this study is correct as 1/4 of those people were triggered by cannabis use, then we're looking at 55000 people. IIRC there are around 1.5 million cannabis users in the UK, so the risk seems small.

Maybe they didn't state this in the report because it's pretty well established at this point that if you want your cannabis study to be well publicized it had better contain negative conclusions about cannabis use. The Home Office definitely would not be commenting on the study if they couldn't use it to trumpet the status quo!

The reason I argue this is that ships can be tracked by satellite, and if ships can be tracked by satellite then the enemy can know exactly what force is needed to knock them offline. The proposal relies on the enemy state being *unwilling* to commit those forces, whereas Trident relies on the state being *unable* to do so. 

That sort of leads into my second point, which is that this system could be defeated by better A2A interception fighters, which are a natural development of existing military technology - it would obsolete itself within, say, a decade and require another equivalent investment to take us to 2032 (although it does sound like the author thinks that this is a worthwhile cost because you are also getting improved conventional force projection at the same time)

I agree completely that having a discussion about what price we're willing to pay for a 'gold standard' solution is sensible, but I personally think the importance of the system being un-counterable in principle rather than by weight of numbers is very important to the deterrent function; it is worth far more than the simple capacity to deliver a nuclear bomb",null,0,null,1424099860,null,0,false,0,con3eem,null,t3_2w2ni0,null,t1_con3eem,null,t1_con2z1s,null,null,null,1424620101,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

  For my application, it was a  copy of my passport, and my NI number, not sure what cogs they whirr that through at the FCA.  
   
  *I think if it's a serious thing that needs mentioned that you 'creatively forget to mention' you will probably find yourself temporarily blacklisted. That be unfit and improper by definition.  
  
  Perhaps an anonymous phonecall to the relevant governing body for clarification in your situation is in order?

      * whether the candidate has been open and honest with the regulator and disclosed all relevant matters;
      * the seriousness of the issue and the relevance to the specific role applied for;
      * the passage of time since the incident occurred; and
      * whether the issue relates to an isolated incident or whether there is a pattern of adverse behaviour.  
  
&gt;Clearly, this is not an exhaustive list that the FCA will consider as each application will be treated on its own merits.  
    
  I would make avenues towards getting your individual situation clarified.

Pjanic isn't leaving unless he wants to, and even if he does want to, he won't be coming to Liverpool. And we won't pay that kind of money.

Nainngolan would be a good addition, I don't know if he'll want to leave Roma but he too could probably go straight to a more regular CL club if he were to leave. Also, we won't pay that kind of money for him.

We were reportedly interested in Keita Balde last summer, but he's had a so-so season since and his price hasn't dropped so I doubt we have any realistic desire to sign him right now. 

That's just humouring the rumours, though. Rodgers was in Italy on vacation. If he spoke to a couple agents, they would likely have been about young players. Dude can't just go to Roma anymore.

It's worth investigating mortgage rates at this stage, and making the first enquiries to obtain the DIP - most banks will do this online or you can approach a mortgage broker (the estate agents will probably have one who they will be happy to recommend, but it is by no means mandatory to user theirs).

A DIP will simply look at your income and outgoings, deposit level and borrowing amount, and say that you could probably borrow £x (subject to underwriting).

The rule of thumb is to expect purchase costs of ~5% of the property value. This is probably an overestimate in your case, but you  have to consider conveyancing, valuations and mortgage fees.

Conveyancers may offer a fixed-price deal (with caveats). For the purchase of my first house I think the conveyancers cost ~ £400 (but this was for a new-build where they had acted throughout and had most of the answers already).

Depending on the age of the house you will probably want a more in-depth survey than just the standard valuation (which is often ~£200). A ""homebuyers report"" (£400-£700) takes a more in-depth look with a particular focus on potential issues (damp, electrical wiring) and a full structural survey (often £1,000+) means you have something to fall back on if the house turns out to be structurally unsound.

Arrangement fees for mortgages can cost anywhere from £200 to £2,000 - most banks will say you can ""capitalise"" these onto the mortgage (add it to the amount), but if this extra loan takes you over the LTV limits you will have to shell out more deposit - net result is often the same if you're borrowing the maximum (e.g. 90% on a 90% rate, 80% on an 80% rate).

&gt; Any amount over your Lifetime Allowance that you take as a regular retirement income – for instance by buying an annuity – attracts a Lifetime Allowance charge of 25%. This is on top of any tax payable on the income in the usual way.

I don't really understand why the Telegraph has published this article. It's based on the fact the tax rates/ allowances will not change to inflation. In reality the lifetime allowance has changed 7/9 of the past tax years. It was going up under Labour, then dropped back from £1.75m to £1.25m under Conservative. I can't imagine it would stay this low considering the annuity rates are just going to gradually drop further as people live longer (speculation on my part). I think its probably to do with Lib Dems proposal to drop the lifetime allowance further to £1m - possibly trying to show that it doesn't just hit the wealthy? 

Also you have to remember the 25%/55% lifetime allowance charge is in addition to the normal tax rates (20%/40%/45%), although tax relief would have occurred at source. 

Some other good sources on the matter:

* [FTadviser](http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/02/16/pensions/personal-pensions/lifetime-pension-allowance-threat-to-future-income-2KniVL7syMcEoq7xCU8yKL/article.html) 

&gt; Those taking a lump sum, which more are expected to do from April when pension freedoms come into force, would be hit with a tax charge of 55 per cent on the excess savings. Those taking their fund as regular income would face a lower rate of 25 per cent.

* [Professional adivser](http://www.professionaladviser.com/professional-adviser/news/2395400/lifetime-cap-to-bite-young-savers) - I'm surprised they haven't touched on the reduced tax charge if it was taken as an annuity.

You seem to be ignoring what I'm saying and taking all my posts as independent of each other. History, immutability, the dehumansation of large groups of people-they can't all be treated as single points. 

The Irish are a weird one. As you say there's a fairly recent history of discrimination of the Irish by the English. Even in the last century there would be advertisements that state ""Irish need not apply"" or ""No dogs, No blacks, No Irish"". A similar analogy now would probably be treatment of Polish people and other Eastern European immigrants by certain people in the UK. 

Thanks to race being such a shitty concept with no real definition you could call the abuse of people because of their nationality racism. I'm almost certain it's illegal to discriminate solely on the basis of nationality for instance. 

Should abusing somebody because of their nationality be illegal? Yes, people shouldn't be abused just because they're born in a certain country. It's already illegal to abuse somebody just because of their nationality.

Yeah, being called names sucks, but most adults don't require the police to be involved after they've been called a name, be it racist or otherwise.

My worry is that the F35 will one day be slightly obsolete, which requires either that we spend a huge amount again to upgrade it (say another $16bn, taking us to the same cost as Trident would have been) or just do political wrangling for long enough that the F35 becomes *seriously* obsolete and we no longer have an effective deterrent. With this solution we're gambling on two things:

1) The cost of replacing the system when it becomes obsolete will be less than the cost of Trident - we need to account for the probability it becomes obsolete twice or more during its run and hence cost a lot more, but also that it does not become obsolete at all because military R&amp;D moves away from fighter pilots, which also seems possible. We also need to account for the fact that Trident might become obsolete if missile defence gets good enough, but this seems less likely than either of the two changes to the F35's relative capabilities.

2) That, if obsolete, the government can co-ordinate a response quickly enough to avoid a dangerous gap in our second-strike capability.

I could easily be pursuaded that 1) is a rational gamble now we're not in the Cold War (since you can always ramp up the number of planes if a Cold War situation begins to develop), but you'd have a very hard time convincing me that 2) is a given; each government will have a serious incentive to kick the upgrade down the road because each government will only be looking at a system which is *slightly* more obsolete than the last. If you look at the NHS, for example, no government appears willing to take the expensive / politically unpopular step which are required to prevent a catastrophic collapse in ten or twenty years, so I doubt their ability to do so in the face of a problem which doesn't even exist yet.

Wilshere has a more technical and attacking focused game but hasn't gotten to develop as much due to persistent injury. The difference between him and Hendo is that Wilshere will get goals.

null,false,01two,null,null,null,"The first step in avoiding being ripped off is buying the house at the right price. Remember, the estate agent works for the seller and not for you, so want to try to get the maximum offer from you. 

Make sure you do some research online, look for the sale prices of similar properties, and then factor in the cost of any repairs into your offer. You also want to know the reason the vendors are selling, and how long the house has been on the market i.e. are they holding out for a certain price, or do they need to move quickly.

Then, when you make your offer, emphasise your position (e.g. FTB with DIP, no chain etc) and explain that this is a serious offer and a fair offer based on X, Y and Z. 

In the meantime, check with friends for recommendations on conveyancers/solicitors. It is preferable to use a bricks and mortar office rather than an online service, as solicitors are damn slow unless you chase them daily - for that, you want a person you can call directly and go see, not a faceless call centre and a reference number. A decent local outfit should also be willing to negotiate a fixed fee, but make sure you clarify if it includes the costs of searches etc. ideally, you have them lined up before you make your offer, as you can run a lot of your queries by them first and get some good insight into the local market and any pitfalls before you make the offer.

They can also advise you on making a conditional offer, such as valid for 24 hours and conditional upon the house being removed from the market and no more viewings. This will of course depend on the sellers circumstances. You can also talk to them about an early exchange (so you don't get gazumped) and a delayed completion, which can help if the vendor is in a chain and doesn't want to move for 3 months etc.

Also, I would talk to a good, recommended, independent mortgage broker regarding the available deals. Don't just rely on your bank. I would look to put down a bigger deposit too, to get better rates. Also, they can advise you on whether you should pay a fee for the mortgage or take a fee-free mortgage - at your price point, paying a slightly higher interest rate should work out cheaper than the fee over an initial fixed/discounted rate mortgage, especially if you expect to remortgage in 2 years or so.

Buying a house is one of the biggest investments you will ever make, yet more people spend more time researching a second hand car!

People insult each other all the time. It's part of life. Trying to make it illegal is simply unworkable, pie-in-the-sky idealism! It would be an entirely ineffective deterrent, and I can't see a single good argument for using the police and judiciary to deter people from saying mean things. 

I know that we do, to some extent, live in a country like that already, where people can be arrested for twitter posts. That's moronic too, and something we should be moving away from, not towards.

I mean, it's not like anyone's going to argue that insulting people can be a bit mean sometimes, but when I was growing up we used to learn a phrase: ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."" That didn't stop being true just because people are now, increasingly, overly-sensitive. That's just their own problem for being overly-sensitive. 

Trying to police people's opinions and use of words or insults seems like the definition of a hellish society, in my view. Especially now when racism is at historically low levels. It seems like a reactionary, excessive form of tone policing, except on a national scale and literally enforced by the police. Frightening. Let the punishment fit the crime. Insulting someone shouldn't be a crime. Ever.

null,false,Mrprocrastinaut,eng-sussex,East Sussex,null,"What about it? The proposal stinks. It makes a series of huge assumptions and glosses over the weak points: How is a free-fall deterrent going to remain viable if a country such as Russia makes improvements to its air defence systems to counter such an attack? It's not hard to do, the UK V-Bomber force moved from free-fall deterrent to stand off missiles because of improving Soviet air defences, won't the same happen to a modern program? Why not just go for a combination of F-35 and stand off weapons instead of frigging about with free fall bombs? The only country to maintain a free-fall deterrent as part of its nuclear triad is the United States, and even that plays second fiddle to all other arms in the deterrent (stand off missiles, SLBM's and ICBM's). The whole reason gravity bombs still hang around in the US arsenal is that they act as very specialised bunker busting weapons against contuinity of operations facilities, the proper deterrent capability of the US air arm of their nuclear triad comes from stand off weapons. The French also rely on stand off missiles and SLBM's. Why? Because sending aircraft to penterate enemy airspace and deliver free fall weapons is bloody archaic. And it all hinges on the F-35 being what it's cracked up to be. Its developement has been flawed, grossly expensive, and there are serious doubts that it will live up to the promises it said it would deliver. There are worries about its actual stealth capabilities being as good as promised, so is the RAF going to want to buy around 140 of them for a deterrent role? Do they need 140 aircraft which may be hamstrung by their deterrent role and maybe less able to be used in other roles? Are countries in Europe going to want to play host to UK nuclear weapons and themselves risk becoming targets? Is the Royal Navy going to actually be able to afford to run two queen Elizabeth class carriers, and refit them as cat-and-trap carriers instead of ski-jump, and then frig about with all the other hassle needed for providing deterrence? 

So, in short: bollocks to this proposal. You might as well deliver nuclear weapons to your target of choice by posting them.

&gt; Imagine for one second we did.

But we don't. As you yourself just fucking said. So why ""imagine"" anything? It doesn't change the fucking reality of the situation does it?

&gt; Darren Bent - I can't believe what we did to him.

Again, I don't see how this is Villa's fault. If he can't adapt, then it's a fault in him as a player. His reliance on supply is a shortcoming. I didn't hear people saying ""oh well it makes sense [Rooney/Sturridge/whoever fucking else] isn't scoring goals, he's not getting a decent supply"" because they didn't rely on someone else. Bent did. It's irrelevant how many fucking goals he scored when he signed. It's irrelevant how ""reliable"" he is in front of goal with a good supply. Because right now, he wouldn't have a good supply. That's my entire fucking point. If we haven't got a good supply line, I don't see how Bent being in the squad fixes the goal problem if he needs a good supply line.

Villa didn't do shit to Bent. He simply failed to adapt. Or even show signs that he was trying to adapt. Instead of bitching and moaning to the media, why didn't he fucking work harder and get back into the team? Lambert didn't drop him as soon as he took over ffs. He had a chance, and he failed.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"No, the proposal is awful and you don't understand it. I can see why it might look convincing from a distance, but to those interested in defense matters it reads like it was written by a child with virtually no understanding of nuclear defense. 

The proposal is essentially to scrap trident for an air launched British version of the free-fall B61-12 strategic nuclear bomb. It is also based on switching to the F35C... except there are three major issues with that;

* The carriers we have cannot launch it, without expensive retrospective modifications including the fitting of catapults and traps and an entirely new maintenance infrastructure.

* Neither of the new carriers are built to house nuclear weapons in their armories. So the new deterrent would be limited to land based launches severely limiting its range - or an incredibly expensive redesign of the carriers.

* We are already fully committed (after no less than 2 U-turns) to the F35B. Like it or not, the F35B is what we are going to get and we all just have to accept that. At this late stage in the game it doesn't even really matter, either way the differences are minor technicalities on paper - the reality is we need something and soon else the carriers are expensive paperweights. 

Trident isn't a bomb or a missile. Trident is effectively a submarine launched low-orbit space-ship that can launch 8 separate  individually guided warheads within an area about 40% the worlds surface around the submarine launching it... which is mobile and hidden, and carries up to 12 of the space vehicles, so in essence could drop enough weapons to destroy every major conurbation in a nation as large as Russia or China. This incredibly limited air launched option isn't an ""alternative"", it's replacing a nuclear deterrent with a battlefield strategic nuclear weapon... something we don't need and have moved away from. It's a totally different thing, and the failure of the author to appreciate that demonstrates their limited knowledge in this area.

For the UK an air launched deterrent is a terrible option since with a small airforce of only ~140 jets capable of launching it, of which as few as 10-20 would actually be airworthy at any one time, and probably only 1 actually fueled and ready on standby... A technical failure or preliminary strike could easily render our entire deterrent (essentially 1 or 2 aircraft) moot.",null,0,null,1424104999,null,0,1424105810,0,con5zop,null,t3_2w2ni0,null,t1_con5zop,null,t1_con2jed,null,null,null,1424621380,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

If your offer is accepted they'll handle your mortgage and related insurance applications free of charge.

Email a few solicitors asking for quotes for conveyancing quotes and give them the approximate house value.  Your solicitor will put in notes of interest and offers free of charge.  They only get paid for conveyancing - processing the sale etc.  The will handle all tax and paperwork on the property.

These two people are all you need.  They will do most of the work for you.

&gt;So does Tamiflu work? From the Cochrane analysis – fully public – Tamiflu does not reduce the number of hospitalisations. There wasn't enough data to see if it reduces the number of deaths. It does reduce the number of self-reported, unverified cases of pneumonia, but when you look at the five trials with a detailed diagnostic form for pneumonia, there is no significant benefit. It might help prevent flu symptoms, but not asymptomatic spread, and the evidence here is mixed. It will take a few hours off the duration of your flu symptoms. But all this comes at a significant cost of side-effects. Since percentages are hard to visualise, we can make those numbers more tangible by taking the figures from the Cochrane review, and applying them. For example, if a million people take Tamiflu in a pandemic, 45,000 will experience vomiting, 31,000 will experience headache and 11,000 will have psychiatric side-effects. Remember, though, that those figures all assume we are only giving Tamiflu to a million people: if things kick off, we have stockpiled enough for 80% of the population.

We are fully committed to the B variant. They aren't fitted with nuclear maintenance and storage facilities, and are not planned for 100% at sea cover. Modifying them at this late stage in the game could double the cost of the carriers... and if we were doing it properly we'd need to build at least a 3rd carrier, So essentially we'd be stuck with a land launched system. 

Assuming a carriage could be built for the F35B, we've only placed a preliminary order for 138 jets and that is likely to be cut to as little as 40-60 as the MOD is now looking to a force that is made up primarily of advanced drones like the [Taranis concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Taranis) which are cheaper and safer. Of those F35B's, few as 10-20 are likely to be in an airworthy state at any given time, and only 1-2 could be kept fueled and ready to scramble at short notice. So our entire deterrent would be just 1 or 2 land based jets subject to easy preliminary strike or technical failure. It would not be a deterrent. What it would be is what the B61-12 is... a strategic nuclear weapon for battlefield use. It's the sort of weapon that would be very good at delaying a Russian advance across east Germany in 1985. It wouldn't be very effective against a rogue state or asymmetrical threat with access to a nuclear weapon. That is why both the US and UK have moved away from those sorts of devices towards Trident.

&gt; Whatever threat emerges I can confidently say that it wont be able to somehow defend against that. 

Actually, no. A threat out of range, over sea, or where a preliminary strike against the deterrent can be carried out could all easily defeat the B61-12 system proposed. The B61 isn't a deterrent, its a strategic device for battlefield use. The point of trident is you don't use on the battlefield... if it works you don't have to use it anywhere.

He threw the ball away, I think Borini got booked for that earlier in the season against Arsenal, so yeah, okay.

&gt;Where's the reasoning in that? You've said nothing to his footballing abilities besides for saying he's inconsistent. This is where I start thinking you don't know enough about football to form an opinion of your own, and stop taking you seriously.

You're welcome to think that. I think he's much harder to analyse than other players like Lucas, Coutinho and Hendo, which all have a unique role in the team which becomes evident in their contribution. Allen doesn't really have a role in particular, which is evident from him being on the periphery of the squad. Ultimately, the stats don't lie. He hasn't had any outstanding games, and has had maybe 3 or 4 good games this season. Without trying to be rude, he's forgettable. We should be aiming to get a better player and *a better fit of player* to our team. 

I honestly think Allen is the very definition of fat that should be trimmed. He's not a young player now, he's 24, so he should be asserting himself on a particular role in the first team, even if he doesn't play every week. I just don't see what he does for us, he plays DM almost like Hendo does. Compare that to Emre, who does a job for us in a position he would prefer not to play, adapting, and looking comfortable. I don't think Allen ever looks comfortable when we play him.

When I said that Allen had ""apparently had a good game"", I wasn't trying to belittle it. I didn't see the match, I only got to see the highlights. The only thing I remember was a pass to Henderson leading up to the first goal, which made it seem like he was playing as a box-to-box midfielder. That surprised me, so I don't really want to draw any conclusions from that.

And yeah, I agree that BR's opinion is pretty telling. He's had 7 starts in the league this year so he's clearly nothing more than a squad player.",null,0,null,1424105578,null,0,false,0,con6b69,null,t3_2vzapa,null,t1_con6b69,null,t1_con57op,null,null,null,1424621529,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

The big six energy companies control 95% of the market - That doesn't seem very competitive.

&gt; It's the most regulated utility out there. 

I don't see the fact that it's heavily regulated as a positive really, or to be precise it's good that's it's heavily regulated but bad that it needs to be. The fact that the only way the energy, water, and train companies can provide anything like a good service at a reasonable price (not that I think they do) is by having the regulator breathing down their neck (and in the latter two cases the government actually setting prices). This says to me they aren't working as a free market solution. The only reason these are privatised is because of neoliberal ideology that the private sector is always better, which has been proved wrong time and time again (see also attempts to privatise the NHS). We're paying for our energy if 3 ways, firstly the actual cost of producing energy, then adding on a healthy margin for the profits of the energy companies and the 7-figure pay packets of their chief executives. Finally, we're paying to fund the regulators who make sure they don't use their oligopolistic position to screw over their customers and profiteer, which will always be their natural instinct. If the utility companies were nationalised we wouldn't need to pay for the profit margins of the shareholders or for the regulator.

&gt; It's just public opinion (which is sadly sometimes misinformed) that has it tagged as deceitful. I always hear about how energy prices don't track the market price... that's because the big six hedge in the same way and have similar energy cost bases. Traditionally Centrica have changed tariff prices and then the other 5 follow... they are forced to follow in order to remain competitive.

Public opinion is informed by the regulator, Ofgem, and they are repeatedly saying that the market isn't working well, and criticising the energy companies for putting prices up as soon as wholesale prices rise, but only lowering them after considerable delays. Given that you mention it's good how heavily regulated the industry is, surely you also think we should listen to the regulator when they tell us the market isn't working?",null,0,null,1424105970,null,0,false,0,con6j1f,null,t3_2w273a,null,t1_con6j1f,null,t1_con42h5,null,null,null,1424621631,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

I think you'll find when most people see ""Service Charge x%"" on the bill, they read that as a gratuity or tip being built into the bill - which I personally do not like. I don't tip if there's a service charge on the bill, and on occasions when the service has been below par, I've even left cash and declined to pay the service charge, because fuck that. I *want* to tip good service. But I'm not going to be strong-armed into paying a ""service charge"" if the service was shit.

If in fact the management were just inflating the bill by 12.5% and not splitting that with the service staff, I would feel seriously misled, because in paying that service charge I believe I am leaving a 12.5% tip. For management to pocket it is ""Obtaining Goods by Deception"" - literally the definition of Fraud.

That's also why when I pay by card somewhere *without* a service charge and it prompts me to add a tip I select ""No"", and leave a cash tip - I can be reasonably sure that's going into a tips jar.

But pub work was some of the hardest work i did, i was on minimum wage, running round like a headless chicken, doing some of the longest hours ive done.
I would work 12 hour shifts most Saturdays, 8am start. Not only was i alone most of the morning, i also had to serve food and make sure the toilets were kept clean. Usually up until 12 i was there with me and a manager, of which i did the majority of the work. When your standing at a bar, trying to serve 5 to 10 customers only able to pour 2 drinks at most, its extremely annoying. 
You get a lot of ungrateful people questioning why they are waiting. Well your waiting because i can only fill the glass as quick as the tap lets me, im also trying to serve food before it goes cold and keep track of all the orders. 
People working in pubs (i never worked in a bar so i have no say there) are overworked and most defiantly underpaid.  
You are working with some of the hardest customers to work with, how often do you go to work with drunk people? 
You are put under immense pressure and a lot is expected of you. Some people i worked with where doing 60 hour weeks.  

I guess what im saying is that you question why they are miserable faced, but ask yourself, do you actually know what is going on in their life to make them that way?

Do this.

It would be your local authority that took any further action, their response would depend on a variety of things such as what alternatives you had access to, and how much the landlord can evidence they've done to fix things. It's normal to get complaints from members of the public who say their landlord isn't doing anything, but behind the scenes the landlord has been getting quotes, arranging for workmen etc. I'm not saying this is the case, though, but bear it in mind.

What about in art. Is there such a thing as a form of art, or a technique of art, which is intrinsically Feminist? or Marxist? How about Liberal? Technique and the ability to create are independent of political thought or intent. You don't teach a painter feminism - you teach them to paint.

Thanks to investments in the club, we have world class facilities, and have really put an emphasis on developing youth, despite the current lack of homegrown talent within the squad.

If anything, I'd say our future looks quite promising.  Yes, Chelsea have an amazing squad, but we shouldn't necessarily compare ourselves with them at this moment, as the clubs were in completely different situation before each became financial powerhouses.  And, truthfully, I don't really believe they are any better than we are.

We may have trouble attracting top, top talent because these players have hard-ons for historically significant clubs like Barca and Madrid.  Still, many players would love to come to this club, and why not?

Eventually we will be phasing out the older players in our squad who've played a large part in our success, and its a bit sad, but necessary nonetheless.  Look at united, who relied on their senior players for a bit too long before seeking replacements, and now they are in a very difficult transitioning period.

I wouldn't expect a race of aliens to be able to be at every paradox that ever occurs (but, of course, that's just an assumption).

3: I'm not sure if this was actually in the episode, since I've only subjected myself to watching it once, but I would say that the Statue of Liberty was equipped with a perception device, like the Doctor, Jack and Martha use when in hiding from the Master. Therefore, the Statue of Liberty Angel would only be seen if people knew what to look for. (The Statue of Liberty isn't made of stone, though. But, you know, whatever).

2: River does meet all the Doctors, though it is only off screen (I believe it's in the Eternity Clock game) and River uses a memory wipe lipstick, IIRC, to make them forget about her. Which is a cop-out if I ever saw one but there you go. 
As for knowing the Doctor's name, we're never shown that either, though she does say somewhere that she just pestered the Doctor until he said (which is so stupid I just assumed she was joking). 

1: Jenny did have two hearts, and she was born from cloning the Doctor, but it is never specified if she can regenerate. She is shot and she dies, and she stays dead for a while before she is resurrected. If she had regenerated, she would have changed appearance and personality. But she didn't. So you could argue that what brought her back to life was the Source. 
As for if the Doctor has any interest in her, as far as he is aware, she is dead. He doesn't know if she is alive so he doesn't know he could find her.

Immediately start a diary, writing down exact times, duration, type of noise, any swear words and where in your house it can be heard. Enviromental Health will ask you to do this so starting it now will save time.

Secondly, approach your neighbours about the noise. They may not realise the impact it is having, and if speaking to them works, it will save you a lot of effort in the long run.

If speaking to them doesn't work, get the contact details of their landlord and make a complaint. Hopefully the neighbours will be given a warning, and potentially evicted if their behaviour continues (this depends on how responsible the landlord is...I've experienced plenty of uncooperative landlords who only act when faced with fines). Also speak to the house on the other side of your neighbours and ask if they have any noise issues. If they are also being affected, get them to take the same action as you (enviro health, landlord etc). More complaints means more evidence.

If they are swearing and this offends you, or they become aggressive/threatening when you confront them about the noise (or as others have said, you have welfare concerns for the kids), contact police on 101 (provided it's not an emergency of course). Depending on your exact circumstances and their assessment of the situation, they might become involved. Your local PCSO would most likely handle the complaints (again, every complaint is evidence and so reporting every instance is vital). The police can liaise with other agencies (including the landlord) and if need be can impose certain orders to combat anti social behaviour (such as community protection notices). However, these need strong evidence which means the process can be long winded.

Essentially, if the noise is the only issue with no other components, only Environmental Health have the powers to deal with it. They can install sound equipment in your home which you turn on only to capture the noise. These recordings are analysed and can lead to further action if they show unacceptable noise. Sometimes houses just aren't well sound-proofed, and if the noise doesn't meet EH's criteria (eg not loud enough), your only option would be to sound-proof your house as best you can (there are some great suggestions from other here).

As for the parking, as long as there are no parking restrictions, they can park where ever and however they like, as long as it's not causing an obstruction. If they're parking on yellow lines/in disabled bays with no blue badge (or misusing the badge), contact the council/parking enforcement. If they're parked on a junction (and it's potentially dangerous), on the pavement (and a wheelchair or pushchair can't also fit on the pavement), or casing an obstruction in the road (so that a fire engine can't pass), call 101.",null,0,null,1424109154,null,0,false,0,con8bat,null,t3_2w2ffd,null,t1_con8bat,null,t3_2w2ffd,null,null,null,1424622464,null,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

Most colleges offer their own reasonably priced (relatively speaking) term-time accommodation for at least one year, though some offer it for the duration of the whole course. 

This would mean that if my figures are correct, for their rent and living costs, the poorest students (&lt;£16,000 household income) could access £6,687 per year (£7,687 in the first year) just in grants, or £12,427 in total including government loans. Of course one issue with bursaries and loans is that the thresholds make it difficult for people whose parent/s earn too much to qualify but too little to support the student, but still, even students from households earning up to £25,000 would be able to access more than £10,000 per year in maintenance support if they went to Oxford.",null,0,null,1424109545,null,0,1424152273,0,con8jb4,null,t3_2w2k80,null,t1_con8jb4,null,t1_con7tkw,null,null,null,1424622567,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

As for arcs, there's nothing really specific to cancer or anything specifically about getting over diseases like that. There are, however, episodes kind of on point that I think would help, maybe, or at least give you something to think about how Doctor Who deals with medical/health issues:

1) Vincent and The Doctor (Season 5 Episode 10) - This deals with Vincent Van Gogh and the mental issues you he had (Bi-polar &amp; depression)

2) New Earth (Season 2 Episode 2) - It deals with a group of medical scientists who deal with diseases through brute force, while its not exactly what you're looking for I think it comes close.

As for what the community can do, if she's able to get out, take her to a con. I don't know where you are but a few places have Doctor Who specific cons, often with cast members who show up. I know of Chicago TARDIS in Chicago (in November), but that's about it. You could also look around for someone local to you who owns a TARDIS or cosplays the Doctor well and have them visit.

null,false,micru,null,null,null,"To be honest, I kind of disagree with the guy who said to not bother applying directly and go for agencies. You can still go for them, any job ad is a chance. However, you've probably seen job ads on sites like indeed.co.uk already, and if you have, you would have noticed that ads posted by recruitment agencies are dumbed down and shortened to absolute minimum. You don't even get to find out the company name, as it typically says 'My client, a leader in &lt;market&gt; is looking for'. I am just expressing my personal opinion, but I think it's not enough information to make a meaningful application.


I am basically in the same situation as you, and what I am starting to believe more and more is that all this career advice is a crock of shit. My uni career advisers preached that a resume MUST be 2 pages. They also said that cover letters should be very brief. And then I get a call from an experienced recruiter, who gives me super positive feedback on my 1-page CV and 1-page cover letter. I suppose what it comes down to in the end is that you should include as much information as you feel necessary, but keep it as concise as possible, without any 'hire me pls, I'm very smart' fluff.

When I am writing my cover letters, I am trying to keep in mind that famous situation-task-action-result framework, and using that to match the skills, academic subject choices and experiences I had to: the job description, the company values, the career path that the role offers, the purpose of the role (which business challenges it is trying to solve and how it fits in within the company). When I research a company, my top 2 favourite things to do are reading the annual statement (don't have to understand the financials, just all the other stuff) and reviews on glassdoor.com. Typically, the things I look out for are: how the company and/or its products performed in certain markets, the company's strategic plans, general market overview, what risk factors it is facing/anticipating in its business environment. There may also be some corporate responsibility/charity projects mentioned that you could relate to. Obviously you can't include a lot of that in the cover letter due to length restrictions, but 2-3 sentences or a few key phrases here and there can be enough to demonstrate that you researched the company and understand the challenges it is facing. This type of research is also useful going forward, for an often unexpected short phone interview.

Any other unique skills, such as language skills, are pretty nice to mention as well, IMO. If you are a foreigner, and a company does business/projects in your home country, I think it's pretty useful to mention - shows you've done some research. I am applying to entry level/graduate roles, and my letters are usually around 500-550 words. If some retards from HR don't have the attention span to read that - then you probably are better off not working there anyway. If I write anything shorter - I feel like I am repeating my CV, and just made the recruiter read an extra 300-350 words with no added value. But it may just be my personal thing - as you can see from my replies, I like to express myself. :-) Perhaps the best thing to do, then, is this. If you are applying through agencies - keep it short. If you are applying directly - be more elaborate.

Also, just wanted to quickly note that I would not be put off by such diverse roles like that Met Office vacancy. They say you need a proven interest in weather. Perhaps your home country has a unique climate. Perhaps you are closely following climate change. It may not always work, but I think researching vacancies and companies in the following way, and making it personal, can work. For example, I recently applied to a job role that is similar to my dad's, where he worked for over 20 years, so I was able to demonstrate that personal connection I had to the role, explaining what I learned to like about the job watching my father do it. It doesn't even always have to be 100% true, as long as you think it through and don't stretch it too far.


I wish you best of luck with your applications, hope you find a fantastic job. Don't get demoralised, and keep your chin up! If you keep moving in the direction of the desired destination, it's just a matter of time until you reach it. And nobody is rushing you.

null,false,MyWifesABobcat,cnty-expat,American Expat,null,"&gt; We have a sensible minimum wage, the USA doesn't.

American here. It's actually getting even *more* annoying as a consumer now, because every state has it's own minimum wage when it comes to *tipped* wages (it's written into the law that way). 

Basically, federal law says the states can have whatever minimum they want but the wage + tips must equal the federal minimum.

Because of this, tipping is a normal thing in the US. The problem is that now you have states with a really high minimum wage (for example, California) who don't need/don't operate under tips. They're already making more than the federal minimum of around $8 an hour (for example, california has a $9 an hour and connecticut $10.10 per hour. For comparison, the UK equivalent for 21+ of 6.50 GBP is $9.98 an hour in dollars)

It makes it awkward. If im in Idaho where the server makes $2.35 an hour plus tips, I'm going to tip if they do their job well. If i'm in California where they're making $9 an hour, I feel way less inclined to tip since they're making their $$, but the culture is to tip, so not tipping is seen by most as somewhat offensive

However, keep in mind that we don't have anything in the US that operates like a proper pub does in terms of food. Even american ""pubs"" generally will not only have someone coming to your table to take your order, but they will bring you all ice water and condiments whether or not you ask for them, which is a lot different than my experience in the UK.

I'll preface by saying I agree with everything you said, so I think the difference comes in perception. 

I understand what you mean that he, as a player, doesn't bring anything unique to the team. But that in itself is unique. He's a very balanced player, with a high footballing IQ (that could be another argument, but I'm basing that off his aim to keep possession, and the way he judges space both with and without the ball) that is able to adapt to what the manager wants out of a certain role. 

Forgettable isn't bad, there are plenty of footballers who could've been forgettable if you expect a Coutinho or Can out of them. Cliche, but Allen is more of a *team player*. He fits just fine in our side, with the role he has (as a squad rotation player). By better *fit* of player, it sounds like you just mean a better individual player. Allen's the type of player that if you don't remember much of his performance in a match, it's usually a good thing- just like with defenders. 

He doesn't need to ""assert"" himself anywhere. Instead of him changing to better fit the team (however that may be), people should realize that that's just the type of player he is, and it works. He's not gonna be a world beater anywhere, but he's the perfect squad player. 

I took you saying ""apparently"" as if you saw the match but didn't think the same of him as others did. He did play well, providing a similar role as one I described above, also with 2 key passes, 1 of which was the goal as you mentioned, and another leading to the shot Lallana should've/could've put away in the 1st half.

All that said, I'm not trying to overhype him at all. When I said I agree with BR, I meant it just as you do. Afterall, everyone needs a little bit of fat.

Bond yields are based on the chance of a country not being able to pay back that particular bond. Austerity then should primarily positively impact long term bonds (if it stunts short term growth it might even adversely affect short term rates).

That's what you see in a country like Italy, where at the height of the crisis investors perceived a real risk that Italy would not be able to pay back its bonds. Austerity and the ESM have reduced that risk greatly, and bond yields are now significantly lower than 
pre-crisis.

UK 10 Y bonds on the other hand have been steadily down throughout three successive Labor governments, and then fell steeply at the height of the crisis, as it was correctly perceived that there was basically no chance of the UK defaulting.

Let me reiterate this: 10 Y bonds for UK, Germany, etc... fell during the crisis. People whoes job it is to assess the riskiness of debt felt that at all times throughout the crisis, these countries had virtually no chance of not being able to service their debt.

You mention Chelsea, they make such good purchases, the polar opposite of us in the transfer market. Oscar £20m, Azpilicueta £7m (!), Zouma for £10m and Matic £20m. They were all done quickly quietly and wrapped up for low prices. 

Frustrating to see those deals and then we spend £42m on Mangala when you compare him to any of those. Not because Mangala is bad, but just because it's such an idiotic fee. What the hell happened there? Benatia went for less than 1/3 the price. 

Just little things as well. We spent £6m on Demichelis because even though we signed Pellegrini really really early, Demichelis went out of contract and then signed for free with Atletico. Why couldn't we have picked him up for free a week earlier? 

And why did we fuck up the Isco deal so badly? He was getting ready to sign and we didn't do enough schmoozing with his dad so we lose out on a player who looks like he could be one of the best in his generation. So naïve - surely Txiki was brought in for exactly that kind of thing. 

I was under the impression his hands were tied by FFP, but then, again, Mangala blows that theory out of the water. Hopefully we'll look back at Bony as another good one, too. I think he needs to have a good transfer window in the summer.

A lot of Jews do feel an affinity for Israel though, and it's pretty easy to see why. The state was created in a time of fear of further genocide. There are still people alive today who lived that horror, and a huge proportion of British Jews will have personally known a survivor of the Holocaust. It is still a vital, visceral reality of lived experiences which understandably shapes an approach to the world of needing to know that whatever happens there is a place to which they can flee and be accepted without conditions.

I'm not a fan of Israel. The circumstances of its establishment were in many ways oppressive, and the policy of the state of Israel as it stands now is frequently problematic. Honestly though I struggle to accept the argument that Israel simply should not exist.

Many Jews also take issue with Israeli conduct, foreign and domestic, but the understandable need for a place of safety tends to verge in its favour. They're caught between their principles and their own perceived best interests, and I can't really blame them for that.

Cierzniak is probably up there with Craig Gordon as one of the best shot stoppers in Scotland and undeniably the most attractive football player north of the border. No homo.

....his problem is.... he just keeps coming off his line ALL THE FUCKING TIME. No-one seems to know what his obsession with this practice is all about. Or indeed why United's management are not stopping him from doing it. If I were to grab a screenshot of every goal he has let in this season I bet a good 75% of them will see him standing helpless outside the six yard box looking back with a constipated, agony filled face.

Our alternatives to him include a young Polish guy who apparently isn't ready/good enough to step up, a young German keeper who I am told is similarly shite and maybe one or two young Scots who are loaned out to other clubs.

The thing is - Cierzniak is an amazing keeper. In my opinion one of our best ever. I don't think that getting a new keeper is the best solution. I think that if the management drilled it into him that he should STAY ON HIS LINE we might ship less goals immediately.

However I don't think they are going to do that, so getting a new keeper in the summer is now unfortunately a must.

Let's face it Sam's tenure is untenable and his contract will not be renewed and we will have someone new in August. Part of that is Sam's fault he has been obnoxious, slow to change, and incredibly frustrating at times, but part of that blame falls on the fans. A whole bunch of us never truly got on his side early on in the season they were just giving him enough rope to hang himself with.

Because the government needs to cater for everybody, in order to make sure that the elderly have enough to get by on they means test some top up benefits. That does help the poorest of pensioners.

However what it also does is mean that someone on a modest wage  - let's say equivalent of £20K now, could very easily lose all of their pension in comparison to someone who doesn't contribute because of means testing.

The introduction of opt-out mandatory pensions means that more people will be in the position where they pay into a pension and get no effective benefit. However without the government doing something like this people wouldn't have a pension.

The long and the short of it, as usual, is don't be poor - and with social mobility the way it is that pretty much boils down to the best advice being - Have rich parents.

Depends on where in California. The cost of living in parts of California is significantly less than in others.

Living in Fresno is nowhere near as expensive as living in San Diego, but the wages are the same.

And It really is sort of random across states; the entire point of having states is so that people in whatever state they wanted to live in could come up with the laws they wanted. 

$2.35 in Idaho to $9 in California does not mean California is 4x more expensive to live in, it just means that Idaho has chosen to keep the minimum wage lower.

No you are quite right, it is a side issues to the one we are discussing, but it does I hope frame why the policy has been enacted or rather reinforced at this time. 

&gt;It's especially not an argument for not focusing on policies that achieve both, like higher marginal top tax rates, wealth taxes and taxing rents (in the economic sense).

Neither party is seriously tackling that, tax rises are seen as a taboo subject. Although most agree that they will happen and that VAT appears to be the best option.

&gt;If debt is the big driver of political decisions tax breaks should not have happened. And Cameron has promised more tax cuts down the road.

In my opinion, the problem with *In The Flesh* was the universe writing. It picked the *worst* possible set of De-Facto Standard Zombie Laws^® (traditional supernatural dawn-of-the-dead style) which conflicted horribly with the largely trying-to-be-realistic  'we cured the zombies with SCIENCE!' plotline. The *kinda* antagonists felt incredibly poorly justified, and it was very hard to relate to their point of view. The anti-racism message was heavy handed, and really didn't fit the genre.

'I Survived The Zombie Apocalypse' is a great example of something that would have sounded *incredible* in the producer's pitch to the studios. Two hugely popular formats combined into one.  In practice, it's absolute trash. Zombie movies are popular as their well-established rules allow the focus to be on the human characters and how they cope. It's a completely redundent thing to add to a reality show which already does the exact same thing. Instead you end up with what we got - a programme where the contestents don't act at all like they're in a real situation, and the whole thing becomes a farce.

You shouldn't be. There is extreme disagreement on what a safe level of debt is. 

E.g.:

http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/government-debt

&gt; It is important to remember that there is an absence of evidence that governments with their own currencies are too indebted.

Until methodological flaws were found the Reinhart and Rogoff paper was the key evidence on this point, but that can be considered incorrect at least by academic standards now.

Their number was actually 90% of GDP. Any debt below 90% of GDP was found to not be harmful to growth.

So yeah, 40% is an entirely arbitrary line.

You work your whole life, paying tax on your income and every thing you buy. Then, upon your death, the government sees fit to take 40% of the estate above £325,000. £325,000 is not a vast amount of money. Many of you will have parents whose houses are worth more than that.

Imagine your family have lived in a certain house for a number of generations. Lets say that house is worth £725,000 - *again, by no means a mansion - many houses in london are worth more than this*. When they die, you will be faced with a tax bill in excess of £160,000 (plus 40% the rest of the estate).  It is likely you would have to sell the family home in order to pay this tax bill.

The 3-4-3 formation that we have includes a sweeper as the central defender (a formation which was very popular in the 80's). His job is to cover the 2 defenders infront and out of him in Sakho and Can and to win the second aerial duel when our DM (Lucas) doesn't. The back line is perfect for Skrtel because it doesn't expose any of his weaknesses and plays to his strengths. We've barely conceded any goals using this back line, and another great aspect of this back line is that literally anyone can play as the sweeper because it doesn't require as much responsibility as say a normal CB in a standard 4-4-2 formation. That's why Lovren coming back wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world because Skrtel can to a degree play replacing Can (So he can play in midfield) albeit not as good as him in terms of bringing the ball out from the back into midfield (ironically Skrtel and Can have swapped positions in the second half of some games because Skrtel's a better header than Can is and teams do float long balls to Can to play off) and Lovren can play as sweeper. 

It's essentially a diamond formation at the back really:

If you live in a largeish town look for your local bike coop (you might even be able to buy a good cheap bike from them), they'll make sure its roadworthy for free, you'll only pay for parts you might need.

Practice putting pressure on that inside bar while riding around, you'll turn. Start off with very gentle pressure. More pressure on the bar means leaning more. Exploit it to turn quickly and thread your bike around manhole covers, errant pedestrians etc.

Secondly - would British buy John Oliver's ""British stereotype"" that Americans enjoy so much?

Thirdly - the liberal nature of the politics - would *probably* be accepted in Liberal Britain - so I don't think his commentary would be offensive to any of the kids here.

null,false,SleepLoanShark,null,null,null,"My Grandad and Dad died within a few years of each other. So the money I ended up inheriting had been taxed at 40% twice (there was a tiny discount for this but not much). My Dad wasn't wealthy but the house had gone up in value a lot and he done the place up from top to bottom (extension, attic conversion, new roof) The inheritance tax was something like £80,000. Because the house broke the limit every item he owned we had to pay 40% on. 'Oh he owned a shitty camper van worth £2k? Why didn't you say! We want another £800' 

We had to sell the house to pay it as neither me or my sister had £80k lying around when we were in our early 20's. It was horrible to deal with.

To top it off the inland revenue tried to screw us by claiming the house had been undervalued in 1997 so after we'd paid the bill they came knocking for another £20k and wouldn't give us probate until we paid. The valuation they suggested (overruling an official survey from the time) was ridiculous. Something like £70k higher. 

I ended up doing my own research and proved with my solicitor they were screwing us and took legal action. They folded immediately and put their hands up basically saying 'oops your caught us'. And gave us back the money. 

I was executor, I had nobody to help me. And they could've easily got away with it if I hadn't been vigilant. They basically tried to screw over two young adults still coming to terms with their Dads death.

Although UKIP could have increasing chances of getting more power, their incompetent and damaging decisions will go against them as time goes on. It's a rather damming dilemma because no matter what decision gets made there's dissatisfaction... but when it comes to transferring to another voting system, there may be more but it will be temporary. So do you change the system knowing there could be turmoil but better representation in the future... or stay with the current flawed system knowing that proper representation isn't happening and there will always be people not wanting to vote because they know their vote doesn't necessarily represent who they want to vote for.

Steven Moffat has said in an interview that all of the Xmas episode was a dream *except* ""the very last scene"".  This is, of course, useless, since a) does the last scene mean the *very* last scene, where the Doctor and Clara jump into the Tardis; or just the tangerine on the windowsill after they've gone; or the whole ""Old Clara"" scene, or just *part* of the Old Clara scene (or not)?  And b), even if we knew the answer for certain, we still wouldn't know -- for certain -- where the dream sequence *begins*, or c) if the tangerine on the windowsill is real, that (probably) would mean that Santa is not *only* a manifestation of their brains' defense mechanism but *also* (or) a ""real"" being who really put the tangerine there as an answer to the Doctor's comment that he doesn't even know who to thank for his ""second chance"" to make up for the lost 62 yrs of not traveling together.  Thank Santa!

If the dreaming has already begun (at least for the Doctor) after he's left the cafe scene and taken off in the Tardis and the moment we see him dozing at the console and hear Santa knocking, then Dark Water and DIH are dreams.  Danny's (probably) *not* dead, but Young Clara literally doesn't give him a thought before she runs off with the Doctor to resume their adventures -- which seems odd. 

Not to mention the fact that then we have to ""give up"" all the wonderful stuff that happened in those last two episodes as illusions.  I for one and *not* willing to cede that the best scenes from Dark Water never happened; I mean the little lead-up to the volcano scene, with Clara collecting the Tardis keys and the Doctor making a lightning fast counter plan that gets them to the illusory volcano, the confrontation there, and the resolution in which the Doctor says YES I'm furious with you but NO that doesn't affect my love for you, and, since otherwise you will self-combust out of shame and horror at our own behavior, stop sniveling and let's go try to retrieve Dead Danny.  Those three successive scenes are the entire heart of Series 8.  If Moffat et al are willing to erase it all for the sake of a clever opening twist to Series 9, they had damn well better have a spectacularly successful alternate explanation of the end of Series 8 to take its place in the story-line!

Basically I think Moffat wanted a deeper understanding between Clara and the Doctor in Dark Water and a heroic ending for Danny in DIH.  Being Moffat, he *also* wanted a loose enough end-game to leave him lots of wiggle room to do whatever he wants to in Series 9, leaving us these puzzles to play with in the gap between the two series.  But is even he clever enough to have his cake and eat it too?  If Series 9 starts with , ""Yeah, but that was all a shared dream (coffee-shop to tangerine) and now we'll show you what *really* happened"", what really happened will have to be *stupendous* to surpass the events of Dark Water and DIH and Xmas, while still covering at least some of the same ground.  Hell of a gamble.  Can't wait to see, so Moffat wins -- for the time being.  Next autumn, he will have to deliver some satisfying and delightful solutions to these questions.  Better him than me . . . !

I’m hitting a pay wall I’m afraid, however as I state below it is more about the willingness to cut down on debt rather than dismiss it.



&gt;Their number was actually 90% of GDP. Any debt below 90% of GDP was found to not be harmful to growth.

It is not growth that I am worried about. My concern is longer-term fiscal security and the potential of falling into a debt trap like Japan. If governments consistently pass the problem on down the line we could end up in real trouble next time a crisis strikes.


&gt;VAT tax raises again are deeply regressive and counter to consumption.

Arguably not according to several studies, see here [Link](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/report_evaluation_vat.pdf) and [here](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch10_gb2015.pdf).    

They are however the preferred choice of the IFS

“*Of these three taxes, increases to NICs would typically be the most damaging to work incentives (per pound raised), then increases in income tax, with increases in VAT the least damaging. *”


What the IFS has to say on

&gt; Over a lifetime, we would expect richer households to devote a larger share of their resources to goods subject to VAT at the main rate and therefore to lose more from such a VAT increase than poorer households

Isn't it unfair that people's quality of life depends so much on *luck*?

Ideally no person should be richer, happier, and have a better life than another person just because of luck (e.g. their family and inheritance and so on). 

On this view, the inheritance tax is an excellent way of addressing 'inequalities that derive from luck': it takes income from the children of the rich, and gives it (through government services and welfare benefits) to the unlucky (be it the children of the poor, the disabled, etc).

I work for an insurance company and you'd be astonished at the amount of calls we get from people who had their broker set them up on a mortgage protection type of cover for Life, Income Protection or Critical Illness. If you want this stuff added on then go for it but these people have had like £30 - £50 a month come out of their accounts with no idea who it was going to. 

All because the broker said they'd get a quote for them but put it through any way just to get that sweet sweet commission. And the catch is, they can easily sign someone up using an online trust form so the client doesn't even have to sign anything.... I had to cancel at least 6 clients policies today based on that type of circumstance.

Where on earth has anyone said that?

&gt; or playing for a 1-0 win

A 1-0 away win is an excellent result in the Champions League knock out stages. You sound like something who's only been following football for a few years, or bases everything they know about the game on FIFA. Grow up and simmer down.

If we utterly dominate the game and come away with a draw or a narrow margin of victory, I'd be disappointed, but I would take a 1-0 lead into the home leg if offered to me now. Just because PSG aren't in great form right now, and just because we're a better team, does not mean that they are not a top team capable of playing top quality football. Look at how they beat Barca earlier in the season.

For instance, it depends very much on what family one happens to be born into (and partially, on the size of their inheritance). Isn't this unfair? Ideally no person should be richer, happier, and have a better life than another person just because of luck (e.g. their family and inheritance and so on). 

If you take the view that free will does not exist ([which I personally think is where the evidence points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRIcbsRXQ0o)), then 100% of life is luck. Our fates may not be predetermined (due to quantum, which adds a random element), but we are in an endless state of reaction. 

Even if you do not find that convincing, I think it is arguable that meritocracy is not *that* much fairer than a system defined by privilege, given that people have little control over their talents.

Sensi Seeds, who were called The Seed Bank at this time, bred Skunk #1 using diverse genetics from around the world. Central and South American, Afghani, and Thai varieties converged through an intricate selective breeding process that spanned several generations. Finally, the genetic cornerstone of countless cannabis hybrids was born. 

Some notable hybrids are:

 * Lemon Haze

 * Silver Haze

 * Amnesia Haze

 * Bloodskunque

 * Deathskünk

The amount of people who wouldn't even entertain a conversation about their energy but also the amount of people who were quoted 100s of pounds cheaper wouldn't change because they've ""always been with [insert ridiculously overpriced company here] and they've never been any bother"". 

The fact is that you can't expect a market to be competitive if the consumers do not move around for the best price. I was making around 400 calls per day, around 250 of those connected (someone picked up) about 50 of those people hung up the moment they heard 'energy'. So out of 200 people, between 10 and 30 people (depending on the time of year) agreed to be quoted against their current provider AND the rest of the market (and no, believe it or not, we didn't lie about the results, doing so would have resulted in immediate dismissal). I made around 2 transfers per day, as an average seller. 

No matter what the reasons are for people not switching, my opinion is that prices will not be forced down until companies have a reason to, that being consumers moving around every year to year and a half for a better deal. 

**Energy Pro Tips:**

* NEVER buy your energy from your [regional supplier](https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/for-your-home/regional-supplier-map/334231-4-eng-GB/regional-supplier-map.png), if you do you are being ripped off, I guarantee it.

* Never sign up to a variable tariff (where prices fluctuate at the suppliers discretion) unless completely unavoidable. They will go up more than they go down. Look for a fixed tariff (where your prices are guaranteed to stay the same).

* When you sign up for a tariff, make sure you have no exit fees (where you pay a fee for leaving the tariff early). It is worth paying a small amount more for this kind of tariff as prices will go down at some point in your contract term, at which point you can jump to another fixed tariff without paying any money to do so.

* Remember fixed tariffs fix your unit rate (what you pay per unit of energy you use) and your standing charge (a sort of maintenance fee for the lines and pipes charged daily), not your monthly or quarterly bills. 

* When changing energy companies, you will have a 14 day cooling off period from the day of the sale unless stated otherwise (you will always have some sort of cooling off period however). Use this time to check everything you've been told over the phone is true in your contract. If not, you can cancel your contract before the transfer begins.

*If anyone has any questions regarding their energy bills or their energy in general feel free to PM me for any advise and I'll try my best. I no longer work for EDF so I'm completely impartial.*",null,0,null,1424126087,null,0,false,0,coni9rz,null,t3_2w273a,null,t1_coni9rz,null,t3_2w273a,null,null,null,1424627131,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

A working class-middle class family will work hard and have to spend most or all of their money if they want food, heat, ect. Because they normally spend most the money they make it's always generating tax that spent on stuff that makes everyone's lives better like hospitals, schools, roads, police. 

However rich people tend to spent their money very differently this is in part due (I think) to their ability to hire accountants and lawyers that anrt affordable to most people, who know where their money will be taxed the least. This leads to a pooling of money. That pooling by its self should be a problem but it isn't being spent/invested back into the country. So there's less money circulating for other people to use.

Inheritance tax is an attempt redirect funds from a place it might stagnate.

Traditionally I believe the right and left wing parties disagree on weather it's better to have a big slice of a smaller economic pie or a thin slice of a really big one. Both arguments have merit but in these days of massive multinational interests it's more complex then ever before.

I don't have any qualifications in economics, If i'm being honest I barely passed maths GCSE so If someone who knows more about national and/or international economics that is able to correct me or expand on it I would love to hear from them.

If you're lucky enough to get your mortgage approved as a new product is about to come out, you might end up with a slightly longer fixed period before the rate goes up.

First, yeah, actually, you're going to have to talk to them.  Pick a time when they're shouty, but not angry-shouty (I had neighbours who would shout about everything, so there were times we knew we could go over and say ""Hey, you're being a bit loud."").  Or do the kids cry late at night?  You can go over in the morning and say ""Hey, um, could you keep it down at night?  We need to sleep.""

Then get in touch with the council.  They'll make you keep a diary, and they'll send a letter.  If they're an end-terrace and you're a mid-terrace, they'll know it's you, but if you've already tried talking to them, not much else you can do with them.

You can track down their landlord, but don't complain to them only. Just say ""So you know, we're filing a complaint with the council against your tenants for noise issues.""

And, finally, if you hear the kids crying at odd hours for more than the usual kids-crying, call the police.  Do it on 101, because they'll come over and just check on them, rather than 999, when they'll hustle over.

We did call 999 on our neighbours a few times, though.  When it was the two junkies having a screaming match on Christmas Day, it was when he tried to come into our house rather than his next door. And when it was the local wannabe gangsters having a wild party, there were people screaming they were going to kill each other.  And when it was the family that screamed at each other like they were all 13-year-old girls, it was because the three-year-old daughter was screaming at the top of her lungs at 1am and we weren't sure if she had been left entirely alone or if her family was dead or what-the-fuck-ever.

Right now, we have new neighbours. And they're *so* quiet! Oh my God, please please **please** stay that way.

Not sure what else you want. I'm assuming a primer on how companies and governments raise money would be a bit condescending. There's no single blog that made me understand the borrowing requirements of capital intensive operations and projects.

If you need proof of the size of the issue I could link you to an IoD study that puts the 2010-2020 energy investment requirement at £300 billion or a gov.uk report that indicates a requirement for £110 billion private sector investment.

I hope you see the game here. In theory the govt can raise 110 billion cheaper than private companies (HM govt has a better credit rating). However that would making choices between that and hospital beds/higher taxes. All the parties would prefer the money was raised privately.

EDIT: I said by a ""few"" i meant 2 or more.



&gt; A 1-0 away win is an excellent result in the Champions League knock out stages.

sums you up. for someone who says that i havent followed football for long you dont realise how risky playing for a 1-0 win is. if you sit back and rest on a 1 goal lead youre welcoming attacks and them to score. it happened against 10 man city and utd ffs. if you've been watching football then you would know that as its only happened this season. how is a 2 goal lead win a ""big margin"" victory? They can play well so can we, if they have 4 key players out then you kill them when you have the chance. going against that team purposely seeking for a draw is stupid. its not arrogant to want to win and give breathing room when you have a good chance. its pathetic of ""fans"" to be happy with such mediocrity. if it hasnt been for late goal winners in the last few years then we would have lost matches where it all rested on doing something at home. Every goal they score against us at home will count as 2 if we dont win, do you know how champions league aggregate works? Obviously not..... We play for the draw or go for a 1-0 win if they score 1 or 2 when we're home  then we're fucked thats it.

I'm all in favour of bringing him in for say Coutinho or Lucas in the last 10 mins when we're winning 2-0, for example, to let him and us fans enjoy the occasion. But he should not be starting. He could well have the game of his life should we get into the final, but we cannot predict with certainty that he will, and we cannot be willing to make that risk when there is a starting 11 out there that is scoring goals and not conceding much.

Indeed, *any* successful system that employs high fullbacks (and Rose is arguably the most cavalier in the league) will require central midfielders willing to spend a lot of energy covering sideline-to-sideline.

Anyway, I'm not sold on the implication that Mason's high-mileage is down to ill-disciplined pressing, rather than the notion that he is really the only box-to-box player in the team.  He's not just a tackling passer; he's also willing to run to the striker and beyond (best example being that chance at the end of the United game), which was one of the reasons he came into the team to start with.

'Genetic/IQ' luck is just as undeserved and morally arbitrary as 'parental/inheritance' luck. They are both good reasons to redistribute wealth from the fortunate to the less fortunate; the lucky to the unlucky.

But if you equalise wages then you lose incentives to work hard and get good jobs, and of course that is catastrophic for the economy, so everybody will be worse off.  It's also unfair because you do want people who put in more effort to be rewarded proportionately (presuming we account for luck).

So progressive income and inheritance taxes (and the like) are much better ways to achieve fairness than paying everybody the same salary.

You can definitely support the former while rejecting the latter.

Where you won't get persecuted. Where you're not a second-class citizen. Where your culture is the dominant culture and you don't have to hide or apologise for who you are. 

Until the formation of Israel, Jews never had that. And as much as we have progressed in recent centuries, there is barely a country on Earth that hasn't experienced widespread anti-semitism and persecution in its history. Probably the nearest Jews got to ""safety"" was in Europe 100 years ago. Jews across Europe were completely integrated into society, were successful and happy and then the Holocaust came and all the Jews in Europe were rounded up and most of them were killed. And then after the formation of Israel, most of the Jews in the middle east, who had lived there peacefully for centuries, were either bullied out of their countries by violence or had their property confiscated and were expelled. This is all within living memory. 

Personally, I'm British and would never want to live in Israel, but I completely understand why lots of Jews prefer to take their chances in Israel - a country where they are in charge - even though it's in an unstable region. That doesn't mean I agree with all of Israel's actions, its relationship with the Palestinians or the current government, but I do understand why so many Jews want to live there.",null,0,null,1424129443,null,0,false,0,conk4hl,null,t3_2w3co0,null,t1_conk4hl,null,t1_cona9ma,null,null,null,1424628065,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

null,false,angelkimne,null,null,null,"&gt;If you take the view that free will does not exist (which I personally think is where the evidence points
), then 100% of life is luck. Our fates may not be predetermined (due to quantum, which adds a random element), but we are in an endless state of reaction. 

I agree, it is plausible that *everything* comes down to 'luck'. And if so, we obviously can't hope to neutralise the impact of luck on the quality of a persons life: that would mean equalising everybody's quality of life completely. Because if there is any inequality, it will be attributable to 'luck', even if that 'luck' is somebody choosing to work harder despite coming from a less advantaged background (for we can start to attribute that effort to their genes, parents, and so on). So the whole egalitarian project begins to look a little futile, and perhaps undesirable.

But, if you take a few steps backwards, you can still observe the obviously unfair impact of the more obvious elements of 'luck' and try to address them: you can ensure that state education for the poorest is very good, you can provide lots of services for the disabled, you can provide healthcare to the poor, you can you can raise money for these things by taxing the lucky (those blessed with good genes, parents, education, etc).

I still think it's worth trying to mitigate the impact of luck, even if we can't neutralise its effects completely (since it is all pervasive and determines everything). Society, in this way, can become fairer. That's why Scandinavian societies are fairer than the USA: the quality of peoples' lives is much less pre-determined by luck.

&gt;Even if you do not find that convincing, I think it is arguable that meritocracy is not that much fairer than a system defined by privilege, given that people have little control over their talents. It is also hard to see why all the arguments in favour of levelling the field financially should not just as easily apply to levelling the field in terms of talent. Why should a clever child have more success than a stupid one, given a significant proportion of intelligence is luck?

Again, the luck of 'talent' is just as undeserved and morally arbitrary as 'parental/inheritance' luck. They are both good reasons to redistribute wealth from the fortunate to the less fortunate; the lucky to the unlucky. 

I wouldn't deny it.

I don't think it's entirely fair for one person to end up much richer, with a much better life than another just because they won the genetic lottery. We can't and probably shouldn't ""level the field"" entirely but we should try to soften the impact of luck in this instance: which is exactly why somebody 'talented' like Mark Zuckerberg pays alot of tax which goes into government services and benefits for the unlucky.

You tell me if you'd be happy if you were born with severe physical and mental disabilities, then told ""it's perfectly fair that somebody born more intelligent and able than you have a much better life just because of his natural advantages -- he deserves *all* the extra happiness and wealth that he has compared to you!"". Not very fair in my view. :( Again, we should do something to mitigate the impact of luck.",null,0,null,1424130586,null,0,false,0,conkqig,null,t3_2w30c1,null,t1_conkqig,null,t1_coni4f9,null,null,null,1424628350,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Money does not exist as a single abstract transaction. It is a mechanism of circulation of value. It's literally called currency, something that flows. Everytime value is exchanged, it's fair game for the government (provider of services deemed essential by its electing population, like defence...) to recoup the costs of those services through tax, which is, in essence, it's share of the value generated.

We're poorer in real terms than we were when they took office (~10%). 

We owe more money. 

The financial system which got us in this mess (not Labour, actually) is exactly the way it was before the crisis. In fact, they've expanded the ability for people to get in to debt, at the tax payers expense, with 95% home loans! And yet real property price controls still sit pegged to 1992 values! 

They've slashed our defence to the point where our armed forces are in a woeful state. 

They've let billions of pounds of taxes go uncollected. 

They've ripped up support for children, for the disabled, for people who can't find a job (there are fewer jobs than people so it has to be someone!) 

They cut so deep we nearly had a second recession that was *actually the government's fault*. 

And weirdly enough, businesses on average still can't afford to give pay rises that keep up with inflation, so we're still getting poorer year on year. 

So how exactly are you richer now than you were before?

null,false,angelkimne,null,null,null,"I know, there are undeniably a variety of factors that affect whether somebody is wealthy and successful in life, beyond IQ and natural talent.

And yes, one of these factors is personal choice -- the choice to put in more or less effort, and do better things with ones life. These factors, as I said, might justify one person being more succesful than another.

Other factors, are pretty much luck. Genetics, family, neighbourhood, education. These affect how succesful peoples lives are. (For instance, if you had the genes of Einstein, and the family connections and education of David Cameron, and the best parents in the world, you'd be a much happier and succesful person right now: there's no doubt about it). Inequalities resulting purely from these factors -- luck -- don't seem to be that fair. We should try to mitigate them. (For instance, we should give support to disabled people rather than letting them fend for themselves: since it's unfair they should lead massively inferior lives just because of bad luck in the natural lottery).

I am not trying to deny that much inequality might be fair, since it results from people choosing to put in more effort and make better decisions about their lives. I am making a distinction between 'fair inequality', and 'unfair inequality', and suggesting that we should try to mitigate the latter.

&gt;16 Feb 2015 — Chris Atkins - The writer of ""UKIP: The First 100 Days "" is appearing in front of Southwark Crown Court in 2015 on a count of conspiring to cheat the public revenue. He is alleged to have been part of a complex five-year scam to cheat the taxman, along with 12 others, including seven investment bankers.

Why are Channel 4 allowing Tax evaders to write fabricated material for them?

And none of that reasoning strictly applies to inheritance, which seems to create entirely unfair inequality: it's really brute luck how much (or little) you inherit! There's no effort or merit involved in determining that inheritance. Hence it would be fair to tax it more than income.

No, you're saying we shouldn't cry because of the shit supply line. You then seem to suggest that players like ""Rooney and Sturridge and whoever fucking else"" don't need a supply line to bang goals in. I'd happily bet that if you put Bent, Rooney, Sturridge, anyone apart from maybe Suarez, they'd also struggle immensely to score goals.

Like I said, Lambert stumbled on a striker whose biggest strength is to make something out of absolutely nothing. Benteke isn't a team player - his passing and vision is poor, but the way he can pluck a straight ball out is a marvel.

The mistake you're making is thinking a striker isn't affected by the players behind him. It's such a simplistic view. Bent before we ruined him was lethal. He had a particular skill set - one which would pretty much guarantee goals. You say ""yeah yeah he should adapt and bang in goals even if there are 9 other shit players around him doing fuck all"". Which striker apart from Benteke COULD do that, and who would play for Villa? You're in dream land.

Bent was first choice basically up until Benteke joined. He was pretty much ostracised after that, apart from the odd 15 minutes here and there, being serviced by Vlaar pumping long balls at his face.

EDIT - Downvote me all you want, the lottery is not the same as inheritence tax. Sure a rich person could win the lottery, but so could a poor person, being rich doesn't improve your odds (other than buying more tickets). A single ticket for the lottery has the same odds of winning as anyone else.

A society with 0 inheritance tax however can result in families who's children are guaranteed to be rich, compared to others guaranteed to be paying tax and poor. The rich pay 0 tax on their earnings, the poor pay all the tax on theirs. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. The odds of a poor family having a child born into being rich is 0, the rich family having a child being born into being rich is almost guaranteed. That isn't lottery. Not all families have an equal chance.

People are so keen to make sure tax loop holes are cut to stop people paying &lt;5% income tax on stupidly large earnings, yet so happy to just let the rich pass all their earnings down to people so they pay 0?!",null,0,null,1424134902,null,0,1424135758,0,conn14q,null,t3_2w30c1,null,t1_conn14q,null,t1_conk1xt,null,null,null,1424629450,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As for the Government thinking IT is better than past methods, the Government doesn't know what to think (although with IT they seem to see it as a convenient way of channelling public funds into the hands of their friends in the private sector and to hell with the results). That's probably why they've asked the CJC to do a report on it. The CJC seems to think that the current IT infrastructure of the court system is terrible (no surprises there) and is going to collapse soon anyway - probably under the enormous pile of paperwork it requires. So they may as well make radical changes to the way the system works now, and make the most out of modern technologies (""modern"" being code for 20 years old, which is pretty good for the MoJ).

The whole point of the report is that the CJC thinks that IT could make things far better than current methods. Provided it is done carefully.
