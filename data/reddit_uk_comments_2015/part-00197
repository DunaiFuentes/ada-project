I will say one thing about the striker situation though, our 4 strikers got a grand total of 27 starts combined in the league this season. We could have tried two striker formations, but we didn't. We won't ever know whether Balotelli is actually capable because we didn't really try to play to his strengths. In the end, his one season cost us £10m less than Falcao, and we will likely recoup more than half the fee we spent on him when we sell him.

&gt; EU moves to regulate hormone-damaging chemicals linked to cancer and male infertility were shelved following pressure from US trade officials over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership free trade deal, newly released documents show.

&gt; The TTIP is a trade deal being agreed by the EU and US to remove barriers to commerce and promote free trade.

&gt; In a high-level internal note sent to the health commissioner, Tonio Borg, shortly afterwards, his departmental director-general warned that the EU&amp;#039;s endocrines policy &amp;quot;Will have substantial impacts for the economy, agriculture and trade&amp;quot;.

The unions turned town a 16.5%% pay rise offered by the previous (1970-74) Tory government as they knew if they could get Labour to power they could have whatever pay-rises they demanded as they controlled the party and its leaders.

Labour came to power under Harold Wilson and straight away the miners got the 35% pay rise they were demanding. Shortly after they demanded *another* 35% pay rise and they got that too.

...the profitability of the mines then collapsed (it was already extremely poor to start with) and when Thatcher came to power a few years later she said ""fuck it, close them all down"". 

The unions would have made a more gradual closing of the mines impossible. As seen earlier it was impossible to compromise or negotiate with them as they'd simply refuse to cooperate, wait until their puppet government was back in power and get whatever they wanted anyway. As such there was no other option but to close them.

Yes, Thatcher shut down the mines, but she wasn't the reason they had to be shut down. You can blame the unions and union controlled Labour politicians for that. They brought it upon themselves.

On another note, Cuadrado has had no preseason with a championship winning team who would have also suffered from progressing so far in the world cup last summer. Give the man a proper season before throwing out any rumour of him leaving, he provided a spark against Sunderland and will be a fantastic player next season, I am certain. 

Bale is a fantastic player but he does by no means fit Mourinho's system, although he has a fantastic work rate his defence has been a liability this season for Madrid placing too much defensive burden on Carvajal leading to numerous goals conceded. I would love to have him at the club but with the implementation of FFP this transfer seems unlikely, can't say the price Madrid would ask for would justify his services. 

Just my opinion, please don't take any of this as concrete evidence, I see maybe a striker coming in this summer along with the possibility of a defensive players, although I would be more than happy for Bamford, Loftus Cheek and possibly Izzy Brown to compete with squad roles.

&gt; The Government reported that by the beginning of December 2013, 19 out of 23 such petitions had been debated (by the end of March 2014, these figures had reached 22 out of 2767), and that some had “had a direct impact on Government policy”.

[It's not just me saying it's useless.  It's the Head of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpolcon/82/82vw30.htm) (2013)

Regardless of how useful or useless it is, it's closed right now.  Which isn't so much of a problem if it is useless, but is a problem if it isn't.  Would be good to have the choice, anyway.

The new proposed system plans to do away with the 100k signature system.  It's a double edged sword.

It may decide to use thresholds for signatures to trigger certain action, such as putting forward a petition for debate, at its discretion. We expect the Petitions Committee to take the well-established and reasonably well understood existing threshold of 100,000 signatures for a petition to be considered for debate in the House as a starting-point; but there may be occasions when a debate is not appropriate—such as when a debate has already taken place in the House on the subject— and the Petitions Committee may decide that a petition which has not reached that 100,000 threshold is nonetheless worthy of a debate in the House.

The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player - Frazier Campbell for me, yes he scored a few goals but they always seemed to be tap ins that were already going in! Never looked like he fit the system really.

The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player - Joe Ledley. Less forward-thinking than McArthur, less destructive than Jedinak but a crucial part of our system at times.

Goal of the Season - What's been your favourite Palace goal this year? Jedinak against Liverpool!

High Point of the Season - Beating Man City was amazing, but personally the 2-1 win over Spurs at home was great because I'd been at uni for most of the season so  I hadn't seen us win for a while!

Low Point of the Season - Everything under Warnock, and the consecutive losses to West Brom and Hull. Also those two dire 0-0 away draws over the Christmas period at QPR and Villa. QPR might be the worst ground I've ever been to and the Villa game could've been played for a year and no-one would've scored.

The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents - Has to be Liverpool, we just keep beating them and it's never not satisfying.

The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill - Bolasie to win his own award for that bit of skill against Eriksen.

Chairman of the club from 1991, he completely and utterly failed to commercialise the club ala Manchester United. Let's not forget that at the foundation of the Premier League, Liverpool had won the old First Div in 89/90, 87/88, 85/86, 83/84, 82/83, 81/82 and 79/80 (and that was only the last 10 years or so). You can definitely make the argument that at the time, Liverpool was perhaps *the* UK football brand. 

I also don't accept that it was impossible to see the direction the game was moving in, the entire reason for the creation of the Premier League was to breakaway from the Football League and better commercialise and grow revenue. You only need to look at the rise in TV rights money, Premier League achieved £191M for 1992-97, compared with £57M for 1988-1992 for the Football League (originally £44M, I adjusted for inflation to match the 1992 figure for easy comparison). 

Of all his transgressions, the worst (i.e. that with the biggest impact) was then not selling the club to DIC in 2007 and going with Hicks and Gillet instead (possible motivated *only* by a desire to see the club owned by Westerners). It's not as if the phenomena of wealthy owners putting large amounts of their own money into a club was unknown at that point either, Abramovich had been at Chelsea since 2003. 

TL:DR Chairman David Moores failed the club.

The MLS is a mickey-mouse league. Its not even a league. The entire thing is structured like other American sports, where you have a regular season and then the playoffs.

That might work when you have genuine competition in the regular season, but the MLS doesn't. So many teams can get through to the playoffs that the 1st half of the season is just a set of glorified pre-season friendlies. All you need is a nice push at the end of the season, get into the playoffs, and then something resembling proper footy might break out.

Its a bloody shame, as contrary to what many Europeans may think - there are parts of the US which have a genuine passion for the game. The Pacific north-west teams in particular. They have a fantastic atmosphere, and its a crying shame that all they have is this joke of a league.

I'm not American, and this shouldn't be dismissed as an anti-American rant.

The total lack of competitiveness in MLS is one of Klinsman's biggest bugbears. He HATES the way the league is setup, and HATES it when any American player capable of playing in a European league ends up back in the MLS (eg: Dempsey and that ex-manager's son who was playing for Roma - forget his name now). Its also why he had little to no respect for Landon Donovan. Someone like Klinsman, who's been there and done it, knows how little a ""long and memorable career"" in the MLS is worth.

Sweet fuck all.

And what really gets my goat is that just south of the border there is a REAL football league, with REAL teams (they hold their own pretty well in the Copa Libertadores, which IS a prestigious and meaningful competition), who are up for it whenever they play US teams in the CONCACAF Champions League (or whatever they call it). You'd forgive the Mexican teams if they didn't think that competition was worth it.

Yet they do take it seriously. The funny thing is - the MLS teams don't. What a joke. Their one chance to play a proper competition, against real teams, in a full-blooded every-game-counts no-stupid-tepid-friendly-kickabouts competition.

And they all say ""no thanks"".

Its a shame that genuine American footy fans are served up this tripe. They do deserve better. There is genuine passion for the game here. Not everywhere, but in some places, yes!

And its a shame that Stevie has to end his career here. I would have LOVED to see him go to Spain or Italy, where the general pace of the game is more forgiving for those &gt;35 years old. Join a newly-promoted team or some such. Lead in the way only he knows how. On and off the pitch. Keep them in the top league for a couple of years.

That would have been a fitting and glorious swansong to a great career. That would have meant something. (eg: Cambiaso's swansong at Leicester)

Not this.

Sorry.

PS: To underline what some previous posters have already said. The MLS is really setup to be more of a money making franchise organisation. Its McDonalds selling football instead of Big Macs. Clubs (who are we kidding, ""clubs""?, I meant franchises) get a large number of games, every year, with no threat of relegation. Everything has been very well monetized from the get-go. And players get sweet fuck all (you wouldn't be shocked - you would be APPALLED if you learnt how little many players make). Big names are imported from abroad - NOT TO WIN TITLES. Just for their profile. They are paid hugely well (while their teammates and opponents are payed less than crumbs) because the US is a country where advertising is gold. And these great players aren't here for their playing ability. They are here to be advertising billboards. When you scratch away the veneer and look at it, the whole thing makes a mockery of football and sport.

McDonalds isn't a restaurant.

Your claim that atheists don't gather in groups is so easy to disprove that it's not really worth spending time on; whether we use r/atheism, the reason rally, the brights or any other atheist group, it's clear that yes atheists do gather in groups. 

What's equally clear is that you haven't answered the simple question: where are the groups of peaceful, moderate atheists? Since you can't show us any, why should we believe they exist? 

Your attempt to turn the tables on religion is so misguided it's actually funny: it's incredibly easy to provide  examples of moderate, peaceful believers in groups - just about any church or synagogue will do, or you can go back in history to see the believers who invented universities, hospitals and libraries. As for peaceful religious revolutionaries, nothing could be simpler: jesus christ, gandhi and the Buddha are obvious examples.

But that's not really the point is it? We're not talking about religion, we're looking at atheism. So why not sick to the point instead of trying to create these diversions?

Exactly -- he could have had another full season at Southampton before slowly being faded out. We haven't given him as much game time as we would have got at Southampton, and we stopped him going to Villa in January where he would have played more under the guise that he was an important member of the team. 

&gt; we gave him a better wage 

I sincerely doubt that is any motivation for a player like Lambert. He just wants to play, and when the opportunity to join his boyhood team came up, of course he jumped at it. I can't and don't blame him for that. But I do feel sorry that he's joined his boyhood team and warmed the bench for most of the season when, in reality, we haven't had fantastic striking options open to us anyway. 

&gt; very little game time 

To me, even though he was told this, 5-10 minutes at the end of a match that we're losing or comfortably winning isn't proper game time. His whole season here has been one short cameo and now we're talking about selling him? That's disgraceful. I'm sure he loves the 5 minute thrill of stepping out onto Anfield but Rodgers hasn't put enough faith in him as far as I'm concerned.

Then we could play Kondogbia or Yaya next to Fernandinho - and occasionally all three together if we play 1 striker. That way Kodogbia would get settled into the squad easily, we'd keep Yaya and because he wouldn't be so overplayed or exposed defensively we'd see the best of him again. 


But because someone in 2013 failed to see that a box to box midfielder would decline in his 30s and gave him a huge contract, that's not an option.

The only chance of change happening would be if enough franchises join MLS so that you DO have to be slightly better than incompetent to make the playoffs.

And if even more join, so that it becomes impractical to keep them all in 1 division. Once you add promotion and relegation to the mix, you have some semblence of competitiveness.

Once you have competitiveness, than you'll get some owners wanting to pay more, to get better players, because it might make a difference if their employee's actually play good footy or not.

Once some owners start doing this, others will have to follow.

Its a sport. Competition first. Everything else will follow.

MLS is upside down. They have everything organised. Except one.

The actual ""sport"" part.

PS: Its why Klinsman looks for players under any rock, from any continent, before the MLS. And (here's why I don't think your wishes re: Gerrard will work) when he voices it as diplomatically as possible, the sports media over here is generally dumbfounded. ""What do you mean our league isn't any good? Thats impossible. This is America, dammit"". Witness how utterly confused and non-plussed the American sporting media was over Donovan's exclusion from the last WC. Not many got the hint that Donovan never was that good in the first place. They just recounted his MLS stats and automatically assumed that he was a world beater. And when the owners get wind of Klinsman saying anything, they line up to put pressure on him.

1) We can't just stomp our feet and proclaim that we can't get CL football or trophies because we can't financially compete with other teams. The FA Cup is a competition that can be won by anyone, and we proved last season that you don't need ridiculously large wage packets to enter the top 4. The fans asking for at least CL football isn't a ridiculous notion. 

2) I agree with this one -- especially on the internet. When we're after a particular player, everyone's praising them for being the best. When we inevitably miss out on them, it's ok because they're overhyped and wouldn't fit the system anyway. 

3) FFP is being loosened this summer. So the owners could invest more. Will they? I doubt it. But they could. 

4) See 1. If we want world class players, we need either trophies or CL football. another reason why fans push for both. 

8) mutually exclusive arguments. Playing defensive football doesn't guarantee you'll win things any more than playing attacking football does. Mourinho is the master at getting the result that suits his side -- whether that's playing defensive and nicking a goal in the last 10 minutes or counter attacking all game, he changes it depending on the team he's facing.

Some companies claim they will save money as they will be able to trade with Europe without the restrictions the EU imposes, this is obviously nonsensical as the EU won't suddenly accept goods and services below a certain standard. Like Norway and Switzerland, the UK will be forced to obey trade restrictions &amp; will no longer have any ability to influence then. 

Other companies claim they will make up the lost business through international trade. These people are leaving aside that one of the main things countries like China and the US like about the EU is that you negotiate once and then have access to a huge market. I think it's naive to think they will all instantly change back to individual trade deals just because the UK wanted out of the EU - or that if they do, they will be anywhere near as good as the EU deals. 

Finally, many companies will lose skilled employees immediately. Many EU residents will leave the UK of it votes to leave - many might call that a positive, but in my opinion the UK has taken some of the most highly educated and skilled people from all over Europe which has helped the UK to grow, and will inevitably lose some over any exit. That will cause short term pain as huge swathes of knowledge will be lost. 

I truly believe there is zero business case for leaving the EU. Even people from business struggle to justify it from that perspective. Head of JCB just showed his ignorance when he spoke out.

(As a general rule money left in Trust for minors has a fairly onerous tax regime once the eventual beneficiary turns 21). That said, if the trust is ""discretionary"", this may not be the case.

The ""good news"" for your £50k is that currently inflation is running at close to, or below, 0, although that isn't likely to be the case for the long term. 

I would hope the trust is invested in ""real assets"" (i.e. stocks and shares). Trustees have a mandatory obligation to invest the funds appropriately ([guidance from STEP here](http://www.step.org/doing-your-duty)).

All of the reasonably costed S&amp;S ISA platforms are online-only (keeps the costs down). The best place to look for comparisons is somewhere like [Monevator](http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/). If you are taking the £50k from the Trust and investing that, the best choice will be quite different from a regular investment ISA (where the percentage fee brokers tend to look cheapest, at least until you have £25k+).

The investment really needs an aim. This can be general (retirement funds), or more specific (to buy a property in 10 years), but without an aim money tends to be less ""sticky"" (so, for example, in a bad year you're more likely to sell it at a loss).

I strongly recommend you read the [FAQ section on general ideas on investment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment), and consider picking up the[ Tim Hale book, Smarter Investing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Investing-Simpler-Decisions-Financial).

I think there needs to be a change in attitudes towards working hours, it is evidently not the case that more is better.

40% of all French people are atheist. Do you think they all organise their lives around that fact? Why is there no church of atheism in France, bursting at the seams with tens of millions of members? Why isn't there chaos??? 

The equivalent number for the UK, again excluding agnostics, is 25%. Do you think 1/4 of the UK is a member of the ""Brights"" or a subscriber to r/atheism? Have you ever met a ""Bright""?? I haven't. Show me their membership, or the membership stats of all the atheist organisations in Britain, and then explain to me why it didn't equal 25% of the populace. I'd be absolutely amazed if it was 1%. The British Humanist Association is the closest thing to a large established atheist group, their membership according to Wikipedia is around 40,000.

You might see this as a good thing. However, it changes how your thinking patterns, especially in regards of rebellious anti-state thought. 

Now you may even agree with that but in the long run it alters your ability to create and innovate. Look at areas of the globe where they have the death penalty (including U.S. States). Now compare that to areas the don't. What you find is that a mind, unconstrained from the fear of action results in freedom of expression and more importantly freedom of development to further the endeavor of mankind.

This was the point Benjamin Franklin was trying to make when he said those who would sacrifice freedoms for security deserve neither. As a scientist he understood how important it if for a person to live free from the specter of annihilation for his crimes committed or perceived to be committed by the state.

- fail to mention the season before Klopp arrived, Dortmund had finished 13th ( and 9th before that one). Finishing 6th for them was an improvement of 7 whole places.

- From wiki 
&gt; ""During the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, the 81 points accrued by Borussia Dortmund was the greatest points tally ever amassed in Bundesliga history and the 47 points earned in the second half of the season also set a new record. Borussia Dortmund's 25 league wins equalled Bayern Munich's 1972–73 milestone, while their 28-league match unbeaten sequence was the best ever recorded in a single German top-flight season."" 
 
- First ever Domestic Double for Dortmund. 
- Back-to-back titles. 
- A ridiculous run to a final they could've won if it weren't for Bayern and Goetze shadiness. Remind you they were drawn with City, Madrid and Ajax in ""Group of Death"". They didn't lose a single game and topped the group. He beat Jose Mouriho 4-1, enough to get through a semi-final that Jose's job at Mardrid hung on. 

- He's lost many more players than we have, it's frankly hilarious that people use this as comparison point. We've spent a bucket load more and in the last fifteen years have only been forced to sell Torres to a direct rival. Sahin, Kagawa, Lewandowski, Goetze. They have been under the kosh to sell first team players a lot more than we have, plain and simple. 

- Also worth considering is that when Dortmund brought him in he was at the end of a very similar 7-year cycle at Mainz, having brought them up and had success but being relegated and unable to bounce up in the last 2 seasons. So it's not like he's lost his mojo, he's clearly at the end of a cycle.

null,false,lithaborn,null,null,null,"First thing that struck me was wondering what environment a cup of green tea isn't appropriate. You say in replies that you work in clinical science, so is that something to do with clean rooms, or contamination? I'm genuinely curious.

This is going to sound stupid, but when I was in my mid teens, I stumbled upon a very simple meditation routine after reading about pain management and (and this is the stupid bit) making yourself less ticklish. You sit or lie somewhere comfortable. Don't put too much thought into where, just be comfy. On your inward breath, you tense up, breathe in all the tension and tightness, start to shake if it feels right, build it all up. Breathe in slow and deep. Breathe out slowly, too. On your out breath, you let it all go. As you breathe out, feel all the tension and tightness flow out of you and feel yourself sink into the bed, the seat, the floor, whatever. 

As you breathe in and out, tensing and relaxing, be mindful of parts of your body you're focussing on - maybe your back hurts, maybe you feel more tension in the base of your neck, or in your hands, maybe your feet itch...try to feel those negative sensations dissipating through the rest of your body, and as they spread, they lessen until they're not there, or until they're at such a low level you can cope with them without thinking.

I've never looked too much into it, it works for me, and I believe that if something works, don't try and fix it. The technique may have a name, may be well known, I wouldn't know. It's probably unique to me, but again, I wouldn't know. I've taught it to my kids and it certainly helps them with stress and pain management. And ticklishness.

Day to day, you mention in one reply that you think you have self discipline and organisation issues. This is something I'd focus on, if I was in your shoes, especially as you're behind in work and getting nagged.

Lists, a schedule, prioritising, working on the self discipline you need to do one thing to completion, then move on to the next and don't try and keep 15 balls in the air at once, doing each of them piecemeal and never managing to complete any of them.

You say you drink regularly, but don't socialise. This isn't healthy and though you feel it relaxes you, it's probably having a counter-productive effect. 

Again, work on having the discipline to go out and socialise if you're going to drink at all. You'll drink less overall, take your mind off the hook easier and you won't be sitting in your empty house, pissed and stuck in your own head. You'll also find your head clearer for work and organisation.

Please don't feel guilty for taking a break at work. There's plenty of evidence that short, regular breaks increases productivity and staves off burnout and stress. Tell your boss you'll work better for having a 15 minute break to recharge the batteries than slogging away for too long, getting exhausted, becoming less mindful and starting to make mistakes.

Before you go the medication route, there's a lot it seems you can do to naturally switch off and relax. You need to take small steps that you know you can achieve and stop trying to look for a magic bullet that'll work immediately.

i found that working hard is a great way to plow through your workload, which might look good on paper. but it also stresses you the fuck out, as you've clearly experienced.

ive shifted my work style over the years. i take the time to waste the first half hour of the day gossiping over coffee. i sometimes leave early (and sometimes late). it was a hard adjustment. i felt like a slacker at first. but it made work a much more enjoyable place, i get along with colleagues more, have casual conversations with the boss.

i dont think my productivity has dropped because of this. the only mention ive had in performance reviews was that youve ""really come out of your shell"".

Most improved - Danny Rose. When he signed the five year deal in the summer we were all shocked and a little upset

null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"LostInTheTimeVortex   The Izzitmee posts all seem to be just shit stirring because somebody's bored and wants to get everybody arguing.  I thought S8 was a daring departure, presenting the new Doctor in a variety of varying situations so we could get an idea of how *he* would react as opposed to Matt Smith's Doctor, while the new Doctor moved through this series of jewel-boxes discovering the very same thing for himself (as did the new Clara) -- what he is, what he does, what kinds of mistakes he makes, etc.  I thought it was risky, inventive, and great, but I really enjoy stories about characters building and discovering themselves right before your eyes, so plot for me is just a scaffolding to hang character work (and challenging acting tasks) on, not the whole point.  But the break was sudden and radical, and I've run into a number of fans who actually know almost nothing about S8 (having quit after one or two episodes) but who still bitterly complain about how ""awful"" S8 was and how it ""ruined"" everything, blah blah.  A lot of this seems to be a sort of lemming-like hysteria; my hope is that it will die down when we get to S9, and that in the future more sensible re-assessments of S8 will come up for discussion.  Meanwhile, for those actually watched it and didn't like it, don't give up hope -- S9 is coming, and sounds like it will head back into the more familiar groove, for better or for worse.",null,0,null,1432630167,null,0,false,0,crl5oeo,null,t3_3758it,null,t1_crl5oeo,null,t1_crkjofq,null,null,null,1433271395,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

Things I've found to work for me:

Having something else to concentrate on.  Preferably something enjoyable.  I find myself going back to computer games like Kerbal Space Program and Dwarf Fortress which while simple on the surface are actually quite complicated and require focus and concentration.

Keeping fish.  I know it sounds a bit daft but I find just sitting and watching my tanks for half an hour to be really helpful.  The routine of actually looking after them helps as well.  I can spend a couple of hours on a Sunday just changing the water and moving things around in the tanks and there's a surprising amount of research to be done on actually keeping the fish alive and healthy, which is good for switching me out of a stressy mindset.

Stroking my dog.  As you live alone and seem a bit time constrained that might not work for you, but stroking a cat or dog apparently helps to lower blood pressure.

Listening to audio books.  I don't get a lot of time to actually sit down and read, but I can put a dozen audio books on my phone and listen to them in the car/walking to the shops/whilst cooking.  It's pure escapism, but a couple of hours in the kitchen with a good book is my daily chill-out time.

You've got it wrong because it's not about working hard, it's about working smart.

I thoroughly respect your approach as that's exactly what I did for a number of years, burning through 60-70 hour weeks working really hard and eventually spending 12 weeks sick, earning nothing and being pissed upon by everyone else for being inadequate scum. My BP was 180/120, I crashed and had a breakdown. I couldn't even get out of bed. Everyone you know turns on you when you burn out, even family. 

It doesn't help that society promotes this as the ultimate place to be (before the burnout and crash) and judges you accordingly.

Nothing government gives a shit about you. You're a number. That became apparent after spending 8 of the 12 weeks dodgy jobcentre and pointless positions that I had no skills in. I was on a waiting list for NHS councilling. Never turned up.

I managed to get myself back on my feet through taking a basic job (fuck JC, it was easier just calling people) and working my way back up. Not through the ranks, as a I refuse to play that game, not through the cock sucking as I refuse to play that game but sideways. Make yourself indisposable though skill and knowledge and unfireable because they know you're a complete fucking psycho who will burn their business and entire world to the ground in two minutes if they piss you around even once. 

That's the only place you will get any respect. Otherwise you're just a fungible resource. However many times they tell you that you're doing a great job, a bag of shit is there waiting for you tomorrow.

I don't think that's true at all.

I'd say there is usually 2-3 good ones most years (this year was actually a bit weaker in my opinion) but the highest voted for song in Eurovision history is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXwgZL4zx9o) and I think it's a great song.

The winner this year won less because of the good song (although I do think it was very good) and more because of the seriously impressive effects on show.

By assuming nobody else takes it seriously you are somewhat proving my point that the UK sneers at Eurovision. Europe has different music tastes to us, and that is reflected in Eurovision.

It's true that most songs wouldn't break our top 40, but the UK top 40 is a strange beast, and to think that if music doesn't get into our top 40 it isn't worth performing is exceptionally arrogant.

Also the reason why nobody buys Eurovision songs in the UK is because:

1. They have to be original, meaning most of the time, EV is the first time we are hearing it, combined with:

I do all I can to fly mine within the limits of the law, but short of owning one's own land, it is just about impossible given the current legislation.

null,false,PenguinBurrito,lfc99,,null,"Let me tell you a story about another team, a team where the fans were complacent with the teams performances, and never demanded more from the owners. This team may play a different sport, and it's from a different country, but those details don't matter too much.

In 1947, the Chicago Cardinals were crowned champions of the National Football League, and in the same year, the team owner, Charles Bidwell died, leaving the team to his wife and eventually his son.

The rest of Charles Bidwell's family didn't much care for winning championships, they wanted to run the team as a business (sound familiar?).

The Cardinals moved to St. Louis, Missouri and slipped into a state of mediocrity until Charles' son, Bill Bidwell took over. The fans never demanded that Bill invest in the team. They didn't demand that he hire the best coaches. They didn't even demand that the team go after the best players. Of course the fans wanted to win, and they had a couple of good years, but that was about it.

Since Bill Bidwell never had any of these demands from the team's supporters, he ran the team solely to make money. He consistently had one of the lowest wage bills in the league, and routinely brought in players for cheap, and let them go once their salary got too expensive for him - many of which went on to contribute to much better teams (sound familiar yet?). All the while, the owners kept collecting money from the fans who didn't complain too much.

This pathetic state of the team went on for FIFTY NINE YEARS. In 2006, as the management of the team started to transition to Bill Bidwell's son, the ownership finally started going after bigger name players, paying for their higher wages and making the trades necessary to build a team. They also went after a coach that they thought could make a difference, not just keep the team in a state of mediocrity. Finally, after 61 years since their last championship, the Cardinals returned to the Superbowl.

Many, many teams have gone through a rebuilding process like we're in now. It's when the fans stop demanding the best that the ownership get complacent. I don't want to go through 61 years of mediocrity before we get a chance to stand atop the Premier League or the Champions League.",null,0,null,1432631400,null,0,false,0,crl5y3x,null,t3_37awjc,null,t1_crl5y3x,null,t3_37awjc,null,null,null,1433271522,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

You set a daily calorie target and by logging *everything* it compels you to make decisions about what you're going to eat to stay within your calorie budget. Simple things like cutting out the 150 calories latte every morning and swapping a second lunch time ham and cheese sandwich for some carrots and cherry tomatoes adds up to huge number of calories over the course of a week.

Effectively, you need to run a calories deficit to lose weight. You need to run a 3,500 calories deficit to lose a pound. Knocking off 350 calories from what you normally eat will therefore lose you a pound every 10 days.

null,false,satanspanties,null,null,null,"Solely exercising to lose weight has never worked for me, and AFAIK it's not worked for anybody I know either.

The basic advice you're usually given to lose weight is to eat less *and* move more; you need both halves of that advice. What's worked for me is portion control, a more balanced diet and a generally more active lifestyle, in that order. Weigh/measure your food and start paying attention to recommended portion sizes on packaging, eat more fruit and veg and stop drinking calorific drinks like pop and alcohol, and walk or cycle to work and the shops and take the stairs. You may also find it helpful to use a calorie counting app. Even if you only use it for a few weeks, it will make you aware of what you're actually putting into your body; as /u/Timothy_Claypole says, a lot of people end up eating more when they start exercising, which doesn't work as well as you might think. Walking one mile in 20 minutes, for example, uses about the equivalent of one Penguin biscuit.

I'd also say that two pounds in two weeks is not that much. It's a worrying trend, obviously, but it's still only two pounds and nothing to cry about. I would expect it to take several weeks to figure out what works for you. I recommend visiting /r/loseit and/or [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/weight-loss-guide/Pages/weight-loss-guide.aspx) to get an idea of what resources are available and what you can expect, though I guarantee that both of those places will tell you exercise alone is not enough.

They treat you like cattle and were always bringing in extra rules to try and catch you out so you'd end up paying more. I've actually seen people break down in tears at their checkin desks. 
 
I know several bands that will refuse the gig rather than fly with them. 

One notable event I remember was an old woman and her husband flying to their daughters wedding in Poland and Ryanair wanted a lot of extra money which the couple obviously didn't have  ( something to do with a last minute change in baggage allowance that Ryanair had purposely *not* announced on their website ) 

It caused such a fuss with the Ryanair staff being absolute twats that eventually a First class passenger at a British airways desk opposite stepped in and paid the extra for them and he still had to argue because they were saying they couldn't except payment as his credit card was not linked to their flight. He went to the cash point, got the cash out and literally threw it at them to the cheers of people waiting in the check-in line. 

Just horrid wankers. 



But... the last couple of years it's honestly like someone has shit fairy dust on their staff. It's just a completely different experience. You actually get to your destination relaxed instead of wound up like you've just experienced what it's like being cattle led to slaughter.

Well...

&gt; sent hundreds of British troops and sailors to their death and caused the death of many more Argentinian conscripts rather than seeking a negotiated end to the conflict, or simply using the RN's submarine fleet to prevent resupply and ""starve"" them out

It was not Thatcher that did not want to negotiate. It was Argentine intransigence that made loss of life in a war inevitable - in addition to the loss of life caused by the Argentine invasion in the first place.

Nor is starving them out by a submarine blockade a feasible proposition when the Argentine forces on the islands could be, and to a substantial extent were in fact, re-supplied by air.

Honestly, attacking a British PM who uses the armed forces to recover British sovereign territory from a foreign aggressor is a bit fucking disingenuous. Why do you think we have armed forces in the first place?

Now it may be fair to level some criticism at Thatcher, her government, and the civil service at the time, for failing to recognise the Argentine threat and for failing to send a strong enough message that the British were prepared to fight for the islands.

But criticising her for actually fighting to recover British territory from a foreign aggressor just makes you look puerile.

The Midfield is a bit of a worry to me. As much as I like James, King, and Drinkwater,  I don't think they are quite good enough - especially without Cambiasso. If he goes we will urgently need to replace him. If we spend big money it should be in midfield. I suppose if Cambi goes he will free up some big wages.  

Mahrez working off the front 2 is brilliant, and I think he will get stronger. I think a combo of Ulloa, Vardy and Kramaric will be good. Not sure how Nuge will come into it. Maybe flipping Nuge and Ulloa with Vardy and Krama could work well. 

So sentiments may need to go out the window 😐 and we may need to say goodbye to a few familiar faces and bring in 2 or 3 quality replacements.

I am all for reforming people from non-violent crime such as drug possessions, theft, fraud etc, as the resulting fallout won't result in severe physical and psychological harm against another individual. Its a mitigated risk, as the failure is not going to ruin someone's life. But when it comes to a violent offender, you do have to consider is it fair to a potential future victim to take that risk of reintroduce them to society as reformed, when there is still a chance they may relapse to previous violent behaviours. No one is ever truly reformed, until the day they pass away having never re-offended and professionals don't always get it right, the human psych and brain is still unsure ground to the medical world. 

I don't think we should. If someone is capable of doing that to another human being, we need to not ever allow them to be free  to do that again. I would actually prefer that we stop locking up drug addicts who make the largest population in prison, and give them treatment, and instead use prison space to keep people who are violent permanently removed from society.

Do you have any siblings?

What are you going to do if interest rates start to rise?  Are you prepared to get a second, or third job, in addition to the lodgers?

You don't mention a boyfriend/girlfriend of your own.  How would that change the equation?

What are your job prospects like?  Realistically.  You don't have to answer here but you need to be clear in your own head. If you're still going to be earning minimum wage in 5 years, it'll be a struggle.

This is important because you can't afford to lose your job. EVER. You can't even afford to take a month off between jobs.  

You talk about taking over the mortgage but clearly you don't earn enough to qualify for a mortgage on your own.  Do you mean you'll be just paying your Mum's mortgage and the house will stay in her name?

If it stays in your Mum's name there are all sorts of disasters on the horizon.  For example: if she marries her partner and then divorce after ten years, he could get half the house you've half paid off.  If she dies without a will (or if her will pre-dates their marriage) it becomes *his* house.  I know everyone says they'll do the honourable thing but... you know... money!

Overall it's a good plan but you need to think through every potential problem and how you'll cope.  How will you feel giving up your car, Netflix and your mobile phone because you've got a higher mortgage payment?  How would you feel when your mates are going out on Saturday night and you can't afford it?  What about when they go to Aya Napa?  Or Amsterdam ;)

My only real advice would be to concentrate on the mortgage and pay it off or at least down as soon as possible.  Paying an extra £100 a month makes a surprising difference to the term of the loan.

No more to say.

Rose - 9

Another personal development player, has worked tirelessly against the disdain of the fanbase to become one of the best left backs in the league.

Chadli - 8

Again, individual progress is a big factor here. Chadli has reinforced the squads goalscoring tally by being a reliable attacking force, and has all round really benefited the squad in key games.

Yeah they were fringe parties people were reluctant to move to. But as people were continually ignored by their traditional parties, they moved to UKIP. Plenty of Labour voters tried to stick with Labour, but kept being told they were racists, so they abandoned it. Plenty of Tories tried to stick with the Tories, but kept being told they were racists, so they abandoned them.

&gt;Funnily enough, those most likely to vote UKIP are in some of the least diverse areas in the UK. These people come into contact with foreigners far less than those less willing to vote UKIP.

I know, but that's irrelevant. The people willing to vote UKIP have a view of those areas as no longer being British. They don't live there, they walk through or read about them, so that's the opinion they form. That's the reality we have to deal with, whether it's right or wrong is irrelevant.
 
&gt; Do you have anything that argues otherwise?

Yes, the European elections which UKIP did well in before the 2010 GE, continuing their trend. The Tories did use it as an attack on Labour, simply because the Tories were the first mainstream party to see the writing on the wall, and managed to use it to their advantage.

Your attitude exemplifies why there is such anti immigration feeling in the UK. You are trying to deny it even existed for the decades where it was suppressed through social shaming, but it existed.

---

&gt;The __pizza effect__ is a term used especially in [religious studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies) and [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology) for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,  or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.  It is named after the idea that modern [pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza) was developed among [Italian immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American) [in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_immigration_to_the_United_States) (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [Italian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine).

Do you mean the 2014 election where they came first? Or the 2009 election where they tied with Labour for 2nd place with a massive 0.3% vote swing (out of the giant turn out as well!)?

&gt; I know, but that's irrelevant

No it's not. If people have these views because of perceptions, then you need to look at where the perceptions are coming from and whether they are accurate. When media portrays a segment of society in a certain way AND you have no other contact with that segment of society, you leave yourself open to being easily manipulated. Those who have the stereotype counted by real life experiences tend to rate immigration as a lower concern. 

&gt; You are trying to deny it even existed for the decades where it was suppressed through social shaming, but it existed. Millions of people have cared for decades

I am not denying people have held immigration as an important concern. Rather, I am saying that BOTH extent of people who have this attitude AND the degree to which it is held as important, has risen rapidly recently. I.e. people might have been against immigration before, but it became a *bigger* issue to them more recently as well as more people holding this view. 

Generally attitudes like these become more prevalent in times of recessions or tight fiscal policies, and I would argue it has been the same here - that the rise corresponds to the past financial crises. We saw immigration get raised in the 2010 GE, the Tories pollicised it to attack Labour (despite not arguing against it during the parliament term), this legitimised UKIP and they rose in the 2014 EE, the Tories and Labour moved right on immigration issues to challenge them in 2015 GE.

The Court took issue with the totality of the ban. The reason wasn't just because of ""barmy European judges"" as the tabloids suggest, but because the UK is one of a small number of member states of the CoE that still maintains a total ban. The others that do are countries like Belarus and Russia - there were some others, but basically it's not an encouraging set of comrades.

In issues like these where the ECtHR declares a state has not fulfilled its obligations under the Convention, they consider the position of other states party to the convention. This is called the ""margin of appreciation"" - if a government can successfully show that there is substantial disagreement around an issue within the CoE member states, the court usually defers to national legislatures. It's obviously tremendously more complex than that, but in this case with prisoners voting what it boils down to is that there is a standard across states which are signatories to the convention such that a total ban on prisoners voting (as opposed to, say, a ban on prisoners serving sentences longer than a year) was declared to be incompatible with the Convention.",null,0,null,1432635651,null,0,false,0,crl6v7h,null,t3_376wnb,null,t1_crl6v7h,null,t1_crkcxrm,null,null,null,1433271955,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

For how much to invest some platforms will have a minimum and some will have a flat fee + their % fee, I THINK that Cofunds and Fidelity are both just % fees without flat fees, but Fidelity MAY have a flat yearly charge as well, so make sure you check that if you are investing a relatively small amount.

What evidence? 40% of French people are atheist. Are they not a civilised, peaceful country? What about Scandinavia? What are the most war mongering countries on the planet today? Do they coincide in any way with atheism in either the general population or the political elite? 

&gt;I want to believe that you're right. I really, really do. But in all my years of searching I have never found a single group of atheists which was even remotely close to what you claim is the majority position.

The point is that atheists almost by definition don't congregate in groups. This is simply a fact. It is supported inevitably by basic arithmetic. If tens of millions of people in every European country identify as being atheist, and get you can't find a single European atheist organisation with even 100,000 members, you have to accept that the remaining hundred million or so (at least) simply don't congregate according to their lack of belief in god. They are just normal people.

* *Trophies and CL Football every season*: Noone/very few is saying we need that every season, but it's been three seasons now with big spending and other top teams underperforming. This ""financially we are supposed to be 5th"" argument.. we ended 6th, could easily have been 7th. We were the 14th best team in the league when it comes to creating chances.

* *Loyalty from our players (but disloyalty from other players we want to buy or we want to sell)*: Yes many have been complaining about Serling, but the biggest issue for the other half and me is that if Sterling leaves then the club has lost 3 of the most important players in 2 years. Who leaves after next season? Coutinho and Sakho?

* *Owners who invest (even though FFP stops it)*: The owners do invest, money has just been spent badly, and FFP doesn't stop it anymore. 

* *World Class players (that we can't afford or attract)*: We couldn't afford or attract Bony, Benteke, Schneiderlin/Wanyama or the countless other good options in other leagues? Far less people would be complaining about lack of world class players if we got value for our money.

* *World Class manager (that we can't afford or attract)*: We can obviously afford another manager, Rodgers is very well paid, but you might be correct on attracting.

* *Lower ticket prices so the local working class fans can cheer our team on to success (but we also want more money)*: Bundesliga has very low ticket prices and the teams except for Bayern has much smaller budgets but they still manage. The CEO of Bayern said that ticket incomine makes up a small part of the total budget anyway so it's not worth it to them to take a lot of the fans' money.

* *To get rid of Gerrard because his performances have been terrible all season (but also keep him because he's a legend)*: Most fans here wanted him to be used as a sub this season, to come on at minute 50-70 as an AM/CM, which I'm 100% sure would be a better use than playing him 90 minutes when he plays, often as DM.

* *Play exciting football because we don't want boring Chelsea football (but also want to win things)*: Yeah really stupid to want to not be a bottom half team in terms of creating chances. I'd rather not win things while entertaining/scoring than not win things while keeping possession in our own half.

* *A new stadium (but still lots of money on new players and wages)*: Don't want to spend more money on players and wages, want to spend the same amount of money on better, often more experienced players. 

* *All of the above ASAP otherwise the owners are rubbish, the manager needs sacking, and the players are all useless*: Yes, if by ASAP you mean signs of going in the right direction after three years.",null,0,null,1432637403,null,0,1432638424,0,crl7a9e,null,t3_37awjc,null,t1_crl7a9e,null,t3_37awjc,null,null,null,1433272152,null,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15,null

(Not a dedicated service like Cambridge House seems to be, and no crisis facility, just a room in the GP's surgery.) 

Unfortunately the Community Psych nurse considered me ""too complicated"" and within the first ten minutes had told me that all the diagnoses I'd had in the past were wrong. I've got a handful - ADD, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizotypal Personality Disorder and C-PTSD. I'm open to the idea that not all of these diagnoses are accurate, but they were all given after extensive testing by psychiatrists rather than ten minutes' introductory chat with a psych nurse, so the idea that I should just jettison them all, STFU and do my CBT worksheet like a good girl didn't go down too well. 

I got referred to another psych nurse who was better than the first, but she still wasn't a lot of use. Basically, she could give me worksheets (which I would just lose or forget to bring with me because, y'know, ADD) and let me cry on her shoulder, but that was about it. 

I eventually got referred to the Royal Edinburgh for psychotherapy to help deal with the PTSD, which was great - but it was quite specifically for that. I was really grateful to be getting that kind of help, so I didn't want to keep pestering for help with the ADD. I've brought it up every time I've spoken to the GP about my mental health, but so far it's never yielded anything. I'm hoping my current request will - this was the first time I'd encountered a GP who actually seemed to believe me when I said that I did have a formal diagnosis, and it wasn't my fault if the bloody notes were lost. I actually saw him type in that I was to get a referral request, so now I'm just waiting and crossing my fingers. 

(I should probably mention that in terms of my initial diagnosis, it wasn't actually something I sought out. ADD had never occurred to me - I thought I was just disorganised, crap at life and unable to find any middle ground between failing to concentrate on a task and being unable to *stop* concentrating on it. I was actually seeing a psychiatrist about the PTSD and she noticed my patterns and asked to test me. My scores were in the highest bracket.)

Assuming you will retire and be a basic rate tax payer then there is no additional benefit for you to contribute to a pension at this time over any other investment. A stocks and shares ISA would be tax free and you could use these funds for future pension contributions should you be a higher rate tax payer or have an additional reason to make a pension contribution.

Going forward, it's my view that Kenny was never going to be a manager who built a team from the ground up. FSG wanted a root and branch over-haul, developing through the youth teams where possible and buying potential stars and undervalued experience where they had to (Moneyball).

The league position was the thing that did Kenny in. FSG's point of view is that the league is the only thing that matters because of CL qualification, everything else is frippery.

Rodgers seems to be the type of person FSG want but in a purely coaching role. They fudged a big decision by putting in a committee (allegedly Rodgers wouldn't work under a single DoF) and everything bad you've heard about them is probably true. There needs to be a single person carrying out the will of the owners, and the coach then needs to work with what he's given. This might be the ultimatum that Rodgers is given in the close season, get another year but work under the structure that FSG wants him to. Take away the responsibility of transfers and just coach the team.

I'm sure Ian Ayre is a good bloke, but I don't think he's someone that should be having anything to do with transfers. He was hired as the Commercial Director and I'm not sure how that translates into being part of a DoF-type committee. Look at which teams on the continent have had success above their apparent level and see who's in charge of their transfers, then hire them.

Make sure the Academy has all it needs to produce top class players buying them in where there's obvious talent available (Sterling, Sinclair, Ibe and Ojo were all bought). Then tie the DoF into the academy so that any potential coach doesn't have too much undue influence on youth team setups. 

Any coach we get in must be aligned to the Academy, not the other way around. The Barcelona system that's hyped produces players that the coach is then given to work with. When we switched to a back three this season the youth team then did the same, which I couldn't comprehend. For me, the Academy is there to produce talent not try to mirror the first team. If the Academy is playing 3-4-3 and good players are being left out to accommodate that system then the Academy isn't fulfilling its purpose.

The realisation for me is that you really can't lose weight with exercise. Exercise is good because it makes you healthy, but the downside is lots of exercise makes you feel hungry after you do it, plus it just doesn't burn that many calories.

Running for 3 miles burns about 300 calories, that's only slightly more than a bag of Doritos!

Losing weight is simply getting a calorie deficit, you need calories in to be less than calories out. Everything else is more or less irrelevant.

What I did was get a [rough estimate](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm) of you base metabolic rate, that's how much energy you use just in being alive for a day. Then eat that (eating less than that is bad because your body will think you're starving). 

But you have to count everything, and that includes beer! 

I found a way to easily make sure I didn't go over my BMR (which was 1600) was to use intermittent fasting (this worked for me but other people like lots of tiny meals so I really don't think it matters), this works by doing all your eating in a relatively short time period in the day, for me I ate only in the 5 hours between 2pm and 7pm, so I planned about 1600 calories in that period (really small lunch about 2pm, then snack about 4, really intense gym from 5-6 then meal at about 6:30). Outside of this you can drink water coffee and green/black tea but you can't eat anything. 

I didn't really worry about being healthy, I ate a mars bar a couple of times a week and stuff and went out for meals and stuff, but I kept to the general plan on the vast majority of days, and always made sure I averaged around my BMR for a week.

I lost about 15 kg in 2 months, which is more than is technically healthy, but its ok I think.

null,false,DeadOptimist,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; where a fringe party came tied second

A fringe party whose fringe WAS the EU? This was the focal point of the party. It was also an election with a very low turn out, meaning those more engaged (which usually translates to more polarised or extreme views) are going to have a bigger impact. 

Of course, come the 2010 GE you saw how fringe UKIP was - getting only 900,000 votes across the country (3.1% - below the cut off in many PR systems). 

&gt; If you are really trying to argue that nobody in the Tory party was aware of losing members to UKIP over immigration, and that it wasn't rising to be a hot issue which they just latched on to, then there's just no point us talking as you are denying reality.

The Tory party who, during the 2009 EE, also gained voters? In fact, the Tories gained a 1% swing during that election (bigger swing than UKIP got). And, of course, the Tories were no. 1 at that election. So why should the Tories have been worried about UKIP in 2009? Are you just going to say ""they should have been"" and leave it at that, or are you actually going to make an argument based on facts? Because where I am sitting, in 2009 the Tories had nothing to worry about. 

&gt; ""Oh you're wrong because you're ignorant"" is not a winning argument.

Well, if you understand why people are upset over something it means you can target it in more meaningful ways. If it turns out that people are not actually racist and are not actually against sitting next to a foreigner, but are in fact are worried about jobs, houses and future prospects, you can target the underlying issues as opposed to band aid the symptoms. 

&gt; we're doomed

Your whole argument is ""the UK has secretly hated immigrants for the last 30 years but said and done nothing about it until 2010"". 

I do not buy this. I believe immigration was used as a political tool, but then got warped to represent genuine concern. I do not think vast swaths of the UK are racist and dislike foreigners. Rather, I believe a significant segment of the UK are worried about houses, jobs, costs and so on and directing this worry towards immigration. And that these worries were exacerbated by the recent financial crises.

After all, UKIP ""only"" has its 4m votes, which is out of 65m total or 45m electorate. And even then, those who support UKIP do not do it for the same reasons. Some might particularly target immigration, but some might target EU regulation and UK sovereignty. 

Again, in the EE in 2009 immigration was a relative non-issue. UKIP's manifesto gave as much attention to immigration as it did to Agriculture &amp; Fisheries. In the 2009 EE, the other parties barely touched it. 

However, the Tories used Labours poor showing in the EE as an attack on Gordon Brown. This followed through to the GE, and you got the ""bigot"" comment from GB. This allowed the issue of immigration to be politicised. And with this came the rise of UKIP.

Hay-on-Wye / Y Gelli is an essential stop if you love books. It might be best to visit when they're isn's something on, as parking will be easier. http://www.hay-on-wye.co.uk/

Ludlow is about half-way up the border in the East. It is on the English side of the border, but it's connected to the history of Wales and still has a nice castle. http://www.castlewales.com/ludlow.html

The walking trails through my home town, Knighton / Trefyclawdd tend to be long-distance. The Offa's Dyke Trail runs the east side of Wales and K is the half-way point. There's a reasonable run of the dyke between Presteigne / Llanandras to the south of the town and a small museum at Knighton, http://www.offasdyke.demon.co.uk/odc.htm but I'd suggest this more if you were passing through than deliberately heading here.

There are some picturesque towns in the east. Montgomery / Trefaldwyn is far prettier than it needs to be, but there's not a lot there. It'd be worth a short stop if you're passing through, but again, given the main roads don't go there, if you are passing through you'll have taken a wrong turn.

There's Powis Castle by Welshpool  / Y Trallwng. That's a National Trust site. http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/powis-castle/ If you're planning on visiting a lot of National Trust sites, it might make sense to buy membership for a year at the first one, and you'll save money in parking fees and entrance. Otherwise it can get expensive.

Old Oswestry (English side of the border again) is an Iron Age hillfort you can walk over and get some nice views. That's likely to change due to urban development. http://oldoswestryhillfort.co.uk/

Up towards Wrexham there's Llangollen, http://www.new.llangollen.org.uk/ which is definitely worth a stop. It sits on the river Dee in a very pretty way and there's a few other sites around it. Get a good view and you can see why the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is a UNESCO site. http://www.pontcysyllte-aqueduct.co.uk/ There's also the Valle Crucis Abbey by there http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/vallecrucisabbey/?lang=en

The fact that a country with a minority of atheists is peaceful does not mean atheists are peaceful - in fact as I've said several times now (and this is a point you have yet to address), every time atheists have formed a government they have immediately begun brutal persecution.

&gt; What are the most war mongering countries on the planet today? Do they coincide in any way with atheism in either the general population or the political elite?

Historically, yes there is a direct correlation between countries ruled by atheists and countries which carry out violent repression - every country ruled by atheists practicing state atheism has done so.

&gt; The point is that atheists almost by definition don't congregate in groups. This is simply a fact.

You keep saying this and I keep pointing out the numerous atheist groups which show this is false: the brights, r/atheism and so on.

&gt; you have to accept that the remaining hundred million or so (at least) simply don't congregate according to their lack of belief in god. They are just normal people.

That doesn't follow at all, like saying that because there's a gay person on TV no one else is gay or they'd be on TV. I've said this already, but you can't prove a positive (""atheists are normal people"") with a negative (""atheists don't congregate"").

Checking your answers helps. Where I lose marks is almost always on silly little things, and accuracy errors. One thing you might want to try is working backwards from your result to the question, through the steps of working you've made, just to check it all makes sense.

Something else you should do: only round your work at the final stage, rather than step by step. So if you're doing a calculator question, and you need to multiply 85.4768901 or whatever, use that long number. Don't round it to 85.48, or 85.5 because that's going to lessen the accuracy of your work. That's a place where you'd lose marks, because rounding too early would impact the eventual answer.

Past papers and stuff helps too, but equally, use the time wisely. Don't bother with a whole paper, just select questions you need to work on. Or start halfway through the paper, to target the more difficult areas.

Mathswatch someone already mentioned, and that's a pretty great resource. Also I've found this helps - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVu2eAdRxexxvCS2zd7O_w. It's a maths channel with all sorts of useful things.

My point wasn't ""she could get worse"". My point was ""saying she went up to 46 is trying to paint a worse picture than just gaining 1 stone"". 

They could have said:

1) she lost 17 stone

2) she lost 18 stone and gained back 1 stone

But they went with:

3) she lost 18 stone and returned to 46

No. 3 IMO is misleading. A little like asking ""when did you stop beating your wife"". 

&gt; she was forced onto a diet by the hospital.

Could be. All I have to go by is the article, which says:

&gt; Georgia had shed 18 stone after vowing to eat healthily.

Which doesn't read as ""the hospital made her do it"" to me. But could well be the case. Either way, she lost 17 stone in a year, without any surgery, and I think that's a massive improvement.

My point wasn't to rationalise how she is, my point was to criticise the article. I felt like the article was trying to paint the situation as being worse than it is (of course it is bad though) by misleading over her weight loss and over the costs of this.

Taken seriously doesn't mean they put their best act forward, it means the country gets behind their act, they enjoy the event, support them and want them to do well.

They take the concept of Eurovision as a positive thing seriously.

It's never been about the power of a country's music industry, otherwise the UK would win every year, it's about amateur artists given a big stage and the fun of the big event.

The UK gets sour because we have this strong music industry and we don't win. I think most of the public in the UK misses the point, we shouldn't send our Adeles or Muses (or even Blue).

We should be sending people who have some good talented singer/songwriters who in the past had limited outlets, but now they turn to BBC's introducing and other such avenues.

Unfortunately years of sour grapes and whining have put talented people off the contest, instead of a fun performance event they see it as career suicide.

To be honest I think the UK should leave, because as a country we collectively missed the point and our whinging is ruining the contest (something which the EV officials have said for years). We scoff at the concept of building bridges between countries while we ponder a referendum on leaving the EU.

I don't really get your point in the second paragraph; the rules of accessing pensions have been completely re-written as of April 6th this year and there are no income limits to ""income drawdown"" plans. At any rate, the withdrawal caps on drawdown pensions have always been above 5% (typically between 6% and 8% depending on factors such as GAD rates, age, etc.), and so wouldn't be an issue.

I think you're possibly misunderstanding how withdrawals from invested funds works. A typical investment will produce a return consisting of capital growth (share price growth, basically) and income (dividends in the case of shares, coupon payments in the case of fixed interest, and rent from property investments). A withdrawal rate of &lt;3.5% would theoretically mean that you are never spending capital, thus it is deemed ""safe"".

This goes for drawdown pensions *and* S&amp;S ISAs. The underlying investments can be identical, the income and growth identical, the only difference is the tax treatment ([I have written a comparison table in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment#wiki_step_4.3A_additional_savings_for_the_long-term_in_a_stocks_.26_shares_nisa_or_a_pension.))

As for your main question; the answer is probably to do both.

Say you have £500,000 saved; £250k in ISA and £250k in pension. You retire at 40. You take a 3.5% withdrawal (£17,500) every year to live on. For the first fifteen years you can only access your ISA (actually, by the time you reach 55, the minimum age is likely to be 58 thanks to the ""n-10"" linking of private pension access), so you take 7% from the ISA. This will run the ISA down (based on my calculations the 50th percentile value based on 5% growth and 2% inflation is £86k, but the 10th percentile is £20k, so beware the random chance effect), but you will be taking no withdrawals from the pension, and so the capital value will appreciate by way of foregone interest. At the point you hit 55 you re-assess, and adjust your income sources accordingly.

On the other hand, Alexandre Dumas had this to say about pizza in Naples in the 19th century:

”The pizza is a sort of bun; it is round, and made of the same dough as bread. It is of different sizes according to the price. A pizza of two farthings suffices for one person, a pizza of two sous is enough to satisfy a whole family. At first sight, the pizza appears to be a simple dish, upon examination it proves to be compound. The pizza is prepared with bacon, with lard, with cheese, with tomatas, with fish. It is the gastronomic thermometer of the market. The price of the pizza rises and falls according to the rate of the ingredients just designated; according to the abundance or scarcity of the year.”

The BBC news director herself said that when she arrived there was a ""deep liberal bias"" at the BBC regarding some issues including immigration.

Coverage of the indepedence referendum was the nail in the coffin for me.  You can read a full report from Dr John Robertson here - https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/john-robertson/bbc-bias-and-scots-referendum-new-report - but a few examples of biased reporting is below;

*- On 29/10/12 in Reporting Scotland, an extensive piece on Trident and on Scotland’s defence forces after independence offers some space for SNP response but is driven by a weight of one-sided and unchallenged evidence and commentary – unnamed economic advisers are allowed to suggest 6500 jobs lost if Trident goes and an overall cost of £20bn while the report finishes ominously with ‘Whitehall could play hardball’.*

*- On 11/12/12, in Reporting Scotland, the programme opens with ‘Row over independence could lead to higher electricity bills’ then runs through a series of negative sound bites interspersed with SNP protest – ‘questions mount over independence’, ‘UK government claims cost could rise’, ‘Could Scots customers have to pay more?’, ‘Labour spokesman – danger’ before allowing the evidence of Scottish over-production, renewables and a captive market in England to cast serious doubt on the motivation for the initial headline ‘scare’.*

*Health-related matters were the other dominant theme. For example, on 27/9/12 the case of a Scottish patient seeking free care only available in England was highlighted and linked to the relative lack of GP control in Scotland. This began a mini-series of reports that day on alleged failings in the Scottish NHS by Reporting Scotland reporters and by Labour spokespersons. No balancing cases were reported of a flow in the other direction although such did appear in the popular press (‘Now English asthma patients are denied life-changing drug offered to Scots’, Daily Mail, 9/11/12). The use of single cases to suggest wider concerns is of course problematic.*

You can also google is the BBC biased and I'm sure you would find plenty of groups who would agree that they are.  

For an idea of the corruption at the BBC, you don't have to look much further than the ongoing scandal regarding pedophiles in broadcasting.  The BBC has been complicit and has no defense regarding it's inaction to investigate complaints and reports against it's star presenters.  

Oh aye, and let's not forget when they paid George Entwistle £500,000 for 50 days work.  The BBC is as corrupt and biased as The Telgraph, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, Channel 4, and ITV.

There is absolutely no factual evidence that children brought up in SS relationships fail to integrate successfully into society, yet there is mounting evidence that they do just as well as children Hetero families.

There are already children being brought up in same sex couples in NI. All you are doing is denying one of the Partners the right to legal guardianship of that child, so if the biological/adopting parent dies or something happens them, that child will then need to go into care instead of being with the other parent who has been raising them.

How is a child in care, better than a child in a caring home?

It's basically a scripted Keto/Paleo kind of thing.

The thing is, it clearly works because you are:

- Doing a short but high intensity (HIIT) workout 4-5 times a week to burn a bunch of calories and get your heart fitter
- ONLY eating carbs immediately after the workout, to give you a quick energy burst to carry on the day  
- At all other times just eating protein and green veg. Chicken, steak, eggs - that sort of thing
- Drinking loads of water, rather than beer.

There's literally no way you can fail to lose weight if you cut out everything unhealthy, make your body switch to fat as a fuel source and then exercise more.

The recipes are great but if you're used to getting home and chucking something in the oven or microwave then the sheer amount of actual cooking is kind of intense.  That's more of a commitment than the exercise, which only takes about 30 mins including getting changed and having a shower.

At it's most straight forward you can't build reasonably priced property in UK city centres because the whole reasonably priced bit means you would be selling it for under market value which then means people buy it up to resell it at market value. That's what would happen in a free market.  Who would even build such property to sell it for under market value?

One way it would really be possible is if you take the whole free market part out of the equation and so the government build government housing, it's rented out and it's never allowed to be sold into the free market.  Good luck seeing any UK government do that.  It's never going to happen in the political climate of the UK.

Within a free market the only real possibility of affordable housing in city centres is if we get into a massive over supply situation but that's looking fairly unlikely for the time being.  Demand is outstripping supply and just not enough properties are being built to keep up with demand.   Of course there are also space limits.

Of course some bias is going to seep into opinion pieces, no news organisation can be completely immune.

But there's a crucial thing here that is supported by wikipedia's ""Criticism of the BBC"" page. The BBC get a very similar amount of complaints from every part of the political spectrum.

&gt; Former political editor Andrew Marr argued in 2006 that the liberal bias of the BBC is the product of the types of people the Corporation employs, and is thus cultural not political. In 2011, Peter Oborne wrote in his Daily Telegraph blog, ""Rather than representing the nation as a whole, it [the BBC] has become a vital resource – and sometimes attack weapon – for a narrow, arrogant Left-Liberal elite"".

This is followed by;
&gt; Other commentators have taken the opposite view and criticised the BBC for being part of The Establishment. The commentator Mehdi Hasan in the New Statesman pointed out the right-wing backgrounds of many BBC presenters and journalists, querying why even many ""liberals and leftists"" accept the right's description of BBC bias. Guardian columnist Owen Jones is also of the opinion that the BBC is biased towards the right owing to numerous key posts being filled by Conservatives.

 So yes, many groups agree that the BBC is biased. But these groups are not all of the same views or political persuasion.

As for corruption, I'd much rather see some evidence of current corruption rather than corruption before I was even born.

Also, sometimes weight related issues stem from phycology problems. We would agree that if a parent let their kid starve they should be prosecuted for neglect, but I am sure we would also agree that the parent of an anorexic kid shouldn't be prosecuted (just on that fact). 

I can see valid reasons why neglect might be expanded to cover cases like this though. If her parents simply followed a hospital prescribed diet for her, she would have little option but to follow it. So in a way they are directly responsible for her condition.

There's an awful lot of talk and outrage on this sub over potential prices being discussed for players like Benteke. Though I won't disagree with the fact that £20-30 million is a lot of money, it sure as hell isn't what it used to be.

I made a similar point last year when people were discussing the Lallana transfer. I think people expect Benteke to be rated as a £10-15million player and It's just not like that anymore. We're living in times where players are moving clubs for £70-80 million and players like Ross McCormack are being sold (and bought) for £11million. When we were linked with Bony for ~£20 million, people were expressing similar dismay over that figure too, but as soon as he went to City I noticed alot of ""Why didn't we get Bony"" talk floating around. I'm almost positive that this is an essentially identical situation.

I understand that people want us to exercise caution with the players we target, but why not spend £25 million on Benteke. He's young, strong, talented and knows the league. People seem to get up in arms about the ""worth"" of some players. I don't know if this is because Villa aren't exotic enough a club to buy from (as Swansea weren't either), but no one can deny he's a great player. I understand to a degree that some of last seasons signings have thus far seemed pretty naive, but expecting to get a quality striker that fits into FSG's model for less the amounts being discussed is equally naive.

I'm an only child.

Honestly, I don't know much about interest rates and the fact that they may rise. This is something I would have to have a proper look into. I am however prepaired to get additional jobs and cut spending on things I don't neccessarily need. Also, I would obviously charge a lodger to stay in one of the rooms in the house.

No girlfriend right now. No one is lucky enough! Although, even if I was in a somewhat serious releationship I couldn't see that making a difference to this situation. I wouldn't really want to be living together with someone anytime soon. 

Job prospects aren't amazing to be honest. The office job I have at present does have some development opportunities but it's not a very interesting job or something I'd want to pursue. Plus the people higher up than me still complain about the pay. I didn't leave school with much to show and would most likely need to go back into education to get a job that I both enjoy and that pays well. 

After I'm paid this month I will have just under £3K in my current account. I plan on adding to this and getting an emergency fund sorted out in another account. I'm also owed over £600 from my best mate and a family member... 

The plan was to have the mortgage in my name. My mother would literally be selling me the house. However, after some of the responses here, I realise I probably can't even do this. We wouldn't go through with her moving out and me living on my own if the house was still in her name. 

I wouldn't worry about any complications from her getting married. I grew up with my mother and father trying to get a messy divorce sorted out for about 7 years. So I can't see her going through property hassle again! This idea generally came about due to my mum wanting to leave me something significant. She's not ill or anything - but if I own the house we currently live in then I've got a pretty good start in life I think.

I wouldn't have a problem with not spending much for long periods of time. As I said in the post, saving money is something I quite enjoy anyway.

All of this would obviously be something I'd like to have a sit down with a professional and discuss. For the time being though - the feedback here is really helpful. So thank you again.

a) That pretty much everything is a work related issue for a public official.

b) That all lying is the same severity.

c) That because all lying is the same severity, we should ignore lying because everyone does it, and one lie is pretty much like another.

d) That no job would survive integrity.

e) That we don't want or need to encourage truth in our politicians.


In fact, I believe pretty much the opposite of most of these:

a) I think some things are more work-related than others. Lying about liking custard is a minor thing for a politician, and worth maybe a bit of a laugh in the papers. Lying about releasing a document aimed to denigrate a rival during an election is severe.

b) I don't believe all lying is the same severity. If Bob says he's great at coding in his job interview, and isn't - that is nothing like the same as Bob putting down fraudulent expenses applications.

c) Because I don't think all lying is the same severity, I think the argument that ""everyone lies"" is a red herring. The question becomes more: is this a significant lie?

d) I also think we need to question what sort of job someone is doing with respect to their required level of integrity. If a street sweeper lies about how long they took for their work break, I'm not that bothered. But the more influence someone has on society, the more I think it matters. MPs have a lot of influence. Timing, too. At times of elections, influence is really important.

e) Finally, I think there's a knock-on effect. I don't believe the current climate of important people getting away with things (be they bankers or MPs) is a good thing. And I think there's a lot of mileage to be had in making the climate unwelcome for certain types of lack of integrity.

null,false,landaaan,null,null,null,"&gt;There's nothing inherently wrong with capitalism, eg, the exchange of goods and labour for money

There are many things inherently wrong with it. In fact, one of the most influential philosophers that ever lived wrote an entire book about it. 

In [Das Kapital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm) Marx agues that capitalism contains inherent contradictions. For example, in order to compete in a capitalist marketplace, a capitalist has to strive to create a product/service with the fewest, lowest paid workers, which eliminates the consumers he needs to buy his products/services.

But the most obvious issues are exploitation and alienation. A worker is paid to produce a commodity, in doing so he creates something with value. This commodity is then sold. In order for the capitalist to make a profit, he must pay the worker less than the value of created by his work. The worker did the work, but the capitalist kept the profit. This is called exploitation [of surplus value]. Oh but the worker has a choice, I hear you say. Yes, the worker has a choice, he either sells his labour for a wage, or he starves to death. Right now as I type this, in India, [people are doing manual labour in a heatwave](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-32877207) because they have to chose between dying from heat exhaustion or starving to death. [Almost 800 have died so far](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32880180).

Alienation is a slightly more abstract problem that has more to do with psychology as sociology. It is an idea that were are separated from the product of our labour because we are forced to do unfulfilling work in poor conditions for somebody else. Furthermore we have to compete with each other to keep our jobs, which alienates us from each other. It is socially and psychologically damaging.

When the Henry group came in they changed things. They increased spending, upgraded the park, spent massively on youth development and the fan intensity came with that. Liverpool have much more demanding an intense fans than the Red Sox did at that point. In 1999-2002 I used to walk down to Fenway and buy tickets off scalpers for at most $5 and the bleachers would be half empty.

Liverpool now are nothing like the sad-sack franchises in American sports. We had a bad season after a good season.

As I've said in just about every post on this sub about Lavezzi, the guy has merit. He's not everything we want, but I think he'd be, at least, a serviceable signing. 

1. He creates space. He drags defenders on runs that will free up Harry to make more of his magic. 

2. He creates chances. Partially, this is through his space creation, but the guy can also pick out a good pass. 

3. Though his finishing leaves something to be desired, he's still much better than Soldado. The guy scored just about as many goals in one game as Soldado has all season. Yes, he isn't Zlatan in front of goal, but if Lavezzi and Lamela had a chance at the same shot, I'd pick Lavezzi 9/10. (The 1/10 is in case the shot had to be a rabona.)

Let's not forget that in his prime (even with dodgey knees) Ledley King was one of the best centre backs in the world and he came from just the other side of Hackney Marshes. Many will debate that, but the man didn't train and he would run around and get the job done with an abundance of authority over his back line.

4 extra points this season and we would have finished in 5th place, 5 fewer points and we would have finished 8th again.

It's difficult to say without full transparency of the decision-making process.  One strong contender is badger culling, but there are numerous other smaller cases such as protecting listed buildings from demolition and giving funding to specific heritage and environmental projects.

There's also a letter where he ""lobbied for a specific individual to be given a role for an agricultural arbitrator, although the name is redacted"":


&gt; I understand that the proposal would be for an independent arbitrator to be appointed to be appointed to deal with individual complaints in an entirely private way. I suggested that it might be worth considering (redacted) for this role. (Redacted) might have the time to do it and I would think (redacted) would have all the necessary skills for the job.

No, well need to do other things too. But yes, I'm saying we need to compete with Chelsea's spending if we want to achieve on that level in the long term. 

&gt;One thing would be to not hire an inexperienced manager and sack him right away when everything isn't going our way.

* Nice area

Given that both he and his partner are on less than £20k each, I asked where he would be happy to compromise. ""I'm not"", he responded. I told him that the ""compromise"" is that he'll be paying off someone else s mortgage for the foreseeable future because a) There's no house currently on sale around here for that price and b) he'll be paying so much in rent he'll never be able to save a deposit.

That was right around the time we kept leaking the salaries that he was rejecting.

This current revisionism that Liverpool underpays for talent is interesting, as usually the problem is how much Liverpool is overpaying for unproven talent.  Unless you're talking about underpaying the players themselves?  Which, again, is not in line with the usual litany of problems Liverpool has been known for.  We've been talking about clearing ""dead wood"" off the bench for years now because we were overpaying people we weren't playing.  Didn't we just put Jordan Henderson on 100k pounds a week?

Lib Dems might be able to gain in the Highland and Island region if they lost Shetland and Orkney, but the constituencies in Highland and Island swung rather heavily to SNP earlier this month.

null,false,lancerusso,null,null,null,"I'll repeat what tomOhorke said about no east side of Wales- not much interesting beyond Offa's Dyke there. North Wales has a plethora of wonderful castles built by our generous friends the English to suppress us (and a few natively built to keep them out). Conwy Castle is a spectacular example, with an adorable walled town, and nearby is Llandudno, the inspiration to Alice and Wonderland, which is a Victorian seaside resort with a huge limestone premonitory extending into the sea that has an ancient (2000BC) copper mine open for public visits on top of it.
Conwy also contains a stunning example of a 16th century Manor house in the middle of town- Plas Mawr. The town also houses several good eateries and pubs/hotels/bed&amp;breakfasts so is well worth staying there for one evening, I'd say. 

Castle-wise, the best are Caerphilly, Caernarfon, Harlech and Conwy in my opinion. Beaumaris is also pretty good.

Also, with regards to cities, you will find only six. At least half of these are cities due to being hosts to ancient diocesan cathedrals for hundreds of years (almost a thousand iirc).St Asaph and Bangor, in the North (the only northern cities) and the Southern St Davids are such places. St Asaph and St Davids are the two least populated cities in the UK, and both have magnificent cathedrals, though I recommend the latter as a priority. 

And if you happen to pass a rural stone built church on your travels, chances are it's in a place called 'Llan-something', as this is the traditional Welsh naming scheme; Llan is a way of saying 'parish of the church of Saint-something'. Countless minor saints founded these churches and many have seen settlement there since the dark ages, and there's a good chance that a church you visit holds the hidden remains (or often their empty caskets) of some forgotten prince or claimant killed trying to rebel. Many of these bodies were dug up and removed to stop people making them into martyrs by building shrines. A good example is Llywelyn the Great's stone coffin, which now resides in Llanrwst, down the conwy valley, who was initally buried in Aberconwy, and his body has been lost to time.

Coates could work perfectly well, but his positioning and decision making would have to be very good, to make up for his other short comings. Its why I don't particularly like Skrtel, not only he is not athletic, but he often lacks composure in 1v1s and his lack of athleticism means he has to drop deep.

Sakho is far and away our best and most athletic centre back. If you look at this partner for France, Varane who is another oustanding athletic centre back, you can see the template for a good partner for Sakho. Its probably why we bought Ilori, thinking he will become a great athetlic centre back, who on paper suits Rodgers down to the ground. Unfortunately, he's a complete crock and not that good, in my opinion.

After Sakho, in terms of athleticism, its probably Lovren, but he's headless. Sakho and Skrtel are our two best centre backs, but they don't suit each other, and Skrtel doesn't truly suit Rodgers.

you're wrong. this guy, and many others like him, were tried and convicted and punished under british law for quoting the bible in public. its a real thing.

not to even mention that being arrested and let go with a warning, as this guy was:

http://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian.street.preacher.arrested.in.scotland/34071.htm

is suppressing religious speech in and of itself. so is arresting someone for speaking up on your behalf. whether or not these people are eventually convicted is beside the point. its common sense that if you arrest dozens of street preachers for preaching that there are fewer people preaching on the street for some period of time afterwards, not to mention the intimidating effect of being arrrested in the first place.

 That completely leaves out the crowds of people screaming abuse at street preachers, who are not arrested for ""breaching the peace"" the way the preachers in question are. The last time I was in Newcastle I saw quite a few people say some outlandishly awful things to a street preacher. My brother in law preaches in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country and I think he gets treated better there. 

So bringing it back around to the original OP, no the UK is not a Christian nation. UK Christians know this, and so do Christians across the world. African Christians are sending missionaries to the UK now, in fact.

https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home/selling-your-home

&gt; If you sell your home within 10 years of buying it through Right to Buy, you must first offer it to either:

 - your old landlord

 - another social landlord in the area

&gt; The property should be sold at the full market price agreed between you and the landlord.

&gt; If you can’t agree, a district valuer will say how much your home is worth and set the price. You won’t have to pay for their valuation.

&gt; You can sell your home to anyone if the landlord doesn’t agree to buy it within 8 weeks.

&gt; **Paying back your discount**

&gt; You’ll have to pay back some or all of the discount you got if you sell your Right to Buy home within 5 years of buying it.

&gt; You’ll have to pay back all of the discount if you sell within the first year. After that, the total amount you pay back reduces to:

 - 80% of the discount in the second year

 - 60% of the discount in the third year

 - 40% of the discount in the fourth year

 - 20% of the discount in the fifth year

The problem we currently have is that people are buying homes and selling them within a few years to private landlords. Any (percentage of the) discount they pay back is typically small change compared to the rise in house prices.

Many councils either won't buy the homes back, or won't respond to the offer in time, which allows the new owner to sell to anyone. 

What I would propose is that you have to offer it to your original council within the first 25 years. You must wait a minimum of 6 months for the council/your local housing association to respond to your offer. And if you sell within the first 15 years you have to pay back the entire discount - with a scale similar to above for the next 10 years.

In the last four seasons the headcount has exploded from 104 to 169, including a 43 increase in the number of players, managers and coaches from 69 to 112.*

&gt; *Despite relegation the wage bill was only trimmed by £2.6 million (3%) from £78 million to £75.4 million, increasing the wages to turnover ratio from 129% to an almost unimaginable 195%. In other words, QPR spent twice as much on wages as their income – and then had to fund all their other expenditure.*

That is beyond reckless, it's utter chaos.



&gt; *Incredibly, the figure would have been even higher at £250 million if the shareholders had not written-off £60 million and converted £5 million into equity (the maximum permitted by FFP rules) in 2014. Just pause for a moment and consider that: a quarter of a billion debt.*

He might *want* to move to a top four club but which one has a slot for him. Chelsea have Matic (and must fit one from Cesc, Oscar, Willian, Ramires nextdoor); Arsenal are super stacked in midfield: AW clearly prefers Coquelin and is hoping Arteta and Rosicky (who recently signed an extension) can cover until he is ready.

Unless you've been in employment with your employer for at least a couple of years then you've no chance even if you earned enough which you don't.

Our 4-3-3 didn't really work that well during the start of the season, and neither did Markovic. Our only real streak of wins was with the 3-4-3 and that formation was, I thought, a great way to give him some game-time but to keep him out of trouble. 

From that wing back position we didn't ""waste"" an attacking position on someone who didn't play that well (am I the only one who remembers Markovic was shit at the start of the season?). And also, he had some cover around him, playing with Lucas, Henderson and Can.

Sure. Looking back, perhaps Rodgers should have stayed with a 4-3-3 for longer, and maybe we would have seen him grow into the position. After all, it was never fair to expect him to come in and have an immediate impact. But at the time, as I'm sure most of you remember, there was *a lot* of pressure on Rodgers to ""change something"" - everyone had different ideas about what to change. That change was into the 3-4-3 that eventually won us like 10 games in a row, and at the time, everyone thought it was great.

I actually think that playing Markovic at wing back was a stroke of genius. He wasn't playing well and needed time to adjust to the game. He got that time at wing back, and maybe failing at winger would just have broken him.

Yeah we need three signings to retain our PL title while mounting serious challenges on the CL and FA Cup.

All the best teams in the world currently have 3 proven goalscorers with at least one more with decent output. Ofcourse the entire team can pitch in with goals like our defence has shown but I am talking about consistent reliable players in the attacking half of the pitch.


*Barcelona*: Messi, Suarez, Neymar, Rakitic.

*Madrid*: Ronaldo, Benzema, Bale, James.

*Bayern*: Robben, Lewandowski, Muller, Gotze, Ribery.

*Juventus*: Tevez, Morata, Pogba, Vidal.

*Chelsea*: Costa, Hazard, Remy (Terry, Oscar, Drogba all 7 apiece).

Apart from Rakitic, Vidal and Ribery each of these goalscorers has more than 10 goals in all comps this season and in most cases well over that. And we can't rely on Terry scoring 7 goals again next season, those goals are bonuses only SR for Madrid has as many from CB.

**Our needs are obvious.**

**A.**  We need two players to score 10+ goals each next season. Given Jose's belief in Oscar to make the same evolution Hazard did this season and my own opinion that a summer of rest and full pre-season will do wonders for our boy, I think Oscar is ready to step up and score 12-17 goals next season and maintain his form through the season. We are attempting to sign a goalscoring mid either from the wing or through the middle depending on price and availability but I'm also counting on Willian to up his output. Willian is phenomenal all over the pitch for us but has hit the post more than the back of the net this season and must improve his finishing.

**B.**We need a fast CB. I understand Mou's plans in big games won't change overmuch but the presence of a fast quality CB will ensure we can keep a much higher line and still defend comfortably. Terry and Cahill are excellent in defence but their lack of pace means we have to sit deeper since pacy forwards who get in behind would be nigh impossible to stop. With our attacking threat, if we can add pace to our backline with Terry's organisation and brilliant positioning we can ensure more possession, more attacks and larger margins of victory over the top sides.

**C.** We need to sign a third choice striker which is also a dilemma considering a fit Costa has been superb for us and will definitely start and even with his injury troubles, Remy has proven himself a good deputy and scored some vital goals for us. However, he is not without his injury problems and we definitely need a third striker for depth and to add variety and competition for Remy. Zlatan, Lacazette and Icardi are all good fits for that role, though they would all reduce Remy to the third choice striker (not unfairly given their talent and age, respectively). However Zlatan's wages and expected demand to start makes him a bad option. Considering fees and wages, Lacazette would cost upwards of 30 mill and warrant a starting place. Icardi makes the most sense as he's the youngest of these players and should be willing to compete for a starting spot and improve himself under a great coach and great players.

(I do not think we need a fullback currently unless filipe luis leaves. I understand he's had an underwhelming season, both by his own standards and due to Azpi's excellence. But a lot of fans are behaving a bit spoilt due to the impact of Matic, Fab and Costa who all hit the ground running. The fact that Luis didn't especially when he wasn't first choice is NOT an indication of his quality or what he could give us next season, especially with Iva turning 32 soon. He has a chance to bulk up and get a little tougher in the tackle and deserves one more season AT least.)

1) I'd really like your opinions on which goal scoring midfielder would be an ideal signing. Griezzman, Bale, Pogba come to my mind but they seem far fetched ideas maybe apart from Griezzman.

2) Would it be a good option to buy a quality 15-20 goal a season striker and pair him with Costa at times and buy a non-guaranteed goal scoring mid like Imbula, Schneiderlein?
IMO its better for the balance of our team to buy a goal scoring mid/wing and a striker like Icardi to compete for #2 with Remy.

3) Any players we have on loan who have really impressed and you want to be seen given a chance in our first team?
Bertrand Traore for me, hands down although I wouldn't mind Marco Van Ginkel but only if we move Mikel on. 

*Note on BT*: He's brilliant IMO and a future star for sure. He's quick as hell, great acceleration, excellent ball control, outstanding dribbler and he shoots cleanly and crisply. He's got good strength and he's just 19 so he can always bulk up appropriately. He's left footed and can play CF, LW and RW, currently on loan at (yes, you guessed right) Vitesse. I've been following him since his preseason tour with us in 2013, where he was brilliant and I really hope we tie him down to a new deal soon. He's 2 years into a 4 and a half year contract. There was some talk post preseason 2013 that Mou actually wanted him with the team but he didn't get a work permit at the time as a 17 year old. He works extremely hard and has a good engine so obviously Mourinho rates him, but what really impressed me was his tendency to take on his man, and more often than not, beat him and release a quick shot. He scored 8 goals for us in the preseason of 2013 as a 17 year old and I loved his directness and confidence. 

His stats for Vitesse this season are: 25 appearances, 11 goals and 4 assists.",null,0,null,1432649819,null,0,1432650654,0,crlbsks,null,t3_379ps3,null,t1_crlbsks,null,t3_379ps3,null,null,null,1433274346,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

One of them is strategy and BR was incredibly stubborn about some blatantly obvious issues this season. Single striker up front in the start of the season and swapping back to a losing formation at the end comes to my mind at least. Let alone the weird smugness about not needing a defensive coach.

In his defense we had a stupid schedule this season and lousy luck with injuries so it wasnt ideal for the man.

If you are prepared to accept that Liverpool belong at 5th I guess thats your perogative. For me, I remember the days when every team in Europe trembled when we came to town. We were the greatest team in the world bar none. I want those days back and refuse to accept that it is impossible. 

Yes we may be outspent but we can still out think our rivals. We can still make Anfield a fortress. We can still fix our defense without having to spend millions. We can live the spirit of YNWA with our players and show them what it means to enjoy the support of the Liverpool fan-base.

I'll agree with you about Coutinho being paid more anywhere else (and I'd be willing to bet that gets rectified soon), but as for not having a single player over 150k, we don't have a single player WORTH paying over 150k a week.  If Suarez we're still here he'd be worth it.  Gerrard gets in the conversation (though at this point we'd definitely be paying a ""legend tax"").  Other than that... who'd even be in the running?  Skrtel maybe?

You're right that the owners seem to be averse to paying high wages for proven CURRENT talent (instead trying to rely on promising youth talent that will eventually come good), but if you're going to have to sell the promising talent when they do come good (Sterling) then the youth strategy isn't going to work out all that well for us. 

Anyway, we'll agree to disagree.  I love the club and want nothing more than to see them do well, but it's just my personal opinion that Rodgers is incapable of leading us there.  I think (and to preface this statement, I fully admit this is just the ""vibe"" I get from him) that Rodgers has a toxic personality that alienates players.  There's a tier of managers that are so successful and proven that they can dominate players simply by being who they are.  If Guardiola plays you somewhere or tells you to do something you do it because he's Pep God'Damn Guardiola.  If Mourinho does the same thing you know you're being directed by a two time Champions League winner.  If Fergie screams at you you're scared because you've angered a living legend.  But if Brendan ""I kept Swansea up once"" Rodgers insists on playing you as a left back you might just think the guy is fucking mental and holding back your career.  He doesn't have the clout to manage the way he manages.

Is it wrong for people leaving school with zero qualifications to not accept that they're going to have to work for McDonalds or similar? Whether you're happy with the scenario or not, it has no bearing on the fact that it **is** the scenario. If we'd got our shit together 15 years ago we'd be right behind Man Utd, but we didn't and that ship has mostly sailed unless we can slowly catch up over a couple of decades. 

&gt; Liverpool is the 8th most valuable football team in the world.

That'd be great if Champions League was based on revenues rather than regional qualification. It'd be great if we were competing in Italy or France, rather than in the strongest league in the world with four other clubs ahead of us. 

You know who the 19th most valuable club in the world is? Newcastle. 20th? Everton. Where are their places amongst the 32 teams in the Champions League every year? 8 of the top 20 richest clubs in the world are in England. The fact that we're 8th in the world (and last year we were 12th) is as much because we're in the Premier League as it is anything to do with the club. 

&gt; What's wrong with the fans being angry at money being wasted on failed transfers and demanding for a better manager that would attract better talent with the money being spent?

Nothing is wrong with that. Complaining about coming 6th is perfectly acceptable, as to a degree is complaining about transfers that badly flop.

What's wrong is fans that expect that we should be able to consistently outperform clubs with more money than us. It's based on nothing other than this unfounded idea that Liverpool is *special*. That for some reason our scouts and our transfer staff and our manager should be able to do better for less than the clubs we're competing against. Any league finish higher than fifth requires us to be more efficient than the likes of Arsenal or Man City, to pound for pound be better than they are. There's no reason that should actually ever be the case, because to anyone other than a fan of the club, there's not really anything special about LFC.

If we're looking for strikers I'd like us to go for someone like Vietto, who seems to match what we're doing. We won't be able to get *the best*, so we will have to settle for trying to buy someone on the brink of their break through season. Origi, Vietto and Sturridge as choices for the central of three attackers.

I'd like us to bring back either Coates or Ilori as back ups for the defence (and use Skrtel-Sakho as our main pairing) and bring Can up to the midfield as a back up /apprentice for Lucas. 

We also need a central midfielder - Cabaye seems allround enough and seems willing to move as he's not getting game time. Kind of a Gerrard-replacement. Then, for the midfield three we would have Can/Lucas, Allen/Henderson, Coutinho/Cabaye. 

We probably need another fullback as well. I'd go with Moreno as our first choice on the left, and honestly I hope we can see Flanagan back at RB. No, he's not great, but if we're looking at what we should prioritize, our fullbacks aren't the problem. And if we're being honest, it's way worse if your central defender/midfielder is having a 3/10 game than if your right fullback is having a 3/10 game. If we *are* going for a new fullback, maybe Janmaat would be good? Honestly I have no idea.

And a back up keeper. Maybe Neto, or someone who's young but not too young. Like that australian guy? 

So: 
**Buy**: Vietto, Cabaye, Right back, Australian goalkeeper. I don't know, if we can get a really good striker that would be great (Pedro, Lacazette). If we don't, go for Vietto. 

**Sell/ get rid of**: Enrique, Johnson, Kolo, bad players out on loan (Aspas, Alberto), Balotelli, Borini (not sure here), Lambert, Sterling (for like 50 million, to City or Bayern).

That's my five cents on the situation. Maybe we need more players than these but what we really need to do is to turn Markovic, Lallana, Origi and Ibe into first team players. They all seem to have the potential to tear up the league next season.

Unfortunately many players simply won't come here if we offer them 100k to start. We haven't had a player brought in on over 150k since they came in; I'd say that's a trend.

With regards to Sterling, I don't think there's any way we as a club could have done anything to keep him besides guaranteeing him CL. I think it's a bit rich of him to have started showing discontent at a time when we were still in with a shout at 4th, but it's his life. It's what him and Ward have done since that destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him.

He's extremely young and started at a club that had its head up its arse for years. He absolutely gets things wrong, but blaming him for Sterling wanting out just smacks of vilification.

Apart from that, a lot of good advice in this thread, and to add some more:

- Try and find local startups in your area and apply to them.
- Go to any local tech conferences you can find and start networking with the people there. Become a regular
- That nerdy guy/gal at your local pub? Probably works in IT, buy him/her a pint and spark up a conversation
- [Read my articles on AngularJS](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/806029/Getting-started-with-AngularJS-and-ASP-NET-MVC-Par) :) It's a great technology and client-side web development is a very valuable skill at the moment
- Get a StackExchange account and try to answer questions (there are lots of StackExchange sites, pick the one matching the subject area you know the most about and answer questions on it)
- Finally, you need to actively try to get a job. Being passive will get you nowhere slowly.

Your point *does* though. Normally it wouldn't but since the No campaign decided they'd campaign on AV being too expensive it became a question of what price is democracy?

&gt; The ONLY sane reason to hold a recount is if the result is so close that the outcome is in doubt, whether it is FPTT or any other system

So you're saying potential fraud is an insane reason to hold a recount? It doesn't matter if it's one miscounted vote or ten thousand and whatever system is being used. 

&gt; Allowing pointless recounts does not prove it's democratic. If the vote was close, sure, all for it then

What is pointless in this context? Recounts prove it's democratic a lot more than not doing so. Human error does happen and I highly doubt there was malicious activity but it's best to check. Also how do you *know* (not guess, assume or extrapolate) whether or not the vote is close without a recount?

&gt; As I said before, feel free to fundraise or pay for the recount in whatever way you choose, other than being paid for by the tax payer. We pay for enough idiotic things already and I see no same reason to pay for this

Democracy should be available for all. By moving the burden of costs onto the candidate it keeps the poor out of politics (why bother voting if we can fudge the numbers and nobody can challenge it?)

&gt; It's my democratic right to state that this is a ludicrous and pointless waste of time and money and yours to think otherwise. 

That's true. It is also everyone's democratic duty to ensure that the principles which underpin our democracy are upheld fairly otherwise we're little better than the Duma. Recounts, for any margin, is an essential part of maintaining faith in the system.

&gt; The f you can get enough public support then sure - but it's cleat you will not. That's democracy for you.

Is it? I wonder how much public support there would be to robust against electoral fraud. 

Also I notice you barely touched on my question: how much of a price, in pounds and pence, do you put on a recount?

My experience with season 8 is as follows: I felt like Capaldi had a TON of potential, and while he showed little glimmers of brilliance, I feel like the writers were really holding him back. Clara often seems to steal his thunder, and I find myself just begging for Capaldi to break through and be amazing, which I really believe he can do. I also felt like the bad guys were really underwhelming throughout the majority of the season. I thought the mummy was a clever, interesting enemy, and the ""enemy"" in Listen seemed promising until, in my opinion, the end of the episode fell completely flat. But after that, I didn't feel like there were any scary/creepy/interesting/compelling enemies. 

I've seen some people go as far as saying that they are no longer fans and will not continue watching. I won't go that far by any means. If anything, the fact that I believe Capaldi has all the tools to be a truly amazing Doctor if the writers will let him is enough to keep me tuning in. However, I do believe that they need to do a better job of writing in this next season, particularly with the stories/plots. I also think that they need to let Capaldi shine in the episodes and not feel like such an afterthought/secondary character at times. And ultimately, I feel like Clara isn't a particularly good fit with him as a companion. I just don't buy the two of them together. It lacks chemistry or something. I think a new companion would do wonders for this new Doctor.

TLDR: I agree, the season as a whole was pretty bad, but I won't give up on the show yet because Capaldi has potential if the writing improves.",null,0,null,1432652217,null,0,false,0,crld27a,null,t3_3758it,null,t1_crld27a,null,t3_3758it,null,null,null,1433274944,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

A lot of the new players have almost disappeared after our horrible first half of the season which I think is wrong, they should all have gotten proper new chances when the team was playing better. Skrtel, Toure, Johnson, Enrique and Mignolet were also horrible in the first half of the season but Lovren got most of the blame. 

Same with Lambert and Balotelli.. misused and should have gotten a chance to play for a functioning team..

Markovic: Played out of position, struggling for minutes, not even making bench at times..  In the first 3 months he had some very promising sub-appearances but was then consistently benched or not even in the squad for the next 2-3 games for no reason..

Can: Didn't really get a chance untill December because he ""didn't understand Rodgers philosophy yet"", I don't think anyone knew what our philosophy/plan was for those first months.. also played out of position.

Balotelli: Played out of position, imo looked at times like the best player on the pitch in the few minutes he has gotten after December. Can't even get on the bench now..

Lovren: Got a lot of minutes early in the season and was horrible, but so was the rest of our team/defense/goalkeeper. I think our bad defensive form in the start of the season was more down to playing without a DM/formations/tactics than individual players.

Lallana: Injured a lot, but even when he was fit earlier and recently he has been struggling for minutes and often subbed off when he has looked our best player.. But I think injuries and fitness will have to take most of the blame here.

Lambert: Not really gotten a real chance since start of December, and before December the whole team was crap. In October/November Rodgers played Lambert in 7-8 90minute games in a row in 14 days or so, he looked knackered and rightly so at his age. Despite this he started him against Basel and he became sort of a scapegoat since he was too tired to run.

Manquillo: Not being played so Atletico don't take him back I guess? Dissappeared at least, was doing ok..

Edit: Forgot Moreno, he has gotten a lot of minutes but struggled defensively, he was a regular starter in our best period though. 

I know many of the new players can partly blame themselves too, but the point is that such an implementation of new signings doesn't breed confidence for other potential transfer targets or the fans..

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; I already said I don't advocate prison time. The parents should be formally reprimanded, made to do some sort of healthy lifestyle course, and given however long medical experts would recommend to reverse the situation. That doesn't involve handcuffs or jail cells.

I suspect proper monitoring and policing of parenting like this would be very expensive, and that's probably the main reason why we don't do it, we simply don't have the resources. Healthy lifestyle courses and medical experts coming up with diet and exercise plans all sounds very nice, but let's get real here - our social services and the police barely have the resources/powers to take children away from actual abusive parents before their literally murder them, so I really don't think they have the spare resources to go round and check children are getting their 5 a day. 

There's also genuine concerns into how much the state has the right to intervene in family life like this, it clashes with our idea of liberal democracy when you start getting the police involved with telling people how to raise their children. IMO there should be a high threshold before parents allowing their children to live unhealthy lives should become a matter for the police, there are far higher priorities for the police to be dealing with.

&gt; How exactly is the third one not abuse? Are you going to take ""refuse to change eating habits"" from a kid? Fuck no, their dinner is getting changed and they're going to eat it or start losing their social freedoms, pocket money, and games until they do.

Teenagers are notoriously difficult to control and sadly some parents don't put the effort in. But teenagers are also to a some extent responsible for their own actions. If they take it upon themselves to eat unhealthy food then no I wouldn't say this is child abuse as long as the parents are not encouraging it. They don't have complete control over them, and telling your teenage child your going to stop giving them pocket money or allow them to go out because they are too fat certainly has the potential to backfire.

&gt; ""Set in their eating habits"" is also a fucking cop-out. Oh no, my kid likes McDonalds food, I guess he's just doomed to being fat for the rest of his life. Seriously?

Maybe it is a cop-out, but I would say we as a society have decided not to hold parents responsible for the actions of their teenage children in this way. If we did, prosecuting parents for their children getting fat would be way down the list of priorities. First we'd have to make them responsible for the criminal acts of their children, and then for any other disruptive behaviour, and then for their children being victims of crime due to their parents allowing them to be in dangerous situations.

Small lesson for you. A mortgage loan and legal ownership of a property are two separate agreements (although usually inextricably interlinked unless paid off).

Each property has a **title** (also sometimes known as a deed) which gives the **owner** rights to the property. A **mortgage** is a loan secured against a property title. By putting your name on the mortgage loan you take on the debt and are liable for the £65k remaining on the property but *without* any rights of ownership.

What you really want to do is to **transfer ownership** of the property/title into your name but this requires either the mortgage to be paid off (which seems unlikely given the information you posted), the current mortgage lender to agree (unlikely given your income) or a new mortgage to be lined up (unlikely given your income). If you do a transfer ownership it will more than likely still require a solicitor and fees for conveyancing.",null,0,null,1432652687,null,0,false,0,crldbhm,null,t3_378fx1,null,t1_crldbhm,null,t1_crl94i7,null,null,null,1433275065,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

If, and it's a very big if, Benteke is available for around £10-12million - then yes, absolutely, make that happen.

null,false,Galerath,null,null,null,"FWIW I understood your question to be an honest one. 

The issue is really complex. Basically the market is not providing enough housing to meet demand **in certain regions**. There are multiple causes for this.

1: Economic activity is concentrated in certain areas (particularly the South East of England and the North East of Scotland), as a result there is a huge local demand for housing as people move to these regions for work. (By contrast, housing in say... North Wales is basically worthless)

2: Housing companies are sitting on large 'land banks' and only building on the land occassionally. By trickle feeding the market with property they can keep the prices artificially high, and because these housing companies own large tracts of land, it's basically a monopoly/cartel situation where other companies can't suddenly appear and build. 

3) Poor infrastructure. Due to the critically out of date infrastructure in the UK, we can't commute the sort of distances that other countries are capable of. To quote Bill Bryson “If you mention in the pub that you intend to drive from, say, Surrey to Cornwall, a distance that most Americans would happily go to get a taco, your companions will puff their cheeks, look knowingly at each other, and blow out air as if to say, ‘Well, now that’s a bit of a tall order,’” This has a knock on effect with housing - we have to live closer to work than other nations are happy with.

4) Cheap credit. Mortgages are and have been for a while very easy to get and very affordable. This has meant that people have been able to get bigger and bigger mortgages, and as the availability of money to pay meets high demand and short supply, prices have skyrocketed. 

5) External economic factors mean that property is an excellent long-term investment. Basically, pensions are completely worthless these days, the stock market is hugely unreliable, and the return on savings like funds and ISA is pitiful. So what do you invest money in if you have say... £100,000 sitting around? Property. It's a no brainer. This increases demand even more, as investors muscle into the market, pricing people buying a home out of the market in some cases. 

6) Societal expectations. As a nation we've become obsessed with the ideal of owning your own home, even if you're working class. This is actually fairly unusual in Europe. It's far more common on the continent to rent for your entire life, and to take out long term lets (like leasehold sort of things) rather than purchasing. Again, this has increased demand.

7) As a result of the above pressues, for a lot of people their entire wealth is now bound to the value of their house, and the possibility of a comfortable old age is contingent on getting a good price when they sell the family home and downsize to a bungalow to potter about in. This creates a resistence in the market to prices lowering - people *really don't want* to *not* make a profit on their homes. Indeed, they cannot afford to.

That's everything I can think of. I'm sure there are other pressures on the market too. The net result is a tragedy of the commons situation where everyone acting through their own rational self interest is making a worsening crisis in the market.",null,0,null,1432654667,null,0,1432683308,0,crleg4o,null,t3_37be3t,null,t1_crleg4o,null,t1_crlava6,null,null,null,1433275597,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

And bollocks to the home work thing, try telling a 4 year old to 'go read that book' - go do that math, you need to spend time with them doing it, and doing it right..  My eldest will do it on her own (8 now) but you need to check it, go thru it with her and help them create a power point presentation on it (yes really). 

The playdates thing is different, its about networking at school as normally now both sets of parents work so you need to forge relationships with other parents, and that is one way of doing it.. Personally, I'm not fussed. but for some reason women (in people I know) worry more about establishing relationships with other parents..  When we were kids, this kind of happened anyways as the mother usually didn;t work and you lived near to the kids you went to school with.

- A properly elected executive with stringent checks and balances on it's power

- No more major independant positions of power held by people who are appointed. 

- More powers currently held by the Union to be held by the legislature rather than executive bodies

- Measures to ensure higher turn-out come election time. Such as each member electing it's representatives at the same time as its national elections. European elections must be advertised to the public heavily and member states and EU itself should have a responsibility to ensure the public is properly informed of and aware of elections. They quite like that nobody votes or cares what they do. That needs to stop right now.

- Simplifying the EU. No wonder the public can't get enthused about European politics when the entire union is an inpenetrable mess. Every provision of everything has 17 asterisks after it. It's ridiculous. Are normal people really expected to be able to keep up with any of this shit while trying to live their own lives?

For me of the current squad... 

Happy to see leave: Huddlestone, Davies, Livermore, Hernandez, McGregor, Figueroa, Jakupovic, Sagbo, Aluko (a lot of people have said they want to see him stay but he just doesn't do enough for me apart from fall over and win free-kicks).

Would like to stay but might go: Chester, Brady, Jelavic, Dawson (not convinced he'll stay, he dodged the question when directly asked by Burnsy on Radio Humberside), Robertson, Elmo, N'Doye (not sure whether he'd be up for yet another wage cut)

Keep: Rosenior, Bruce, Dudgeon? (is he fit? haven't heard of him in months), Maguire, Meyler, McShane, Ince, Quinn, Harper (apparently looking to finally retire so may leave), Snodgrass, Diame (hopefully they can come back injury-free, but won't attract much interest since they've not played in so long)

A potential squad next season:

GK: Harper, new keeper

DF: McShane, Maguire, Bruce, Dawson(?) Rosenior, Dudgeon, Robertson

MF: Quinn, Meyler, Diame, Snodgrass, Brady(?), Elmohamady(?)

FW: Ince, N'Doye(?)

""At the BBC there's a layer of people who's job is to reject things that are interesting - the trouble is, all those people are all at the top""

To give some context, by 'interesting' he means controversial. Something that is new, that hasn't been discussed/satirised/mocked in the open before for [insert reasons].

Later on, and I think this is bloody spot-on, he suspects that ever since Jimmy Savile, the BBC has basically had it's balls cut off. In the post-Savile world, they can't be controversial, they don't want to take risks. So they want to play it safe and (in Frankies opinion) that is boring.

It's a good interview over-all, I would recommend it to anyone who cares about British comedy, or TV production in general. He also talks a lot about offending people, different types of comedians and Osman pulls no punches with the questions.

Now, there is a team that did use 2 striker in CL that has made it work, in Juventus. Hell, barca bascially has 3 strikers. The difference is that both teams load the middle, no wingers, relying on the backs to provide the width, and have solid backlines. Could we do something similar to Juve with KDB and Silva, maybe like a 4-2-2-2? idk, the defense would really need to improve over the summer and kompany would have to rewrite his form from the past couple of years, plus form a strong partnership with Manga.

Every weekend morning I wake up and have some coffee and throw on the EPL which is on NBC Sports at like 7 am and 10 am to watch some ~~soccer~~ football. I never really had a favorite team and just enjoyed watching the matches. 

I wanted to start following a club but didn't want to pick the obvious top choices of Arsenal, Man U, Man City, Chelsea, etc. Another friend was in the same boat. Obviously being in the USA I don't have any geographical ties to regions or teams across the pond. I saw a team I've never heard of before at the bottom of the table in Leicester and joked with my friend that we should start rooting for them. He was like 'fuck no' they're gonna get relegated at the end of the season....but I kept track of them and started following them. This conversation happened at the very beginning of April. They were the worst team in the EPL. Had 4 wins in 29 games. But I was like 'fuck it, if they get relegated then I'll just have to find someone to root for anyways, I'm riding it out this season'

First game? W vs West Ham. Second game? W vs West Brom. I'm just like oh man this teams clicking or something. I don't know what they were doing wrong before but back to back wins is solid. Game 3? W vs Swansea. WTF is going on? This team is just rattling off wins! 4th game....win vs Burnley and now I'm just mind blown as this team doubled up their wins in 4 weeks since I started following them compared to the previous 29. Then they grab the HT lead vs Chelsea and I just don't know what the hell's going on anymore but then they kind of collapse on the back end of that game....a better opponent obviously. They get right back at it with back to back wins and clean sheets vs Newcastle and Southampton and all of a sudden this team looks like it's going to be safe. A 0-0 draw vs Sunderland seals it and then a final win against QPR at home to end the season. What a wonderful 9 weeks of football. 7-1-1 to end the season and this team won my heart.

I have studied Media (not that it gives me any authority) and have experienced state broadcast in both Italy and the UK. And trust me you want to hold on to the BBC as long as you can. As elitist and patronising as my argument sounds, not everything is about entertainment and free market. 

The BBC is far from perfect and its standards must be upheld and scrutinised, but the day the market, or aggressive politics, will be the sole agents in determining what is important, will be a sad day. 

With this, and were regular TV as we know it die out in favour of hybrid on-demand online content, I am not advocating pumping money into a BBC that nobody watches.

People have had how they 'should' acceptably feel about a lot of things in society made plainly clear to them and they play along on the outside, on the inside its a very different story. 

I've been truly shocked recently about some of the opinions people hold when you really start to grind away the front that many seem to put up to society out of worry for being 'judged' when they express how they 'truly' feel. I'm talking about blatant racism, sexism, incredible xenophobia, hatred of the poor as scroungers, quite an aggressive dislike of progressive equality and a deep rooted fear of technological advances they don't understand fueling a dispensation for refusal towards any kind of progress.

Its annoying when it happens, in dartmoor just pick a tor and walk to it, or a stream, the only thing to be a bit wary of is that it is a bit marshy on the large flat areas, so you can't pitch a tent everywhere, but if you have a couple of spots in mind you'll find somewhere. But as its legal you can pitch your tent without a worry. Also its virtually the darkest place in the UK, so you get some good stars at night.

Without knowing more about your situation I would say it makes more sense to put the money into a stocks and shares ISA than it does a pension.

You could invest in the same funds in a Stocks and Shares ISA as you can in a pension (mostly) and get the same rate of interest without any tax liability whilst not locking your funds away.

There are also other options depending on your level of cash savings and what your aims are, for example, if you are looking to buy a property in future and haven't yet you could use the help to buy ISA that is being introduced later this year:

http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/help-to-buy-ISA

Or if you don't have much in the way of cash savings there are current accounts that offer a high rate of interest in a smaller sum, e.g. nationwide:

http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexdirect/features-and-benefits

But as I say, these would depend on your situation. 

The way I see it though if you are a basic rate tax payer now and will be a basic rate tax payer at retirement if there is no other reason to contribute to your pension (e.g. employer contributions) then there is no real benefit to a pension over a stocks and shares ISA and you are locking your money away for a long period.

Edit: i wouldn't pay any more than 25m personally, but given our need for a top striker who can score, and that the supply of strikers is relatively limited, he wouldn't be a horrible purchase at 30m. i think the team is not far off from being where we want to be...it truly is a couple of signings that offer goals and stability in the middle of the pitch (both cb/cm) that would have given us top 4 this year and will help offer us that next season. what most people don't realize is that benteke is relatively versatile...he plays a hoof and head game at villa somewhat and a more refined game with belgium, surrounded by tons of class players. it's telling that he is the go to striker for belgium and would have been the starter over lukaku by a mile, and still now. anyways, wouldn't be a terrible signing, especially if we can get more quality through the middle of the pitch.

Bayern Capitulated? The only good season we've had under Rodger's was the year Ferguson retired, Bayern losing out to Dortmund is hardly a capitulation like United under Moyes.

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"The ""extrapolate to infinity"" model of the housing market doesn't make much sense either.  When 90% of the people who own property couldn't possibly afford their own house if they had to buy it today, where exactly is this ""demand"" coming from.

The truth is supply-and-demand in the old-fashioned sense is largely a myth, the current housing market is almost entirely a product of speculation.  The impact of actual owner-occupiers is minimal.  (London is worst in this regard, other towns the opposite is true.)  The number of transactions has been in decline for seven or eight years.  Mortgage approvals are less than half what they were.  Remember in the mid-2000s when monthly mortgage approval numbers were presented as proof of a strong market?  Ever wondered why they stopped emphasising them so much?  Take a look at this: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/mortgage-approvals

""Strong demand"" is intended to make you think there's a lot of well-funded homebuyers out there, there isn't.  It's an army of property speculators.

And the key word here is ""speculator"".  Unless there's an infinite number of them, or at least a number of competing speculators with infinite budgets, at some point they'll expect reality to come-up to meet their expectations; they'll want their pay-off.

The ultimate problem, even more than simple sky-high prices, is that the market isn't fit for purpose.  In the London suburbs, a six-bedroom house can go for £2,500,000; sounds a lot, but there are a lot of wealthy people.  You could argue that the top of the London market is actually rational and fairly valued.  That will be a six-bedroom house with a large kitchen, garden, garage, etc.  It'll be a nice house.  You can easily imagine that £2,500,000 is entirely justified.

But, the one-bed flat above the Chicken Cottage on the mainroad 200-yards away will be going for £500,000.  (Obviously the numbers change depending on which borough, but everywhere I've checked has the same, or worse, ratio.  There are still a lot of boroughs with prices half of my example here, which is mostly chosen to make the maths easier!)  And that will be a terrible flat, not even a nice one; tiny kitchen in a corner of the living room, noise from a main road, etc.

So we have a world where the entry-level, in terms of £-per-square-meter for the bottom of the market is more than twice the top of the market.  The key thing is that this wasn't always the case, the bottom of the market has increased in price by a much larger multiple than the top.  Why?  Because speculation, the one-bed flat is the currency; letting larger properties is a bit more complex, and fewer naive people to fleece.

No-one who could afford a £500,000 property would buy such a place to live, they'd buy a larger house in a satellite town, somewhere they could live in for a long time and start a family; not still living above a chicken shop paying the mortgage when they're 60.  And what are the speculators getting for their efforts?  A yield of 3% and a belief that in five years when they want an exit a even richer speculator will buy it for 25% more, even though that would mean a yield of just 2.3%.

It's so thoroughly and completely broken it's not even funny.  You're right that it's not going to change soon, the Tory platform was essentially the one that was the least radical regarding property.  But at the same time, you would be insane to try and join-in with this madness, you have to compete with these invisible sources of infinite cash who for some reason can't find anything else with a higher rate-of-return to put their money into.

To buy the hypothetical £500,000 flat above a chicken shop, you'd need a deposit well into six-figures anyway.  For that amount of cash you could buy a decent sized place in cash in most parts of the world, even other parts of the UK.

Unfortunately, you also know he's going to get absolutely *torched* by speedy attackers, and he just doesn't have the athletic ability to cover up the bonehead moments that his surrounding cast is prone to make. Having Agger and Carra around him for a few years I think might have hid this, and we're now seeing the total Skrtel package. Do I want him gone? Absolutely not. Do I think we need better defense helping around him? Yessir. Because this season, for one reason or another, him compared to the rest of the backs made him look like the fastest kid in the special olympics.

null,false,Krazerxz,null,null,null,"I'm in the same position and as I understand it:

The money you put into the scheme is saved into a Lloyds bank account on your behalf. By signing up to the scheme you're getting stock options. e.g. In 3 years time you have the option to buy as many shares at 423p as your saved money allows. You can take this option, get the shares, which by that time would hopefully be worth more. Or just take the cash.

The worst case scenario is that you just get your money back. If BT goes bust/you leave your job, your money is in a bank account, you should just get it back.

As sharesave comes out of your net pay there is no income tax due. But you will be liable for capital gains tax (depending on how much of your personal allowance you've used).


&gt; Is it financially savvy to invest in this over 3/5 years over other financial investments?

If you don't think you need the money and the alternative would be sticking it in an ISA for 3 years I personally feel it's a good bet. You'll get the benefit of enhanced returns that stocks can offer without the usual risk. Also, If you need to, I believe you can withdraw the money at any time. You obviously won't get to buy any shares, just the cash returned and you won't be able to subscribe to any future sharesave until this term is up.


&gt; What would be a good percentage of my income to invest each month? 

Couldn't and wouldn't want to answer that one. Check the sidebar for guides on what to save for first (i.e. emergency fund).


&gt; Is it easy to sell the shares at the end of the 3/5 year term

I'm in the same position as you so haven't been on the selling end yet. But from what I've read you have a couple of options:

* You can get your money back (not take the option).
* Sell some/all of your shares using the Equinity portal.
* Transfer some/all shares to a personal pension or ISA.

Notably you can buy shares at the option price and then keep them. You aren't mandated to liquidate the shares upon purchasing them at the option price.


Hope that helps. As said by other redditors, this is not financial advice, make sure to read all the terms and conditions and make sure it's right for you.

I agree. Not only did they take the club close to administration, they severely hampered the management of the club, with Rafa bearing the brunt. If Rafa had been backed and allowed to strengthen his squad in the summer of 2009 - in particular to provide cover for Torres - then history may have been very different.

&gt;  it's educational output just wouldn't survive without direct funding, it's cultural pull is incredible and it's training and development is top class. Ex BBC talent is working all over the world at all manner of networks producing top class content. 

And that's mostly because the BBC dominates British television through near-compulsory funding, not because the BBC is the best. 

How do countries like the US manage to train all their people - I'm guessing that they go and work for NBC/ABC/CBS etc rather than the BBC and go from there.

It's like saying that BT trains the most British telecoms technicians, or British Airways trains the most pilots/cabin crew

&gt; The shows you list are the most popular, that it makes to appeal to other sections of the population than yourself. It must be everything to everyone and thus has to make stuff that yes ITV or sky could do, to justify its fees. 

This is the usual tired argument. The fact is that the BBC and ITV are not that far apart. One has ads and one does a couple of things that the other doesn't. I still don't see the justification for spending £150 a year on it when I could spend that on more fulfilling things.

null,false,tom808,null,null,null,"Well I'm moving to the midlands because houses are cheaper there than where I am from so I can only imagine the grim depths you would have to plumb to find cheaper. Also remember that in general wages are proportional to the cost of living so you probably won't actually have more money if you move to a cheaper area.

We are in a similar situation. I'm really keen to get on the housing ladder before I am 30 not because I'm obsessed with owning a place but more because it puts you in such a better financial position if you can buy a house younger and reduce the mortgage down (not throwing money away on rent etc.)

We are going to be sticking to a very tight budget over the next 2 years. We are having one last holiday and then that's it till we can afford a house. The sad reality is that most people I know that own property had it, or a large sum of cash, gifted to them by their relatives. Sad state of affairs in the country these days (particularly the South East).

A couple of ideas I would entertain to up your income and lower your expenses:

Is you job paying you the going rate or are you underpaid? Serious question because a lot of people are too scared to ask for more money from their employer or to move on. I'm underpaid in my job at the moment by about £4k per year (based on other jobs I have applied for). I'm going to make my employer know this with a resignation letter shortly.

Can you reduce your travel costs? Now I did this myself getting a cheaper train into work (it takes about 10 mins each way) and then cycling to my office. This would potentially sound unimaginable for some people but it's saving me about £140 per month. Not to be sniffed at. It's all good exercise too. Some people drive 10 minutes to work in their cars. Some people have over an hour commute on public transport. Remember that it's not entirely crazy to sacrifice some of your time/comfort for a while to save money.

Can you reduce your rent? Seriously ask yourself if you are not going to be staying in the house/flat you are in forever then why do you care how many bedrooms it has/how nice it is? It's not your permanent home and I know we would all like to live someone that's top of the range but sacrifices can be made to get more going into your savings account every month. It's not unheard of for a couple to move in with one of their parents for a year or so (if feasible). That sounds awful doesn't it? Now think about how much you could save on rent every month. Lessens the blow a little.

Your general expenditure. I'm talking about bills food and entertainment here. This category could have a whole Reddit post on its own but in all seriousness when was the last time you sat down, looked at your account and thought ""what did we spend all of our money on this month?""
I know my SO and I can get out grocery bills down to around £40 per week. I track everything we spend money on and the because we live in a flat the council tax/energy bills are pretty reasonable too.
A good stretch is to make sure you have all your bills/Direct Debits come out on 1st of the month (or the day after you both get paid/the bill payer gets paid). Then you chuck what you know you can afford in the savings. The money left should be for food and household stuff only. Possibly around £200 for a couple but that varies wildly.
Have a serious think about where you can make cuts in your budget each month and keep a tight grip on it.

If all else fails you could try and take up the help to buy scheme with as little as £5k deposit. I've seen it done. I'm really skeptical about the H2B scheme personally because you have to budget paying back the money each month as well as the government taking a % of the profit from the sale of your house if you sell it. That in my mind is down right bloody cheeky and as a result I would only consider this as a last resort.

That's about all I can think of/be bothered to type at the moment. I'm on a train on my phone so I apologise for any spelling/grammar errors here!

Good luck!

TL;DR make some sacrifices in your life (even some drastic ones) for maybe 2-3 years and you should be able to get on the ladder eventually.",null,0,null,1432661318,null,0,false,0,crlikw9,null,t3_37chw7,null,t1_crlikw9,null,t3_37chw7,null,null,null,1433277616,null,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6,null
null,false,Frose91,cnty-uk,London,null,"&gt; and yet Ive found the hatred towards people who are obese far greater and I cant understand why

I'm guessing a lot of people are just getting tired of the fat acceptance, the ""real women have curves"" shit, and so on. It's okay to tell a healthy person they are too skinny and suggest they should eat a hamburger, but saying the exact same thing to a fat person is bullying. A healthy normal-sized woman in an advertisement is being called unrealistic these days and obese people demand the advertisement is taken down because they're offended whilst insulting the person in the advertisement by calling her all sorts of ugly things. The problem is that people with anorexia are seen as ill and are being put in hospital, but calling out people with obesity and attempting to help them is for some reason unacceptable because they are not fat but ""curvy"" and offending them is a horrible thing to do, they have more precious feelings than a ""skinny"" person after all. The problem isn't with the disease, it's with how the people who have it behave and with society. If they could start accepting there's a problem, stop being offended because someone is telling them the truth, and stop shitting on smaller women whilst crying because someone hurt their feelings, they'd get a lot less hate. We live in a time where being offended is worse than dying from overeating though, so not enough is being done about it.

With that being said, I personally don't bully or hate obese people and I see it as a very serious problem that needs to be fixed. I think the food companies could do a lot to prevent it from becoming worse and serious action needs to be taken soon or another generation will suffer. Just explaining why they get more hate than anorexic people. I know it's not all of them behaving this way of course, but I'm pretty sure no anorexic people have complained and created a lot of drama about advertising with models bigger than them recently. Also notice how most of the fat-hate goes towards women? It's because the men don't do the whole ""I'm curvy not fat, also I'm healthy and you just offended me"" thing.

I've read the book many times, and listened to the audio book many more, so if anyone was going to be a tough sell for this adaptation, it'd be me. But it won me over, making me feel the same feelings the book gave me in a few scenes -- possibly because the dialogue is almost completely the same. It's pretty amazing how much Childermass sounds *exactly** like I imagined. So, I consider it a pretty huge success, considering the obstacles I had to enjoying this. 

While some changes *did bother me* (one BIG one which I'll elaborate on), others are perfectly understandable. The dry humor was stripped of many scenes, because I imagine it couldn't be conveyed well. A lot of the comedy in the book relies on internal dialogue. 

Among the changes that bothered me, the actor for Norrell comes across as far too assertive for who he's meant to be portraying. Anyone familiar with the books will spot this the moment he takes the screen. it feels a bit like the actor taking liberties for a more compelling on-screen performance, when really the person he's supposed to be portraying is like a banker or librarian. However, he does nail some of the nuance of his character -- namely that he's not only a recluse, he's something of an autistic; socially inept. Both incapable of reading people's social cues and effectively communicating with them. These are mostly comical traits, but it also grounds his character. 

And the big one: they've made a **bold** change to the fairy, to the extent that it may as well be a different character altogether. If you added up the character traits of the book's fairy, you'd get arrogant, conceited, proud, jovial and of course cheerful to the point of sinister. A guy who would just as soon laugh at you as wipe you from the face of the earth. The show's fairy doesn't carry any of those traits. While he is indeed otherworldly, he just comes across as a boomy-voiced bad guy. No more personality nuance, or cheery and politely evil demeanor. Apparently just a straight-up villain. At the least, it'll be interesting to see how they carry that moving forward in certain scenes, since it's by far the biggest change to the fundamentals.

This is unfortunate, because of all the elements of the book, I've always felt his character would be the most interesting to see on-screen, because he's so animated and delightfully evil. Now he's just a dry, boring, evil guy with crazy hair.

Example from the book:
“How long is a life?” he asked. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair spread his hands in a gesture of the utmost candour. 
“How long would you like?”.

From the show: 
“How long is a life?” 
The gentleman asks dead-pan, not looking at Norrell at all: “How long would you like?”

The fact is that the UK entered the EU as one nation, Scotland therefore theoretically, is a region of the EU, not a nation, so we either leave together, or we all stay in. There isn't a situation where one will stay, and the others will go due to how we joined the EU. 

The SNP try and convince people that Scotland is special but in the EU, this rhetoric goes no where, due to how its worked for decades and the fact that the EU really doesn't like Nationalists too much. 

This just feeds into how confusing the EU actually is. The more people cloud the water, the less informed the people will be.

Benteke is a good player for Villa, but he's only been scoring consistently for the last couple of months of this season. He's coming back from an injury, so that may be the reason, but that just puts more doubts on him. 

There are also questions about how he will fit in to our style of play. He's not particularly good at holding on to the ball and playing key passes or pressing the opponents. 

When we play mid-table and lower teams, and this goes for Ings too,  we are expected to win. Those teams concede possession to us and park the bus. Meaning our strikers have less space and time on the ball. Benteke and Ings aren't used to playing against teams like that. And when we play the big clubs, they will be expected to put away the one chance they might get. Playing for Villa and Burnley, missing a sitter against Utd doesn't matter. Do that playing for us and they will be crucified.

I wouldn't be totally against Benteke, for the right price. No more than 20m. He is quick and strong and could adapt to our style given some time.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"Reina had had a poor season or two before BR came in, possibly due to complacency, yes. But there are other issues as to why BR got rid of Reina. One was to get rid of the old guard that supported Rafa so passionately. His first signings were Allen and Borini, familiar faces, allies BR could trust, while he shipped out a number of Rafa's big names, Kuyt e.g.

Plus Reina actually did play for BR for his first season. Mignolet only came for the BR's second season (last year). This is only his second season at LFC and I don't think anyone is overly convinced. 

Back to what I was saying, Reina was shipped off as part of a 'get rid of Rafa's cronies' and 'cut the wage bill' campaign. Only Skrtel and Lucas are now left from any Rafa squad. Reina's behaviour supports the need for BR to get rid of the old guard or he would lose the dressing room before he even had control. 

As for Agger, I think BR was willing to give him the chance to be the ball playing centre back that BR likes but his fitness let him down and it was only logical to get his wages off the bill.

Our landlords work practise was as follows:

1. Don't maintain anything, let it rot. For example, never creosote a fence, let it rot and then charge loads to replace it.
2. Wait until the leaseholders start to pester you to fix it.
3. Charge them to subcontract someone to come out and look at it, to also say it needs fixing.
4. Get your brother in-laws company to go round, do a shit job and then put your own 35% on top. 
5. Sit back and bill them for ground rent every year.

Every 7 years, push to replace the roof. It won't need replacing, but theres bucket loads of cash to make, so its worth a try.

Benteke may be more talented then just a target man but to take those things away will nullify a lot of his threat &amp; Rodgers track record this season doesn't suggest any chance of him changing things to suit Benteke at all.

Just as smoking used to be culturally acceptable, but we generally now shun it as a disgusting habit, the same needs to happen to fast food and whatnot. It's surprising, quite often, how many calories or how much sugar can be in stuff. Have you ever looked at a box of Pringles? Even so-called ""diet"" products often just switch out the sugar for a chemical substance like corn syrup that gets converted to sugar anyway once it hits the bloodstream, which only leads people to believe their eating healthier when they often aren't. It's simply not ethically right.

Also, as is also the case I find with drug or alcohol addiction, treatment often misses the point. It's all well and good to set systems which discourage excessive eating, but it seems like nowhere tackles the very reason people are turning to these ""forbidden comforts"" in the first place. People do not start smoking, begin excessively eating or become a binge drinker for no reason! I used to have an overweight friend who once confided in me that, to put bluntly, eating sweet foods was his only comfort in life. I've also heard others say that they're bored when they overeat. Both of these are issues with the person's life that can be tackled!

I am merely stating that he has all the attributes to become a decent defender for Liverpool. What truly sets you apart from the mean ( I dont quite like the word average as it definitely has negative connotation) premier league player is how consistently you deliver week in week out. At the end of the day that's all matters. Truly world class players have more good games than bad, but its the consistency with which they do the basic things right that really actually matters. If he can improve his mental side of the game, stay fit and do the basic things right week after week, I think we all can agree he would be a very good defender to rotate for a fraction of the cost of a new signing and relatively lower wages. For me that's potential.

 Lallana has only had 3-4 good games for us. Besides that he's been largely invisible in games or missing major chances to score crucial goals. He's not going to improve that much either. He's already 27 and hit his peak. There were much better players available for £25mil, that were much better fits for what we needed. I would compare Lallana to Downing. Decent player that we overpayed for and won't get rid of until 2-3 years, mainly b/c no one will pay close to what we did.

 Allen I would say has shown more value than Lallana. When given a run of games he's shown he can a very good player. It's always been injuries or lack of confidence that forced him out of the squad. At worst I would say he's a squad player, albeit a £15mil squad player. So still an expensive buy.

The others don't have a future at the club. Lovren has been a disaster and up there with one of our worst buys since Carroll. Why was he bought when he's a LCB and our best defender, Sakho, plays there? Lambert was already offered to clubs in January. Borini should have been gone last summer.

null,false,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,null,"Ever since devolution was introduced, Stormont has followed Westminsters lead on welfare. If Westminster puts it up, it goes up in Stormont.

Since the Tories took over in 2010, they have tried to reform the welfare process. 

For example; change DLA and job seekers allowance. In relation to DLA there were new assessments put into place. Oh you're in a wheelchair, but you can work at a desk though right. Oh you've got mental health problems as a result of the troubles, don't worry we think you're fit to work in a kitchen with as little responsibility as possible.

If you are fit to work based on new tests, then your DLA will be reduced or removed.

Job seekers allowance was to be reduced based on your situation. One thing I will agree with the Tories on is that it should always be more profitable to work. There are too many people in the UK who are claiming benefits because it gets them more money than a full time job. The DLA reforms not so much.

If Stormont decides to go it alone and keep the existing welfare rate prior to the Tory government in 2010, they need to find that money from somewhere. Westminster said ""No, you want to keep making the same payments, you find your own money for that.""

That money will be found from Education, Health, DEL, DCAL all the stuff you enjoy because your elected representatives think Northern Ireland should go solo in relation to welfare.

As the parties cannot agree, the DUP could say; ""Fuck it, here Westminster take this power back. It's too much responsibility. We can't manage our own welfare payments"" Then our welfare payments will be made and managed by Westminster instead of the social security agency in Northern Ireland. 

Everyone is happy because the DUP stood their ground and took an executive decision that saves the health and education budget, Sinn Fein are happy because they stood their ground and didn't back down form pressure of the tories or the DUP.

A high rate of interest means your monthly payments on the mortgage are much higher, meant people would spend less money on buying a house because they wouldn't be able to keep up the repayments, meant house prices moved inversely to the base rate of interest.

The problem here is the parties cannot agree on spending the reduced budget or holding out for more money. 
All bills to pass in Stormont require cross party support from Nationalists and Unionists and if they cannot agree then nothing happens.

However we cannot just stop welfare payments altogether and if they cannot come to an agreement then strictly speaking the power returns to the Westminster government and they decide what happens. 

Stormont won't collaspe immediately unless the parties wish it to. The most likely reason would be because parties would not like loosing powers to Westminster and pull out.

:edit: Im not really certain what happens if no agreement is reached to be honest, I can't imagine the executive being disbanded/suspended/collasped. Its possible welfare and only welfare would be (evolved?revolved?) back to the UK government and administered like non devolved issues though not likely. It's possible the Tories would just take over it for a bit, implement their welfare reforms from 2013 that we rejected and then hand it back to Stormont once theyre implemented. It's anybodies guess how the Tories deal with it.

**1) It's not worth doing a loop.**

Categorically wrong. There's loads to do no matter where you are - east, west, north or south. If you're coming here with the express intent of driving around Wales, it would be a shame to miss out on most of the country on the back of some of the advice here.

**2) The roads in eastern Wales are bad.**

Not at all. I frequently drive from Wrexham to South Wales (so A483 - A470 most of the time) and the roads are no worse than the trunk roads through Shropshire and Herefordshire. The only hairy bit, IMO, is the Oswestry bypass - an extremely poorly designed road that should have been a dual carriageway. Very busy, with loads of overtaking (the road is wide enough to be three lanes, so lots of drivers take advantage of the chance to overtake - but that's also what makes it dangerous).

I wouldn't discourage taking the roads through Hereford and Shrewsbury either, though - it's a beautiful route with plenty of interest along its length. But then, so's the road through Newtown and Builth.

Oh, and north to south is four hours if you get a clear run. Three from Wrexham.

**3) Snowdonia is all that's worth seeing in North Wales.**

Nope. 

[Llandudno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llandudno) is the grandest, and probably the finest (possibly excepting Tenby) seaside resort in Wales. Its grand Victorian buildings and pier are shadowed by the bulk of the Great Orme, a headland which thrusts out into the Irish Sea, and which hides some of the largest Bronze Age mines in Europe. The views from the top are spectacular - you can even see the Isle of Man on a good day.

[Llangollen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llangollen) is an absolutely charming town on the banks of the river Dee, which boasts, among other things:

* [The only remaining standard gauge steam railway in Wales](http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/)
* [One of the most spectacularly sited castles in Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell_Dinas_Br%C3%A2n)
* [An excellent example of a medieval Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_Crucis_Abbey)
* [A UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://www.pontcysyllte-aqueduct.co.uk/).

The isle of Anglesey in the north-west is replete with things to see, from [Iron Age burial mounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Celli_Ddu) to [stately homes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plas_Newydd_(Anglesey\)) to [working mills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melin_Llynon,_Llanddeusant) to [manmade moonscapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parys_Mountain) to the [textbook concentric castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumaris_Castle).

Elsewhere in North Wales, there are [grand old houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erddig), [castles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbigh_Castle) upon [castles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhuddlan_Castle) upon [castles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirk_Castle), great walks among the [heather and hillforts](http://www.visitclwydianrange.co.uk/menu/about-the-area/item/heather-and-hillforts/) of the Clwydian Range, and [the most amazing Iron Age hillfort I've ever seen](https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/2373/) on a mountain on the Llyn Peninsula.

What interest rate is your mortgage? I'd be surprised if you wouldn't be better off firstly maxing out your annual pension allowance, then looking at some other tax efficient investments such as VCTs.

I'm assuming you're paying higher rate tax given the numbers casually floated around ;) In which case maxing out the pension allowance for the year would definitely be my first port of call.

I'd then look at VCT and ISA investment. The tax relief on VCTs is generous, but you need to hold for 5 (?) years. There are some quite low risk options out there that should best savings accounts.

Basically I'd hold off on the mortgage personally and invest in areas where you get a preferential tax position. Your mortgage debt will continue to be inflated away by the market and you've got a nice pension lump sum that'll come further down the line which can be used to pay off the remainder if you so wish.

It'll be interesting to see what others suggest. These threads are always fascinating. It's a 'quality problem' to have

Since 2008, a developer requesting planning permission must either build the infrastructure (schools, roads, etc.) themselves or pay for it. So, if a developer wants to build 2000 houses, they will have to build the connecting roads themselves, build a new primary school and some shops, build a bunch of ""affordable housing"" to be sold off below cost price, pay the council to upgrade additional roads/junctions, pay the council for 1/2 a secondary school. This is called a ""section 106"" payment and it can add anything up to £50-100k per house.

The problem is that unless the s106 payment is earmarked for specific development, or the developer builds it themselves - it's up to the council to upgrade the infrastructure.

It's the poor's fault. They cost too much, they spend too much. 

Don't blame the Conservatives who lowered tax revenues via cutting tax. Don't blame them for wages staying the same while money is worth 20% less than it was in 2010, making any tax that is paid worth 20% less in real terms. Definitely don't blame the banks or the ""super rich"" for exploiting the crisis in 2008 and blaming us while more than doubling their wealth.


So... 

* money is worth 20% less than in 2010

* collected money is less due to blanket tax cuts

* banks, corporations and the super rich are doing really well and paying less tax

* The money *(20% worth less than 2010 money, but ignore that)* NI gets from the UK is to be cut by the tories


In short. It's poor people's fault for being too costly so the tories want to cut services and the benefits of ""the poor"". I know you could raise taxes on the extremely rich, even for just a year or two... but that would be unfair. ""the poor"", nurses, firemen, police officers and those people not getting a raise in wealth for five years is fair, so is cutting their services and benefits.

**More concisely.** 

Poorer people = bad, so cut their stuff. 

Richer people = good, so lower their taxes and they might throw a fiver at a poor.

I mean, if the Lib-Dems are sufficiently close to us ideologically that we're not completely selling-out our principles (which if Farron moves the party to the left I don't think we would be), and there's a seat where we're never going to get in (take Frome as an example - the highest we've ever polled there was in 1997 with 16.3%), I think pulling our horse from the race and endorsing the LD candidate makes the most sense - similarly I think that the Lib-Dems could pull-out of some of our key marginals with the Tories and endorse our candidate. What would happen in Lib/Lab marginals, or seats that we genuinely stand a chance of winning in, I don't know, but as a result of FPTP I think not having an agreement would only be doing each other harm.

We didn't accept them in 2013, they just demanded that our welfare budget is reduced by the amount we spent due to not implementing them.

Your budget is actually gonna be even tighter than you think too. Have you accounted for home insurance? Not taking that out can drastically increase your risk, and you often have to have it to have a mortgage. There's maintenance to consider too. If the £200 you mention to your mother also includes food + share of the utility bills that's two obvious expenses you haven't even considered. Council tax is another large expense, I'd estimate between £50 and £100 a month (it depends on area and property band).

Also I hope you want to stay put for at least 10 yrs, or you run a high risk of the market going down and selling the house at a loss. (Your mother is considering taking a large loss over 8 years!). Personally, I think this is too long a commitment at your age.

One with a physical geography focus will look at the environmental and scientific aspects, the impacts, such as sea ice/glacier/ice sheet/permafrost melting, why and how this is happening and how these things impact global (or local) systems, and how change is measured, instrumentation, remote sensing, GCMs etc. 

So I did a PhD in Physical Geography, half in the UK half in Canada, I looked at improving measurements of snow in the Canadian tundra. Climate change is changing the timing of and duration of snow melt in the north, and this is effecting people who live in the north (ice roads etc), the study of how those changes effect the people would be imo a human geography topic, the study of what changes are occurring and why is a physical geography topic.

This situation gives us a moral hard place: we dislike 'big brother' for telling us how to live our lives but rely on the NHS for medical care when we abuse our own bodies. 

In this case I believe it ought to be a criminal act to facilitate such obesity and that the situation should be treated similar to parole - with regular contact with a local medical centre that can monitor weight and *will* arrest those caring for the child if weight continues to rise un-checked (this limit would be on a case by case basis advised by medical staff but with a goal of reducing the persons body weight in realistic stages). 

The net result is a forced monitoring of weight in extreme cases along with re-education and a penalty incentive for not taking adequate care. 

That's not *nice* but on the other hand neither is allowing your child or yourself to rocket in weight, causing medical problems down the line which could otherwise be avoided.

If Toure's off the pitch influence was that good, you'd think he might have been a help to our players in situations where help was needed this season but he wasn't.

If Toure was a help on the pitch, then for his performance in the Bernabeu, I can give you examples of him being a disaster at the back, most recently the game against Arsenal in the Emirates this season.

Sakho and Skrtel would look good with a manager who cares about defensive organisation, Lovern, I don't rate much but in a team with a better shape would look better. The fourth spot should be for a player like Illori or Coates who between them, we spent 15m pounds on and neither got any chance to play for the team.

If you want to add experience and winning mentality to the team, then we should be smart. Signing old players who will add up to the team is not smart. Signing Milner is adding winning mentality to the team but just Milner alone won't change anything, if we can somehow add Khedira and Pedro (I know won't happen) then we wouldn't spend much money and we'd have players who won the World cup, CL, La Liga and Copa del Rey for peanuts.

If anything, starting off the censorship in an easy-to-bypass format is a good way to breed apathy and complacency among the opposing public. 

Once the dust settles and everyone accepts censorship because it's either easy to bypass or become the norm, then they start quietly ramping up the implementation. 

GCHQ are caching every solitary data packet that's going in and out of the UK by mirroring the fibre optic backbones. And that's just the program we know about. The technology that the government has at its disposal here is staggering.

If they're not running a solid method for censorship it's because they don't want to, not yet. Not because they can't.

True - but it shifts the burden of the taxation towards the problematic behaviour it's self.

Petitions aren't going to do anything, there's simply not enough people to protest for them to care. It'll require more than 5,000 signatures for the government to accept that. But I'll be damned if there's nothing we can do about that. 

We, as a people, must unite. We have to let them know that we will not tolerate this bullshit any longer. We have to let them know that spying on us is an invasion of our human rights which they're trying to abolish. 

The BBC has to be fair about news coverage, they cannot emphasise exactly how serious the nature of this removal of our rights is. We have to spread the message, be it via Facebook, Twitter, or even shouting it on the streets. 

What I'm trying to say is that we as a people can bring change. And I don't mean a revolution or anything - just simply stopping the clear invasion of our privacy. I feel that if enough people actually understood the gravity of what they're doing, the Tories will be forced to stop.

Could be they were truly socialist, communist, anarchist, etc. Could be they saw the lesser of two evils and felt compelled to fight, could be they just wanted something to fight for, could be they saw British and French appeasement in the SCW as truly cowardly and a prelude of things to come [as I do with hindsight] and just felt they should be involved in something.

In a lot of cases though, especially with these fat acceptance movements, even pointing out that it isn't healthy and trying to educate them is seen as offensive. Not in a rude way of course, but pointing out that fat isn't the problem but sugar is for example. There's a lot of sugar in most ""light"" products, and many people think that these products are healthy. Education is what a lot of these people need. (Not talking about the people who have gained weight for medical reasons.)

It's the more extreme fat acceptance movements and ""curvy"" women that make it into the tabloids, almost promoting being unhealthy or protesting advertisements with healthy sized people, or way too often using the term ""real women"". Anorexic people however get more stories on how they recovered and are feeling much better now. That's why obese people get more hate. Not because they are all evil, but because some very loud people and movements give all of them a bad name by insulting everyone else and promoting an unhealthy lifestyle.

You'll never hear me say that bullying is the right thing to do, but to the question of why obese people get more hate than anorexic people the answer is simple: The media is full of obese people with big mouths insulting healthy people in order to make themselves feel better and people are getting tired of it.
