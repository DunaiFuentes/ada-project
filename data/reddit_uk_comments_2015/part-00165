Think of what we have here. ANYBODY whether rich or poor can get treatment for nearly any disease. Even if you have never worked a day in your life you will be saved. If your parents are poor and you develop a disease when you are a child you will be treated.

Of course we moan about delays and sometimes the service isn't as good as it should be but quite frankly it does a remarkable job. You will not find 1 person in this country who does not owe something to the NHS. From the Prime Minister to the bloke down my road who works at McDonalds, we have all benefited from the NHS.

You're right, most people don't have another option. THAT'S THE POINT. Think of the 44,000 people who  needlessly die every year in the U.S because they cannot afford health insurance. Healthcare is expensive as fuck. Treating cancer can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, most people cannot afford that. But we have created a system where people can and are saved.

Why do we treat it as a religion? Because it is a healthcare system that is by the people and FOR the people. Everybody mucks in to pay for it and everybody rewards from it. One of the few things that unifies us in this country is our admiration for the NHS. Humans aren't born with the God given right to be treated for diseases but here in this country we have made it a right to be treated.

We don't live in a perfect country.

Thing is, the developers explicitly had their application to be allowed to demolish the building rejected. And they demolished it anyway.

Plus, the building was about to be listed, and the developers rushed to demolish it quickly because they knew it was bout to be listed.

Plus, part of its historic value was that it had been the only building in the street left standing after the Blitz.

Plus, because they demolished it furtively, they destroyed everything inside too, when it could be saved.

Plus, by demolishing it without any approvals, they didn't adhere to any of the safety criteria, and could have endangered surrounding buildings.

&gt;If the Telegraph are trying to use this to say ohhhh scary evil state

? It seems pretty clear that the Telegraph is sympathizing with those who wanted to keep the building here. If anything, it's siding with the outrage against the developers.

null,false,koptimism,lfc99,,null,"&gt; It seems like our very naive plan was to pray that Studge would be injury free, and that our backup strikers we intended to have zero in common with our main forward, y'know?

No, the club's not that stupid. We went after Sanchez and Remy, remember? Both of whom would've been perfect, offering the same type of movement as Sturridge.

&gt; then why the hell are they in our squad?

Balotelli - the committee fucked up. It's honestly that simple. It was August 3rd when we pulled out of the Remy transfer; that's getting quite late in the window, yeah, but for them to turn to Rodgers and say ""you can have Balotelli or Eto'o"", neither of whom fit what we were trying to do, is unacceptable.

The knock-on effect is that the Balotelli signing makes the Lambert signing useless. Lambert was signed as the ""Plan B"", to offer an aerial presence and hold-up play to help against packed defences. It has worked on occasion, too - in the first game of the season, it's Lambert's aerial threat, drawing Southampton defenders towards him, that frees up space for Sturridge to score the winner.

Problem is, Balotelli is that exact profile of striker, and is ""potentially"" better at it. So, instead of having 2 Plan A strikers and 1 Plan B, we end up with 1 Plan A striker and 2 Plan B's, and suddenly Lambert becomes redundant.",null,0,null,1430581096,null,0,false,0,cqw354b,null,t3_34lo4s,null,t1_cqw354b,null,t1_cqvvsv6,null,null,null,1432731332,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

To explain the twitter links on his websites; the twitter address did originally belong to him, but he closed it down early this year so someone has jumped on the opportunity to revive the twitter handle. (He realises now he should have kept in and just left it inactive to avoid something like this)

Plus Dave, Zouma, and Hazard all were bought recently from the French league. In my opinion success in the french league translates well to the prem.

null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"No. An election is not the time to ""communicate disagreement with the political system""; the sole purpose of an election is to choose a new government. Your job at an election is to pick the party that you feel would best serve the country in government. Whether you like it or not, one of those parties *will* form the government, either on their own or part of a coalition. No matter how many people vote for ""none of the above"", ""none of the above"" can never form a government. Anyone can stand for election, and if you truly can't make a choice between those that have, then the answer is to stand for election yourself. And that brings me on to my second point...

I really can't take anyone seriously who claims that ""they're all the same as each other"" and that they ""don't want any of them"". If you think that they're all the same, then you haven't engaged with politics enough. They're not all the same, and whilst differences in policy in certain areas may be small, those policies only come about because they have the support of a large number of the electorate. And however similar you think that they are, you've still got to pick one. Fine, you don't particularly *want* any of them in government, but as long as there's a choice at all, you must form a preference. Call it the ""least worst"" option if you like.

This ""voter apathy"" phrase that people keep trundling out when discussing this topic really irritates me. It's not anyone's ""job"" to make politics ""interesting"". If you don't care about politics then that's your problem. I don't care if people don't care about politics, and I don't care if they don't vote either. Not voting is, as far as I'm concerned, a perfectly reasonable position to take. But what annoys me is when people blame politicians or ""the system"" for not making politics interesting enough for them.

It probably doesn't count for much and I'm getting a lot of scepticism from people regardless of what I say but!!! He's actually my father, and while I don't personally support UKIP I can tell you with 100% truth that these tweets were not made by him. My dad is actually ex-army (and if you go onto his facebook page his cover image is of him doing the commando course) he has nothing but respect for the gurkhas and it breaks his heart that he's being accused of such awful things.

To explain the twitter links on his websites; the twitter address did originally belong to him, but he closed it down early this year so someone has jumped on the opportunity to revive the twitter handle. (He realises now he should have kept in and just left it inactive to avoid something like this)

I've had to deal with reading gross comments involving death threats directed at my father across the web which is really hurting me (and I can't imagine how the rest of my family are feeling; I'm currently at university so I've not been able to see how it's affecting them). Of course people still don't believe it since these excuses have been used before by others which is unfortunate but hopefully soon there will be some good evidence that can satisfy people.

Commentators are like us more often than not they are wrong time and time again. 

&gt;Id STILL rather have torres, especially with our style of play now/compared to in his time here with our famous 'defensive shell'.

We still have a defensive shell. And have used it even more so when all the other strikers got injured. And Torres would never be a third choice striker.

&gt;I mean think about it, we bought a player who came up in laLiga/barclays for getting behind the best defenses in england, and then hes bought to and sold to the most defensive side in england an suddenly everyone wondered why he struggled to score

It had a lot to do with age and injury. He had Hazard and Mata. It's not like we lacked an attacking team. 

&gt;although Suarez years on, with torres' old team, puts up a bomb shell of goals. when you look at the bigger picture, its not all that complicated 

When you look at the big picture your are missing half the page. Suarez is younger and hasn't blown out his knee. He still has pace in his game.

Every game I am less impressed with Sterling, however. So many attempted dribbles and crosses and so few successful ones.

I don't know what is going on in his head, but he needs to have some kind of reset. He is so much more effective when he uses his dribbling talents as an impact setting rather than a default, the defenders know exactly what to do. No one is going to fear you as an attacking threat if you do the same thing every time.

I think the reason why Cuadrado hasn't been successful yet is I think he's a bit taken aback by how aggressive PL defenders are.

Lovren, Skrtel, Can, Hendo, Lallana, Coutinho, Lambert and Gerrard all good. Even Glen had a better game.  

The pressing ability we have with Lallana, Henderson, Coutinho and Sterling is phenomenal. It the complete reverse to the pressure we've been putting ourselves under in recent games where we just haven't been able to do it. Hunting in packs but being successful at it was good to see as that's where we're dangerous - without that, teams are able to set themselves and that's when we've seen Sterling and Ibe running to the by-line and losing possession in the past couple of matches.  

Lambert &gt; Balotelli, not necessarily in terms of workrate but he was able to do the simple things well. Bit more of a team player also which I think led to the goal when he decided to pass where others might not have (this isn't a sly jab at Balotelli, I don't think Sturridge or Borini would've squared it either).  

Apart from the pressing game, Sterling was poor. Nothing else really to say about him.  

Gerrard was almost a passenger in the game which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Due to our successful pressing, QPR couldn't break the first line and Gerrard wasn't called into too much action leaving him free to spray passes or carry the ball. This isn't to say that he should be starting every game though, QPR are probably one of the only teams in the league that would allow him to have a game like that. Glad he got the winning goal as well.

Schneiderlin's composure is so missed. I don't like Toby in the midfield. On defense he tends to drop too deep and left a body open at the top of the box a couple of times. I think we got rattled early on and it's unfortunate we can't pull ourselves back together when that happens. 

Feel bad for JWP. I really feel like he's on an upward path and this kind of mental and emotional setback is unfortunate. Hopefully he can brush it off. Really thought he was playing okay, at least compared to some others. 

Pelle is only good when he has good delivery, and he wasn't getting it today. 

Glad Long came off at the half, in fact I thought Djuricic looked like the best player on the pitch for the whole second half. Was fairly composed on the ball, and created a couple opportunities with good positioning and movement. Unfortunately a few bad through ball attempts as well though. I hope we hold onto him for next season.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"It's a question of depth in that position. It's also a question of which formation is Rodger's preference.  

At the start of the season I'm sure he thought we'd have plenty of depth in the left and right back positions with Johnson, Manquillo, Enrique, Flanagan and Moreno all there or thereabouts. But things haven't really gone our way and we're left with Johnson, Moreno and Manquillo (who seems to have died). And so it might have been that Rodgers has gone with 3 at the back to negate the need for out and out right and left backs.  

This isn't ideal for either defenders of attackers but with time and perseverance we've been able to create a fairly successful formation with it which also offers adequate cover for each position (being able to interchange Moreno or Johnson with Ibe, Marko, Sterling). We have plenty of depth at CB so we can afford to play with an extra one.  

I don't know. People say that the manager is playing players out of position, but perhaps the formation is dictated by the players we have available? In reality, it's probably a bit of both but I don't think it's as black and white as Rodgers deliberately playing players out of position for no apparent reason.  

Edit: Take Moreno's injury for example. We now only have Johnson and Manquillo. If it happened that we only had 1 fit RB or LB you have 3(ish) options:  
1. Would you rather be forced to play Marko/Ibe etc. at LB/RB, deliberately out of position due to necessity or,

I think he's been overplayed as our other wing options, namely Markovic and Lallana, are either not at the required level or haven't been fit enough. If we get Depay next season we'll see better management of Sterling and hopefully a more consistent output from him.

This contract drama has all been blown out of proportion - obviously from media excerpts it seems like he's got the club in a chokehold but I'll see what he does in the summer before judging him. I don't expect him to stay here for his whole career, but for the foreseeable future this is definitely the best place for him to grow and I'd like to think he acknowledges that. 

He's our club top scorer at 20, and Rodgers has played him at wingback during the season.

I definitely agree, but the exodus is also going to create another huge problem whatever the finances say. You can use the kids to supplement some of the positions, but as it stands we'll have no strikers. Sandro as the lone midfielder (if he stays), as I think Fer will find another club no problem. Traoré and Hoilett as the only options down the left (and I'm lost patience with both of them, especially Hoilett who is mugging us off for a lot of money). Nothing down the right as I'd put money on Phillips leaving. Finally, no right back. So right off the bat we need five or six starting players just to kick off a match.

Les walked into a house on fire with all the shit Fernandes, Hughes, Redknapp and Beard lumbered the club with, and obviously hasn't been able to put it out, so perhaps now that it will burn itself out this summer this is the time for him to prove himself. I'm not sure he can do it alone though, and as you say, having a manager like McLaren or Allardyce to work with might be that much more effective as they've got their own connections to tap in the game.

I know that won't get me upvotes and I know that I would sound like a nicer person if I feigned outrage - but it would also make me a hypocrite.  Because I've enjoyed far crueler jokes from comedians, e.g. Joan Rivers - who joked about 9-11 widows and Bill Hicks - who fantasized about Jay Leno blowing his brains out.  

I accept that it can be subtle.  Some people really do try to use the 'I was only joking' line as an excuse for bigotry.

This is actually quite an interesting poll, because like Ashcroft's constituency polls, it asked a supplementary question asking respondents to consider their voting intention taking into account the situation in their own constituencies. Therefore you could reasonably expect considerations like tactical voting and the popularity of incumbent MPs to be reflected in people's responses. Here are the results to that second question:

* LAB: 37%
* CON: 25%
* PC: 15%
* UKIP: 12%
* LD: 7%
* GRN: 2%

Encouraging numbers for Plaid, therefore - if they manage to reach 15%, that would be their highest ever vote share in a general election.

No evidence to suggest that it's the royal family bringing in the money. The charades outside Buckingham could continue without them, and *that's* what people actually see. It would lessen the cost to the Met, which was valued at some tens of millions a year to merely protect the royals doing their thing (and not even Royals like the Queen who arguably do a cracking job as ambassador-in-chief, but ones like Beatrice (whose father used to insist on helicopters and guards for them) who serve no discernible point but to exist). Heck, even Andrew cost in one year £1m to the Met alone.

I'm not sure which they'd use between pounds and grams/kilograms, but I use pounds for just judging mentally and g/kg for most things from the shops just because that's what's on the label. I'm awful at judging weight and try to avoid it so I probably do use g/kg more. Definitely stone over kg for your own weight, and I never hear anyone use metric for distance except in an academic context. We would definitely use metric for volume though (except pints in the pub), fl. oz is the most annoying measurement I've ever heard of.

I think Europa is the aim next season, and I'm sure thats how Monk is going to keep hold of his players. If we end the season on good form, like currently, players won't want to leave in the summer. 

I'm not sure with Dyer, it seems all he has going for him is pace, and even then Barrow matches that and can keep going for longer and arguably has more drive. I think we'll look to pick up a first team winger to replace Dyer and have him as back up, but then again, having Dyer and Routledge as back ups is a bit upsetting considering they've both been good to our club.

I've never known a keeper to just dive out of the way of shots and refuse to make himself 'big' as Howard has over the years. He has by far the worst percentage of shots on target leading to goals of any keeper in the PL this year, I think it's at 55% and they had 4 shots on target and 3 goals today. Cleverley's goal is the epitome of this as he's already on the ground before he's even hit it. Fair enough it's a nice finish but if he makes himself big and stands up he's got a chance to not be beaten at the near post.

The French government is the main driver of the economy - nearly 60% - as a result of high tax and spend culture. The government is facing up to the fact that it has to cut spending because government departments are bloated and inefficient, and that is not going to be good for the economy. 

Young people just can't get jobs - or start businesses - due to the high protectionist nature of the work place and red tape. That's why there is a sizeable contingent of French-run start ups in London and a lot of young, highly-educated Sciences Po type French professionals in The City.

I'm out near the equator atm so wondering if ill see any **new freckles** even though I've been applying **spf 50 broadspectrum** reguarly and wearing a sun hat.  I have a degree of **SF purging** but I expect it being in a place where I'm sweating a lot more than usual. Shame  I'm only here for 1 week. .. Usually after 3 weeks my skin clears up.  

I kinda followed **Lisa Eldriges thing skincare thing about long haul flights** and did my hydrating/ locking in night routine twice during the flight. Then did a IIRC **moisturising sheet mask during my layover** and a **hydrochloric acid sheet mask** when I got to Thailand. **Not a flake in sight**. Also in that adapted night routine I added a **Lionel V sleeping pack** sample sachet at the end. Can't say 100% if any of those are contribute to my hot weather purge but I don't believe so. I will look into getting  a tube of thr sleeping pack for when the UK changes from summer to autum which is when my skin tends to get dry patches. 

I have the tiniest bit of **peeling on my nose** which I'm pretty frustrated about as I've been replying **Biore Water SPF 50** reguarly and wearing a wide hat and walking on the shade and avoiding midday sun But the skin isn't red nor tender so I think it's reasonable.  

I'm thinking I might use the **physical sunscreen at night** when I'm back home for the **PIH** especially till I see a derm and discuss including AHA/ BHA I to my adapalene routine. 

I kinda wanted to buy everything I saw out here but reeled myself in and figured if it wasn't on my list then I'd be okay with paying a bit more to jave it mailed to the UK after talking with an nhs derm. I figured ill start back the adapalene 2 days after I get back to the UK so I can do not her face sheet without my face being all WTF flaking and stuff.  Use of the biore water essence for days I want to limit the 'dewy look' and regular broad spectrum the rest of the time. Im thinking about an adapalene routine that takes a break once a month so I can thread my upper lip and use a sheet mask will ask a pharmacist once I get back. I may have bought 25282854646392 here XD

I think one of the biggest most consistent things that irks me about my skin are dark under eye circles and whilst using make up corrector does even them out a lot I'd prefer a preventative approach... so no more super late night gaming! I think this will be my next area of research. 

My other concern is acne which has reduced significantly since I've been water/ Co washing/ bending forward in the shower when washing my hair and thoroughly wiping and rinsing off my back in the shower. In the immediate short term I'm going to use up the broad spectrum spf I have there to reduce PIH and then when I see a derm ask about using the adapale there.

From what has been shown so far I don't think he can work well in tight spaces. And so has space closes he doesn't know what to do with the ball. It gets nicked way to quickly. 

&gt;I think the reason why Cuadrado hasn't been successful yet is I think he's a bit taken aback by how aggressive PL defenders are. They just don't let you have time on the ball

This is the man reason I don't think he will make it. I don't think he processes information fast enough to make it in the PL.  Of course he could adjust and I hope he does.


&gt;He also needs to hit the gym a little bit, he's been bullied off the ball a lot. But both of those things are correctable, and I think given an offseason to train and more match experience, he'll be our starting RW next year IMO. 

The chance of him knocking Willian out of the starting spot is slim. This starting line up just won the PL. Why do you think someone will be benched so quickly?

Not only that, but due to the fact that your gangs are now banding together to attack the cops. it obviously doesn't look too pretty from our point of view, does it?

It's high time it came to a head though. the Police in your country are viewed as sociopathic, power tripping psycopaths.
Have you heard any of this before?

You effectively now have a standing army, since your police were heavily militarized in the early 90's. 

This creates the feeling of threat and hostility from your own government, and as far as I'm aware, you are taught to obey anyone in uniform. It's like the police treat you all as children, and you obey without question. That is very dangerous, and your social situation highlights this almost constantly.

You see, in England we don't respect authority, we respect PEOPLE.

Not only that, but we only respect people who are respectfull of others.

We also respect law, but that is considered secondary to people and humanity.

The problem is that your ""authorities"" are usually waving a fire-arm in your face whilst demanding respect and ""compliance"". 

Compliance is forced, it's effectivley the complete REMOVAL of free wiil. which is obviously 100% incompatable with ""freedom"".

You came on here basically asking if there were any other sources of free money available to you due to some sort of fuck up with your benefits, although I'm not certain I am pretty sure the answer is no. Other more knowledgable people may advise otherwise. 

However, the point I was making was this - you are probably still young enough to turn your life around. The fastest way for you to never worry about money ever again is to prioritize getting a job above all else, not scrabbling around in the dirt for non-existent emergency loans. If you can say hand on heart that you have done everything you possibly can in your life to find a way to earn a decent living instead of watching state benefits being handed over to your landlord in your name whilst you sit around at home enjoying yourself, then screw me for being wrong. I'm not looking down my nose at you because I think that you aren't all that different from me - I am lazy, pretty selfish, prone to self pity. I categorize myself as one of life's failures actually and have made many errors, financial and otherwise but if I was in your shoes right now, I literally wouldn't have time to do anything other than fill out job applications or setting up my own business or whatever. 

All that said, if you have the means and are relaxed enough about your situation to be playing Counter Strike or whatever, maybe you were just exaggerating your current crisis and it will all blow over, your benefits will come through before your landlord realizes what is going on and you can keep on doing what you're doing for a while longer but you are only delaying the inevitable. Good luck whatever.

Kettling has been used in England on occasions, but without mass beatings.

And generally most protests here go peafully and without major incidents.

I'm not saying it's your fault, and to be honest, I'm not even sure how to advise you on it.
I have never seen such extreamist behaviour from goverment employees.
It's so easy to critisize, but much more difficult to offer a solution.

To be quite honest with you, it actually shocks me quite badly.
Obviously I have seen some of the videos on youtube, and yeah, their not pretty!

I really don't know what you can to do about it.

I actually think this would lead to civil war in many other countries, but since your military is so well equipt, I don't even think civil war will help you!

Bullshit. 1995 the crime rate was double what it is now (and NO it's not down to crime not being reported). Literacy rates were in the low 70's it's now 99%. Child poverty was 30% it's now 20%. in 1990 there was no gay marriage, gays in the armed forces, no equality act, in 1980 it was still illegal to have gay sex in a hotel. Disabled rights, child vaccinations, race relations, access to education, oversees flights, decent clothing, infant mortality, reduction in global war, road deaths, violent crime. It's easy to be critic.

&gt; The history of humanity proves you wrong.

The history of humanity is something you're ignorant about then:

1930: Satyagraha - India
1954: Hawai Peace Change
1968: The Prague Spring
1974: The Carnation Revolution in Portugal
1979: The Iranian Revolution
1986: People Power Revolution
1987: The Singing Revolution - Estonia
1989: Eastern Bloc regime changes
1989: the Gentle Revolution - Czechoslovakia
1989: Germany regime change
1990: The Golaniad Romania
1990: The Mongolian Revolution
2000: The Bulldozer Revolution
2004: The Orange Revolution in Ukraine
2005: Cedar Revolution in Lebanon

This isn't evan a complete list - so read a book before you trump out your horse shit about murdering people.

&gt; The difference between North Korea and the UK is one of overtness.

You just attempted to compare the UK to North Korea. That in itself is idiotic.

&gt; Replay history yourself the anti Iraq war riots what if it turned violent? History would be different.

No shit sherlock. Things happening effect stuff. Well done.

&gt; So what will happen on May 8th NOTHING. Business as usual....

You don't vote in a new government and all of a sudden things change. You're not THAT naive.

&gt;What threat is there to an MP today?

Nothing when a generation of naive keyboard warriors sit behind their computers all day long and whine like pussies about how powerless they are with barely more than a GCSE understanding of history.

If he does a basic check it won't show any spent convictions on it, only unspent ones.


A standard check shows all unspent convictions


An enhanced check shows all convictions regardless of being spent and has, if I remember cautions and fines too, an enhanced check has a lot of info about you on it and can have even comments regarding your behaviour with the police on it. I think that might have changed recently to be less revealing, because if you haven been stopped by police and not have been charged there is no need for anyone to know.

Basic is just for normal jobs, standard can be for like some roles in the Military and enhanced is for people working with children or adults.

As far as I know not every employer can just request an enhanced or standard, I think he needs to prove why he'd need that type of check otherwise he could discriminate you based on spent convictions.

And I almost certain you can go down to your local police and put a request in for a check on yourself for £15, it'll be enhanced and have extra info. And an employer will always need your signature to get a background check on you.

Also England has much shorter wait times for your convictions to become spent.

&gt;The BBC is required by law to adopt a code of practice at each election to govern the participation of candidates in each constituency or electoral area.  In doing so, the BBC is required to ""have regard to any views expressed by the Electoral Commission"".

&gt;Election and referendum guidelines for TV, radio and online coverage, including message boards, will be drawn up by Chief Adviser Politics, agreed by the BBC Trust and published before each campaign. 

&gt;10.4.20

&gt;On polling day the BBC, in common with other broadcasters, will cease to report campaigns from 06.00 until the polls close.  Coverage will be restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather.  Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign, or other controversial matters relating to the election, must not receive coverage on polling day, **to ensure that nothing in the BBC's output can be construed as influencing the ballot while the polls are open.**",null,0,null,1430596141,null,0,false,0,cqwasz9,null,t3_34lznx,null,t1_cqwasz9,null,t1_cqw53qy,null,null,null,1432735013,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Leetenghui,null,null,null,"&gt; Bullshit. 1995 the crime rate was double what it is now (and NO it's not down to crime not being reported). 

I.e it is crime simply not being reported and police simply fiddle the figures:

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/12/police-officers-fiddling-crime-statistics-england-wales-figures

The old GOLD standard of the British Crime survey understates crime by 50% by not recording more than X numbers of crime per person. I remember when the crime maps came out. I was mugged had my motorbike stolen (dragged off it) and my sister was nearly car jacked (they grabbed her purse) these crimes did not show up on the crime map. That is why I have little faith in the government figures.


&gt;Literacy rates were in the low 70's it's now 99%. 

Sure by falsifying the stats, go look at the Wolf Report for how individuals came out of college illiterate yet still got A-levels. Note how the government changed it from absolute illiteracy to functionally illiterate. Even 2011 figures suggest 5.2 million adults are illiterate. So by that measure it is 92% literacy rate not 99%. The very fact my job exists proves there is a considerable literacy problem as I sometimes work with charities to promote reading and writing.

&gt;Child poverty was 30% it's now 20%. 

Not read the IFS report? Child poverty is expected to increase by 39% in 2020.

&gt;in 1990 there was no gay marriage, gays in the armed forces, 

&gt;no equality act

Both of which are circumvented and therefore might as well not exist.

&gt;in 1980 it was still illegal to have gay sex in a hotel. 

&gt;Disabled rights, 

As above circumvented at any opportunity.

&gt;child vaccinations, 

&gt;race relations, 

Which changed nothing all that happens is stealth racism non white name? You get discriminated against.

http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/woman-hits-out-at-car-insurance-1165843 We're not racist we don't charge people more based on race! Except we can provide no explanation for this! 

http://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover

&gt;access to education, 

Which has been reduced with barriers such as graduate taxes being introduced. The quality has also declined see the Wolf report.

&gt;oversees flights, 

&gt;decent clothing, 

None of which has anything to do with the government.

&gt;infant mortality, 

&gt;reduction in global war, 

&gt;road deaths

&gt;violent crime. 

Which has gone up so much that the UK in 2009 was the one of the most violent places on the planet:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445042/Britain-the-most-violent-country-in-western-Europe.html

&gt;1930: Satyagraha - India 1954: Hawai Peace Change 1968: The Prague Spring 1974: The Carnation Revolution in Portugal 1979: The Iranian Revolution 1986: People Power Revolution 1987: The Singing Revolution - Estonia 1989: Eastern Bloc regime changes 1989: the Gentle Revolution - Czechoslovakia 1989: Germany regime change 1990: The Golaniad Romania 1990: The Mongolian Revolution 2000: The Bulldozer Revolution 2004: The Orange Revolution in Ukraine 2005: Cedar Revolution in Lebanon


Funny that because most of those were sparked by an act of violence. The Cedar revolution was a result of an assassination a few months before. The Ukraine revolution? Funny because a war erupted several years later.

&gt;You don't vote in a new government and all of a sudden things change. You're not THAT naive.

Maybe not overnight but has anything really changed in 10 years or even 30 years? Everything you list above is merely a result of fiddling figures or peripheral. We are still ruled over by a corrupt government the participants of which seek to line their own pockets. Provide contracts to their mates who give them jobs afterwards while rights of workers is being demolished (I've cited many times CHINESE workers have more rights than UK workers). With a few more trinkets.

&gt;Nothing when a generation of naive keyboard warriors sit behind their computers all day long and whine like pussies about how powerless they are with barely more than a GCSE understanding of history.

What you mean the government version of history? About how the British empire was all love and kisses and how every war we've fought in the past 10 years was not about profit but about democracy. I've mentioned it many times and I guess I'll reiterate it. 

Back in 2000 I was idealistic as you, I campaigned and wanted to change the world. By 2005 I was very much fuck this nothing changes. In economics and business there is a chart of stake holder theory. Voters are in category 1 i.e. have no power and no interest. You like to think you are in category 3 or 4 where you have significant power and significant interest. You seriously want to say I have power and influence when my vote is worth 0.066 of a vote? Who do you think an MP will listen to? A wealthy person who 'donates' millions of pounds or a voter. 

Go on say it with a straight face a voter.

null,false,Sky-Sky,null,null,null,"Yep, well said. It must be awful to have sexual desires towards children, knowing the potential harm you can cause by acting on them, and knowing also that popular society considers you evil for feelings that you cannot help having. To be honest, having those feelings that are out of your control - and then fighting and resisting them, a choice that IS in your control - seems like the opposite of evil to me.

Help should be widely available for people who have sexual desire towards children, and they should be welcomed and supported into that help, and applauded for stepping forward to ask for it, particularly given the social pressure against them.

It is a fascinating area - is paedophilia a sexual preference (i.e. something that cannot be 'fixed' unless you consider brainwashing and self-denying ala 'pray the gay away' a viable treatment - which I don't think I do)? A mental illness (and thus something that can be 'treated')? A combination? We should be able to discuss this and support those who are at risk of committing harm/crimes without stigma shutting down discussion.

I am speaking in general, rather than specifically about this case. I am tempted to read the court judgment but also tempted not to.

My routine was the basic cleanse, tone, moisturise with concern targetting products tacked on usually as a serum.

* **Oil Cleanser** took me a year of trial and error to find one that works, before that it was makeup remover wipes or a toner on cotton pads. The reduced tugging on skin with oil made a huge difference in my skin's sensitivity.

* **Instant Foam Cleanser** is more of a security blanket for me, helps me make sure there's no oil cleanser residue left.

* **Toner** is a mix of things, on my non-chemical exfoliation days or in the mornings it's to get rid of hard water residue. Chem exofliation nigts the toner is my 2% BHA.

* **Lotions &amp; Potions** is where all my serums are, currently a 10% lactic acid lotion, 20% LAA+ferulic acid serum and a retinol+ferulic acid+a long list of other helpful things serum. If I want something targetted, I'm most likely to end up picking a serum and slotting it in here.

* **Gel Moisturiser** can't believe how many years it took me to finally try one that worked well with my skin and not just be acceptable. I've realised that silicones work best on my skin, while butters, mineral oil and cetyl/cetearyl alcohol will just leave me with a greasy film that can lead to clogging and breakouts.

* **Sunscreen** has been a habit for about 10 years now and started when my aesthetician insisted on it when adding AHA products to my routine. Back then it was mostly greasy feeling and SPF30 with no mention of UVA protection. I've since upped it to SPF50 with PPD16+ with a more comfortable non-shiny finish.

Some colleges will let you take GCSEs alongside Access (my local one does) but many others won't let you enrol on an Access course until you have the relevant GCSEs.

Also I would strongly recommend that you speak to the universities that you want to apply to and find out exactly what Access courses they will and won't accept and if they have any specific subject requirements.

I can keep going if you like?

US police culture is a problem. Poverty, civil disengagement and social integration, lack of good primary and secondary education and opportunities, and cultural damage from historical issues like the Jim Crow laws and systemic discrimination are also big problems in the United States. Taking away guns will not fix these issues.

People love to look at the US and blame their gun culture for all of their problems, and it's a childish and overly simplistic view of the myriad problems which exist there. Are there problems with the gun laws in the US which could do with tweaking? Absolutely there are, but do the problems which we see in places such as Baltimore right now come about as a result of the widespread ownership of firearms in the US? The answer, if you do even 10 minutes of research into this issue, is clearly that they do not come about from this.

In some circumstances, for example in the case of a genuine belief that government officials are embezzling money, I hope everyone would agree that the newspaper shouldn't be scared of publishing that as a front page headline, even if it later turns out their sources are wrong.

On the other hand, you see stories like this one which show that you can publish something utterly false and issue a small print apology about it.

So fining newspapers, especially a week's worth of sales, is really really fucking harsh, especially when most these newspapers struggle to break even anyway. I could see an argument for a % of sales for the newspaper for that specific day, which would then stop the newspaper from profiting from a day's sales when that day's headlines were misleading, but again how do you quantify that? 

A front page apology may be a way to go, but we'd need to think about how this is managed. If I write a page 18 article of 200 words that hardly anyone read and it was totally wrong, obviously a front page apology is too far (as it's the page that sells the newspaper, anything they can't choose themselves is potentially harming sales).

However, if I post a news story on the front page and there is a very minor error (e.g. let's say Ed Miliband made his statement on Wednesday not Tuesday, but the content reported was the same) a front page apology is also too far.

So it's not a cut and dried thing even with the apology.

My opinion is that the only real long term solution is to educate children on politics, economics, and the role of the media in those specifically, but also educate children in general.

In the mean time I think any steps we take to clamp down on newspapers printing things that later turn out to be incorrect is dangerous.

Council tax will be roughly £150.

I'm living in Kent, in a slightly bigger house but there's only one of me. My gas bill this month was £100, (worth noting I have particularly cold house though) electricity around £60, with Eon. EDF is slightly cheaper for me but I haven't got round to changing it yet. I haven't had a water bill yet this month but my last one was around £40. If your house doesn't have a gas supply obviously your electricity will cost more.

The water (and sewerage) cost will depend on your usage, and where you live: you don't have a choice of providers. Find yours (approximately) here: http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/find-your-supplier

Council tax depends on which band your house is classified as. You can find out here: https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-bands. Then search for the local council, find their council tax rates, and the annual cost should be listed.

Tell them that you are hereby giving notice that there is a rental fee of £160/day for the space starting tomorrow and that you will initiate action in the small claims court if they do not pay by cash or cheque within the next 24 hours.

Likely you'll get a knock on your door by some angry working class man. He'll shout some obscenities at you and tell you what a pathetic little person you are.

But he won't park there any more.

At least that's what happened in my case.

Legally, if it is your land, you are entitled to charge rent if and only if you provide notice of the fees in advance. This is called a ""unilateral"" (one-sided) contract. The driver agrees to the contract by performing a specific action - that is, parking in your space. He then owes you money for the space. You could, then, request driver information from the DVLA - and then initiate a Small Claims Court action against the individual for failing to pay for the rental they agreed to by parking in your space. At a minimum getting a Small Claims action will ruin their week and they won't park there anymore. At a maximum they may drag you out of your home and beat you up.

null,false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,null,"&gt;  it is crime simply not being reported and police simply fiddle the figures:


You didn't even read the article you posted. It even says ""The independent Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on a survey of 35,000 households rather than police figures, also shows that crime has fallen by more than 10% over the same period, and to the lowest level since the survey began in 1981"". 

&gt; That is why I have little faith in the government figures.

They're not government figures - they're independent bodies.

&gt; Not read the IFS report? 

You clearly didn't - it states: Relative child poverty in the UK is projected to rise by six percentage points between 2010 and 2020, from 17.5 per cent to 23.5 per cent.

It STILL LOWER even with a 39% increase!

&gt; the UK in 2009 was the one of the most violent places on the planet

That's the dumbest thing you've said so far. You're now actually starting to pull anecdotal evidence, shitty reporting and bizarre statistics to try and force your point.

Nothing you have linked to points shows anything getting worse. A 92% literacy is STILL HIGHER than 70%. All you're doing is arguing over the numbers and acting as though it proves you point. However saying that the UK is the most violent place on the planet is just fucking bizarre. The UK is the 23rd LEAST violent country in the world - the United States is 108th.

&gt; Everything you list above is merely a result of fiddling figures or peripheral.

Oh so in the face of the figures being 'right' originally they're now 'wrong' because of consistent fiddling of the results over the last 30 years. Your tin hat awaits you.

&gt; I've cited many times CHINESE workers have more rights than UK workers

And you're completely wrong. China has widely reported cases of slave labour conditions in it's factories. Poor enforcement of child labour laws and is the most polluted place on earth outside a Japanese reactor plant explosion. They're widely reported as human rights abusers - although you'll probably just argue that this is more government manipulation.

The government doesn't create these figures. Universities, non-partisan groups and MORI are not government shills. You sound like the tin hat brigade. 

&gt; Back in 2000 I was idealistic as you,

Back in the 1970's the rubbish was piling up in the streets with the dead bodies. Blackouts were common, racist groups were rife - in the 80s my family members stood on a picket lines and fought with the police for months in the streets as they shut the coal mines, crippled the local economy and ripped the heart out of towns, sold of the trains, the country was bankrupt, there was massive political unrest, poll tax riots, Brixton race riots, Handsworth race riots, Birmingham race riots, Chapeltown race riots, Leeds race riots, Toxteth race riots, Liverpool race riots, St Paul's police riots, London Poll tax riots, Broadwater Farm Riot, Peckham riots. Massive unemployment (nearly 12%), a quadrupled crime rate in 10 years, 16% inflation, record repossessions and less than 30% of people were even in school at 17 - it's now close to 80%. There were also 10,000 bomb attacks by the IRA from 70's-90's. 

Although you probably put all this down to 'fiddling of the numbers'.

Children have limited ability to consent and refuse, in the sense that an adult may still consent for a child who refuses(because it is assumed that the parent will act in the child's best interests). However, when a parent refuses consent for a child, the court uses it's parens patriae ability to overrule the child/parent as was the case in the case you cited.

Adults, on the other hand, have absolute autonomy. The case of 'Re T' says a person may refuse consent for reasons 'rational, irrational, unknown or non-existent'. This applies even if the refusal ends in death (the case of 'Re C'). It used to be the case that a woman's refusal of consent could be overridden in the interest of her unborn child but it was based on convoluted logic and a balancing of the woman's rights against her child's non-existent ones ('Re S'). Now, the case of 'Re MB' clarifies that a mother's autonomy is absolute. If she refuses a treatment, they cannot perform it. They may only perform the treatment if she does not express a view and becomes incapax (incapacitated or unconscious) and the treatment they intend is in HER interest, not the child.

To perform a treatment against the wishes of a patient is nothing less than assault.

I think that there is a very real cultural relationship but that it has become political at various times. It became ideological during the 80's when there weren't very many other 'anglo saxon' style governments apart from Thatcher and Regan and most European governments were social democratic, and Britain was an 'anglo saxon' influence in the European Union. But now the EU is almost as 'free market' etc as Britain in a slightly different way. There was another upsurge around the Blair years when Britain backed the invasion of Iraq (and various logistical, construction, oil and other companies may or may not have benefited from this), and iirc it even went as far as Britain taking it as a given that future military engagements would essentially be part of future US ones and plan logistically for compatibility etc. I'm not sure if this is still true when there has been cuts to the military budget etc.

&gt; You didn't even read the article you posted. It even says ""The independent Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on a survey of 35,000 households rather than police figures, also shows that crime has fallen by more than 10% over the same period, and to the lowest level since the survey began in 1981"".

The British crime survey routinely under-reports crime. Have a look at the methodology the biggest part is the people can only be victims of crime 5 times. Or that rape and murder isn't included. Why not take away violence and robbery measurement and the UK will be a crime free utopia! 

Ah yes we'll conduct the BCS in the safest area in the UK rather than little Beirut (a suburb of Manchester) or gunchester! 


&gt; That's the dumbest thing you've said so far. You're now actually starting to pull anecdotal evidence, shitty reporting and bizarre statistics to try and force your point.

It's not anecdotal actually:

It was in 2003

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445042/Britain-the-most-violent-country-in-western-Europe.html
 
AND 2009

http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk-has-worst-violent-crime-rate-in-europe-6746864.html

Remember the UK with fiddling as mentioned above is considered the most violent place in Europe and more dangerous than South Africa. 

&gt; And you're completely wrong. China has widely reported cases of slave labour conditions in it's factories. 

http://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/oecdindicatorsofemploymentprotection.htm

Says you're wrong actually, or you gonna pull anecdotal evidence out your ass? Little things like redundancy. Chinese get it after 6 months of working. UK 2 years.

&gt; Back in the 1970's the rubbish was piling up in the streets with the dead bodies. 

You think it isn't today? Bin collections come once a month. Back in the 70s once a week. All that has happened is that it is hidden.

&gt;Blackouts were common, 

The UK has even less spare capacity than back in the 70s

&gt;racist groups were rife -

You think racist groups aren't rife today?  Every few months we have EDL marches. You think I like being racially abused regularly? You think PROVEN stealth racism is even better? You think the ghettos that have sprung up is progress? When Jewish people say to me they're attacked less because the Muslims are being attacked more you think this is progress?

&gt;in the 80s my family members stood on a picket lines and fought with the police for months in the streets as they shut the coal mines, crippled the local economy and ripped the heart out of towns, sold of the trains.

And you have the right to do that today right? Oops no you don't have the right to protest any more. Go look at some of the Manchester satellite towns. Bury for instance there is the call centre (which was downsized 50%) the supermarkets and the council. Nothing else. That's somehow progress? 

&gt;the country was bankrupt, 

Still is.

&gt;there was massive political unrest, poll tax riots, Brixton race riots, Handsworth race riots, Birmingham race riots, Chapeltown race riots, Leeds race riots, Toxteth race riots, Liverpool race riots, St Paul's police riots, London Poll tax riots, Broadwater Farm Riot, Peckham riots. 

There are riots quite often recently if you've ever watched the news.

&gt;Massive unemployment (nearly 12%), 

Yeah we just call them 'economically inactive' these days. So they aren't really unemployed and you have noticed right the definition of unemployed changes regularly:

http://www.shu.ac.uk/research/cresr/sites/shu.ac.uk/files/real-level-of-unemployment-2012.pdf

It is now changed to ineligible to claim benefits = not unemployed... even if they don't have a job. Sanction somebody they suddenly fall off the unemployment stats.

&gt;a quadrupled crime rate in 10 years

Which has increased even more in recent times. Police simply don't attend, if the police don't attend and they don't see it then there is no crime. Go have a look at BCF user called Paddy he was crashed into and was taken onto the Motorway hanging onto the front of a car. The police didn't warrant this as a crime and took no further action. Stolen car? not a crime! Break in not a crime.

Remember if those above news articles stated that the UK is the most violent place WITH fiddling in place what is the real picture? 

&gt;16% inflation, 

Note the change from RPI RPIX to CPI during the 90s. Inflation has been under-reported by the use of the substitution principle and hedonic adjustments. CPI is NOT a measure of inflation but a measure of consumer habits because of this.

&gt;record repossessions and 

Why do you suggest repos are a bad thing? Think moral hazard, bailing out the liars and the cheats just makes them lie and cheat more.

&gt;less than 30% of people were even in school at 17 - it's now close to 80%. 

Which is done to fiddle the unemployment statistics rather than actually educating people.

&gt;There were also 10,000 bomb attacks by the IRA from 70's-90's.

 
&gt; Although you probably put all this down to 'fiddling of the numbers'.

Because largely it is. CPI for instance is a government fiddle of inflation numbers. Unemployment keeps getting re-defined so the claimants are less. Police keep getting caught fiddling the crime figures.",null,0,null,1430603906,null,0,false,0,cqweicn,null,t3_34j54r,null,t1_cqweicn,null,t1_cqwdhed,null,null,null,1432736759,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Legal guidance for consent in emergencies allows doctors to perform additional procedures without explicity seeking consent, where it is considered a necessity to prevent harm to the patient or in this case the baby.

London is expensive. Be prepared to share a flat. Budget about £700-800 for a single bedroom but it will be further out from central London.  I use lebara for phone stuff.  It's like £10-15 a month. 

The tube is the tube.  Get an oyster card right away and add money to pay for trips. You can talk to a person at the station about that. Buying tickets for each trip is a waste of money.  Also stand on the right of the escalators and walk on the left pleeeaaassseee.  

They do have vegetarian and lactose intolerant stuff.  I have a dairy allergy so I have been hunting around the city for all of that stuff. Haha.

I believe you mean they didn't introduce a requirement that all contractors pay the living wage to their employees. The general consensus at the time was that it would not be legal, within EU procurement law, to have such a requirement. The London Assembly also drew the same conclusion when they decided against legislating for the requirement and I believe it's been a recurrent theme elsewhere in Europe. As a government, they do support the living wage with, for example, the recent Abellio contract to run Scotrail containing a guarantee that the living wage would be paid.

If that's the story I'm thinking on, no one was fired or made compulsorily redundant. The reductions in staff numbers were achieved by not filling positions as people left or retired.

They were amazed I didn't know all about it so I started to tell them that in my experience very few people outside of the media, foreigners and a few slightly weird fans even care. 

They countered that there appeared to be a lot of people waiting outside the hospital for news of the baby. I replied that the people who hang around for hours waiting to hear about stranger's babies are certainly weird and not representative of the majority.

so i know of many zoos, i actually visit a lot in my spare time, usually a new one about once a month or so.


Twycross was kinda disappointing when i went a few years ago, lots of very similar monkeys in very similar box cages, and the rest pretty old enclosures, I wasn't a fan of it really. It may have improved in the past few years, I cant say.


Yorkshire Wildlife Park is excellent - its in my hometown in fact. It's very new (5 years i think), constantly expanding and there are walkthrough exhibits for lemurs and wallabies. Their meerkat enclosure is built with windows in the walls so that smaller kids can see in to them and what they are doing. There are some goat/sheep things that the kids can get close to as well. There's also a south american walkthrough where you can get close to squirrel monkeys and a few other animals too!

It also has baby tigers (these may not be on display yet as they've only just been born, but they had triplets recently). I know they have some kids shows with birds, ferrets etc, but I've never been to one of those so i cant say much more. I tend to go every 3-6 months, and its always fantastic. It's not the biggest wildlife place as it's still growing [their map is here](http://www.yorkshirewildlifepark.com/#!ywp-site-map/cqh1), but it does have very large and very new enclosures for all the animals (it has the largest non-drive-through lion enclosure in europe iirc), and it's definately at least a half day if not more.

in terms of number of animals, by far Chester Zoo has the most, its a pretty cool zoo , and they are opening a new massive part of the zoo any time now , but its gotten so large you cant see everything in one day now ,and some of their enclosures are old and not very interactive. It does have monorail, boat ride and a cool walk through bat cave thing though.

those are probably your top3 within driving distance. I'm biased but i'd probably go with YWP",null,0,null,1430607990,null,0,1430656878,0,cqwgdnd,null,t3_34nybh,null,t1_cqwgdnd,null,t3_34nybh,null,null,null,1432737640,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

Woman is walking past a fence with her dog. The kitten is perched on the fence, minding its own business. The woman spots it and deliberately stops and it's pretty obvious that she's encouraging her dog to jump up at this kitten. 

Meanwhile I'm screaming in my head for this kitten to just jump down to safety on the other side, but it doesn't. Eventually the dog manages to pull the kitten down. The kitten flees from the dog as it is still on a lead at this point.

Then the woman decides to *unleash* her dog and she encourages it to chase after the kitten. She actively encouraged this. She wanted her dog to maul that cat. This was in no way, shape or form an accident of any kind. It was obvious that if the cat hadn't been there, she wouldn't have stopped there in the first place. 

The dog is not even to blame for this. It's all her. 

She deserves jailtime for such sociopathic behaviour and of course, a lifetime ban on owning pets.

London is far more mixed between rich &amp; poor and different ethnicities than most American cities. You will be in very well off areas, only to turn the corner to find a council estate (government subsidised housing), or vice versa. 

The tube is easy, just get an Oyster card and top it up at the machine. Also, my biggest London travel tip:

It's awesome. 

I know it's a cliché, but it's true - most Americans I've met, are, on average, louder than normal. Try to keep it down. Fag means cigarette, saying ""alright?"" just means hello, stand to the right on all escalators, jaywalking is fine, drinking is legal in public, and is legal from the age of 18 (even though you might think drinking culture is a big part of college in the US, I bet you don't realise that we have student bars on campus that are subsidised by the university).

Emergency healthcare is free for everyone, and as soon as you have an address and proof of residence, all healthcare is free. You don't need private insurance - it's not worth it. http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68

Concern: possibly hormonal acne, some closed comedones and blackheads which are very, very, painfully slowly looking like they are opening up and on their way out. 

I have been focusing on moisturising and spf for my outbreak of painful little cysts, which start out under the surface of my skin and then emerge as the tiniest whitehead, but very swollen and still very large beneath my skin. I have come to the conclusion they are a result of me coming to the end of a packet of birth control pills at the end of each month as I always get them around the same time. My GP gave me some Zineryt which was an antimicrobial, which I was reluctant to use as it can have the same effects as antibiotics and leave you with more problems than you started out with -  it was useless anyway, I still broke out, and I am going back soon. Moisturising  and snails seem to be helping a lot with the inflammation, specifically CeraVe, Mizon All In One, and Superdrug Simply Pure serum. 

This means however that I can't focus on exfoliation as well for my pih, blackheads and ccs! Which is very frustrating. I am considering upping my weekly lactic peel strength, or retrying Nip Fab glycolic pads for use every other day, to help combat these. my BHA, stridex, seems to not be working as efficiently as usual, and I suspect it has to do with the PH of my skin when using it.

Doctors may perform procedures in an emergency, which are of the nature and scope consented to, however, if they can wait and/or ask for permission, they must. Refusal by adults is binding unless the person's capacity to consent is hindered by mental disability. The baby's interests cannot legally overcome the mother's consent following the case of 'Re MB'. Advance refusal WILL trump the decision to cut regardless of whether the baby would die.

Get waterproof gear and a waterproof onsie oversuit thing. 

Buy a paddock stand for ease of chain maintenance, it means you wont scrimp on it because it's much easier.

Buy a disc lock to keep under your seat for when you're just going into the shops.

Get heated grips if you plan to ride in cold or wet weather. Perhaps also handguards (these help way more than you may think).

Buy tires with the weather in mind, so always go for one that is good in the wet. Even our good days in the UK get spoiled by wet and you don't want to end up on your ass.

Get a balaclava, keeps the wind off your chin/neck and keeps things slightly quieter. Also get earplugs for any lengthy journeys - helmet noise is quite loud even though you don't notice it. Earplugs are £5 for 10 pairs on ebay that you can clean and reuse every few weeks, good oxford balaclava is under a tenner but often on deals for less than this.

Don't get too paranoid avoiding wet drain covers, unless you're going quick. Chances are you'll come off in a panicked attempt to avoid them before you would from hitting them.

Spend well on gloves. We get a fair bit of rain - and cold, wet hands suck when those are how you control the bike. If you ever plan to be out when its wet, get a goretex pair, J&amp;S do good ones that start at £50.

Get a helmet with a pinlock insert. This is basically a detachable 'double glazing' for your helmet that will stop it fogging up. When you're out in cold air or in rain, the fogging gets a lot worse and they become more useful.

Cameras are angled lower to the ground so as not to betray the fact that there isn't really anyone there, the shot is taken from a short distance, making sure to encompass the handful of activists that have arrived within the frame.

Jim Murphy stands defiantly in the centre perched precariously on his Irn Bru crate, preaching to the choir and the next day it's plastered in the newspaper as some sort of successful Labour rally.

null,false,Albigularis,Scotland,くコ:彡Kawasaki Z1000,null,"Filtering is relatively safe, however for every car you pass, the possibility of an accident increases. This isn't an issue on very densely congested roads as the cars will generally have nowhere to go anyway. It also means if you leave the front of the queue quicker than the cars, you'll have no vehicles right beside you, which is much safer than sitting in some texting, smoking, chav, fuckwits blindspot. I've only ever had one person attempt to block me filtering. I backed up and went round the other side of him and opened his boot.

As for where - there is no set law on it. Filtering is effectively overtaking, so doing it on the other side of the road is fine if there is nothing coming. Straddling the divider is fine as well as long as there is room between you and the oncoming traffic. You can go between two lanes of traffic going one way on a dual carriageway or motorway, but you're generally supposed to be filtering as far to the right as you can. Never filter on the left in built up areas or city unless very careful, you'll be tasting door if you get into a habit of that. Filtering is discouraged at junctions due to traffic that changes their mind last minute to u-turn on the side streets and so on. This gets people knocked off a lot. Again, if slow enough you'll be okay and have time to brake/avoid.

The highway code on filtering is basically ""do it safe"". Oh, and if you filter to the front of traffic you are *theoretically* not allowed to pass the car at the front. But it's also illegal to sell alcohol to drunk people - so not all laws are followed to the letter. I dare say 99% of police don't even know about that caveat actually. UK filtering is generally safe because it's been around a long time and is expected of bikers, whereas any statistics from the US will be skewed since most states there don't allow it and most people think it's illegal in the ones where you can do it...

America is quite pro-nationalist/patriotic and whilst we are patriotic too, the MOST OPENLY patriotic people here are usually racist... so its difficult to express openly. If it isn't a sports event or royal event and people are chanting and waving English flags... maybe be careful.

Healthcare wise, I think officially you might need to pay a certain amount a year (this is a very recent change for non EU migrants/students so check on this and dont take other people's ""no its just free"" for granted.) But I think its included with the Visa (but check). Either way, you can rock up to a hospital holding your severed leg, they'll stitch it back on and send you on your way without any paperwork.

That said, you will need to register with a GP (General Practitioner, a basic non emergency doctor) near where you live which requires a form, but register soon after you get here as you can't just register the day you need to be seen.

Personally, sustaining a debt is not healthy. For countries though, sustaining a debt is in fact very healthy. And in some cases it's optimal to sustain a very large debt. To run a surplus, as a country, is a bad thing. It means you're not optimising your use of cash and therefore being highly inefficient. The article mentions economists, and I believe the number is something like 85% of economists disagree with the current government's fiscal policy. Yet people who studied politics get to set the policy based on their ideology, as opposed to people who studied economics. Maddening. 

In comments against articles like the linked one I keep seeing the same arguments from misinformed people who think they know better, when they don't.

null,false,BestFriendWatermelon,null,null,null,"&gt;how much is cost of living generally (food, water bill, electric bill, rent for a 1 br flat, internet, phone bill)?

Rent is extremely expensive in London, and you won't be able to afford to live anywhere near the centre (unless you're rich, in which case Hi!). North London is cheaper and quite cosmopolitan but you can still expect to pay £600/mth for even the most basic flat. I strongly recommend looking into house sharing. The other bills are probably slightly more expensive than Americans are used to, but will be the same rates as anywhere else in the UK.

Bottom line: the UK is more expensive that the US. Be prepared to feel poor.

&gt;what are the bad parts of London? (AKA the projects.... do you guys call them projects?)

We don't call them projects, we call them council estates. I wouldn't call them safe, but they're miles apart from what Americans are probably used to. We don't have guns, and although there are some nasty gangs the police are in control. Avoid Brixton, Hackney, Tottenham, Peckham, Croydon, Edmonton, and Tulse Hill if you can.

&gt;how does the tube work? 

The tube is intimidating at first, but it's fast and easy. People on the tube don't talk to each other, look at each other, and sit in stony silence. Breaking the silence is a faux pas; people will stare angrily but say and do nothing if you do so.

&gt;what's some important slang I need to know?

I wouldn't know where to begin, but you'll be fine with American English. Just know that ""pants"" means underwear here, and that ""the dogs bollocks"" means awesome.

&gt;What are some big No no's I need to make sure I don't do, that would typically be acceptable in american culture?

Saying anything like ""We saved your ass in WW2"" will never go down well. Your history books teach that. Ours teach that we held down the fort, fighting nazi evil, defending freedom alone under relentless bombardment until an opportunistic America, too cowardly to join the good fight until Japan slapped them at Pearl Harbour, grudgingly decided to join. If you find that interpretation of history insulting, we find the ""America to the rescue!"" narrative equally offensive.

Equally, don't make a big deal over the war of American independence. British history books teach that the war was about greedy American landowners refusing to pay tax on the goods their slaves produced for them. And that the tax was to pay for British soldiers to protect the colonies from Indian and French attacks. 

Both versions of history on these events are kinda correct, but the British are proud (so are Americans) so don't wind us up with historical narratives that paint us as weak or nasty (every country has skeletons in their closet). 

We Brits can criticise the monarchy but foreigners can not. Even agreeing with a Brit on their opinion of the monarchy can offend. In /r/unitedkingdom they're making fun of the royal baby born today, but I wouldn't recommend joining in if you're American.

Barrack Obama made the mistake of calling America ""the world's oldest democracy"" (it isn't, Britain was a democracy before America had independence). Generally the British despise arrogance (although we may be guilty of it) so patriotic American gush like ""USA! USA! USA!"" isn't approved, and generally British flags are only displayed by right wing extremists here.

&gt;Healthcare. considering I'm american does that mean I'll still pay for healthcare, if so can I be insured?

As long as you are on an educational course lasting more than 6 months, it should be free of charge. The best place to check is with the school you are going to attend. Emergency treatment is always free of charge regardless. Whether you're entitled to free healthcare or not, you'll still have to pay for dental treatment, opticians and the like. You can get health insurance, but I don't recommend it if you're entitled to free healthcare as you're basically paying to receive the same treatment in the same hospitals, except with better catering.

&gt;How vegetarian friendly, and lactose intolerant friendly is London?

London's probably the best place in the world for this. 

&gt;anything else you'd be kind enough to inform me on

Watch your pockets in London, same as any large city. Pickpockets are common. 

Don't ever put down a laptop/mobile/etc on the floor/seat for even a second to do something else (like to get out your wallet to pay for something in a shop, for example). Keep it in your hands and never out of sight. If you're holding a bag in your hands, you may need to suddenly grip the handle tightly in the event that a bag snatcher makes a grab. Again this is true in any big city, and isn't particularly bad in the UK but still. 

Be wary of scams, if you're minding your own business and someone approaches you offering to sell you something or asking directions, be immediately suspicious and watch them, and anyone loitering nearby like a hawk. While you're dealing with them you're not seeing their friend casually slip their hand into your pocket, or them pulling something out of your bag themselves while they've got your eye contact.",null,0,null,1430618129,null,0,false,0,cqwkqz6,null,t3_34nv9g,null,t1_cqwkqz6,null,t3_34nv9g,null,null,null,1432739771,null,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6,null

I'm still skeptical on Slade considering his lack of experience with the championship. I would ideally like a manager who knows how to promote out of it and hold a place in the premier league.

Whittingham, in my opinion, is best utilised in a 4-5-1 formation. In a 4-4-2, I would probably leave him out. I went to the Blackpool game and definitely saw a lot more creativity in midfield with Kennedy, Ralls, O'Keefe etc. He's still a lazy player but he is someone who can pick out some key passes and definitely does that consistently.

One thing I picked up on in recent games is how the first 20 minutes or so, we will play decent football, the midfield will move up as a unit and always offer options for passes. Then we'll start playing deeper and offering no options in midfield, lost the ball and sometimes be outnumbered.

Personally, I think the entire US justice system is horrifying. And it has led to racial division across American society. You can't pick apart the animosity between blacks and police without looking at a broader spectrum of oppression. Too many innocent blacks in prison on plea bargains because it's easier than facing a psychotic judge elected on a platform of harsh punishment, all white juries and corrupt cops determined to prove their guilt, even if it means lying.

It seems like blacks don't trust white cops to abide with the law. They'd rather try and run or fight than risk surrendering and being shot anyway.

As for the riots, I disagree with those who say it accomplishes nothing. The authorities have a duty of care to all human beings, and are failing blacks. The only thing that may frighten authorities into change, make them change the way things are done is when rioters punish society for failing them. 

Avoiding killing innocents apparently isn't enough to inspire US authorities to change police tactics, bring in chest cams , etc. Avoiding having half the city burning down might.",null,0,null,1430620915,null,0,false,0,cqwlzvx,null,t3_34l86w,null,t1_cqwlzvx,null,t3_34l86w,null,null,null,1432740357,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

People will down-vote me for saying this but there will be enough games for all these players if there is proper rotation. Some like Mikel will be content with sitting on the bench the majority of games anyways.

This will be my dream line-up for next year:

Courtois

Ivanovic(Dave) - Varane - Terry - Dave(Luis)

Matic

Fabregas - Koke

Willian - Costa - Hazard

Kondogbia will play in the more physical games. Not only he is a great player defensively he can contribute a lot attackingly and wouldn't disrupt our momentum.

Icardi will be a fantastic back-up to Costa. He is young and talented and I think he would be looking forward to moving to the bigger stage.

Koke is just the missing puzzle in our team. Sometimes when we go up 1-0 or 2-0, we seem to be rather too conservative/defensive, causing us to concede goals. With players like him, being the complete player that he is, we can control games. He would give us a lot of alternatives in terms of tactics and our approaches to the games.

That pension pot is now worth £14,400.

Your riches have increased by £11,400.

Let's run those numbers (very roughly) on your contributions. 

£140 per month at 4% for 40 years = £150k

£280 per month at 4% for 40 years = £300k

You put in an extra £67k (140*12*40) and get back an extra £150k.

Now, these are just example numbers - pensions can go down as well as up, you might start earning more and contributing more, or take a career break and stop paying in. 

But what this hopefully shows you is the more you pay in now, the longer your money has to work for you. 

So, on to your actual question! 

&gt; what a good pension looks like or what a good tradeoff between losing a chunk of my salary now vs a good pension later looks like.

How much you need in retirement is a tricky one. Will you have paid off your mortgage? How long do you expect to live for? Do you want to pay for any children you may have to go to university? Want to sail around the world in you yacht or play golf in Bournemouth? Will your spouse also have a pension? 

What will your salary be when you retire? As a very rough for of thumb, you want at least 50% of your final salary to live on per year. 

It's scary to think that far ahead. So many things can change. But, one thing is for sure - having a big pot of cash won't hurt! 

Now the big question - the tradeoff. 

Every penny you put into a pension is a penny you can't put towards a housing deposit. 

Every pound you spend on a takeaway tonight is a pound you're robbing from your future self's savings. 

Money is a tool to maximise the utility of happiness.

Buying a Tesla Roadster will make you very happy now - but leave you impoverished and miserable in old age. 

Sticking 80% of your salary into a pension will leave you very wealthy after a lifetime of living on beans on toast. 

No one here can tell you what that balance is. 

Personally, I think that saving 15% of your salary into a pension now is a good idea - as long as you also have a plan for your medium term happiness (buying a house for example) and short term happiness (going on holiday somewhere exotic). 

Have a think about what your future looks like. See if your work or your union offers any financial advice to help you make these big decisions.

Study what genuinely interests you. Look up the first year reading lists at some good universities, pull out the 'introduction to xxxx' book and get a feel for the real subject.

If something in particular grabs you, there could be a professional route built in: Biological Sciences or Neuroscience, for example.

As an entry level employee, it's brilliant for young people. They're flexible with hours so you can manage round uni (I would bump up my hours over summer then reduce them the next semester). You'll have a steady, decent pay check that's not dependant on the boss' mood or whether you could hit targets. You'll also be surrounded by people your age (and mind frame) or people who are older and happy where they are (so not many people stepping on your neck to get above you). You also have a huge amount of job security.

The cons are that it's hard to progress naturally (older folk not moving on and giving chance for natural promotion), a lot of decisions made up top seem pretty stupid (you will be working for the government after all) and, generally, taxi drivers will take an immediate disliking to you. 

On to your questions; there are comparable private sector jobs for all public sector departments. Taxes, benefits, collection, and employment law advice all have companies in the private sector. Private sector, usually, are smaller so they have more agency over what they do. They also generally pay more, have bonus schemes and more opportunities for progression. But they have more targets and less job security. More risk for more reward. 

As for the fast track, I had two friends complete it recently. One has a degree in German (BArts) and the other has one in Zoology (Bsc). They aren't bothered about what type of degree you have, it's more about the determination to actually achieve one. The scheme is intense though. Apparently a third of selected candidates failed the first test and got put back to their previous role.

If you mean Michael Brown that it has been demonstrated in a court that Brown had attacked Officer Wilson, had tried to seize his weapon, and was charging Wilson when the fatal shots were fired. It was also demonstrated that Wilson ceased firing when Brown was running away or stood still, and only resumed firing when Brown charged him. 

If you are talking about Walter Scott then most officers would agree with you that that was a bad shoot, and the officer that did it has been arrested and charged with murder, as they should have been. 

&gt; You effectively now have a standing army, since your police were heavily militarized in the early 90's.

Yeah, no. The US police are not heavily militarised. They have offensive weapons that any American who has not been convicted of a felony has the right to purchase - AR15s, sniper rifles, sidearms etc are all legal for Americans to own. The exception to this is various incapacitant gases (tear gas, cs etc).

Defensively, they may have more equipment, but what's wrong with defending yourself against a nutter with an AK47 with an armoured vehicle? It has no offensive capabilities beyond an officer sticking out of the top with one of those legal for anyone to own rifles.

This is for a number of reasons; yes to free space in hospitals, and to protect against superbugs but also because people are happier and more relaxed at home. There's a shift from seeing birth as a complicated medical issue where we have to wrap women and babies up in cotton wool, to one where we let the human body do what it's designed to do and step in if necessary; it means happier mothers and healthier babies. There are even moves to have all babies at home with a midwife present, and only going to the hospital in an emergency.

From what my friends who have had a normal birth say, you're up and walking about within a couple of hours so its pointless to keep them in hospital when they could be relaxing at home.

As for post-natal care, we have a great midwife system which is slightly different to the US, such as here midwives deliver babies whereas in the US it's usually an Ob/Gyn. They check in with new mothers regularly, and are available to call 24 hrs for advice. My friend who has just had her first was having problems breastfeeding in the middle of the night, she was able to call the midwife for advice on what to do, and was checked up on first thing in the morning. We also have a good pre-natal system which helps parents as well.

&gt;1.2 Labour’s bequest The position on the eve of the crisis
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the UK economy experienced fairly strong, and extremely stable, growth. But despite this, at the time of the March 2008 Budget, public sector net borrowing in 2007–08 was thought to have been £36.4 billion or 2.6% of national income.
The April 2014 IMF and June 2014 OECD estimates are that structural borrowing in 2007 was larger still, at 5.3% and 4.9% of national income respectively.
One way of thinking about this is that – after more than a decade of strong growth – the deficit in the years prior to 2008 had been substantial and debt had grown as a proportion of national income in every year since it had dipped below 30% of national income in 2001–02. To believe this was genuinely cautious fiscal management really would require you to believe that boom and bust had been abolished – as Gordon Brown claimed on a number of occasions that it had been.[here](http://election2015.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch1_gb2015.pdf)",null,0,null,1430644129,null,0,false,0,cqwt61p,null,t3_34n0tt,null,t1_cqwt61p,null,t3_34n0tt,null,null,null,1432743747,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Here's where my opinion weighs into this: I feel as though the pundits are speaking about a different set of circumstances. Last year we needed to fill out the squad to try and cope with Europe which is what Steve Nicol said. But the young guy is banging on about how we need to fill out the squad again. Which I think isn't needed. What we do need is the player that can light up the scoring, the player that can dominate the midfield and the one whom is able to command from the back.

Does anyone really think Chelsea hate United?
We've never really competed with them? So really any hate is just periodical jealousy imo.

Liverpool on the other hands have always been cunts. Believe in a captain who's never been a great leader imo. And are pretty much cocky cunts always trading on their ""history"" in lieu of adding to it.

Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal. All on a similar level of me hating their teams. Arsenal it's mainly the contradictory and mostly mundane ill-informed ""uneducated"" fans who end up sounding like a legion of brainwashed troglodytes. Similarly but to a much lesser extent I guess I could say the same of QPR.
Barcelona it's both the fans and the highly corrupt club and then the whole effing Spanish government beyond that. And Liverpool it's both Club and fans. And seeing as we play Liverpool probably the most regularly. I'm struggling to find any other team I really hate.

You absolutely should give a bike as much space as a car, but it's not always possible in cities. Instead, my rule of thumb is that you're too close if I can touch your car. The slower the traffic, the closer you can overtake safely. I will also occasionally squeeze into smaller spaces in slow moving traffic, if I feel safe doing so. When that happens, I'm the one who's assessed the risk, so as long as you don't get any closer than you currently are, you're fine.

If the Conservatives do well they'll still need the Lib Dems if they want majority government, and if Labour do team up with the SNP many polls indicate that the Lib Dems would be needed for a majority. They could still be kingmakers. They're weaker than in 2010, but not dead by a long shot.

""Minor input"" is ridiculous too. You can even ignore what they *have* done if you want - but stopping the repeal of the Human Rights Act, blocking the Snoopers' Charter, postponing an EU referendum and holding only the second national referendum in our history sounds pretty fucking significant to me.

The Conservatives had to renege on about as many campaign promises, and you know what? Labour had to renege on all of theirs, because they weren't in government! That's the alternative the Lib Dems face. 

Besides, every government ever is unpopular. Should the Conservatives have declined to govern from 1979 to 1997 because it would make them lose the 1997 general election. Should Labour have done the same in 1997, 2001 and 2005 so that they could ""live to fight"" in 2010? None of those government fulfilled every campaign or manifesto promise either (and how is ""getting stuck to the Tories' record"" not just as bad as getting stuck to Labour's?).

null,false,going_dicey,null,null,null,"What he's referring to is a completely different beast. Quick tutorial:

There are two types of tenure in land; freehold and leasehold. Freehold is land that the owner will own outright for an unlimited number of years. The freeholder can effectively do whatever they please with the land (subject to title restrictions and the law). A leasehold, on the other hand, is renting. The leaseholder owns rights to the land for a specified period of time. This could be a short lease like a traditional 12 month assured shorthold tenancy or it could be a long lease for 999 years. 

In London, the majority of properties sold are on what's called a long lease. The reason for this is twofold. This effectively means you are a tenant (but for a specified number of years--usually in the region of 99yrs-125yrs). Each year, you pay 'ground rent' to the landlord. The amount that /wings22 quoted for ground rent is about right. 

Long leases have a lot more issues and hidden costs to them than your standard freehold. This is because depending on certain factors you have a legal right to extend the lease (which comes at a hefty cost), but you also have to pay the landlord the cost of certain types of maintenance. This means if your roof falls in, your landlord gets to pick who sorts it out. And guess who gets to foot the bill?

/Wings22's post does not apply at all to freeholds.

She was petite, 5 foot and slim, slim hips etc. He was a normal size baby. Anyway during the delivery he would not come out. She was pushing. swearing screaming and he still wouldn't come out. Too late to give a caesarian and if he wasn't delivered in the next, I think it was about 5-10 mins he would die. It really was that serious.

The last resort was to use the big shears to slice through in order to deliver the baby. They are huge, stainless steel, f#cking terrifying. Long story short I looked the doctor in the eye and told him to cut if he had to save my sons life ( she had the scan prior to delivery) She squirted him out real quick I think the shears scared her more than me. Son was born happy and well but with a pointy head, a really pointed head' like one of the coneheads.

I think one of the reasons in the states they prefer caesarian over natural child birth is because of litigation, I think I remember reading that  doctor's insurance in this field is the most expensive

&gt;Was your son able to qualify his answer?

Yes he could.


&gt;if a lady was concerned that her husband is the type of man that makes her sit away from her, she can leave him. I don't believe anyone is being forced in this situation, sure they're pressured but they can leave any time they want but choose not to.

I hear this all of the time when people criticise women who suffer domestic abuse but don't leave. Asking ""why doesn't she leave ?"" is the wrong question. Try asking ""how can she leave ?"" instead.

What if the women told where to sit by their husbands have no income ? What if they have no friends ? What if they couldn't support their children or had to leave them behind ? What if she had nowhere to go ? What happens if her husbands finds her again ? What if she'll get a slap when they get home ?

You assume that these women have chosen to self segregate. What if some of them don't want to, but are afraid to speak out ? By agreeing to talk to a segregated audience these politicians are giving approval to behaviour that should be consigned to history. 

The reasons behind this segregation may be religious, they may be cultural. Either way they have no place in 21st century UK.

Say a left-wing newspaper keeps publishing stories about a right-wing party doing dubious business practices.

The newspaper is now making a loss for printing these stories and decides and the next time they get word of one of these dubious practices they refrain from publishing it in fear of retaliation. 

It should be blatantly obvious that's why we need freedom of the press, albeit freedom with accountability.

Nice 20s art deco function room and bar area, fully stocked exhibition grounds full of old cars and stuff so everyone can go poke around in (if) when it gets boring and for a 500 quid bung they open up their own race track for people to get taken round some of the old cars in. It's even got a concorde for people to walk around in and have a look.    
  
  They weren't taking the piss with the prices either, and seemed to be the most flexible. It's also about 5 minutes away from the church and the missus liked it, trouble is going to be convincing her parents it's a great idea (as they've agreed to foot some of the cost).

Anyway, I'd recommend trying to ease yourself back in to regular life. Find constructive things you can do alone at home at first - like learning another language on Duolingo and talking to other people on Interpals, etc. - just keep at it in your spare time.

As for work, if you like computers then do some MOOCs on programming on Coursera, EdX, and Stanford's Lagunita - most are free (though they're becoming rarer so do it now!). Learn SQL, Javascript and Python and Ruby On Rails - see CodeAcademy, then try to do some projects. 

Install Ubuntu so development is easier and there are less distractions.

Eventually you should meet more people using Meetup.com (perhaps about languages, or hiking, etc.) and try to go to a gym to do some exercise (as it really helps doing something constructive to avoid feeling like you're just waiting all the time). You can also use Facebook groups in your area, etc. - the benefit being that you can speak to people a bit before you meet them.

It's hard to find work, but at least in tech it really is the case that if you can do the work well, you will get the job. It's not like sales, etc. where it's all based around personality and class, etc.

A lot of *what ifs* in there. Are we assuming we're talking about a room full of abused women now? This could be a room full of educated professional women that wish to sit separately.

 There are mechanisms and options for abused women, we can't fly in through the window of every unhappy woman and save her from the tyranny of men, people have to help themselves. I think for the most part, in this picture nearly everyone of those women is happy to sit separately from her loving husband for a little while during a speech. I expect some of them think it archaic, ridiculous and wish to change it. I even expect that some of the men think it's crazy too, but they're going along with a cultural norm. 

I think one of the great thing in British culture is equality and is the kind of value we have that can permeate other cultures. So while I don't like that this room is split like that, getting our pitchforks, likening their culture to apartheid and getting all angry isn't going to help, it contributes to a barrier of cultures which will hinder the spread of what's good about this country.

It wasn't ok - she's a kid. I'm not even sure if I'd feel it was ok if she was an adult. It feels very intimidating given they had other digital ways to contact her. She's active enough on Twitter that if they'd reached out to her via DM and she didn't reply, the message she wasn't interested in giving an interview would have been obvious. Researching her gran's addy is just creepy, and actually knocking on the door to try to talk to a kid is seriously an asshole move.

null,false,leedsimpson,null,null,null,"Just a few insights into how the police disciplinary process works when it comes to excessive use of force complaints - I don't have the statistics as they are not readily available, but I would wager that the vast majority of these complaints are allegations of common assault level force, i.e. where there is no visible or documented injury. In that situation, the complaint is investigated by the forces internal professional standards unit and referred to the IPCC if necessary, whereas allegations of more serious assault with documented, unexplained injuries are referred immediately and the officer is removed from front line duties.

The disparity I think, is where there are injuries that are documented but rationally explained by the incident export, for example if a man has cuts and injuries to his wrists following an arrest where force was used to put handcuffs on. It could be that the injuries were a lawful use of Sec.117 of PACE (constables power to use force for policing purposes) while arresting the male, or it could be something that was unlawful and therefore ABH or above. In this situation, it's decided on a case by case basis whether to remove the officer from front line duties, a decision that is clearly regularly skewed in favour of keeping them on the beat, for two reasons. One is that with the cuts to front line policing (like all public services in the UK) the force makes the argument that removing officers who have no hard evidence that an unlawful use of force has occurred would mean that too many officers would be removed from duty and cause a shortage and increased response times, and also, it takes the pressure off the investigating department to conclude the investigation ASAP so that the officer can be returned to duty, or removed permanently in some cases and criminal charges brought, which allows for a more thorough investigation.

Personally I don't think that the system is perfect here in the UK, but it is in the interest of the public who bring these complaints to police attention and the officers involved that the investigation system be given adequate resources to do its job properly, and I don't think it is being given those resources at the moment. I certainly don't see any evidence of the misuse of the system on the scale that is apparently going on over in America at the moment however.

I work in HR and from what I've seen it's a bit of a faff to open a UK bank account as a non-national.  Check procedure on how to do this before you arrive as without a bank account, you won't be able to rent a flat - and you may need an address to open a bank account.  Your college/uni should be able to help there.

Don't get a car, there's no point.  Almost everywhere is accessible by public transport in London.  Outside London is a different story though, so check.

Long distance travel is usually done by train or coach.  Coaches are cheaper but slower and more rubbish.  www.nationalrail.com  You may be eligible for a 16-25 railcard, which can be attached to your oyster.  It's for people age 16-25 as you might have guessed.

To answer your question properly it all comes down to this summer for me. Who do we sign from here? How do we prepare for the new season in regard to formation and tactics? I feel that Brendan can be very stubborn with his in game tactics and refuses to change things until it's far too late and even then his choice of who to bring on leaves me asking ""why bring him on?"" quite frequently.

I'm not so optimistic as many of you are in this sub, I think most of my opinions are however quite realistic and for me if we had the opportunity to bring in an experienced manager who has a record of winning things then we should do it.

Participating in committee consultancy on a topic of interest.

Voicing or expression disagreement with policy/decisions at local or national level.

Other than ignorance or intended apathy. A 'None of the above' or spoiling your ballot indicates your lack of engagement in politics and nothing more. Yes politics can be boring, it can be punch and judy point scoring or it can be very technical. However there is plenty of platforms which delivers this information for free and with simplicity, failing that your MP has an obligation to keep you informed should you wish.

The election is there to decided which party you think should form the next Government. NOTA or Spoiling serves no purpose and dilutes the chance for real change. If you truly think no party ticks all your boxes then do something about it. Decide who comes close (regardless of how far) and then do something about it.  It's not easy to change policy from the bottom but it's a hell of a lot easier than ever before. Your voice doesn't stop at the ballot box unless you allow it to.

People have a right to vote but I'd liken it more to a privilege. You have the opportunity to be part of one of the most important elections in a long time. The whole dynamic and future of the country you live in can very much depend on our votes.

* Daniel Sturridge, when fit, is still quite clearly our best striker. He's not been at his best by own standards, but Sturridge's worst is still a cut above the rest of the team.

* Balotelli has actually played more than any other forward besides Sterling, who has been playing on the wing more often than not. I wish we could strip this down to just his striker appearances, but ah well.

* Speaking of Sterling, his pass completion and chance creation is surprisingly good for a winger who can't cross.

* Borini appears better than a lot of people give him credit for, although I will concede there's no field for ""3-minute red cards"" 

* Sadly, the most striking stat is of course goals per 90. Sturridge's strike rate is acceptable, but the drop-off between him and the rest is all too telling. A goal every ten games is nowhere near good enough for the premiership, let alone Liverpool.

Of course we had high debt in the past, the Napoleonic Wars were very expensive, as was the Great war and WWII, so tracking the deficit doesn't really say much.

The problem is our current deficit isn't due to any all out total wars, or anything similar, its due to the financial crises, poor growth figures in the last few years, and lack of saving in the boom periods, so its hard to compare really. The graph that I've linked, shows the evolution of debt after previous spikes and, it shows that it took as much as two-hundred years to pay back some debts. 

So the question is why hurry to cut the deficit, when it means slashing public services? Its mainly about weighing up the loss in terms of services today versus the loss in interest payments in pro-longing repayment.

You can [call Jobcentre Plus](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number) to apply for an NI number as long as you have the right to work and live in the UK which Irish citizens do.

As for getting a flat, it will depend on the landlord. Some ask for references and so on, or a deposit. I can't think of any obstacles, and having moved to France myself it was a case of showing up, paying the deposit and the rent and signing the lease.

If you are ordinarily resident in the UK (i.e. you live here, work here, etc.) you have the same rights to NHS treatment [as UK citizens](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/healthcare/help-with-health-costs/nhs-charges-for-people-from-abroad/).

Other than that, there's not much I can think of. I know that my flatmate, who's an Irish citizen from Northern Ireland, can't get anything beyond a ""basic"" bank account due to residency restrictions, so she might have to make do with one of those until she has some money coming in.

FY 2014 pension spending was £143.2 bn; the pension is £115.95 per week; there are [10m pensioners](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/) in the UK.

Quite a gap!

Looking further, 'pensions' is split into 'sickness and disability' (£37.8 bn), 'old age' (£104.26 bn) and 'survivors' (£1.13 bn) ([figures](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_2002_2016UKb_14c1li111mcn_01t02t03t04t#view)). So there's still quite a gap.

Hasn't been great but he pushed Danny Rose to the next level by providing competition.

I like him and think he will continue to provide a good option against larger, direct teams. Also, he punched Costa. Even though it was before he came to us, it's enough to move him from a B- to a B.

You are however entirely right to say we haven't *well* for so long - we might have had the odd glimpse of passing and moving well (last week's second goal against Tottenham) but we always manage to throw those away with stupid mistakes.  

I've said for a while that the Lallana type player is the one we're missing, Tadic was never quite up to Lallana's standard of drawing players out or moving through the middle, and neither has anyone else, it's been such a problem.  

The other thing I'm trying to think of - when was the last time we scored a goal from outside the area that wasn't purely some ridiculous keeper error (like Sunderland or Hull)? I'm honestly struggling to remember a proper outside of the area whack, curl, or placed goal of any kind; and to make matters worse we're barely able to do so in the area half the time!  

It's been so frustrating that such a good start (and it was absolutely fantastic) has been undone, and I just really hope it's not because Koeman doesn't change it up enough, or that players look good in training then just are totally inept on the field - because they're problems that aren't easily sorted, but sadly they're problems I feel we have right now.  

I want Europe so badly, because it'd be one hell of an experience, but in the second half of the season we've returned to our old selves when Poch was at the reigns - just inconsistent. Only now we lack a couple of the match winners we had then (J-Rod, Lallana).

I think it was a bit of hassle to get it but not because we're foreign, just because of normal british bureaucracy. There was another one of those ""credits"" that she got, a tax one I think, due to her low income.

Every election, we are urged to get out and vote. Every election, we're told that our vote can be more powerful than it has been in a long time. And after every election, the system keeps on chugging along as it did before.

For a long time, people have known, deep down, that their vote doesn't matter. This is why many don't bother to vote. Some might show enthusiasm and belief in the democratic ideals but how many will risk their life and livelihood to vote on polling day? Voting is not *that* important.

I mention this out loud and the Cheerleaders for Democracy accuse me of being apathetic and negative. ""People died for your right to vote,"" they say. ""Do them the honour of exercising that right."" No. They didn't die for me. They died for themselves and for their beliefs. I do not share those beliefs.

Jesus died for the Christians. Ostensibly he died for All Mankind but is it socially acceptable for Christians to tell Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus or Muslims to go to church because Jesus died for their sins? No. Yet believers in the secular religion of Democracy feel entitled to tell everyone that they need to pray regularly at the altar of the State.

Followers of the Cult of the State say I'm simply being lazy or disinterested in world affairs. Just this week, a US-based company asked me to do some work which I quoted up to $3,000 USD. We were on the verge of signing the contract but the company required I sign an IRS form related to US tax withholding. I told them that the IRS had no authority over a British Citizen running a British company performing work on British soil. I have no obligation to the US Government while working in my own country. They insisted so I declined the work.

It was a simple form and the company had kindly pre-filled all the details. All I needed to do was sign my name and they would give me their business. $3,000 USD is not a huge amount but it's not small either. Frankly, I could have done with the extra money. I voted when I turned it down. That's how I cast my vote, routinely throughout the year during the course of my day-to-day life. And yet I'm called apathetic by people who think freedom means queuing up every few years to tick boxes. How many times would they take part in the process if it cost them $3,000 for the privilege?

Acknowledging the flaws of democracy isn't being apathetic. It's being realistic.

null,false,Mutangw,null,null,null,"The welfare state came to be in the first place because people felt that the poor shouldn't have to rely on charity in order to put food on the table. The main reasons for this were because charities simply didn't have the resources to deal with the issue of poverty themselves (charities were originally some of the biggest proponents of the welfare state), and provision of help from charities varied greatly in different areas. 

Inequality of wealth across the country makes it difficult for charities to be able to provide adequate help across the country. Fundraising in a wealthy suburb is easy, fundraising in a ghetto where food bank demand is far higher is very difficult. A government help programme is far more efficient at providing basic financial support to people. 

Charity resources are better allocated towards giving financial and legal advice and other more personal 1-to-1 help that a central government cannot adequately perform. 

The reliance on food banks symbolises a massive backwards step. People are forgetting why the welfare state exists and what life was like before it came into being.
