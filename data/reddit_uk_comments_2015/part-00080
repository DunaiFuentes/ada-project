What about false advertising or again slader/liable.

I submit this distinction that 'until the bricks are flying its fine' is simply nonsense. And that we have *always* held that certain speed and acts of beliefs can in themselves be harmful to society. So either such freedom truely has not and possibly will not ever exist. Or conversely that construction of it does not attach to reality. 

I'm also hardly advocating a totalitarian single party state, it's a bit disengenous to push that way. I think a lot of socialism is extremely misguided and at times harmful. But thouse branches which don't seek to destroy the very system of political pluralism we live in I have no just grounds for anything more than dislike of.

My point i'm advancing, and I think it fairly plausible, and I am biting the bullet here and accepting the slightly more unpalatable conslusion that namely yes like every political insitution such a move is open to abuse.

But my position is quite plausibly I offer that we should only allow ideologies in our political system that respect the diversity of that political system. Anything that aims to upend our entire legal structure and pluralistic society and replace it with a entirely homogenous arbitary one.

Nope. 

I really don't think thats anything really like advocating some opressive political system and the premises on which that lie that freedom in this sense is either one extreme or not present at all... well the case for that is no where near made i'm afraid.

Nope, they might cause hurt, pain, anger, resentment, terror, alarm... but in themselves they are not harmful.

&gt; What about false advertising or again slader/liable.

Advertising is a business process that has outcomes and consequences tied to it. For example a company I think should be free to say ""Our product will reduce your hair loss by 10%"", however upon the action of purchasing the product, using it, and finding that my hair loss was not in effect reduced, even by 5%, I would have cause to sue the company for the action of mis-selling a product.

Slander and Libel also have consequences attached. Though I'd argue that the current laws around it should be completely scrapped and replaced with something that places a lot more burden of proof on the plaintiff and limits financial compensation to a means-test.

Greece, Italy and some other European nations had been borrowing a lot of money, but they had also been covering up what they were actually borrowing. Banks would make payments to the government and in return the government would pay them back in the future with interest, this was not documented and was pretty fucking dodgy. The reason they did this is because in 1992 the Eu signed a treaty that would limit deficits and debt to stop people doing this exact thing, so what Italy and Greece did is borrow from banks off the books (Italy borrowed from US banks) so they could meet their deficit target, and spend more than they're allowed. 

They were claiming that there deficit was 6%, but when they got caught and their debt was revised it turned out to be 13.6%, the highest in the Eu, with Iceland in 2nd and Britain in third.

When the fuckers in Greece were caught, because their borrowing rates were so high they were in basic terms ""cut out from the market"", basically they were not allowed access to the market. So, to get Greece acess to the market again to get their economy going they were given a 110bn euro bail out by other Eurozone members and in return they had to introduce very strict austerity measures (Like what the UK is doing, just spending cuts and higher taxes, however the UK has mostly cut spending). These austerity measure (which have been criticized as being cruel) are being overseen by the European central bank and European commission. However the austerity does seem to be working, there is growth and debt reduction, but people are still pissed and rioting.

Other factors played in too, such as the Euro inflating massively (where as the UK pound sterling did not inflate nearly as much, so fuck the Euroe right in the arse) and the great recession of 2009 which I won't even begin to go into because pointing the blame is like trying to catch a chicken, however US private debt played a major role.",null,0,null,1425248170,null,0,false,0,cp17bu6,null,t3_2xk7tk,null,t1_cp17bu6,null,t1_cp15d9k,null,null,null,1427525170,null,1,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,1,null

I'm so sorry to hear what you are going through. Firstly, I would sit down tonight and write down a list of things that you were not happy with about the treatment e.g. enough information given, any staff, and most importantly problems that you have been having with treatment. You could say this to whoever you see tomorrow but you will most definitely need to put this in writing to managerial level or beyond. 

As much as you are in pain and have a lot of frustration, they can only do they're best with the resources and time that they have. I think they're to go with a softer approach to make them sympathise with your situation (possibly that last line of your post) will more likely make them help you than someone who may be possibly be seen as abusing NHS staff who will really not want to help you.

Can you take your distant family friend with you? Would you feel comfortable with that? They would have the knowledge to possible challenge the person treating you rather than you being in the dark about procedures and treatment. 

I think just try to speak to the people in question - explain that you are not happy with the treatment you have received, you have been told by a specialist that they believe it is the wrong one as well as having an impact on your health/life/chances to get pregnant. You also feel disappointed and frustrated that this was your chance on the NHS. Because it has not gone as well as you expected and feel that you perhaps should be given another chance(?!?) 

(Also, if you have had a strict regime to stick to with hormones and what not, emphasise that you have been careful in sticking with these appropriately, in case they challenge you). 

Where you are being treated will also mean you belong to a certain trust: belfast, southern, south eastern, northern, western h&amp;sc trust and you can find out who are the heads of those and even write to them directly? If you aren't happy with their response tomorrow, say to them that you are going to have to take your complaint higher.

This egregious situation lets the wealthiest enjoy privileges without paying their fair dues


Much has changed in the world since William Pitt the Younger was prime minister and the United Kingdom was at war with Napoleon. But among the tax rules laid down by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs there remains a fiscal echo of those vanished days.


The “non-domicile” regime was originally introduced in 1799 to shelter those with foreign property from the UK’s newfangled wartime taxes. More than two centuries later, it still allows those who live in Britain to cite another country as their real domicile. Unlike other residents, they are only obliged to pay British tax on their overseas earnings if they remit that money to the UK.

In bygone days, when many subjects resided in colonies overseas, this may have had some slender justification. In modern Britain, it has none.


The rule is exploited by jet-setters and wealthy business executives to pick and choose the least fiscally burdensome domicile while continuing to enjoy the right to reside and work in Britain. Their numbers have been rising: from 83,000 in 1997 to 116,000 in 2013. Some, such as foreigners temporarily resident in Britain for work, may have a case for doing so. Far more dubious are cases where the individual is a long-term UK resident, or a British citizen who has elected — either through inheritance or from choice — to domicile themselves in a low-tax country.


This anomaly has been highlighted in recent days by the case of HSBC’s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver. While a British citizen born and raised in the UK, Mr Gulliver badged himself as domiciled in the low-tax haven of Hong Kong. Yet not only has Mr Gulliver worked in Britain for the past 12 years, he has also retained links with the UK, for instance sending his children to school there. Whether or not the arcane rules have been obeyed, this hardly counts as severing all ties.
It is hard to know how much the Treasury is losing out. There are no reliable figures for tax foregone. But the inherent unfairness of allowing the richest in society to avoid paying their fair share of tax has become a matter of fierce public irritation.


Tolerance was fraying even before the financial crisis. The Treasury looked at abolishing non-dom status on several occasions. But each time it drew back for fear of the consequences for Britain’s economy and the City of London in particular. These fears, however, are overdone.


Those who defend the status quo argue it promotes inward investment because wealthy non-doms build up assets in the UK simply by being here. Were it scrapped, they say, these individuals would leave, taking their enterprise and what UK tax they pay.


But in reality non-doms have few incentives to engage in UK activity. The chancellor George Osborne may have introduced measures to encourage them to remit from abroad to invest. But for the most part bringing offshore cash into Britain simply ensures that it will be taxed at UK rates.


As for the idea that abolition will trigger a flood of non-doms seeking sanctuary in Switzerland, some footloose individuals may leave. But the many advantages of London as a financial centre do not dissolve simply because of a change in a hitherto generous tax treatment of resident non domiciles. Low-tax cantons cannot match the City’s deep pool of financial expertise or the excitement of London life.


Both main political parties have recognised the indefensibility of the regime. But rather than abolish it, they have sought to raise its cost. Annual charges of £30,000 are levied on people who have been in the UK for more than seven years, rising to £50,000 (soon to be £60,000) for those with over 12 years’ residence. But while these have cut the take-up, they have not dealt with the intrinsic unfairness.


Britain should sweep away the archaism that allows people to claim a domicile that differs from nationality or residence. Few other civilised countries feel the need to offer such privileges to the wealthy. Liability to taxation should be solely based on residence. There can still be a grace period for foreign nationals posted temporarily to the UK before they are obliged to pay British tax.
More than two centuries after the introduction of income tax by Mr Pitt, his successors should end the egregious situation where the wealthiest enjoy the privileges of UK residency without paying their fair dues to the exchequer. The anomaly of non-dom status cannot be defended. It should be scrapped.

I have rattled on about Joe and been very very critical. But I have to take my medicine today. He was absolutely tremendous. Economical touches, ballwinning all over the field and pivoting/distributing like a boss all game. He shut me the fuck up and if he continues to play like that I will gladly come back to sing his praises. Was instrumental in today's win and likely would be MOTM if not for the insane game Phil (and to a less obvious extent Raheem) played.

Outside of Joe, what can you say about Phil that isn't obvious. He was unbelievable all day with his passing, positioning and pace. The worldy was just the cherry on top. 

Hendos goal was inspired and fantastic. If he and Phil take confidence from recent games and are going to consistently add goals to their game they are scary players, particularly Couts because that was the only glaring hole in his repertoire. 

Raheem put in a helluva shift as well, although to a more subtle extent. He picks up the assist but I really enjoyed his movement, work rate and seeing him knock Kompany to the turf even if he's about 8 inches shorter. Also, seeing him track all the way back on that City counter to help break up a breakway was not only incredibly important in today's game but speaks to his commitment going forward.

But it makes me wonder why Martinez seems to lack the ability to just be a bit tougher.  Maybe he is and we don't know it, but his ebullience after terrible defeats seems to indicate he's the kinda guy to pat you on the shoulder and say ""well, it's ok.""  

Fergie seemed to have that great ability to be harsh and tough, but still empowering.  The guys constantly mention that they felt like they were pushed to play at their best - not just be yelled at and told they suck.  It's similar to Herb Brooks and the 1980 USA hockey team.  I know Fergie is known for blowing out his players, but he seems to know how to do it in a motivating way - he once told Tim Howard ""This isn't the MLS"", and Timmy cites that as one of the turning points in his career, even if it sucked to hear.  I'd say that's pretty motivating.

I feel like Roberto's the guy who would hand out participation trophies if he could. I want him to succeed, and I don't want him to put Everton players on blast in public, but at some point I just wish he'd say ""we're really disappointing and we need people to step up.""  We're all adults here.

The best managers/coaches in ANY sport are the ones who ALWAYS feel a sense of urgency to improve, play at the highest level, etc, rather than just go ""eh, well, onto the next one"" when things are going poorly.  I fear his attitude is going to be his detriment.

I was born and raised in London, my dad and mum went from from proper working class backgrounds to being... I'd say reasonably well-off, not rich or anything but they own their own house and can afford to live rather comfortably with two-three holidays a year in their retirement!

They're both staunch conservatives, both were fans of Thatcher and from what little I know of Thatcher's years, my parents were fans of her for the no-nonsense 'get on with things' attitude she took with the unions et al, I think it was more a 'the unions are a cancer that need to be cut out' attitude (before someone jumps on me, we're talking back then, I know most unions are decent thesedays) and they felt that given how far previous governments had let things declined that she was the right person to sort things out.

Most people in London seemed a-ok with Thatcher, but I live in Wales now and mentioning her name is liable to get you buried in the coal mines without a budgie. But... I don't agree with some of the reasoning they use; yeah, she closed down unprofitable coal mines and pits, yeah she stood up to the unions and so on...

But usually when I sit down and talk with the younger people (who wouldn't have been working etc then) they seem to talk about how it was bad and things were really bad and they trot out the lovely lines such as 'There is no society' (which in context is very much true) and/or 'oh she snatched the milk!!!', and they have this irrational obsession with the Labour Government - I'm not saying Labour are bad or whatnot, but usually a Thatcher-hater tends to be a Conservative-hater  and a Labour-lover - and I always bring up the Labour Government prior to Thatcher, the winter of discontent and all that which, she had to follow on from and its usually presented with that information that they suddenly go 'well.. um....' and have no real retort as to what specifically she did that made her so 'bad'.

Maybe its different for the older generation, the ones who DID live through her regime, but the youngsters do make me wonder if they just nickel and dime their parents opinions without knowing truly what made her so 'evulz', and I've always been fascinated by the fact that no one in their right minds seems to be interested in examining the unions, the work industry and the situation that led to the decisions made by Thatcher and give it a fair shakedown. Seems they're more content with having a villain that can be pointed at, regardless of the reasons. ""Coal pit 1 closed down"" blame thatcher, doesn't matter the whys and whatfors of it.

I think's it's absolutely crucial to put this loss into a grander perspective because it clarified a lot of the work we need to do going forward, and held a lot of positives while also exposing some fault lines. We played well today, particularly our midfield. Bentaleb bossed the midfield, and Mason was on top of things where middle of the pitch is concerned. He squandered many a shot, but he showed great understanding with the defense tracking back. 

Their goals resulted from fluke moments, from literally one second of poor marking on the free kick, and a really unfortunate deflection off Kyle's toe. Our backline for the most part performed very well and stood out as such.

We encountered the most problems going forward as Kane was silenced all match, Eriksen couldn't find support in the box, etc. I don't think we can attribute our lack of end product to anything other than a frankly stellar Chelsea defense. The pressure they applied in the box overwhelmed every channel time and time again.

While I'm gutted at the result, it belies the performance we put in. The second concession was particularly painful, but we remained competitive the whole time. We demonstrated a substantial amount of collective belief as a team and pushed up until the bitter end.

The most surprising performance today was from the ref, who called a strange game. He set it up to be scrappy, but called free kicks on really soft challenges and let harder tackles go unattended.

While frustrated and feeling down about the loss, we can draw positives and have reason to believe in the changes the Pochettino is effecting at the club. Gone are the days of shuffling the ball around the box with no penetrative moment inside, and the creaky high line that fails the offside trap and doesn't get back. We have a proper team of players who believe in what they're doing, and it feels good in a way it hasn't felt since our CL run.

Have a look at Fig.2 in [this article from 2000](http://www.idmu.co.uk/pdfs/drugtest.pdf), which is from an earlier study from 1991. Old papers, but I'm afraid I finished my pharmacology degree in 2000 and stopped paying as much attention. But what was true then ought to be still true today. 

It's worth pointing out that that study used subjects who'd inhaled 11mg of THC, and the pharmacokinetics are such that the amount in your saliva will be proportional to the rate of elimination by your metabolism. That varies from individual to individual, and also crucially, is dependent on how much THC you absorbed in the first place.

null,false,Bacon_is_not_france,null,null,null,"Very simply:

The Greek banks had borrowed large amounts of money during the economic boom years, which was used to finance a huge construction boom in Greece. Like many other banks all over the world, their collateral for the debts included large numbers of repackaged sub-prime mortgage debts from the USA.

When the sub-prime bubble burst and the credit crunch set in, many of the Greek banks (along with many other banks all over the world) suddenly found themselves unable to borrow enough money to finance their day-to-day outgoings. In plain simple terms, they were bankrupt.

The government of Greece decided it couldn't afford to allow many of its biggest banks to go under, so loaned them the money to keep trading. As a comparatively small economy the Greek government could only do this by borrowing money itself. Presumably they expected the recession to last only a short time, and then once economic growth returned they could afford to pay back the loans.

However as we know the recession wasn't short-lived, and the organisations which had lent money to the Greek government started wanting to be repaid. But the global economic situation, together with a traditionally large and generous public-sector employee count and a widespread culture of tax evasion, meant the Greek government didn't have enough money to pay back the people it owed.

So effectively the Greek government bailed out its banks and in the process bankrupted itself.

Greece's creditors have agreed to write off large amounts of the loans, and to defer repayment on much of the rest, but the penalty they've imposed on Greece for doing this is for it to make its economy much more competitive. Effectively the Greek government has been ordered to reduce public pensions, reduce salaries and increase taxation, and the result of this ""shock treatment"" has been to cause a huge increase in unemployment and a huge contraction of the Greek economy.

null,false,Edward_Elgar,null,null,null,"&gt; Just as a random side question, What's your stance on the UK being a part of the EU? My thoughts are, As long as Britain is still and always remains self governed and doesn't adopt the Euro, we're all good.

I'm for being part of the free market, but not for being part of the Eu. Eu law has supremacy over English law. Meaning if the Eu introduces a new law, we HAVE to adopt it and if we have laws that contradict the new Eu law, we HAVE to change ours. I don't agree with this whatsoever, I think we should make every single one of our laws. 

I also don't like being part of the European court of human rights, it undermines our law and our beliefs. For example, people in Britain by a majority do not believe prisoners should have the vote (https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/11/25/public-says-no-prison-votes/) by in accordance to ECHR law we're breaking human rights by not granting them the vote. Which is a problem when the people who make your laws are not voted by you or in the same country with the same beliefs, philosophy and government system. I would like to see the UK leave the ECHR and replace it with our own bill of rights. For the past 1000 years England has been the forefront in law, there is no reason why we still can't.

Other reasons as I don't like being part of the Eu is the Eu commission, which is not a publicly elected commission that only has the power to create bills. MEP's (that we choose to represent us) cannot make bills, only vote on them. Other is the Euro, which is weak and hurts competition in the market, I also don't like the pressure applied by Germany to join the euro zone. I also don't like freedom of movement, I think countries in the Eu shouldn't be forced to accept immigrants and should be allowed to set their own border limits, something the UK public overwhelmingly what. I wouldn't mind being part of the Eu so long as it was nothing more than countries with free trade among each other, but that isn't what it is anymore and I don't like it. I think Britain should honestly turn its sights onto the commonwealth, set up our own free trade areas with the commonwealth and set up our own laws which countries that share exactly our same governments and law systems.

The commonwealth is also growing economically and mostly speaks English, unlike the Eu that is mostly not growing or actually decreasing and has to employ a man to speak 35 languages just to translate everything.",null,0,null,1425251127,null,0,false,0,cp18xti,null,t3_2xk7tk,null,t1_cp18xti,null,t1_cp1879f,null,null,null,1427525921,null,2,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,2,null

1. You say that 'of course kids know these words exist', as if they are inherently born with a vocabulary.  Clearly they're not.  Clearly they need to learn that these words exist.  And, assuming the parent(s) of the child do not teach them whilst out of school, who will?  The teacher?  The teacher is just trying to do their best under difficult circumstances.  And if they're working from a syllabus that determines what words are to be taught, is there room for those extra, 'non-official' words?

2. I read the linked article and couldn't see any suggestion that this was being driven by any 'corporate/PR takeover'.  Lets try not to see demons where there are none.  This appears to be OUP's decision based on a desire to include more modern words at the expense of other words.

I don't think he has been lacking form or confidence, but his role has shifted slightly. 

Last season Martinez prefered to play a defensive winger in at least one spot (be it Pienaar or Osman, most often) and have Barry cover the other slot- which allowed an insanely aggressive use of the overlap.

This season however Barry has been short of pace, and we have played a traditional forward thinking winger and an inside forward (I presume so we have someone at the back post, as it is not what Lukaku is good at). This had led to Coleman having to be more considerate about his positioning, and led him not to go forward as much. 

When Lennon has played however, it has been a different story. Lennon works hard to track back, and often Coleman is ahead of him- working the same overlap he did last year, where he would aggressively move into hugely dangerous areas.

I feel that once they build a better understanding, Lennon will allow Coleman to really open up. If they play together more, I would be surprised if Coleman didn't get another three from now till the end of the season.

What worries me more about UKIP is their buried policies, Such as, If they get into power all Environmental regulations will be scrapped, Fossil fuels will be burned in the UK again. They also fully support Fracking which does untold damage to the environment, not to mention it pollutes the underground fresh water reservoirs... and they actively promote this.

That's what scares me about UKIP more than the shallow ""they're racist"" claims... I don't think they're racist, they're just clearly businessmen... that want to make money and will screw up Britain, putting us into a Victorian era Smog again. They're the equivalent of the American Republican party... after reading their manifesto, they're further right-wing than Cameron and his shits.

People were saying that Southampton had outmaneuvered us in the transfer window but I consider Sadio Mané to be the only noteworthy one younger than 25. Pellè was in form, but he's 29 and his form has already dropped from where it was when he was looking like such a good signing. Dušan Tadić should definitely have some good seasons, but otherwise it's starting to feel like their transfers were made just to make an indent in the top 4 in the first 75% of the season, and I don't know if they can do that again unless they can climb back in to 5th (at the expense of Manchester United fingers crossed).

Lazar hasn't been consistently great, but has definitely shown some great moments/energy, looked like our defibrillator in the Champions League (before blowing the fuse box) and is still only 20, so the fact that he hasn't been standing out with the rest of the team doing so well and Ibe emerging isn't really a bad thing. Can cost 12 million Euros and has been worth it for so much more than just his hair, still only 21. Rickie aside, Lallana and Lovren and Balotelli are the oldest of our transfers, and they're 26, 25 and 24 respectively, and even when/if their form is down, they've still got so much to prove and so long in which to prove it.

The fact that we're looking capable of 3rd now makes me so excited that my consistent optimism is looking so justified. Raheem should only get more likely to sign as we keep winning, and I can see Liverpool looking like a very attractive place for young world star players to grow, and I can see us getting a few Ødegaards of our own.

null,false,DrBort,null,null,null,"Hi.  You might remember me as a little well-wisher on your last post.  I can't imagine the anguish , anger and hurt you feel right now.  As a GP (definitely not a fertility expert) I do have a friendly suggestion for you that I hope will make tomorrow a better experience.

Just.. I know it might be hard, but don't go in all guns blazing ready to give them hell about how they've done A and B wrong.  By all means put it to them what you were told, but step one is to find out if what your relative told you is indeed correct- for you - or not.  If I'm being very honest I think it could be unlikely that they've given you the 'wrong' treatment (though of course I could be wrong myself on this), even despite your relative's input and despite them being an expert.  Major things like this being done outright wrongly in the NHS is actually rare enough.  The doctors you've been seeing are fertility experts too, who, unlike your relative, have seen you, all your blood tests, all your scans, and all your medical notes, and they know what the local guidelines are and what kinds of treatments are funded in NI.

Doctors giving off-the-cuff medical advice to friends, relatives, whoever are often wrong.  If you don't see and examine the patient yourself, believe me, you will be wrong A LOT.  Also, it has to be mentioned that the RoI healthcare system is different in many, many ways - not least that it's essentially privatised.

Be nice and be calm and if you don't feel listened to after it all, a complaint usually gets you much farther that an unpleasant argument on the day.

So very sorry to hear the treatment hasn't worked.  Hope you get on well tomorrow.  Best wishes and do let us know how it goes? :-)",null,0,null,1425254008,null,0,false,0,cp1aep1,null,t3_2xl9c2,null,t1_cp1aep1,null,t3_2xl9c2,null,null,null,1427526607,null,13,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,13,null

He's a few harsh lessons from being a very good manager, it just may be that one of those lessons will be getting sacked by Everton because he wasn't willing to adapt his approach and it crippled his results.

We saw what he can do last year. Remember that David Moyes had a very good first season with us, then we finished 17th but there wasn't as much outcry back then because we were still used to the Walter Smith standards. After that, Moyes took what he'd learned and we finished 4th the following season, he went on to get pretty much the best out of the players for the following 7-8 years.

Now I believe Roberto has a higher glass ceiling than Moyes did, what remains to be seen is if he's willing to learn his lessons and adapt as a manager rather than remaining convinced that his way is the way he's going to stick to - he'd be a fool to believe he's got the whole thing cracked when he's such a young manager still. I have my doubts over whether he'll change his philosophy and allow himself to grow as a manager, increasingly as I watch us lose in what seems to be the same fashion again and again this season, but I've not given up on him yet.

If you buy your vegs and fruits at Sainsbury's, or any chain store in fact they might be overpriced too. I discovered that I can cut my veg and fruit spendings in half or less by buying them in small shops, the kind which you easily pass by on the street cause they're so tiny. I don't know what they're called in english though, but you probably know which ones I mean. See if you have any of them nearby and compare some prices. Anyways, I pick up avocadoes for like 40p a piece and they're awesome. Much better quality even than Tesco's rock hard ones for 1 pound.

Just a few minor things that might also be at play are, like you said Yogurts. I don't know if you buy flavored and branded ones, but yeah, they can be very pricey. I tend to buy unflavored, nobrand greek yogurt and just mix it up with a bit of jam or honey. Same flavor, less garbage like colorings and added sugar and also a lot cheaper.

I do the same for pasta sauces and the likes. Buy tomato puree or sauce and just mix in some crushed garlic with spices. Spices are probably the most expensive part, but they'll last a long time.

The thing is, we have only got to this stage because we initially paid for a private consultation with a fertility expert who then got us referred to a Dr. At Craigavon hospital. Before that,  we were with the Royal. They were useless. We've had 5 miscarriages during that time, and they offered no treatment and just told us to keep trying. 

Craigavon have been so much more positive and helpful. I can only suggest that you cancel your IVF until you can possibly get a referral to speak to a different consultant about your situation.

null,false,Edward_Elgar,null,null,null,"&gt; So what's your stance with parties like UKIP popping up?

Used to support them, stopped recently after feeling like the party attracts too many racists, extremists and I didn't like their stance on climate change and I was skeptical about the party actually claiming it supports the NHS as much as it claims. However in general, I think UKIP getting a bit of popularity is a good thing, it shakes up the two major parties in constituencies they've took for granted and it forces them onto issues they recently wouldn't talk about. So long as UKIP doesn't get more then 20 MP's (which is almost impossible), it's fine I think, their support is dropping anyway which is probably for the best. Like you I didn't like their stance on the enviroment, I do support fracking and mining, but only with massive regulations and I do support loosening the carbon tax, however UKIP just doesn't seem interested in investing money into better alternative technologies and fuels or doing research on climate change. The only thing I liked was their support for nuclear power which doesn't release CO2.

Their message on a more diverse, but more limitied immigration system and restoring British patriotism is a good one, however their other policies which are either a fantasy, undesirable or generally miss-informed ruin the message. This country certainly needs to be reminded of its culture and law, instead of trying to promote multiculturalism (which as resulted in multi-division), but I don't think UKIP is the party to do it. I tend to follow the more back bench Tories such as Jacob rees mog (Who I was disappointed by on his recent stance on 3 parent babies), Daniel Hannan and Owen Paterson. I like those MP's, it's just a shame they're run by the gimps in the cabinet.

The two best things you can do (if you don't already) are plan your meals before you go shopping and don't buy lunch out everyday. I usually cook extra at dinner and have it for lunch the next day. 

How much freezer space do you have?  I have one drawer in an average size freezer and I can manage buying all my meat and most of my Veg frozen, and the occasional meal I cooked in advance. 

Things like [this](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/frozen-chicken/sainsburys-chicken-portions--basics-25kg) are great value, as are things [like this] (http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/frozen-vegetables/sainsburys-carrots--baby-1kg). I spent about £4 on buying 3 bags of frozen veg a month ago and I still enough left to do me at least another week. 

Try to have one veggie meal a week or use slightly less meat in a recipe and bulk it up with Veg, this is also healthier for you. 

You can also obviously buy things like rice, pasta and potatoes very cheaply. 

You can still get treats too in that budget, I buy a pack of biscuits for about 50p each week and stock up on crisps when they're on offer. I also bake my own treats sometimes.

Don't see Can as a Lucas-style player - his ability to play in the opponent's half would be wasted if he had to sit in this team. At least as a RCB he can bomb forward knowing that there's 2 CB covering him still. He'll continue at RCB in the 3-4-3 or CM alongside Henderson and Lucas in a 4-3-3. 

So we need:  

* A backup to Lucas / competition for Allen. Not a specialist CDM like Lucas, but someone who can win tackles, recycle like Allen and is more mobile than Lucas  
* A striker if we expectedly sell Borini and Lambert - this will probably be Ings. If we can move on Balotelli for someone with pace to burn, we will do so, otherwise I fully expect Balotelli to go out on loan unless he dramatically improves (which he might do) or unless Origi is close to ready to play (which I doubt he will be)
* RB/RWB to replace Johnson, who will leave

I'm not sure what Enrique's role is - he's a good backup but injuries are catching up with him. Hopefully Flanno makes a full recovery so we can use him as a more defensive / stronger alternative to Moreno.

I did, in reference to the richest 0.5%.

&gt;You are simply inventing your own definitions now.

No I'm not.

Wealth is the accumulative value of your estate, i.e. everything in your possession. Earning 75k does not make you wealthy. It makes you well off, whether the money you earn is then used to further your wealth is irrelevant. 

It is you who is confusing definitions, you're the one interchanging wealth and income as if they're even remotely the same thing. They're not.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"Elsewhere I mentioned my neighbour at my last address - it was a city centre apartment in a nice, quiet street. There were two working girls that shared this flat, they each used it 2 or 3 days a week - they rented it from the same lettings agency I did, so I happen to know they'd been there several years (possibly more than a decade), and there were never any problems.

One day I found a note through my door - I can't remember if it was handwritten or inkjet printed, but it was not highly eloquent - it exposed my neighbours' work, denounced them as disgusting and (if I recollect) called on local residents to join in harassing them.

A few weeks later, my neighbour moved out - she'd had a quiet visit from the plod, and that was the end of it. I believe that because the flat was used by more than one girl, that made it legally a bawdy house or a brothel or whatever, so she had no leg to stand on if they'd decided to make a fuss about it.

I assume that the denouncement and the harassment were made by a new resident moving into the street - the only way you'd know my neighbours were sex workers is that you'd occasionally see a man ringing their doorbell, or the door being answered by a woman in a little black dress. It would probably have taken me a long time to cotton on, had I not been clued in by the friendly lettings agency. I lived there several years, and there was never any trouble.

I'm pretty sure that those who think sex work is disgusting are the same people who don't want to support lazy layabouts on the dole, a position I find morally irreconcilable. We expect people to work for a living, but only stacking shelves in Tesco is good enough for them - they're not allowed to do these jobs that we don't like.

Three managers and three seasons on, we still suffer under the same basic game plans of our opponents.  I was really hoping to see a more fluid, team-based style of play emerge this season with Poch, but it seems we're just as reliant on Kane or Eriksen being brilliant as we were on Bale under AVB.

null,false,hamster_dingles,flair3,,null,"While agree with part of your assessment, insofar as we get punished on counters for not finishing clear cut chances, we absolutely do not get dismantled the same way.

Defensively we are much more resolute this season than we have been, in part because our back line is pacier and fitter, but also because our midfield provides protection. We concede primarily from lapses in judgment and sometimes costly individual errors, whereas under AVB and Sherwood we played a high line with virtually no midfield pressure, and teams could just poke in a through ball and we'd try to play the offside trap and fail, and not track back in time.

I'm not sure in what realm of existence you can say that we do not play as a team and are overly reliant on the creative talent of Eriksen or Kane's finishing at the expense of fluid team play. Poch's setup relies on everyone fulfilling a very specialized role to their absolute end and if the parts aren't there, they break down. That's why the midfield pivots are so important, that's why Danny is always an attacking option, that's why Mason overlaps on defensive duties and wins balls further up the pitch, why Bentaleb harasses everyone in the central third, etc. The cogs in a machine metaphor has not been so apparent in determining players roles since Jol, honestly. Under Poch, losing the ball doesn't mean as much, but our possession relies on moving the ball fast. It might often be wasteful, and we can give it up in weird places (so long as we recover it quickly), but it is not by any means stagnant.

Today, we were stymied by, frankly put, a stellar defensive display that had the entire 18-yard box covered, and a setup that harassed any of our attackers immediately upon their first touch of the ball. They shut Kane out of the game completely. Incisive passing wasn't working, as no one could make runs into the box while retaining possession, which we tried to no avail before turning to crosses into the box (which we were unlucky not to connect with--Chadli's trailing leg comes to mind).

Structurally, we are very different from our past two seasons and rely more than ever on a collective effort, which is why the dressing room egos have been marginalized. Possession can be wasteful, but it is never lethargic, and our defense, though not by any means perfect, is more resolute structurally in being able to deal with quick breaks from a high line positioning. 

So yeah, we get hit quickly on the counter, but the mechanics of it are quite different. Of course we have a long way to go, most of our first team is 24 or under, they're adapting to yet another manager whose system they clearly believe in. The pieces are there to build upon.

What saddens me most about the match (and the last five matches really) is how few chances we're able to create in the box.  We just don't look very threatening.  Even when we do score, they're often chances from further than 15 yards out.  We hardly ever create true poacher's goals, which is a big problem.

He at least offered some penetration and thrust from defence into attack, which hardly anyone else did.  A switch to the left could've been worth a try, but Poch is nothing if not rigid in his formations.

I agree on Lamela's potential.  The problem is that he is either kind of amazing, or completely woeful.  He gives the ball away A LOT, which is sometimes necessary if you want to have ambition, but he gives it away in completely needless situations too.  It's one thing losing it to audacious through balls... it's another to lose it on simple passes or just from running straight into a player.

I can't believe that we have gone two transfer windows this season and not only failed to bolster our attack, but actively shed options from the bench (Siggy, Holtby, Lennon) that could be extremely handy in crowded months like this last one.  I can understand Levy playing it safe with Poch and not wanting to over-invest until the manager has proven himself somewhat, but to let January slip without anything happening was a huge mistake in my mind.  Especially if Poch's decided that Ade and Capoue are never going to play for us again.

Poch's squad management and substitutions are his biggest flaws with us so far, and I think they really need addressing before next season starts.  I hope he gets more time, but I also don't think he's addressed some of the fundamental issues that plagued AVB.  This season could easily slip away from us very quickly, as all we've got is the league and we're not going very well in it at present (results overnight going against us didn't help).  I hate to say it, but unless Poch give us a strong run-in or a good start to next season, I could easily see him being another casualty to Levy's trigger-finger halfway through next campaign.",null,0,null,1425264105,null,0,false,0,cp1fovz,null,t3_2xku2w,null,t1_cp1fovz,null,t1_cp0zv5k,null,null,null,1427529141,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

We gave up some decisive late goals early in that season, but AVB recognised the problem and then rectified it and we were much more resolute from that point on.

Plus, we had wins agains Utd away and City at home that were just as thrilling and important as this season's wins against Chelsea and Arsenal (both of which were at home, by the way).

I'm not defending AVB, and I'm glad he's gone, but I don't see a significant up-tick in quality between his first season and Poch's.  The way we play is different, yes, but the end result is alarmingly similar.  We can't break down compact sides, we often boss possession to little effect, we are glaringly short in specific squad roles, we hardly ever have shots from inside the box, we maddeningly stick to using inverted wingers even though they only further cluster the middle of the pitch, we are vulnerable to fast, direct plays.

Poch has clearly improved our fitness and mentality, and that's great.  I celebrate that.  But he has played pretty much the exact formation all season despite it very rarely resulting in compelling football... something that AVB was guilty of doing.

I'm not saying they're exactly the same type of manager.  They're clearly not.  But there are endemic issues at the club that Poch hasn't really come close to resolving.  His Southampton side played a lot better football and had much more cohesive team play that we do.

Note that there's nothing in there about 'residency'.  In fact, in the guidance notes, they explicitly say:

residence status, …

In other words, it's not about how _long_ you are in the UK, but about where you're (allegedly) permanent home is.  This is the aspect that makes it seem weird - were it as simple as splitting the tax based on fraction of time resident, that would be one thing.  Non-dom's are _resident_ in the UK, but don't pay tax here….

As it stands, as far as I can see, there is no requirement for a non-dom to _actually_ spend time outside the UK.

How do we get the opponent to set up against us differently? If the answer is width, then only part of that is Poch-people were let go by Mitchell and Baldini, we have no money considering the stadium is a season or two away from being built, and our best prospects are away on loan. Can we see Paulinho trying to cross into Harry Kane's head? Can we see Andros crossing period? That's a problem either waiting to be fixed in the summer in line with what Poch wants (case in point being Lamela. Decent amount of assists and a pretty good tackler, but virtually no finishing since the start of the season) or the system changes. 

&gt;but it seems we're just as reliant on Kane or Eriksen being brilliant as we were on Bale under AVB.

Everybody at our level or above has the goalscoring duos. City have any of their multitude of their strikers. Chelsea has Costa and everyone in the front three only plays a bit part. Scum have Giroud and Alexis. Liverpool looked a shell of themselves before Sturridge, Sterling and Coutinho linked up again. United would be nowhere without Rooney at this point. 

Why is this a problem unique to us? What convention are we breaking? Are any of Mourinho, Pelligrini, Rodgers, Wenger or Van Gaal wrong too? Does it come down to the club's fundamental insecurity that if Kane and Eriksen perform to their potential, they'll get a ""big move""?

That's not even considering the rest of the teams. From Berahino to Charlie Austin to Danny Ings and even Chamakh, every team has its talisman. That's not dependence to toxic degrees. That's strikers doing their job of finishing. 

I don't think that our team is the finished product and I've enjoyed it just as much as anybody, but sorry, these two points apply to everyone else in the Sky 6/7 and they drop stupid points too (again, Chelsea vs. Newcastle, Liverpool against Villa, Stoke beating City at home, Southampton losing to West Brom, Arsenal against Swansea, United against Southampton, take your pick). 

The difference between us and them isn't really a problem in system (if it were, we'd be ahead of United and Arsenal's schizophrenic ""pass it everywhere"" to ""counter anywhere faces this season), the difference is a lack in quality. We've got lots of dead weight that Poch hasn't learned to manage, but past that, the system has worked against smaller teams in spite of the hiccups early in the season.

--------------------Sturridge 

We don't need to go out and buy four or five. We just need to reinforce one or two positions. We need a new first team striker to challenge Sturridge, and a top midfielder to play alongside Henderson. 

We're not getting Vidal, but we need someone similar. Or someone like Koke, who's not like Vidal, but is more sophisticated on the ball than Henderson, and pick a better pass, but can also mix it up. I'd throw £35 million at Koke because I think he's a type of player we lack.  A classy, technically gifted midfielder. I like the idea of Can only moving into the middle if we're chasing the game. That back three have a great relationship and I don't think you break it up because ""Can is a midfielder."" 

Next we need a 20 goal striker because Mr Glass' fitness is far too unreliable. Forget the months and months injured, it's the four or five games where he's shit, but needs to play to get his sharpness back, that's the problem. We can't have any passengers. The Anfield Wrap guys said that we should essentially write off Sturridge for this season because we've not got the luxury of being able to field a player who's only running at 50%. I agree. He should be focusing on next season now.

Britain always knew that many European countries were good at war and thus wouldn't underestimate them. Often times it wasn't even because we thought they were barbaric and uncivilized that we want to war with nations, it was mostly because they had something we wanted and instead of negotiating and finding common ground we could blast them away in a puff of smoke and take everything we want.  In fact, Britain's has always known that France has always been better at land conflicts (not to do however) and that the European armies were generally larger, thats why we built a pissing giant navy. Britain literally at one point had a policy that the British fleet would have to by law be bigger or the same as the next two biggest fleets combined. Britain was even influenced by French culture and German and French language and all of their religions, today however Britain tends to influence there's (anglophile). 

Even the French were fantastically good at land conflicts and Britain never once underestimated, hence why we used cunning tactics to defeats the frogs. Britain throughout history has very rarely underestimated it's enemy, that's why Britain has won so much, it's always understood it's enemies ability and the possibility that Britain could lose. Where as if you compare it to say the Americans, they storm to a country with a million planes and boats with technology that is hundreds of years more advanced than the enemies, think it will be a peace of cake and then lose.

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;Parliament is sovereign, no government can bind another

This is incorrect.  We do have a fairly complex constitution, and there are things parliament simply does not have the power to do (indeed, one paradox of complete sovereignity is that it can pass laws against passing future laws, so even absolute power does not mean constraints are impossible). That constitution is a complex mess of history, treaties, legal precedent and a lot more and the government **is** indeed bound by these past limitations, so unless you're a legal scholar, I *really* don't think you can be speaking with any confidence about what is, and is not, legal for parliament to do.  Given that you think it can do what it likes, I doubt you're so informed.  Hell, I gave you a straight up example of cases where laws passed by parliament **have** been found illegal by another government (eg. torture and rendition or descrimination cases that have been successfully brought against the UK government in the european courts), because we have signed up to treaties that further limit the powers of the government.  As such, your statement is straight up, provably wrong.

&gt;Tax payer funded handouts to the wealthiest age group is a bad use of public money

That's not a reason, that's a statement.  Further, it's a false statement, in that **not** doing so is demonstrably worse in this case than giving the handout and getting it back in higher taxes.  Hell, there are proposals right now that advocate doing this on a much more wide basis (eg. universal income), simply on the basis that the bureacuracy that this requires is a net loss.

A **bad** use of money would be fighting legal challenges brought against the government reneging on their agreements, the bureacracy required to claim back a tiny amount of money, and the loss of financial confidence and taxpayer base that this would result in, when a far cheaper, more effective and less incredibly stupid way would be to raise taxes.

&gt;But you clearly believe it's more important that we keep funding holidays for wealthy pensioners

Yes.  I think it's important the government doesn't steal people's pensions that they have promised to pay.  I don't think Robert Maxwell is an example we should aspire to in solving our financial issues.

&gt;Infact you think we should raise taxes further to fund it.

No.  We don't need to raise taxes to fund the wealthiest pensionholders.  As I mentioned, that is *trivial* amount in comparison to the issue.  Hell - those people have actually covered their own costs and *more* with *their* NI contributions.  We need those taxes for *everyone else*.  In fact, we'd need those taxes (or cuts elsewhere) anyway becasuse as I've repeatedly pointed out, your proposal will do absolutely nothing to solve the issue and would likely even make it worse.

And this doesn't even address the point - changing the way pensions are funded is fine - as I mentioned, if a model more in line with other benefits would be better, we could certainly do that.   But that doesn't change the *past* agreements already made - it doesn't justify retroactively change your agreements after you've taken people's money on a completely different basis.",null,0,null,1425272807,null,0,1425287104,0,cp1jzym,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp1jzym,null,t1_cp15i70,null,null,null,1427531150,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Rodgers' system relies on two centre backs either side of Skrtel who are good in possession, which is why Can and Sakho have been great.  I can't wait to Sakho to get back and think taking either him or Can out for an extended period would be disastrous.

&gt;A lock knife is not a folding pocket knife and therefore it is illegal to carry around such a knife regardless of the length of the blade **(if you do not have reasonable excuse).** A lock knife means a knife which is similar to a folding knife, in that there is a spring holding the blade closed. However, a lock knife has a mechanism which locks the blade in position when fully extended, the blade cannot be closed without that mechanism being released. A lock knife is not an offensive weapon per se (because these knives were made with a specific purpose in mind and not as a weapon). However, possession of a lock knife in a public place **without reasonable excuse** is an offence.

&gt; Possession of a multi-tool incorporating a prohibited blade/pointed article is capable of being an offence under this section even if there are other tools on the instrument which may be of use to a person in a public place (screwdriver, can opener).

&gt; **The ban is not total, it is for the person in possession of such an instrument to prove on the balance of probabilities that he/she had good reason for its possession. It will have to be genuine, for example, someone back packing across the Lake District may reasonably be expected to have a knife for the preparation of meals. It will be far more difficult to justify on the streets of a city or town, but there will be occasions when someone is genuinely going to a martial arts sport or scout meeting (which is easily checked).**

I love awkward!Gwen. She is just the cutest. I've always thought it was weird that she and Merlin are so flirty in the first few episodes and then it's just gone all of a sudden, though.

Poor Merlin is so idealistic, and Gaius comes off like such a jerk even though he's super right about not using magic in these circumstances. Merlin needs that lesson like crazy though, he absolutely sucks at looking before he leaps.

Every time Arthur clashes with Uther about magic, it really bums me out. He's open to the idea that magic could be good, and willing to stand up to Uther about it. Merlin, you dummy, just tell him the truth already, and the whole thing will turn out better! Damn!

My tinfoil-y theory for this episode is - Arthur already knows about the magic! When Merlin confesses to being a sorcerer, Arthur immediately intervenes. The way he talks, though, you can tell that he doesn't believe what he's saying. He says all slow at the end of his little speech, ""There's no way he's a sorcerer"" but he's not looking at Uther, he's looking at Merlin.

Looking at your past comments you seem to be Australian, so why would you support Spurs then? Don't try and give me flak about being a foreigner supporting a big team when you do the exact same thing, Spurs are a big team compared to the rest of the teams in England. I didn't choose this team just because they were rich and won a lot, I chose them because I saw players in the team that appealed to me. My family is mostly Czech so I always supported the Czech national team during the World Cup, and after 2010 when I first started really watching football my favourite player became Petr Cech, and I watched Chelsea because of him, fast forward to now and I can't even dream of supporting any team but Chelsea.

If someone supports a team because they're successful who gives a damn, if they start to care about the team and support them no matter what that's what matters, it's not why you support them, it's how you support them and whether or not you would stay with them through the thick and thin.

Don't get me wrong I love HK as much as any other fan but in Bentaleb I see something that I don't really see with any of our academy produced first XI. It's a combination of raw skill and potential to grow that does it for me. 

Our last four games he's consistently been the best player on the pitch for example - more so than Hugo, Mason or Kane. Seeing as CM is the engine of the team, for him to put in such assured performances there and at such a young age speaks volumes about what he'll be able to achieve. I think given the right amount of time and attention we'll have a player who will prove invaluable to us.

At the end of the day this is just my opinion as a fan. Could I be wrong? Yes. But I sure as hell hope that I'm right.

Edit - Just to convince you a little bit more, watch the highlights from Pool - City game yesterday. Pay special attention to Yaya. While City didn't really have the right plan of attack the way Yaya was playing was unreal. The balls he delivered were out of this world at times.

I've worked with many different companies on different contracts and have been given people's opinions on the current economical situation around London from all over. Some people have been more educated than others, but there is a general consensus about the current situation from everyone I've spoken to.


Do we really need a larger population? Can the city itself cope? Building highrise flats is a temporary solution to a problem which shouldn't exist. Your flair says St Albans and yet I don't quite classify that as being very London, not in an obtuse way, but by that there is a cathedral and it's classified as a city in its own right. The center of London however - Tower hill, Edgeware, Shadwell, Shoreditch, Borough, Stockwell, Brixton, Stratford... is absolutely horrific! Especially the living conditions where some people are living 10+ to a 2 bed flat working 12 hours a day every day just to pay rent and send money home. I don't think London is this gleaming ray of hope and prosperity which everyone seems to think it is. I understand that some people have got things better off than others, and for some people the living conditions which they have now are better than what they had - but does that make it right? Does that make it the city which it should be?


London is far too overcrowded. The roads and the transport network in general cannot handle everything which is currently being run over-capacity.

It sounds to me like you don't really understand what parliamentary sovereignty is. It relates to domestic legal affairs. Westminster obviously  isn't sovereign over foreign governments. So presenting examples of the UK government being challenged in the European Courts isn't an example of parliament not being sovereign in the UK. Furthermore, the UK government is only subject to the jurisdiction of the EU courts for as long as it voluntarily remains a member. Parliament could exercise it's sovereignty and leave the EU and no longer be subject to it's laws.

Parliament is sovereign in the UK, and if it were to pass an Act of Parliament dismantling the state pension, no legal challenge could be made. 

So thanks very much for your suggestion about the money you think we're saving in legal fees. But it's of no concern in the grand scheme of things.

I'm also not sure you fully comprehend that pensioners are the wealthiest age group in the UK. As you keep talking about the trivial amount you think we're spending on the ""wealthiesat pensioners"".

I'm not talking about the wealthiest pensioners. I'm talking about the *average* pensioner. Who is wealthier than any other age group in the UK and doesn't need a state pension to support themselves. We would save a vast amount of money by directing that benefit elsewhere.

You also keep talking about ""past agreements"". Past agreements between whom. By their very nature a state pension funded by future taxpayers is not something that those taxpayers can agree to. Today's pensioners *promised themselves* today's taxpayers would fund their pensions. Today's taxpayers didn't.

The Tu-160 is just as new as the B-1. By the standards of strategic bombers, it's new (and in fact was only introduced in 2005 officially).

It is fully up to date, and a *very* capable strategic bomber. If a new one was designed today, it would improve on *nothing* except stealth. In all other ways it is perfectly up to date.

Also what are you talking about on range? They can fly over 12,000 km without refueling!

That means that they could hit *any* target in Europe and still return to Russia with tons of fuel left over.

Not to mention that its main role is missile carrier (like most strategic bombers), and those missiles have a range of 3,000 km.

So I find it *bizarre* for you to criticize the Tu-160 on range. It's range is the same as the B-1 Lancer!

&gt;Strategic bombers aren't that useful in the era of SLBMs etc. a bomber is pretty easy to knock out of the sky, far easier that sinking a sub that can be located anywhere in the world.

Sorry but you don't know what you're talking about.

Strategic bombers today would act as missile carriers in a conventional war.

The missiles have a range of 3000 km.

The missiles used by our aircraft to shoot the bomber down have a range of 100 - 200 km.

You see now the role? The bomber will have fired its missiles and turned around before you can get within range to shoot it down.

Subs have their role, but so do missile carriers. Both would be used together.

&gt;Also since most of them are based in Engles one strike could take out a lot of the fleet.

&gt;The UK hasn't used strategic bombers since the Vulcans were retired the TSR2 was cancelled because there was no need for them after polaris was acquired

That's because we only considered them as *bombers* (in the sense of dropping gravity bombs).

It would be a completely different story for missile carriers.

And it was mainly cost and the fact that they were from the 1950's.

&gt;The Tu-160 is just a PR vehicle for putin, a vanity project.

The Tu-160 force could deliver 120 nuclear missiles onto the UK within a few hours. The aircraft themselves would have fired off the missiles before it's possible to shoot the aircraft down.

You did huh?  And are still completely unaware of stuff like legal challenges to british law that have been made in the EU courts?

&gt;Westminster obviously isn't sovereign over foreign governments

Who said it was?  I said your statement that ""one government can't bind another"" was false, and gave examples of one government binding another (because we've signed treaties that give them that power).

&gt;Parliament could exercise it's sovereignty and leave the EU and no longer be subject to it's laws.

OK *maybe* if we withdraw from every single international treaty or other agreement and scrap any law that might cause us to be required to honor debts and obligations, we could get away with this without being sued.  I think the cost of doing this may be a **little** higher than anything we'd gain though.

&gt;I'm talking about the average pensioner.

Ah, so we're actually talking about stripping most pensioners of their money, rather than just a few.  I'm even less in line with that.  You're not just advocating ripping off those who won't notice, you're doing so for those who it will actually make a difference.  Fair enough - that may make a difference short term (though it's going to discourage anyone from actually saving for their retirement long term), but frankly, at that point you might as well just confiscate their money - there's no real difference.  (And again - still waiting to see why taxing the wealthy in general, rather than this one particular segment, isn't superior in every single way to your proposal).

&gt;Past agreements between whom

Between those who have paid their NI and the government.

&gt;By their very nature a state pension funded by future taxpayers is not something that those taxpayers can agree to

Why not?  One moment you're arguing that the government can do anything it likes, but now it can't even determine where taxpayer money goes?  In any case, the agreement was not between those taxpayers, it was between the past taxpayers - it's a debt the government has incurred, and we don't get to wish that away just because we weren't around, any more than we should be locked out of the infrastructure we weren't around to fund either.  Would you also say we can just dispense with the national debt, if we weren't around then either?  The government is not the taxpayer, and the government is a legal institution that needs to abide by its agreements.

&gt;Today's pensioners promised themselves today's taxpayers would fund their pensions

No, they didn't.  Todays pensioners are not the government.  But they did vote an arrangement between the government and themselves that caused them to pay that government for their entire working lives on the basis that they would receive a specified pension at the end of it.  Just as they created a national health service, funded various infrastructure projects, accumulated national debt, and a bunch of other things that we are still either paying for, or benefitting from.  Pensions are absolutely no different, and there's no more justification for breaking this agreement than for exempting young people from the NHS.

I'm guessing this happened in Somerset, given your tag (and name), and the ""C"" at the start would imply a Welsh car - certainly very plausible, and it's definitely not a W, the code for the South West.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; How do we get the opponent to set up against us differently?

By figuring out how to beat what every team does to us.  That's pretty much the job description of the manager... find a way of out-thinking the opposition.  You think we're the only team in the EPL to encounter teams sitting deep and hitting on the break?  We're definitely not, but it just happens to work against us so well.

&gt;Everybody at our level or above has the goalscoring duos... Why is this a problem unique to us?

Because how many games have we won by margins greater than a single goal in the EPL this season?  Three, and one was a walkover against QPR.

We're not a functional attacking side.  All the teams around us are capable of winning by multiple goal margins even when they don't play that well (which is why Arsenal and Utd are above us, despite both having very average years).

We can't seem to manage it.  Even the 2-1 wins we manage to scrape together are less full of profligate dominance and are more full of barely-earned luck and the individual brilliance of Eriksen, Kane and Lloris.

It is, as you say, a lack of quality in our part.  I agree with that.  But whose fault is that?  It was largely Poch's decision not to buy any attackers, ostracise Adebayor, and shed handy squad players like Siggy, Holtby and Lennon.  He misjudged what we needed in terms of squad depth to make it through a busy new year schedule.

But does he seriously have a worse squad at his disposal now than he did at Southampton last year?  Or that Martinez had with Everton last year?

I honestly don't see how Poch has us playing any better than AVB did in his first season.  We were all celebrating AVB then, claiming he was just ironing out some bugs in a ""transitional"" season, and looking forward to his second term.  But instead what was happening was a persistent lack of creativity, a rigidity in tactics and formation despite neither particularly working for us, and a reliance on Bale's late goals.

I feel like the same thing is happening all over again.  I hate to say it, but unless Poch manages to reinvigorate his charges for the remainder of the campaign or start next season with a bang, I can easily see him being yet another victim of Levy's trigger finger mid-next season.",null,0,null,1425291888,null,0,false,0,cp1pf9b,null,t3_2xmeeo,null,t1_cp1pf9b,null,t1_cp1hgq6,null,null,null,1427533754,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

* Both the media and peoples desire to put a face to ISIS, and understand what it is and maybe more importantly why it seems to appeal to a certain demographic of young European muslims. 

* Individuals attempts to make sense of why an ostensibly ""British"" person, who at least for some part of their life appeared to be as ""western"" as any of us suddenly went off the rails so hard. Clearly several areas of thinking have emerged on this - ranging from radical clerics online and in British mosques, to radicalization through British university societies. 

* It perhaps viscerally demonstrates something I think most of us suspect to be true... that there is a gulf between what prominent Muslims are saying Islam ""is"" in public, and what they are saying to each other in private. A good example is this Asim Qureshi chap who runs CAGE... who sits there on TV claiming to be a defender of western civil liberties, whilst simultaneously in private encouraging other muslims to engage in Jihad. 

Anyway, it is irritating to hear about the same thing repeatedly... but these things happen.

Find out where your local discounter is (Aldi, Lidl, Farmfoods, Iceland). The cost of a bus fare will be recouped if you're shopping once or twice a week, or ideally arrange a car-share with friends where whoever drives gets petrol money.

&gt;You're not just advocating ripping off those who won't notice, you're doing so for those who it will actually make a difference.

No. I'm advocating *means* testing the state pension. That would only involve removing the state pension for those pensioners who don't need it. That is the *majority* of pensioners, and represents a significant saving.

&gt;Todays pensioners are not the government. But they did vote an arrangement between the government and themselves

Who could blame them? They voted for an arrangement that they would receive a generous state pension without having to pay for it. Who could blame them? It's free money after all.

The missiles would be at risk, but it would be a very tough situation and there's no way that all 120 would be intercepted.

The only assets capable of intercepting them are the Aster 15/30 missiles from the Type 45 destroyers, and the AIM-120Cs from the Typhoons.

Happy, educated, prosperous people tend not to wake up one morning and go ""Hey, I feel like bombing a school and murdering people at the market"". These issues do not exist in a vacuum. They are a result of societal pressures from parents / peers to follow a religion, poor life chances because they live in a middle eastern warzone thanks to politicians at home and abroad (Or in the case of these 3 girls, really poor social integration into British society), and the opportunity to be brave and strong and to fight for something 'noble' is attractive. They might just be pissed off with western foreign policy which is fair enough when put in context. 

When a person has very few opportunities to live a prosperous life what do you expect them to do? Curl up and die? Go to the market and earn a pittance? Or pick up a gun, live a wild life for a few years and maybe survive much richer?

&gt;If not, what is it about these 3 that makes them special?

They are still children (And women, and British, yes). One of them had to steal a passport and lie about her age to get out of the country. She knows what she's doing but I doubt she or her friends have any clue of the realities of what is going on over there.

If they were over 18 they'd just be another statistic.

&gt;What is it that makes them victims and the rest villains?

Age and life experience mainly. I'm not saying some 19 year old kid from Syria is any better off than they are either, he is a victim of circumstance too. He played no part in the collapse of his country's political system and is simply doing what he can to take control of his situation and hopefully survive.

This is news to you, despite happening for the past ten-to-fifteen years?

&gt;We had a minimum wage last time I looked.

Yes, we did and do. So what?

&gt;I`m amazed youve managed to quote me and still dodged the whole point of what I was saying.

Well of course you're amazed, you haven't actually replied to anything I've said yet and still appear to think this is all about *you*.

* I didn't say I was a victim, you did in order to cheapen my point.

* I wasn't talking about people working for less-than-minimum-wage, you brought that up yourself (again). Which says a bit about you and how you view immigrants.

I feel like moving him on the season BEFORE we move is incredibly risky, especially if we don't manage to hold on to Reid, Jenkinson and Song (even if Song appears to have forgotten how to play football). The upheaval in the team combined with a managerial change for what I can only assume would be some half-hearted attempt to woo another unknown former player from a smaller European club (á la Pochettino and Koeman) would be too much I think. Once we move, let's see what bargaining power we have for attracting top managers, but until then... I dunno.

I am not an Allardyce hater and have supported him through thick and thin, but now even I'm starting to get tired. West Brom and Palace were just enough to make me question his position for the first time. Even when we were in the relegation zone for much of 2013/14, and it was an *awful* season, I always had faith. Now I've seen how good we can be, Allardyce has made a rod for his own back. He's shown that with a bit of tweaking and confidence, we can beat anybody, but that *he* doesn't have the capacity to sustain that level of intensity. Which is a shame, because I though he had finally come good this year.

Although it's not a very progressive approach, and  one that not many will agree with, **for now** I'm happy in the knowledge that Allardyce has never been relegated. That's all I'll say.

Where would you place authoritarian schemes like ID Cards on the political spectrum? I mean it's an extreme right wing and an extreme left wing wet dream isn't it?

I agree that while the BBC does have a slight left-wing bias internally, it has a much stronger ""Say whatever the government of the day wants us to say"" vein running through it.

These girls weren't plucked from some war torn Libyan village and forced by circumstance to fight. They, if they come to be combatants, volunteered. As a result given that their war is not a legitimate action of self defence, any violence they perpetuate absolutely should be considered criminal.

I have never claimed to be an expert - I stated I wouldn't be surprised with the law if this were the case, but pointed out that our constitution and legal obligations are such a mess of history that I really doubt anyone could be confident if not a scholar on the topic.  You are the one who has claimed expertise, yet made claims contradicted by clear, widely publicised counterexamples

&gt;You haven't provided an example of one government binding another

Yes, I have.  UK law has been determined invalid, and the government has been successfully been sued on that basis simply for passing laws which violated those agreements.  The fact that we voluntarily accepted those bindings doesn't mean we're not bound.

&gt;No. I'm advocating means testing the state pension.

Yes.  Which is ripping off those who paid under the aggreement that they'd get a pension and then don't.  In the tescos example, it doesn't become OK when you refuse to give them the bread because you've determined they're rich enough to afford the loss of the money.

&gt;but they still remain free to leave the EU and no longer adhere to it's laws. 

That does not allow them to ignore the laws they are currently subject to.  They're still bound by them.  This is the paradox of power I mentioned in my post - it includes the ability to restrict your own actions too.

&gt;They voted for an arrangement that they would receive a generous state pension without having to pay for it.

No, they didn't.  The state pension dates back to 1908, though with major changes along the way ( with the [National Insurance Act of 1946](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance_Act_1946) being the introduction of compulsory NI funding the state pension.  Anyone of voting age at this time would now be over 87, which constitutes a minority of pensioners.  And even those likely *overpaid* for pensions, since they also paid for the pensions of those who had not, themselves, contributed a penny.  

They also expected they would not get out more than they put in.  That's down to the increase in life expectancy that wasn't expected at the time.  This was expected to be something that would pay for itself, and was designed on that basis.  Incorrectly, as it turned out, but that's the way things went.

&gt;You keep whinging that younger generations should feel morally obligated to honour a promise they never made

No, I'm saying the government should be obligated to honour a promise they **did** make, and that younger generations have no claim to absolve that institution of past debts and obligations, any more than they can do so for the national debt, or all the other things money was spent on in the past.  We are not the government, we have a say in how it's run, but if the government as an institution can't be trusted to keep its obligations, that's a *disaster* for everyone - long term agreements become impossible.

So you're not refuting my fact that the BBC did run an story which uncritically allowed someone with obvious and significant financial interests in military hardware production to go on TV and talk up war with Russia. Firstly, how is that news? Secondly, isn't that a conflict of interest which should have been declared? Thirdly, as a taxpayer doesn't the lack of journalistic integrity of the BBC News's staff bother you?

I don't necessarily work for your insurance company, so I can't necessarily say how your insurance company will handle this, but I am reasonably certain what I'm about to tell you would generally be true.

From looking at your gif, you've had what we'd call a ""narrow road collision"".  That's any accident where there is no central line down the middle of the road.  Strictly speaking on a narrow road there's no ""sides"" so to speak.  In a practical sense there is, of course, but because narrow roads have varying widths and so do cars, it is difficult in narrow road collisions to establish that an individual driver was negligent because of their road position.  

If you claimed on your insurance, and your insurance got the footage and traced the other car's reg, they'd show the footage to the other insurance company, who would turn right around and say that their driver was exercising caution by not getting too close to the edge of the road (which is dangerous because striking the edge could cause a larger accident as it might cause their client to lose control).  The other driver does come out a little, but it's not like he's fully on the other side of the road, so they'd argue that their driver was not particularly negligent in that sense.  Also, the footage shows you are still in motion at the time.  The other insurance company would argue that you are both at fault, for travelling around a blind bend at such speed that neither of you could safely stop in time to prevent a collision.

Whether you and your insurance company agrees with that or not, if that's the position of the other side, your insurance company would have a hard time changing the other insurance company's mind, and they'd then have to weigh up either taking the case to court (where they might lose and have to pay thousands in court fees if the judge agrees with the other side), or accepting a 50/50 settlement, with both drivers being held at fault.  I'm afraid alomost every insurance company is going to do the latter, many of them will think it through like this and won't even bother pursuing the other insurance company, because it's probably better to just pay your claim and take no action to invite a claim from the other driver, unless you really push them.

So if you go to your insurance company, there's basically two possibilities:
1) Your insurance company pursues it, you get back half the cost of the mirror and it counts as a claim on the policy, or 2) Your insurance company doesn't pursue, you pay the cost of the mirror yourself if it's less than the excess, and depending on your insurer it may or may not affect your insurance.

Short version is it sucks man, and you have my sympathies.

EDIT: I should also mention that depending on your insurance agreement, you may or may not be required to tell your insurance company about this, make sure you check your documents in that regard, if you don't tell them and they find out at a later date (ususally because you forgot to not mention it), your insurance company could bump up your insurance retroactively, or even refuse to pay all or a portion of your claim if they find out during a later claim.",null,0,null,1425299163,null,0,1425299714,0,cp1qxej,null,t3_2xnheu,null,t1_cp1qxej,null,t3_2xnheu,null,null,null,1427534456,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

We can be confident of it. Because the concept of parliamentary sovereignty is the central tenet of the British constitution and is probably the very first thing you learn studying law. 

You haven't provided counter-examples to parliamentary sovereignty. What you provided was an example of the UK government holding itself to EU law.

I don't care if you think it's ripping pensioners off. I think pensioners demanding cash handouts they haven't paid for from younger taxpayers is ripping society off.

This law is just about determining an approriate limit beyond which driving ability is impaired. If your driving ability is impaired you shouldn't be driving FFS. Exactly the same as alcohol - and does anyone still think driving over the limit is still OK?

All the arguments against are the same old arguments we used to get from habitual drunk drivers: 'I can drive better after 6 pints as most people drive normally', 'if you can't drive after a few beers you shouldn't be on the road at all', and one that's already in this thread a few times: 'I did it and I didn't feel impaired at all'. Of course you didn't, it affects your judgement and perception. All drunk drivers think their driving is fine.

Driving a vehicle is a big responsibility and lives are wrecked or ended when people get it wrong. Drink driving stopped being socially acceptable decades ago. This is no different. 

If you can argue why you should be allowed to drive while you're over a limit on substances that affect your ability, I'm all ears.

'Why be empathetic with such a person?'


Well, never forget how gruesome humans can be if they experience specific things, are victims of specific social problems or hold on to their belief because they cannot live with the painful reality. By not being empathetic you do exactly this. You accept that 'Jihadi John' is a sick, stupid psychopath that just loves to be violent and rebellious, rape children, whatever --&gt; 'Only a monster could do this. Someone shoot him so he gets what he deserves, just like the other monster terrorists.'

Emwazi is a human. He may have been kind and gentle. He may have somehow saved lives of suicidal friends or helped people in need in his life. He was playing with other children in his childhood, went to school etc. just like most of us.

It can be me, you, your best friend, your brother or your mailman. People who take another path like he did are neither stupid, retarded, psychopathic nor anything of this kind.
Every memory, every idea and every thought leads you. 

You can on one day be a frustrated artist, rejected by his own people (or more or less the university you applied to) and a few years later you command the obliteration of jews, gays, mentally ill, slavs etc.


In the end we're simple humans.


If we as a society forget about empathy and let our judgment be affected by dehumanisation, we will fail to see the causes of our problems, will always fight with them and miss to voice our concerns with possible stupid ideas our leaders have.

Easy example: training and arming insurgents it will backfire (roughly speaking) --&gt; Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 80s, ISIS now

I am happy that we have reached the point where many know that this does not work and only creates instability and extremism. 
But it doesn't need more than a few articles, a few speeches from politicians and videos showing beheadings that we start to thirst for blood and forget every bit of empathy and reason and are able to sign off and tolerate the death of hundreds of thousands of innocents for the sake of our safety --&gt; from the extremists, we created by messing around with their politics.

Look I'm no big fan of aggressive law enforcement tactics and I've been to many a rave in my lifetime. But come on....please. Reasons why this event was considered ""illegal"": No insurance policy covering members of the public, no controls over alcohol being sold to minors, no safety regulations (What happens when a speaker stack collapses and crushes someone?) such as electrical safety, rig safety and no properly insured security or crowd control. Add to the fact in some cases these things are held on private land against the owner's wishes, with the owner having to foot the bill for any clean up afterwards. You can see why the law would take issue with this. It's all well and good when these things go off without a hitch, which they invariably do most of the time, but when that one 15 year old overdoses, or someone is raped, or someone is stabbed or they fall into a hole or any number of situations then who's responsible? What does it lead to? A big court case, potential jail for the organisers if they're caught and a massive headache for the legal system which would have been prevented if the proper regulations and permissions were granted.

We all decry health and safety measures as excessive but I challenge you to present me a world that's safer for not having most of them. Even organised and legal raves can have massive safety issues, but at least someone is culpable if something goes wrong. 

You sound like an idealistic kid who hasn't thought through any of what you've said. The issues of an armoured or armed police force and their tactics are completely separate from stopping a bunch of people organising a huge gathering of people without any safeguards for the crowd at large, not being covered for any potential damages and having no risk assessments whatsoever. And to equate it all with some misplaced notion of Orwellian control is both obtuse and frankly stupid, which is why you're earning the dreaded downvotes (I didn't add to them, by the way).

No, only by banning the mentioning of it negatively in the media, whilst simultaneously and disproportionately increasing the coverage of anyone who's gay, to give people the false impression that there are more gay people than there actually are. Essentially glorifying someone('s achievements) solely because they are gay. See 

- Tom Daley. 
- the recent moneysupermarket advert
- the media hanging on every word of Ian McKellan (wouldn't happen if he was straight)
- posters on the tube depicting 'gay role models' such as Judy Garland. i.e. cherry picking the dead and famous (and in this case NOT gay) and riding on their fame to promote one's own ideology. It helps that the dead can't complain.

&gt;but by changing people's minds.

You mean by fostering a fearful atmosphere where people are peer pressured (artificially, by the media) into openly supporting gay rights for fear that not doing so would have them branded as ""homophobic"". Almost like a witch hunt.

The gay rights movement has been nothing but emotional manipulation, brainwashing. No minds have been changed. People are simply afraid to speak their minds. 

Homosexuality is a broken attraction mechanism. An illness. There, I said it. Now downvote me for expressing a valid view (or rather, fact) held by both commoners and scientists throughout the ages.

Am I mistaken in thinking they *do* pay tax on the proportion of their wages that they earn here?

Let's say I get a job with HSBC, and I agree with them that I'll move to Hong Kong and be employed by their HK office, work there for 2 months before being transferred back to the UK… that allows me to claim I'm domicile in HK and on secondment here. 

If they pay me £500,000 per year, and I bring £200,000 per year into the UK to spend on food, rent an au pair and so on, don't I have to pay tax on the £200,000?

I hate to seem on the side of the tax dodgers, but it appears to me like many of these people are  rich enough to just use a ""management company"" in Antigua or Panama if we took away their non-dom status.

They'd have the bank employ Synax Error Consulting, and then Joe Syntax would be employed by the consulting company, and they'd bank the difference untaxed offshore that way.

If I'm interpreting this right, removing non-dom status would just be sticking a band-aid on a symptom of globalised neoliberalism.

[Here's an article written about this by Glenn Greenwald recently.](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/26/fbi-manufacture-plots-terrorism-isis-grave-threats/)


A US judge actually commented on one of these cases, [involving a man called James Cromitie](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/12/newburgh-four-fbi-entrapment-terror), stating;

&gt;""Only the government could have made a terrorist out of Mr Cromitie, a man whose buffoonery is positively Shakespearean in its scope,"" she said in court. She added: ""I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that there would have been no crime here except the government instigated it, planned it and brought it to fruition.""

-Judge Colleen McMahon

I really would not surprised if this is happening often in the UK too, after all, Snowden's leaked proved our government agencies (GCHQ) are doing far more intrusive things than American agencies, so I wouldn't be surprised if we're doing these entrapment stunts too. 

If we are doing this, it wouldn't be remotely surprising if one of these informants/assets/entrapped people, actually turned on the government agency and followed through with the attack that the government set them up and funded them for, all they'd need to do is flee the country before the government swept in to arrest them (which is their plan all along).

This is of course conjecture, I'm not saying it's definitely happened here, just that it's a possibility that shouldn't be dismissed as a conspiracy theory, after all, it's happening in America, and we're their bitch.

We can?  I've pointed out clear cases where we *can* be sued simply for passing laws that are in violation of our other agreements.  You're claiming that you know for a fact that there are exactly **zero** such laws or agreements that render the government subject to being sued in similar ways, despite the widespread agreements we have relating to money between nations that we are signatories of?  Sorry, I'm still in the ""doubt it"" camp.

&gt;You haven't provided counter-examples to parliamentary sovereignty

Because the point I objected to was ""Bound by other nations decisions"", which I did provide counter-examples for.  Indeed, I pointed out that absolute sovereignity was not even a barrier to this, and indeed, even *neccessitates* it.

&gt;I think pensioners demanding cash handouts they haven't paid for 

And I don't think the government (or any other institution) should take money on the basis that they would provide something and then not provide it.  At minimum, that money should be returned - you seemed to say you were fine with this, though I'd note that it probably involves giving the wealthier segment many times what their pensions would cost, and unless you draw the line *really* low (and likely even then), is going to amount to a net loss (the wealthier are really the only ones who have contributed more than they will take out, so you'll likely make things worse - paying the rich more than they would otherwise get, while those who need it more get less).

&gt;Well it isn't. Not legally. Nor morally. 

I have doubts about the former, and disagree with the latter, and I'd add one even more important one: pragmatically.  Reneging on agreements will make things worse for everyone.  Governments are built on trust - a government that goes around seizing property by fiat is not to find many people willing to invest in that country.  A government which has made it clear is not going to abide by being bound by its past commitments is going to face the same issue.

Actually you haven't presented a single case that called into question the concept of parliamentary sovereignty. Which case are you referring to? 

&gt;You're claiming that you know for a fact that there are exactly zero such laws or agreements that render the government subject to being sued in similar ways,

About being sued for removing the state pension? Yes there are zero laws that would enable someone to sue the government for pursuing that policy. Feel free to try and find one though.

Now you're just making things up. I never mentioned other nation's decisions. It wasn't a point I made.

&gt;At minimum, that money should be returned - you seemed to say you were fine with this, though I'd note that it probably involves giving the wealthier segment many times what their pensions would cost, and unless you draw the line really low (and likely even then), is going to amount to a net loss (the wealthier are really the only ones who have contributed more than they will take out, so you'll likely make things worse - paying the rich more than they would otherwise get, while those who need it more get less).

What I would be fine with is calculating the total national insurance contributions of pensioners, poling that money and then dividing it between those in genuine need. Let's call it a means-tested state pension.

What I am not ok with is cutting state benefits to people in genuine need, so that instead you can give cash handouts to wealth pensioners.

null,false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"This does look very promising, though for the sake of fairness I will point out that the first lagoon wants £168/MWh and the second £90/MWh. I saw an awful lot of complaining about £92/MWh from Hinkley C back when that was in the news, but no one's complaining about this now.

On Capital Cost it looks appealing, too: £1Bn for 320MW compared to £24Bn (ish) for 3,200MW at Hinkley.

The only downside is the 14 hours of generation at the high and low tide marks, which happen 4 times a day meaning 3.5 hours per tidal event. This suggests rough generation time periods of 3am-7am,9am-2pm, 3pm-7pm and 10pm-2am. Bear in mind these time slots will very much contract depending on what the lagoon is asked to provide: if National Grid only want 100MW the ""fuel"" (ie, water rising and falling with tide) will deplete more slowly, while if the Grid wants all 320MW the lagoon's going to empty out much faster. Their 14 hours a day claim will be assuming a generation average of X MW, but I don't know what X is.

Edit: To clarify after three comments in a row I used today's tidal table to get those figures. There'll be times when the tides match up well but the Lagoon will only operate at it's best during the evening peak, with viable operations in the afternoon and near-useless operations in late evening and overnight. There'll be significant periods of time where the lagoon *can* technically generate but will find it difficult or financially unviable to do so.

Peak demand is around 5pm-8pm every day, which the lagoon matches poorly. Lowest demand is overnight, between around 11pm and 7am, which covers fully half the lagoon's operating timeframes.

The afternoon slot is a time of rising demand, which is good for the lagoon, and the evening slot is a time of relatively stable, but high, demand, which will probably be good for the lagoon.

So while the lagoon *can* generate 14 hours a day across 4 time slots, only 2 of those time slots really match the conditions it will want to generate under. The overnight trough will see it competing with very low-cost baseload stations that National Grid will be unwilling to turn off or down in favour of the lagoon, due to the ramping costs incurred.

Overall I say the lagoon is a good thing, though. It actually takes a good shot at overcoming two of the three major problems with renewables: poor predictability and inflexibility. Like pumped storage, this lagoon will be very, very predictable. It will also be very flexible, but only within its time frames. It will, sadly, remain intermittent, being useful only for set periods of the day. 

It will be a good addition to our energy mix, as value for money is certainly there, as it's cheaper per MW on the nameplate than other mediums of generation and with the 120-year lifespan will surely pay itself off.

I'm not having a go at public services at all I just don't see the value of the BBC as being the same as the NHS or the education system. The BBC isn't an essential service at all and it certainly isn't one that should be paid for by people regardless of usage. 

I don't think the BBC is something I'm comfortable paying for in the same fashion because it's not like I'm helping people who need it or paying for a time when I myself might need it. The BBC doesn't fulfill any needs, it's cultural importance is obviously debatable but it's ridiculous to force people who don't use an entirely non essential service to pay for it.

Basically if the BBC is as important to the nation as many in this thread are making out then if they did move to a subscription model then plenty people would happily go for it but I think it's fair to say that those people are living in a fantasy world because as soon as it becomes optional people will ignore it because most people in the country couldn't give two shits about the BBC and likely wouldn't pay the TV license price for a subscription to the BBC services.",null,0,null,1425303925,null,0,false,0,cp1sbn3,null,t3_2xngp5,null,t1_cp1sbn3,null,t1_cp1s674,null,null,null,1427535174,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

|All the arguments against are the same old arguments we used to get from habitual drunk drivers: 'I can drive better after 6 pints as most people drive normally', 'if you can't drive after a few beers you shouldn't be on the road at all', and one that's already in this thread a few times: 'I did it and I didn't feel impaired at all'. Of course you didn't, it affects your judgement and perception. All drunk drivers think their driving is fine.

No, this is not the argument. The issue is that the limit for cannabis is so low that if you had smoked a joint in the evening after work, you're going to show up as OTL when you are driving to work the next day. 

I am going to assume you've never smoked weed and say at the most the effects last 3-4 hours, less if you're a regular smoker. So what you are saying about people being impaired is simply not true. I have never felt impaired the day after smoking, unlike with alcohol. 

Obviously only an idiot drives around stoned and I am not advocating that. What I am saying is this law needlessly punishes cannabis users who smoke responsibly. The limit should be raised from the shockingly low 2 ug.l to the limit in Colorado is 5 ug/l.

That being said. Where's your life insurance, health insurance, so on and so forth? Why do we not cover our own asses and rely on the government so heavily?

We've all heard the government fuck up and sanction people that shouldn't be sanctioned, but generally you are sanctioned for the following reasons:

* Turning up late to your DWP meeting - This is justified, if I turned up late for work consistently i too would get into trouble.

* Not attending interviews - This is justified, the DWP has one focus in mind. Getting you into work, whether you want to take that job or not is not their problem. If you meet the skill criteria for that job and you turn it down because its toilet cleaning... Then you're turning down work and if you're not in that desperate a need for work, then surely you don't need the DWPs help.

* Not going to training programmes/work experience - This seems contentious, but there's a reason for these training programmes. If you have zero skills available and zero work experience, this will help you a fuck load, turning down (as lefties like to call it) ""Slave labour"" because its beneath you or you don't feel it helps should result in santions. 

My fiancee worked as a nurse for SIX MONTHS unpaid,  she did it to gain experience and make contacts in her chosen profession. She wasn't on the dole and worked part time during this period.

* Having excuses for not turning up to DWP interviews. Hey man, its all legal, if you legitimately have a reason for not turning up. Prove it... quite simple really... You were ill? Doctors note (most professions require this). You had a bereavement? prove it, you were late for your bus? Too bad, get an earlier one next time. I'm sorry but I feel no pain towards someone moaning about being late to their meeting and getting sanctioned as a result... If two weeks worth of food relied on me going to my local DWP at 9am. I would make -the fuck- sure to be at that interview. real real simple...

There are actually dozens...

&gt; but that doesn't cost anywhere near what the license fee costs.

That's because you're now hinging the fee on a single service. If it seems unlikely that it would be that simple, it's probably because it's not.

&gt;I can't forsee a situation where I am desperately in need of BBC entertainment programming because I've run out of things to watch...

Good job their programming is for everyone and not just you then, eh? Or are you yet another redditor who has only *ever* watched Sherlock on repeat based on what is really a loophole so that you can pretend that your non-funding makes no difference?

&gt;The private sector exists and can and does do most of what the BBC does in terms of ""entertainment"".

Sure. Sky's original (not cross-funded) content like Footballer's Wives is just fantastic. Their radio stations are, er, fantastic. Their news service is in a class of its' own (""Hey, a dead passengers' suitcase! Let's have  a look""). Their kids' channels have, er, no adverts and neither do their associated websites. Their Open University stuff is unequalled (if it even exists). And that's just Sky - Virgin buy in *everything*.

I'm sorry i haven't got the time to list out the thousands of non essential services that you pay for (assuming you pay tax) that you get no use of (which in fact you actually do get use of afterall). The BBC is simply far more visible due to its nature and its funding model.

It's a start.

&gt;well going by my personal experience kids don't watch TV any more. 

So, that'll be relatively none at all, then. I've got two, but I don't then take that as a yardstick for every kid in the UK.

&gt;but my son doesn't watch tv anywhere he watches people on youtube and cartoons on netflix, adverts to him are almost alien anyway.

So....as long as you provide the rest of the country's kids with Netflix subs, there's no problem.

&gt;Which websites are we talking about here because there's a very different conversation to be had depending on which ones.

Any compared to the CBeebies site, would be a start. Which, of course, you'll have kept your son visiting in preference to others for as long as possible so that he doesn't get ideas about what toys he 'deserves', right?

&gt;The services provides vareity?

This isn't really even questionable for the BBC - the fact that you're still asking it is significant.

&gt;More so than the internet or sky?

More than Sky. Can't really say with 'the internet'.

&gt;Rubbish a great deal of what's on the BBC is lowest common denominator pish

e.g. stuff that you don't like. I don't like Songs of Praise, but I recognise that other people do.

&gt;well I'm fairly sure if enough people were watching them a commericail or subscription based version of the BBC would provide it.

After how long, exactly? Sky has been around for how many decades, now?

Of course you didn't, it affects your judgement and perception. All drunk drivers think their driving is fine.

This is not the argument that people are using. Of course people are impaired when they are high, but as many others have said cannabis metabolites stay in the body for weeks and yet the high lasts around 6 hours at most. Imagine if you had a pint on Sunday and on Friday a test said you were over the alcohol limit, this is what people are rightly concerned about. There is nothing impairing you a day later let alone a week, yet you're still over the 'metabolite limit'.

Also, without fuelling your mindset on people saying 'driving high' is ""okay"" too much (because it's not), all 'highs' are not made equal. I would argue that whilst - yes, you ARE impaired whilst high - the impairment is **very** different from alcohol.

In general, weed makes you drive slower by overestimating speed and hazards, and be overly cautious. This is still more dangerous than driving sober, but I would argue less dangerous than driving drunk, where you tend to underestimate speed and hazards. If I had the unfortunate choice of being in a car with a drunk vs stoned driver, I would without fail always pick the stoned driver, despite both being more risky for all concerned. Drunk driving is *vastly* more dangerous than stoned driving, though stoned driving is still dangerous.

I would actually say that caffeine also increases the risk of dangerous driving too, as personally I tend to be more impatient and drive faster after a bout of strong coffees.

&gt;I am biased against propaganda and poor reporting

I don't like it, but I'm not going to go on a rant about how the BBC is some sort of propaganda machine. That's so laughable. Who the fuck are they meant to be siding with here? Because so many people claim them to be lefty-propaganda, but you seem hell-bent on implying they are in bed with arms manufacturers, very much NOT left wing. It's funny, isn't it, how some people think it is too left wing and some people think it is too right wing. Maybe you just aren't as central as you think you are.

&gt;So you're not refuting my fact that the BBC did run an story which uncritically allowed someone with obvious and significant financial interests in military hardware production to go on TV and talk up war with Russia

I don't actually know about the incident in question so feel free to show me it and until then I won't pass comment

&gt;Firstly, how is that news?

How is the current situation with Russia news? Seriously? Come on...

&gt;Secondly, isn't that a conflict of interest which should have been declared?

Where exactly is the conflict of interests? Again, please show me this so I can pass judgement

&gt;Thirdly, as a taxpayer doesn't the lack of journalistic integrity of the BBC News's staff bother you?

Not at all because BBC News is generally a very well respected News organisation that does a very good job of factual reporting and fact checking, making sure they can get as much source material behind what they report as possible. I think they do a very good job of it so the very tiny amount of my taxes that go to them are spent well

&gt;I don't think jocularly calling someone who is a known murderer 'Jihadi John' is particularly conducive to effective news reporting.

It's what people know him as, so why not? I get it could put him in a more positive light, or bring to light his actions not as the barbaric acts they are, but for a long time his name wasn't known to the public or media and now Jihadi John has stuck. It wasn't the BBC that created the name and it wasn't them who kept perpetuating it. Everyone did. You can't stick them with all the blame. I have no real strong feelings about what name you give to people, they're just names

I really really love the general style we have played with since Bobby took over. However, we aren't Barcelona. There's no Messi to bail us out if we need it. We need a plan B, or just a complete overhaul. What he is doing now is obviously not working. The talent is there to play two wingers. Its inexcusable to play Naismith or Barkley on the left when we have 3 very talented left sided players in the squad. Having no left winger has not only taken away any width but has left Baines overexposed on the left.

Perhaps because that wasn't the question?  You asked:

&gt;&gt;You haven't provided an example of one government binding another

IE. the thing I **did** provide an example for?  I gave an example of the thing I disputed, and that you asked for.

&gt;Yes there are zero laws that would enable someone to sue the government for pursuing that policy

Like I said, I'm *far* from confident, given your track record here.  You really expect me to believe that you've pored over every international treaty, trade agreement, EU agreement and law and found that there are exactly none that would give someone grounds to sue the government due to failing to meet such a stated agreement?

&gt;poling that money and then dividing it between those in genuine need

Ie. reneging on your agreements, and not even compensating them with the money it took from them on false pretences.  Why is it only taxpaying workers that should be singled out for this confiscation of benefits.  Why wouldn't a more general taxation of the rich be a better idea, rather than penalising only those who actually contributed to the upkeep of the system in this way?

&gt;What I am not ok with is cutting state benefits to people in genuine need, so that instead you can give cash handouts to wealth pensioners.

Yeah, and let's ignore the national debt - why are we paying money to wealthy corporations who bought bonds, rather than those in need.  And let's borrow a bunch of money from someone wealthy, and then not pay it back because they don't need it.  Why didn't anyone else think of this - you're a genius, the financial crisis will be over in no time!  There are perfectly sound practical, moral and (I still think likely legal) reasons for governments not to renege on financial agreements.  No one is going to trust a government that considers itself free to ignore past commitments just because it needs the money.

&gt;I don't care if they voted in a government who promised them free money. 

And again, they didn't.  Like I said, the pension scheme was around for longer than most of them were able to vote, and the money certainly wasn't free - they've paid a lifetime of contributions that you're now advocating we don't even return.",null,0,null,1425306297,null,0,false,0,cp1t80a,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp1t80a,null,t1_cp1s61y,null,null,null,1427535594,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Who mentioned consistency? Turn up late ONCE and you're sanctioned. Why not tell me about that once you got stuck in traffic, or just, for no real reason, ended up running late because things just kept getting in the way. You're happy for that one freak occasion to lead to the withdrawal of your wages for that week, or to get a written warning because you needed the loo just before a meeting started? OK, that's alright then, we'll let that one slide.

&gt; Not attending interviews - This is justified

Care to comment on the people who've said they've been sanctioned for attending job interviews, telling the Jobcentre about them well in advance, getting verbal agreements from the staff, then finding out they've been sanctioned when their money doesn't turn up?

&gt; Not going to training programmes/work experience.

The JCP will go to great lengths to tell you that the courses are mandatory and a no-show will result in a sanction. So let's go back to the first point and discuss what counts as a no-show, and let's mention illness, family crises, inability to pay for childcare, inability to pay for travel...

&gt; You were ill? Doctors note (most professions require this)

Not for the first 7 days. It's called self-certification and it's pretty much global. In the case of flu, you're actively encouraged **not to visit your GP**, keeping your germs at home and self-medicating as instructed. If your fiancee is a nurse, you should damn well know that.

Out of interest, how many mouths does your fiancee have to feed? Did she earn enough from her second, paying job to feed an average family of four, pay rent, council tax, cover childcare, travel, medical bills? That must have been an amazingly well paid part time job she had, there.

&gt; I'm sorry but I feel no pain towards someone moaning about being late to their meeting and getting sanctioned as a result

So the next time you're late to a meeting at work and they dock a week's pay, or three months' pay, that's fine by you and only fair, is it?

The next time you're waiting at least 45 minutes for the other people in a meeting to turn up after you've get there on time, but instead of them being docked a week's or three months wages for being late, they warn you that you'll lose money if you're late, that's fine, too is it?

OK, well in that case, I'm sorry for wasting your time. Every single instance of bad treatment and unfair sanctions is completely the filthy chav scum workshy waster's fault, then.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;There tends to be little real effort at integration on either side and the people in charge do little to help.

The host nation has the capacity and resources to help people integrate into the main society. People argue against placement housing but the main issue with integration is the local social hegemony that people experience. Placing an immigrant into an area which is predominantly established British is going to expose them to the norms of that culture. Placing an immigrant into an area which is full of new immigrants from all over the world is going to be difficult to navigate, so they will gravitate towards things they are familiar with. People *need* a strong social hegemony to feel comfortable and to feel like they belong to their society. Religions, Football clubs and all those kind of social activities fill in the gaps for people trying to fit in. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' basically.

&gt;Also, could we not argue that these problems with integration can be attributed to the peoples social class just as much as their nationality or ethnicity? I'd like to think it's not differences that cause friction, but inequality. Maybe nationality or ethnicity are part of the problem, but I've always thought it naive to call it the whole problem.

Social and economic class matters. Nationality (the languages you speak) and to a lesser degree your ethnicity do matter. Your cultural norms will not necessarily fit with your new host nation and that can and does cause friction between communities.  If you can't communicate very well with those around you that can be isolating and frustrating for both parties. Not having enough money to join in with 'normal' social activities is also isolating. All of these things are surmountable with a bit of effort on behalf of the recipient country. These people are good enough to open the border for and invite in - why wouldn't we want them to feel welcome and part of the society? It seems like the social contract should extend a bit further than ""Fine, you're in, now sit down and shut up"".

I've always found it bizarre that we want people to come to Britain but then make no effort what so ever to help them to feel like they actually belong here. You don't invite people to a party then ignore them do you? Britain's immigration policy basically amounts to a rude party host and we can do a lot better. We must do better if we want to avoid more problems like this.",null,0,null,1425307208,null,0,1425308342,0,cp1tlui,null,t3_2xne83,null,t1_cp1tlui,null,t1_cp1sgfq,null,null,null,1427535773,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;Considering it's about half the cost of the license fee they can easily do it themselves.

So....you can now illustrate how Netflix will provide OU content for them, safe, non-profit websites for them, and the like? Or do you want to *really* go mad and deal with the ramifications of why I'd have pointed out the cost of having to sub every child in the country?

&gt;I don't even understand what you're trying to say here.

Find a paid-TV-subscription channel that doesn't have adverts, is actually designed to stop kids accidentally browsing elsewhere, has no product tie-ins that *isn't* CBeebies. There must be loads, right?

Then I highlight how, as a parent letting their child/ children browse the web, many will sing the praises of CBeebies as there's simply nothing else like it. All the show have their own webpages, again with no adverts, no links to elsewhere etc. (Go to CartoonNetworks webiste and watch what happens).

The telling part is how you've got offspring, you let them on youtube and Netflix but still have no idea what I'm talking about - which is significant when you're defending a completely commercial offering as a perfectly acceptable option (with no other alternative).

So find an example then. When has a UK citizen sued the UK government following the removal of benefits.

Should be easy for you to find if you're so confident.

You're obviously keen to raise taxes. If it makes you feel any better let's institute a tax on income from state pensions. Above a certain income wealth threshold - say anybody who doesn't need a state pension - tax their state pension at 100% and redistribute the money to the genuinely needy.

&gt;No one is going to trust a government that considers itself free to ignore past commitments just because it needs the money.

I doubt there'll be a credit implication of making the state pension means tested rather than universal. 

&gt;And again, they didn't. Like I said, the pension scheme was around for longer than most of them were able to vote, and the money certainly wasn't free - they've paid a lifetime of contributions that you're now advocating we don't even return.

It most certainly is free money. Pensioners ""lifetime of contributions"" doesn't come close to covering the cost of the state pension. It's free money we're handing out. Financed by the taxpayer.

I hope someone manages to raise that limit slightly.  It seems far too low.  But as others have mentioned, this could be good as a step forward to legalising since t here's now a law in place to deal with drugs and the limits you can have while driving.

https://www.reddit.com/r/uktrees/comments/2xjsev/this_new_uk_drug_driving_law/cp0rxpp

&gt; So here's a kicker, I actually work in road safety. I run one of the largest road safety campaigns in the UK - but it relates to speeding not drug driving.
&gt; 
&gt; This law, is one of the worst laws I've ever come across and I have some serious doubt about how ethical or correct this piece of legislation is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Facts**
&gt; 
&gt; * The limit for cannabis is 2µg/L, which means pretty much nothing. It's interesting to note that the law remains focussed on blood content, these new devices which test your sobriety at the roadside cannot be used for prosectution
&gt; * The devices are a replacement for the roadside sobriety test (touch your nose, say the alphabet backwards) because that test is stupid and no police ever want to carry it out. 
&gt; * If you're asked to use a device and you're seen as over the limit, you must go back to the station to draw a blood sample. If you're over 2µg/L things start to get difficult (bad times).
&gt; * If you do not consent to using the device they will probably take you back to the station to do a forced blood test
&gt; 
&gt; * You could have 2µg/L up to 24 hours after a joint, if you're an every day smoker like me, you'll likely be over the limit for 3-4 days after smoking due to the build up of delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol in your system (anyone saying a month is a moron).
&gt; * If you smoke high CDB low THC, this could be enough to fool the test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Issues**
&gt; 
&gt; From the point of view of some prude in whitehall, this law makes sense.. find a way to detect drug driving and punish those people for using an illegal drug. The people in whitehall would not consider the fact there are sensible drug users our there, nor do they care that other countries are legalising.
&gt; 
&gt; The police are frustrated, because despite the fact most people on /r/uktrees are sensible and attempt to abide by road safety laws, there are an awful lot of people who smoke and drive. As mentioned I work in road safety, if we spend a day stopping speeding drivers, 10% of them will be stoned as hell. As a stoner myself this is incredibly annoying as it's something I would NEVER do.
&gt; 
&gt; The people who do smoke and drive, don't care - they see it as 'illegal' anyway. They have already considered the risks and if they're happy to get into a car whilst carrying cannabis, they sure as hell don't care about road safety. This is where the system fails the most.
&gt; 
&gt; **Missed Opportunity**
&gt; 
&gt; There's a real missed opportunity here, local governments are very forward thinking about road safety, if they weren't I'd be out of a job. For the most part, local government understand that engaging with drivers and working in partnership for safer roads is much more successful than controlling road users with fear of prosecution.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for the change in law on March 2nd is to do with the introduction of these devices (which the police have been talking/testing for nearly ten years). These devices could have brought a fantastic opportunity.
&gt; 
&gt; **How to actually make the roads safe**
&gt; 
&gt; The police should be trying to educate cannabis users on the dangers and prevention of drug-driving. This would involve:
&gt; 
&gt; * Treating cannabis users the same as alcohol users when behind the wheel... if they're carrying cannabis then fine - throw the book at them, you have to be pretty stupid to get in a car with cannabis.
&gt; 
&gt; * Setting understandable limits - the govt learned this lesson already with 'alcohol units' - confusing systems of metrics don't work, by setting the legal limit to 2uG/L of blood, they're basically saying ""There's a limit, we can test you but you'll never know.
&gt; 
&gt; **The most important bit**
&gt; 
&gt; * The devices should be re-usable and purchasable with a reasonable detection time window (detects cannabis for 6-8 hours), that way, sensible cannabis users could test themselves BEFORE getting into the car and putting anyone at risk.
&gt; 
&gt; * The public sale of these devices could be taxed to offset the cost of purchasing for the police, that way - drug users will be paying a financial burden for the luxury of using drugs rather than facing legal prosecution.
&gt; 
&gt; * Any corrupt politicians who are pushing this legislastion because they have financial interests in the manufacturing or sale of these devices will be happy because they will see more dividends.
&gt; 
&gt; **What next**
&gt; 
&gt; It's difficult, the police have wanted these devices for a long time. The drug-driving laws are here to stay and they can't be stopped, but what we could achieve is changing the drug driving laws so they're more sensible and aimed at reducing harm rather than punishing drug users.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I had some masterplan for how we could try and fix this situation, but I don't work FOR the police I just work WITH them. I'm seeing my police contact next week so I'll be trying to get more information but to be perfectly honest my role doesn't include drug-driving and I certainly don't want him testing a device out on me.
&gt; 
&gt; **FOR NOW - PLAY IT SAFE, ALWAYS WAIT 4-6 HOURS BEFORE DRIVING AFTER A JOINT, KEEP YOURSELF HYDRATED, TAKE EYE DROPS IF NEEDED. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T STINK OF WEED - THESE DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE AND THE POLICE WILL ONLY USE THEM IF THEY SUSPECT YOU MAY BE HIGH. AVOID ANY ROADS WHICH THE POLICE HAVE SET UP A STOPPING AREA - THIS MAY BE FOR TRAINING ON THE DEVICE**
&gt;

Lots/ most people don't have cable or Sky. You're reducing TV output to be optional because it's optional *for you*. Why don't more people push private medicine in this way? I m

&gt; But were it down to me, I wouldn't pay it and just buy what I wanted to watch off amazon, because you know the BBC does put Top Gear on amazon for you to buy by the episode, all legal and above board.

And if such things were down to a lot of people, they wouldn't pay for services they don't see themselves as ever using - which is (fortunately) not how the TV license works. I'm happy to pay for something that benefits everyone even if they never use it - the fact that Sky have to buy in (or at best, co-fund) anything they show of any worth and haven't changed this approach for decades speaks for itself.

&gt;You're not going to convince me to pay for other peoples entertainment.

I don't have to - the burden of proof isn't on me, it's on you to give examples of how it would benefit *everyone*, and using your own viewing habits as justification is no different from insisting that you've never needed the fire service.

Why not tell me about that once you got stuck in traffic, or just, for no real reason, ended up running late because things just kept getting in the way. You're happy for that one freak occasion to lead to the withdrawal of your wages for that week, or to get a written warning because you needed the loo just before a meeting started? OK, that's alright then, we'll let that one slide.

Its about building trust. In my job I'm trusted that what I'm saying is true. IF, however there wasn't that level of trust, and i desperately needed my job, I'd make sure that I was early everytime. For the record, where I work we operate on flexy time, I regularly come to work an hour and a half earlier then is needed and have never been late... But this isn't about me, like I said, its about trust. 

&gt;Care to comment on the people who've said they've been sanctioned for attending job interviews, telling the Jobcentre about them well in advance, getting verbal agreements from the staff, then finding out they've been sanctioned when their money doesn't turn up?

As I stated, we've all heard the -edge cases- where people have been sanctioned even though they've obtained agreements (I really would like to see the proof of these stories rather then ""someone on reddit said that their friends friend said..."") with their case workers. Still doesn't really change the simple fact that if you're not turning up to an interview you should not be getting DWP. Lets not confuse -edge case- poor case workers not taking on board what their clients are saying with the simple fact that if you can't be arsed to turn up to interviews and help your self find a job why should the DWP be arsed to help you.

&gt;The JCP will go to great lengths to tell you that the courses are mandatory and a no-show will result in a sanction. So let's go back to the first point and discuss what counts as a no-show, and let's mention illness, family crises, inability to pay for childcare, inability to pay for travel...

I think I clearly stated what counts as a no show, remembering that benefits doesn't have the notion of sick pay... So you will, quite simply  need to prove you were ill. This goes back to my first point... Trust.

As for travelling expenses, [what are you on about?](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-to-help-with-the-cost-of-transport/support-to-help-with-the-cost-of-transport). 

And paying for child care, [are we talking about the same thing?](http://www.gingerbread.org.uk/factsheet/32/Jobseeker%E2%80%99s-allowance-%E2%80%93-special-rules-for-single-parents)

&gt;Out of interest, how many mouths does your fiancee have to feed? Did she earn enough from her second, paying job to feed an average family of four, pay rent, council tax, cover childcare, travel, medical bills? That must have been an amazingly well paid part time job she had, there.

I just said, we are busy paying for everyone elses children and can't afford our own.

&gt;So the next time you're late to a meeting at work and they dock a week's pay, or three months' pay, that's fine by you and only fair, is it?

Like I said, there's a level of trust between me and my employer, the DWP holds no such level of trust between itself and claimants, you will need to prove yourself or be treated with prejudice.

&gt;OK, well in that case, I'm sorry for wasting your time. Every single instance of bad treatment and unfair sanctions is completely the filthy chav scum workshy waster's fault, then. Glad we've sorted that out.

Like I said, there are edge cases where the DWP gets it wrong, it seems those stories seem to be the loudest out of the millions of claimants.

The Anti-discrimination directives - based around Racial discrimination, gender discrimination and disability discrimination. Also gender and equality through goods and services regulations.

You might know the last one; that directive led to the abolishing of gender-risk evaluations - i.e. Charging men more than women because we're ""riskier"" drivers.

They were also the ones who standardized things like roaming data charges and are responsible for the one-make phone chargers rather than the twenty different types of models that were available some five or six years ago.

There's far too many to list, a lot of the laws they come out with are actually quite sensible. The media likes to throw away stories like the 'banana length and bend' crap, but that's a misinterpretion of law and usually any issues arising from that tends to be caused by governmental misunderstanding of the law (i.e. the UK Parliament or council's being far too literal/zealous about things). 

That isn't to say none of the laws are silly or overtly complex, but stuff like the TPD is really simple regulation changes for an unregulated market. Most of what I've read about the regulations seems reasonable enough, the reaction though is ever so dramatic, a 'black market', selling 'tanks under trench coats!' and whatnot, which is frankly ridiculous.

There, we have one of the big problems. Despite benefits fraud being a problem in just 0.7% of claims everyone, the other 99.3% of claimants are assumed to be fraudsters also. There is no trust, there is only mistrust. Without doubt, the majority of those 99.3% of legitimate claimants just want to get by and try to find a job. What they don't need is to be treated like a criminal and made to beg and walk over glass to ""earn"" the money they need for their family to eat this fortnight.

And here, we see the fundamental failing in your arguments...The DWP are not there to help you.

On the other hand, the jobs they have earmarked for me have been inappropriate, untenable or scam home-marketing schemes.

JCP is **not there to help you**. I can't say that vehemently enough.

If you want a specific one, take the McLibel case, where EU ruled that the UK libel laws violated the EU right to free expression, and awarded damages from the UK government.  Or [this](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/19/eu-court-rules-uk-government-must-clean-up-dangerous-air-pollution) one on air polution laws.  A more recent one is the recent prisoner voting ban, though that's an oddity in that the lawsuit was deemed valid in that UK law was deemed in violation of the EU laws, but the court didn't actually award compensation.  [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=EU+rendition+lawsuit&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=vID0VOuXOpDvaIHigJAE#q=UK+government+sued+european+court) it and you'll find a bunch. 

&gt;When has a UK citizen sued the UK government following the removal of benefits

You're backpedalling a lot here.  This isn't about removal of *benefits*, but of failing to live up to a promised exchange.  As it happens, no, I'm not aware of any such suits, which isn't surprising given that I'm not aware of any government so stupid as to actually **do** this.  They avoid retroactive changes like the plague, for good reason, hence why the changes they make to pensions going forward are all staged based on date of birth.

&gt;You're obviously keen to raise taxes

Not particularly, I just think it's a **far** better approach than your proposal in pretty much every conceivable way.  It accomplishes the same ends without a huge violation of governmental trust, would raise more with less upset and wastage, and would target the rich in general rather than just a particular subset that you deem worthy of having their contributions confiscated just because they're old.

&gt;If it makes you feel any better let's institute a tax on income from state pensions

Again, why?  Why victimise the old and wealthy in preference to everyone who is wealthy?  This all amounts to exactly the same issues - it just makes it even more clear that your policy is all about targetting the old in particular, rather than just the wealthy.

&gt;It most certainly is free money

I'm failing to see how they got this money for free, when they've spent their whole lifetime paying for it.  They may get out more than they put in (or at least, would if you don't pinch it off them), but that's still something they've paid for.  The same applies to my savings account after all, but that money wasn't free.  And once you take that money, they've contributed a substantial sum for absolutely no gain - I find it hard to see how you could interpret that as free.  Free means it didn't actually cost them anything to get.

&gt;Pensioners ""lifetime of contributions"" doesn't come close to covering the cost of the state pension. It's free money we're handing out. Financed by the taxpayer. 

For the rich, it certainly did.  They've contributed more than their share.  If this is the basis, you ought to be giving those a refund, and only confiscating the pensions of the poor.

Cinema - If it's not busy, no one is gonna do anything if you subtly move into the bigger chairs as the film starts. If it is busy, get an aisle seat (you can usually choose). 

Planes - Get a seat that's at the front of the section, ie; first row of economy. There's almost always a curtain and kitchen area between each section so you will have a lot of leg room in those seats. Disadvantage is the TVs are at awkward angles. 

Trains - Get a table seat. I've always booked tables because I plug my phone/laptop in to the chargers and do work, but I usually find they have more leg room (especially if it's off peak and there's no one on the other side to you).

Only provided the UK wishes to stay in the EU. If the UK government wanted it could leave the EU quite easily and not be bound by those rulings.

Do you have an example where the UK would be precluded from removing a state benefit?

&gt;You're backpedalling a lot here. This isn't about removal of benefits, but of failing to live up to a promised exchange. 

No I'm not. The state pension is a state benefit. Not a promised exchange. There is no contract between the government and UK citizens on the state pension. It isn't a commercial agreement.

Because i'm trying to target the old and wealthy's state pension benefits. I'm just calling a tax to make you feel better about it.

Because they're getting back more than they contributed. Payments - contributions = £X free money.

null,false,BooksBiscuitsTea,null,null,null,"I participated in the last /r/unitedkingdom thread on the topic; I'll try to be less long-winded here [and less screamy ranty.]. People are calling it a TV Tax - the strange thing, is that the TV Licence **is** a tax - the Office of National Statistics re-classified the TV Licence as a Hypothecated tax back in 2006.

[""Hypothecated"" essentially means ring-fenced. So the Government couldn't use the money to bomb the shit out of a parts of the World most people couldn't point to on a map if their lives depended on it]

Essentially, by introducing a household levy, the existing TV licence would move from a *voluntary* Hypothecated tax / Hypothecated tax with legal loopholes, to a *mandatory* Hypothecated tax.

Now both the previous thread - and from what I've seen whilst tentatively browsing the current one - contained numerous instances of people arguing about taxation, and paying for services one does / doesn't use.

Essentially, the whole series of arguments can be boiled down to this question: Does the BBC provide sufficient services in the lives of the vast majority of residents of the United Kingdom, so as to necessitate taxation?

Take for example Council Tax: Some people will argue they only get their bins collected out of it; that might be the only visible / obvious service, but it pays for policing, fire services and schools. That last part is important - even for people like me who are childless - I might not benefit *directly* from my council tax going towards schooling, but I'd benefit *indirectly* as those kids would be educated - hopefully - to a standard to allow them to flourish and have good careers; removing the need for them to receive out of work welfare payments, and paying into the system through taxation and spending.

Similarly with taxation being spend on the roads; I might not drive, but if the road infrastructure fell apart that'd have a massively detrimental affect on my quality of life; the public transport I use relies on it; good and services I use - not least of all food, would ground to a halt without continued investment.

I disagree with the notion of a 'household levy' because, unlike when the Licence fee was first introduced in 1946, the need for a mandatory funded public broadcaster is no longer necessary. Remember this proposed levy would be introduced in 2026; The world has changed in ways indescribable between 1946 : 2015, one can only imagine how different the world will be in 2026.

The notion of the family sitting around the television and listening to the news; watching a certain programme is outdated now; the very notion of ""Appointment Television"" is almost a thing of the past; Project forwards eleven years and I doubt that will change.

Then there's the question of the BBC as a public service, facilitating the delivery of the arts, of unbiased news content, of programming not deemed commercial but of sufficient merit to minority groups. All of that, I'd argue, was true of the past. But I struggle to support that notion now; let alone a decade and change into the future.

**So what should change?**

* Put iPlayer behind a paywall. People always shoot this down; it's not that difficult. It works for Netflix and any number of on demand services. Require users to login with their existing TV licence number. If you want to ensure people can't ""lend out"" their login details, necessitate people to scan a QR code via webcam.

* Incorporate strong encryption into the platform that will replace Freeview. This proposed household levy is being talked about as being introduced in 2026; Freeview as it exists now will be long obsolete. Whilst planning the technical specifications for the replacement - H265 / Bitrates etc. etc., include encryption. That way you give manufacturers sufficient time to incorporate an authentication method into Televisions / cable boxes / STBs that would immediately prevent people from watching who aren't licensed.",null,0,null,1425313620,null,0,false,0,cp1wuxg,null,t3_2xoahi,null,t1_cp1wuxg,null,t3_2xoahi,null,null,null,1427537290,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

The main problem I find with the BBC is that it's funding is a sword of Damocles ready to be pulled at any moment and that the BBC has to toe the line especially in news coverage. For commercial broadcasters we know everything begins and ends with money but public opinion is far more fickle

What can the BBC do?

1. Maintain the status quo. Seems one of the best ways on paper but it's suited for a past age where there is no on demand access

2. Introduce subscription charges. Whilst it would let those who wanted the content pay for it can you argue that it's a public broadcaster if only part of the population can have it? Content would inevitably become what subscribers wanted pushing it further away from public broadcasting. I suppose you could introduce a subscription for iPlayer but that'd still affect the content

3. Fund it out of general taxation. One of the better options I admit but rightly or wrongly successive governments have been offloading public services instead of bringing them back. Any tax income would have to be ring fenced.

The levy is most similar to 3 since it will essentially be a form of taxation but it is more likely to be ring fenced.",null,0,null,1425314103,null,0,false,0,cp1x4ts,null,t3_2xoahi,null,t1_cp1x4ts,null,t3_2xoahi,null,null,null,1427537419,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

What they don't need is to be treated like a criminal and made to beg and walk over glass to ""earn"" the money they need for their family to eat this fortnight.

That same mistrust you are talking about is the exact same reason why said people have to ""earn"" their money, because the trust has slowly been eroded away. 
By that 0.7%? maybe more then likely by the larger figures that have been taking advantage of the system ever since it was put in place.

Define ""fair"". 

If you divide the cost *equally* then it's much more burdensome for the poor than the wealthy. Even if you split the cost by taking the same proportion of everyone's income then it's *better*, but still more burdensome on those with least (because they spend the highest portion of their income on basic necessities and fixed costs)

So then you're into the realm of progressive taxation, which is widely reckoned to be a Good Thing, and will almost certainly have the net effect of transferring wealth via taxing the rich more heavily and subsidising the expenses of the poor.

He's like Holtby was: constantly moving, tackling, pressing, but unlike Holtby, he actually has really good positioning.  Watch our first pass when we get the ball back, it often goes to Mason who then moves it up to another player.  That transition player is underrated.  Compare him to someone like Paulinho, who, when he comes in, totally stagnates our attack. 

He is not without faults.  His long shots are usually awful, even though I do think it is part of his role to take them, but think if we'd had Siggy's shot yesterday instead of Mason from distance.  Also, while his passes are critical, he forces too many.  I think this aspect can improve though as you have to realize he's only been seeing PL caliber opposition for about 6 months.

Here is the ultimate issue.  How much does it cost to buy a midfielder that can play our pressing style and make critical forward passes.  Paulinho was/is an expensive flop.  Stambouli (though more defensive) hasn't contributed.  Capoue may be dead.  Holtby is shagging flight attendants in Germany.  Siggy is in Swansea.  These are all midfield players bought in the last 3 years who haven't worked in this position.  

I'm willing to take Mason in this transitional season, and see if he can improve.

I don't want Sky TV, so I don't pay any money to Sky, and if I look at the Sky news website I have to put up with ads on the page.  It's a fair point why that statement shouldn't also be true for the BBC.

Taking our chances? *Sigh* Hopefully Ki makes a nice run, Jonjo hits a screamer or Siggy pounces on a rebound. I have no confidence in Gomis to score.

Spurs come out fast and attacking early on and grab an early goal. We respond with a scrappy one that was the result of a deflected Shelvey shot.
