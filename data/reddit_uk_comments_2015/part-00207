How would you propose to decide who's all clean and above board and doesn't deserve to be regulated as strictly, and why do you think that's fair and reasonable?

All this stuff you're quoting's just the usual complaints that any and all industry bodies make when somebody tries to make things better by regulating them.  Everybody does it.

For example, the car industry wanted to be allowed to continue pumping neurotoxins into the atmosphere and stunting children's brain growth, because GM owned the patent on tetraethyl lead and made a lot of money out of it.  For another example, the industry conducted a PR campaign asserting it was safer to be thrown out of a car in a crash than to be restrained by a seatbelt because they didn't want to spend the money on fitting them.

I think that if the UK really hopes to exist through the 21st century it needs a federation or confederation of the home countries with each nation sending an equal number of members to parliament, and devolution on pretty much every front bar defence, fiscal policy, and foreign affairs.

For the league structure there is 12 teams currently with a view to change it. There is one automatic relegation place and one play-off between second bottom in the league and a championship side (as you may have saw yesterday with the Rangers an the Motherwell). 

There is currently one Champions league qualifying rounds place (the winner of the league) and three Europa league qualifying places (one in the cup, and two to the second and third place teams in the league)

The league also splits at the 33 game mark to two mini-leagues of six. It's meant to spice up the relegation  and European spots but these places are usually finalised by then.

This season saw St Mirren (from Paisley) get relegated automatically and Motherwell play Rangers in the play-off. Celtic finished top with Aberdeen second and Inverness finishing third whilst winning the cup giving 4th place St Johnstone a European place.

Top six in order were Celtic, Aberdeen, Inverness, St Johnstone (Perth), Dundee United, Dundee

Bottom six in Order were Hamilton, Partick Thislte, Ross County, Kilmarnock, Motherwell and St Mirren.

In the absence of UKIP as a protest vote outlet nationally, I wouldn't be surprised if more regional parties like Yorkshire First had done better over the last couple of elections, simply because they have a regionally-focussed outlook.

People don't function like that though. In general people although electing an individual vote on national lines. They vote for a party. MPs are usually elected or dethroned on national swings, not on their ability.

None of these targets are in this category. Players like Reus, Pedro,  Aubameyang are the type of players / calibre we need.

See my post history for the number of times I've complained here about this!  Consequently, there just aren't enough staff being trained in appropriate fields to fill the kind of permanent posts the NHS needs.

If a Hospital has been advertising for 7 months for a District Nurse (as an example), with no qualified candidates applying, they have to fill the gap somehow.  And inevitably, locum clinicians are the current answer.  Not the best qualified, but enough to keep the post barely covered until a competent permanent staff member can be found.

And of course, NHS clinicians realise this too - and there's been a huge move away from permanent employment towards locum work.  It pays better (even with the agency taking a cut), you can pick and chose when you work, where you work.  It's not like there's a shortage of positions available either.

It's the inevitable result of a failure of workforce planning, no pay rises, incredibly low morale and an expectation of more work from staff - and it's deeply harmful to the NHS.  It's not just that it costs more to the NHS, it's that no matter how good the locum clinician is, they won't be familiar with locally specific practices and mistakes are more common when a locum clinician has been working at 3 Hospitals over the space of the last fortnight.

&gt; ""The police have confirmed they WILL act on ANY inappropriate behaviour and we, the organisers will support that.""

And from the Cambridge News article you kindly provided:

&gt; ""So long as people don't act in an inappropriate or offensive way, they will not be committing an offence.""

There you have choice quotes from attendees, organisers and Police, which plainly state that any inappropriate behaviour, which this clearly was, would be construed as an offence, and you have an attendee using the very word ""horrible"".

Now, you see, we in this country have a free press. They are not bound by the constraints of a central publishing house that dictates how each story is presented. They can report events any way they choose. It would have been easy to gloss over the bloke with the unfortunate erection and report on the bike ride alone. The Cambridge News article suggests that it's only the third time the ride's taken place there, so the very fact of its' existence is news, they didn't have to focus on the one negative occurrence at all.

It's not an opinion piece by the Mirror directly, but neither does the article exist in a vaccuum. Whatever reporter attended the event and wrote up the piece had a choice to make about how it was reported, had an idea of what publications their report would be published in and will have tailored it to suit the intended audience. They would have had free choice over the quotes they included, the witnesses they took note of, and consistently chose to report the occurrence in a negative light.

How do we know the man in question wasn't allowed back in the event after controlling himself? It's implied that he might have been there just for the self titillation, with a facebook message from an organiser saying ""we don't tolerate this"". Without context, it's easy to read it as a pervert attending a naked event to get an eyeful and satisfy his own arousal, where we simply don't know if that's true at all.

The kicker is that link to the video of the topless women singing in their car. Apparently it's fine for tens, maybe hundreds of thousands to partake of some partial nudity if it's women who are getting naked, but one man amongst dozens who has an unfortunately timed boner is treated like a naughty boy who should know better and put it away.

I'm sorry you don't see it, but it's clearly a case of double standards, whoever wrote the article. 

If it's not, why did the Mirror actively choose to link an article where a naked man is admonished to a celebratory article about three topless women?

Actually, here's a point that should put things in context. It's a fact that friction can induce an erection - the friction of riding a bicycle, for example...especially naked, I'd imagine. There's nothing sexual about the erection, just as there's nothing sexual about the morning erection blokes tend to get when they need the loo first thing in the morning.

Now consider that, in the cold, a woman's nipples become erect, too. While erect nipples are indeed an outward sign of female arousal, that's usually not the case. Can you ever imagine an article being written about a woman who was taken aside by the police and admonished for having erect nipples?

But in the colonies they can spread out, hence bigger roads and cars in North America and Australia. Everything has been planned out to be a perfect layout. In Europe we built roads too small pre-20th century and now we can't expand some of them because we have buildings in the way.

Then obviously something we share with the colonies more than Europe is language, although Europe has learned English, but there's a more British-centric culture in the colonies than Europe.

I think another thing which makes us different is being on islands. We can't just pop over the border to do some shopping or spend time in another country off the bat.

It seems to me to be pretty obviously 'wrong' that the Tories won a majority with 37% of the vote, and even more 'wrong' that Labour won a larger majority with a smaller share of the vote in '05. But at least in '05, vote share broadly predicted who had more seats: The party with most votes had most seats; the one with the third most votes had the third most seats, etc.

This time, the party with the **5th** highest share of the vote has come **3rd** in terms of seats (SNP) and the party with the **3rd** highest share of the vote has come a joint *10th* in terms of seats (Ukip), getting the same number of seats as a party that came 6th in vote share (the Greens).

Even if we momentarily discount regional parties, which somewhat inevitably distort things, we see that the parties in third and fourth on national vote share (Ukip and Lib Dems, respectively) are in the 'wrong order' on number of seats.

Even within the regions, the results are off. We don't really need to talk about Scotland as it's been said so many times but, come on: Labour get a quarter of the vote and get one seat, the same as the Lib Dems, who got less than a tenth of the vote? That cannot be right.

Northern Ireland didn't have an SNP-style landslide, but their results are still off, with the SDLP getting three seats to the UUP's two, despite the UUP getting more votes. Of course, the NI result is also crazily disproportionate, with the DUP taking 8 seats with 184,260 votes while Sinn Fein got half the number of seats while being just 8,000 votes behind (176,232).

I haven't seen a proper vote breakdown for Wales, but the article mentions that that result, too, was disproportionate. Given that there are 40 Welsh seats, of which Labour got 25, and that it seems fairly unlikely that more than 50% of Welsh people voted Labour, I'm inclinced to assume that the article's right!

The Guardian's been in favour of voting reform for a long time now, so in any case your argument is off the mark. Additionally, I feel I have to point out that the Guardian is a traditionally Liberal newspaper, and the electoral system hardly seems likely to start being biased towards the Lib Dems any time soon!

The NHS won't employ enough full-time nurses to run services properly, but instead rely on NHS bank and private agency nurses to plug the gaps ""when needed"". So the regular nurses work their asses off each day, and see these agency nurses coming in to do less work (as they don't have the same ongoing responsibilities, just one shift's worth) for more money. The regular nurses get fed up with that and become agency nurses instead. The unit is now even more understaffed and so needs to employ more agency nurses...

This can be solved with some long-term planning. Employ enough staff in the first place, build a bit of resiliency into the system so that yes you may have the occasional extra nurse when you're quiet, but you're not relying on agency staff when things get busy or someone calls in sick. The workload is shared across more people, so there's less stress and less reason for people to quit. Of course the problem is that employing those extra nurses would be seen as ""waste"" and would be the first thing to get cut back when the budget gets tight. 

Like virtually every public service, the NHS runs largely on good will.

null,false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,null,"This is completely misleading, all the difference is that ""rape"" is legally defined in the SOA 2003 as a penis being inserted into someone.

What someone who rapes a man can be charged with is [causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/causing-sexual-activity-without-consent), namely the sections:

&gt;(1)A person (A) commits an offence if—

&gt;(a)he intentionally causes another person (B) to engage in an activity,

&gt;(b)the activity is sexual,

&gt;(c)B does not consent to engaging in the activity, and

&gt;(d)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.

&gt;(2)Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.

&gt;(3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.

&gt;(4)A person guilty of an offence under this section, if the activity caused involved—

&gt;(a)penetration of B’s anus or vagina,

&gt;(b)penetration of B’s mouth with a person’s penis,

&gt;(c)penetration of a person’s anus or vagina with a part of B’s body or by B with anything else, or

&gt;(d)penetration of a person’s mouth with B’s penis,is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

It carries the exact same punishment as rape: a maximum of life in prison.

The legal ""he"" here refers to 'a person', not 'a man'. It's just old fashioned legalese tradition to not use the gender-neutral they. In the CPS [sentencing guidelines](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s4_causing_sexual_activity/) there is no mention of gender, and women have been tried for this repeatedly, namely in [R v Kizlaite &amp; Anor](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2006/1492.html) - six years for forcing someone to have sex - [R v Notice](http://www.thelawpages.com/court-cases/Yasmine-Notice-9601-1.law) - seven years and two months for making a vulnerable man perform sex acts - and [R v Berry](http://www.thelawpages.com/court-cases/Joanne-Berry-13803-1.law) - six years just for making the real threat of rape.

You're twisting the law disingenuously to suit your agenda - the only reason that there is a lack of sentences for full-on male rape is that it is still pretty uncommon or underreported. It's a problem, but to suggest that there is no legal recourse for men who have been raped is completely wrong as if you care to read the rest of the Act you cited, you'll see that there are offences covering it with exactly the same punishment.",null,0,null,1433161459,null,0,false,0,crrrffx,null,t3_381y79,null,t1_crrrffx,null,t1_crrpqqq,null,null,null,1436632999,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

 Support is growing within the Church of England to rewrite its official liturgy to refer to God as female following the selection of the first women bishops.

Growing numbers of priests already insert words such as “she” and “mother” informally into traditional service texts as part of a move to make the language of worship more inclusive, it has been claimed.

But calls for a full overhaul of liturgy to recognise the equal status of women have already been discussed informally at a senior level.

It comes after the “Transformations Steering Group”, a body which meets in Lambeth Palace to examine the impact of women in ministry on the Church of England, issued a public call to the bishops to encourage more “expansive language and imagery about God”.

Hilary Cotton, chair of Women And The Church (Watch), the group which led the campaign for female bishops, said the shift away from the traditional patriarchal language of the Book of Common Prayer in already at an “advanced” stage in some quarters. 

 “The reality is that in many churches up and down the country something more than the almost default male language about God is already being used,” she said.

“Quietly clergy are just talking about God as ‘she’ every now and then.

“The response you often get at one end is ‘why does it matter because God is beyond all this?’

“At the other end the reaction is ‘you mustn’t because Jesus calls God father.”

Bishop Libby Lane at Chester Cathedral (Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph)

Mrs Cotton said that while congregations were already experimenting with new terminology, it was time for the issue to be considered by the Liturgical Commission, the body which drafts official service books, as well as those drawing behind a planned new catechism.

“Until we shift considerably towards a more gender-full expression in our worship about God then we are failing God and we are missing something,” she said.

“We are [also] going to miss some of the opportunities that otherwise particularly women might feel themselves called to.”

Her comments came following a discussion at the Westminster Faith Debates on whether the consecration of women as bishops would “change” the Church of England.

The Church of England’s worship already includes some references to God as female, many of them centuries old.

• First woman bishop Libby Lane: a century of campaigning

Canticle 82, the song of Anselm, the 11th and 12th Century Archbishop of Canterbury, likens Jesus to a mother, while number 86, attributed to Julian of Norwich, speaks of God as “our mother in all things”.

“That gives an indication that the Church of England hasn’t set its face against this in any way and there is recognition from the Church of England that men and women are made in the image of God and therefore it is entirely appropriate to express our worship toward God as a female presence,” said Mrs Cotton.

“There is a thin thread of this throughout history but having women bishops makes it particularly obvious that … to continue to refer to God purely as male is just unhelpful to many people now.”

A spokesman for Lambeth Palace emphasised that the steering group is independent of the Archbishop of Canterbury and that any change in liturgy would have to be approved by the General Synod.

Sir James Dutton, a highly-decorated Nato commander, is said to have become weary of the ceremonial role 

 The governor of Gibraltar has announced his resignation after less than two years in the role, after growing frustrated at the Foreign Office's failure to stand up to Spanish aggression.

Sir James Dutton's decision to step down is unprecedented in the modern history of Gibraltar.

A highly-decorated Lieutenant General who spent 37 years in the Marines, the 61-year-old was said to feel that he had been ""sold a duff"" by the Foreign Office, and become increasingly irritated at the toothless British response. Instead of playing an active role in defending Gibraltarian interests in the face of Spanish sabre-rattling, he discovered that his role was simply to liaise between the Foreign Office and the government of Gibraltar.

""He then got here and found he was essentially a go-between,"" a source close to the governor told The Telegraph. ""It's an unpleasant phrase, but he was essentially a ribbon cutter. You can't blame him for getting frustrated.""

Sir James is said to have told friends that the Foreign Office built up the job, to try and encourage him to accept. And The Express reported that, while he had been unhappy with his position for some time, it was only after the Conservative re-election – which saw David Lidington, the Europe Minister, keep his post – that he took the decision to finally leave.

In his resignation speech, Sir James said the job was ""more representational and ceremonial than I had expected"". The surprise announcement left the Foreign Office scrabbling to find a suitable replacement before September, when he will step down. His predecessor, Sir Adrian Johns, served for four years. In 2012 he told The Telegraph of his irritation at Spanish aggression towards the territory - which has increased since the election of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in 2011.

Mr Rajoy's centre-Right Partido Popular (PP) takes a more confrontational stance than the opposition PSOE. And the election of Mr Rajoy coincided with the election of a new Chief Minister in Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, who has also refused to shy away from a strident defence of Gibraltar's status.

The result has been a tense few years in the southern Mediterranean.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has blocked the Spanish-Gibraltarian border and Spanish vessels have staged numerous unlawful incursions into British territorial waters around the Rock.

In 2013, Spain’s ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office after a Spanish ship entered waters off Gibraltar.

Then Spanish officials caused anger by opening a British diplomatic bag at the border with Gibraltar.

In December last year, Robert Goodwill, the transport minister, stormed out of a top-level meeting after EU chiefs agreed with Spain to exclude Gibraltar from an important air safety deal. And last week Gibraltar was forced to deny what it termed ""alarmist"" reports in the Spanish press suggesting that HMS Ambush, docked in Gibraltar's port, posed a ""nuclear"" threat.

Sir James took the job in December 2013, leaving behind a high-profile role with construction and engineering company Bechtel Corporation in Gabon and Qatar.

And before moving to the private sector, he was one of Britain's top military officers, serving as deputy commander for the Nato-led international forces in Afghanistan. He was Commandant General of the Royal Marines, and Commander of the UK Amphibious Forces.

He had also served in Washington, as the Chief of Defence Staff’s liaison officer to the American military, and inside the Ministry of Defence, as the director for Nato.

When his Gibraltar role was announced, he said he was looking forward to putting his military and commercial experience to good use.

""I am delighted and honoured to be going to Gibraltar, especially given its historical connections with the Royal Marines,"" he said.

""I hope that my many years of military experience combined now with three years of commercial experience will equip me well to deliver the Governor’s role and responsibilities toward Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.""

The Foreign Office has already begun searching for his successor.

Gibraltarians told The Telegraph they were hoping for Sir James's replacement to have an equally distinguished military record.

""We want a military governor – they are straight-talking, and don't muck around,"" said one. ""If you get a retired general or admiral they can be blunt – unlike the men in suits. They really do defend our interests.""

You don't seem to understand what punitive means. They wouldn't be violating WTO rules by not granting us a free trade agreement. If they treated us differently than the way they treat other countries with no existing trade deals and we could prove it was punitive then they would be breaking the rules. Not agreeing to a trade deal is not punitive, they are fully within their rights to do so. 

They are not going to let us walk away from things consequence free, if they give us a trade deal it will not be instant and it will not be without requirements we have to follow. This isn't just about money. It would be politically stupid to sort out a free trade deal straight away as people will still be sour about us leaving (kind of like how we had no plans to have a currency union with an independent Scotland even if it would have been mutually beneficial). Furthermore they don't want to set a bad precedent that other countries might follow when it suits them.

I watched part of the Indy 500 the other weekend and found the whole experience far more alien - and disturbing - than anything I ever encountered in my travels around Europe. Everyone at the stadium engaged in mass prayer, which was intertwined with a whole load of military worship and (from my point of view) extreme nationalism. Pretty much any sports event will include mass recitals of the national anthem. It's commonplace in schools. The level of religious enforcement and nationalism is just not seen here.

I think this kind of ""happy accident"" has happened quite a bit in the past, where a party resonates with the electorate and a decisive change happens in the complexion of parliament, even though not everyone was on board - eg Blair's landslide in 1997, despite only having 43% of the vote.

It's the situation in England at the last election - especially the disparity for the Greens and UKIP between, not just the number of votes, but the huge uptick in popular support and their paltry one seat each - that shows the current system has failed.

From my experience, the working conditions of the schools depends so much on the senior management. After reading the article, it seems the majority of the complaints should have been dealt by the senior management team. The only complaints a subject teacher should be dealing with is subject related or any extra curricular activity they are running or a part of. And even then, the head of department usually deals with the serious subject related complaints such as ""I don't want this teacher to teach my child.""


Subject focused teachers should be let alone to focus on teaching their subject not deal with external concerns like these.

Because it will. I'm a truck driver.

My employer has to have in place monitoring procedures and recording procedures for these hours as well which causes them grief and a not insignificant amount of expense in card readers, hours management software and use of external companies to do tacho analysis. If I work for more than one company, every company has to keep a record of the hours I've done at the others. 

Not being in the EU we would no longer have to comply with all of this and the grief it causes and would return to the GB Domestic regulations we previously had which were actually MORE SAFE than the EU ones which replaced them. Under the GB rules we had we had a maximum 11hr working day, not 15hrs or 21 out of every 30hrs if double manning which we have under EU rules meaning it is legal for a truck driver in a 2.5 day period to work more hours than most people would work in a week.",null,0,null,1433163203,null,0,false,0,crrs1rx,null,t3_37y7md,null,t1_crrs1rx,null,t1_crrrnby,null,null,null,1436633473,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Putinfanboy1000,null,null,null,"There’s a very good study by a well-known sociologist, Benjamin Ginsberg, called ""The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters"". It has many repercussions. One effect of imposition of a business model is a drive towards what is called efficiency, which is an interesting concept. “Efficiency” is not really an economic concept. As I already mentioned, transferring costs to individuals is called “efficiency.” We see that all the time. So suppose you call a bank or an airline to check on an error or for information. You know what happens: You get a recorded message, which tells you “we love your business, we love you. Please hang on!”

…
The same applies when the corporate culture is imposed on universities. One way to achieve efficiency is to reduce the proportion of faculty to students. Replace faculty by cheap labor — temps — just like in the business world. In this case graduate students for instance. They are easily replaceable and exploitable. You don’t pay them much and they can’t ask for their rights. It is very good for the bottom line, the professional business administrators, who are running the colleges. The harm done to the students is not counted. That is part of the ideological character of cost estimates. Another strategy is eliminating programs that are too expensive.

…

null,false,ihateirony,irish,Irish Expat in London,null,"Votes aren't cast at random, but there are a large number of factors that affect votes and that adds an element of randomness to the mix. For example, perhaps if a referendum were run right after the UK general elections then there would be enough consciousness about the difference in voting patterns between England and Scotland (regarding the tendency of Scotland to vote more left) that some Scottish voters might be feeling very anti-UK that week and vote to break the union. However, perhaps if you asked them again in a few more weeks once they see that while tory rule sucks, it isn't the end of the world those break the union votes might become votes to maintain it.

This is a single example of one factor. This single factor may not be enough to to push the vote over the edge, but likely there exists a sweetspot of a number of factors intersecting that would indeed push the vote over the edge. If you have referenda frequently enough you are eventually going to hit that sweet spot and get a yes vote, even though it's possible that if you had planned the referendum to be a few weeks later then you may have gotten a no vote. In this sense, it is somewhat like rolling dice over and over until you get a six. This is one of the reasons why in science we try to replicate findings.

Don't get me wrong. I'm from the Republic of Ireland and I was kind of invested in Scotland voting yes as a consequence, but I do think that the criticism you are dismissing is a valid one, and that setting a higher threshold may actually be a good solution. And independence may not be irreversible, but it would be extremely hard to reverse and very unlikely to happen. As far as I understand it's not uncommon to have systems like this in place for extremely consequential decisions for the very reasons of chance (for example, in a charity I volunteer in we require a 2/3 majority to alter the main part of our constitution). However, I think that putting a threshold in place would not be reasonable without the Scottish people voting one in place. If this were to be implemented the best thing to do would be to have the Scottish voters vote on that at the same time they vote on the next referendum. That way it can democratic and sensible (even though it likely would not pass, as probably more than 10% of the 55% of people who voted no last time would like the option to leave to still be pretty open).",null,0,null,1433164145,null,0,false,0,crrsep7,null,t3_382220,null,t1_crrsep7,null,t1_crrrgpv,null,null,null,1436633760,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Ings would be a great signing providing we do a bit of a clear out in the forwards area, but again he's more of a rotational option, he would be excellent cover for when Sturridge inevitably gets injured next season. We need a 20+ goal striker next season, and we would have to be very optimistic to rely on Ings for that.

Clyne would be a great signing for us. I think he would suit both the RB/RWB positions, as well as being a long term solution to our recent RB problems.

Well with the last vote outcome being settled by a very low margin (e.g. 3%) it is even more likely that if we referendum enough times eventually the countries will split, just by chance.

There is randomness in election outcomes.  Some people decide to vote on the day or not.  A piece of bad news for one party may just happen to come out the week before the election.  For example, suppose oil prices suddenly halved before a Scottish independence referendum, then that might cause a lot of people to change their minds about leaving the UK. Suppose another Parliament scandal happened just before the referendum - that might cause people to want to leave. Etc...


&gt; &gt; they should set the referendum threshold to a 75% (or similar) requirement yes-vote for independence.

&gt; Why? That seems bizarre and undemocratic.

Well that assumes my randomness analogy is correct.  For example, suppose a student needs to score 50% to pass an exam, but they know very little of that topic.  If they just turn up to the exam a sufficiently large number of times they will eventually pass it.  Hence the more times they are allowed to turn up to the exam, the higher we should set the pass threshold (if we want that exam qualification to signify anything meaningful).

Consumers can make the choice to consumer regulated goods or non-regulated goods.

The state can easily educate as to what a consumer is exposed to by purchasing non-educated goods, you don't have to know what goes into the regulation to know that there is a difference between regulated goods and non-regulated goods.

Companies will be far more inclined to stock regulated goods very quickly if non-regulated goods cause PR backlash which you would think they would go.

What countries have non-regulated goods markets? Is everyone there experiencing side effects that they were not aware of?

The next step is after you've taken the choice out of consumers hands, you take them further out and take away the goods all together which is what we have.

The government isn't just taking goods through a regulatory process and then telling consumers the complete information, they are banning goods that don't make it through, why? If you want to inform the consumer then why isn't warning them of side effects enough? If a good will kill you within a week of consuming it then you might argue that it's the government duty to LET PEOPLE KNOW, but to stop people from taking it is a completely different argument.

As you can see there are numerous better choices, having a regulatory and non-regulatory market, having all goods be processed before sale and not banning any of them, and having a free market.

Edit: Also as I said these kind of arguments apply via principle to the entire rest of consumers lives. Do consumers really know the benefits and downsides of pregnancy? No, then they should be denied pregnancy until they are aware? Do they even understand the labels on the food, no then they should be denied the food until they get a test? If they're uninformed and being uninformed means you shouldn't be making choices (or the government should be making them for you) then why aren't we checking for the presence of uninformedness.",null,0,null,1433164683,null,0,1433164874,0,crrsmiv,null,t3_37znq4,null,t1_crrsmiv,null,t1_crrs92y,null,null,null,1436634054,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I still think him and Vert would make a good partnership if they were given more time together, especially with Walker offering so much recovery pace on the other side of him.

&gt;The __Webster ruling__ is a [test case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law\)) in association football [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_law) involving [Andy Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Webster), a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) formerly with [Heart of Midlothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [transfer regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(football\)) of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), football's [governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body), which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) of 1995 in its potential significance.

We paid £800 for a five-piece band that didn't struggle for bookings - I think this was a bargain for how good they were, but we knew them ahead of time. 

I know people who've paid £2000+ for 7/8-piece bands for whom this was their main source of income and play a few nights per week plus weekends. They were very pro, travelled a long way to their bookings, and that cost them money. When I played in a 7-piece we were very *not* pro and played parties for £500ish, depending on who asked us and who in the band they spoke to. We weren't terrible, but we also weren't a patch on bands charging £800.

I know another couple who paid £400 for their wedding band. That was a risk. On the night they upped their game but the times we went to see them ahead of the night they were shit. I'd have not wanted that worry along with everything else, but then there are £300/night pub bands who are *amazing*. Obviously they'd charge more for a wedding, but that's weddings for you. It's your friend's risk to take.

I guess what I'm getting at is that you need to go and see a band first - at least I'd feel funny trusting a band for my wedding night without having seen them first, not just to judge their playing, but to see how professional they are, reliable, etc. I mean, are they all there on time? Can they set up the PA as well as they can play through it? Are those amazing live vids on their website a fluke, and four in every five other songs are rubbish? Are those three soul tracks on youtube the only three in a set made otherwise of plodding Kings Of Leon pub-rock?

Call a few up, ask where they're playing, what they charge, then have a few nights out watching them. It's the funnest kind of wedding prep there is.

They need to raise the staff budget so they don't have to keep redirecting emergency funds to Agencies.

Blame the Health Minister. Jeremy Hunt did this.

They've eroded the benefits of nurses. Then they started slashing the staffing budget to meet cuts. This means the NHS is understaffed constantly (which is illegal) and requires 'emergency' staff. This is a different budget - not the staff budget - allowing them to channel funds. These funds can be replenished with loans too which the staff budget can't be. Agencies take advantage of this by charging really high rates to make profit as well as cover their costs (insurance, accountancy, travel, convenience, etc.). It's a completely artificial situation created by the Health Minister. If a portion of the emergency staff budget was moved to allow hiring new staff it would be job done.

If that didn't compound the problem, estimates are as much as 22% of the NHS' staff are absent or on long term sick. This rose when they became short staffed.

We were successful and got an order limiting the times he could play his piano to certain hours of the day (allowing the flat owner to schedule visitation when he wouldn't be playing), and requiring him to remove the posters.

Jimmy Mac, keeps the team running.

**Most Improved - Who's been our most improved player, whether it be from last year or from the first half of the season to the second?**

Wilf in May is on a whole other level to Wilf in September.

**The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player - Who did we have high hopes for that let us down?**

Zeki Fryers. We were mugged for £3m.

**The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player - Who's the unsung hero of this team?**

Jimmy Mac again

**Goal of the Season - What's been your favourite Palace goal this year? Goals scored against us can also count; perhaps call those the Matty Phillips award.**

For has to be Punch against City, against is Phillips.

**High Point of the Season - What's been our best moment this season?**

Beating City- the first game I've been to where we've won in 14 years of on-off attendance and it was against the champions.

**Low Point of the Season - Conversely, what's been the most depressing moment of our season?**

The Sunderland defeat. Embarrassingly poor.

**The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents - Who, simply put, have been our bitches this past year? Equally, who's been the most satisfying to beat?**

Liverpool or City.

**The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill - I'm expecting the wingers to feature heavily here.**

Bolasie against Spurs.

**Most Impressive Individual Opposing Player - Which opposition player has been the most impressive against us?**

Yaya Toure- scored in both games and at Selhurst everything they did went through him.

You can't vote Plaid because they're too Welsh (this is beginning to change) and the only real choice left is between Labour and the Lib Dems - which aren't seen as an option for many people.

You end up with an electorate which votes Labour consistently because that's the only option. The needs of Wales are different from England and from Scotland, and I think Plaid are doing well to try to appeal to a broader range of Welsh voters. Language will always be an important issue to Plaid, as I think will independence, but they've been a bit quieter about that and louder about the things that really do make them different - their single-minded focus on Wales. 

You might say it's selfish but at the same time it is refreshing. There hasn't really been anyone pushing an entirely Welsh-focused agenda. Welsh people need to start at least engaging with that sort of narrative because at the moment lots of people in Wales seem to assume what's going on in England is the same as in Wales, and it usually isn't.

I've a couple of coins I got cheap in large batches, like £1 each, and a couple of these in particular you can find identical coins on dealer's sites at £50-£100 a pop. But that doesn't mean they'll ever sell at that price or that they're really worth that much to 99.99% of people. 

If you've a huge stock to sell, and most dealers do, it doesn't matter if you hugely overprice your goods and only sell one or two pieces per week. You can afford to hold out for someone to pay well over the odds, for whatever reason. If you're just getting rid of a handful of pieces, you'll not make nearly as much because you'll (probably) not want to wait 2/3 years for each sale. My ""£100"" coin would probably only make a fiver on ebay.

Personally, in OP's position I'd see what things are going for on ebay, and maybe have a chat about it with a dealer while understanding that if they sell them on they'll make more than I did. If either option is more than a face value exchange at the bank then quids in, I suppose.

I'm not sure in OPs case whether being abroad would increase the sale price of the notes. Might be worth his time looking at that too, might not.

&gt;The Electoral Reform Society commissioned a post-election
survey from YouGov, which ran from the 8th to the 12th of May
2015. The question was:

&gt;“Please imagine that the voting system used for General Election
in the United Kingdom asked you to rank the candidates in the order
that you wanted to vote for them.

&gt;Please indicate how you would have voted in the General Election
on Thursday 7th May, if you had been asked to rank the parties in
your order of preference. Put 1 for your most preferred party, then 2 for your second party, 3 for your third choice etc. You may rank as many or as few choices as you wish. If you would not vote, or do not know how you would vote, tick the boxes below.”

&gt;The sample size returned was 40,000, allowing for high-quality
and accurate analysis of regional data. As the data for our YouGov
poll covered Great Britain only, our projections under alternative
voting system only look at potential results in Great Britain, hence
the lack of data on Northern Ireland. While we could have provided
breakdowns for Northern Ireland (under pure percentage of the
vote terms or a D’Hondt system), we felt it was best to maintain
consistency

Their methodology took the results from this survey and combined it with the actual result to balance out the polling over the 650 seats.

&gt;Provided his review with the club’s owner ends without a P45, Brendan Rodgers wants a new strike force (Christian Benteke and Danny Ings), a central midfielder (James Milner), a right-back (Nathaniel Clyne) and a new goalkeeper. Liverpool’s miserable end to last season suggests they need far more while also filling the leadership void created by Steven Gerrard’s departure. Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini, José Enrique, Sebastián Coates, Luis Alberto and Iago Aspas could all leave along with the out-of-contract Glen Johnson and Brad Jones. There are doubts, too, over the future of Raheem Sterling. 

&gt;Top target: Christian Benteke (Aston Villa, £32.5m buy-out clause)

&gt;May end up with: Whoever is left after Tottenham Hotspur or Chelsea have nipped in to lure their targets elsewhere.

&gt;Transfer kitty: Around the £40m mark plus money raised from player sales.

&gt;Already signed: Divock Origi (Lille, £9.8m)

null,false,grogipher,null,null,null,"&gt; I am saying that if you are a political party in Scotland for a very few number of votes you get more seats. That goes against the every vote being equal

That's 100% rubbish though. To win a seat in Dundee, Derby or Derry, the bar is set in exactly the same place; you need to win more votes than anyone else within the constituency of c70,000 people. It's no different in Denbigh or Dunkeld, it doesn't matter if you're the Green Party of England and Wales or Mebyon Kernow. That argument is just false. 

*This* election, our broken electoral system meant that the SNP managed to win more seats than they should have, proportionally, compared to parties such as UKIP or the Greens or the Lib Dems. That's right. But that's **nothing** to do with the fact that they stood in Scotland. If they had the same vote share in any of the other 591 constituencies, they still would have won the same number of votes. 


&gt; This isn't marginal, it isn't to do with the SNP, its the fact that English voters get much less say than Scots who vote in similar numbers but get all of the MPs, press and bargaining power.

No no no no no no no! This *is* to do with the SNP. For all of the previous elections, FPTP has worked against the SNP. This time it worked for them. That's just the way FPTP works. It has *nothing* to do with Scotland at all. That's very misguided, if I can be kind. 

And before you say it, no, I'm not defending FPTP, it's absolutely rubbish and we shouldn't have another election anywhere in the UK using such an arcane system. But sentences like *""its the fact that English voters get much less say than Scots""* are laughably wrong. Voters in Scotland get 59 seats to represent them, while voters in England get 533. How does that give Scotland more MPs, or Bargaining Power? That's demonstrably untrue. As for press, well, that's an entirely different matter.

&gt;

&gt;The debate on __religiosity and intelligence__ explores the link between religiosity and issues related to intelligence and educational level (by country and on the individual level). Debates over religiosity may consider religious belief and/or practice, and may compare to atheism or to lack of religious affiliation or to lack of religious practice.

&gt;Most of the recent scientific studies have found a negative correlation between I.Q. and religiosity.   On the individual level, the education level is positively correlated with a belief in a God in African countries, and negatively correlated in Western countries. The frequency of church visits is however positively correlated with education level in English-speaking countries as well as in Protestant Europe. 

&gt;Studies have shown a strong link between national average IQ and atheism in society. Research shows   of twelve countries with atheism over 40%, all except two are in a moderate average IQ range of 94 to 100, with only one lower IQ than that range (Cuba) and only one higher IQ than that range ([Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), where practising members of the dominant religions, [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), may be described as atheist due to the lack of a required belief in God, see: [Religion in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Japan)). Countries with an average IQ below 92 are overwhelmingly religious with atheism under 10% (with the exception of Cuba) and often less than 2%. Of the nine countries with a high average IQ above 100, only two have more than 25% atheist (Japan and South Korea). The highest IQ nation, Singapore, has an atheism rate of 12%, with a further 5% having no specific religious affiliation (but not self-identifying as atheist).

Yeah, you kinda are.

&gt;If Rodgers couldn't get a decent striker last season when he had the money to spend, he won't do it this year.

He got Sturridge the season before that and as a whole we were underwhelmed at that prospect before we discovered he was amazing. We also wanted Sanchez, and Remy before they fell through so we can't say for sure that we won't get one for this season just because we didn't last season.

&gt;why spend more money on players, especially if they won't fit what Klopp wants to do

Klopp and Rodgers play football built on very similar principles. If we get players who fit Rodgers then 90% of them should fit Klopp with minimal adaptation.

&gt;waste even a half of a season when you can bring Klopp in and build his team with a transfer window right away? 

This is really the crux of the matter. Rodgers has given us a year of fantastic football and a year of dross. I think it's worth gambling half a season to see which of the two was the blip especially when we have a worthy replacement waiting in the wings. 

If we lose half a season then meh. We've got less to lose now than we have for a while. Stevie's ticking time-bomb has gone off so that pressure is gone. 

I'd rather lose a season working out whether our current young manager has what it takes to bring long term continued success than chuck him prematurely and have someone else find out that he does!",null,0,null,1433169246,null,0,false,0,crrur8l,null,t3_382sfy,null,t1_crrur8l,null,t1_crrudph,null,null,null,1436635742,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

I *didn't* say it was. I *didn't* defend FPTP. You're completely misrepresenting my views altogether. 

&gt; the SNP is a scottish party and got 56 seats for a ridiculously small number of votes.

The SNP got enough votes in each constituency to win. That's all that matters under the current system. 

&gt;  Seeing as the SNPs main target is against English politics of course that gets negative attention.

This is so wrong it is bordering on offensive. The SNP do not like **Westminster**. We've had this discussion already. If you're just going to go in circles, I will cease. 

&gt; The bar is not the same, the smaller population of Scotland means thats to get a seat you need a small number of votes, the raw numbers do not lie. Yes they are small constiuencies in England but overall, Scotland has so many more we have a situation where 4m votes is 56 seats.

100% false. I've already explained this. 

&gt; You cannot deny that the SNP are going to have far more of an influence in the next 4 years than UKIP. but for a similar number of votes.

I shan't. But you didn't say the SNP, you said Scotland. Do I have to say for a **THIRD** time that the SNP are not Scotland, Scotland is not the SNP? 

&gt; I agree and you mention that the system is a joke, and for rightly for for wrongly, the English are getting pissed with it because of the results recently. It goes both ways, they are pissed at the Tories too for such an overwhelming majority with only 24% of the votes.

There's no need to drink excessively? But regardless, any moves away from FPTP will be welcomed by me.. and the SNP!

&gt; People hate the Tories just as much as the SNP for doing it. 

For doing what?  Winning elections?

You're advocating investing outside of an ISA instead of inside.  That's still putting all your eggs in one basket, it's just a different basket.  It's highly unlikely that any regulatory change would both make being inside an ISA less favourable than being outside and prevent you getting your money out.

Pensions are more vulnerable under that argument because the money in those is assumed to be tied up so you have fewer options if the regime changes unfavourably.

&gt; I do not think 'why not' is conclusive enough. If there is no advantage of an ISA versus outside the ISA, why not outside the ISA?

My problem with scrapping HMA is this. Human rights need protecting from government and as a Brit specifically the *British government* . I want as many degrees of separation between government control and human rights as possible. 

So the argument of allowing more control to parliament doesn't sit well with me and seems counter intuitive to what I believe when it comes to human rights. I don't want parliament as the final arbiter of rights there to protect me from.... Parliament! Democracy and rights don't sit well with me , just because 51% voted the rights away of 49% doesn't make it right. 


I'm not actually a fan of the ECHR either as I believe its too weak, too many exceptions and it has allowed our current speech laws thus I see it as inadequate in that regard.

* b) Government buys loads of land across the nation, uses those apprentices/young workers along with skilled workers to build 200,000 homes a year.  Taxpayer funds the lot.  Public can buy the houses, government uses profits for local social improvements.
* c) Private companies who sit on land with planning permission to build will have that land repossessed if they don't start building within five years.
* d) Major tax incentives to encourage hauliers to use the motorway network at night, when it's mostly empty.  Idea being to remove artics from the motorways during the day and therefore reduce congestion.
* e) Dutch-style cycle network in every town and city, linking homes, businesses, schools, etc.  Reduces spending on fuel (more money for people to spend on other stuff), fewer fat people, epic future NHS savings.
* f) Strict Liability laws applied to transport - http://www.darkerside.org/2013/04/strict-liability-an-idiots-guide/
* g) National minimum wage increased to Living Wage for companies who can afford it (I'm no economist so I'll leave the details to those who know how to calculate this).
* h) Drug legalisation, limited to the soft stuff.  Heroin, Cocaine et al can get to fuck.  Make it a medical, not a criminal problem.

P 285;
&gt; Extensive evidence was presented by the parties in respect of the applicant’s re-trial in Jordan and thoroughly examined by the domestic courts. Moreover, in the course of the proceedings before this Court, the applicant has presented further concrete and compelling evidence that his co-defendants were tortured into providing the case against him.

&gt; His is not the general and unspecific complaint that was made in Mamatkulov and Askarov; instead, it is a sustained and well-founded attack on a State Security Court system that will try him in breach of one of the most fundamental norms of international criminal justice, the prohibition on the use of evidence obtained by torture.

'Concrete and compelling evidence'. 'Sustained and well founded'. Not 'some worry'.

&gt; British national security was put in to jeopardy as a result.

Until he was deported after a guarantee that no torture would be used and no torture-sourced evidence would be used. Even your cause célèbre is shitty, because **in the end, he was deported convicted, and jailed**. So what's the fucking problem?

* 50% of votes in the election (22m) went to losing candidates, while 74% of votes (15m) were ‘wasted’ – i.e. they didn't contribute to electing the MP
* 2.8m voters were likely to have voted ‘tactically’ – over 9% of voters
* Under a more proportional voting system – the Single Transferable Vote – the Conservatives would have won 276 seats to Labour’s 236, while the SNP would have secured 34, UKIP 54 and the Lib Dems 26. The Greens would have won two more seats – in Bristol and London
* The ERS was able to call the winner correctly in 363 of 368 seats - a month before polling day - due to the prevalence of ‘safe seats’ under First Past the Post
* This election saw an MP win on the lowest vote share in electoral history – 24.5% in South Belfast
* 331 of 650 MPs were elected on under 50% of the vote, and 191 with less than 30% of the electorate.

I'm not convinced by their definition of the word 'wasted' in the first bullet point but aside from that I think they make some extremely good points.

It'd be really good if the smaller parties could collectively agree on STV as a system and twist the arms of the big guns in a future hung parliament scenario.

null,false,RushsMustache,lfc93,,null,"I feel that this season was a real opportunity to solidify a foothold on long term top four status, and destabilise the dominance of a top four rival at the same time.

Had Liverpool managed to beat United to a top four spot, and in doing so maintain some of the momentum from last season, they would have potentially strengthened their position in terms of player acquisition and retention while simultaneously weakening United's position. After this season, United are now in a strong position to make the acquisitions required to be considered serious title contenders next season.

United have a considerable kit deal that would be reduced substantially had they failed to achieve CL qualification for two consecutive years. The kit deal represents only a small portion of their gigantic revenue stream but Liverpool had to find ways of closing the financial gap between them and their rivals, however small. Keeping United out of Europe for two seasons could have been a start.

Next season will see considerable increases to revenue earned from CL, with [around 50%](http://www.totalsportek.com/money/uefa-champions-league-prize-money/) extra earned in CL group game participation fees, and the possibility of extra income for qualification into the knockout stages. Next season will also see an increase in money earned from the improved [TV rights deals](http://www.totalsportek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Premier-League-TV-rights-money-distribution-final-infograph.jpg) and, although the difference is less substantial, every little helps. 

This means that teams in the top four will be making a noticeably larger amount than the teams below them from next season onwards. 

These are the types of opportunities that the FSG model had to exploit in order to prevail and, with the potential of relaxed FFP rules, represents a huge opportunity squandered. 

While we are not going to become a mid-table side as you describe, i.e. Europa qualification challengers, it will likely be years before conditions such as last season and the summer following it are witnessed again. In that time Liverpool are more than likely to drift further afield from the top four financially and competitively.

""'A ticking time bomb': Teenage girls' junk food diet leaves them starved of vitamins""

In this title, allitaration ""**t**icking **t**ime **t**eenage"".

It's hyperbole (Exaggeration that isn't meant to be taken seriously) because they aren't literally starved of vitamins or else they would die.

It's also got emotive language ""starved"" - you wouldn't want your child to starve so it will make the reader more likely to want to see how to stop their child starving.

The title has a colon, this causes the reader to pause, it adds emphasis to the title and the risk associated with the diet of these teenagers.

----------------

The image has a girl eating a huge burger. Look for subtleties in the image.

The girl has her eyes closed, which could signify her ignorance to the lack of nutritional value and the damage it is causing.

Her hands need to stretch to hold the huge burger, which makes the reader wonder how the teenager is being starved - referring back to the text which says ""low in key vitamins and minerals""

&gt; If you cannot fill an ISA within a single year, I would add to the gap instead. You may as well try increase your income in the present rather than lock away money for the future.

You said:

&gt; Nothing whatsoever prevents you pulling income out of an ISA if that's what you want to do. And investing is absolutely about locking money away for the future.

You did not reply to the 'increasing your income in the present' and replied to 'locking money away for the future'. You implied that I meant that investing was not locking money away for the future, whereas I intended to see the ISA as a one way accumulating investment. You should only add money to an ISA and then de-accumulate when you are retiring.

If you are on a low income and you cannot fill an ISA, then I would advocate increasing your income. On a lower income, you can less afford the 'locking away money' as it could prove costly. For example, if you were forced to sell investments inside your ISA and then use up the allowance on the way out to pay for a a car repair or a bill for example. Outside your ISA in unwrapped investments includes things like emergency funds and high interest current accounts. They would give you flexibility.

On a low income, chance are you are not going to hit any allowance limits. You could buy some investment trust _outside_ the ISA and collect the dividends tax free. You could then sell without -fees- taxes*. Your trading costs would be the same (regular investment) but you could save on the platform fees. You still wouldn't lose any benefits of the ISA and would not use any of your ISA allowance.

&gt; How could you argue the UK has been a waste of money? There is literally no economic basis or facts you can bring up that prove that

That was my point. I was arguing that you *can't* argue that leaving and rejoining the union would be a waste of money, just as you can't argue that being independent and joining the union has been a waste of money.

&gt; Don't pretend the 6 million people in Scotland would have had anywhere near the success they do now without being buffered and bailed out by the English.

Don't be so naïve and condescending. Why would Scotland be any different than Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Iceland, or Denmark? Scotland is not dependant on England, fortunately. You're taking this incredibly personally, which is what I've come to expect from discussing the issue with many English people. This is political, not personal. ""You"" haven't bailed ""me"" out at all, and this air of superiority you have in this discussion wreaks of that attitude.

Scotland is as viable a country as Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, and I can't take any scare stories from you or ""international economists"" seriously. Yes, there would be teething problems. I accept that. But let's be real here, what's so unique about Scotland that would make it an anomalous unsuccessful western European country? It's a bizarre assertion with no basis in reality. The UK isn't the only country in the world, and it's certainly not the most successful.

&gt; What happens when you go independent? Will you blame someone else for your problems then?

No, we'd be a regular country and blame our own politicians for our mistakes. It's not a difficult concept, but you need to not take this rejection of the British state as a personal rejection.

This is in reverse order (newest at the top) - as you can see, we went from being a team in the champions league to a team that struggle to challenge for the top 4 (in the last 6 years we've finished above 6th once).

In the last 5 years we have been a mid-table team. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves. We've had one amazing season where we were truly amazing. 

But all is not sad, I do think we have a great foundation to build up from here. Our team now is a lot stronger than previous years. We were at times within touching distance of 4th place. We DO need to improve. We DO need to buy properly and strengthen better than anyone around.

And I believe you're wrong.  The future is unknowable, but using an ISA gets you potential upside at no cost.  It's like a free lottery ticket.  Why wouldn't you take it, however small the odds of winning?

&gt; Evidently, I have a bias for income generating assets and the flexibility of immediate access to funds. 

You can hold income generating assets inside an ISA and withdraw funds rapidly if you need to.  And true emergency funds, which is what you're likely to need fast access to, should be held in cash anyway.

&gt; With an ISA, if I want to add money and withdraw in parallel, I would deplete my allowance quickly.

Why would you plan to invest and withdraw at the same time?  Money's money - if you know you need money now or in the next few months you hold it in cash rather than investing it.  If something unexpected comes up and you have to pull money out of the ISA then that's a shame but you're no worse off than had the funds not been in the ISA, and if something unexpected *doesn't* come up you have the potential benefits of the ISA at no cost.

Also if the ISA reforms outlined in March are delivered then investing and withdrawing in parallel will not deplete the allowance (although I wouldn't advocate relying on promised future reforms when making current decisions).

Every member state gets to appoint one commissioner. The president of the commission is chosen in a similar fashion to a prime minister, i.e. the lead candidate of the largest European parliament group can try to form a majority. This time the centre-right EPP is the largest group, so their candidate (Juncker) became president. Since his colleagues are appointed by the member states, he doesn't get to choose his ministers the way a PM can, but he can tell them what job to do. They lead the rest of the EU's civil servants. Personally, I think it's pretty similar to how any normal country would be run, but obviously not identical.

Anyway, the commission's job is to enforce the EU treaties and propose new legislation. In fact, they are the only ones able to do so. Once a proposal has been submitted, both council and parliament can amend and change it as they wish.

null,false,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,null,"Hi,

&gt; Companies will be far more inclined to stock regulated goods very quickly if non-regulated goods cause PR backlash which you would think they would go.

You seem to be assuming that regulated goods have non-regulated equivalents. While this is true in some markets - for example the deoderant market in India contains both multinationals like Unilever and Indian-own companies. India has lax regulation on this market, so the Indian-own-brand deoderant is apparently often very explosive, wheras Unilever due to economies of scale will only create one deoderant that then has to be up to EU standards. So there's a regulated and deregulated equivalent, in a sense.

But medicines certainly won't be like that. There'll be a drug that does X, and it'll either be regulated or non-regulated. Consumers only have the choice of whether to take it or not to take it.

It is then impossible to know the risks, as the risks will not have been identified through trials. Therefore the consumer has only blind luck to guide him on a cost/benefit analysis.

Similarly, because the consumer has no choice, companies have no incentive to get their medicine regulated/certified. This is exactly why we have regulation.

You also have to think about the law of unintended consequences and of implicit or explicit state backing. Consider asbestos a good example! Could consumers have guessed it would give them cancer? no! would they have made a different choice if they had known? probably!

&gt; If a good will kill you within a week of consuming it then you might argue that it's the government duty to LET PEOPLE KNOW, but to stop people from taking it is a completely different argument.

And that's exactly what reguation does. It stops sale *until the unknowns are known*.

I'm simply saying that /u/ironsjack's reading of the current law is unfair and twisted to agree with his argument. The Sexual Offences Act has provisions for both offences, and it's written ""he"" due to a long-standing legal convention of using singular 'he' to refer to all people. This is shown by the fact that it starts ""a person is..."" then uses the pronoun to refer back to *a person*, not men in particular.

Look at the [Disqualifications Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/42/section/2): 

&gt; ""No person may...if **he** is the holder of a disqualifying office"".

Does this mean any woman sitting in the Irish Parliament is still uneligible to take up a seat in the House of Commons? Of course it doesn't. 

They are starting to change this tendency, look at the [Modern Slavery Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/part/1/crossheading/offences/enacted). 

&gt;A person commits an offence under this section if the person commits any offence with the intention of committing an offence

His argument that rape law applies only to men is untrue. I argued that it applies to anyone with a penis. 

My argument is that there is already a well-established offence for women who, in his words, rape men, and so therefore whining that male rape isn't taken as seriously in the courts is untrue  - as you can see in the cases I cited up above - and twisting the law and playing dumb about using ""he"" to mean ""they"" as an archaism of legal writing that is disappearing anyway is totally disingenuous.",null,0,null,1433173737,null,0,false,0,crrx9lm,null,t3_381y79,null,t1_crrx9lm,null,t1_crrw9kx,null,null,null,1436637625,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Large amounts of wealthy people in a country doesn't necessarily mean the country has done well, many of those places are tax havens, many of those places didn't have to recover from poverty. All of those countries are either heavily rich in national resources, tax heavens or gifted money from other countries for political reasons. The small populations are not the reason the living standards are high, but they exaggerate the numbers. Don't pretend Scotland is like them.

Of course you cannot argue against something that hasn't happened, that's what predictions are for, that's how the entire basis of stock markets works. That is how economics works. 

Don't accuse me of being naive in a hypocritical manor. Scotland is VERY different to those countries, it doesn't have it's own large industries or global franchise to match them, it doesn't have anywhere near their natural resources, it doesn't get a free pass into the EU. Scotland has an old and aging population which puts an even larger strain on their economy in the next 50 years, how can a small working force pay for a large amount of elderly people on top of the young people? All the while somehow putting extra money into welfare AND bumping up banks, AND affording to pump extra oil out of the sea,  AND completing all of their promises to improve the country's aging infrastructure. I understand you love Scotland, but don't pretend it is ANYWHERE near as viable as those counties for independence, that is simply a blind man leading the crippled. Those are not 'scare' stories, they are hard truths, and it's about time you realized you are not Sweden, you are not Denmark, you are not New Zealand. I'd love to pretend England is somehow super rich in resources and foreign aid like the United Arab Emirates, but it's not, and saying that doesn't make it true. I could say the UK as a whole is some beautiful nation like Australia, with golden beaches as far as the eye can see, but it's not, and once again just saying it doesn't make it true. It would be fantastic if the UK had industries like Germany, or businesses on the scale of the US. It does not.

You're right, I am passionate, I have a love of the country because I can look past ignorant delusions of grandeur. The UK can do SO much better, there is no denying that. I don't ""take it personally""  but I am frustrated when I read the large amount of Scottish people online who spout untruths and bend facts to suit themselves. You give figures which mean nothing to Scotland. 

The 'air of superiority' is 53 million people having a bigger say than 6 million people. I don't feel better than you, I would never claim to be better than anyone, but debating this with Scots is like talking to a brick wall. Ever been frustrated talking to a religious person because they argue in circles and prefer fairy tales to proven scientific theory? That's how this feels.

Stories like this girls are going to be even more common though most of them will be people who have to suffer in silence, many already are as the DWP has to meet its absurd targets at the expense of already suffering people's well-being.

Info for people who don't know how DLA works, PIP is pretty similar but harsher.

DLA is/was split into two parts, care and mobility, care had three tiers (low, middle, high rate) and mobility had two (low and high rate). To qualify for the car (Motability) you need high rate mobility, now this car isn't an extra benefit like a lot of people think, the cost is taken from your high rate directly, the car is an option so you can decline to apply for one and keep the money instead.

It seems to me she has filled out the new PIP assessment, and has now lost her enhanced rate mobility from being too optimistic in stating her abilities, which means she no longer is eligible for the Motability scheme.

If she can't get it back from this media exposure she can look forward to months of worthless appeals, a tribunal where you sit in front of three doctors across a table and are grilled on every little detail of your life, and if that fails they might deign to send out a doctor to her home to assess her in person.

i think players who will have their ""breakout seasons"" with us, meaning they will play much better than they did this season and exceed expectations, are going to be: 

1. markovich
2. ibe 
3. moreno 
4. lallana 
5. manquillo (if he's not recalled) 
6. brannagan
7. origi, to the surprise of many

these are all guys that i think will run through a brick wall for the squad and will play great. now with a summer of rest for lallana (no more injuries) and a full preseason for the rest of the squad (because remember, not all of these guys got a full preseason in with us), this squad will overachieve to the expectation of the fan base. whether we make top 4 or not, i have no clue, but this squad will exceed expectations next season and will have a great shot at top 4. 

I think signings of ings and milner will be a great start to what we need, and if we can add another cm and striker, we might be pretty complete. we'll see how the summer shapes up, very interested to see development of rodgers situation and also inbounds/outbounds. the team could undergo a very serious makeover, but one that will see us paying performing players and add players who we hope can perform.

Why?

What? Taking money out of an ISA doesn't use up any of the allowance.  

&gt; Outside your ISA in unwrapped investments includes things like emergency funds and high interest current accounts. They would give you flexibility.

What? That's apples and oranges.  Saving and investing aren't synonyms.

null,false,RMcD94,eu,"North Ayrshire, Scotland, United Kingdom, European Union, Earth",null,"&gt;But medicines certainly won't be like that. There'll be a drug that does X, and it'll either be regulated or non-regulated. Consumers only have the choice of whether to take it or not to take it.

In many scenarios regarding medicine customers would be happier to try a drug than die without. Obviously not a 100% of the time but it's something present in markets that aren't around.

I don't see why you couldn't have regulated medicine and unregulated medicine. If consumers are informed as you suggest then they should prefer medicine that doesn't kill them. 

Also, how do you sell ""medicine"" if you can't guarantee it will fix the problem? You must at least know it fixes the problem which should reasonably give some idea of the immediate side effects of said products.

&gt;It is then impossible to know the risks, as the risks will not have been identified through trials. Therefore the consumer has only blind luck to guide him on a cost/benefit analysis.

Then the customer should choose not to take a drug that might kill them. Again, as long as they're aware that the drug could kill them then it's their consumer choice.

&gt;Similarly, because the consumer has no choice, companies have no incentive to get their medicine regulated/certified. This is exactly why we have regulation.

The companies incentive will be consumers. I don't understand your argument here. The only way you could make this is if companies had a monopoly on medicine which isn't the case. 

Consumers should desire regulated products if non-regulated products are bad for them. 

&gt;And that's exactly what reguation does. It stops sale until the unknowns are known

That's just not true at all, the drugs being banned here have KNOWN psychoactive reaction. They're being banned because of the reaction they cause, and indeed all future products are being banned unless you can show they don't have known psychoactive reactions.

It's not ""show 10 years of consumption of the products in a population in a diverse population that contains at least X, Y, Z then label percentage of side effects that develop"" which would be a fair regulation which wouldn't limit consumer choice except for the 10 year delay (consumers after 10 years would have access to everything for example one drug would be ""Side Effect: Death 100% within 5 years).",null,0,null,1433174598,null,0,false,0,crrxs54,null,t3_37znq4,null,t1_crrxs54,null,t1_crrx6kh,null,null,null,1436638082,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

It's being an active member of society - or a socialist or communist, having beliefs that are separate from spiritual beliefs.

You do bring up a very good point about a contributing issue to the problem though - a lot of people self-diagnosing or using the terms colloquially has really muddles the whole issue - it frustrates me to no end to try to discuss with someone the depressive state I faced the week before, only to have them say 'ya, I've been pretty depressed lately too' referring to them simply feeling down about life. They had no issue getting out of bed; they had no issue caring for themselves and going about their day, but they feel brought down by something in life and associate that with the condition of depression, because they dont actually understand what it really means to be depressed.

So rather than go into specialist training they do this. 

The NHS is trying to hire less doctors to do more work because of targets but they waste discretionary money on Locums. The simplest fix would be to improve salaries across the board but everyone goes ""NURSE PRACTITIONERS EARN 55,000 Pounds!"" and ""CONSULTANTS EARN 120,000 pounds!"" and no one realises that there aren't that many of them at that highest level. 

We can make the NHS more efficient. We can make savings through efficiency. What efficiency has meant for most though has been fewer doctors doing more work rather than the work being smarter.

I know I've mentioned a lot of players but these are the most influential players at their clubs who also stand-out in the league.

For Champions league, Celtic will start off in 1st or 2nd round qualifying (I can't remember tbh) and will have to play around 3 two leggeed ties to make it to the group stage, and they should be able to do it rather easily.

For Europa league, St Johnstone and Aberdeen will start off in the 1st round and will have to play 3/4 two legged ties to make it to the group stage (Aberdeen has an okay chance and St Johnstone will be a tough opponent). Inverness will start in the second leg and play 2/3 ties (cant remember) to make it into the group stage (if they can keep enough players they may make it but a very slim chance.

&gt;All three rulings uphold earlier judgments in HMRC’s favour at the First-tier Tribunal.

&gt;The Upper Tribunal dismissed an appeal brought by users of a scheme that sought to create artificial losses by using a combination of the employment Income and Capital Gains Tax rules on share options. The judges dismissed the appeal without needing to hear substantive arguments from HMRC, and indicated that written reasons would follow. There were 420 users of this scheme.

&gt;The Upper Tribunal also dismissed two other cases. These bespoke schemes were designed by banks to provide the users with a much higher tax-free return on their cash deposits than they could have obtained by placing funds in a normal deposit account. Both of these schemes were marketed and sold by banks some years ago for substantial fees. The court joined these two separate cases because of similarities between the schemes.

&gt;The __American Revolutionary War__ (1775–1783), the __American War of Independence__,  or simply the __Revolutionary War__ in the United States, was the armed conflict between the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain) and [thirteen of its former North American colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies), which had declared themselves the independent [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America).   Early fighting took place primarily on the North American continent. In 1778 France, eager for revenge after its defeat in 1763, signed an [alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-American_alliance) with the new nation. The conflict then escalated into a [world war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war) with Britain combating [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_France), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Spain), and [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic). Contemporaneous [fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Mysore_War) also broke out in India between the British [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) and the French allied [Kingdom of Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mysore).

null,false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,null,"&gt; I know my anecdote does not reflect all sex workers but I don't think the amount of sex workers who are victims is enough of a minority in the market to not warrent protecting them from aggressors.

Criminalising sex work just puts them at more risk though - if it was an open trade like any other, customers could be vetted, workers could work from licensed legal buildings, regular sexual health check ups and/or mental health check ups could be enforced, abusive 'management' of sex workers could be fought against more effectively etc etc, because it's all out in the open. All this is doing is pushing it even further into the shadows of society, and when you go into the shadows who knows who you'll meet.

&gt; It's just one example but I think we should have state security operations where we actually go after the bad cunts in society and those who support them. While giving support victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking.

There should of course be a battle against human traffickers - but with legalising some brothels here and there you're giving legal trade to something that can be effectively overseen - whereas by criminalising it you're giving a monopoly on the trade to those specifically with money on their mind and everything else (like the well being and healthcare of their sex workers) secondary. Legalising it takes away incentive for the traffickers (due to a more saturated market) and takes away the necessity of relying on illicit unlicensed sex workers from the customers. It's a win-win.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"&gt;The first-past-the-post system has three main advantages. First, it is very simple for the voter – who chooses one and only one candidate from a pre-established list – and for the organizations who count the votes. The results are known quickly, often a few hours after the polls are closed. Second, this system ensures a tight connection between the MP and his or her voters. Each riding is represented explicitly by one MP, who can therefore act as an ambassador at the national level. In some cases, elected officials can also have more independence vis-à-vis party officials than with other voting systems since (1) candidates are chosen by members of the constituency and (2) the local election confers greater legitimacy to those MPs who benefit from the personal support of voters. Third, our current voting system usually produces stable majority governments due to the frequent discrepancy between the percentage of votes and the percentage of seats. For some, this is a considerable advantage, since it is often said that a majority government is more “efficient” in terms of implementing its political program. Stability can also be seen as an advantage, since this implies fewer elections and allows government parties to focus on the longer term.

So let's not pretend like it was a random choice and FSG isn't calculated in what they are doing.  They don't just fire a manager because they don't like him or ""the fans want him out."" They fire a manager because of terrible performances with no look of improvement. 

Brendan Rodgers not only shows that he has the skills as a manager to coach beautiful and exciting football but he also shows that he can change tactics and progress as a manager. Yes, we got 6th but once we were out of CL running it was all over. We also had 0 in form strikers this season and we were forced to play an aging player who wasn't quite cut out for the season.

null,false,Skavau,null,null,null,"&gt;This morning the Electoral Reform Society – those alcoholics of constitutional renewal – are back at the bar for one more (and only one more, you understand) late-night chaser. The last election was the “most disproportionate in British history”. Yes, they may have said that at the previous election. And the one before that. But this time they really, really mean it. 

Dan Hodges is an idiot. Does he not grasp the concept that with the increasing rise of smaller parties that each election is probably increasingly *less* representative?

I don't know whether or not the ERS said that last time but this time it certainly is true. 7 Million+ voters left with just 10 seats speaks to that.

&gt; The current electoral system is “archaic” and “divisive”. Yes, it may be the same electoral system the British people voted to retain in 2011. But listen, just listen a minute will you? That was back then. And things have changed. 

Yes, things have changed and the British people voted to retain it due to a poor and inept alternative in the form of the Alternative Vote System. Why do the media keep lying that the British public rejected PR or a form of PR?

&gt;You think ERS is the one with the problem? Well aren’t you all high and mighty. Why don’t you take a look at yourselves. You’re the one with the problem. Everyone’s started “shopping around”, they're “supporting a wider range of parties than ever before”, “the system's really struggling to cope”. 

It is. That's the point and the problem.

&gt;The first thing to do is make them face up squarely to their past behaviour. Four years ago we had a referendum on electoral reform. The electoral reformers told us this was the chance to say “Yes to fairer votes”. In fact, it wasn’t just a chance, but a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the way we do politics in the UK”. So off we went to the polling stations, and we voted on it. Six million people (32 per cent) voted to change the system. 13 million (68 per cent) voted to keep it. 

You're a credulous idiot or a cynical bugger if you honestly think that the sum total of what the ERS wanted was Alternative Vote.

&gt;This morning the ERS has kindly produced an assessment of what last month’s election result would have looked like under that AV system. The Conservatives would actually have had an additional 6 seats, (337), Labour would have had 5 fewer (227), the SNP 2 less (54), and the Lib Dems an extra 1 (9). Seat allocations for the other parties would have remained the same. A big difference? Oh yes. That result would certainly have been one in the eye for the old political establishment. 

This pathetic yellow journalism is just embarrassing.

Who is calling for AV? 

&gt; Before the election we were told by the ERS “the two party system is dead”. On 7 May the percentage of votes cast for the two main parties increased. 

Because of the capitulation of the Liberal Democrats and the vote share of the Conservatives and Labour only increased marginally. A trend I suspect that will not continue in 2020 *unless* UKIP shed votes then, which is possible but I suspect the Liberal Democrats may recover then somewhat.

UKIP's vote skyrocketed and the Greens increased not insubstantially.

&gt;On 24 March the ERS said: “People’s wishes have changed. They want to see multiple parties competing for their votes, and then working together when they get to Westminster. That means coalition and minority government are likely to become the norm."" On the 6 May they doubled down, claiming: “What we’ve seen in this election period is the two main parties pursuing the fantasy of a majority, instead of dealing with the reality that they should work with other parties”. 24 hours later, the Conservatives secured a majority. 

By a small margin thanks primarily to the folding of the Liberal Democrats. They didn't win any good faith across the board.

&gt;So the practical result of a change of electoral system would be that, under any of the options, David Cameron would still be prime minister. The only difference is that under two of them he would be serving at the whim of Nigel Farage. 

That's not the point and never has been the point. Electoral Reform advisers should not be interested in who wins under certain systems but if they're fair and representative. They shouldn't dismiss an idea because it might result in a result they do not like.

&gt; There is a reason that four years ago the British people made the decision in overwhelming numbers to retain our current electoral system. It works, and they recognise it works. 

No, because they were sold a limp alternative, flooded with negative campaigning against it. They kept FPTP because AV did almost nothing to solve the issues with FPTP.

&gt; The second is to provide stable government. And again, it has done. Indeed, the British people used the voting system to turn their backs on the very coalition scenarios the electoral reformers insisted were an inevitable outcome of the election. 

If you're so interested in ""stable government"" and regard that as the sole priority then why do you even support democracy at all? Why do not endorse a technocracy or a plutocracy?

&gt;The third is the current system guarantees moderate government. Extreme or fringe parties like Ukip or the Greens or the Liberal Democrats have to pass a high electoral threshold to be in a position to get their hands on the levers of government. They may not like it. The electoral reformers may not like it. But the British people value this padlock on extremism and superficiality. 

So really, you concede that this all about keeping out parties you don't like by specifically prejudicing the system against them.

&gt; The current system is broken because it can’t deal with coalitions. No, hang, on forget that. It’s broken because it didn’t deliver a coalition. No wait, wait, it’ll come to me. PR’s good because it will lock in a progressive consensus. Oi, don’t tug at me pal. What I mean is it’s good because it will give Nigel Farage another 80 seats. Solid man Nigel – always stands his round. Oh come on. You haven’t even rung the bell yet. First past the post is bad because it penalises small parties like the SNP. Oops. I mean first past the post is bad because it gives parties like the SNP too much power. Hey, what are you doing? Listen to me, I’m telling you, THEY’RE GOING TO BREAK UP BRITAIN!!! All right. All right. Just let me call a cab first …

We speak it more than we do English, and it's part of who we are. And honestly, I've seen quite a few overreactions from non-Welsh speaking people about teaching the language. I've heard it said quite a few times that teaching kids Welsh and English at a young age would only slow things down and that they'd end up with a lesser command for either language, but that's simply not true. Every Welsh speaker learned two languages at the same time growing up, and we're alright. Poorer than the south, but alright.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. I'm sorry if I offended, if I did I didn't mean to. Just thinking aybe a change like that would help. Again, probably a stupid idea, just throwing it out there.

 You share a connection with everyone in the street, and therefore your modem is identified by its MAC. You could plug your modem in your neighbour's house and it would still work (and anything you do through it would be linked to you, not them)

The bit that is wrong is that Virgin doesn't let you use your own router. They do, but it has to be connected to the back of their own router (with built in modem), and you turn ""modem mode"" on so that it acts like a plain modem.

I think it's more to do with being a BT customer than broadcasting wifi. You can use your own router (which means that you aren't broadcasting a public wifi network) and you can still connect to anyone else's.

I think it's useful. I've been in positions where I could use the ""free"" BT wifi, free wifi at the place I was in, 3G tethering etc. BT WiFi was the fastest and lowest latency compared to the others.

My personal preference would be to have an overarching offence such as Section 4 which covered almost all penetrative sexual offences (rape, assault by penetration, causing to engage) with sentencing guidelines set out and regularly revised by the Sentencing Council.

Durham is a very small city, during holiday time I live in a town that's bigger. This means it's very easy to traverse (just walk, or maybe take the bus depending). It is also pretty safe. I would (and do) feel comfortable walking around at 6pm (in the summer it will still be light!), but obviously, use your common sense as well (ie. don't go down dark alleyways etc.)

Are you doing your course with Durham uni, and if so, I'm guessing you're staying at one of the colleges?

Unless you're living in the Gilesgate area or have access to a car (I noticed you said you're travelling a lot), you will probably find 'big tesco' (tesco extra) a bit of a pain to get to. There's a tesco metro in Market Square in town, and a tesco express and a sainsburys local (and a couple of other similar) on North Road.

There's a market in the square every Saturday. I would recomend having a look if you can to see some local stuff. Also, visiting the cathedral is a must! If you like a certain franchise of films, you may find bits familiar. There's a [museum](http://www.durhamheritagecentre.org.uk/) near the cathedral I've never been to, and another one about world heritage sites on the street leading up to it. Free to wander in to that one. There's also an [oriental museum](https://www.dur.ac.uk/oriental.museum/) which you might be able to get into free if you're with durham uni, normal students do. Also parts of the uni students can get into free are the [palace green library](https://www.dur.ac.uk/palace.green/) and [botanic gardens](https://www.dur.ac.uk/botanic.garden/).

There are a couple of waterstones (bookshop) in durham, one more academicy than the other. There's the [gala theatre](http://www.galadurham.co.uk/index.php), but because it will be the summer, I highly doubt there will be any student productions going on at any other venues.

A note on some comments in the other thread; there is no cineworld in Durham. While unlimited films for £15 is a fairly good deal, all there is in Durham is the cinema at the Gala theatre. Also, putting money on the counter rather than in people's hand isn't a thing. I don't know where they got it from.

All studies show that being bilingual makes it *much* easier to learn other languages. It's not the case that learning to speak Welsh will come at the expense of learning other languages, quite the opposite, and you have the built in advantage of lots of fluent Welsh speakers and teachers, and opportunities to practice in the real world, and to learn from a very young age. That isn't true of Mandarin. The reality is, you are probably choosing between being bilingual and being monoglot, like most of Britain.

I also think preserving and valuing culture is just important. But even if it's just a question of economics, if Wales sheds all of its distinctiveness, in pursuit of an English education, it will do nothing to help the Welsh economy either. Tourism should be a much bigger industry for Wales than it is, and valuing local culture is absolutely crucial to that.

I wish other Brits had had my experience of living and working with  other Europeans and stopped being so ""little Britain"". You can see that the world is forming itself into a small number of big political and economic blocks and as a Brit you really only have three choices: pursue the unrealistic idea of an independent Britain and perish (there is no doubt of that - we do not have the economic weight to go it alone) strengthen our ties with Europe (definitely the best option) or risk becoming America's 51st state (this is already almost true).

When I look at the cultural aspects of my life I find far more alliances with Europe than the US. I like European food (beers, wines and cheeses especially) and cant think of a single product from the US that is part of my diet. I love European music (from Bach to Rammstein), films (von tier and Almodóvar are the best directors in the world, French and English cinema trumps anything Hollywood has to offer despite them having obscene budgets). I love European writers and find I share their world view way more than Hemingway, Fitzgerald or Steinbeck. As for TV - I just wish that here in the UK we got to see more Europe-produced stuff and less American crap: the germans do great documentaries, the french great arts programmes and the scandinavians brilliant dramas.

Politically? I admit Europe isnt perfect but hey, the US started with a clean sheet and still manged to end up with a top heavy, corrupt, inefficient, unfair and unrepresentative system.

It isn't; because we semantically exclude it. Could you explain to me why it is that there is value in the distinction then? Since you seem keen to defend the status quo. 


As you say this could be very easily remedied by simply abolishing S1 and applying the S4 standards to all cases of rape, M-&gt;F, M-&gt;M, F-&gt;M, F-&gt;F. It is equally applicable to all. 


If the meaning and power of the word ""Rape/Rapist"" isnt significant enough to be worth making equal between men and women, then presumably you should have by the same token no issue with removing it from the legal vocabulary entirely. Making no man a rapist, simply a convicted sex offender under S4.


S4 is not in the least bit ambiguous. Evidentially cases may be hard to bring, but no more so than under S1! If you can find me an actual legit reason why it is that S1 continues to exist, other than ""We want to be able to use a nastier word against male offenders because they are worse somehow"", i'll eat my hat. 


&gt;Your argument boils down to ""I should be able to call women who commit the lay definition of rape, rapists""


FTFY bro, surely that's what you meant to say, rather than trying to imply that he wants to be able to call all women rapists, which is what you said. Cos you would never be so intellectually dishonest, would ya? :D 

&gt;But the fixed, historic definition of rape is that it is an active, penetrative act.


The fixed, historic definition of marriage is that it involves a contractual obligation to carry out wifely duties, therefore a man cannot possibly rape his wife due to implicit consent. See how historical definitions don't mean shit once they have become anachronistic, and need to be changed and updated to reflect modern values. 


&gt;Just as there is a distinction between murder and manslaughter, which can carry the same punishments, even though they are intrinsically the same act from different perspectives.


Umm... That is just so far from appropriate that i don't know where to begin. The principle difference between the manslaughter offenses and murder (And there are MANY differences, but im going to keep it simple) is intent. The difference between S1 and S4 is NOT intent, its an arbitrary restriction on who can be charged under each section. Intent is indeed handled in the Sexual Offenses Act, but its so rarely a factor that its barely even considered. Unless you trip and fall into her pussy/onto his dick you're gonna struggle to demonstrate you didn't have intent. 


The distinction between murder and manslaughter is NECESSARY, CONSIDERED AND IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE

The distinction between S1 and S4 is an anachronistic and moronic throwback which serves noone other than misandrists and female supremacists.

Arguably, if the House was evenly split with a less than 5 seat majority for a right-wing government, SF could prop up a left-wing government, but even then it would be political suicide for any British party to do a deal with SF (we saw the fuss created over a potential Lab/SNP coalition), it's also uncertain whether a British government, especially a Labour one would interfere with the North and give up it's 'neutral actor' position it's held since the 70s, especially if it were to implement anything a nationalist party would want.

That's a totally pointless metric because the underlying causes of a recession can be completely different, and non-global recessions are also far easier to recover from. A lot of the graphs presented aren't using standard methods of economic analysis they're cherry picked from the worst looking data with specific manipulations made to prove a point. It's incredibly obvious they didn't set out to present an unbiased assesment of the recovery, they've set out with the specific intention of downplaying a Conservative role in economic recovery. You can't ignore the websites obvious agenda.

Secondly I don't think the PPP statistics you present are necessarily a fair comparison either. Why have you chosen those five countries as our competitors? How do I know you didn't have twenty countries and only chose the five that were better than us? 

It also doesn't take into account variances in our respective economies. Was 2007 Britain's economy on a steady linear rise or was it booming because of an economic bubble?

* Women of a ""ripe age"" are still young enough to also crave things like girly nights out, girly holidays, and so on.  Along with serious career setbacks, this also exits stage left if they find themselves lumbered with a crying, shitting, puking, financially draining ball and chain

* See above for men too

* Men don't want to commit because, quite frankly, we now live in a misandrist society with divorce and child custody laws that are antiquated and broken beyond all hope.  Who wants to sign up for that?  I don't!

I am happier here than anywhere else, and want nothing to do with the rest of Europe. I find their laws backwards (I was once fined for crossing a long straight road that had no cars in sight, either parked or driving), and was sued twice without ever leaving my house, for ridiculous reasons. On the second occasion, when I challenged their letter with my own, I never heard from them again, because it was an obvious scam. (I had apparently been receiving benefits money without having ever set up a bank account there)

And each to their own, but I do not like their languages. I was bad at Welsh in school and hated French and Spanish. It's not my thing, and I never managed to learn German. I was unable to have a conversation with a real human being who could speak half decent English in just over a year. When I came back, just listening to people in the street in the middle of the town center here was a joy. (I understood people again! Yay!)

In short, as stated, I want nothing to do with Europe, and will probably never leave this island again. I also somewhat dislike the northern main Euro countries (French border patrol at Calais was extremely rude, they don't like us very much. I also don't enjoy the average German sense of humour and obviously didn't like it there.)

So no, not only do I not like it geographically, I certainly don't identify with them. I know Britain is on the European continent, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. I also don't identify with them in a non geographic sense. Their morals do not appeal to me. I see European screwups in the news and all I can think about is how we should be ridding ourselves of them. They make us look bad, and from what I can tell they certainly do not appreciate us, especially after everything we have done for them throughout history. 

Although to be fair, I did have a laugh on the way back here with two Belgian police officers about the Germans. They asked why I was leaving, and I told them I was sick of potatoes and sausages. I am also quite fond of Sweden. But by no means do I feel like we are connected in any way.
I would like to be friends with Europe, but I do not see us as being one of them. I will vote to leave Europe in 2016, and I daresay so will many people. I don't see us staying after the referendum.

When you have a spare weekend sit down and have a think about what you can do with the money that gives you as much advantage as possible.

The main thing I would say is don't let this opportunity slip away. Its not often an 18 year old gets 60k. You can leverage this money to achieve a lot in the future. 

Main thing is though not to rush into anything. You may be at a point in your life where this money shouldn't or can't be used effectively and that's fine. Putting  as much as you can in an is a (cash or stocks and shares) is a good interim measure. Then once you know how you can best leverage the money (which may be in several years) you can use the money and have benefited from a bit of appreciation in the meantime.

Maybe look at the money again once you are in a steady job with a settled personal/home life.

When we live in a world where a man calling the police to report domestic violence is more likely to be arrested than she is? I mean fuck me its already common knowledge to anyone who cares to do some cursory reading that women get 40% shorter sentences just on virtue of being women. Not because of any difference in the offense, just literal out and out sexism. 

As for SOA03, im with you on the solution, abolish S1, rename S4 to rape and proceed with all penetrative (Or envelopment) sexual offenses under that section. Theres absolutely nothing a man could do to criminalise himself under S1 that he wouldnt also be liable for under S4, and the sentencing is the same. 

As for how rare such cases are, yes, it is telling, its telling that in a context where (as we have seen in studies linked earlier in the thread) women are commiting these acts at very comparable rates to that of conventional S1 rape, there have been so few cases as to leave many things untested. We have to ask ourselves very serious questions as to why that is. Because if the roles were reversed this would be a national scandal. 

As for his point specifically, i'll agree with you, he should not be implying (Though hes been very careful not to actually say) that there is no provision. There is indeed perfectly adequate provision in the statute, if you could actually report it without being arrested yourself, and if once you did that you managed to get the police not to laugh at you, and if once you did that you managed to get the CPS to consider the case worth persuing, yes, there is provision in the statute. And once/if it gets to court it will be prosecuted.

Indisputably Britain and America share a lot of the same history, legal system, literary heritage and so forth. We are, after all, forked from the same country. But we have also adapted to different conditions in the world. Their culture is more individualistic than us (though less than is stated. There's a reason it's called ""Anglo-American capitalism""), more aggressive (see their TV news) and also more diverse.

When a young, progressive metropolitan Briton looks at this I think the tendency is to be appalled (aside from the diversity bit), and therefore to conclude we are much more similar to our European neighbours. For conservatives I think the opposite is probably true. Though a radical country by design, the US is in many ways impressively conservative (see how religious it is).

I'd conclude the reality is we're somewhere in between these two poles. Britain as a whole doesn't buy into Eurofederalism, but nor do we really see a future outside the EU's sphere of influence. We have a stronger tradition of individual liberty than much of the continent, but we're also a lot more socialist than the Yanks. 

We also have not suffered under a dictatorship within living memory, nor do we fear the Russians in the way the continent does. Our outlook is by nature more global than, say, Germany, largely because of the imperial connections, but also because we're an island. In that respect, we are far more like the Yanks (who live on a *de facto* island without any enemies nearby), and our foreign policy has reflected that.

null,false,steampunkunicorn,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"&gt;We don't. The reality is that we spend tens of billions of pounds a year housing people because they can't afford to do it for themselves and a lot of that money is spent inefficiently.

And WHY can't they afford it? Because the system is stacked against them. There aren't enough houses, so the supply/demand relationship is skewed horrifically in favour of property owners who then get tax relief on buy to let mortgages, and no restrictions on how much they can jack up then rent.

The bedroom tax isn't about reducing inefficiency. It's about making the government look like they're doing something when in reality they're just making things worse for the poor. If they wanted to reduce inefficiency, they'd cut out all the crap you have to go through in order to claim, and streamline the whole process.

&gt;I can afford to buy a Porsche, that doesn't mean I should or that it would be an efficient use of my money.

An argument that applies to your finances cannot be applied to that of the NHS or fire services of an entire country.

&gt;This isn't communist Russia. We don't feed people. We give them a roof over their head and money in their pocket and they are free to spend it how they want.

Except we don't. May I bring your attention to the increasing use of food banks? Why are we in this situation? Why, when we're the 6th richest country in the world, do we still have hundreds of people who have to rely on charity in order to feed themselves? Something is BADLY wrong with our society.

&gt;Second of all, how should we make it more fair? 

As I said. Tax those who can afford it. End tax relief on buy to let mortgages for a start... put controls on rent so landlords can't stiff their tenants. Reform the banking and financial sectors. Increase regulation to prevent banks screwing up the economy again. Fine them for doing it in the first place. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage to stop the taxpayer subsidising employment costs. Reduce tuition fees - give everyone the chance of a decent education, not just those who can afford it.

What takes place is pretty much the same as what you'd expect in an English lesson in England, analysis of poetry, literature, creative writing etc. 

This is actually what we do in English lessons as well, at least for Welsh first language teaching, to an equal degree of complexity, which isn't a problem up north because we're brought up with both languages. This is why I've always found it a bit weird to refer to myself as someone who speaks English as a ""second language."" Technically, it's true but it's more like an honourary first language for me.

 From what I've heard (very reliable source, I know,) many people in non Welsh speaking areas resent this study of literature because they're pushed in at the deep end a little bit, where they should be focusing on the basics, similar to what you would learn in a French class for instance. Many of them seem to have some personal vendetta against the Welsh language existing, which is always fun.

I realise I've probably gone on another ramble, so I'll try answer your question. The Welsh language is taught in two different ways,  and it depends if it's your first language or not. Therefore, I suppose you could say it varies by school/region because there are areas where the vast majority of people speak Welsh as a primary language, therefore the language will be taught accordingly, that is to say to a level of complexity an Englishman would expect in an English lesson. This was certainly true in my secondary school, it consisted of some 1,000 pupils, and I'd say an easy 90% were educated in ""Welsh first language.""

However, the majority of the Welsh population does not speak Welsh as a first language, therefore it will be taught according to the ""Welsh second language"" method in the large population centres of the south. Once again, I'm no expert on politics, but as far as I know Plaid Cymru intend on ensuring Welsh's position as a mandatory subject. This entails giving it equal status with English, Science and Mathematics, in other words the core subjects you're not allowed to drop when you move up to Year 10 (GCSE). I hope that wall of text was somewhat helpful, thanks for your patience and I apologise for the late reply!

Why don't you try out, for a couple of weeks, some programming. Maybe try some basic HTML and JavaScript. Then maybe try some MVC. 

The internet is full of documentation and people willing to help you learn. And once you get ok at it you can maybe see if you can make something work related. Once you have you can then put it on your CV.

No, you are talking drivel. You obviously don't sound well versed on the topic, but in areas where high concentrated individuals live, the poor stay and the wealthier go.

Mixed class housing sounds nice - the more well off provide an air of sensibility to the area, while the poor have somewhere nice to live - but pretty soon after a generation the poor begin to ruin the place while the wealthy see this and move elsewhere, leaving only the poor. There are loads of case studies to back this up. South Central LA post World War 2 being just one example.

the Docklands is just one of a many London areas regenerated by private housing builds (Hackney, Colindale, Brixton to name a few more) on sites that were full of criminal activity. Having these houses mixed with poor and better off will not solve the issue.

The reason is because until the Moment came into the picture, fixed points in time weren't accessible or changeable. I found this to be very clear. And given the fact that the Moment has a conscience, I seriously doubt such an instance will ever happen again. Am I missing something?

&gt;It also requires the judiciary (including tribunals) to take account of any decisions, judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, and to interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. However, if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the Convention, the judges.. .. issue a declaration of incompatibility.

So, under the current system the British judiciary can place an obligation (if a somewhat ineffectual one) on parliament to change the law. Under the terms of the convention, an international obligation can be placed on the UK state as a whole (not parliament) to change the law. Effectively I can't see it making much difference other than removing these powers from the British courts, or at least altering them, whilst freeing them from an obligation to always 'interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights' - however, to the best of my knowledge, it would not prohibit them from doing so and they would probably continue to do so. **So basically the purpose of this** is to remove the incorporation of the ECHR into the actual legal system and reduce it to an international obligation upon the state once again.

EDIT: edited to make clear it would probably not remove the power of the British courts to declare a declaration of incompatibility altogether.

EDIT 2: Added a bit more stuff. And to be even more clear, because the purpose of the HRA is to incorporate the ECHR and the decisions of the ECtHR into national law, and the purpose of the new bill would be to establish the British courts as supreme on the subject of human rights, the concept of a 'declaration of incompatibility' would necessarily have to be changed, but I imagine a new function would be given to courts so they are able to place an obligation upon parliament.

BR and the committee need to bring in quality players at the ST, RB, CM positions and add some depth (if funds available) to replace the likely outgoing jose enrique and brad jones. 

no manager is going to walk in and make this team turn around completely because rodgers style is very unique. if we bring in klopp, we would need to bring in a lewandowski type striker, a gundogan type playmaker and probably add two wingbacks. this could likely take a few seasons. if what is being said is true, and someone like klopp is going to take a sabattical, i would like to continue on with rodgers. 

also your observation of ""no signs of any change after an atrocious season"" epitomizes everything wrong with modern football. ask yourself this, how many season did it take before SAF got into the top 4, let alone win the league? answer: he started in 1986 and won the league for the first time in 1993. He was afforded 7 years to build an entire program. How many years before klopp won his first league? Answer: klopp started in 2008 and was afforded until 2012 before winning his first league. How many years before Louis van gal won his first league? Answer: it took him 3 years to win a league, with ajax who at the time was a european powerhouse....the list goes on and on of great managers who needed, and were afforded, time to build their successes. im not saying BR is a great manager now, but i see a guy who is a winner and has had a very uphill task of trying to re-establish us in the top 4 in a financially very rich period of european football. we are not poor by any means, but we are not stupid rich like some of these teams are and he is building in a sustainable, sensible way for the most part. I am sure he had a hand in some of the signings, notably lovren and lallana, and yes they weren't great this year, but i have full faith (espescially in lallana) that those two have long term roles to play with us. 

anyways, i am fully supportive of people believe rodgers should ""be out""...your opinions are waht make my argument that much harder to justify, but BR has shown (even in this shitty season) that he has the capability to completely change the system and get the best out of the players he has available. Just ask yourself how many coaches have gone on a 13 match, premier league, unbeaten run...and the answer you'll find is not many. add on top of that, that he has done it two years running and an 8 match unbeaten in 2012-2013...

so anyways, while i think our performances were abysmal this season, i don't think the problems are so deep rooted a coaching change is necessary, only unless the right coach wants to step in. if that coach is klopp, we probably won't be able to sign him until next summer if his sabbatical is being taken seriously. 

so for me, rodgers in. ings, milner, another st, another cm and a rb would be where i would focus on my transfer inbounds, and give him a good crack at getting this right once and for all. the core of the team is locked up on contracts through 2017 (even raheem if we hold him ""ransom"") and if we add those 5 pieces over the summer, and they hit the ground running, then we have a legit chance at top 4, with an inventive manager who i have seen humbled by this season. 

so from a fellow red, thank you for YOUR candid opinions, but i respectfully disagree and think rodgers is our guy. If he is to go, so be it, but i would only be happy if it's a certain style of manager. Klopp or Emery being my top 2 choices.

&gt;

&gt;__Comté__ (also called __[Gruyère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8re_(cheese\)) de Comté__) (French pronunciation: ​[kɔ̃.te]) is a [French cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_cheeses) made from unpasteurized cow's milk in the [Franche-Comté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9) region of eastern [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). Comté has the highest production of all French [AOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d%27Origine_Contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e) cheeses, around 40,000 tonnes annually.

&gt;The cheese is made in flat circular discs, each between 40 cm (16 in) and 70 cm (28 in) in diameter, and around 10 cm (4 in) in height. Each disc weighs up to 50 kg (110 lb) with an [FDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_matter#FDM) around 45%. The rind is usually a dusty-brown colour, and the internal [pâte](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%C3%A2te) is a pale creamy yellow. The texture is relatively hard and flexible, and the taste is strong and slightly sweet.

---------

Cleaning your bike.

You don't need all the fancy products to do it. Seriously. All you really need is:

* Passable socket set (Halfords do a damn fine range of sets from £125 to £175) if you intend to remove parts to clean
* Petrol for removing filth
* Some rags to soak up filthy petrol and goo
* Some microfibre cloths
* Furniture polish
* Autosol for cleaning bare metal and chrome
* Silicone spray or preferably ProPrep (by Silkolene) to spruce up plastics
* Disposable gloves (optional , but recommended)
* A toothbrush
* Warm soapy water
* A dish brush
* Scotchbrite pads (the softer, green ones)
* Paint pens to touch-up marks
* Spray paint for larger areas
* Evo fine (grade 1) can be used to get stubborn dirt off of paint and bugs off of the headlight/s

First: Warnings
--

* Never use scotchbrite pads on painted surfaces
* Never leave silicone spray or oil-based products on tyres or grips. Wash off with petrol (applied to a rag) or other solvent before riding
* Never jet wash your bike in anything but a downward motion from a good distance - You could wet the electrics - Avoid jet-washing if you can
* ALWAYS read the instructions and usage guides
* Be sure to keep rags off the floor and free of grit. Beware scothbrite pads. They stick well to cloth and especially microfibre cloths.
* Be aware that if you clean areas which are normally lubricated (chain or hinges for example) you will need to re-apply the appropriate lubricant afterwards.

How to:
--

**Step 1: Cleaning**

* Petrol is great for removing heavy filth from areas like the chain, shock, suspension linkages and the chain side of the rear wheel where dried filth sits. Rinse off with water and then wipe with a rag. 
* Use a toothbrush to work the above areas
* A tub of petrol can be used to soak items. Be sure to properly dispose of dirty petrol and wipe up any spillages. Brake/carb cleaner can be used to do this, or even washing powder.
* Autosol is for bare metal and chrome only. Apply to a rag or microfibre cloth and work it in circles. Allow to dry and then wipe away with the same rag or cloth to shine.
* More seriously dirty or rusted bare metal areas can be tackled with scotchbrite pads or wirewool. But BE CAREFUL as they can and will leave marks if you apply too much pressure.
* When cleaning paintwork; Just use warm soapy water and a clean cloth to remove dirt, dry, then apply furniture polish and wipe off with a clean cloth, preferably a microfibre cloth. Be gentle.
* Furniture polish is also good for cleaning and restoring rubber, such as; Grips, footpegs and the seat as it's far less slippery than silicone or similar products.
* If you have seriously faded plastics, apply a generous coating of proprep, leave it for at least 10 mins, then wipe off with a cloth, then re-apply a fine coat. Do not wipe the fine coat off.
* be careful not to get oily products on to brake pads.

**Step 2: Restoration**

* Exhaust pipes can be cleaned with either wirewool, or scotchbrite pads and Autosol.
* Avoid removing bolts from the exhaust system if you can. A stripped bolt or snapped head can be amazingly expensive and risky to remove from the engine block.
* Bolts can be cleaned of rust and that white fuzz with wirewool or scotchbrite pads
* if you need to paint, make sure you use plenty of cloths to protect areas you don't want to paint. Also use masking tape to secure cloths and mask-off other areas. Clean the surface according to instructions on the paint. You may need to apply a primer coat or 3 before hand. Then several coats of paint. Generally speaking: Clean, prime with a thin coat, let it go sticky, then apply a normal dusting of primer, allow to dry, then a thicker coat should be dusted on. Allow to dry, then follow the same procedure with paint.
* Weathered metal should be cleaned with scotchbrite pads or wirewool and perhaps autosol if needed.
* Paint pens are great for hiding those chips on wheel rims or other areas.
* Large scuffs on wheel rims might require paint. Use light coats and follow the advice above.

**Pro tips:**

* Stickers can be removed with gentle heat from a hair-dryer and your fingernails. You shouldn't need to force it any more than that or you risk damaging the finish of your bike.
* Black paint shows scratches really easily. Be gentle.
* When removing bolts, nuts or screws; Be careful. They can strip or snap easily. Make sure you have the correct sized tool, tighten it a little first, then gently but firmly undo it. If the fixing is rusty or seized; Undo it one turn, then tighten a quarter turn and repeat. This stops the thread from jamming. A little penetrating spray helps.
* Those sticky pad marks on your wheel rims? Petrol on a rag and elbow-grease

&gt;Bernera Primary, with its pupil roll of 19, lies at the end of
six miles of single-track road running through a beautiful, barren Western Isles landscape

In Source 2, alliteration is used to highlight to the reader the sheer isolation of this school. The place is described to lie at the end of ""six miles of single-track road"" which runs through a ""beautiful, barren"" landscape. The repetition of the soft ""b"" sounds in ""beautiful"" and ""barren"" reflects the tranquility and serenity of the location. 

Don't be scared to go even further with your analysis even if it sounds a bit wobbly. The examiners will be happy that you are thinking deeply at each individual word. e.g.

The Working Time Directive sets out exactly what breaks you must have on average (it's something like average breaks over a 17 week period). Usually though, steady / scheduled breaks are taken at regular intervals, and daily.

Working 8 hours will entitle her to at least one 30 minute break, and a 15 minute comfort break. These must be uninterrupted, and can be taken as she pleases - i.e. she doesn't have to sit at her desk or anything ridiculous. [Gov.UK has some nice plain english advice.](https://www.gov.uk/rest-breaks-work/overview) As below, [ACAS are useful too.](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1373)

I'd ask your wife to log all events, the times they occur - down to the level of little quotes of what exactly is being said by this manager. Once compiled, she can send these through to HR and reiterate, this is a case of bullying and is an unlawful removal of her right to a rest break.

Things she might want to consider are:

- is it just her? Bullying is any act that's sustained. However, if it's because for example she's female, or young, or any other reason; this becomes unlawful and is [classed as harassment.](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-bullying-and-harassment)
- are there any witnesses; she should get some statements from other people who have seen this manager and their abusive behaviour.
- ring or meet a trade union rep if at all possible, they'll be furious to hear about this and i'm certain will assist. They'll be useful as a professional friend in any future HR meetings (it'll be a boost to your wife's confidence, and also provide an independent witness.)

These are just a few ideas, I hope they help. Happy to give more info/advice if you need - just give me a shout.

The UK government (that includes us) has decided in Westminster. Making a stand in the place that doesn't decide on it just seems silly. We can implement it in full, or we can implement it in part, and pull funding from other part of the Stormont budget to cover the difference. Thats all we can make a stand on. And it's what we had agreed to do until SF pulled out. 

I don't know what they expect to be able to do. At this stage it just seems like they want Stormont to be in some kinds of permanent crisis.

SF don't need to 'prop up' a government to be successful in influencing legislation. Naomi Long got on just fine without propping up the LibDem's.


&gt;it's also uncertain whether a British government, especially a Labour one would interfere with the North

Again, it's not the 'British Government', it's the UK Government, and we're part of it.

They're not inexpensive, I'll grant you that, but they're actually comparable in price when you compare them to notebooks of similar size, materials, and specs. There just aren't much out there. MacBook Pro Retinas are some of the highest spec notebooks out there and are still amazingly thin. They're a feat of engineering. Thin aluminum notebooks with super high resolution IPS screens aren't cheap when PCs either. This all, of course, doesn't even take into account the OS and bundled software.

They're made by Foxconn. Not Toshiba. Toshiba may also contract Foxconn to make some of their notebooks. I'm not sure. Either way, it's more about the quality standards that the company contracting the builds holds the builders too. Toshiba, though bland looking, is still a very reliable brand. You're basically comparing Mercedes to Volvo. They're different target markets.

Isn't that what the word means?

If I have assets of £100,000, I'm going to stick them in a Vanguard fund so I get to enjoy the interest.

A house is an ""asset"" - I can rent it out and live off the income.

It seems like a dehumanising way to talk about individual people - people who have rights, liberty and aspirations.

Thinking of people that way seems to have lead /u/fourhams to some quite funny conclusions about the purpose of education.

&gt; You're the one who assumed that being as asset to society was 'evil'.

Where did I write that?

&gt; I'd rather assume the opposite. If you're not working or helping society or just being nice to your fellow man, then you're a detriment. Profit needn't be involved. Profit needn't be involved.

I'm really sorry, but that's not the opposite - by saying that I'm a ""detriment"" if I don't do as you demand, you're just expressing the same thing in the converse manner. A profit if I benefit you, a detriment if I don't.

And everything else aside, I'm not obliged to be nice to you - that's not the purpose of education.

I'm nice to you because I'm a nice person, but I could conclude from your comments that every business is a detriment to society, because it reaps profit.

null,false,edent,null,null,null,"I inherited a similar sum when I was a few years older than you.  Here's what I wish I'd known...

- Friends and family can react very oddly when you come in to money. People who you think are your friends really just want you to buy them drinks / pay off their loans.  You don't have to tell anyone about this windfall (except, possibly, the taxman. More on that later!)
- It's *really* easy to piss that sum of money away. Bottle of bubbly at a club, taxis home rather than the bus, jewellery for a ""friend"".  Have a little fun with the money - but keep a detailed budget so you know where it's going.
- There are people who will help you - for a fee.  Look at finding an IFA or Wealth Manager you can trust.  They will be able to talk to you about the level of risk with which you're comfortable, and find suitable investments for you.
- Don't go to your bank for help.  Their job is to sell *their own* products.  They won't advise you if the bank down the street has a better rate of return.  Find someone who can look at the whole market.
- Do tell the taxman about the money.  Depending on the complexity of your investments, it may be worth getting an accountant.  They'll help make sure that you pay what you owe the state - and potentially suggest (legal) ways for you to minimise your tax exposure.
- Make sure that all your bank accounts have strong passwords and decent security questions.  Your entire family and childhood friends know what your mother's maiden name is - and what your first pet was called.
- Finally, don't let this go to your head.  £60k is *not* enough money to live on indefinitely.  It's enough to kick-start a business, fund a PhD, have some exotic holidays, or get on the housing ladder - but you can't retire just yet.  Concentrate on getting the best degree you can - and get plenty of useful work experience now you don't have to stack shelves between lectures.

Chasing after potential is more a symptom of our decline since '09 than some perfectly honed financially responsible transfer strategy IMO.

null,false,iHazzam,null,null,null,"So there are 8 colleges not including Grad, but they can be grouped into location quite nicely to make choosing easier

South-west (This includes Lonsdale, Cartmel and Pendle Posh): This is almost exclusivly Superior En-Suite accommodation. A good amount of the students in these colleges are foreign students and exchange students although there are plenty of other people there as well - Cartmel is probably the quietest college as well as great for people wanting catered accommodation.
Lonsdale on the other hand is one of the busiest campus bars and does deals/trips/social nights out to cities a lot so is naturally louder. These colleges in general are further away from all the lectures (~10-15 minutes walk) and are relatively fancy.


Pendle ""Ghetto"" and Grizedale are next closest to the middle of campus. This part of pendle is standard accommodation (still fine though) and is cheaper. Pendle has some good college sport teams/bar sports teams and is one of the loudest colleges at freshers week usually! 
Grizedale (my college) is located near by, and is one of the newest built acommodation. The townhouses are very social (they have the best living space downstairs) and the en-suite is nice as well. Location of these is great for Management students and also the engineering buildings are located near by (although lectures are still a ~10 minute walk for Tech subjects)

In the middle of campus are Fylde and Furness. These have all types of accommodation and are centrally located which is nice. Fylde has a reputation as the ""sporty"" college but that's only really due to the bar showing sports and having pool/darts (and most bars have that) - But as such, lots of sporty people still congregate in this college

Furness is the college I'd choose if I were to pick again. It has a good range of accommodation, nice location, just the general ""feel"" of the college appeals to me as it seems to have a nice atmosphere, the bar is nice although I don't go, it has a social room that you can go in and also book to hang out with friends

Bowland is ""plonked"" right on top of the action - most of the accommodation is very central and it's split between very new and very old (read: ghastly) - although most of the bad stuff has been phased out now I think since Ash house closed last year and was redone

Finally is County, which is decent accommodation at the other ""end"" of campus (Only 5 minutes from lectures though). This has Superior standard and townhouses, both are new and nice and it also does catered as far as I know. Not sure what this college really ""specialises"" in, but having stayed there last summer, it's fine. I think this is the biggest college

This isn't a block - when virgin media block something for legal reasons you get [this page](http://www.trefor.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pirate_bay_step1_medium.jpg) - where they are honest about having to legally block something. When it's their web filter you get [this page](http://www.virginmedia.com/images/web_safe_blocked_inappropiate_site.jpg) . 


As i mention frequently, because imgur is one of the most popular websites, virgin maintain a local cache of it's content. This means that they don't need pay for traffic to imgur , bbc news, all the busiest websites etc,  and it also has the benefit of making the content faster for the end users It's standard for any ISP to do this with large websites, virgin aren't special in this regard. 


What's happened is that there's some issue with their caching system and its' failing to load imgur content - you'd have to get hold of their techs to explain exactly what. Typically when this happens it only affects a small percentage of Virgin Media users (which again is laughable when people cry about blocking - if virgin are blocking it, why isn't it blocked for everyone? Are you going to claim virgin are both blocking it and are incompetent at doing so now? ) -  but this is because they main many caching systems and it's a question of which one users in a particular area are using.


tldr; They aren't blocking it, it's a recurring issue with their caching systems designed to deliver content to you faster.

Whereas you get more money for just being in the CL group stages. Its not that the competition is totally worthless, its just that the likely financial gain from it is worth less than the likely cost of increased games both financially and on consistent performances.

Remember that a squad needs to be bigger to compete in the Europa league, which will cost money, and then there are the extra appearance fees and bonuses for players, and the travel costs to relatively far away places.

Milner, versatile, good all round player, and we need options in midfield. On a free too, so also low risk.

Whilst I understand why some fans may want the Old Firm back in the top flight for entertainment purposes, but you've still said ""I'll always root for them to do well in Europe"" - I can't imagine anyone that supports Celtic feeling this way. I'd never want to see Rangers succeed unless it somehow meant Celtic would gain position in the league (even then begrudgingly). 

I was at the pub sunday watching Motherwell v Rangers with the other Celtic supporters in town and we all wanted Rangers to lose. No real Celtic supporters want Rangers back in the SPFL, regardless whether it was a better league with them in it or whether there was more money available for Celtic with Rangers in the top flight.

""it's good for the league"" - Debatable. Aberdeen, Caley and Dundee Utd (to some extent) have had a great run and the league has been closer than usual for the non-old firm teams. Nice for Aberdeen to get a crack at Europe too this year. It's allowed new challengers to the title.

Do you really want Rangers to ascend 3 tiers of divisions after cheating Scottish Football (do you remember why they went bust?) and then come back to the prem like nothing happened? Or should there be consequences like another season in the Championship? Did you not enjoy seeing their self-proclaimed ""Loyal to the end"" fans leave at 70mins sunday?

Would you really want to see Rangers in the SPFL next year, or instead struggling like they deserve - remember Celtic lost 9 titles in a row because we ran short of funds and could have overspent on top players and then went bust like Rangers (who spent money they couldn't afford to pay back), but we didn't BECAUSE WE PAID OUR TAXES, were honest and saved ourselves the embarrassment of bankruptcy (Fergus McCann said it was 3x more expensive to stay solvent, but we kept our dignity).

The contract applies to the relationship between landlord and the set of tenants. You are each liable for the entire rent - the landlord is entitled to sue any one of you, and will probably go after the person most able to pay. If he comes after you, you will have to pay in full.

The second agreement between the tenants is likely not encoded in a contract, but is nonetheless enforceable.

This gives us a hard salary cap and from there you can work out what wages we can offer. Also, you can look into who has been paid what at spurs over the last 5 years to work out what we can and can't do.

For example, the club offered Bale massive 200k (ish) a week wages before he left, however this meant selling those Bale heart shirts in the spurs shop and would have meant a lot more money from marketing him. Basically, to offer someone that kind of money it has to be a VERY special situation and you would see it coming from a mile away. That's why you know it's bs when someone links us to a player with those kind of wages out of the blue.

Ade was on 180k, but City paid about 100 or so of that and in order to pay him less he was given a large up front bonus. From this, you see more evidence that the club wants to keep the wage bill down (and seemingly will use a bonus to achieve that). This makes sense, because if we got shock relegated the income would drop massively and the wage bill would still be enormous as it is.

For the upcoming season, one would imagine that we are already pretty close to the ""wage cap"". So we would have to free up space by selling players before we brought too many in. I imagine Mason, Bentaleb, Dier and Kane aren't on massive numbers though - meanwhile Soldado and Paulinho would be on a pretty penny.

The main reason the club fell off the boil after Kenny left in 1991 was due to complacency and a sense of entitlement. There seemed to be an attitude of ""we are Liverpool, we have been successful, therefore we deserve to be successful in the future"". Then, as now, this was nonsense. It doesn't matter what we've done in the past. The top four teams have more money, better facilities, and better players than we do. As long as that continues we don't deserve to finish above them. 

 In the 90s, Man Utd came out of the doldrums thanks to an exceptional manager, luck in terms of the youth they had on their books, significant resources thanks to their global fame, and us. A huge part of it was Souness selling half of our squad and replacing them with substandard players. Suddenly we weren't able to challenge for the title, and Leeds and Man Utd were more than welcome to fill the void we left. We failed to modernise, still using a system of promotion from within which had worked in the past but clearly didn't anymore. It only worked after we were successful. Promoting from within when you're finishing 6th is only going to keep you finishing 6th. 

 We showed some ambition by signing Houllier, and we had some success, but the way the club was run meant that we could never compete financially with our rivals or exploit of global name.

  We had a chance a few years ago, on the back of our champs league victory and with Rafa able to attract top players from Spain, to reconsolidate ourselves in the top 4, which we did for a few seasons before the board sold to Hicks and Gillette even though DIC's offer seemed preferable at the time. While we floundered once more, Man City capitalised on strong investment and our failings.

  Then, after last year, we spent our post-Suarez windfall and went backwards. We signed half a dozen new players and got worse. We don't deserve champions league football, but we can get it back regularly. We're where we deserve to be as a club right now because we have sabotaged every opportunity we had to rise back to the top over the last 25 years. We need to be ruthless and we need to forget about our past to a degree. We were the best team in the world half a lifetime ago, but to my children that's going to be as meaningless as the 1950s were to me as a young boy.

I didn't want to start loading cameras again. It's a young man's game. Plus I knew I was never going to be a DP but love lighting. Also one of my best pals is a gaffer who runs a lighting company. It was really his stipulation that made me go to college for two months (full time). He is qualified himself and is sensitive who he puts out with his clients. We do commercials too. 

Anyway to answer your question. No. Honestly I don't think you need it. Why? Because I see too many of the lads getting lucky and ending up on massive features with great careers and becoming gaffers. I dont see any big gaffers asking if your a qualified spark. Ever really. Then I've only been electrical for 5 years so I'm still moving up and learning myself. 

I would learn ohms law inside out. Know your loading. Then just be sensible. It's common sense as I'm sure you've found out. 

Where the course has helped me is confidence. I've started gaffering a little. If something goes wrong I have a good chance of fixing it quick. But that just maybe experience if I'm honest. Also a few times I've had to tail 32amp out of consumer units. I wouldn't really want to see a non qualified spark doing that. 

It's a fine line you tread on bigger jobs too because as you say trainees aren't a thing. Especially on commercials. The boys will see it as bread taken off their table. So you ask a question and the boys want to know why your on the job of you dont know what your doing. But...you need to learn.

Milner gives us options and is a quality, proven player. He's a consummate professional and will be a great influence on the young players in the squad. He's a brilliant free signing.

&gt;

&gt;__James Philip Milner__ (born 4 January 1986) is an English professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays as a [midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder) for [Manchester City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.) and the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team). He previously played for [Leeds United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.), [Swindon Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C.), [Newcastle United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.) and [Aston Villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.). He is mainly a winger but in the 2009–10 season he was utilised in a more central position by Aston Villa. 

&gt;Milner's talent in football, cricket, and long-distance running was recognised at a very young age. He represented his school in these sports and played football for amateur teams from [Rawdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawdon,_West_Yorkshire) and [Horsforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsforth). He supported Leeds United from a young age and was a [season ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_ticket) holder at the club. In 1996, he joined the Leeds United youth academy. He made his debut for the first team in 2002, aged only 16, and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League).

&gt;While at Leeds United, he spent time on loan at Swindon Town to gain experience as a first-team player. Following his move to Newcastle United, he was loaned to Aston Villa for a season. He went on to establish himself as a regular starter in the Newcastle, and later Aston Villa and Manchester City first teams. He made more than 100 appearances for Newcastle, as well as making a record number of appearances for the [England under-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team) team. He made his debut for the full team against the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team) in August 2009 and also played at the [2010 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup) and [UEFA Euro 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012).

Its purpose is to ensure that candidates in single-member constituencies have majority acceptance.  This means that when you have a party with a majority of seats, over 50% of the population have said 'they're good enough'.

The system explicitly does not even try to have overall representation match overall first-choice voting preferences.

So whether you think AV is a good or a bad system depends on what outcomes you want for your government.  If you want a broadly proportional system, then AV is really no better than FPTP.  If you like the arguable stability and purpose of majority governments, AV is a good way of ensuring that a majority of the population are happy enough with the party in power.

It's horses for courses.  Personally I really want STV.  I don't think that single-party majorities are in any way necessary for stability, and I would prefer to have coalitions that represented people's strong preferences than majority governments that people weakly accept.  But I do think that weak acceptance is better than a majority when two-thirds of the population explicitly voted against you.

So I think that STV is streets ahead, but that AV would still have been better than FPTP.",null,0,null,1433201558,null,0,false,0,crselif,null,t3_382220,null,t1_crselif,null,t1_crs551l,null,null,null,1436650660,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Teh2ndrunner,null,null,null,"Jointly and severally liable means that you are all liable for one person's failure to pay their ""share"" of the rent. The landlord has specified further that they can choose to target a particular tenant. In this case, the ""lead tenant"" point is not really material. However, the landlord is able to target you solely.

Best solution would be to pay your friend's share to the landlord ASAP using the following method:

- Each of the 5 tenants (who actually have money) collectively and equally pay the amount owed by your friend to the landlord. That means you paying 20% of your friend's share and the others paying 20% each. This is assuming that you can get the others to agree (they should unless they are dicks). You can then recover this amount from your friend at a later date without worrying about legal action from the landlord. It also prevents YOU personally being stuck with the full amount of outstanding rent. 

The only issue with this approach is that it is not guaranteed that your friend will be able to pay you back / pay future instalments. In which case, you need to consider finding a new housemate to take over his obligation (likely need LL's consent for this but you'd have to check the contract).

&gt;

&gt;__James Philip Milner__ (born 4 January 1986) is an English professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays as a [midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder) for [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team). He previously played for [Leeds United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.), [Swindon Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C.), [Newcastle United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.) [Aston Villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.), and [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.) He is mainly a winger but in the 2009–10 season he was utilised in a more central position by Aston Villa. 

&gt;Milner's talent in football, cricket, and long-distance running was recognised at a very young age. He represented his school in these sports and played football for amateur teams from [Rawdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawdon,_West_Yorkshire) and [Horsforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsforth). He supported Leeds United from a young age and was a [season ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_ticket) holder at the club. In 1996, he joined the Leeds United youth academy. He made his debut for the first team in 2002, aged only 16, and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League).

&gt;While at Leeds United, he spent time on loan at Swindon Town to gain experience as a first-team player. Following his move to Newcastle United, he was loaned to Aston Villa for a season. He went on to establish himself as a regular starter in the Newcastle, and later Aston Villa and Manchester City first teams. He made more than 100 appearances for Newcastle, as well as making a record number of appearances for the [England under-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team) team. He made his debut for the full team against the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team) in August 2009 and also played at the [2010 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup) and [UEFA Euro 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012).

&gt;free money 

It's a loan not 'free money'.  The IMF or International Monetary Fund is not debt issued by Germany it's an international fund, with headquarters in Washington DC.  The IMF has faced criticisms for trying to enforce a full free market agenda on countries that aren't ready to take on that level of freedom or have voted in favour of social-democracy and more involved public sector, by the Overseas Development Institute.  


Greece is simply trying to maintain fiscal autonomy, to honour the democratic mandate by its people who voted for Syriza and to have a chance of actually remaining part of the EU and paying off that debt, if Germany and the rest of the EU can't act like big boys and girls and play together nicely, that means that Greece will leave the EU, leave the Eurozone and likely default on that debt, which is different from an individual defaulting on debt, it usually means the value of that debt is reduced making it toxic.  In either case you end up with no money being paid, staying in the EU, and working to help Greece both honour it's manifesto and pay back its debt, by supporting more infrastructure and clamping down on corruption will probably mean that Germany the ECB and the IMF gets its money back faster, if it's that desperate.


http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis

There was this issue also that a large chunk of this debt is in arms agreements that Greece can't leave and that Germany wants to maintain, whilst asking for the money paid back to the EU bank and IMF.

We shouldn't really forget the reason why the EU was initially set up, as the 1952 the European Coal and Steel Community which was really to stop Germany (and its precursors) going around every so often trying to take its neighbours shit.  


Apparently in Europe we're all in this together now, and should all be one big happy family, until Germany wants to call foul by protecting its own interests even to the detriment to one of its struggling neighbours, and apparently it's Britain that's the one that cherry picks what we want from the EU, huh?  Well I think it's once again Germany trying to flex its muscles and punish malign its neighbours and make them subservient to their will, only now they can't do it with Blitzkrieg they have to do it in the Markets.  At the very least German 'entertainers' need to have a good look at it's own historical stereotypes, there own behaviour in the EU and there behaviour during the economic crisis.  And this is from me, and I'm ardently pro-European.
