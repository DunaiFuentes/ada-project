null,false,thatcambridgebird,null,null,null,"&gt; The short answer is that we can't. We want our cats to live long happy lives, and we believe that letting them roam free in urban areas is incompatible with this. That's our view, and if you don't like it, we won't sell you a cat. 

I've already got three moggies, I don't need any more! ;) 

&gt; The long answer is that all kittens are sold with a pet contract, and this states that breaking the contract (including letting the cat roam free) means that the owner forfeits the kitten to us. Is this contract legally enforceable? Is it practically enforceable? We've no idea. But at least it is a piece of paper that the new owner signs that they will be a responsible cat owner.

I don't know either, though I suspect not as you have surrendered ownership of the kitten over to someone else so the animal is their property - it's not a 'loan' kitten who you retain ownership of. Besides which, morally there's an argument that you would be devastating a family/couple/whoever if you went to their home, because you happened to pass and see the kitten you'd sold them was a grown cat now wandering round outside so you decided to knock on the door and say you were reclaiming the cat (I know this might not be the reality, but you get my meaning) - I can't imagine many people would be on your side in that case, despite you doing what you believe is best for the animal. 

&gt; Anyway, you can disagree with us on the specifics, but we (and all other responsible breeders) only sell kittens to people that we are confident will treat the kitten responsibly.

And that's not a bad thing, I'm not arguing that at all. I applaud that you take responsibility in making sure your animals have the best lives possible. But I think your pet contract is basically unenforcable. All you can do is give possible owners your views, but if they do something different there's not really much comeback you have apart from refusing to give them future kittens. I'm afraid I'm an adopt-don't-buy person anyway, but there'll always be a high percentage of folk who want posh pets. 

&gt; tl;dr - we screen who we sell to

From blatantly sexist gender quotas (going to far as to imply white men are somehow undesirable in their research section), to destructive ""abolish the borders, let anyone who shows up in, and give them all benefits and healthcare"" immigration proposals, to claiming ID cards are somehow racist (seriously, that's in their manifesto), to turning our employment laws into one where it's nearly impossible to either fire or lay people off (which is working well for Italy, right?), to stopping oil and gas drilling and stopping new nuclear power stations (to be replaced with blackouts whenever the wind isn't blowing, presumably), to literally printing money to pay for more wind turbines (again, in their manifesto, ""Green Quantitative Easing""), to wanting to follow the German energy model (which broke their energy market, but who cares because renewables!!!!), to abolishing the free market in favour of vague ""locally sourced"" items, to vetoing foreign companies owning UK-based companies, to abolishing large farms and subsidising small ones, to abolishing supermarkets, to official promotion of vegetarianism, to ending *all* animal testing (to be replaced with human testing, I suppose?).

The Greens don't care any more about the ""common man"" than anyone else. They want to turn the UK into an agricultural backwater where most people are small farmers and rarely travel beyond their local town market, where literally anyone who shows up at an airport or port is waved through, given benefits without question, and given healthcare without question, where anything that isn't renewable is banned and where anything produced by ""foreign companies"" is viewed with suspicion, where everything not ""renewable"" is entirely banned, and where money is literally just printed to fund whatever wild schemes they want to pay for.

The Greens are dangerously incompetent. Yes, the Tories are unfeeling pricks and Labour are the definition of ""hop on the bandwagon"", but the Greens are so unfit to run a country that I'd vote for the BNP long before I voted for the Greens. The BNP would turn us into a nation of isolationist racists, the Greens would entirely end us as a nation.

They're a mix of the worst qualities of communists, the Amish, hippies, bigots and sexists. There's easily no party worse than the Greens to vote for when you actually read their entire manifesto.

""Support for renewables"" sounds lovely, until you realise they actually want to put a stop to absolutely everything else regardless of the consequences.

""More job security"" sounds lovely, until you realise they're more or less proposing employees have all the rights and can largely dictate to their employer how long they'll work for and when they'll take leave, all the while being almost impossible to remove even for good reason.

""More locally sourced produce"" sounds lovely, until you realise they want to get rid of the free market, ban supermarkets, and turn us into a nation that shops at the local village store that's stocked with only stuff grown or produced nearby.

""A fairer economy"" sounds great, until you realise they want to simply print whatever money they need (do they understand there's consequences?) and then contradict themselves by having no immigration policy at all.

Their policy document as a whole reads like a dystopian nightmare. The UK will end up a poor, broken nation that is chronically taken advantage of and whose people are relegated to a life of simple poverty by cripplingly backwards economic policies that will see the price of everything skyrocket and the availability of well-paid jobs collapse.

The thing is that, as I'm sure you did when applying for Uni, that you preferred Queens because of the ""prestigiousness"" of being a Queens student.

Meanwhile, several high-ranking Kainos employees are on the UUJ board and have helped ensure UU course has been developed and maintained to a modern standard.

The problem for Kainos is, the majority of the best CompSci students come from Queens because they are attracted to the aforementioned prestige that's associated with it.

I don't doubt that Kainos can see past seeing QUB as a ""red mark"" on an application, but they hate that the quality students they want to hire are working with outdated knowledge in both practices and (especially) technologies (in regards to the courses learning material, obviously not from learning you've been doing outside of it.)",null,0,null,1424964935,null,0,false,0,coxuxzc,null,t3_2x84e0,null,t1_coxuxzc,null,t1_coxugvc,null,null,null,1427467482,null,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10,null

this girl made my life a living hell growing up, social kept putting us in the same homes together even though she bullied and tortured me. have no pity on her, shes evil always have been always will be. shes where she needs to be. she is the definition of psychopath. staff at the childrens home never stopped her from hurting me because they was scared of her too. iv always said she is going to end up killing some one these days, she has no remorse, no sympathy, nothing, shes cold to the core. I have grown up with this monster. she deserves all she gets. shame she cant be locked up for life, she will just come out and hurt people again and again, evan children, she went to prison (secure childrens unit) at the age of 14 for violently attacking two little girls, she came out and still hadn't learned as she still carried on hurting me. having a troubled up bringing does not give you the right to do the things she has, like I said we both grew up in the same circumstances, I have a bad past but I am 20 years old and I have never hurt anyone, I'm starting collage, I got a small job, im doing good, all I can say is karmas a *****

In this phrase alone you paint a notion of a society frozen by its own antiquated attitudes and somehow unable to change. We know this is false because there are no longer Stag Bars in pubs or racially offensive 'comedies' on our TV and women are not referred to as dolly birds or tarts in day to day conversation. Hell, even page three has finally bitten the dust.  

In this light the ad we were originally discussing is simply anachronistic - the creative team, whether alone or at the client's request chose an idiom that is deeply frowned upon for reasons I'm sure I don't need to highlight to you.

The society I live in expects change... and campaigns for it wherever and whenever possible. Hell, even being an unmarried mother is no longer seen as a sin. Something changed along the way clearly.

As far as the bell curves are concerned. Have the distributions changed over time / location or are they the same as they were in the 50s, 60s, 70s etc? 

The society I live in has changed dramatically since I was in my teens. Accepting racial taunts was generally seen as 'just one of those things'. These days my life is completely devoid of them *because we changed peoples' attitudes.* Education, campaigns, pressure groups and finally legislation removed much of the deep racism that many of my generation and older than me experiences. 

Your attitude towards the inevitability of social status seems to imply that change is not possible, and look we have graphs to prove it. The graphs in the document I linked earlier tell a different story if you take even a quick glance.

&gt;I'm sure that both yourself and society have already (whether inadvertently or not) imparted the latter

Which is why my daughter is a campaigning feminist on her campus. People drive change, you seem reluctant to accept that. I guess I'm bad father if I didn't successfully inculcate the hopelessness of success in my daughter's mind because it's what 'society expects'.

And again the piece you cite about Princeton alumni is written critically by the writer, and not as an acceptance of an outmoded way of thinking.

&gt; Seriously....

That's a big hint. 1st word 2nd para.

The other links you insist on including all point at some sort of notion of horror that women should even consider themselves as hard done to. But instead should accept the bell curve, no matter which decade it was from and just hunker down to accept failure or terrible disappointment. And not organise to improve representation and status and salaries and success.

null,false,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,null,"Haha yes! Refreshments and football go together hand in hand in the same way you would with a cinema. You can even buy beer inside.

My tip is, just like with a cinema, don't eat inside. Firstly the queues are awful. If you want half-time refreshments you'll have to start queuing before half-time and even then you might not get served before the start of the second half. Secondly the space inside the stands is pretty limited so often everyone queueing just takes up the whole corridor and it's hard to get out once you have been served. Thirdly the prices are a joke, it's probably going to be more of a shock if you don't come from London. I think they wanted £1 or more a few years back for a flaming bar of chocolate. I could forgive the first two if the prices were cheap but they're not.

I suggest getting to the ground really early. Like 2hrs before kick-off. That sounds like a waste of time but really it'll be a lot easier than the alternative. Pick up your tickets and go and find somewhere to eat before the crowds invade. I suggest a local business like Chick-king or my favourite Pavro Ocakbasi where you can sit down for a meal at a reasonable price and decent quality.

&gt; Lax money laundering controls at HSBC allowed two cartels to move $881 million in drug proceeds through the bank over the second half of the last decade

Yeah right, a ""subsidiary"" moved a billion dollars across the US border in 5 years without the main branch noticing anything. Tell them that next time they freeze your account for a 20£ cash deposit abroad.

&gt; if they dug into Santander they'd find a lot of similar stuff.

Arguably knowledgeable people seem to think otherwise:

&gt; a local drug lord referred to [HSBC] as the ""place to launder money""

-

&gt; You can't blame financial institutions for using loopholes.

Or can you?

&gt; HSBC is now facing criminal charges in Belgium and criminal investigation in France on the allegation that it “knowingly promoted serious and organised tax fraud”

-

&gt; Who are the US to tell everyone else who they can and cannot deal with?

-

Yay for the US ""[best ally](http://truthstreammedia.com/whistleblower-hsbc-still-laundering-money-for-terrorists-drug-cartels/)""

&gt;  HSBC was allowing millions of dollars to be moved [to] financiers of Hezbollah.

Best ally [indeed](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/western-banks-terrorism-isis-nihilism-dark-finance-fuelling-global-insecurity-1474508)

&gt; [US Iraq war] veterans are suing several financial institutions in a lawsuit accusing the banks of helping to fund the militants who attacked them

Tell them that next time they tell you they need more of your money and more surveillance power over you to protect you from terrorism.

They're fucking you up the ass with a condom, and you say ""technically they're fucking a condom, not my ass, so it's ok"". Obviously you keeping your meager HSBC account makes no difference whatsoever, you're a pawn just like me, but if you and your likes don't even realize the seriousness of the facts that are put under your nose then those guys have so totally, doubly won!

The Lampard thing where they set up a team in America, it pays the wages and then loans him back to City so they don't have his wages on their books.

On top of what they legitimately earned to be given a massive cash injection like that from a sugar daddy corporation means they can keep ticket prices down. It's how they are getting around the fair play rules.

They don't bring in Liverpool's revenue but can spend £300,000 on several players and stay within FFP rules.",null,0,null,1424967814,null,0,false,0,coxwlj4,null,t3_2x7wp5,null,t1_coxwlj4,null,t1_coxqu7e,null,null,null,1427468255,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Ajax has by far the youngest team of the remaining 32 clubs in the Europa League.

The side that played last week in the first leg with Legia Warsaw had an average age of 21.91 years.

Jasper Cillessen and Nick Viergever were the only Ajax players at kick-off who were born in the eighties. At eighteen years old Riechedly Bazoer is the baby of the group.

The second youngest team in the last Europa League round was PSV, who started the match against Zenit St. Petersburg with an average age of 23.27. Eindhoven's youngest player was Jetro Willems at 20 years old and Andrés Guardado was the oldest, at 28.

The Danish side Aalborg was the only other team with the average age of under 24.

As noted by someone else, the others were charged with violent disorder as it seems they didn't actually wound anyone.

You're totally right that education correlates with class, but when I say ""middle class"" what I actually mean is ""Those above the bottom rungs of society, but not high enough to be running it"".

In the UK this means educated and well paid professionals who aren't members of the rich upper class or the ruling elite. In Haiti around the time of the revolution, this meant educated mixed race and house slaves who were educated and maybe freed by their masters.

All the major revolutions feature this:

* The communist revolutions of the 1900s were fueled by Karl Marx, a well educated middle class philosopher who wrote Das Kapital. However, this book wasn't passed around the working classes as they wouldn't be able to understand it. Instead people read it and spoke of it's meanings, roused the working classes and eventually stormed the winter palace etc.

* The American Revolution actually started with a toast to ""their"" King. It was lead by the people now referred to as the Founding Fathers, well educated liberal minded people who organised the colonists. The Boston Tea party isn't a revolutionary act, it's an act of defiance. Arming yourselves and driving the British from your shores before forming your own system of government is revolutionary.

* The French Revolution was carried out while it was lead by well educated and wealthy individuals. Sure they killed the King and the landed aristocracy, but the people doing the leading and organising of the revolution were never actually poor themselves.

It's very interesting actually, because people don't like to think that the working class can be oppressed simply because they aren't as educated as the middle classes, but there is practically no evidence of successful revolutions where the middle class didn't side with the working class.",null,0,null,1424968827,null,0,false,0,coxx7x5,null,t3_2x7zxc,null,t1_coxx7x5,null,t1_coxw43w,null,null,null,1427468544,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Shows like GOT and HOC can be expensive because they have a market of hundreds of millions of people.

The only way private production companies in the UK will ever achieve those sorts of budgets is if they can sell it in America.

And in order to sell it in America, British culture is either reduced to American stereotypes, or replaced wholesale with American culture (most British TV exports are refilmed with American actors, for example).

Look at TV and film content in Europe. It's pretty bad. With the UK, it will be even worse because there will be such a strong temptation to produce content for America. Hardly anyone will produce content for the niche British market when they can produce Americanised content that will be bought in American and in Britain both.

Sky probably has a similar budget to the BBC. How much British programming do they actually produce? They don't have any British shows like Dr. Who or Sherlock that I know of. Abolish the BBC, boost their funding by ~%50 and they'll just buy more American shows, and if they do actually get around to producing some high budget stuff of their own they'll make sure they can sell it in America too.",null,0,null,1424969331,null,0,1424970184,0,coxxjch,null,t3_2x7ige,null,t1_coxxjch,null,t1_coxuzut,null,null,null,1427468692,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Secondly, these wars were not successful. The first resulted in the Magna Carta which, despite current popular opinion, was largely ignored for hundreds of years. The second Baron's war was initially successful, but then failed to take hold and the rebels were all brutally murdered.

Finally, this is all relative. At the time the King and his court were the upper classes, and the Barons, knights etc were the middle classes, and everyone else was a peasant. There was no rich merchant class, no professional people. As wealth and status at this time was nearly always tied directly to land ownership, a Baron with a small plot of land is basically the equivalent of today's accountant or lawyer.

I'm guessing that may have been written a while ago though.  

I did a quick scan of a few images ""last modified"" headers and there was one that claims it was updated in 2011 (most were 2006/2007 though).  But it might have been updated in 2011 at least.

null,false,Critzor,null,null,null,"&gt; Chelsea are ready to sign off the second-largest shirt sponsorship deal in English football history with Yokohama Rubber.
&gt; It is understood the Yokohama agreement is worth almost £40m-a-year, which will push Chelsea ahead of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the shirt sponsorship table. Only Manchester United have a more lucrative deal, having netted £53m-a-year from Chevrolet.
&gt; The new shirt sponsorship with Yokohama is more than double the previous £18m agreement with Samsung that was last extended in 2012 and is seen within Stamford Bridge as a significant success for Christian Purslow, who was appointed to run Chelsea’s global activities in October last year.
&gt; Chelsea had been in talks with Turkish Airlines, but they withdrew their interest in a sponsorship deal at Christmas after being put off by the figures involved.
&gt; Yokohama worldwide has a business network spanning over 100 countries, including the US, Japan China and Australia, and the company already has sponsorship deals with NBA teams the Boston Celtics and the San Antonio Spurs.
&gt; Yokohama will have their logo across the Chelsea shirts from the start of next season.

I also think we should have spent a little extra and gotten a world class winger rather than Lamela, someone like Pedro or Hulk.  As far as strikers go, I think we should have brought Morata to the club.  Madrid (who had Morata at the time) desperately wanted Bale and I think we could have easily pushed to have him included in the deal.  As far as defenders go, I think Shkodran Mustafi would have been a better buy than chiriches.  He already had premier league experience with Everton and would have cost about the same amount.

I realize this scenario would probably have seen us spend slightly more than we received for Bale, but I think all of these players would have been good investments.  
Imagine this starting lineup: Lloris, Walker, Mustafi, Vertonghen, Rose, Kovacic, Bentaleb, Pedro/Hulk, Eriksen, Chadli, Kane/Morata.

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; Have the distributions changed over time / location or are they the same as they were in the 50s, 60s, 70s etc? 

They've stayed the same.

&gt; Your attitude towards the inevitability of social status seems to imply that change is not possible

Only in terms of the drive to be attractive to the opposite sex, which isn't something that has changed throughout history or across societies.

&gt; People drive change, you seem reluctant to accept that.

Not at all, it is just some things can and should be changed and others can't and shouldn't.

&gt; I guess I'm bad father if I didn't successfully inculcate the hopelessness of success in my daughter's mind because it's what 'society expects'.

This is the second time you've tried to use this particular straw man. Do you have some kind of particular attachment to it?

&gt; The other links you insist on including all point at some sort of notion of horror that women should even consider themselves as hard done to.

I was making the point that sexual exclusion goes far more in one direction than the other these days, an example of a change that has happened that you claim I deny.

&gt; But instead should accept the bell curve, no matter which decade it was from and just hunker down to accept failure or terrible disappointment.

Hmmnn... so you don't understand what the Bell curve is either? The Bell curve means that more women are of average intelligence than men whereas fewer men are of average intelligence than women. It doesn't mean all women are average or all men are geniuses or criminals.

&gt; And not organise to improve representation and status and salaries and success.

By all means, be Machiavellian. Just don't believe that it is in the cause of equality when it isn't.

&gt; As a curio how does the bell curve explain the gender bias of FTSE 100 CEO community

I think they've got a cool logo and typeface - certainly less bulky than Turkish Airlines. It'll probably be on a single line and lightweight, so I can't see it occupying more real estate in the middle of the kit than Samsung currently does.

My hope is that they keep the logo similar to the way it's pictured in the rumours [floating around](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B7fWk-lIgAAa_ud.jpg) in that they make the stylized 'Y' white instead of their trademark red.

Are you really trying to argue that Sherlock, Doctor Who (which is shit), EastEnders (which is worse) and probably the odd documentary justify a guaranteed tax on the British people, because that's ridiculous? There is no special British programming which only the BBC can provide which justifies a tax of almost £150 per year. You call Easterners a public good, but there is no fundamental difference between that and Coronation Street which is provided privately.

British audiences are becoming far more interested in premium American TV because it is simply more entertaining, and is of higher quality. Contrary to your views that the free market provides poor quality TV. The lowest common denominator enjoy shows like The Voice and EastEnders, which the BBC seem all too happy to provide at an ever increasing rate. British TV is nothing special with or without the BBC.

If so it related to their automatic accounting process for the previous tax year - 6th April 2013 to 5th April 2014 - they sum up all tax receipts and compare to what you should have paid and issue refunds or demands if there are discrepancies

This is normal. They would also have issued your employer with a PAYE coding notice if they had found errors, that reflected your proper tax code for the current year. Your employer then issues a tax rebate through your salary for any overpayments made since 6th April 2014

However as mentioned by someone else, the area counted in this survey isn't just 'the midlands' but the east of England too, if so then that's another 2 TV services and about 6 more radio. 
If it counts Oxford then add another two for each medium

Get well soon :-)

20': Nice idea between Eriksen, Chadli and Davies down the left. Leads to nothing as their triangle passing is intercepted by Richards. Good try from spurs. 

21': Goal Kick to Fiorentina.

22': Tottenham with most of the midfield possession. Stambo with a cross from just inside the final third leads to a spurs corner to be taken by Eriksen.

22': Corner taken short, nothing comes of it. Leads to jossling around the box for possession. Eventually Fiorentina come away with the ball. 

24': Tottenham winning far more of the midfield battles and coming away with the ball more of the time. Nothing currently too exiting happening. Fernandez looks to be injured for Fiorentina and is sitting on the ground receiving treatment. 

25': Throw in for Fiorentina, on their left defensive side. Fernandez off due to injury for Aquilani. Like for like swap. Long ball over the top by Fazio for Soldado called offside.  

27': Tottenham comfortable in possession, passing it around nicely between the midfield and defence. Bentaleb with some good balls. Soldado eventually played through with a good through ball but goalkeeper collects. Quick counter for Fiorentina results in offside called against Gomez. 

28': Tottenham trying hard but failing to break into the final third of Fiorentina. Dispossessed by Fiorentina and a quick break with Salah at the ball results in a corner. Corner not too dangerous. 

29': **Spurs miss a ridiculously golden chance** Oh deary me, Spurs break well from the Fiorentina corner. It results in a TWO ON ONE, Chadli and Soldado vs. the keeper and Soldado misses his pass to Chadli for the tap in and the keeper collects. Oh dear me Soldado. No excuse for Soldado on that one. 

32': Long ball over the top to Chadli called offside. Back to that chance, will Tottenham regret this. It looked like a certain goal for either Soldado or Chadli. Soldado on the middle-right side of the penalty area, passes the ball across the penalty spot to Chadli but the pass is weak and bobbly, and the keeper who was off his line dives and collects. 

33': Vertonghen breaks forward with Davis down the left, spurs comfortable in possession again in the midfield. Just probing the opposition defence. FK to fiorentina after Gomez comes off the worse in a 50/50.

37': FK for spurs, Erisken over it! 35 yards out and it hits the wall, We get the rebound and fire it in from the wing as a cross. Tottenham pressing really hard right now, Fiorentina under the kosh big time. Spurs pressing hard. Eventually a FK is given to Fiorentina and they clear.

39': GOmez with a good chance for Fiorentina there. A shot from the left side 6 yards out blocked by Fazio and cleared.

40': On review the Fazio block against Gomez was actually a hand ball incident! Determined ball to hand however as it was a ricochet.

41': Fiorentina break down the left but Fazio cleans up with a no nonsense clean tackle. Fazio has been beast mode tonight. Things starting to look a little more Fiorentina sided as we come to the end of the half. 

42' They break down the right and Salah gets a shot away under pressure from Davies. The shot goes high and wide however and nearly enters orbit. 

44': Corner for spurs, Eriksen to take! It was a really good delivery, the ref thinks the GK was impeded (he wasn't tbh)... fk to Fiorentina. 

45': 1 min extra time. Things looking sloppier all over the pitch from both teams. Eriksen dispossessed on the edge of the fiorentina box. Davies gets the ball, cross is too long. Eventually ball falls back to Eriksen who crosses from the left wing and Lamela gets a head on it but the ref thinks Lamela was impeding and a FK is called. 

**HT 0-0** 

Half time thoughts... Spurs looked better overall, Fiorentina look dangerous on the counter attack but have had no real opportunities. We royally fucked up that chance thanks to an awful pass from Soldado :(((((

We can still do this lads! It's going to be a nervous 45 minutes though. 

Besiktas 0-0 Liverpool still currently. Celtic With Van Dijk sent off 0-0 against Inter. Here comes the second half!

46': Spurs immediately from their KO concede a throw in on the halfway line. FK given from the throw to Fiorentina taken quickly. Fiorentina break down their left wing, they cut inside and shot goes over the bar.

47': Fiorentina in possession passing it around the back. Spurs pressing well regain the ball. 

48': Everywhere we goooooo!!! Spurs fans in good voice, you can hear them clearly! Chadli breaks down the left and crosses low into the box, noone there and the GK collects.

49': Fiorentina break well down their left wing and the resultant cross misses everyone. Fiorentina in possession now. Throw in for them on the left wing... results in a GK for spurs. Tottenham in possession once again.

50': Collision between Davies and ... results in a *yellow* for Ben Davies. Davies will miss the next Europa game.

51': BIG CHANCE FOR FIORENTINA.... A break down the right results in the ball being struck from just inside the middle of the penalty area. The strike goes straight to Lloris however. Let off for spurs. 

You have to say that spurs will have to get a goal in the next 20 minutes or so before things start feeling desperate. The officiating has been poor today. Fiorentina fans getting hostile.

**Goal for Fiorentina** 54': Fazio cheaply gives the ball away on the halfway line.... Gomez through on goal and slots it past Lloris.

55': One goal will take it to Extra Time, we need 2 to win. Tottenham are entirely to blame for this game currently. We missed a sitter... and absolute sitter and we are completely at fault for this goal too. 

57': Fiorentina player stretchered off... didnt catch the name of the swap but it's a like for like swap. Fiorentina down to just one sub left.

58': Second half spurs have looked worse than Fiorentina. IMO Soldado off for Kane. 

60': Spurs in possession, Bentaleb with a wasteful ball. Fiorentina back in possession. Tottenham pls....

61': Kane getting ready to be subbed on!

62': **Big chance for Fiorentina**: Salah breaks well, gets into a good position against Lloris and should have scored. Lloris with the most important of saves. The break from Fiorentina was caused by Lamela being dispossessed. 

63': Spurs double change, Townsend on for Chadli, Kane on for Bentaleb. Another shooting chance from outside the box for Fiorentina..

64': Fiorenta unleashing volley after volley of attacks against spurs right now. 

Spurs playing 4-4-2 currently with Kane and Soldado up front... Townsend and Lamela on the wings with Eriksen and Stambo in the middle. 

66': Spurs giving the ball away a lot more as they are looking more desperate to get a goal. More through balls from us are getting intercepted and we arent retaining possession currently. 

67': Davies gets into a good crossing position on the left, the cross was really poor however.

70': Not much to speak of. Fiorentina set up to defend. Spurs in possession. Things aren't looking bright if i am honest. Spurs finding it hard to break down this defence and get into the box.

71': **Goal for Fiorentina**: Salah scores after horror defending. Looked like it was a foul on Vertonghen if I am honest. But there it is. I can't see us coming back from this. If we  get two back and its 2-2 at the end we win the tie however.

72': On review.... not a foul on Verts, just horror defending from him, he didn't clear it when he had the option. The through ball to Salah was his to claim but he failed to clear it and salah nicked the ball and scored. Fuck sake.

74': FK for spurs just outside the box on the right side. Walker coming on for Vertonghen.  

76': Eriksen takes the kick and it hits the wall. CB pairing is Chiriches and Fazio. Walker at RB. Spurs in possession in midfield now. 

77': Kane scores but it's offside. It was offside by a long way. Nothing to see here. 

78': Kane also scored an offside goal against West Ham at about the 78th minute ... please please please deja vu happen

81': It's not looking good lads, spurs throwing more and more forward. Fiorentina getting more and more room on the break. Fiorentina look good on the break, we dont look good when we're attacking. It's not really working right now.

85': See above comment. Lots of FKs for Fiorentina too. 

86': Eriksen long shot outside the box saved out for a corner... we need something soon. Corner taken short. Nothing comes of it. FK for spurs, right wing.

87': FK whipped in by Townsend, flicked over the bar a couple of yards. 3 minutes to go, we need a goal now or never.

90': Streamed died for a couple of mins. Still 0-0 guys. Not looking good :((((((

90+1; 3 mins of extra time. Not looking to threatening unfortunately. Looks like we're gonna lose. Get those beers ready. 

**FT 2-0. 3-1 Aggregate** What else to say, we fucked it up, 1 offensive and 2 defensive errors cost us the game.

For me this is the perfect blend of talent for a 3-man midfield. A defensive rock, a creative passer, and a versatile marauder.

I'd have Matic sitting back in his defensive midfield role, with Pogba and Fabregas just in front and exchanging positions with each other - as one goes forward the other drops back a little.

This kind of setup could lend itself well to a 4-3-3, which is something I've been hoping to see this season.

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"Actually I think those are very ~~optimistic~~ realistic odds. It's as safe a Tory seat as it was under Aitken 20+ years ago.

Dr Ladyman enjoyed a serious bounce when Blair came in to power. Like many of the 1997 Labour winners they reflected the charisma of Blair and their seats were practically gifts. Ladyboy's in particular because, well, Aitken and that whole prison thing...

Ladybird was an excellent constituency MP. Under him Ramsgate and Broadstairs actually became nice places. Even with Sandy ""Backhandy"" Ezekiel on the council Ladyman was able to revamp the area and make it look respectable, even while Margate suffered under Roger Gale. Yet his lead got narrower and narrower, his last victory in 2005 by just 500 votes or thereabouts.

Laura Sandys has been abysmal however. While Ladyman was happy to correspond with disgruntled members of the public, dear Duncanella fails to engage at any level. She is fucking useless, and couldn't even do the one thing she promised in 2010: bring Channel 5 to analogue TVs in Thanet (one of the issues that really matter). If it weren't for the fact that she's standing down this year she would still get elected on a landslide, Farage or no Farage.

Like it or not, my dear neighbours are staunchly conservative. While Niggle will get substantially more than 2% of the vote in Fannit Sarff the next Tory candidate will win comfortably. Will Scobie of Labour, despite being a local boy (and current mayor of Margate) is just too well groomed for us salt of the earth types, and will probably come a close third behind Smiling Pint Man.

So my odds are:

Tory: evens

UKIP: 5/2

Labour: 10/1 (so I agree with the article)

The Other Smiling Pint Man, Al Murray: 10/1 as well

Liberal Democrats: 25/1

Greens: 25/1

Britain First (yes, they exist round our way): 50/1.

I doubt anyone else has the wit or imagination to stand as a local independent candidate so I think that's pretty much the entire list.

null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"You could have something there -- it's certainly a plausible idea.  But I favor the idea that Clara blossomed in Season 8 into a much stronger, more clearly delineated character that I cared about.  She got herself tangled up in lies not because she likes lying, but because she's trying to hold onto *both* of her lives and companions (teacher/Danny vs. adventurer/Doctor), the way we do when we're trying to avoid making a hard decision for one alternative and against the other.  She's in absolute bits over Danny's death, and saying it's ""boring"" is anger talking.  He died because she had finally made up her mind but wasn't patient enough to wait to tell him in person, so he was distracted by her phone call and stepped into oncoming traffic.  So she's feeling guilt too, and that motivates her last-ditch effort to force the Doctor into reversing Danny's death.  That's not her ""true colors"" -- it's Clara pushed over the edge by her own grief, horror, and guilt over Danny's death.  To me, this makes her a much more effective and internally consistent character, as opposed to ""unraveling"".

On the other hand, Steven Moffat is quoted here and there as saying that Clara is becoming more like the Doctor, which also means more estranged from her own humanity.  So maybe you're right and she does need a ""rescue"" from these changes, since she can't actually *become* an alien, and if she loses her connection with her own species, then what will she be?  If the Doctor loves her -- and he does (as you would a loyal companion who's saved your life many times) -- he will have to decide between wanting to keep her with him as a companion and a conscience, and wanting to return her to her own humanity for her own sake.  That pits selfishness against altruistic love, a strong conflict even without adding in Clara's own feelings about the matter.

I think it's too soon to consider things because Terry is here at least until the end of next season. Ivanovic will be 32/33 in the season that Terry may leave, which is quite old for a full back. I also doubt he would slot straight into the CB role, as I think he has obviously been taught to attack a lot and that could transfer into his CB role. 

My hope would be Matic. In a season or two, he will have been here for quite a long time if you consider that he was also here before he moved to Benfica. He plays in a central role which is what Jose likes in his captains, and is a great player. He usually is very calm, and is a big, strong, powerful guy who takes a lot of the team talks. To me him and Ivanovic are the most likely candidates for captain.

Cesc is also in with a shout, as he has the experience and is a good leader, but that may make the other players feel annoyed as they have been there longer.

null,false,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,null,"I have four bikes which are theoretically road legal. One has the tank and gubbins off in preparation for a valve clearance job. Last Saturday one got a flint in the back tyre - not something I could plug, so I was going to get the tyre changed on Monday. On Sunday morning I was due to take a church service about fifteen miles away, so I hopped on the Bonnie. Which doesn't start, for the first time ever - weak battery I think, and cold weather. So I get out my old TT250R, a 20-year old trail bike that I'd got recently, partly as a last resort for snowy weather. It's right at the back of the garage, so it took a bit of time to get it out, but I'd left a bit of safety margin on the time. I got out to the motorway and revved up to its top speed of about 60mph.

Half a mile down the motorway, it cuts on to reserve. Now I've never had this bike on reserve, but I've only got about twelve miles to go at this point, so it should be ok. Then it starts faltering again and the speed dropped to 15mph, with the engine varying between full throttle and nothing a couple of times a second. Oh &lt;dingbats&gt;!

It's clearly fuel starvation, so I backed off the throttle and it started running cleanly at 20mph. I coaxed it up to 30 - and the engine stopped. By this time I'm running late for the service. I guessed I was getting a bit of fuel through the petrol tap, so I coasted for a bit with the clutch in to let the carb re-fill, then got it to restart. Ran slowly for another mile, then stopped. In all I think it stopped eight times before I got to a service station to re-fill the tank, each time getting worse as the sediment from the bottom of the tank clogged the petrol tap, until I was pushing 200 yards before it would re-start, wearing a suit under waterproofs - then each time trying to hitch my gear up so that I could get a leg over the seat, which is up near the height of my navel.

And a lot of what makes it interesting is that most people default reply will be something like what you just replied; ""you cant call everyone who argues with you a shill, that just makes you a paranoid person, and undermines you""

But, then we do know for sure that Israel pays people to argue for it in online arguments like this. ""[Here is a BBC article](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896), but I just googled 'Israel online shill' and literally every result was something new, its really well documented - [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AQu4KtWWz4) of some sort of training seminar for online shills, if you need more just google the terms, there are thousands of examples.

So, given that there definitely are people online being paid to argue for Israel - what are the chances that you have read something by someone like that? I have no idea. But if you think about it, they are only going to be in places where people are arguing about Israel online. And you also obviously go to places like that (since you are here now reading this post about Israel), so if they are any good at their jobs, you probably have read something by them. If their words didn't get read by people like you, if they were not able to manipulate people's opinions in this way, then why would they do it?

No they don't. They got rid of it like two years ago along with that module.

They could do more but in the early stages at least the focus has to be on basic programming. If secondary schools could teach a bit more programming then maybe you could have better and more advanced programming taught earlier on. Though when I did the concurrency module it wasn't just theory.

It wasn't what I was suggesting but I actually would totally support that statement.

&gt;North Sea wells can easily cost $50 million each - do you really think that they don't know what is down there and what they expect to get in return for their investment?

Yes, because I help drill them, and I've seen more than a couple of duds.

&gt;We produced to a high degree of detail 14, 30 and 90 day plans. We had 12 month plans that were routinely refined; our reservoir engineers had longer term plans that showed production forecasts of 5 years and more.

Right, forecasts, but 5 year production is dependent on exploration, drilling new wells, reliant upon wells continue to produce at their forecast rates which they often don't do, requiring workovers which of course require money to be spent, which is all dependent on the health of the company which is itself dependent on global markets and the price of oil.",null,0,null,1424977984,null,0,false,0,coy33ax,null,t3_2wzzyb,null,t1_coy33ax,null,t1_coxmp5k,null,null,null,1427471348,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

For example ambushing someone in a dark park with a knife to their throat is much, much worse than manipulating your girlfriend into it, *although that is obviously still horrible*. It means dozens of factors have to be taken into consideration to determine the sentence. Rape *is not* rape. Crime *is not* crime.

Also, it has to be put in context. Our justice systems are horrible at dealing with rape. Only around 2% (upper estimate) of rapists can expect a jail sentence as less than 10% are reported to police, the police only investigate a certain amount due to complete lack of evidence, again a lower level are prosecuted and again even less can be proved in court. In this context, any jail sentence is a victory. 

Saying the sentence is fair is not empathising. His life is completely and utterly ruined because of that moment, as it probably should be. Being on the sex offenders list has driven many people to suicide so maybe you can hope for that outcome in the long run, I guess.

The state should not be in the business of revenge.

At least 160 children as of 2009 are confirmed. The true number and the number since then is probably a lot higher, but unknown.

Gaza and Hamas can't do more because they don't have the ability. They will fight as dirty as ISIS to get what they want. History proves it. Nothing in Gaza right now suggests otherwise. 

Their one-track quest to take over Israel has taken priority over keeping their own people safe and prosperous. You can't look at any snapshot in time to understand their situation. Just 10 years ago, Israel dismantled all of the Gaza settlements and left them perfectly functional infrastructure. The gesture was ignored, they elected Hamas, began terrorist attacks against Israel. And two years later were they even blockaded. 

Now Israel is expected to reward their behaviour? Firing tens of thousands of rockets and mortars, shooting at school busses, violent home invasions and murders, suicide bombing of civilians, bus bombings, etc... Israel has no choice but to eliminate this threat, even if they weave into Gazan society to use its population as human shields. There is no other way.

Obviously that's unlikely and would be entirely unfair, but the UK rental system doesn't really understand fair.

Bloke is either very busy/rich and it's not worth his time, losing his marbles or the property is some sort of front (my money is on MI6 safe house... *obviously*)

If it's that he's busy and very rich then you don't want to become a problem that will take up more time than he deems it's worth!

My advice would be to send him a written letter (if you have his address obviously) via recorded delivery. That way you can ensure both that you sent a letter and that he received it, that would provide you plenty of proof that you made every fair effort to pay him the rent should this ever come around and bite you on your arse.

But realistically, I can't see how it could ever come around and sting you. You've put the money aside, phoned him and made plenty of effort to pay the rent. Obviously it's a strange situation and I'd worry as well, but try not to worry too much about this ever becoming a major problem!

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"The DrWhoGuide site that you link to is fine, but not very up to date. They don't include any of the Twelfth Doctor novels, or Engines of War for example, and I'm not sure that it's being updated at all now.

Most of the novels (or short stories) are stand-alone adventures, AFAIK, except the New Adventures line - featuring the Seventh Doctor, the Eighth Doctor novels, and the Darksmith Legacy, featuring Ten. 

All of those series are more tied into particular self-contained continuities. Within them (well the Seventh and Eighth Doctor ones) there are still quite a few stand-alones, but they are generally best taken in order. 

Otherwise, it is best to watch at least some of the TV stories featuring the relevant Doctor beforehand - in order to picture their mannerisms and speech patterns etc, but you can dive in to most of the novels pretty much as independent stories. Several of them feature references to some of the TV stories (and occasionally to other novels), but only a few require an in depth knowledge of other TV stories to appreciate (a few examples would be *Who Killed Kennedy?*, *The Dark Path* and *The Time Travellers* - all very good tales, but probably not the best places to start without being pretty familiar with Classic Who TV).

If you are thinking of starting with the Eighth Doctor novels, it would probably be a good idea to listen to at least a few of the Big Finish audio tales featuring him first - to get a better appreciation of McGann's style - even though many would suggest that the novels are in a completely separate continuity.

I'm working my way through all the novels, short stories, audios and comics from the first Doctor onwards, and my favourites so far are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/23pxb5/first_doctor_novels_short_stories_audio_and/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2b77oi/second_doctor_novels_shortstories_audio_and/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2sr9g0/third_doctor_novels_shortstories_audio_and_comics/).  

Otherwise, the best of the three Twelfth Doctor novels so far is *The Blood Cell*, and, as /u/TheGallifreyan says, *Engines of War* is also very good (although a bit of a missed opportunity when portraying the *time-* aspect of the Time-War, IMHO).",null,0,null,1424979045,null,0,false,0,coy3sa8,null,t3_2x921a,null,t1_coy3sa8,null,t3_2x921a,null,null,null,1427471672,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

He hasn't performed well, but it's been other people too at times.  It seems like everyone forgets that Distin was absolutely atrocious and cost goals too.  

I still think there's too much pressure on Timmy - you're not going to get a lot of clean sheets if the keeper has to work a lot during a game. He shouldn't have spilled those balls, but how many freaking corners did Leicester have at the end of that game? Chelsea was all over us yet they only score from a fluke deflection.  Joel was great against West Ham, but for his clean sheets he didn't have as much to do.

We need to press and keep their offense away from us by putting OUR offense in their final 3rd.  Offense can be a good defense because not only do you keep it away from them, but if you're ahead, it forces them to panic and change their offensive tactics as the game goes on, making it easier on our defense.  Right now, we don't have that offense - we just let them fire away or create pressure on us.

You can have the best goalkeeper in the world but if they're constantly under pressure, eventually the wall breaks.  He was lights out against Belgium, and they still got 2 in because they just kept coming while the US offense only decided to show up in the last 15 minutes.

It took him two weeks to describe a linked list, and after one week of recursion he decided now would be a good time to watch him wait for his recursive factorial function to calculate 45!. Not to mention the fact that he told us straight-facedly that we would be using an old version of Java with no justification.

I want to be challenged, I don't want to turn up to a scheduled two-hour practical and finish the pitiful excuse for an exercise in five minutes.

Having grown up with reruns of DW my whole life, I loved Ecclestons portrayal. I thoroughly enjoyed McGanns in the movie (still haven't gotten around to the audio). Tennants was hit or miss depending on the writer (he was a little too manic at times for me). And Smith was great for a long time, with a few dips here and there. Hurt was more brooding than whimsy, but he delivered the humour just right when necessary.

But I really, really want to like Capaldi. He's got the *potential* to encapsulate everything I love about the Doctor, he just needs better scripts and story arcs. I have high hopes, but I'm also worried he's going to suffer from bad writing and be seen in a bad light.

I've also finally come to terms with the idea of having a non white-male Doctor so long as they can find the right person (and keep them British!).

I assume you mean the Big Finish audios, which are mostly like radio plays as opposed to actual audiobooks.  And yes they all follow the adventures of previous Doctors!  An excellent way to get more of Doctors who had tragically short televised runs like 6 and 8.  The first 50 of these stories (4-part 30min episodes) cost 2.99 each on the Big Finish website.  I would start with the Eighth Doctor episode Storm Warning, and move forward from there.  This line actually follows a particular order, whereas some of the other Doctors stories jump around in their timeline from one episode to the next.

For the Capital One Cup game on Sunday, Tottenham , I feel, will be not be 100% knowing that they played in the Europa League a few days before the final.. Chelsea will have all the motivation in the world to win a trophy, though anything can happen in a final.

For the Premier League, yes we have a chance and 5 points is nothing becz we won it from behind before with bigger deficits. But it's just too much of an ask this time around.. We have not clicked into our amazing goal-scoring form at home like last season.. We also dropped some points against lower opponents (Burnley, Hull). Again, anything can happen in the Premier League, but Chelsea are in such a good form in the League at the moment it's hard to imagine them dropping so many more points for us to climb up. 

As for the Champions League we've got no chance.. Sorry for my pessimism but we're just not good enough to win such a massive competition.. We need players of high quality in every or almost every position.. (No players like Fernando should be playing on such huge European occasions. he's just not good enough). 

Finally, We've gotta find a quality replacement for Yaya Toure.. It's just so sad to realize that we were about the same points with Chelsea before he left to AFCON.. and as soon as he left, we slipped up so much, the creativity from midfield is gone.. Players like Fernando and Fernandino are just happy to pass it sideways or to Silva and Nasri, they won't take charge and make something brilliant happen like Yaya would do..

Would you say that oppenents of interracial marriage back in the 1960s America were simply worried about the insitituion of marriage and weren't in anyway racist? Not allowing a proportion of the population to marry the person that they love is simply unjust.

7% of LGBT people not supporting SSM isn't that surprising.

Resorting to cheap tactics of trying to associate Hamas with ISIS when they are two very different organisations in different countries, with different historical baggage does nothing but discredit your argument.

The Gaza conflict is historical and territorial, the result of our - the British - fucking around in the region and has more in common with Northern Ireland and it's relation to the UK than it does with ISIS, Iraq or the rest of the Middle East.

Palestinians are not all Muslim, there are plenty of Christians there too, possibly some atheists amongst them. This is a not a Holy War that is taking place, it's a more traditional terrorism in the form of freedom fighting than anything. There are antagonists on both sides but it's not religiously motivated.

Playing Kane with Soldado hasn't worked at all lately.  Kane doesn't play as a striker when we do, and we need him to.  I don't know if that's on Poch or Kane, but it needs to stop.  

I don't like pulling Bentaleb, either.  If you're going to pull him for rest, then don't bother adding Kane.  He was hands down our best midfielder, and I thought our best player.

Lamela, Eriksen, and Chadli didn't do much of anything.  Lamela played in Soldado and had that nice volley early on, but didn't add much.  Chadli had the odd appearance, but didn't add much either.  Eriksen didn't have much impact either.  Invisible for the most part, and that applies to everyone.

Benji was okay, but didn't have much going on.  Bentaleb was great I thought.  

Chiriches put in some solid crosses, but overall didn't really do much.  Shaky at times.  Same for Davies, who seemed very hesitant to go forward a little too much.

Apart from his slip up, Vert was pretty good, or at least not bad.  Fazio terrifirs me with how little ability he has to change directions.  I'm not sure I'd back him in a race against Merteseacker.  Though I'd take him in a fight.

Soldado was as invisible as the attacking mids other than his mistake, which was awful.  But I don't knock attackers for mistakes as much as I do defenders.  Different situations and all that.

OK Cardiff is a great city with lots of open space, yet still remaining relatively compact  to get around.  I don't know what kind of stuff you are into so here's a selection off the top of my head.If you come back to with some interests I'll try and be more specific.

First up would be Cardiff Castle, a stones throw from the Stadium.  It was created by renowned architect William Burges for the third Marquis of Bute, who was reputedly the richest man in the world at the time.  Check out the elaborate gargoyles along the walls.  Wrapped around the Castle you'll also find Bute Park, 130 acres of landscaped gardens. ""A rambling riverside beauty spot with an arboretum, Victorian gardens, friary ruins and a cafe""

A few miles outside the city you'll find St Fagans National History Museum. Over 40 buildings, from an Iron Age Celtic village to a row of ironworkers’ houses have been painstakingly rebuilt in 60 acres of beautiful gardens.  Worth the trip to eat Bara Brith - a traditional Welsh fruit and tea cake - hot from the oven at the in museum bakery.

The National Museum right in the civic centre has a stunning collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. (All museums in Wales have free entry)

A trip to Cardiff Bay will allow you to see the Wales Millennium Centre - the centre of music and theatre. Alongside many waterside restaurants. You can also take a boat trip along the river Taff. Or a fast boat ride out to the Cardiff Barrage. There's also the Cardiff International White Water Centre, where you can get very wet.  If you're feeling geeky there's the Dr Who Experience as well as a few landmarks from Torchwood.

How's that?

Tell me how long are you staying and what are you interested in if you want more.

if you TRY and take them to court with a lawyer, the judge will first ask one question which will be 'why havent you gone to a tribunal?' and then they will laugh at you and you will lose a lot of money. You are first OBLIGED to go to a tribunal, with or without a lawyer for matters relating to unfair dismisaal. If you don't do that first, you get thrown out of court AND charged for wasting the courts time.

The fees for that tribunal are as mentioned. You cannot not pay them. you cant pass them onto your lawyer. You owe them, and you have to pay them to force an employer to obey their legal obligations if they will not.

&gt;It'd be nice if secondary schools taught more programming but I don't think that's any excuse for the painfully slow programming course. I and many of my friends never had previous experience before queens and we all felt it was too slow. They spent like two weeks going over FOR loops for crying out loud (and never even covered FOREACH).

It has gotten a bit better in the last year or so I think. The pace has quickened from when I did it. They were covering things in the first semester my year didn't touch till second year. At the same time when you do some demonstrating at practicals you see there are still plenty who struggle quite a bit to wrap their heads around things like FOR loops when seeing them for the first time. Going faster could lead to more drop outs and that's probably it's own debate there.

When you look at the strength in depth that top teams such as Real or Bayern have, Chelsea are still a way off. Mourinho prefers not to rotate too much in midfield, but that's partially due to there being a distinct 'top 3'. Who else in the squad comes close to the ability of Matic, Fabregas or Oscar for those positions? However, with 4 players like Matic, Pogba, Oscar and Fabregas available for 3 midfield positions he can mix and match the right blend of midfield talent to match the opponent. Or rotate players without a major drop in quality. Oscar would still get plenty of games.

As far as youth talent goes, that's an entirely different kettle of fish. Youth players will get regular first team football at Chelsea *if and only if* they prove themselves to be up to ""Chelsea standard"". Which, if we are to aim for the top, means ""world class"". Having an extra player in midfield won't change that.

... and with regards losing players - it's never easy to lose a much loved player (e.g. Mata), but if it improves the team and boosts finances then it has to be done.

The likelihood is this means rotating players because of the number of games, and the slim margins between success and failure.  As in, two key players being tired can kill Spurs' chances of winning.  Is the problem them trying to win every game, or is it, in fact, the case that we haven't got a good enough squad (the first 11 is pretty good, if not flawless), despite major investment and Academy successes.  And yes, thanks to Bale the balance sheet looks good, but I really don't care about Spurs plc's P&amp;L, I want goals and wins.

First everyone excused him because he was new to the league - alright fair enough. Then because he wasn't getting enough service - true our system under AVB was lacking. Then the miscarrage, I think it was? - absolutely, had all the support he could ask for and we gladly gave it. Since then it's ""confidence"" - he'll turn it around when he has a chance. 

When do we stop blaming everything else, and realize that he's just not right for us? It seems like the goals he has scored have been flukes. Not in terms of quality - but in terms of not indicative of consistent performances at all.

Said it before and I'll say it again - dont see what he has brought to the team, on a consistent basis, in the last season and a half.

WW2 the allies were more moral because we lost ~6 times the number of people right?  Nothing else to it at all?

Ok that's very facetious, but you can see my point I hope.

As it appears to me, the first blood, so to speak, was made by us (the international community) giving land, that didn't belong to us, to a new state, out of WW2 guilt or whatever.

Then the two sides didn't get along.  One side time and time again has started violence.  That isn't to say illegal settling and the like wasn't happening, but that violence was started.

I don't think it's fair to blame Isreal for the outcome of a war they didn't start.  Sure, we should scrutinise the conduct of any army in any war, but we should also have perspective on it.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"here's my problem here guys. Lovren's penalty was piss-poor. We all know that, but he's a defender. Here's the issue I have.

Not a single fucking solitary player other than Lovren had the fucking balls to step up and take that last penalty. I'm not suggesting the fact he's a defender is why he **shouldn't** be taking the penalty. I'm catagorically saying that Lovren has had an absolutely fucking atrocious start to his Liverpool career. He knows it, the staff know it, the players know it. So why the fucking shit isn't somebody putting their hand in the air and stopping the man who is under more scrutiny and pressure than anyone else at the club from taking a crucial final penalty? Moreno has bags of confidence. Toure has experience. Even Mignolet has regained confidence of late. But I'm looking at Sterling here.

I want to know why Sterling, one of our three attack-minded players still on the pitch, isn't stepping up to say ""boss, I'm taking this last one."" because there's no fucking way if he does that Brendan says ""Nah Razza, Lovren's got this.""

They were dirty, they were aggressive and quite frankly made the match really hard for me to watch personally, but they showed more bollocks and more passion in this match than we did and to be honest, they probably deserve it. 

Some of our players need to take some responsibility and a backbone. I have respect for Lovren for showing the guts to take a penalty but his career here is finished, that's him done now.

Going faster could lead to more drop outs and that's probably it's own debate there.

Part of the problem behind this is completely outside of the university's control. I've been a demonstrator at the school now for almost 5 years. In that time I've seen a significant drop in the ability of students to think for themselves. The current school system seems to encourage rote learning in all subjects, even in science or mathematical based subjects. When the students arrive at uni now, they are still expecting to be drip fed the answer, and quite a few are able to bluff their way through first year without understanding the ""advanced"" concepts like FOR loops passing the content by copy/pasting from their notes or exercises. By the time this becomes evident in second year, there is little which can be done except slow down the content until they start to get their heads around it.

I had a depressing moment today when a final year student who I demonstrate a module for rolled their eyes when I asked them what they had done to try and resolve their problem and had they checked Google. I had another one earlier in the week when grading some projects for second years, where the module content contained everything required to get a 2:1 and a 1st required only a little bit of original thinking.

null,false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;During that period there was little or no middle class in the modern sense.

But that's the point though, there was no middle class ""in the modern sense"".

At the time you're talking about society was structured differently, and it's very simplistic to basically just say ""Well you have all the nobles, and then you have the peasants. Yup that's it!"".

The nobles would own some land that they would make money off, but they in turn would have a liege that may or may not be the king (depending on how high they were in the pecking order) who would then demand taxes and men off them.

No, there wasn't a ""modern"" middle class, because these guys were the middle class of the time. Not all of them were even very rich in comparison to the King and his immediate court.

The point is that in any of these revolutions, it's not the bottom class, the majority of the people, who lead and spur on the revolution, they just fight in it.

In the Baron's Wars the lesser nobles who were the equivalent of the middle class at the time organised their armies to try and fight the king. Same with the Scottish Independence wars. 

I'm not personally aware of any revolution that consisted solely of the working classes.

Hypothetically there could be some sort of coup where the nobles dethrone each other and only nobles are involved, but that's not really a revolution as they aren't trying to change the established order much, just who is in charge of it.

As for the success of the Baron Wars we could argue that back and forth, but ultimately the Magna Carta was only really pulled out occasionally. John only agreed to sign it because he was weak at the time, as soon as he had money and armies he totally ignored it. Even if he didn't the Barons weren't looking to change the political system, they still wanted a king and the landed gentry, they basically just wanted the King to stop doing specific things.

No, I'd include them. I think they'd be hard pressed to agree that such sentences represented justice. I think they'd say that their hands are constrained by sentencing guidelines and that 14 months for each person you tried to kill is somewhat lenient. At least that has been my experience.

&gt; And you still seem to have picked up a rather arbitrary length of 6/5 years per victim as a boundary. Where does that number come from?

Not sure where you get that figure from, I was talking about the actual time that would be served. I explained my reasoning earlier taking into account existing sentencing guidelines. Sure, precedent may be that sentences run concurrently but it isn't the law that they must and I can't imagine that once new precedent was set there would be any problems with it being applied mroe widely.

We were in Ft. Lauderdale over the New Year's, and watched the Chelsea game in [Fox and Hounds](https://www.facebook.com/foxandhoundsFTL) - the woman tending the bar was an Arsenal fan, Chelsea fans on one side of the pub, we on another side.

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"I never expected to win this match.  Scoring away at Fiorentina, much less mutiple goals, was always a big ask.  We lost this tie last week.

The biggest issue for me after today is that Eriksen played the full 90.  Other than that, everyone who will play on Sunday was rested for much or all of the match.  And even Eriksen ended up playing in central midfield, and seemed to be conserving his energy.  So overall, I think the rotation was mostly handled well by Pochettino.

This may have been Soldado's last match for us.  We have a midweek match against Swansea 3 days after the League Cup final, but then it's all weekends for the rest of the season.  So Kane will play Sunday, Ade might play Wednesday, and then it's all Kane until summer.

Soldado's error today wasn't any worse than countless others he's made in his time here.  He's just a poor forward for us.  I do agree with smokey815, though, I still think he adds more to the team than Adebayor has this season.  Which just illustrates how *absolutely moribund* our strike corps is after Kane.  This was a major failing by the club during the January window.

It's interesting to me that, earlier in the season, we often looked our best with both Kane and Soldado on the pitch.  Now, we look awful with them in tandem.  Indicates how much our playstyle within Pochettino's system has evolved over the course of the season.

But not the people who are responsible for precedents like sentences being served concurrently. It's all well and good saying someone deserve a 12 year sentence for this, a nine year sentence for that and an 11 year sentence for the other, but when the total is the largest number rather than the sum then no individual member of the sentencing council would be able to legitimately claim justice was being served, particularly if the offences in question were committed against multiple persons.

The less than one and a fifth years was the likely time to be served by the worst perpetrator per member of the family he attacked with a baseball bat. I understood from the article that the family had four members, if I recall incorrectly and there were more, then the sentence per person he attempted to kill is diminished further.

Sentences can indeed be served consecutively and certainly the interests of justice are served better when an individual who has broken multiple laws pays for all of them rather than simply whichever has the longest sentence.

First up, in case you didn't know, you can't really take ""straight physics"" in Cambridge. It offers a Natural Sciences course instead, with various modules taken in the first year which you gradually narrow down.

For example, though I applied to do physics in other universities, if I go to Cambridge I really want to take Physics, Mathematics A, Earth Sciences and Computer Science. A full list of first year modules can be found here:

http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/natsci/part1a.html

As someone else has said, your choice of college has very little to do with the quality of you education, especially for a subject as popular as natural sciences.  Lectures are given on a univeristy-wide basis, and supervisions (small group teaching) are given once or twice a week in your college by the fellows. 

The main thing to think about when picking a college isn't your subject, but the way you want to live in Cambridge. Do you want to be in a large or small community? Do you want an old college with quirky traditions, or a modern college with newer buildings? How centrally do you want to live? These are all far more important.

Here is a page which allows you to browse the pros and come of the colleges. It was what finally allowed to chose to apply to Magdalene!

He's in his third season with us, the first season of which was transition, the second of which we played marvelously and the third of which we have been up and down due to player departures and injuries. 

Another reason is that this is only his second taste of European football, it would be extremely naive to assume same tactics apply in Europe and it's an aspect that he needs to work on. One thing Brendan has showed us though is how adept he is at adapting our style of play to get results. I'm confident he'll manage this in Europe soon within the next few years and we will manage at the very least a decent run.

The cups will come when the stability does, which it will due to the nature of our young squad. Losing to Besiktas is not like losing to Accrington Stanley; they are a good side with an absolutely menacing home atmosphere who are used to consistent European qualification.

null,false,196884,null,null,null,"i  think  you have to take into account the performance of the team and the system they are asked to play in before saying he lacks presence and passing. Even Coutinho couldn't thread a pass if our players are not giving him the options.

Rodgers got it so wrong this game. He set up 3 CB and had the 2FB sit back to defend, and hope play on the counter. But then he got cute and put Balo and Studge up.  Which makes the midfield a bit light, so the FB had too much to cover to make up for the lack of width when you play 2 up front and 1 #10, which means they don't get to the wide areas fast enough (notice how many passes to the wide areas and Ibe/Moreno are not quite there yet). 

Allen had one of those games where he just got crowded out -- Besiktas figured out in the 2nd half that their #10 area (allen) can be overloaded. That's when we got found out. The 3CB defended well -- it did took a lucky deflection and a great goal for Besiktas to score. But we *cannot get the ball out of defense* into the feet of the front 3. Emre Can was basically trying to do two jobs : help Allen in the overloaded CDM area, *and* become the link with Sterling et al. Of course he is not going to look too good, but he was given an impossible task by Rodgers.

What Rodgers sohuld have done is to take out Studge/Balo, and put in Lallana, and revert to a 3-4-2-1 with Sterling/Lallana playing the dual #10s like we normally play. This way, we cover the width better in the CM area. Without another CM on the bench, he can't switch Can to CB to link up with the CM, but if Lallana comes in, he takes some of Can's load in CM, and Can can drop deeper to help out CB and get the ball out of defense.

Poor performance from Rodgers to be honest. But he'll learn.

We're probably going to be traveling on a tight budget - the rugby ticket and transportation/accomodation already burned holes in our wallets - so boat rides and event stuff like the White Water Centre are probably out of the question. We're currently planning to stay in the Cardiff area for an extended weekend, somewhere between 3 and 5 nights in total, and then get on the road and see some more of Wales and possibly south England. Game evenings will be spent in pubs watching the games of course!

The Castle and National History Museum sound great! I'm not sure if we'll be in the mood for art - but we're all definitely interested in learning what we can about welsh history and culture while we're there!

Advice for cheap, good value eateries or good pubs is also definitely welcome, as is advice about which local food we have to try. And also which local beer we have to try - we're Germans after all ;)

&gt;there was one move in the second half when Sterling pressured the fullback into passing the ball sideways. The player who received it was right in front of Balotelli and he didn't even press him. Sturridge may of messed up a few chances by running the ball too much, or having a bad touch but at least he got into those positions. Balotelli never even had a chance to score. And that's without discussing the card he got in the opening 10 minutes.

The fact that he scored so consistently after getting back from injury only adds to the expectation from the fans and from himself, resulting in more pressure that he may have ever had in his life, all after being out for as long as he was.

I may have been a little surprised when I eventually realized Sturridge had been on the field the whole time I'd been watching, but I think with a bit more time and continued support/patience, he'll be back (and maybe better than ever).

What I find amusing about this article is that it debunks the idea all students (that read this newspaper) bring their cars to University. I can believe this because in a city like Bristol, there's little point due to public transport.

What it doesn't debunk is that  rubbish and disruption is exactly what will be brought from student housing. More people in an enclosed area will generate more rubbish and more noise, it's hard to argue otherwise unless these folks are living in a library next to a recycling centre. 

I feel for the residents because it'll probably affect their house prices and they'll have to put up with stuff they didn't have to. I'm not sure how the language is harsh, might be if you're a good student who behaves themselves but if you've lived in student halls before, you know you've had a couple of nights where the fire alarm wakes everybody up, or there's some absolute bellend blasting out Mr Brightside (it's a tune to be fair) when they're coming home from the pubs n clubs. Sooo you sort of know a lot of what they've said to be true, you've just blocked out the horrific fire alarm at 4am before an exam memories... (Seriously, fuck fire alarms)

But I'm also aware of how shocking the situation with housing in Bristol for students is, so something has to give. I've heard stories of lecturers having to take students into their homes because there's no where for them to live! 

My opinion to fixing the issue is to develop further out and invest in campuses for accommodation, with all the facilities students need and a bus route that can take them to and from the city.

But I don't think that's what is being done. As far as I can tell, the 24% figure hasn't been hushed up or skirted around, and I certainly haven't seen any popular media outlets that are accepting of it. And while 24% of people may believe violent acts can be justified, 68% don't. Tarring all of those people with the same brush goes beyond feelings of offense; it makes the whole situation worse. It appears its becoming increasingly acceptable to marginalise Muslims in particular because of some of the more conservative/extreme views held by a minority, which is only ever going to alienate moderate Muslims further and make the extreme views more commonplace.

The 24% figure is pretty appalling, but to be honest if you were to ask an analagous question to British society as a whole, I'm sure the result would be similarly disheartening. One in three people in our society acknowledge that they are racially-prejudiced, and while it's not quite at the same level as promoting violence for a difference in opinion, that's quite at odds with the idealised image of British society that exists in my head.

I'm weak as fuck. I'm confident I won't be able to defend myself. I also in an area where a lot of rough people live (Irish gypsies, absolute cocks).  

One night, I was walking my friend home from the pub because he was smashed. I was slightly tipsy, I managed to sober up. On my way to my house, 3 fucking gypsies with bikes had me against the wall and head butted me. They were asking for a walk down the lane. Luckily, a couple walked passed in the empty street. I asked for help because I was being assaulted and the 3 cunts fled where they can from. All because I accidentally bumped into one of them in the shop earlier when I was a bit drunk.  

Because they're one big family clan thing, they all live in one region estate. From that one incident, their cousins or brothers or what have you see me as an enemy from that really small incident And I have to walk past it every morning to get to my college. Sometimes I stay there later so I'm walking passed it in the night.  
Basically I'm scared of this... I don't want to say gang. They're more of close families of absolute twats in an area. I need protection.  
I could go to the police, they're already trouble for them but I feel like I'd be more paranoid if they found out I reported them to the police. Keep in my mind I live quite close to them, so it's relatively easy for them to find out where I live (hence the home intruder use of the weapon).   

If I had a Karambit, it's very menacing and deadly looking knife. I would honestly use it more as a scare tactic. Actually using it for its purpose is the last thing I want to do.

In terms of the universities, I have many friends at all 3.

For historical-ness and a ""small-city"" feel, York may be your best one. But I think the UK definition of small city is different to the U.S. one. 

From what my friends have told me, the student life in York isn't all that great, and while it is a very interesting city (especially for a history student), it's not got that much for typical ""studenty"" things.

I've visited friends at Exeter and I really like it, although there's less historical sites, the night life is good. To me that has the feel of a ""small-city"" perhaps more so than york. There's more to do (in my opinion) for students.

Bristol is similar to Exeter, except it's a larger city.

My personal issue with all of them is I feel they're incredibly pretentious, and I don't like the atmosphere or the vibe the students give off. Most of them are wealthy and posh and snobbish. Not to say they're not nice people...just not the type of people Id want to be living with for 3-4 years.

But more seriously...

&gt;The main difference is the average Palestinians would rather they didn't as they get murdered for it

Really?

&gt;Support for suicide bombing and other violence aimed at civilian targets is most widespread in the Palestinian territories, with 62% of Muslims saying that such attacks are often or sometimes justified in order to defend Islam from its enemies. Support is strong both in Hamas-ruled Gaza (64%) and the Fatah-governed West Bank (60%).

http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/09/10/muslim-publics-share-concerns-about-extremist-groups/

But... Let's look at something specific here.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/09/02/poll-hamas-popularity-surges-after-war-with-israel/

&gt;A new poll appears to show that support for Hamas has surged among Palestinians – in spite of (or perhaps due to) a huge Israeli military operation that battered Gaza and left many of the militant group's fighters dead.

&gt;It's a stark shift. If presidential elections were held today with just the two top candidates, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) found that 61 percent of Palestinians would vote for the militant's leader Ismail Haniyeh over current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. That's a big increase over a poll conducted in June, which found that 53 percent supported Abbas and 41 percent supported Haniyeh. PCPSR note that it's the first time that Haniyeh has received a majority in the eight years they have asked the question.

&gt;The sudden shift in support seems to be a direct result of the recent war with Israel that left thousands of Palestinians and dozens of Israelis dead. Despite the huge destruction wrought in the Gaza Strip, the poll found many Palestinians were supportive of how Hamas handled the conflict. Ninety-four percent of those polled said they were satisfied with Hamas' military engagement of Israeli troops, and 86 percent supported the firing of rockets into Israeli. Remarkably, 79 percent said that Hamas had ""won"" the conflict. These results support on-the-ground reporting from The Post's Sudarsan Raghavan, who noted that ""virtually every Palestinian interviewed during the hostilities praised the militants’ fight against Israel"" in mid-August.

Notice the words surge, stark shift and sudden shift? So previously before this, with the Qassam rockets Hamas was losing popularity, a lot of it, it supports your argument then, but then after? A lot of support went to from zero to massive, why? Because it is to Hamas' benefit to keep on poking the Israeli bear and get them to overreact. These attacks and the resulting fallout keeps Hamas in power, which is why Hamas does it. Is Israel to blame for a disproportionate response to the provocation? Yes. Is Hamas to blame for provoking Israel in the first place? Yes. There is no difference at all, they're feeding off each other so trying to paint one side as an oppressed underdog is flat out dishonest (not saying the Palestinians and Hamas aren't the underdogs here, but come on it's not like they actually give a fuck). Hamas knows exactly what it is doing and the consequences of it, which is what? Super high levels of support in the Palestinian population.

Tons of things to do here all year but it can go up a few notches at certain times so depends when you are planning on visiting. Personally I'd suggest climbing Arthur's Seat (via  St Anthony's chapel) for an amazing view of the city and the coast..would be a bit nippy this time of year though. The museum is a must especially now its just been refurbed. There are the usual touristy things, castle, palace, art galleries, churches..tons of info on that. We have a beach but sod that this time of year. I think the best thing to do is just walk around and take in the city, you will stumble across your own little gems, its a great city to just discover quirky and odd things.

The [first thread I went into](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2x94lg/inside_gazas_tunnels_militants_get_ready_for_next/) and the highest voted opinions are 1; condemning P for using $ on weapons not 'attracting major businesses' (lol), 2; P should stop 'jihad' and learn to be peaceful with Israel. 3; 'they hate jews more than they love themselves'. Meanwhile one post asking what the west will do when Israel announces further settlements is heavily downvoted [it is these kind of responses that are most indicative for me.. usually comments like this, that do not present a strong opinion, even if they are leaning against 'hivemind' opinion won't usually be downvoted much below -1], and a (somewhat non-sequitur) reply 'what settlements' is heavily upvoted. Reddit used to be heavily anti-Israeli; of course this changes as reddit has grown, but I don't believe such a level of change has occurred organically.

And even if you don't subscribe to my view- I think people here are really underestimating the effect shills can have on public opinion online. And reddit is a really prime system to game. It's easy to paint issues such as Is./Pa. in differing lights, and you'd only need ~20 accounts or so that were very active to have a really strong impact on what the narrative being discussed is in most threads.. (more in the most popular ones, but not hard, and they hold the biggest prize). Eventually, the 'real' people (painted by the votes as holding unpopular, 'wrong' opinions) get fed up of fighting and the control hardens to the shills, meanwhile, due to constantly being exposed to one side of the story real users start to buy into it, and do the work of the shills for them.

Personally i think the only difference is that Lamela is young and has room to grow. Soldado can still be a decent player, elsewhere, but his best days are behind him and he seems a husk of his former self - just like Torres was at Chelsea.

Lamela has flare, and he tracks back well usually, but we didn't pay 30m quid for one rabona and some scrappy tackles. I'd keep him, for now, but i think it's becoming increasingly obvious that he isn't 30m quid worth of player. Teams don't fear him and he's a liability as much as a threat in possession.

In Pyramids of Mars, the fourth Doctor tells Sarah Jane he is 750 or so.  I believe the seventh Doctor is the first to claim to be 900 years old, a number he likes throwing around until Series 6 of the revival.  My favorite headcannon explanation for why he claims 900 for so long is that when the 7th and 8th doctors claim to be 900 or so, they mean Gallifreyan years, and when the 9th 10th and 11th do so, they mean Earth years, since Gallifrey has been destroyed and he has more or less adopted Earth as his de facto home.  

I think that the real reason is that 900 just sounds good.  Its a long time, but is specific enough to sound believable.  Claiming to be 1000 years old sound like hyperbole or an estimation.  I believe this is why the Eleventh Doctor claims to be 1100 when he returns from his avoidance of Lake Silencio.  

I believe the most recent reference to his age was at the end of Deep Breath when he tells Clara he is over 2000.

The most conclusive evidence from the show comes in The Day of the Doctor, when his previous incarnations ask  how old he is, and Eleven says something to the effect of ""1200 and something, unless I'm lying.  I'm so old I can't even remember if I'm lying about my age."" 

And really, how could he remember?  He doesn't stay in one place long enough to be able to keep track.  There is no calendar for him to reference, and he has got so much else to worry about that it would be a real waste of his mental abilities to spend time considering his age.

I'm a student too, and I had this exact same problem. I didn't really want to quit smoking as I quite enjoyed the act of it, but I also didn't want to face the health issues posed by smoking, nor the monetary issues.

My solution was the e-cigarette. On the surface they may not seem cheaper, but trust me, they are.

I suggest spending a little more than you want to get the starting stuff, I'd recommend a Variable voltage ego battery and a Aspire Nautilus. That probably sounds like gibberish to you, but have a look and see if there is a Smokers Angel near you, if you pop in and say you're looking for that, they'll have it as well as enough juice to last you around 2 weeks for £42. From that point on you will buy juice and coils (for the nautilus), replacing them about once every 2 weeks, and the juice costing £1 for 10ml (about a weeks worth for me anyway) from onepoundliquid, give them a Google.

If you need any further advice you can PM me or join us over at /r/ecr_eu - which is a vaping community for those of us in Europe.

Keep the money in the bank. Keep records of your attempts to contact him.

Under UK law he can't just throw you out. He has to go through legally required procedures so you won't find yourself homeless at a moments notice. 

He can apply for a Section 8 for non payment of rent. This would go to a county court where you can then prove you have the money to pay and have tried to pay. His application for a Section 8 would then be thrown out. 

He can apply for a Section 21 ""no fault notice"". This requires him to give two full months notice.

This is purely civil and would be sorted in a county court if it came to it. You would not get a criminal record for something that goes to county court.

We have to start Gomis after his adequate performance last week. (just seems like he was Messi when compared to his form going into it) If, and this is a HUGE IF, we can get Gomis going we should crush Burnley. Our midfield is top quality with Ki, Cork and Siggy all being Top 7 caliber players and with Naughton in the squad our defense has looked incredibly solid.

Burnley's defenders have actually been quite good this season. Trippier, Shackell, Keane and Mee make up a solid backline that is left to dry by an incredibly weak midfield. We need to make the space in front of the defence our own and get Siggy situated there. If Siggurdson gets into a comfortable position in front of their defenders we could see a rout. That said Ings HAS to be first priority when they attack. We need Cork back there to snuff out the counter and I think if he man marks him on the counter Burnley will have no bite. From what I've seen of Burnley we need to make sure Ings never gets too far from Ash in the box as well, great talent they've got up top.

Cautiously optimistic for this one. Come on Monk lets head to White Hart Lane with some wind under our sails!

Eriksen is the one I'm most worried about.  He hasn't shone for a while lately, and looks in need of a rest, not a potentially gruelling cup final against Chelsea.  He's been our sole creative voice this season, and has the potential to win games single-handedly.  Without him on top form, we stand a much lesser chance of winning.

I've said it before on here, but Poch's biggest failing so far was letting handy squad players like Siggy, Holtby and Lennon go without replacing them.  How I would've loved to have seen those three line up against Fiorentina so others could've gotten a rest...

EDIT: I'll also add, Dembele's only played 45 mins huh?  That can only mean one of two things... either Poch is planning on starting him (and putting Eriksen out left again), or he's lost faith in Mousa after some lacklustre performances.

99% of the time when drivers stop to let someone cross the road, it doesn't benefit anyone. The pedestrian could have crossed quicker if the car had just carried on. It takes virtually no time to pass a standing pedestrian and get out of their way, whereas stopping, waiting for the pedestrian to check you've really stopped for them etc wastes everyones time. Also, having stopped for the pedestrian, you may pressure that pedestrian to cross quicker than they otherwise would have.

Why would a pedestrian assume the driver had stopped so she could cross, even though continuing on would make more sense? Why did a pedestrian then cross quickly without checking properly, even though she had clearly stopped and looked before that driver stopped? Maybe it wouldn't have happened if drivers didn't ""generously"" stop to let pedestrians cross so often.
