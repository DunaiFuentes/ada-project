It's nice to see that he's against faith schools too. His religion does seem to come into play in other areas though. I'm on my lunch and don't have time to write in detail, so I'll just copy and paste a previous comment I've made discussing this in more detail:

Tim Farron is a secularist, and want's a separation of church and state, as most Lib Dem's do. Here are his [own words](http://scottish-liberal.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/tim-farron-on-faith-and-politics.html) on his religious views. However there are a few things his religious views obviously do influence. Bills limiting [abortion, euthanasia and embryology](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Tim_Farron&amp;mpc=Westmorland_and_Lonsdale&amp;house=commons&amp;dmp=813) are something he voted for, more often than not (he was 69% against these issues according to the public whip).

There's also the issue of him [abstaining from the third reading of the gay marriage bill](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/17/tim-farron-regrets-abstention-gay-marriage-vote). He now regrets it, but at the time he didn't vote for it because he feared for religious minorities.

Lastly there's the issue of the [letter he signed, that went to the ASA](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html). He now regret's that too and I'm inclined to believe his account, although as it says he still disagrees with the ASA's ruling. 

Whilst I tend to be rather anti-religion , I'm not too concerned about his faith. I'm going to be voting for Lamb, but that's more to do with me being a centrist and Lamb's political experience. As I've said Farron appears to be a secularist when all's said and done, and whilst I'm very much in favour of liberal abortion, embryology and euthanasia laws (as well as being against alternative medicine/healing), Farron's stances on those issues don't factor too much in my decision.

null,false,ArtistEngineer,null,null,null,"I'm Australian, been here a total of 5 years over the last 2 decades.

I did the Holiday Working visa thing in 1997/98 and I lived in London. I recommend you get a Holiday Working visa as well as that will give you maximum flexibility.

After doing a degree in Mechatronics, I did 18 months of fulltime work as an embedded Software Engineer in Australia. When I arrived in the UK, I applied for contractor positions, and I had a couple jobs lasting a total of about 12 months.  I lived the good life in London, and I commuted out to Luton and Reading on a daily basis for my work. This wasn't bad because I got to be in London for the nightlife, and the trains aren't crowded when you move against the commuter flow.

The pay was pretty good for the UK at that time. Unfortunately, wages haven't changed much. Contractors wages for ""normal"" IT work is about £40/hr. The hourly rate I got back in 1997/98 wasn't much less.

You can get a LOT more money if you work in something like financial [HFT ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading). 

Fulltime wages are pretty bad compared to Australia. In Australia/America, you should be looking at a 6 figure after a few years out of University. I know some very clever people who got offers of $140K+ from Google in Sydney.

I'd aim for £50K, but accept down to £40K. If you think you're worth it, then you've got nothing to lose by trying to sell yourself.

**EDIT:** The Australian dollar is one of the most volatile currencies in the World.  One day your wage will seem great, the next it will look like crap. Try not to compare £ to $ if you start working here. It will do your head in.

I use http://technojobs.co.uk and http://reed.co.uk. There's also http://jobserve.co.uk.

The work density in the UK is very different to Australia. Work is spread out all over the country, but there are definite ""hot spots"", mostly centred around the cities.  You should be able to get decent IT work around most cities.  Some cities deal more with service industries, and some more with engineering R&amp;D - likewise the type of IT varies considerably. 

I live and work in Cambridge, there is a lot of work here. It's got good road and rail connections to London, and it is bicycle friendly if you like that sort of thing.  Cambridge has very high house prices.

House prices ... it's not much different to Australia except that house prices don't go down as you look out of the towns. In fact, ""country houses"" are REALLY expensive here. House prices are mostly dictated by proximity to work centres and transport links. 

Here are two essential tools for looking at houses:

Wrong. It's always been a big problem, it's just an even bigger problem when the party that's most likely to leave people starving on the street forms a ""majority"" when only 25% of the electorate actually voted for them.


Politicians are cunts, but the tories are worse.

In order for us to have a government that actually fairly represents the people, I think we need to do away with this whole ""winning/losing"" crap. It's supposed to be a system for us to decide the formation of the government, which affects almost every part of most peoples every day lives. Instead, it seems to have become some sick and perverse competition for who can get the most votes, with the prize being a position of a lot of power.

If we're going to have this stupid party system, I'd much rather have parties that work together and are willing to compromise with each other to come up with the best solution to the issue at hand, instead of the current pissing contest where everyone blindly takes their parties side and does everything they can to fuck over the other sides proposals.",null,0,null,1432210682,null,0,false,0,crg96t5,null,t3_36qhad,null,t1_crg96t5,null,t1_crg8g6n,null,null,null,1433186523,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Totally agree. The speed limit is set for a reason but it's important to be able to judge the best speed as well. I learned to drive in a rural area so this was drilled into me pretty early on and it's also the reason the National limit is different for different vehicles.

There are areas where the limit seems weird, and it's usually because there has been a fatal or significant accident that has prompted change. Not always, but that is often the case.

When you get to 70 areas, going ten miles over the speed limit isn't as bad as doing so in residential areas.

Fining a company absolutely does punish management as it hurts their main performance metrics, and shareholders absolutely do recognise that. Also, the fine is coming out of retained earnings in equity so shareholders are already being fined. The fine is ALREADY being effectively paid by shareholders. The fine is £1.5bn not ""a few million"", and shareholders are obviously taking notice as that's wiped out a significant portion of post tax profit. What you would propose is to fine them, and then keep fining them until a fairly arbitrary measure falls by another arbitrary amount.

It's because we have governments that last 5 years. All of the above projects may well take more than 5 years. Therefore political brownie points may well be harvested by the opposition if you are voted out. Therefore in order to deny the opposition political parties such brownie points you simply do nothing which takes longer than your time in office to build. This is VERY bad and VERY short termist but it is a critical weakness of voting.

“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.


Because we build stuff on the cheap nothing lasts and needs to be constantly maintained. Costing more than a decent construction project would have cost on the first place. For instance thin road surfacing which relies on cars to press the surface in rather than using a mechanical roller. It's cheaper but it only lasts a year or two.

Now I may moan about working there sometimes, but I recommend you try and get in at the Co-Op. Decent wage (it's already been a ways above minimum for a while and we're getting a 10% rise in October). There's usually Co-ops all over the place and if you show you're motivated and put the work in, you can move to a totally different department. The Co-Op have their fingers in so many pies you could start out behind the tills in a shop and end up in real estate or HR or travel. I never planned on staying at the Co-Op, it was only ever meant to be a part-time thing through uni, but uni didn't work out and at least I'm working somewhere that actually does have prospects. I dunno what your plans are for the future but I think it's a good idea to make sure if things fall through you're at least somewhere with options. Also you can just pop in with your CV rather than faffing about jumping through hoops online. (Seriously some of those online applications are ridiculous).

BUT ANYWAY some things to put on your application (if it's online there's usually a box to put ""any other information"", if it's a CV write a cover letter): Write about how you would strive to give the service that you would expect if you were a customer yourself. Say that you understand the importance of good customer service, as you are the face of the company and your own personal actions will influence whether a customer comes back or not, etc etc. Make it sound like it's your life's dream to sell bread. xD

I don't think there's to be another major change although they do say ""fees normally increase annually in line with inflation and the University's strategic approach to fees"".

Basically they're now pitching themselves as a cheaper alternative to conventional universities so the fees are likely to stay in the current ballpark unless the government does something radical to normal full time fees which AFAIK is not currently on the agenda.

In other words, a house may have a hazard category of 4 (i.e. safe) if occupied by a fit adult, but category 1 if occupied by a frail 95 year old.

There is an extremely complicated formula which is applied based on the type of hazard, risk of different types of harm from the hazard, severity of each type of harm which all need to be summed together. For example, a fall from a ground floor window onto grass might have 99% chance of causing minor bruising, and 1% chance of causing a broken bone - these different scores need to be combined, to gain a score for the window.

Similarly, not all types of occupant are subject to certain types of hazard.

Further, the report does not note whether the source of the hazard is intrinsic to the property or whether it was introduced by the tenant.

I've checked online, and while many men were investigated in Rotherham, I can find evidence that only 6 were convicted. 5 Pakistani men in 2010, and one Afghan man a few years earlier.

Wrong. Read the Ceop study. Of Type 1 offenders:

Quote: 

&gt;Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, **75 per cent were categorised as Asian**, 17 per cent white, and the remaining 8 per cent black (5 per cent) or Arab (3 per cent).

Of those who were convicted, that figure was as high as 87%, as we've read previously.

According to the 2011 census in Britain, people who idenify as Asian or Asian British accounted for just 6.9% of the country's population.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom

But, we know via the Ceop study that of Type 1 offenders:

&gt;Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, **75 per cent were categorised as Asian**

Of those convicted in court:

&gt;The 27 court cases that we found led to the convictions of 92 men. Some 79 **(87 per cent) were reported as being of South Asian Muslim origin.**

Yes, they have rigorous standards for skilled migration, though people do get in on the ""family"" scheme, it's much harder than in the EU of course though. Possibly not as absurd as for UK citizens wanting to bring in non-EU spouses however.

I have been searching for this but can't find it, but there has been research that shows that skilled migrants represent an economic gain to Australia, whereas family-based migration tends to represent a loss.  EDIT [here is something](https://www.immi.gov.au/pub-res/Documents/research/family-migration-contribution-january-2014.pdf) but it's rather oozing with politically correct statements/falling over itself to be positive. But if you read between the lines, it's more or less admitting that family migration is not generally a net economic gain.

The issue with UK migration is what kind of migration the UK is actually getting. How skilled is it?  How much are those migrants generating in terms of how much they are costing?  Also, the ""ROI"" (return on immigrants!) may not always be immediate. Some of the migrants that don't represent an economic gain immediately may do so in five or ten years.

[This](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/skilled-migration-is-the-key-to-a-thriving-and-cohesive-economy/story-e6frgd0x-1226573810800) is interesting (link may not work unless you search on a phrase via Google):

&gt; But one thing is clear. Large numbers of unskilled migrants with full work rights certainly do not provide the proven economic benefits of the skilled variety; indeed, they may present social cohesion challenges, as Europe has discovered.

&gt; The contrast between much of Europe's experience and our own is to note the windfall gains that migration and particularly Australia's skills-focused migration has delivered under successive governments.

 Mandzukic scored 3 goals in 3 games in Euro 2012, he is one of the most efficient strikers in the world in last 3 seasons, has probably the best header in the world after Cristiano Ronaldo, benched Mario Gomez in Bayern and was important part of treble team of Bayern Munich's team with Jupp Heynckes on charge. Scored in Champions League final, was twice the second top scorer in Bundesliga (and was only 2nd that season behind Lewandowski because Heynckes saved him for Champions League) , so yeah, same as Rickie Lambert who played in 3rd English league just few years ago LOL.

No it's not just one guy, it's repeated constantly by those actually effected. I know it suits you to ignore those people. It's also not the case that [all studies show there is no impact on wages](http://global.oup.com/uk/pressreleases/32402029/).

&gt;Yes, of course there is going to a few instances and maybe a sector or two this will hold true, but overall it is proven to not lower wages of lower earners by any significant amount.

It's obviously going to be localised based on where the immigrants end up, they are often highly concentrated in certain areas. General studies about overall wages aren't going to give a true reflection of wage suppression. It's such basic logic that if you're competing with 1000 people then then next day 100,000 that is going to impact your wages. To deny that it would is incredible. 

&gt;What will help out lower earners however is a living wage. I assume you support that?!

If you increase wages all that will do is attract more immigrants. I support controlling immigration then increasing wages so people in this country reap the benefits. 

&gt;A few facts for you. Free Movement of people was/is a conservative ideal. The Conservative government(s) got us into the EU and agreed to the open borders.

Free movement is a corporatist ideal which benefits business at the expense of workers and it's now supported by the establishment on both the left and right but amongst the public the left have been more propagadised into supporting it. In the past you had people like Tony Benn on the left opposing the EU but that breed seems to have died out.

null,false,Shicchan,lfc99,,null,"I do think Coutinho is playing better this season, but so many people are severely underrating Raheem's performances, most likely because of this contract fiasco. 

He was very good for us till the second half of the season, and I think his dip can be attributed to one of a few things.

He's only 20 years old - when has a 20 year old attacking player ever been consistent? When hasn't a 20 year old played a couple absolute shocker games? 

He's played the second most minutes of any outfield player. Only Henderson's played more. We can't expect a 20 year old who is constantly being called upon to produce moments that test his physicality throughout the season to maintain peak form and ability. 

Position changes - he's not a striker or a wing back, we all know this by now. The position changes have definitely held back his form this season, and maybe lowered his confidence as a result of having many quiet games up at striker. 

Rodgers did manage him quite well this season, I thought. Gave him the break to Jamaica for a well-needed rest and generally placed his confidence in Raheem. I do wish he'd have played Borini or Markovic more in Raheem's place, but I do understand Rodgers' unwillingness to not rotate when we were in such a dire spot and Raheem seemed the most likely to dig us out of there (when Coutinho was playing quite inconsistently).

Honestly it's just come down to the fact that we don't really have an adequate replacement for Sterling, and so he's played all these minutes. He's our second best striker, best winger by far (Markovic and Borini not up to first team standard?) and he's even played in defence in a pinch.

Section 9. [**Legality of a referendum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#Legality_of_a_referendum) of article  [**Scottish independence referendum, 2014**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish%20independence%20referendum,%202014): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;There was debate as to whether the Scottish Parliament had the power to legislate for a referendum relating to the issue of Scottish independence, as the constitution is a reserved matter for the UK Parliament.  The Scottish government insisted in 2010 that they could legislate for a referendum, as it would be an ""advisory referendum on extending the powers of the Scottish Parliament"",  whose result would ""have no legal effect on the Union"".  :17 Lord Wallace, Advocate General for Scotland, said in January 2012 that holding a referendum concerning the constitution would be outside the legislative power of the Scottish Parliament   and that private individuals could challenge a Scottish Parliament referendum bill.

However, what seems to be happening is that people are starting to migrate away from the big subs and spend more and more time on the smaller, more niche, ones.

This means that there is a risk that large ones (like /r/unitedkingdom) are going to end up being populated by people who (more or less) all lean the same way politically (thereby turning “*debate*” into a euphemism for ""*never-ending circle jerk*”).

Of course not. But until a Yes vote in IndyRef 2.0, the people of Scotland have expressed a desire to remain part of the United Kingdom.

&gt; My point that a big part of the British national identity is that is depends on another country being in it, regardless of whether they want to be or not. A referendum, if it's held again, will wield another result, but I do not think it's healthy from a national identity standpoint to have your identity depend on an entity other than your own being united with you. Very few national identities depend on that.

We're into rather murky territory here since everyone has a different understanding of what it means to be British, but I don't really see a huge problem with identifying Britain as a union of distinct nations - that's essentially what it actually is. The people of Scotland have chosen to remain part of that union and I'm personally happy that that bond will continue.

There was a very recent study, I think, yesterday, which stated that this was not the case.

&gt;How could anyone argue against that? 

See my comment history, I take a good stab at it often.

&gt;If unrestricted immigration was so much better than selecive immigration every country would enact it. 

Well 26 EU nations and counting, some additional EFTA nations. A bunch of smaller countries with their neighbours in various regions. Then for the future, the entire continent of South America is considering it.

A year out of Europa league diminishes the value of our squad players, reduces their chance of breaking through, gives us less games, reduces club revenue and ultimately does nothing but killing our chance of winning the EL.

I could not agree more (assuming you forgot about Liverpool's 7th-&gt;2nd and put them there by accident?) and I get really frustrated by people who think we'll pull a Liverpool. PERHAPS we could've done that WITH Bale (as Liverpool did WITH Suarez), but Europa, in both the experience and the revenue we gain, is more valuable than a shot in the dark chance against United, City, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Liverpool. You'd be betting against terrible odds that two of the aforementioned five would slip up badly enough while we concurrently make good on enough of our chances to make the CL.

Even if we did, again our upside scenario is Liverpool. It's not like a fluke year (which is what it would be if we vaulted from a non-European spot to CL) would attract major stars to our club that would've gone to Chelsea/United.

&gt;Yes they are. Just not all of them. And this is a shame.

null,false,biffnix,null,null,null,"Well, Aidy Ward has his own fledgling sports agency, and would not make decisions that would alienate his clients or cost himself money at this point.  Sterling is his most high-profile client right now, and as a hot commodity, he'll do whatever it takes to extract the most money for his client (and, of course, his agency).  Other clubs will clearly be making offers, and rightly so.  The statements he's made are a win-win for himself and Sterling, in all honesty.  It get Aidy Ward in the news, it tells other clubs that Sterling is available for the highest bid, and it riles up Liverpool fans so that it's easier for Sterling to leave more quickly.  It actually makes sense to me.


The club has a few options, though.

* They force Sterling to honor his contract, and hope for one more good season out of him.  This keeps Sterling at Anfield, and Sterling has incentive to play well, so that other clubs will continue their interest, and offer big money as he enters the final year of his contract.  The risks to Sterling are injury, loss of form, and risk of losing playing time from an angry coaching staff.

* They force him to honor his contract, but loan him out.  Sterling is still incentivized to play well to keep his valuation high in the transfer market.  The club who gets him on loan subsidizes his cost to Liverpool,  so low risk for Liverpool.  Risk to Sterling is injury, or loss of form.

* The club sell him to the highest bidder.  Pros for club - decent money to buy a replacement.  No risk to Sterling in this option.  Risk to Liverpool - they buy someone who doesn't pan out, gets injured, costs too much (the Andy Carroll scenario).


Football is big business, so the owners will make the right decision for the club, I'm sure.  What Aidy Ward says is irrelevant, as long as fans keep in mind that the agent will only say or do things that benefit their client.

I think this is exactly what I was talking about.  The Greens aren't about 'gathering support'.  They're about making policies that they think are best, and then it goes to vote to see if people agree with them - let democracy do what it does.  If anything, this is the *most* democratic thing to do.  It wins here in Brighton because people are generally a bit more open to 'new and zany' ideas like social welfare protection and ecologically healthy policies - but it doesn't really work anywhere else because as you say - people seem to believe that 'not getting embarrassed' on shitrag news channels is more important.

&gt;Party leaders need to be leaders, not people 'doing their best'

Well this simply isn't true, it's just what more people seem to believe at this moment in time - I imagine they believe it because they get told it every day in soundbites and sharply defined bright colours that are impossible to ignore.  Leaders should always simply be 'people doing their best', and to pretend they are anything above that is disingenuous.

&gt;just relying on the fact they're 'doing the right thing'.

If this isn't enough for the people then the people will get something else - but the option is there courtesy of the Green party.  Again, this is exactly my point.  If people want to look good over 'doing the right thing' then that's exactly what they'll get, and it's exactly what we have.  That's democracy.

&gt;If the party wants to get itself into the position to be able to actually influence the political landscape of this nation it has to play the game properly.

I can't disagree with the pragmatic notion here - but I just see it differently.  The game is rigged and toxic.  The second you start playing by the rules necessary to win is the very same second you become as empty as the rest of them.  The game has had it, but it will limp on as long as there is the necessary electoral weight to keep it alive.

&gt; It's such a shitty situation, but as long as the framework for democracy and our society as a whole benefits the right, you have to behave like one.

If that were true, then we are necessarily at the peak of human potential, and we will live what we have until the end of the human story - because there is nor ever will be an option, will or potential for something different.  If you behave like 'it' because you need to behave like 'it' to be involved with 'it' - then it will never change.

2. Pep is still speculation and players probably believe in the wishes of the owners more rather than the coach. As the coach is still a job. Players will still want to win trophies even if its a different manager. A matter of coach change just changes the attitude and I'm fairly sure  that with both coaches our boys will be still motivated.
3. Even if Pep is a rumour, Pelle might get scared of losing his job unless he wants to manage another team. If he tries out new stuff which gives extremely good results, City will probably keep him and sign a new contract. If not, if he completely fails in the next season and we actually have to fight for 4th place etc., he'll probably be less appealing to other teams.
4. Don't think Pelle has that kind of attitude, if so, Pep will need to adjust and overhaul our team again.
5. Managers are Managers, they still want to win trophies and titles and string them under their belt. Winning a title/trophy means more money for the club but that's not as much of an influence for clubs like Bayern.

The concern is you don't know what you don't know, and if they are allowed to treat people without direct supervision (and if they are supervised for each patient, they serve no use), then they will miss things, putting the patient at risk.

I have no problem with PAs in clinics, because a doctor has already diagnosed you before you reach that hospital.  

We spend a lot of time and money training medics in Primary Care, it's hard and stressful and in my view that initial diagnosis should be left to doctors.  

I think the gap they could fill would be as active listeners to those with mental health issues including loneliness. I think removing the ""repeat customers"" from the GP's back would free up significant time, especially those needing home visits.

Here is a recent example of his work: 

&gt; On January 19th, 2015, Boras negotiated a 7-year, $210 million contract with the Washington Nationals for free agent Max Scherzer,[169] who turned down at least $144 million from the Detroit Tigers before the 2014 season.

Some of his more famous deals include opting out of a 10 year $252 million dollar contract mid-way for Alex Rodriguez, and instead making it 10 years 275m with a bunch of addon bonuses worth at least 30m.

The dude is good at what he does. 4 Contracts in baseball have peaked over 300m, he has 3 of them. 

Boras took 2 players from the Red Sox and signed them to their rivals, the Yankees because the Sox refused to sign them to absurd deals. (Johnny Damon and Jacoby Ellsbury). Thats equivalent to taking 2 LFC players and signing them up to ManU.

This shit head Aidy is no comparison what so ever.

EDIT: I think many of you are missing the point I'm making, that the Red Sox have a price in mind for a player, they don't go above and beyond it like other teams would to sign them. They will let a free agent walk if they feel they are getting ripped off.

I don't deal in belief, I trust is data and study. The data, and the studies, state we have not had an economic loss due to this unrestricted emigration here.

&gt;We're not only open to countries of similar economic standing

We're not? Better tell Ireland, France, Germany, etc.

&gt;It benefits them far more than it does us. They can come here temporarily save money then take it back to their own country where they'll have an improved standard of living

The work needs doing, and they get taxed on it and spend some of it while they are here. I fail to see the problem.

&gt;The poorest here have to compete with incredibly low wage workers and will either struggle to find work or won't be able to live comfortably off the work they do get.

 [**Webster ruling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%20ruling): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Webster ruling__ is a [test case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law\)) in association football [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_law) involving [Andy Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Webster), a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) formerly with [Heart of Midlothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [transfer regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(football\)) of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), football's [governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body), which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) of 1995 in its potential significance.

You're an apologist.

It's people like you and your excuses who anger so many people, people like you strengthen the far right and racists who use things like this for political leverage. Because if a well adjusted and seemingly intelligent man sharing the same ethnicity of the predators, thinks there's not a problem, contrary to all evidence and facts, then that's that? Nothing to see here, move along?

If people like you won't address it, then who the fuck will?

Frustrating as fuck this. I've had to labour over just getting you to confront reality, and you've repeatedly dismissed it outright.

You said you're against things like this. Then be part of the move to change, and reflect upon the uncomfortable questions re race, religion and culture - what was culpable and what wasn't.

What can be done to make sure girls inside and outside the Asian community are not harmed by similar predators in future.

I don't have all the answers, but I want to be part of positive change. And I'd hope you do to.

No, I live in the real world using facts and reasoning to make a decision, not fear and small-mindedness.  Of course I consider negatives, for instance, if EU immigration was a drain on our economy I would not be for it.  My primary concern is for UK actually.

You are missing the point. We have more economic benefit if we could be selective. If you have bag of money filled with different denominations and randomly pick them out at the end of the day you will have benefited. If you look into the bag and only select the highest denominations you will end up with more. I can't make it more simplistic for you. 

&gt;We're not? Better tell Ireland, France, Germany, etc.

The point was we're not only open to countries of similar economic standing. You said other countries don't have open borders because they're not surrounded by countries of similar economic standing. I replied that with the EU we're not just taking in people on a similar level so we shouldn't have an open door either.

&gt;The work needs doing, and they get taxed on it and spend some of it while they are here. I fail to see the problem.

It would benefit the country more if people from this country who would keep all the money here did that work. They'd also get a higher wage and better standard of living because they weren't competing with so many people.

now do i think there is a bit of unfair criticism towards players in this? of course, but that's all the more reason to keep things on the down low and go about your business quietly. i think you have a lot of validity rushy, but i think raheem camp has done this poorly. an unsanctioned interview on bbc was the first step in a poorly managed attempt to get more money/leave. that is what pisses people off. it's the dragging of the club through the mud, which as much i love suarez, he did. the difference is that suarez shut up and put up the next season and got rewarded. raheem should have recognized that, maybe if he put in one more year, a blinder of a year at that, he could have gotten the big move, helped lfc get paid off and gotten another full season with 40+ matches.

I'm all for evidence-based policy but there are lots of decisions in politics where you can't just state your assumptions and plug some values into an algorithm. I personally think this is a horribly vindictive policy where the employer gets cheap labour, the employee gets horribly exploited with nothing to show for it and the government probably gets a totally negligible amount of money.

He felt insulted/let down and now wants to find a club that actually wants him and will compensate him fairly for his services. Nothing wrong with that.

I *really* don't think he wants that.

My understanding is that, while the ECHR can certainly make a huge fuss, it doesn't affect parliamentary soveriegnty, so it can't actually stop us from doing things.

The Red Sox are one of the most storied teams in baseball. They had not won the World Series since 1918 though, much like how LFC have failed to win the league for a while. FSG bought the team in 2002 and they won the World Series in 2004 and then again in 2007. During this time the players and coaches for the Red Sox became somewhat of living legends for Red Sox fans since most had never seen the team win the World Series and lived through a title drought of 86 years. The manager, Terry Francona, was heralded and still is by most to be the best Red Sox manager to ever live.

In 2011 the team is doing great and in 1st place in their division of the league. That is until September, the last month of the season rolls around. The team plays one of the worst months of baseball and misses out on playoffs on the last day of the season (It was one of the craziest days in baseball history. Think man city scoring 2 in extra time to be snatch league from united crazy). 

The club is in disarray. This is the perfect storm for scandals to break out and that they did. Within the next month news broke that players were drinking beer, eating fried chicken, and playing video games in the locker room during games. Basically, Francona lost control of his team. FSG fired his ass (see didn't renew his contract for the next year). The manager that won the league in his first year as manager after others had failed for 86 years, then won it again three years later, fired after one terrible month. 

TL;DR FSG fired manager that won league for first time in 86 years and twice in three years after one month where he lost control of his team.

If I sell personalized birthday cakes, should I be able to refuse to make a ""Happy Birthday Mohammed"" cake on the basis that most people called Mohammed are Muslims? If I sell custom wedding cakes, should I be able to refuse to make ones with same-sex toppers, or interracial toppers? Sometimes the details of an order are closely related to the customer's protected characteristic(s), as in this case.


*I* don't want to draw a line, or for a court to. That should be up to the business owner. None of the examples you've given are about discriminating against a customer, but orders. An order not being fulfilled isn't the same as being rejected from being served anything because of superficial characteristics.

&gt;Nobody is suggesting that there is. They do have a duty to follow equality law, though. They could probably even get around this ruling by introducing a neutral policy such as ""no messages about marriage"" or ""no political messages"".


I agree it would have been more sensible to phrase it that way from the start and they could have avoided hassle. It's obvious why. But whatever their reasoning behind not wanting any slogan in particular shouldn't matter. They shouldn't have to be politically neutral for the same reason they shouldn't have to pretend to be enthusiastic about any particular political stance.



&gt;How is that in any way analogous?


Because it is. Read it again, is all I can say.


&gt;And it pisses me off that so many people who are supposedly interested in civil liberties focus their ire on extremely minor restrictions being placed on privileged bigots. Vast numbers of LGBT people are still partially or fully in the closet due to the attitudes of their families, friends, and colleagues. Kids are still being indoctrinated with the idea that same-sex relationships are unacceptable, or even being sent to conversion therapists, often resulting in depression, self-harm, or worse. Where is their freedom of expression? Why on earth is it so important to you that people should be able to promote hateful and oppressive ideologies by whatever absurd means they want to?


A bit over dramatic and on a tangent, but I'll address this properly anyway. You're mixing up the two tolerances, as I call them. There is a good reason why the law should tolerate views the majority of people find disgusting. Firstly so you know what views people hold. You don't actually stop people thinking what they think by censoring or punishing them for it. And it goes against the principle of freedom of speech, which is one of the most important civil liberties, and part of the solid bedrock under our democracy. You either have freedom of thought/conscience and freedom of speech/expression, or you don't. There isn't a grey area. When the state dictates what legally acceptable opinions are, you're deep down the rabbit hole of totalitarianism.
The second tolerance is what individuals and community tolerate. What ideas a community allows to flourish by not challenging them with debate, or by encouraging them. If you want to change people's attitudes, don't fine them or send them to prison, argue with them. Words change minds much better. If you want people you know to be more accepting of sexual minorities so they can 'come out' and feel comfortable, express that. By way of everyday conversation in your workplace or in a campaign group to raise awareness. These are sensible approaches to changing any other social attitudes.
Lastly, I don't think you live in the United Kingdom. Perhaps if you do, you're in a Afro-Caribbean or Muslim enclave. There's plenty of the second tolerance of sexual minorities in the UK among the natives. It's much rarer than it was even 20 years ago that someone would be ridiculed, intimidated or attacked for being a sexual minority.

No, quite the opposite. What I'm saying is if you're going to present an argument of the form ""Illegal immigration is costing the taxpayer X amount of money"" but the figures appear specious that's going to undercut your argument somewhat. If the argument's just ""illegal immigration isn't something we want to encourage"" then that's a different type of conversation, although money's going to form a part of it because there's always a limited amount of money and resources to spend.

&gt; I'm all for evidence-based policy but there are lots of decisions in politics where you can't just state your assumptions and plug some values into an algorithm.  
  
Sure, I agree. And even if you have evidence in most areas of politics that doesn't in and of itself make the decision for you except in exceptional cases. There's always a debate to be had.

That is precisely what I am saying is manifestly not the case.

&gt;I can't make it more simplistic for you. 

Please, I understand the point you are making. But it is too micro. With all the factors in play for this discussion, I am afraid your simplification is not directly applicable.

&gt;The point was we're not only open to countries of similar economic standing

The use of ""only"" is not something you used prior, hence my direction.

&gt;It would benefit the country more if people from this country who would keep all the money here did that work. 

Yet, that was not the case. If it were, then that is what would occur and there would be no need for foreign nationals.

&gt;They'd also get a higher wage and better standard of living because they weren't competing with so many people. 

However there would also be fewer jobs available, which has the opposite effect on wages.

&gt;The immigrants may have skills but most them are doing minimum wage low skilled jobs. 

Let's look at this a little;

&gt;According to the figures, there were 666,000 low-skilled foreign-born people working in the British economy during the first quarter of 2011 

Right, but how many higher skilled workers were there? The dataset as used by the BBC doesn't state, so lets look at Gov.uk (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-and-occupational-skill-levels-among-uk-and-foreign-nationals);

&gt;Oct–Dec 2011	1,341 (thousand unskilled)	1,214 (thousand skilled)

So yes, you are right that there are more unskilled. But the difference of ~120k is quite negligible. And remember, a lot of those coming in from the A8 have skills far beyond those required for the jobs they are doing, however they are happy to work in lower skilled jobs regardless.

I'd be very happy to bring in any of the attacking players mentioned particularly young Gerri. However:  
If I was a young Spanish star, I'd much rather be at Sevilla, they are a better team than us right now.  
Hernandez would be a great back up/partner for Rom but he is a proven goal scorer internationally, at Man Utd and Real Madrid, I doubt we can afford him.  
Nani is very talented, but sometimes he's just plain shite. If we offload some wingers then he might be a good loan addition.  
Nolito for £13M would be good, we could have used someone like him this season for sure, he would really liven up our attack.  
I know nothing of Beauvue, if anyone could enlighten me, that would be nice.  
  
Defensively we could probably do with some cover, we have to bare in mind that whoever comes in will have to spend most of his time on the bench.  
I rate Johnny Evans, at 27 though I think if he leaves Utd he will want to be a first choice CB, im also not sure if £10 million is a bit much for an injury prone CB.  
Van Dijk would be a great future partner for John Stones, there's definitely potential there, not sure if he'd wanna wait till Jags retires till he gets to play week in week out though.

Where in your previous comments was this question? 

I don't exactly know what it will look like, something egalitarian, regards humans as just one life form among many, values freedom and tries to balance it against social responsibility. I support abolition of private property and degrowth. Nothing you haven't read about before. 

&gt;I would perhaps suggest you follow the principle of 'Chesterton's Fence' - before you seek to tear something down, you should first understand what it does and why it was put there.

You want me to accept the system on your terms before I criticise, so it appears. Silly Billy. 

&gt;But if you don't want to do that, perhaps you could tell me in more detail how your proposed revolutionary system would respond to shifts in demand?

Why is this so interesting? It seems to me the least problematic thing. Society can easily devise systems for producing and distributing stuff. Once humans decide not to support the existing world of bollocks, we should be able to devise a democratic means to organise the shit that needs doing. 

Revolution is, of course, contingent on an evolution in the human mindset so I don't need to devise a new system until a substantial majority of the other monkeys think - fuck this, I'm outta here. When you all stop participating, we can sit down and have a nice chat about who's going to grow the rice and who's going to take the rubbish out.

Because that can cause a financial crisis and recession. US house prices falling in 2007 was what caused the financial crisis. We're more protected from it now due to regulation, but it would still hit the economy hard. So much of the UK economy is tied into in property. As assets, they form the vast majority of securities for loans. If the security loses its value, suddenly you're looking at a loss.

In Birmingham, to be an uber driver, you have to have a Birmingham City Council cab licence.  Hence you only ever see taxis as Uber cars in birmingham.  I think London definitely provides a better Uber experience than Birmingham.  

Also, I think drivers are getting a little disgruntled with Uber too...when Uber first started, all uber drivers were paid £10/hr as a minimum, regardless if they had any customers.  Uber is removing that perk and the last driver I spoke to told me many drivers are moving back to other cab companies instead.

3. Keep him, but loan him out.  Costs the club nothing, since the club he's loaned to will pick up the cost.  Sterling still must play at a high level, in order to keep his value as contract expires.  Liverpool still makes profit when selling him.


Liverpool has all the cards in this hand.  Ward is only making noise because it's the only way to get Sterling sold early.

Far too short sighted and wanting immediate gratification. Guess what? Football usually doesn't work like that. One season does not make a player. Rose was shit last season:

Liverpool fucked up pretty badly, trying to paint Sterling as this money grubbing mercenary. They have essentially alienated the player and the fans perception of the player. Though I would take the fan's opinions with a grain of salt because they are a bunch of salty fucks. Look at how quick United fans are to dismiss DDG as soon as rumours start flying around a potential move.

Sterling realizes and so does everyone in the world except Scousers, that Liverpool is just a feeder club at the moment. They cannot sustain a legitimate title challenge or successful Champions League campaign. He knows the club cannot hold onto key players so he's jumping ship.

He is only 20 years old and already proven in the PL but he is way too young(inconsistent) and inexperienced to be the main man. His breakout season was alongside the powerhouse of Sturdige and Suarez. Alongside a team with world class players in all positions he would thrive. Which is why all the comments of his riding the bench at Bayern, Chelsea, etc are easily dismissed. 

I think he would be great fit for us personally. He's homegrown and the young direct winger that would wreck teams in tandem with Hazard. But, the likelihood of getting is pretty slim, maybe on par with our chances of poaching Rooney.

null,false,Melberger,null,null,null,"That's good to hear mate, and maybe we should bring this exchange to a close on that note.

However, I will make one important distinction between your example.

In Delhi the sexual violence is among people from an ethnic majority targeting their same ethnic group.

Sexual violence comes in many different forms of course, as you've highlighted with Jimmy Saville, but in these specific cases (which have been recorded across the UK), the predators are from a minority ethnic group. And their victims were from the majority ethnic group.

People knew about it. The police actively ignored it, politicians didn't want to confront it.

This was due to the sensitivities about race.

Read the report I've linked previously, and you can read their conclusions for yourself.

That's a dimension that *has* to be recognised as culpable in the abuse. Otherwise it could be repeated once more.

Attitudes like you've expressed previously are precisely why there is a reluctance to touch on the topic. People get defensive. Anyone who runs a critical eye over the topic risks being called a racist.

And in the meantime, thousands of girls are raped and abused because people are too cowardly to confront it.

That's why there's so much anger around this topic, that's why the far-right have capitalised so greatly on this. Because people see how the mainstream politicians ignored this issue due to cautiousness over race and political sensibilities.

If we want to combat the racist sexual predators, and the racists in the far-right, then ordinary people like you and me have to speak up.

Although its *nice* to see police on the beat in your neighbourhood, the evidence for their actual effectiveness is fairly iffy. Hence why the number of police on the beat has gone down and so has crime. They are able to be utilised in far more effective ways (eg by car).  I can't imagine that a police officer walking down a residential street is going to often come across a crime. In fact, a policeman on the beat is going to detect first hand a burglary no more than once in every 8 years (Slapper, 1999). This video is designed to show that its pretty much all they do.

Really, nobody is telling the police they can't have lots of bobbies on the beat, they are telling the police they can't have as much money. And the police are using the 'less on the beat' line as its clearly the most emotive. Well, I prefer (and I suspect Reddit users prefer) a science based approach to crime prevention, and that is why money is now allocated in a different way.

It's interesting because - in the context of our conversation - you asked why I was so 'interested' in this problem. I said I was interested because it wa a hard problem which you appeared not to have considered. It doesn't have a simple solution, and so I tend to distrust people who say 'We'll figure it out after the revolution'. There are a few other examples of this kind of problem, but this is the one which I think is the 'impossible' problem of heterodox economics - if you solved this I would believe anything was possible.

It's hard because it relies on aggregating knowledge from across the planet. For example the amount of coffee produced depends on what farmers know about the yield that year, what supermarkets know about consumer preferences for different kinds of beans, and what tea producers know about whether they will have a bumper year (reducing the demand for coffee as a substitute is available). It also depends on probabilistic judgements about - for example - whether anyone is going to invent a substitute for coffee next year. That's a simple example where nothing but a preference is on the line - a more complex example would be something like the demand for medical drugs or prosthetic limbs; highly specialised equipment where getting the supply wrong means people could die (either because there aren't enough drugs to go round, or because they produce too many drugs and so there aren't enough factories producing prosthetic limbs). Not only that, but it has to be more-or-less immune to people making mistakes about their preferences / beliefs, and to automatically adjust to new inventions / knowledge as they occur.

Let me give you an example; suppose I have a factory which can produce *either* one hundred pencils per day, or ten fountain pens per day (or some proportional mix, like forty pencils and six fountain pens). How many of each should they produce? What would you need to know before you decided the daily output? With prices I can solve it *really* easily. I don't understand how your system would solve it. You can't just go and talk to the factory owner, because there are millions of factories around the world and it takes too long. You can't rely on the factory owner making the right decision, because it is probably easier for them to just bash out a few pencils and call it a day - they might not even produce all 100, because you're not an expert in pencil factories and can't prove they're slacking. So how do you do it? Remember pencils and pens are a silly example, but the solution to pencils and pens has to work for *every* industry in the entire country.",null,0,null,1432225352,null,0,false,0,crggpt2,null,t3_36i3nu,null,t1_crggpt2,null,t1_crgfmsq,null,null,null,1433190140,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"People often get the definition of serious crimes like ""murder"" wrong. For example, here is a list of scenarios - see if you can pick at what point the crime stops being murder and becomes something less serious. 

**1**

A pulls out a gun, aims for B's chest, shoots and kills him.

**2**

A pulls out a gun, aims at B's chest and shoots him. He misses, and hits the shoulder instead. B would probably survive this, but he is standing at the top of some stairs and falls backwards and dies from a head injury.

**3**

As number 2 above, except A aimed for the shoulder not the chest. 

**4** 

A aims to shoot B in the shoulder and does so. B would survive normally, but unknown to A he is a haemophiliac and so dies. 

**5**

A aims and shoots B in the shoulder. A regrets this and notices B bleeding a lot, and tries to help and call an ambulance. The ambulance arrives and despite B having a medical alert bracelet, gives B a drug he is allegric to and B dies. 

**6**

A aims and shoots B in the shoulder. B is seriously injured, but a blood transfusion would probably help save his life. But B is a JW and refuses and dies. 

Ok...

So where did you think the crime stopped being murder? The answer, is surprisingly, that it didn't. A is guilty of murder in each scenario. Now, A is not a pleasant chap in each case, but is he really in the later cases a blood thirsty murderer like we have been trained to expect by TV, Daily Mail etc? Or he is someone that did something very wrong that should be punished, but he could be rehabilitated? I use shooting as it is easy to visualise, but it could be a fight after a night out or anything - the surprising thing to many is that there is no requirement of an intention to kill for murder in English law, instead the intent required is to cause serious harm. Still nasty, but a *lot* less so. 

My point is, people speak of hanging ""murderers"" etc all the time. Howver, they don't really know what a murderer is. They are a lot less 'evil' than would be expected. Should we be so ready to hand done brutal punishments to these people?

Finally, take solace in this - despite this very wide definition of murder, only around 600 people are convicted of it each year. That in my mind is refreshingly small in a population of 65 million.

No disrespect. 

I don't imagine the entire system of the global economy is going to change overnight. The revolution starts with people thinking they no longer want to participate in this unfair and ecocidal economic system. 

Long before that revolution takes place, the Earth is going to react against our species and whoever is left is going to have to restructure the way they do business. The chances are that some new types of gangsters will take charge. But if the revolution occurs, perhaps humans will take a more cooperative approach. 

The revolution can not be televised. It might not even be identifiable until it's all done. The revolution is you not trying to make arguments for this system which is already in terminal decline (if you know all the literature already, don't ask me why I think this is the case, otherwise John Michael Greer is as good a place as any to start). 

Let's run things like Cuba does. Let's use Parecon. Let's make all businesses democratically run co-ops owned by the workers. Let's prevent anyone earning any more than anyone else.

Again, this was for the benefit of the state, and situations where countries have full employment (or almost full employment) were common in capitalist societies before the 1970s, so it's hardly a trait only seen in socialist societies. 

&gt; everyone belongs to the same political party?

Again, there's a difference. In proper socialism (say, for example, Cuba), democracy still exists. All politicians might be part of the same party, but there is a public role in electing them. This was not the case under National Socialism. 

&gt; And the Nazis were socialists, in the sense of wanting to provide for their people

Isn't that a *massively* broad definition of socialism? By that definition, pretty much every form of government ever could be counted as socialist.

What you're doing its looking at the individual instruments of a political sphere, and hypothesising a political ideology from that. Yes, there may have been some overlap between the institutions within a national socialist society and a socialist society, the same way that there was some overlap between the institutions within a national socialist society and a capitalist society. What is most important, however, isn't the institutions a government uses, it's what they plan to use those institutions for. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the end goal of most, if not all, socialist governments wasn't the genocide of millions of people who they viewed as genetically inferior to the people within their nation. It wasn't the advancement of one 'race' over another. It was communism. This is why national socialism and socialism are so different, and at completely opposite ends of the political spectrum. Yes, they may have shared certain political institutions, but that's irrelevant in the scheme of things, because their end goals and overall ideology were in complete opposition to one another.",null,0,null,1432226561,null,0,false,0,crghhi6,null,t3_36qy68,null,t1_crghhi6,null,t1_crggi0s,null,null,null,1433190503,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Going in with a lowballed figure is so it's easier to get something approved.

If they said it would be over £10 billion from the start parliament would likely have said no.

Also they calculate the number as if nothing can go wrong, or costs change.  Say a project takes 10 years to complete - the wages, materials costs, etc towards the end of the project will still be calculated at the same level as at at the start for the purposes of the initial cost estimation

That seems reckless - especially because it is our kids that will have to pick up the mess. In particular, if our new revolutionary system goes wrong, they will almost certainly reinvent market capitalism because it has already solved a number of the problems which I outline. So *even if* capitalism is something to be avoided with all our might, we must still consider it or else we'll just be reinventing it through our children.

Let me give an example; you want to make all businesses democratically run co-ops, and you want nobody to earn more than anybody else. What if a business *wants* to pay some employees more than others, and has a majority vote agreeing to that distribution (maybe it is eg a pencil factory and all workers agree the worker who produces the most pencils should get a bonus). Which gives? The democracy or the equality? Surely you should at least sort out issues like this before you try to implement it as a system?

null,false,TheForeignMan,null,null,null,"&gt; Any society with richer and poorer people will have people in 'relative poverty', even if the poorest is living the lifestyle of a millionaire (of course I'm not saying this is the case in the UK). 

Not true - you're in relative poverty if your income is less than 40% of the median. This means that you can have rich and poor people without anyone in poverty. For example, if you had an economy of 10 people, earning: £50, £50, £60, £100, £100, £100, £100, £150, £160, the median income would be £100. You'd have to earn £40 or less to be in poverty, but the lowest earner is earning £50. They are poor, but they're not in relative poverty.  

I honestly doubt there is anyone who is living in absolute poverty (earning less than $1.50 a day) in the UK. Relative poverty is a useful thing to measure though as you're excluded from society if you can't afford a TV or a phone (for example), which leads to who bunch of problems both for the society as well as the individual.

null,false,IlliniToffee,newcr-1,,null,"Not rumors but I'm bored at work so here's what one uninformed idiot (me) thinks should be the priorities, assuming no major losses from this year's squad.

CAM: Barkley may well still grow into this position, and Naismith is useful there, but a lot of the inability in breaking down defenses came from being unable to play cleverly through the middle (some of this got better as McCarthy slotted further forward).  If I had to make a splashy signing anyway, it would be here, especially if Barkley's future may be further back alongside McCarthy.

Wings: Especially if Mirallas leaves but even if he doesn't.  Someone on the right who can link up with Coleman is especially crucial, as Lennon showed.  I'm not personally enamored with Deulofeu but he'd fill that role.

CB: If nothing else, just as injury cover for Jags and Stones. Galloway is potentially a third and may be on the verge of a permanent presence with the first team.  Personally I'd like to see Besic played there, but I'm in the minority on that one and Martinez sees his future in midfield.

Striker: It's a bit of a funny position because Rom is practically first name on the team sheet, and with no European football he figures to play most every game, and yet it feels like he badly needs cover.  Best case scenario is that someone like Long turns out to be useful enough when necessary, but a new body is probably needed.  I'd love Charlie Austin but it's awfully tough to justify spending that kind of money on a second striker.

GK: I don't see it as a huge priority, but others will disagree.  I'd rather spend the money on better quality up front than bringing in someone like Begovic.

RB: Cover for Coleman, but Browning is probably good enough there, and I suppose Stones could slide over in a pinch if necessary.

LB: Already a bit glutted, although obviously less so if (1) Garbutt leaves, as he appears he will, and (2) Baines ever makes his fabled move to midfield.  The Galloway cameo is intriguing but that's probably not his future spot.

DM: Can't imagine bringing anyone else in unless there are major departures.",null,0,null,1432229754,null,0,false,0,crgjjjc,null,t3_36r5ym,null,t1_crgjjjc,null,t3_36r5ym,null,null,null,1433191542,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

null,false,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"Used to deal with Landlords like this all the time, they always used to be a massive hassle as they wanted to keep 100% of the rent each month and invest nothing into the property whilst expecting to make loads of money off it in 10 years. They wouldn't carry out basic repairs, had no idea what wear and tear was and used to think tenants should thank them for the privilege. I've gotten into arguments many times when landlords tried to show me around their property without the tenant know we were coming and I would refuse to go in. Most of them didn't get that when you rent it out you're not allowed to barge in and complain they've left a plate out.

I was once sat down with an older woman, her tenants weren't able to pay the rent that month due to their benefits being a mess as one had recently gained employment again. She stood screaming at me for about 20 minutes (covering me in old lady spit) when I tried mentioning that if you having nothing in reserve and are relying on your tenants rent month to month to make your own payments, financially that isn't a good place to be.

The roof fell through (I'd left by then thank god) costing her a good £5k to fix, she didn't have landlord insurance either. As far as I can remember she had to sell the house she was living in, move into the property she'd kept in terrible condition for years and the tenants got social housing.

Top tip if you're looking for a landlord, ask how many properties they own. If they have a lot they generally should know what they are doing. Beware people who clearly have property as an investment (not that actual landlords don't make bank on their properties) if they're shit with their finances you will lose out.

The idea there is such a thing culturally as a ""black community"" is for example nonsense. There is often friction between west Indian blacks and African blacks, recent immigrants and second generation etc. However this doesn't stop opportunists jumping on the narrative of mainly US black history to push a political platform. Ultimately all this ends up doing is reinforcing difference and making it harder for actual communities of people and individuals to break out of this monolithic ""black"" identity with all its attendant baggage. ""The black community"" is a political and social construct created 50 years ago, and its outliving its purpose.

The same thing is happening to Muslim communities. For almost a century we've not had any problem with north African Muslims, Turks, Balkan Muslim immigration. A deep problem with extremism in a prodigal, mainly rural sliver of the Pakistani community that has emigrated here condemns all Muslims to the prison of simplistic multiculturalist doctrine.

null,false,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware",null,"&gt;But you seem to think we should overthrow this system without trying to understand what we would put in place instead, and what the effects of different changes are likely to be.

The revolution is first in your mind. If I didn't articulate that well, I apologise. You have to emancipate yourself from mental slavery, as an old stoner once said. You can't devise new systems thinking within a dead culture, or dying if that's easier to digest. The revolution or even evolution would be cool, has to occur somewhere that can effect actual change. As fun as it would be to march the current ruling class to the guillotine, history doesn't suggest to me that would likely lead to anything useful. 

That's where it's at. Now if you go to devise an alternative system and actually try to discuss implementing it with others, you will soon find yourself under arrest. 

&gt; In particular, if our new revolutionary system goes wrong, they will almost certainly reinvent market capitalism because it has already solved a number of the problems which I outline.

I don't see it solved anything that couldn't have been solved via other means. The flow of the past to today seems to have yielded capitalism. That's all. It has no inevitability about it. There have been a few empires before that were not capitalist. They did some awesome stuff. All ruled by cunts of course. 

&gt;So even if capitalism is something to be avoided with all our might, we must still consider it or else we'll just be reinventing it through our children.

Your children are fucked, I'm sorry to say. That's why this subject is somewhat moot and considering anything about capitalism aside from why we should get rid of it is going to be a luxury afforded only to those lucky enough to have bought land in sunny Siberia in forty or so years. If you had a strong feeling for what's going on you'd be yelling that we have to stop this now. I feel very sorry about children. They are fucked. I'm very glad I don't have any, also for not having the hassle of it but mainly because we headed for a hot planet, no food and the Israelis are itching to let off some nukes, as is the US. 

&gt;Let me give an example; you want to make all businesses democratically run co-ops, and you want nobody to earn more than anybody else. What if a business wants to pay some employees more than others, and has a majority vote agreeing to that distribution

If you think that a democratically run co-op is likely to vote for some employees to be paid vastly more than the others, I would question your assumptions about humanity. But let's say some organizations got taken over by powerful propagandists/demagogues or NLP experts, if that's what they want, democracy means they can do that. 
(The whole pencil analogy is boring. It's like you are talking out of a text book. Nothing from a text book can ever be useful. Let it go, the people who write text books are trying to limit your knowledge.)

&gt;By the way - I just wanted to add that I am really enjoying this conversation; I suspect we're not going to end up agreeing, but I'm very pleased you're still willing to engage without trolling, and I hope you appreciate the same attitude from me. Makes a refreshing change from some pol/econ discussios I've had on reddit.

Sure. I'm glad to have some sort of exchange, I guess. I'm not sure I find discussions about these subjects particularly entertaining since I've arrived at my understanding before having it validated by some elements of human intelligentsia and some philosophers and spiritual thinkers, for want of a better term. Humanity's stupidity is too transparent.

Meanwhile, according to the [UN](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196402/icode/) 30% of the world's agricultural area is used to produce food which is wasted annually (an estimated 1.6 billion tonnes). That figure also accounts for 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2.  Red meat [costs](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars) (on average) more resources/land and causes more environmental damage than raising equivalent amounts of crops. We're producing a global [surplus of food](http://www.oxfam.ca/there-enough-food-feed-world) but some people are over consuming whilst others starve. We're all buying crap we don't need, while our governments aren't building green infrastructure because of economics, and people would rather fly and eat their big macs than address structural problems. I think it's easy to blame population growth in developing countries etc. for the strain on resources and the environment, but there's a lot that we should be looking at first before we start advocating reductions/culls. Just one billion people living the average Western lifestyle is still probably too much long term.

what is also funny is that no one really cares/appreciates when less talented players show respect/class/loyalty. look at borini, who has rejected moves to other clubs and in the process sacrificed higher wages and a more prominent role. hes spoken very highly of the club and shown a lot of heart. no one gives a fuck; hes just part of the shit strike force, and in talking about summer plans, most are expecting or hoping that he is moved on and replaced, without any mention of his attitude towards the club and his desire to be a part of the club in any capacity.  

that fact is that as nice as it is to see those qualities, they dont really confer any tangible benefit to the player. i think that the vitriol stems from two places: 

1) anger at perceived arrogance on sterling's part, thinking he is a player worthy of more than what liverpool can offer in terms of trophies and success. i wouldnt argue with that perception, but one cant deny that liverpool unperformed this season, and hes been asked to shoulder most of the load. good teams do not rely on a 19 boy to carry them on the strength of their performances. 

2) he's hurting liverpools effort to build upon a solid core of young players. the media is predominantly ex-liverpool players or have some affiliation with the club, so of course they will all rip on him for attempts to weaken the club.

i am not insulated sterling from all criticism; there has been an element of stupidity throughout his actions in this whole saga, but i cant help but feel that if he was managed better and the squad had more players of a high caliber, he'd never have grown to feel that he was the player the team needed to rely upon, and that his wage should reflect this",null,0,null,1432232634,null,0,false,0,crglehn,null,t3_36rtty,null,t1_crglehn,null,t3_36rtty,null,null,null,1433192418,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

There is the excuse that teams that do it have poorer seasons. Yes that is true but it more because of the squads that usually make Europa league being smaller and worse than CL teams. Everton would have probably been as poor if they had qualified for the CL because their squad just couldn't cope. Spurs don't even have an amazing squad but they manage to cope and have a better UEFA rank than us.

What jumps out at me from your previous post is this *""My diet is pretty poor and I am aware eating healthier may help them. The only acne cream my GPs gives tends to irritate my skin.""*

These are the two things to address next IMO, cosmetic products alone are often not enough.

Your skin is your largest organ, it will not function correctly if it is deprived of essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and so on. Research the healthy living guidelines, noting that they are minimums, maximums and serving sizes, NOT optimum nutrition. With sunscreen oily fish is particularly important: experts advocate up to four servings a week.

Part of the irritability of your skin may well be poor barrier function - keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out - underlying inflammation or wonky immune function ... these all link back to diet and lifestyle choices. You may also find /r/skindietandnutrition/ interesting.

Once you have that in place head back to your GP. There are multiple options on prescription, ask for a less drying or less irritating one.

by all measurements this migration will make Britain better of, both economically and culturally. It's a shame the political elite refusal to build homes - or rely on the rather hopeless private sector - and then blame shortages on migrants (the same goes for school places and the NHS 'crisis'). 

A report out the other day showed foreign students in London contribute effectively 70,000 jobs to London's economy. In fact most 'top' (i.e. Russell Group) universities make most of their money from - or off - foreign students (hence why the cuts to foreign students in the UK have been attacked by university managements). That funding for many top universities allows advanced technological and scientific research to be funded (when in turn helps British business). That said foreign students are seriously over-exploited and really only for the international rich class who can afford fees upwards of £20,000 (without grants). Not only that but tuition fees can change yearly; resulting in often increases that students are 'forced' to pay regularly bankrupting foreign families (foreign students aren't allowed for example to be 'self-employed'). 

The government seems to be playing ideological games with this whole issue. Typically the political elite in the consensus surround privatisation go about that policy - traditionally - by consistently underfunding public assets (for example this was done to nationalised rail). Underfunded, their service worsens, which becomes deceitfully an excuse for privatisation to 'provide a better service'. I fear this tactic is being used for what's left of public ownership: i.e. schools and the NHS. It's paradoxical that bad private results (i.e. the utter lack of housing in the UK) is rarely used as an excuse for government intervention or as a stick to beat the weakness of the private sector in definite areas. Instead the excuse is found that any problem is one of immigrants (despite the fact most migrants are way above school age, and thus not responsible for any shortage in school places)",null,0,null,1432234265,null,0,false,0,crgmg19,null,t3_36qhad,null,t1_crgmg19,null,t3_36qhad,null,null,null,1433192910,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

&gt;The __Webster ruling__ is a [test case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law\)) in association football [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_law) involving [Andy Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Webster), a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) formerly with [Heart of Midlothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [transfer regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(football\)) of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), football's [governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body), which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) of 1995 in its potential significance.

&gt;It's a completely irrefutable fact that NERC gives research grants to O&amp;G research, they openly state that on their website.

Also something I never claimed. NERC isn't research new methods of wellbore stimulation or cheaper formulations of drilling fluids. That was my point. They're not there to fund research into improving the profits of the O&amp;G industry or enlarging it.

As for the Doctoral Training Centre for Oil and Gas, all of their areas of research are environmental or ""How will XYZ be done in an environmentally acceptable manner"". As I said, they're not researching cheaper formulations of drilling fluids or designing new whipstocks or gas lift systems.

&gt;they are siphoning off money from public research council.

""Siphoning""? Christ, no...just no.

null,false,notfussed,null,null,null,"George Osborne has pledged to privatise £23bn of Government assets by the end of the next year in an attempt to bolster public finances and increase productivity.
The Chancellor announced the creation of a new company - UK Government Investments (UKGI) - to oversee a new wave of privatisations and ensure value for money for taxpayers.
Speaking to the CBI's annual dinner in London, Mr Osborne said: ""It is now within our grasp to make Britain the most prosperous country in the world, and the best place to do business.""
The privatisation push will include the sale of some or all of the Government's remaining 19.9pc stake in Lloyds Banking Group, assets held in UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), Eurostar, and parts of the pre-2012 student loan book.
Mr Osborne's desire to offload more of the Lloyds stake through a public share sale was one of the key economic announcements in the Conservative's election campaign.
UKGI will be formed from the merger of UK Financial Investments - which holds the public stakes in Lloyds, UKAR and the Royal Bank of Scotland - and the Shareholder Executive (ShareEx). ShareEx is currently housed within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and was responsible for the flotation of a stake in the Royal Mail two years ago. Other assets include Ordnance Survey and Companies House.

UKGI will ""deliver [the] biggest ever sale of publicly-owned corporate and financial assets in 2015-16, exceeding £23 billion in real terms for the first time,"" Mr Osborne told the dinner, made-up of 1,000 business men from across the country.
UKGI, which will be part of HM Treasury, is intended to make it easier for Government asset sales.
""Let’s get the government out of the business of owning great chunks of our banking system – and indeed other assets that should be in the private sector,"" said the Chancellor.
""To help that happen I can tell you that we’re merging UK Financial Investments and the Shareholder Executive into one organisation, to return government investments back to the private sector.
""Without fixing the public finances so our country lives within its means there can be no economic security for businesses or working people,"" he continued.
As part of the speech, he also focused on raising productivity, saying: “Let me be clear: improving the productivity of our country is the route to raising standards of living for everyone in this country. So by the Budget I will publish our Productivity Plan, our plan to make Britain work better. Our future prosperity depends on it.""
The Chancellor, who furthered his ""working people"" mantra, said that he has tasked Greg Hands, chief secretary to the Treasury, with writing to unprotected Whitehall departments - so not including education, health and overseas aid - ""to deliver the longer term target of £13bn of departmental savings by 2017/18.""
Those extra cuts will feature in the summer Budget, due on July 8.
Mr Osborne also announced that Ian McCafferty, one of the nine-strong committee of Bank of England interest rate setters, would be reappointed. The former CBI chief economist is considered to be one of the more ""hawkish"" of the nine, preferring rates to rise sooner rather than later.
Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank, said: ""I am very pleased that Ian McCafferty has agreed to serve another term on the Monetary Policy Committee. My colleagues and I on the Committee have greatly valued his insights into the range of issues affecting the UK economy over the past three years, and I look forward to continuing our work together.""",null,0,null,1432234746,null,0,false,0,crgmr54,null,t3_36s3to,null,t1_crgmr54,null,t1_crglzio,null,null,null,1433193055,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

But the real risk is private companies bidding for the lucrative work and leaving the NHS with the complex and high-risk work.  So the private companies make profits (because the system pays per procedure, so if you only take the simple, low-risk work, you make money), the NHS slides further into the red and if you are truly, dangerously ill then you end up with a worse service than you do now, or you have to travel a long way for it.

At my Trust, we are having to slash our services because we don't have enough money to fund them.  We are then also opening a private clinic (that will fund itself) to offer top up services.  So you might get physio, but if you want more sessions you'll have to pay.  Or you might get speech therapy, but if you want the evidence-based intensive service, you have to pay for it instead.  This is not a theoretical thing for the future, it has already happened!

There was an interesting (but scary) Radio 4 program last year looking at the community services run by private companies in East Anglia somewhere.  They identified that what had happened was that visits had got shorter, staff skill mix was biased towards more junior staff, leading to poorer clinical decision making and end of life care had particularly suffered because there wasn't time to deal with it.",null,0,null,1432234871,null,0,false,0,crgmu15,null,t3_36rwhw,null,t1_crgmu15,null,t3_36rwhw,null,null,null,1433193092,null,22,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,22,null

null,false,logopetria,null,null,null,"That depends on what you mean by ""privatisation"".  There's no reason to expect a wholesale privatisation where patients are given large medical bills to pay for routine treatments as in the US, since that would be enormously unpopular.  But there are at least two ways that the involvement of private healthcare companies might increase that you may be concerned about.

First: if less-urgent treatments are rationed (either by deliberate government policy decisions or just as an effect of budget constraints) then more patients will feel the need to go to private healthcare providers for these treatments.  Then in principle these treatments would still be available on the NHS (if you're willing to wait long enough) but in practice they're only available privately.

Second: if every component of the nation's healthcare system is provided by a private contractor, but everything is still branded ""NHS"" and is still free to patients at the point of delivery, would that count as the NHS being ""privatised""?  That's what's been gradually happening and is sure to continue under the present government.  

One reason you might be concerned about this latter prospect is simply that if a private company is extracting profits then that's money coming out of the government's allocated health budget that's not going to patient care.  There are other more general concerns about the continued hollowing out of public services and their replacement by private providers, which I'm sure other people in this thread can express better than I can.",null,0,null,1432235258,null,0,false,0,crgn2yb,null,t3_36rwhw,null,t1_crgn2yb,null,t3_36rwhw,null,null,null,1433193210,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

The site sucks and is difficult to navigate but the choice of shades in their foundation is unreal and it didn't break me out :D

**Shiro** - bought the entire There and Back Again collection in the pretty pots. Not really that impressed by the shades and after diving in head first to buy an entire collection it kind of made me leery of doing it again. Attempted to press it and I thought it worked out fine until everything went mouldy. Using glycerine as a binder and living in a damp flat make for an ugly combination.

**Alchimia Apothecary** - Customs stiffed me for £24 even though it was a tiny package. It had perfume on the customs label instead of the usual massage oils so that may have had something to do with it. People in IMAM raved but something about my skin made almost every scent I had just stink :( The only one I could wear had absolutely no longevity and disappeared in half an hour.

**4160 Tuesdays** - Urura's Tokyo Cafe and Dark Heart of Old Havana are my grown up scents. The first smells like refreshers/fruit salad chews and the second smells like sugary rummy warmth. I also signed up to her tester program and got a bitsy of every scent to test and write up. Such a good way to find a new favourite.

My current love and obsession - **Future Primitive Soap Company**. Today I have been mostly wearing Blackcurrant and Damson Frangipane Aromatic Oil (smells a bit like those old fashioned blackcurrant boiled sweets). I currently have nine different full-sized oils, eight soaps (3 currently unused) and five 3-in-1 Whipped Soaps and one condition rinse.

I may have a problem with how much I love Tiggys stuff.

This way Chelsea would build a strong English core for the future.

This is completely different to a communist utopia, where larger groups of people would work together as equals to fulfil common needs. There would be no hierarchy at all, everyone would be equal.

What kind of hikes do you have planned? It's still Winter conditions at the top of a lot of the hills but is milder further down so in terms of kit it depends what kind of thing you have planned? 

Regardless, I'd also recommend sleeping bag/mat, waterproof trousers, thermals, gloves, hat. It's been pretty cold!

Not sure about wild camping spots on Loch Ness but as part of the outdoor code open fires are generally discouraged, and cooking with gas is preferred. If you do however use an open fire, it expected that you'll collect dead wood and not cut down live trees for firewood. And even in that situation it's a ""leave no trace"" sort of attitude so obviously a big burnt out hole in the ground isn't ideal although that wouldn't be such a problem on sand. So a wee stove might be easier, or going to an actual campsite which allows fires.

For places in Glasgow that have kit, you'll find higher end stuff in the city centre in Tiso and Cotswolds and slightly cheaper stuff in Mountain Warehouse. There's also Go Outdoors in Clydebank which is a little further out but nice and cheap.

http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk is a great website for planning walks and hikes and provides routes however you'll still need maps which you'll be able to get at all of these outlets too, and Ordnance Survey maps are the most ubiquitous and probably easiest to use. 

P.S. ""In case of rain"" - I like your optimism :)

Regarding wild camping you should read [this](http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/Practical-guide/public/camping) and [this](http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/sites/default/files//docs/Guidance_-_Summary_guidance_on_fires_-_camping_-_4_June_2007.pdf). Here's some [Glasgow Outdoors shops](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutdoorScotland/comments/21ofdd/could_anyone_in_the_know_post_a_list_of_links_to/cgft118). You seem to be missing sleeping kit, and a paper map (OS 50k).

The correct etiquette when wild camping is to **Leave No Trace**. None. This may mean having your fire on the rocks at the side of the loch so as not to scorch a ring in the grass. Disperse any ashes or burned sticks in the morning and break up your ring of stones etc. Be exemplary!

Looking forward to your trip report, have a great time!

The reason clubs usually let players go when they ask for a move is for this reason - no club has been stupid enough to push it legally. The last two times it happen they got Webster and Bosman.

The other clubs in the EU are quietly telling Liverpool through gritted teeth to just let this one go.

They've resulted in a situation where a million families are having to use foodbanks - a meteoric rise that leaves the current situation considerably worse than a decade ago.

Hello Waffle: Good eyeshadow formula and selection of very pretty shades. Nice collections and themes. Tinted balms are so perfectly opaque they are lipsticks but the liquid lipstick I have feels so greasy and it never dries which is horrible. Not a fan of sparkles in face products but good selection of shades. Amazing customer service, Christine is lovely to talk to and has gone out of her way to help me more than once.


Future Primitive: Her whipped moisturisers are very thick so great for winter or dry skin. They take a long time to sink in though which is a pain. They don't feel greasy though. Some scents are overpowering and last till I shower, but the few I love always seem to disappear so quickly :( Not a fan of Tiggy's customer service because she never replied to an email I sent enquiring about availability. Ordered twice but probably won't order again, mainly because I can't seem to pick fragrances I love from her from the descriptions.


Femme Fatale: Oh my gosh the duochromes! Sahh pretty and minis are reasonably priced (plus the £ is strong compared to the Aus$ which makes them even more affordable). Shipping is always quick and Sophie is friendly and very helpful.


Fyrinnae: The owner is active on IMAM and his vast knowledge on cosmetic science/chemistry is very reassuring. TAT is never as long as stated and products are great quality. Eyeshadow formula is one of the best, the sticky base pixy epoxy is amazing for making all shimmery eyeshadows gleam and the lip lustres are amazingly pigmented and light feeling, even though they feather a lot on me.


Aromaleigh: Customer service was pretty short with me when I asked a question but the products are good. Most eyeshadows do need a sticky base to get the most out of them but the duochromes are so pretty. The themes they have are very unique. Samples are not as generous as other brands but still enough for several uses.


Blackbird Cosmetics: The pressed shadows and the loose shadows are ridiculously pigmented. If you like mattes then just go buy Maleah's stuff. Just go now. Such a cool range of shades and I really hope she brings more out! I have yet to try the face products but the powders are raved about.


MBA Cosmetics: I have only tried the lipsticks but they are such good quality and very reasonably priced, especially if you buy 3/6 at a time. Huge shade selection and they've recently brought a few new products out so I will order more soon. Disappointed with Bare because it was very sheer, but all other shades I've got are very pigmented, creamy and long lasting. A great way to try ""out there"" shades like blues and purples etc.


Common Brimstone: A UK perfume Etsy shop. I love how fresh and unique so many of them smell. The definitely have a signature, by which I mean I could blind sniff a perfume and know it's from them. Not a bad thing but a few are quite samey. If you like woodland scents definitely try them, although they don't have many gourmands. Great samples too because they are cute 2ml stopper bottles not awkward 1ml vials.


Shiro: I don't get the hype. Solid eyeshadow formula, and Caitlin is very friendly and helpful. You get sweets as well as samples in your order. But the shades are lacking something special. I never reach for the Shiro shadows I have. There's nothing wrong with them but I prefer my duochromes I guess. A very good brand to start with though as they are reliable, reputable and have a vast amount of shades, as well as face and lip products.


That's all I can think of off the top of my head. If anyone would like specific shade recommendations let me know and I'll reel off a few favourites :)


Edited to add a few more brands and also to mention that the TAT (turn around time) for the majority of indies will be a lot longer than what you are used to when you order from Debenhams or Boots etc. These are handmade cosmetics usually from a brand with just 1-2 people. The TAT is usually very transparent and easy to find but expect to wait up to a month for shipping confirmation and another 2-4 weeks for shipping if it's from abroad.

While the traditional ""bobby on the beat"" isn't helping crime stats, what it does is provide a visual reassurance that there is a law-enforcement presence in the locality. It's why police forces will generally have some form of ""fear of crime"" stat when producing yearly figures.

This is partially the reason they created PCSOs (rightly or wrongly) - to give the reassurance that there is a police presence on the streets, whilst allowing the ""real"" officers to get on with the actual business of solving crimes.

*edit* Just to tack on another point about /u/robert001 's post:

&gt;Well, I prefer (and I suspect Reddit users prefer) a science based approach to crime prevention

Intelligence-led policing has been the policing model since the 80s. Even the police aren't advocating a return to ""bobbies on the beat"". But ""science based approaches"" are more difficult to do when budgets are getting squeezed across the board. 

Also bear in mind that it's also not just police officers whose numbers have been dropping in the thousands, forces have also been cutting the numbers of support staff.

We may well sign another GK as well and with that I think our defense will be good enough. If we get the absolute minimum in the transfer window, Milner, Ings, a GK, we'll be a good team next season and I'd be hopeful for our top four chances. So no I don't think we need a 100 mil summer, anyone beyond those three would be a bonus in my eyes.

null,false,mushroomgodmat,null,null,null,"Well, you use a bike to get from A-B quicker or over a longer distance than walking.

Better question would be why so many motorists make life difficult for cyclists by making the roads dangerous for them? 

Edit - Ill expand on my answer a little bit...


When a motorist overtakes a cyclist in a shit manner - lets say speeding past with inches to spare it's in many ways similar to a cyclist doing the same to a pedestrians on a pavement. But no one ever questions the act of the motorist in these situations. Always it falls to the cyclist to defend their action. And I'm kinda fed up with that attitude.

So when someone simply suggests ""why cant cyclists walk?"", I have to ask why cant motorists drive normally? I mean, every day I get overtaken countless times perfectly. Then some fuck wit scares the crap out of you, nearly kills you and I think. Shit, why the fuck did that happen. I cant control that...Well, other than not to use that road that is.


So, yeah - later when I see some guy or girl on a bike, using a path avoiding the 40/50mpg ring road in Norwich, with traffic that dense and fast I cant really blame them for doing so. Could they walk. Sure they could. Could the motorists walk, drive correctly, be less aggressive. Sure they could.

The negatives of all this - They could hit someone else? Yep. Is that right? No, not remotely. But, its extremely, extremely unlikely anyone will be killed. And you know what, when some old grannies tootling down the pavement, shes not thinking, ""oh wow, lets go run over some pedestrians"" shes thinking ""thank fuck I didn't have to share that road with that HGV that just passed me at 40mph"".

If I had my way all cyclists would be on the roads. But then again, if I had my way the HWC would clarify the overtaking manoeuvre, motorists who are recorded nearly hitting cyclists (on purpose) would be punished. Speeding would stop, phone use would stop, tailgating would stop. But until those things happen, I cant blame anyone for trying to protect themselves. 

Id also like to point out, I have very little sympathy for cyclists who hit pedestrians either (in any situation). Its up to cyclists to avoid the people, those who don't im happy for them to be punished. in fact this is a good argument for strict liability. 

Finally - I dont cycle on pavement. I'm one of the few who is keen, and fit, and generally speaking can cycle at the speed comparable to cars.

You only have a few minutes to decide, because there are a *lot* of products which we need to decide how much to produce of.

After I got mine done he gave me trays for my teeth and gel to put in for an hour a day in the lead up to a date/event and they freshen up the teeth making them whiter again for longer.

I can message you the dental clinic I go to if you want (it's in London, Finchley Rd area). It cost me £350 which is the average price, and then I got the trays and gel (which I found out after were cheaper online) for £200.

No damage to teeth as long as you don't eat the types of food mentioned after for 48hrs due to them being sensitive you can get staining. After that you're good to do whatever. After getting it done though I've cut down on everything and only drink water with the odd coffee every other week so you got to have willpower to change habits otherwise it's a waste of money.

Hope all the info helps you decide, google around Zoom whitening and also check out Groupon as you get some offering it for £100, I've got them sometimes and gone elsewhere instead.",null,0,null,1432239828,null,0,false,0,crgq2iy,null,t3_36qz0p,null,t1_crgq2iy,null,t1_crgkcrz,null,null,null,1433194617,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I think the way he words his views about a lack of integration is important.

&gt; Now we are seeing the growth of positive forces acting against integration, of vested interests in the preservation and sharpening of racial and religious differences, with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population.

For one, the group of people he refers to in this case is the large amount of immigrants who came from the West Indies during the 1960s. This undermines his argument, as they haven't come to dominate British society. 

Secondly, he suggests the impetus for this lack of segregation and for domination comes entirely from within the immigrant community. This ignores the actions of British racists who opposed immigration simply because of skin colour, therefore making integration difficult. It scaremongers that all the negative impacts from immigration are due to the immigrants themselves. 

Furthermore, the example he uses for this domination is Sikh people wanting to retain certain customs, such as wearing turbans in the workplace. This hardly constitutes domination in my view, rather xenophobia. There is a difference between people wanting to retain some customs from their original country and people wanting to dominate society. 

On the difference between America and Britain, here is the full quote:

&gt; The Commonwealth immigrant came to Britain as a full citizen, to a country which knew no discrimination between one citizen and another, and he entered instantly into the possession of the rights of every citizen, from the vote to free treatment under the National Health Service. Whatever drawbacks attended the immigrants arose not from the law or from public policy or from administration, but from those personal circumstances and accidents which cause, and always will cause, the fortunes and experience of one man to be different from another's.

He denies there is any sort of discrimination based upon race, rather saying if an immigrant has misfortune, it is the same as any other person having a misfortune. It completely ignores the discrimination immigrants faced in the UK, like the Bristol Omnibus Company refusing to hire non-white drivers, political figures running on (or at least refusing to condemn) racist slogans like 'If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour', or nationalist far-right groups like the Union Movement and White Defence League lynching none-white and using now infamous phrases like 'Keep Britain White'. ( &lt;-- copy-pasted this from my other post). He's blaming immigrants for any sort of discrimination they face, which is completely ignorant of the bigger issues. Discrimination did exist in the UK before mass immigration. 

You also ignore him supporting the removal of the Race Relations Bill, which legally stopped discrimination based upon race. There is no correlation between opposing lack of integration, and opposing people being unable to ban people of certain races from their businesses.

&gt; When do the exams start? 

For each subject you're on a different exam board, so it varies: this year's IGCSE English Language was on the 5th of May, but if you're on a different exam board it might be later.

As you know, there's various coursework to do until that point. If you're doing IGCSE English Lang, that includes a speaking and listening exam as well, where you give a speech to an examiner. MFL also has various speaking exams (two for AQA).

&gt; How often are they?

Up to five a week. Normally two or three.

&gt; Do you ever take tests for 2 subjects a day?

Triple Science (at least for AQA) has the second and third units back to back, so that's two one-hour exams taking two hours in total, but that feels like one exam.

null,false,Creased_Carpet,null,null,null,"That isn't really true. What caused the crisis is the underestimation of default rates for bonds that were based on repackaged mortgages (sub-prime repacked so they were AAA rated). The fall in house prices was a secondary factor, they went down because when lenders realised they were more exposed they stopped lending, meaning houses could not be bought. This then did make the situation worse as banks couldn't recover as much from defaulted mortgages and the construction sector crashed as new houses stopped being built, but it wasn't the primary cause.

Minor point. Mortgages in the UK are a bit different from the US. If you walk away from your house in the US the bank takes the house and that's it, in the UK you are still liable if the house doesn't cover the mortgage amount. This means people are less likely to walk away from a house if it has negative equity in the UK.

This means that as long as the new houses are bought (and there is plenty of demand in the UK) and there isn't another recession caused by something else that means people can't pay their mortgages, the effect of a slight fall in house prices will be minor. Also the only houses which will have a risk of negative equity if they fall a bit are houses bought recently (as houses bought earlier will have increased in value so much), but as deposit amounts now tend to be much higher (~15% compared to ~0% for some sub-prime mortgages historically) there is also a larger buffer.",null,0,null,1432243217,null,0,false,0,crgs6ax,null,t3_36qhad,null,t1_crgs6ax,null,t1_crgepsh,null,null,null,1433195682,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Taure,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"&gt; That isn't really true. What caused the crisis is the underestimation of default rates for bonds that were based on repackaged mortgages (sub-prime repacked so they were AAA rated). The fall in house prices was a secondary factor, they went down because when lenders realised they were more exposed they stopped lending, meaning houses could not be bought. This then did make the situation worse as banks couldn't recover as much from defaulted mortgages and the construction sector crashed as new houses stopped being built, but it wasn't the primary cause.

I think you're missing part of the analysis here, though everything you say is true. People were defaulting more than banks thought they would but the thing is, if house prices had kept rising, then this would not have been a problem at all. The banks, or the mortgagors themselves, would have simply sold the houses. With a continued buoyant market, houses could have been sold relatively quickly. No massive losses, no liquidity crisis. With banks making a profit off the sales of the houses, no tightening of credit.

It wasn't defaults per se that caused the crash, it was mispricing the risk attached to those defaults. A huge factor which contributes to the calculation of that price is the value of the secured property. It was that bad valuation that underlaid the whole affair.

null,false,nabeshiniii,null,null,null,"I'm late to the party but I'm currently on the Fast Stream (Statistician specialism) and in my fourth year (about to go on promotion out of the scheme fairly soon). While I have done internships at an International Bank, my experience of the private sector is minimal for comparison.

To answer your questions:

1. Your degree doesn't really matter unless you want to go on a specialist scheme. Even then it may not matter for some specialisms. If you want to do generalist schemes, your degree ultimately shouldn't matter (2.1 is all that's needed). What we need from you is good reading, reasoning and mathematical comprehension. There are a bunch of personal skills like working in a team, making decisions based on evidence, delivering projects on time etc. that would really be useful. My suggestion is to pick one, get a good mark, make sure you get involved in a uni society where you contribute or run for one of the leadership positions and **ENJOY UNIVERSITY**.

2. I'm working within the DWP at the moment but I started off in a quango (an Education one). Can't really say much about what I do without leaking personal info. You'll find that every single department has its own culture and way of working, so working in the quango meant everything was hectic, high speed turnaround and people wanted things yesterday. Working in the much larger DWP meant that we had more opportunities to actually negotiate deadlines with colleagues and most of the time it's fine. Since I'm on a specialist scheme, my experience will be very different to a generalist. I have enjoyed my time working in both Departments and seeing how both function. You have the opportunity to jump between Departments if you're on a specialism (but beware HMRC, their contracts are...iffy for Fast Streamers) so it gives you opportunities to find out which Department suits you and whether you want to work in Transport or Education.

3. If you're interested in the acceptance rates to the Fast Stream, check out their [recruitment annual report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-fast-stream-report). the detailed analysis paper will tell you your chances of acceptance across Universities, degree programmes and which strand of the Fast Stream. As for skills and degree programme, it doesn't really matter on the generalist scheme. You'll need to have good grasp of maths, reading comprehension and problem solving skills (look up psychometric testing on Google to get a good idea of what will come up). For the specialist schemes, like the analytical or the commercial ones, you will find it helpful to have a degree in the subject but most will accept a good knowledge of their respective fields with BSc degree that has a good number of relevant mathematical modules.

4. You can have a look at the alternatives using the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers. As for long-term benefits, our pensions are good. Your final pension will be based on your average salary across 35-40 years of service. Every year you work in the civil service entitles you to an additional 2-3% of that average salary pension. Be aware that this will change as more reforms comes to the Civil Service. As for graduate pay, for inner London, it's pretty bad compared to the other graduate schemes (down 9.1% according to the Guardian) but that's mainly due to civil service pay freezes and the slightly lower pay for civil servants compared to the private sector. It also varies between Departments as well but you won't know your pay until you start (which IMO is a bit shitty). Your contract hours will vary between 36-42 hours depending on which Department. You get flexi-time (do more than your contracted ours then you can take the equivalent time off at another date on top of your leave). People are generally understanding of workloads and you will work with a lot of people who genuinely there to improve the country rather than make a profit. Your annual leave will be between 25-32 days depending on which Department you join. Paternity/Maternity leave (12 months) and childcare vouchers are available for some Departments. MSc funding and study leave are also available. So your lower pay is generally made up by slightly better benefits but these can vary wildly depending on which Department you join.

**tl;dr - **Fast Stream doesn't care about your actual degree as long as you meet minimum requirements from their website. Civil service is a good place to work but it may not be like that all the time. There's plenty of benefits for you over the private sector if you don't mind the below average market pay.

You talk about technological advancement making jobs obsolete as if it is a foregone conclusion. In reality, we as a society have the ability to choose what we prefer.

If we automate all these people out of a job and they are unemployed, what happens? They go onto benefits which working chumps like *you* are going to pay for through your taxes anyway. Since the rate of job creation has been pitiful of late, the fact that those people will likely remain on benefits will be no indictment of their willingness or ability to work, although I'm sure the media will helpfully spin a story which makes it sound like *everyone* out of a job is simply a lazy git.

Alternatively, we can decide *as a society* that we are happy to have people driving our trains so that they have something to do and don't have to sit around getting benefits paid for from your paycheck all day.

Further: you've made no move to dismiss the fact that you are a working person. I don't care if you are a street sweeper or an accountant. The facts are the same: if you work for a living you need to pull the same way as the rest of the workers. There is no benefit to you to pull the way of the wealthy elite because they will fuck you over as soon as the opportunity arises.

You are indeed correct that historical government policy does not alter fundamental rules of mathematics.

&gt; And it doesn't mean that there's scope in the welfare budget for those levels of cuts

Actually it does - if you look at the graphs £12bn is somewhere around 10% of the full number.

The bigger picture is that quality of life has never been higher on average. Employment is at an all time high. Fresh nutritious cheap food is available throughout the country. Entertainment is cheap and free. If you can't survive on benefits its because you are spending your money on things other than essentials.

There is no fundamental right to live off other peoples work or the state. If you expect the state to support you indefinitely then it is inevitable that you will feel pressure against that idea. Its tragic that this leads some people to suicide but that is undoubtedly a mixture of mental health problems and cultural maladjustments.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"The thing is, we won't be able to attract anyone better yet; that's not an insult to Ings/Austin or Hernandez, but there is a level of young up-coming striker I'd love us to be aiming for but we'd never get (much like Depay last year), and also prolific (lets say someone at Sturridge's level, not necessarily a title winner in a ""top"" team, but when playing is a hell of a player, probably decent European level).  

In the absence of the ability to attract that sort of player, I'd rather go with Ings for his ties to Southampton and his age - he can still develop, manage to learn different play styles etc - and is going to be going extremely cheap (free + compensation). Austin would also be good, and at least he would stop sodding scoring against us, and as everyone knows he scored an incredible number of goals for a frankly terrible QPR side and if he did that for us it could be the difference - but we've got to assume that Pellé is still going to be our no. 1 striker, and I don't know if Pelle + Austin would ever work, or if either would be happy being benched often enough for the other.  

This same problem applies to both Ings and Hernandez. Hernandez I don't know about at all, don't know he'd work hard enough for us, might think he's better than a club our level, pretty sure he's said he wants game time at a CL team etc, and don't know we'd get him cheap despite his lack of any reasonable game time of late. Ings also has said he'd only go somewhere he can get game time, not sit on a bench, and would he play over Pelle? Could we use Ings as a wide striker, same as Rodriguez and Long, and then have enough rotations of players that can play in those sorts of positions (wide striker, front man, 2 striker partnership)?  

Lots of questions, and I don't know what the answer is. The other thing is also that maybe Rodriguez will come back, and Gallagher and Seager will be able to step up a bit more often in cup games. Bit more rotation with those two in league games, or maybe Rodriguez can be the front man? He used to play there at Burnley all those years ago, every chance he'd still be capable. Maybe he's spent a bit of his injury time bulking up top side for a good battle with CB's? Gallagher will need to do the same, Seager will need to prove he can make the step up, use his speed and agility to beat CB's as he obviously won't be able to do it with his strength.

That 120bn figure comes from http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/campaigns/national-campaigns/tax-justice/why-are-they-increasing-the-tax-gap.cfm

The only arguments I know of for reducing CT is that it eventually trickles down, thus giving people more money to spend increasing tax revenue from the bottom, though I've seen plenty argue this isn't the case and that trickle down economics simple doesn't work.

A person comment on that would be that a reduced a companies tax bill, the savings, if evenly split between employees (which lets face it, it wouldn't be, a huge chunk would just be extra profit) would be minimal.

I think a society that provides services that we all use is a much richer one.  Not just in the NHS but a renationalised train service for example.  Companies wouldn't be profiting off of rail fares and the Government can help reduce cost to passengers.  So ensuring companies pay what they are supposed to, and providing those sorts of public services (this is what I was alluding to in my initial comment by the way) would do better at redistributing wealth as everyday costs are reduced.

It also benefits those that are out of work better, because the costs of getting back into work (travelling to interviews for example) is reduced so their fairly meagre JSA payment goes a bit further.

&gt; I like being business friendly to create jobs etc but believe companies can pay more

This is the thing, we need to find a nice healthy balance.

* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)

* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).

It is not a ""problem"" then, and it isn't now. I can only suggest that anyone who believes it to be should go away and read [Seasons of War](http://www.seasonsofwaranthology.co.uk/).

The problem was not ""ohh, now I've got to resolve that too"", but ""ohh, how can I include another regen, since we're so close and this would the best possibly opportunity to start again"".

You may be fine with ensuring that there are people driving trains, but with that comes a big part of the reason that fares so high: because labour costs have grown faster than TOCs can absorb them, and the fact that we're running more services than ever requiring an increase in operational employment. This means more money being spent on capital expenditures as well that is borne through greater amounts of tax money needed to fund Network Rail. 

Since this was a London-focused reply, the RMT has managed to irritate the hell out of Londoners by using threats of striking as a means of getting their way, or in worst case shutting down the city on an increasingly regular basis. To think that this is necessarily about working standards is also naïve; it's about getting even more money. I'm not trying to demean real issues, but I'm being realistic. I guess I'll get downvoted strongly for not supporting blatant attempts at money grabs, but oh well. All this does is minimise the public's sympathy for when most would agree that strike action is appropriate due to serious concerns about worker safety and underpayment. 

And to your point about employment growth being ""pitiful,"" I'd like to point out that London has experienced ~3pc employment growth over the past year, which is a very strong figure, while all other regions are positive and most above 1.0pc. Private sector employment is up more than 2pc across regions, which is perfectly healthy. That will only increase over the next two or so years, so to say that they'll all end up staying on benefits indefinitely is unfounded.

I suggest you give  [brouter](http://brouter.de/)  a go which is specifically for cycling. There's an android app (you will need another app to to show the maps as it's *just routing*) but you can [use it online](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) too.

On the web version you can change the mapping layer (top right) - the opencyclemap layer can be quite useful to show the allocated cycleroutes.

You can find the actual definitions of the routing profiles [here](http://brouter.de/brouter/profiles2/), but 'safety' sounds like what you want. Skimming it suggests it avoids  *ways* which aren't tagged for cycling in some way:

No it doesn't, but it does highlight the fact that English clubs habitually overpay for English players. I believe the Sterling transfer would be highly inefficient, paying £40m for a 20-year old (not to mention £150k wages) who has had one good season (and a host of off-field issues) is not worth it. Especially considering the alternatives £40m could buy.

&gt; Sterling is 20, and this was only his second season playing in the EPL

So being 20 isn't old or experienced enough to play to your ability, but is old enough to command a £40m and £150k wages (twice Oscar and Willian's wage might I add). How many times have we seen young players had money they haven't justified thrown at them, have it all go to their head, their performances plummet and they become daily food for the tabloids. This has that written all over it. Yes, false equivalence again, but on the weight of evidence (his numerous tabloid incidents this year, this latest contract incident, the decision to play out the contract incident in the public domain) and his frankly average footballing exploits this year I cannot see how that fee and those wages are at all justified.

If this government cared 1 iota about your ability to commute to work for a reasonable price they would simply subsidise the system more. What does it tell you that they are quite happy to let prices rise and impose the cost on people like you instead of the super-rich?

&gt;the RMT has managed to irritate the hell out of Londoners by using threats of striking as a means of getting their way, or in worst case shutting down the city on an increasingly regular basis

So what do you suggest they do instead? Simply hope like hell that their working conditions will improve? I really don't understand why it would irritate another working person, such as yourself, to see workers improving their lot in life.

&gt;To think that this is necessarily about working standards is also naïve; it's about getting even more money.

Remuneration is a condition of work to my mind. I don't think we should get sidetracked by a semantic issue like this though.

&gt;I guess I'll get downvoted strongly for not supporting blatant attempts at money grabs, but oh well. All this does is minimise the public's sympathy for when most would agree that strike action is appropriate due to serious concerns about worker safety and underpayment.

I'm not downvotign you. I think it is important for people like you to think very hard about *why* an industrial action is upsetting you. To reiterate: from the viewpoint of the toffs at the top you are indistinguishable from a rail worker. That is true whether you are working in a shop or if you are an accountant. You are just a little worker bee. If you get irritated that your fellow workers in another sector are working together to improve their lot, maybe you need to be honest about why that is. Is it that you don't work in an occupation where unionisation is prevalent? Many professionals have this problem. It is then an issue of ... envy perhaps? I cant't answer the question for you, but I do think you need to understand why you are currently siding with a wealthy elite on this issue who don't give a damn about you.

&gt;And to your point about employment growth being ""pitiful,"" I'd like to point out that London has experienced ~3pc employment growth over the past year, which is a very strong figure, while all other regions are positive and most above 1.0pc.

I've even heard veteran fans correct themselves with ""My Doctor is Ten, I guess technically Eleven."" That's how its relevant. Annoyances are fine, but this one was unnecessary. 
2) Since this is used to justify the count thing, it's kind of important. It's not so much he doesn't have a definite name as he doesn't have an alternate name. There's no mystery aspect at work, otherwise someone would have asked ""what do I call you?"" like they've done a dozen times before. Think of it this way, Tenent was annoyed that he was being credited as ""Doctor Who"" even though he was called ""The Doctor"". Well, was Hurt ever referred to as ""War Doctor"" on screen? Or in those books for that matter?
3) McGann's single outing wasn't planned. Like the two other Docs before him, his time ended prematurely. Hurt, on the other hand, was deliberately written as a one-off. And requiring fans to read supplementary material to get the full story is a weakness for the source material, not a strength. Furthermore, the very same war stories could have been written about 8.
4) I don't understand your point on this one. If the War Doctor hadn't been created, 11's regeneration would have just been business as usual. Once it was all said and done, that's all it was. It's true that starting a new cycle was inevitable, but I would argue there would have have better time for it in a story that wasn't overcrowded with other resolutions.

Grant had been brought in as a director of football - which started the rumours about him being Roman's mate and all - and results weren't great. 

One of the stories goes something like: Roman makes a casual comment about he hopes performances can improve, which ruffles Jose's feathers and he responds with a 'if you don't like it sack me' attitude, to which Roman replies he can leave if he wants, so he does.

 ""For too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens: as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone. It’s often meant we have stood neutral between different values. And that’s helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance.""

""This government will conclusively turn the page on this failed approach. As the party of one nation, we will govern as one nation, and bring our country together. That means actively promoting certain values.""

""Freedom of speech. Freedom of worship. Democracy. The rule of law. Equal rights regardless of race, gender or sexuality.""

""We must say to our citizens: this is what defines us as a society. To belong here is to believe in these things. And it means confronting head-on the poisonous Islamist extremist ideology. Whether they are violent in their means or not, we must make it impossible for the extremists to succeed.""
David Cameron 13th May 2015

""The twisted narrative of extremism cannot be ignored or wished away. This government will challenge those who seek to spread hatred and intolerance by forming a new partnership of every single person and organisation in this country who wants to defeat the extremists.""

""We will introduce legislation to combat groups and individuals who reject our values and promote messages of hate. We will empower institutions to stand up against the extremists and challenge bigotry and ignorance. And we will support those who are fighting back against extremism online.""

""United by our values and the basic principles of our society we are determined to defeat extremism in all its forms.""
Theresa May 13th May 2015

It's the use of the word ""Extremist"" with no definition which worries me.

This current bunch of lack wits don't particularly bother me. I get the distinct impression most of them are only in Parliament in order to line up some cushy directorships in order to pad out the old retirement fund, what truly worries me is some bright spark running wild with ill conceived and poorly written legislation.

I agree that we have to be realistic as to the calibre of striker we can sign. We're not going to go out and get a top European striker.  
  
Regarding Rodriguez, although he has played as a striker before, he's played a very different role from that which Koeman needs in his 4-3-3. When Rodriguez has played the lone striker before, he's played on the shoulder of defence, looking to run in behind and stretch play. But with Koeman's 4-3-3, we need our central striker to occupy defenders, bring the defence up the pitch and create space for the wide forwards who can run in behind. However much Jay might have bulked up whilst being away, I don't think he will have gained the hold-up skills to play that role.  
  
Anyway, I think you might have a point about Ings. I don't think I've seen him enough to know whether he could fill in for Pelle in that role. But I would be very surprised if he doesn't go to Liverpool, so I'm not sure he's a viable option.

I had to think about this because I don't think it's true at all. 

Barca definitely have a better pass and completion rate than us, but there are no stats out there to support your assertion that they cross more. In fact, statistically in that regard, they're a long way behind us. 

What they do get though, is _a lot_ more fouls given for them than we do and I think that makes a massive difference. 

I don't think there's a shortage of crosses from us, but there has in the past been a shortage of players who can attack a cross since Drogba left, and even he can't do it now because he doesn't have the same turn of pace to leave a defender the way he used to. 

I see a lot of criticism of our crossing, but that's never been the issue for me.

null,false,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,null,"&gt; No it doesn't, but it does highlight the fact that English clubs habitually overpay for English players. I believe the Sterling transfer would be highly inefficient, paying £40m for a 20-year old (not to mention £150k wages) who has had one good season (and a host of off-field issues) is not worth it. Especially considering the alternatives £40m could buy.

You are arguing against a few different points here. Firstly, I don't know which host of off-field issues you're referring to. [I have already discussed this point earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/36r96q/sterlings_agent_suggests_potential_chelsea_move/crgdcui), so if its his contract issues, please read my linked post.

Second, its not that English clubs have a habit of overpaying for English talent, its about the English media over hyping British players. That's all well and good, but in Sterling's case, I have watched him since he was in Liverpool's U18 team and trust me when I say this, the guy has more potential than any English player to come through in recent times. 

Third, nobody is going to pay him £150k p/w. In fact, there is a good chance he won't even get £100k p/w at his new club. And £40m would be the max I'd bid for him. Personally, I still think that would be great value for money, because you just know that in 3-4 years time Real Madrid or Barca are going to be willing to pay at least twice that amount.

&gt; So being 20 isn't old or experienced enough to play to your ability, but is old enough to command a £40m and £150k wages (twice Oscar and Willian's wage might I add). How many times have we seen young players had money they haven't justified thrown at them, have it all go to their head, their performances plummet and they become daily food for the tabloids. This has that written all over it.

Based on what exactly? I don't think you are measuring this situation based on his talent, rather on the fact that he is demanding more money.

&gt; Yes, false equivalence again, but on the weight of evidence (his numerous tabloid incidents this year, this latest contract incident, the decision to play out the contract incident in the public domain) and his frankly average footballing exploits this year I cannot see how that fee and those wages are at all justified. My opinion. Lets agree to disagree

Now I'm starting to believe that you have some sort of personal agenda here. Firstly, I don't know how you consider a 20 year old, who is only in his second year in the league that scores 7 goals and has 7 assists as someone who isn't playing to his ability. I really don't get it. Oscar has 6 goals and 8 assists this season. Your argument is hinged on the opinions of a few of your Liverpool buds who have said he didn't show up in the big games. Well, he did show up in the big games last season. So what's changed since last season? Maybe its the fact that Liverpool played without a proper striker for most of the season? Do you not remember how our players struggled with that last season?

And I still don't know what you are referring to when you say ""his numerous tabloid incidents"". And you haven't even watched him to be able to justify saying he's been average. [**HERE**](http://i.imgur.com/gLMdCUD.png) is a comparison of his stats vs Hazard's first season; and [**HERE**](http://i.imgur.com/NW2RfXX.png) is a comparison of his stats from this season vs Hazard's this season.

You can also try speaking to the HR department for the hospital, if they do short term lets often, they may also have some suggestions.

As mentioned, Cherry Hinton is a pretty good place to live; close to your place of work, close to the supermarket, bus routes into the city, and within cycling distance of all of the above if you don't drive/hate the bus.

Fulbourn itself is also pretty close, unsurprisingly, and is probably a better choice if you prefer somewhere a little outside the city. There's still a bus route available, and it's only an extra mile or two out of town from Cherry Hinton. Not as many places for rental, as far as I'm aware, but a few do spring up on occasion.

A little further afield from the hospital is the area between Queen Edith's Way and Cherry Hinton Road, towards the Cherry Hinton end - there are also bus routes available on both of these roads, and they are also within easy cycling distance.

Do yourself a favour and buy a cheap second hand bike and a D-lock if you plan to live in these areas: I work around the same area, and the cycle is pretty easy, and if you were thinking about driving, traffic can be horrendous during rush hour. If you do choose to get a bike, a D-lock should be the minimum you go for, as the high cycle usage in Cambridge means that bike theft is pretty high compared to other cities.
