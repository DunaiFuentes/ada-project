null,false,theinspectorst,null,null,null,"Bear in mind that the Tories just won their largest share of the vote in 23 years and the SNP their largest share of the vote ever. The Tories are also now embarking on a difficult five years in government, without their Lib Dem lightning rod to take the blame, but with their own top issue on the agenda being the one issue they have historically tended to tear themselves apart over - Europe.

The base case is therefore that both of those parties will win fewer votes (probably considerably fewer) in 2020 than they won in 2015, and voters will most likely drift to the 2nd-placed party in their constituencies.

On that basis, I honestly think the first 12 of those seats are likely to go Lib Dem at the next election - in all cases we face majorities of under 4,000, and 11 of the 12 are held by the Tories or SNP (the other one is Cambridge, held by Labour by a few hundred votes).

Beyond that it's more difficult in 2020, but we're still disproportionately facing Tory or SNP MPs, not Labour. If we only get our vote share back into the mid-teens then we'll be well-positioned in the next 20 seats (maybe more) for the subsequent election.

To illustrate my point, I've done some uniform swing calculations based on the following GB + Scotland scenarios at the 2020 election, which really don't involve dramatic change in vote shares relative to 2015:

* GB: CON 34%, LAB 31%, LD 14%, UKIP 12%, Green 3%.

* Scotland: CON 13%, LAB 24%, LD 14%, UKIP 2%, Green 1%, SNP 46%.

This would result in 22 Lib Dem MPs, 117 Lib Dem runners up, and zero lost deposits. Of the Lib Dem runners up, 14 would be within 2,000 votes and the next 7 would be within 4,000 votes - making them very strong targets for 2025.",null,0,null,1432844583,null,0,false,0,cro1iz5,null,t3_37lxw3,null,t1_cro1iz5,null,t3_37lxw3,null,null,null,1433321256,null,3,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,3,null

I'm not arguing that Colkett is a box to box midfielder. I said he's not one.

I tried telling someone that he is not a left winger as he told me to replace him with NATHAN, who if you look at my lineupbuilder is playing on the left. I said when I've seen him he plays as a RWer. Is he correct to say that he should be a winger AND on the left at that? ""When he is not a winger in the first place?"" he didnt say replace Abrahams with Solanke he said swap him with Nathan.

MvG is not a no10 hes put in a midfield 3 and his box is slightly higher because i didnt want his name to overlap the Musonda box. If I wanted to show him as a no10 I would have done it like this http://imgur.com/uQu8h4U rather than this http://imgur.com/kVDFglu 

RLC is a midfielder to the right of the person in the middle. i'm not calling him a RWer, if theres a problem with him being there let me know though.

But you're ignoring / missing the point by focusing on that. Most of the 'reasons' for not wanting gay marriage are the same ones trotted out for interracial marriage 60 years ago. If someone said that they had 'reasons' for being against interracial marriage, you'd probably find that appalling; but 'reasons' for being against gay marriage isn't met with the same kind of response. Despite the fact both are about the idea that people should be free to marry whoever they want.

I did it at UCL, which has an outstanding course for it. Many universities in Europe focus a lot on sociolinguistics (the effects of society on language) and applied linguistics, whereas US universities, along with UCL, Cambridge, and many others tend to look more at the theoretical science behind the structures of langauge. It's all linguistics, just with a different focus. 

I personally liked how because linguistics is such a young field (seriously, I never cited anything older than the 40s, and anything before the 70s was rare) by even the second year of the course we were already getting into current debates in linguistics. By the end of the final year, we were pretty consistently looking at the future of the field, and what might need researching now, rather than just learning what the theories are. It was very interesting and exciting for me, because there's so much that's being developed and discovered all the time with it.

If you're interested in linguistics, have a look over at /r/linguistics. We've got some good posters over there, and you can get a bit of a feel for what the subject is like.

As another note - law is pretty good for looking at current issues too. While there's certainly less of that than there was in linguistics for me, there's been so much in just my first year which forces you to form opinions on the way the law is and what it might be like in the future. For something you always think of as ""solid"", the law sure is uncertain in a number of areas, which can be quite interesting and fun to learn about.

Really, regions not been so engulfed in flame since the Arab nations last dog piled Israel. Hell its arguably worst. 

&gt;Are you really trying to tell me that you think ISIS pose a long term threat?

Yes, AQI surivied to make a state. These are hard fucking men. Will they suceed in expanding much beyond their current borders. Hopefully not. What i'm saying is they are nearing on having a capacity of actually being in striking distance of Italy. Mostly in a futile sense. But low tech swarm tactics work. 

 &gt;While they might be doing okay on the ground they're awful at diplomacy which makes them a dead country irrespective of their current gains.

Are they, with all that qatari money and Turkey turning a blind eye for so long, really?  Or that they have united half the worlds salafist millitants in two years?

You and I find them repugnant, don't make the mistake of thinking the entire world see's them that way. 

&gt;It can't and won't last.

Who is going to end them? What is the relatively near end game? 

&gt;If anything the fact that they're so committed on the ground means they have less resource to put onto western soil and less focus.

As I've said, I don't envision a land invasion any time soon.

But getting a couple of guys with AK's into Milan, or Barcelona. 

Yeah, that's doable. Maybe even Manchester or London if they try enough times. 

The Land stuff is just so scary, because they keep capturing resources and a taxable managable population and holding them. 

&gt;Maybe but the fact there is a state to defend makes them a much more ""solid"" and managable problem than the stateless Al-Queda that came before.

No, spesifically there are 3, arguably 4 Fronts.

One in Syria, they are making a major push into the Alawaite homelands on the coast. They are making steady gains. If they take it, not if but when Goverment finally collapses. Then we are talking Israel, Lebanon and Jordan. regional war spread enough for you yet?

Ok, maybe not. Then there is the Shia + Kurd v Sunni front. Lets be real on what that really is. Imagine the humanitarian nightmare if they take Baghdad in a future offensive. The entire Mosul offensive has been fucking halted by what is it 150 guys? 

No they won't beat Iran. But Iran has allready deployed *most* of its Al Quds force *and* massively expanded it with Iraqi's. They are capable, by the looks of it, at holding Iraq propped up 

So thats a fairly large area. Which withotu Turkish intervention or even fucking help. Has a nice sizable resource rich interior. We can bomb, but its not working at this level of commitment because we won't slaughter civilians on mass with carpet bombing. 

Thinking you can't win a major war with mobile infantry rocking technicals with 80's and 90'ies era AT and AA on them. IS like armoured nights scoffing at mogol horse archers.  People are scoffing at this, they outmanuver and push back large, well equiped armed forces as well as win grinding conventional warfare against them too. 

Now, why can't this war machine fund asymetric and covert warfare beyond its boarders. God knows it appears to the manpower and money.

Then we get to libya. Did it again, won the war completely lost the peace. cyrenaica is allmost gone.

Question then, can you, with thouse resources get a couple of guys with AK's into Italty or Greece?

&gt;Which is hilariously ironic given the roots of ISIS and the preferred outcome of attacks for the West.

If they can execute attacks in the Shia part of the Kingdom, the forsemost Millitary power and Security state in the Region arguably so compared to much of the world. **Serious question, where is the hard limit of what they can do and why?** ",null,0,null,1432845979,null,0,false,0,cro2f32,null,t3_37ktov,null,t1_cro2f32,null,t1_cro1m27,null,null,null,1433321676,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Tammy can play on either wing, it doesn't matter who he replaces, the point still stands he is a striker. Usually if all 3 of Solanke, Brown and Tammy play then Tammy plays out left. It's just very rare that happens because Tammy played most of his games for the u18's whilst Solanke and Brown played most of their games for the u21's and u19's whilst Tammy only played a small role in both of those and likewise the other two only played small roles for the u18's. Plus I don't think the point he was making was that he wanted Tammy on the left, I think he just wanted Tammy to replace Allen instead of Boga, you could then quite easily put Boga on the left and Tammy on the right, it's not rocket science.

I'm not saying he is number 10, I'm saying putting him in a more advanced position is what's causing the confusion. Either way, number 10 or no number 10, MvG should be the box to box or even RLC, Musonda is the least likely to play box to box out of those 3, although he can still do it. Also, why would you have put the number 10 on it if it was representing the number 10? It's not like you put numbers on any of the other ones... Like I said anyway, you still listed RLC as an MR. Just like DL and DR are fullbacks, MR and ML are wide midfielders.

For all their flaws, and there's many, I think they're relatively patient. We, as supporters aren't. They're not as, not sure if it's the right word, but, *committed* to Liverpool as we are. 

Personally, I think it's time to cut their losses, get someone else in, whilst options are available (Klopp), because if Rodgers stays and doesn't turn it around, he'll be sacked next year, and I doubt Klopp, or someone of his ability is unattached to a club still by then.",null,0,null,1432846329,null,0,false,0,cro2ni9,null,t3_37mwsj,null,t1_cro2ni9,null,t1_cro2cta,null,null,null,1433321786,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

As for the impact on corruption, I don't think it will make much difference. the whole organization has corruption running through it and the man in charge of it all is still there. It will be tougher for them to be so corrupt, but It will still go on.

What you'll find with law if you do go into it is that it's not even just odd cases that are the issues, but the whole area of the law. My lecturers keep saying stuff to the effect of ""In real life the law is easy and the facts are hard, in university the facts are easy and the law is hard"". Basically, it's because in real life the ""issues"" in law don't come up very often, but they're key to law as an academic field.

For instance (without going into the law too much), there's a whole thing about whether you can withdraw acceptance of a contract after you've given it but before the other party has read your acceptance. It's a question that frankly there *isn't* an answer to in English law yet. In real life, those circumstances don't come up very often at all, and even if they do they barely ever go to court over it, so there's no authority on the issue. It's not an odd case where you're trying to work out how to apply the law, but a situation where you have to work out what the law even is or should be.

What irritates me about this stuff sometimes is that, while in linguistics where there was an unanswered question, you could try and come up with a way to find the answer, in law the most you can do is weigh up the various arguments either way and then wait for a case to make it to a high enough court. There's no way of going out and testing whether your right (without trying to orchestrate a certain court case, I guess).

Everton had finished 4th with us in 5th, and it was only as the result of a rule change that summer that Liverpool qualified as winners for the tournament the following season.

False. Something I would expect from an Evertonian, but not from a Liverpool supporter.

It used to be the case that the defending champions automatically got a place in next years competition. That was changed only because of the Marseille bribery scandal. The year Marseille won the European Cup, they were caught bribing a domestic team to go easy on them, prior to the final. Marseille were relegated, but as Euro champions, they still had their guaranteed spot in the following years European Cup.

It was ONLY to avoid this embarrassing situation from reoccuring that UEFA removed the automatic spot for the defending champions.

The intentions was ALWAYS that the defending champions would STILL be nominated by their FA, if they failed to qualify by other means. That was the intention. Publically stated. The removal of the automatic qualification was only intended to give the domestic FA the option of enforcing a ban for domestic corruption reasons (eg: Marseille).

So, when Real Madrid missed out on a top 4 La Liga position, but still won the Champions League, the Spanish FA sent Real back to the Champions League next season. And no-one batted an eyelid - BECAUSE THATS WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

The English FA (and Everton) were dishonest little fuckers, and tried to pull a fast one at Liverpool's expense. UEFA expected Liverpool in next years tournament all along. The FA instead left Liverpool out, embarassed UEFA, all in the hope of getting 1 extra team into the Champions League.

In the end, UEFA allowed Liverpool back in, because it was ALWAYS the intention that the defending champions should defend their trophy. 

And then UEFA closed that loophole, so that the English FA couldn't try that dirty trick again.

We EARNED that spot. We knew it. UEFA knew it. Everyone in Europe knew it. Everton sneaked in, by dishonestly exploiting a loophole. Screw them. They got knocked out in the qualifying round anyway. Justice served!

So Rafa DID earn that spot. Period.

They've also been ruthless with our managers before and I can see it happening again. Hodgson was axed after a few a games, and Kenny was axed because we got 7th, although we got to two finals and won a cup.

We finished 6th and failed to get to a final this season, I think they like Rodgers more than they liked Kenny but I wouldn't be surprised if they axe Rodgers for Klopp.

null,false,zephyrus-,null,null,null,"hey- there are some major differences in our education and yours.

for you, the major hurdle is fees, as you will pay international fees, but  its the basically amount you'd to go to harvard as an out of state student, and for a year less. PLUS you can drop all that high school stuff like trig and biology cos hey- you're paying to study french literature. providing your parents can afford that (i guess $40-45 pa, inc flights, food, rent, fees)... welcome! your reasons for coming here sound mature and well thoughtout- props for not saying 'i wanna party in london, lol'.

so, the Russell group unis are great bang for your buck. uni fees, even for internationals, are capped. there's a bit of difference between uni's, but rarely more than about £7k- i.e., the amount you'd pay for the same subject degree at 10 different uni's won't vary by more than £7k between cheapest and most expensive, last time i looked.

unis have a cap on the number of internationals they can accept, so while imperial, UCL really are top russell group unis, because they are in london they will attract more applicants, cos everyone thinks london is pretty much all the uk has to offer. 
bristol (1.5 hrs from london and a great city and uni) is also russell gp, but cos americans mainly want to come to london, has a slightly lower number of applicants per place; so it'd be easier to get into. if you look at the rankings of international uni's, its usually oxford, harvard, icl, cambridge, yale moving up or down a place each year in the top 5; anyone who thinks uk uni's are a soft touch is wrong. they are just as tough as american ones.

classes are different too; you're taught in some seminars, mainly classes (5, 10, 15, 20 people) and some tutorials. its more personal.

you can also do a split degree (joint honours), tho this is offered by the uni, rather than being a pick n mix choice for you. its usually two comparable subjects, sometimes 3 - e.g., politics, philosophy and economics is popular for entering politics.

there are also FAR FEWER exams, and the earliest start will be 9. my classes began at 10 (because we are civilised). i know some american colleges begin at- ouch- 7am.

other stuff to consider; no greek life, sports is almost irrelevant, few scholarships to help you if you need aid. uni's will have a list of scholarships on this page for US students, inc awards from the US.

a weird thing to consider is the architecture/structure of uni life. some won't have a campus like you'd expect, but instead buildings spread through a city, giving it less of an enclosed, single community feel. that said, if the university is large enough, the students take over an area anyway, so places like manchester feel identifiably 'university'  when you're near by, even without the cloistered architecture of oxford and cambridge which is traditionally associated w uni life. we have no CCs or reductions in fees for studying locally, so people tend to move away from home for uni... meaning a higher % of people away from parental control. like you, they won't know anyone else when they start, so you won't stand out in any way : )
oh and halls (dorms); single rooms. unless you choose to share, though why would you.

uni's here won't really care about how many teams you're on in HS, tho american colleges will, so don't drop out; its just not a thing here. your entry here will be on your SAT/ACT and predicted scores. ideally you'd have APs relevant to the course, but not all schools offer them, so don't stress. look at international students pages for relevant uni's, and see their requirements. an example~ http://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/international/country-specific-information/usa.htm?page=2  

its true you can switch courses, even uni's, but don't bank on it.
anyway, once you're here, you can work up to 20 hrs a week term time (term= semester), full time in holidays (vacations). you get free healthcare. applying is simpler too~ you choose 5 uni's in terms of preference, then fill in a form and pay a fee to UCCAS, who take over from there. one fee, one form. i think its about £50 or 60. there is no early entry, no separate sending in of applications, no gigantic essay to write, just one form and a personal statement.

england is VERY small- i think the farthest cities are 6 hrs by train to london. plus all cities have airports so you fly/train into europe for weekends cheaply- $70 return to paris, etc.

the uk actually does pretty well in the tech sector~ the inventor of the internet and iPod are both brits, and loads of CG work for tv and film (GOT, gravity etc) is done here. plus we make cool shit like the raspberry pi. unusually, webdesign and some IT jobs are on the skills list, so if you want to move here permanently afterwards, or even with an american IT degree, you'd stand a chance, whereas your mate with an english major? not so much.
there is a strict list of areas- computing, medicine, engineering and so on, are open to non EU workers. this'd be the roughly the same for any EU country, btw, so its handy to know you'd be entering a career you could take anywhere. most jobs, even high level, won't be open to non EU nationals (the US does the same to us, btw).

oh- and you can drink yourself into unconsciousness from the age of 18 onwards. 

culturally, before you cmd, find out about the uk... you can listen to uk radio free online- bbc radio 1 is general pop, dance etc http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1 1 extra is more dance/hip hop,a nd bbc6 music is more alternative and retro (all are ad free). xfm is indie/alternative. radio 4, and radio 4 extra, are history, books, politics, comedy etc.

the guardian is a decent newspaper, read that. the daily mail is our fox news- evil, reactionary and horrible. do not read it.
you can find pretty much all uk tv shows to watch online (illegally, i should warn you). we're much more sarcastic, self depreciating and yeah.. just different to you.

null,false,confusedpublic,null,null,null,"&gt;The likes of Borini, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Sebastian Coates and Jose Enrique may all move on. Combined, they cost more than £50m in transfer fees; they will be lucky to recoup half of that this summer.

That's **7** players, at an average cost of £7.14m. Take out Balotelli at £16m, and it's 6 players at £34, average of £5.67m each. These are the types of players (especially given their ages) that clubs buy all the time in the hope of them coming good or turning into squad players. And at an average cost of under £6m I think they are all fair gambles to take. (Maybe Borini was over valued, doesn't really matter.)

The only player in that list that was meant to be a first team player was José, and he was pretty darn good until his recent injury problems (remember his great interplay and passes with Suarez in the last season or two?).

The main thesis of this article isn't really supported by the examples they have picked. The point they should be making is that *some* of the **young** squad and future players bought over the last 4-5 years haven't worked out. But these examples can be almost directly countered by Sterling, Ibe, Flanagan, Wisdom, Sinclair, Rossister... Maybe even Suso if we'd not sold him (though allowing him to go while bringing in Alberto is a different though related discussion). Countered in that we still have young players in the squad to fulfil FSG's plan of having young players who'll be around for a while (sans Sterling perhaps).

You should know that the train line between Bath and Chippenham is going to be closed between 18 July and 31 August as they're doing some mayor work on a tunnel. That's on your direct train to London. They will put on a replacement bus service, but it will add at least 30 minutes to the journey time I would expect.

For this reason coach might be a better option if you want to go to and from london, look into megabus and national express.

Also, booking travel in advance is usually much cheaper than on the day, prices can vary wildly throughout the day and usually get incrementally more expensive as you get nearer the date of travel, so use a website like [this one](https://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk) to check out prices and look at all options you have. The cheapest way to get to Scotland will probably be to fly (flyby go from Cardiff to Edinburgh, and Easyjet go from bristol to Edinburgh), but you'll need to book that at least a month in advance too. 

Most of the time you will find that you are limited in what you do not because of the logistics of getting there but purely because of how much it costs. The UK has a huge density of stuff to see, so I would just look into the things you're really interested in and go to the best/cheapest to get to of each. If you like castles Chepstow castle is a good option, its one of my favourite castles and its easily reachable from Cardiff, Wales has other better castles, but they'll take a lot longer to get to and will cost much more to travel to.

I know you didn't put any number in the first on, that was my point. In the second one where you were trying to demonstrate how you would show the 10 you actually put the number, yet you wouldn't have done that because you didn't do that with any of the other so it wouldn't make sense. Not that it matters though because even though he is too deep to be a CAM the whole thing is a massive mess. Again, you have RLC as a MR, which is a wide midfielder, not a CM. Secondly, when you play with a 3 man midfield, usually the middle one is the deepest one and not the most advanced otherwise you would end up with an extremely lob-sided midfield. Then I'm not sure if Boga and Allen are supposed to be wingers or CAM's, I know both players are naturally CAM's and they look like CAM's and have the AM tag but 2 CAM's or LAM/RAM with 3 CM's would never work. You either need them to be wingers or you need a 3rd CAM in the middle so that the other two can operate a little wider and don't have to cover as much space.

I don't get how you don't understand what I mean. MR is a wide midfielder, not a CM. You have listed RLC as an MR. RLC is not a wide midfielder. If Ake is right back and his is DR then why would MR not be right mid?  It's really not difficult to comprehend. By your logic Musonda should be ML whilst Christensen and Zouma should be DL and DR. God knows what da Silva and Ake should be. DLL and DRR, maybe?

Personally, I don't see Raheem going to Real and making loads of starts. He may make a lot of appearances off the bench as well, but he's 20 and he's far from the finished product. Yes, he could get another shot at a top club like Morata, but it's a bit different, as Morata left Real to go to Juve after not getting a shot. Raheem will have gotten his shot at Liverpool, done well, agitated to leave for Real where he would, in this scenario, have not gotten a lot of time. That isn't quite as attractive to clubs as buying someone like Morata who was seeking minutes. Raheem has shown, if his comments are true, that minutes aren't that important to him. That's got to be tough for a lot of managers to swallow when he'd be leaving Real seeking time.

This is all very complicated and hypothetical, but my main point is that it's not a great move for him to leave and become a squad player at any club.

Loads of places do have student discounts and things, so make sure you carry your University ID or an NUS card with you everywhere. McDonalds will give you a free McFlurry, Cheeseburger, or small fries if you show them your student ID. Also the public transport is really excellent. It's as extensive as it is in India, but usually much more pleasant to use. I'd recommend getting a month pass or something, as it'll save you a bunch of money. Get an Oyster card when you visit London as well, it'll be cheaper if you use the Tube for more than four/five trips a day.

Food wise, I mentioned McDonalds already, but Just Eat is really good for finding a takeaway near you. As a heads-up, the Indian food here is mostly British-Indian, which won't be what you're used to. There'll probably be a few proper Indian restaurants in Cardiff anyway.

Other than that I'll mainly say that do remember to queue properly, don't be too loud in public, all the usual stuff really.

this is what you dont get. I have put them as close to the middle as I can. I am not saying they are wide midfielders the website is doing that and as I said to make clear they are not as wide as the fullbacks, which you tried saying they were when they are clearly not in line with DaSilva and Ake.

&gt; By your logic Musonda should be ML whilst Christensen and Zouma should be DL and DR.

again what are you talking about? they are both CBs. Do you know what a Centre back is? Not a ""Defensive Left or Defensive Right"". The two defenders in between the fullbacks are the CENTRE backs, Zouma and Christensen

Oscar is level with Cesc? You might want to dispute the youth team but that is nonsense he doesnt play very deep and is not ""often level with Cesc"".

Im sorry and I'm not trying to be rude but can you not do something as basic as comprehending a picture? How can the two players inbetween Da silva and Ake be a ""defensive left"" and a ""defensive right""? As i've said RLC is the midfielder to the right of the central midfielder, im not calling him a wide midfielder, the website is doing that and as is clear from the picture he is central and narrower than the two fullbacks (so is Musonda).

Article 12 does not mention the right to marry.

Should a 12 year old be allowed to marry? Not a human right then is it. Access to water is a human right. 

The republic didn't vote to free women or for foreign workers human rights. These are more pressing issues largely untouched by the foaming at the mouth equality circlejerk. The right to call a civil partnership a marriage is largely a first world problem. 

I accept though that this particular debate has surfaced a large number of contributors wholly opposed to a reasonable questioning of mistaken views. The disconnect between these people and mainstream opinion is quite large. Whether these contributors are on one side of the 'debate' or the other.

&gt;That it would not be acceptable to discriminate against religions either, that if it happened to Ashers themselves they would feel hard done by and therefore the same applies to the gay community. What I am sayng if you could not decipher that riddle is that discrimination should not be allowed as an excuse to turn a customer away as it would leave everyone open to it. 

There's a lot of people that don't want those same 'rights' for people they disagree with and - Paper champion appears to be one of them.

Just because the violence isn't hidden by a secret police doesn't mean its necessarily worse, its just more observable today. Just because the odd Westerner has died is the only reason this violence is advertised.

&gt; Are they, with all that qatari money 

Pretty sure they told their backers to fuck off after they'd captured the oil fields and a few weapons caches. Like I said they burn bridges and aren't good at making friends which is political suicide.

&gt;  Or that they have united half the worlds salafist millitants in two years?

And acted as a gravitational force to draw a ton of them out of our cities and out of hiding into one convenient spot. Nice.  

&gt; Who is going to end them? 

They don't have any allies. They'll implode or lose a border war and then cascade fail into obscurity. The nation states proved you can't be expansive without allies and political agreements.

&gt; But getting a couple of guys with AK's into Milan, or Barcelona.

Which has been possible since forever. I'm saying its less likely now because they have a use for the AKs elsewhere. I think actually creating a state _weakens_ the threat. We have the tools to deal with tinpot dictatorships, we honed those skills for centuries. What troubles us are de-centralised organisations.  

&gt; One in Syria, they are making a major push into the Alawaite homelands on the coast. They are making steady gains. If they take it, not if but when Goverment finally collapses. Then we are talking Israel, Lebanon and Jordan.

Which just hastens their doom. The better they do the sooner their neighbours take the threat more seriously and just exterminate them.

&gt; Serious question, where is the hard limit of what they can do and why?

Nothing more than we already have faced in the past century. Like I said I think going back to the nation states plays into the hands of our security services because it narrows the field.

between someone from Nepal, India, Pakistan or the Philippines.

Yes I am using the 'generalisation' argument as I am just sick to how one group can just spoil it for others regardless of whether I am not affected by it. 

It's obvious which part of this 'Asian' community the issue is an arising problem, it's evident it hasn't been tackled and there seems to general lack of focus into which factor arises from it. 

I have a general understanding the lack of incoherence these types of communities have and a recurrent pattern of responses to these incidents. It follows with a sincere apology with emphasis on

""we do not condone this act of behaviour at all""

null,false,liamdpt,EN,england,null,"OMGGG I'm not saying RLC is MR it was YOU who listed him as an MR. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS. I'M DISAGREEING. 

I'm not saying RLC is MR because he's too far right, I'm saying he is because it says fucking MR above him. Mikel doesn't say MR above him so why would he be a fucking MR you absolute down syndrome. MVG could be a CAM because you know, he's the further forward of the 3 and usually when you have someone sitting in front of 2 CM's, he's a fucking CAM clever clogs.

You never said he's not a striker, you said he's a winger. Saying someone is a winger is indirectly saying they're not a fucking striker you tit. I was wrong when I thought he said Tammy was a striker yes, but that doesn't mean you weren't wrong in saying he was a RW when he's not, he's a striker. Also like I said, him saying he wanted to replace Allen with Tammy doesn't mean he want Tammy to play LW, it just means he'd rather have Boga than Allen. You can still swap Tammy and Boga around.

You're still missing the point anyway... My point from the beginning was that it's hard to understand where players are supposed to be positioned. MvG is in the centre of the 3 midfielders and is also the further one forward but the one in the centre of a 3 man midfield is supposed to be the furthest back which is why it gave off the impression he could be CAM. You could then argue that if he was CAM he would have had AM instead of CM which is why the RLC position was brought into it. Because him being an MR shows the the positions you listed aren't reflective of their actual positions. I never once said I thought RLC was a RW, I said you had him listed as one and by that logic the two CB's would be DL and DR. AGAIN, I STRESS, THAT ISN'T ME SAYING THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY BE DL AND DR.

The place of taxation will be determined by the location of the consumer.

One is to create an absolute taboo against restricting events based on race irrespective of the justifications given, the other is to say that the historical injustices require safe spaces now which require restrictions based on race in favour of the previously excluded minority. Both see an issue and attempt to avoid it, but have entirely opposed interpretations of how to do so, and this is a disagreement between the two.

I personally support the former, but large number of my friends from minorities insist that there is a wider point to the latter which I just don't get.

&gt; ""This dross has left the public woefully ill-informed. Polls show that people on average estimate that 27 per cent of social security payments are lost to fraud, when it is just 0.7 per cent; that 41 per cent goes to unemployed people, when it just three per cent; and that the value of benefits are far higher than they are. Neither is the public aware that most social security spending is, rightly, spent on pensioners who have paid in all their lives; or that the Government’s freeze on benefits mostly hits working people. Large families are passed off as typical, even though just 190 out of the 1.35 million claiming an out-of-work benefits have 10 kids or more.

&gt; A healthy media would challenge myths and prejudices; ours is determined to fan them.
Here is the world that is missing from our television screens. The poverty-wage-paying bosses and rip-off-rent-charging landlords milking our welfare state dry as we subsidise them with tax credits and housing benefit. The low-paid workers struggling along on in-work benefits and falling wages, who make up the bulk of Britain’s poor. The 6.5 million people looking for full-time work, in many cases sending out CV after CV and not even getting a reply. The £16bn worth of benefits unclaimed each year – benefit evasion, if you will – compared to £1.2bn lost to fraud.

&gt; Conveniently, too, TV shows are shifting our glare away from the real villains of modern Britain. Where are the shows about the wealthy tax-dodgers who deprive the Exchequer of £25bn each year, even as millions have to both pay their taxes and be pounded by austerity? What about the bankers who plunged the world into economic catastrophe and continue to thrive as others suffer the consequences?

&gt; This isn’t a conspiracy of politicians and producers cackling around the table together as they devise devious new plans to pummel the poor. A culture of redirecting blame has been encouraged by our political rulers, one that is happily perpetuated by our ideologically-driven newspapers. As unpaid internships and expensive Masters’ qualifications become gateways to TV careers, it is the privileged who are commissioning the shows who are airbrushing out the reality of modern Britain.

&gt; The poison must be stopped. Let’s make Benefits Street the moment that they overreached themselves and start demanding television give a platform to the reality of life for millions which – to the relief of those in power – is ignored and safely hidden from view.""

Despite that though I don't think it has *that* bad a reputation, its just that it was great and things are becoming worse, rather than better and that isn't a great thing for a University. Having moved around a fair bit I think you're right to really think about the reputation of the University, a Russell Group University looks a lot better on a CV particularly if you want to go on to work for NGOs and things, they're not going to know that you did a really good module at Brunel that really opened your eyes to such and such, they're just going to see ""MSc from Kings College London"" and think, you look smart!

* Daniel Sturridge

* Charlie Adam

* Stewart Downing

* Andy Carroll

* Dejan Lovren

* Mario Balotelli

* Rickie Lambert

* Adam Lallana

* Joe Allen

* Jose Enrique

* Paul Konchesky

* Joe Cole

* Simon Mignolet

* Kolo Toure

* Craig Bellamy

* EDIT: Jordan Henderson

Now, excluding Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson, Craig Bellamy and Mignolet (January-April for us this year) and the jury is still out on Lallana, have **any** of those signings proven to be particularly good? Particularly successful? Nope. Not really. In fact I'd argue that Adam, Downing, Carroll and Enrique had an actively negative impact on the club. Premier league proven means absolutely fuck all. 

I'm not against us signing Clyne. He's a good full-back, but the premier league proven thing is doing my fucking head in.

People often budgeted their private pensions on the understanding that they'd get so much from the state.

State pensions were not presented/sold as a benefit , they are something that is paid into, this is why the amount you receive is based off of the number of years you've been paying into it.

Lastly the point about it increasing from 2% to 8% is frankly poor, displaying a lack of basic thinking about how pensions actually work. Here's why:

The National insurance scheme as it is today only really started in 1949.  Very few people who retired in 1950 had a decent amount of qualifying years so the amount they received was small as the years went on, people retired with more and more qualifying years so the amount spent went up. You can see a jump in the 90's as people started retiring having qualified all their working lives. The increase in spending after that slows down and will probably start flatlining eventually.

To sum up, in 1950's lots of people were paying in, few were receiving, in the 1990s, lots paying in, lots receiving.

I don't think it's reasonable to expect the players to figure out how to play with each other and for Rodgers to figure out the right starting 11 and rotations in a short period of time such that we finish in the top four, win one of the domestic cups, and perform well in Europe.

Also worth noting that for terraces it wasn't unusual for fans to be fairly packed in.

Fans piling into an already packed pen wouldn't necessarily have had any reason to suspect anything was wrong when they were being told to head in that direction.

The way crowds are plus the downward slope of the terrace make it quite easy for people pushing forward with not much force at the back to accumulate through the rows of people into a pretty large force at the front that's impossible to push back against.

Depends on location. Around here it's all overhead. Deployment cost is likely to be relatively low - run overhead fibre across the road and into house. Not a massive amount of work, though higher than G.FAST (but G.FAST has its own issues and costs). *This is probably why BT actually already has a lot of FTTP around here (as in 30 seconds from my house) - including to rural farmhouses in the middle of nowhere, with no customers attached to the manifold - a good ROI there.*

There will be places where FTTP would be difficult, but that isn't going to be most of the country, either

&gt; Complete madness to state that can be recovered from an installation fee. 

They already charge £80 for someone to do 10 minutes of work at an FTTC cabinet (with the advent of ""wires only FTTC""). They will charge £80-ish for someone to do 10 minutes of work at a G.FAST DSLAM. They could charge a bit more for FTTP - especially if, as I said, BT plan to make it a ""premium"" service anyway

Consider also the savings from not having to maintain century-old copper (or aluminium)

&gt; To run fibre from the exchange to the DSLAM can be done in a day. Long runs a few days. 

Except that in this case it's more likely to be from the aggregation node, not the exchange (the much vaunted upgrade path that BT uses as an excuse for fobbing off the taxpayer with FTTC).

I notice here that you've deliberately omitted potential issues with ducting and other hassles - I wonder why? Is it to make G.FAST look better?

&gt; One cab can have 300 lines coming off it. Say 200 of them are active and you have 200 fibre runs, 200 access requests, 200 sockets to be fitted and various wayleaves to be organised. That would take months.

Mental gymnastics. Who said BT had to do every house at the same time? Sounds like you're deliberately trying to dream up a least-likely worst case scenario

&gt;  All the bombs in the ground, and DPs up poles. Documentation e-sides and d-sides. Anytime you hit a collapsed duct or a shitty pole or a pole with something spiky near the bottom pushes implementation back. 

You've still got to get fibre to the DP to make G.FAST work (since every metre of copper counts), and you'll be spending a lot of time putting fibre into ducts anyway to get the DSLAMs as close to the home as you can. No time or cost saving there.

For the Albert Dock you have the Holiday Inn, Jury's Inn, Malaison, the Crowne Plaza, Ibis, even the Thistle, or Hotel Indigo is barely a walk. 

Maybe five min walk (ten in heels) you have the Hilton, 30 James Street (what the Titanic Hotel is actually called now I've remembered), Days Inn and (albeit in an away-from-town direction) you have the Radioson blu. Ten Min walk, Dale Street Ibis, Aloft Hotel, Hard Days Night hotel, The Richmond Hotel. All of these hotels are decent, and pretty close. I hate walking around as I'm usually in heels and have tiny legs so consider my timings very conservatively estimated.

Really, the only hotels I would avoid are the feathers, the Z hotel, and the adelphi based on quality, and novotel based on distance. It's close, really, but as stated I'm lazy and it's probably a 15 min walk for me.  

I wouldn't jump at the Hilton though, it's definitely where celebrities stay but it really is boring and corporate. 

Honestly, the Aloft hotel should be reasonable and it is a bit different. Or 30 James Street, it's really tacky and gimmicky but I actually really do like it. HUGE beds.

Yet you counter my steer by then stating that ""we're all too nice to speak the truth"" even worse ""put pressure where it's needed""

If you read my comment, i firstly stated the generalisability of their ethnicity of Asian then merely mentioned that I am aware unlike others of the marginal difference between the Asians which in Britain refers to South Asian. 

From this acknowledgement I then say why I've got an issue of not being specific, well because it's natural for me to be annoyed when one group can ruin it for others even though when the two arent even connected hence the 
'distinguishable difference in terms of ethnicity, religion and culture'

With the main point being that this issue of pedophilia is evidently largely prevalent within this particular ethnic group, which is even enough to refute your comment of how ""we're too nice to speak the truth"" loooool

Worse is that after that I say the reason I've got an issue of generalising the group is because the problem is prevalent within that particular group hasn't been tackled, therefore we should specify what Asian from which communities from what back ground etc...  LOOL yet you say we should put pressure wher it's needed

If you respectively attempted to grasp what my comment steered to that would suffice but you've just skimmed it and worse restated what my point was in a way that brash and unproductive.

The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is only [14 years](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/death_by_dangerous_driving/), and those are both automatic discounts.

The judge does not have the discretion to give him the full 14 years - he must obey the sentencing guidelines, otherwise it'll get thrown out on appeal.

I assume the judge would take his recklessness into account, but I guess the full 14 years would only apply to someone who was so reckless *and also* a repeat offender. 

He would then get a third off if he plead guilty at the first opportunity ([PDF](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reduction_in_Sentence_for_a_Guilty_Plea_-Revised_2007.pdf)).

I would argue it doesn't necessarily take years of being in those countries as I am able to with some accuracy even living in largely white areas. But it was an outcome of socially mixing with alot of those culture that I began to pick up this ability, helping me to analyse who could be from where along with my general interest in biological anthropology. From listening to my Brother and his friends jokingly offending each other about certain features of their origin to acknowledging prevalent features of those certain ethnic groups. You can't be greatly accurate though which I found the explanation to, migration within countries can lead to certain groups being part of that nationality but having little ethnic relation. 

It's funny how, there is a clear difference between these countries and within those countries a far more suttle difference between the groups for example Nepal a quarter population of England has 102 Ethnic groups with different culture, cuisine, language being from one of those groups who are little of 2,000.

You're restricted on certain parts of the pitch and your players aren't all gods who have been blessed with speed and finishing.

It's so predictable too:

1. Give ball to CM/CDM
1. Over the head through ball to winger run and shoot OR pass it to winger
1. Give and go with ST/CAM/CM
1. Give go again (overhead throughball back to winger ofc) OR out strength the defender run and shoot
1. Run and shoot with winger

I literally don't play with Real for this exact reason. It's soooo cheesy. I realllllly can't wait for the day when they learn how broken passing is, especially over head through balls. It should be a lot more inaccurate and a lot less lethal from certain players. A lot of these people who crumble with a patch like that.

we're in a shop, someone does something whatever it be e.g. 
Drop his wallet, slap, steal something be it involve reporting back to the cashier to who is in charge of those matters.

This is for those people who were too lazy to understand the point i was trying to make. 

Which description would be far more efficient in finding the person.
Hypothetically we're in a small shop with dozens of Asian males of different origin, generic looking Indian, light skinned Indian, Bangladeshians (who are darker pigmentation) Phillippines (with largely Portuguese ancestry therefore lighted skinned) Sikhs (if they are Sikhs they obviously have a dastar 'turban' and a beard) Pakistanis (more Aryan features due to their genetic closer to Arabic people) Dark skinned Pakistanis (who are more closely tied to Indians due independence, muslim of course) 

and yes i've purposely involved all South Asians as example in order to avoid counter productive dialogue of ""You know when we're referring to Asians we're referring to South"" even when they don't even contribute to the debate of the use of collective noun Asians.
 
A shop owner finds that the Freddos kept disappearing without many being purchased, a customer sees this and when transacting his purchase tells him about it and the shop keeper wants detail to investigate further
 
Who?

1. ""dunno he wasn't white doe, an Asian guy.
- that doesnt help there's about 100 in the shop now, which 
Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Thai, Phillippines?

2. ""hmmmn, he's probably Indian dunno""
- doesn't help theres about 30 around,
was he Northern (lighter skinned) or southern. Was he a sikh if so mate that would due to beard and the dastar/turban. Was he even Indian could be South Nepalese or Pakistani, British Asian (Accent) more Western clothing?
SPECIFY??!!!

3. ""It was a British Asian because of the identified accent, Southern, Sikh, Pink Dastar, possible of North due to lighter skinned

This ofcourse is for arguments sake I'm not saying we should specify that much but what i'm saying is we should specify enough as the example i have given should be enough to point enough detail to look further and investigate why these incidents are prevalent within those groups. 

Why is Adeeb (yeah i searched google to find the most common  sikh names) taking all of the Freddos, I've already told him off, we should talk to the parents, it's happen with other people wearing Pink turbans, maybe we should talk to the community.

Anyway, less politically: Wales looks small, and is small, but it can take a surprising amount of time to travel around. From Cardiff, the closest National Parks are the Brecon Beacons (north of Cardiff), and then Exmoor, in SW England. You don't need to go to them to get great countryside, though.

If you want to do trips to London or Scotland, then book train tickets in advance to get cheap fares. For Edinburgh, you could also check for cheap flights.

Pros: 

- Gives young players chances.

- Works well with the talent he has

- Not afraid to try different approaches

- Plays players out of position. Emre Can will be a more complete midfielder next season after a year of getting thrown in the fire.

Cons:

- His post match interviews are cringe worthy

- Match day politics, tends to throw a fit and play poor sides when he feels he wants to make a statement to the club.

&gt;It's worth pointing out that upon winning the Champs League in 2005, we had not qualified for the next year's competition.

In UEFA's eyes, we already had. Liverpool weren't the ones who snuck in against the wishes of the competitions governing body. Everton were.

Trying to say that we got in via a backdoor (and therefore, Rafa didn't really earn it) isn't really fair. And that was the main gist of your point in your original post.

If you're entire post was ""we finished 5th"". Well, we don't need you to tell us (we were there), and it didn't preclude us from Champions League qualification.

The whole ""automatically qualify"" thing is itself a misnomer. There is no ""automatic qualification"". Each association has a given number of spots, and it is at their discretion to whom they give them to. There is no actual rule which says ""top 4"" or ""top 3"" gets into this competition.

It used to be UEFA who decided who gets in (league champions, plus defending champs).

Then they loosened it up. X spots to each FA, you tell us who's coming (to allow an FA to exclude a club for domestic malpractice)

Then they tightened it up again. X spots, but you MUST ensure that the defending champs are one of those, if they are from your country.",null,0,null,1432862918,null,0,false,0,croc78b,null,t3_37l4aq,null,t1_croc78b,null,t1_croa72q,null,null,null,1433326357,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

You do realise you are pretty much supporting my argument that the media treats both cases differently so our perception of the problem is different.

 That is literally what I just said. You are arguing about nothing. There *is* in practice, such a thing as automatic qualification. If you meet the criteria to fill one of the slots allocated by your FA, then you have automatically qualified. In 2005 we **had not** qualified for the champions league regardless of what UEFA might have expected because they had given the authority to allocate spaces, and thus determine who qualified, to the FAs. So your assertion that in UEFA's eyes we had already qualified is meaningless, as is your statement about Everton being ""snuck in"". UEFA had given the power over to the FA. The reasons are irrelevant. The FA had the legitimacy to allocate the places as they saw fit, and they did just that. The FA's stance was that allocation of their CL spots should be based on league performance (legitimate) and that if UEFA wanted the CL champions to qualify by default then they needed to deal with that themselves. Liverpool went to UEFA, not to the FA, because the FA's position had been clear from the beginning and UEFA were the only ones capable of changing anything. In other words, we did not qualify automatically because we finished in 5th. UEFA changed the ruling to ensure that reigning champions returned to the competition. **This is what I said in the first place!**

I actually previously thought that we would be signing competition alongside Vert as I feel Fazio makes too many mistakes and Poch doesn't want to put Dier at CB yet (who i think is going to be captain in 6-7 years). However, based on what your stats have shown us, he won't necessarily plug the gap we have in the back. 

I still can't tell why we were so shit in the back this season. It might have been laziness by the older defenders like Vert, Fazio. Or the inexperience by Dier? Maybe the lack of covering by Rose, Davies, or Walker? Either way on paper it doesn't seem that Wimmer will solve this issue single handedly, but nonetheless i **love** that Poch is look at young, exciting talents to put pressure on players who look too relaxed ",null,0,null,1432869899,null,0,false,0,crofu0t,null,t3_37lwyv,null,t1_crofu0t,null,t3_37lwyv,null,null,null,1433328139,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

ok, so please confirm how much service you have. if two years, then...

few CD claims succeed, probably because of the extra hurdle in showing that the employer's conduct was bad enough to be considered a dismissal. 

i'm a bit confused but think that the employer's conduct boils down to a climb-down from ""you will have the secondment when we've found your replacement"" to ""it's no longer in the bag, so you're in limbo"". it arguably counts as resigning conduct but i can see arguments both ways. withdrawing a promise may well do it. on the other hand they haven't said you won't get the secondment and they haven't said that if you aren't confirmed in the secondment this other guy will take your job. they have the option to get rid of him and put you back where you started; for all you know this might be their intention. the not having a role in the department is in your mind at the moment. lets's say that another internal person gets the secondment and they get rid of the external guy, that could be embarrassing to your credibility, but would that be a resigning issue? maybe - it's a broken promise. 

anyway, what would you gain by resigning now? unless you have another job lined up, you end up with an uncertain tribunal claim. is the situation really that intolerable? 

i don't agree that you have  a few days after bad employer conduct to make up your mind. i'd say up to a fortnight and you can always drop  a grievance into the mix to keep your options open, resigning if the outcome goes against you. But i wouldn't be resigning in this situation.

looking into the employer's psychology, perhaps what has happened is that after they promised you the secondment they got advice that this promise arguably constituted indirect discrimination and they ought to have done it by the book and so they went back and did it properly, but as a paper exercise - i.e. they never really intended to give the secondment to anyone other than you. if this is what's happening (and it's happened to me) then you just need to sit tight.

conclusion: i would sit tight, look for another job in case you don't get the secondment and you want to resign in relation to that.",null,0,null,1432877063,null,0,1432877291,0,croizmb,null,t3_37hprw,null,t1_croizmb,null,t1_crmwkz9,null,null,null,1433329626,null,2,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

It's your fault.

&gt;The police could calculate the known distance between a certain combination of cameras on the road, and the time taken, and from that generate an average speed for the journey.

Which they probably did and that's the end of that. Oh, except you're going on...

&gt;Comparing that to other vehicles on the same road wouldn't be in the least bit helpful.

You're the one who wanted to insert other vehicles for some reason, so I don't know why you're bringing that up as if it affects my point at all.

The fact is, if the time taken between two points shows that the speed of a vehicle must have been above the speed limit to cover that distance in that time, then that is all there is to it. 

&gt;If she is above it, then it doesn't in the least bit matter what the other drivers were doing from the point of view 

Again, YOU wanted to start talking about hypothetical lorries. Other vehicles are irrelevant to my point save for the simple fact that each vehicle you add gives you *one more way to calculate the exact same thing*.

&gt;If that is the case ""Knowing"" how quickly some other car on the same journey covered the distance is literally worthless. You cant demonstrate shit from that.

It should go without saying that you absolutely and definitely can demonstrate shit from that, but here we are. If Vehicle A covers the distance between two points in a time that shows its average speed was 70mph, and Vehicle B covers that same distance in less time, then you have incontrovertible proof that Vehicle B broke the speed limit.

We've signed high profile players since then, but not from a high profile club; Glen Johnson came from Portsmouth, Joe Cole arguably fits but was a free transfer so that's not really the same; Suarez came from Ajax and was more famous for his Ghana handball and biting someone than he was as a top European talent; Andy Carroll was the flavour of the (half-)season; Nuri Sahin was on loan; Sturridge was out of favour and hadn't torn it up yet; Sakho was out of favour at PSG; Balotelli and Milan were both living off former glory.

**My point is, we've never been the sort of club to buy a player at his peak from another CL club.** Benzema, Lacazette and Pjanic all fall into that category. So it's ridiculous for people to expect that we're going to suddenly do so now, and it makes it really hard to properly judge the players we *do* sign when you're comparing them to fantasies.

Take Clyne for example - definitely one of the top 3 PL right-backs this season. United fans would probably be happy to have him.

**First, the bad part.** 

Like everywhere, there are racist individuals, but even then it's subtle and not in your face racism. It's the ""you have to work harder to prove yourself racism"" and the ""I'll just throw away your CV because your name sounds funny racism"" and the good old ""immigrants are stealing our jobs and abusing benefits (which, ironically, is usually said by people on benefits)"".

**The good part** 

Now, having said that, I find the general attitude in Edinburgh to be very tolerant and very ""live and let live"". The bad things I mentioned earlier are just a fact of life in even the most tolerant societies.

Even though it's mostly white British, there are all kinds of nationalities from all over the world living here. Then there are the students and the tourists, so people are used to foreigners.

Also, Scottish people in general are friendlier than English people (it may be a stereotype, but it's been my experience as well).

But the article seems to be scaremongering and provides absolutely no context to understand the relative scale of the problem (if any):

&gt; British landlords earned £112bn from capital gains and rental income last year,

How many british landlords is that amount divided between? How much did those landlords invest? What are these landlords average return on investment compared to those who e.g. run a local grocery store?

But buy-to-let landlords are ultimately just investing, and earning money for providing services. Sure, there are some big landlords who go across cities buying up all the properties, not maintaining them and charging a huge amount for them. But there are also a lot of landlords who have saved their life to buy 1 or 2 properties which that keep in immaculate condition charging a reasonable price, to have income to support an early retirement. 

People struggle to live, and to feed themselves, and to get exercise, and to drive, and to do anything in this country because wages aren't in proportion with price, but AFAIK, that's not unique to the property sector. Why aren't we complaining about the people who run shops making lots of money?

I understand that if less people did buy-to-let, then there'd be more houses available to purchase and that would push the price down, but by how much?

That people aren't psychic and all-knowing.

They can convey the message back, but that has to get through over the chants in the crowd and people paying attention to the game, and it has to get through to several thousand people because the only people who can actually help are those right at the back where nothing seems out of the ordinary.

Like, great for you that you've never experienced crushing in large crowds of standing people, but take it from people who have that there's not much anyone actually in the crowd can really do about it unless there's some kind of announcement over a PA system (which is what frequently happens at music festivals where they stop the performance to ask people to move back).

If anything, forcing them to sell is actually helping them achieve the ultimate goal of providing a permanent roof over the heads of the needy.

null,false,mr-strange,null,null,null,"&gt; Can you back up your claim that rents are falling

Sure thing. Here's a page of [statistics from the ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/index-of-private-housing-rental-prices/historical-series/iphrp-article.html#tab-Rental-prices-in-England-and-its-regions--2005-2013-) that documents rent inflation between 2005 and 2013. The stats show an +8.4% rise over those 8 years (+11.0% in London).

Over the same 2005-2013 period, prices in general rose by +20.8%. You can see that from [these CPI figures.](http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Consumer_Price_Index/HistoricalCPI.aspx?reloaded=true)

So in real terms (relative to general inflation), rents fell substantially.

I don't have such good figures for subsequent years, but I think that the ONS recently put rent inflation at +2.1%, which is roughly in line with the annual figures from the 2005-2013 data. Obviously general inflation has now fallen a lot, so today rents are rising a bit - but not yet enough to make up for the years when they were falling.

I'd add that anecdotally, I can tell you that rents in my London street have been roughly static (i.e. falling in real terms) ever since I bought a house there in 1996. So I would not be at all surprised if the pattern of falling real rents goes back a lot further than 2005.

Edit: I was having this discussion with someone last week, and he pointed me to [this ""Homelet"" index](http://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index) which seems to point to sharply rising rents. It's interesting to try and reconcile the Homelet and ONS figures: My best guess is that Homelet is not comparing ""like for like"". As the private rental sector expands, wealthier people are becoming tenants, and so the ""quality"" of lets is rising. More ""luxury"" lets will mean increasing value of new rents - what Homelet measures, without like-for-like rents necessarily rising very much. That's only a guess though.",null,0,null,1432887309,null,0,1432985318,0,crom143,null,t3_37m8df,null,t1_crom143,null,t1_crolssx,null,null,null,1433331059,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

She also voted Tory based solely on the tiny tax reduction. As much as I love her, I can't help feeling a little disgusted for her view on this and the way/reason she voted. 

Then again, she's always watching TV shows like Benefits Street, and when she found out I voted Plaid (Greens weren't running where I'm currently living) she said ""Don't you know the Welsh don't need any more money? I've seen benefits street they're worse than anybody."" Sure, a country with areas that rank near the poorest in the EU, a country with a bunch of coal towns fucked by Thatcher, etc. are surely all just on the take and don't deserve any help. 

It just horrifies me that it's so easy for people to be turned against each other based on tiny tax reductions, scaremongering news outlets, and our 'entertainment' which these days is based on looking at stereotypes of ""doleys,"" which the show dishonestly tries to represent as the average despite the fact that they literally just picked the worst street they could find for the sake of 'entertainment.'

Their agenda is divide and conquer, so long as the proletariat are fighting each other they won't fight back when they get fucked. As long as the middle class are kept comfortable with token tax breaks and biased media they won't object to the disgusting levels of poverty just a few miles away and won't fight back. This governments entire agenda of fucking the many to give to the few is based on keeping the many from fighting back.

Joe Allen is a decent squad player and I don't want to undervalue the importance of helping players transition to how BR wanted to play initially, but still, you can bet your bottom dollar that there were midfielders in Europe for a similar price who do a better job with more of an end product than Allen.

Kolo has done the job he's supposed to do, fair.

I've been following the club since 1999ish.

I don't think it's 100% ethical to force housing associations to sell, or councils to sell, but I think it's more justifiable than forcing a private landlord to sell, simply because the HA's and councils exist primarily to serve the public, so forcing them to sell would be serving the public.

Also, I don't think there's enough evidence to suggest that forcing landlords to sell would solve any problems, and I'm not even 100% convinced that private landlords are even a main contributor to the problem.

With competition for a place coming from the likes of Carroll, Stambouli and any transfers we may make, the ability will flourish out of Mason and we'll see what he is truly capable of.

Pochettino has real belief in him, he signed an extension with Kane until 2020 I believe; and he's a crucial part of Poch's plans next season.

I get #killallmen and it doesn't *particularly* bother me, but I can see why it does bother people. It was a reaction by some people against some men saying that feminists wanted to get rid of men. So it was supposed to be ironic. The problem is, the noise made by the people epousing #killallmen drowns out the arguments of a great deal more men over issues they feel are important to them.

In that sense I find it 'oppressive' not in a direct-power police holding you down way, but like when you're having a discussion and someone keeps speaking over you or immediately attacking components of your argument without letting you fully form the idea.

The analogy therefore wouldn't be making a fake bomb threat, it would be ironic comments designed to undermine other people's ideas. What if some men felt like they were perpetrated as rapists despite not doing anything and so to 'be ironic' they started up #rapeallwomen.

Obviously, from their perspective, it's kinda funny. If people are saying (or assuming) men are rapists, they respond 'yep totally I'm on the way to the shop for lunch and this girl was wearing a dress so obviously had to rape her, made me late back for work! #rapeallwomen'. 

But that is *so* oppressive to every non-idiot who has something to say about their experience of rape because instead of people listening to another human being about their experiences, they get that dog whistle ""Ah! They said rape! #rapeallwomen"" or ""Ah! They said men's rights! #killallmen"" reaction.

Sounds good :) You'll have a great time, providing the weather isn't an arsehole.

There's also been massive rotation across that whole area. Then Poch's high pressing game is also something to think on. When it works and we get the ball back high up the pitch it gives us loads of attacking oppurtunities, when it doesn't we can be left short at the back and look worse than we are, it's just a higher risk/reward style of play.

Looking at all of our centre backs the only one who is near ""World Class"" quality is Vertonghen but he only showed up for an entire season 2 years ago and has been on/off since.

IF Vertonghen and Lloris are on it and we have a settled back four and midfield pairing ahead of them I think we would look a lot more solid than we have done at some times this season but the high pressing game is always going to fail us occasionally.

We do need one of Dier (and now Wimmer) to step up though, Kaboul is seemingly done under Poch and when we signed Vlad I thought he might actually be good for us.

&gt;Islam has more of this bullshit left because its adherents mostly grew up in cultures influenced by war, violence and endless poverty. Not because of Islam being particularly worse in scripture than the other religions.

But this *isn't* true. It's false equivalency.

Christianity has a bunch of horrible things in the old testament, yes, but it doesn't even *compare* to what's in the Quran. Jesus preached peace, tolerance, non-violence, compassion, and goodwill. I don't believe he was divine or anything, but he is certainly a philosopher that I can respect.

Muhammed was a pedophile (raped a 9 year old) warlord, who had people killed for insulting or criticising him and he directed all muslims to wage war on other religions until they were under the rule of Islam. This is historical fact.

As long as people like that rule our country then the marriage equality will never get half a chance, unless it is taken to public referendum, let the people decide and then it will have a fair chance of becoming a human right.

Rights, liberties, freedom, whatever you want to call it these things cannot be subject to law, I don't care what way you put it two men shold have the right to get married, straight people do and I don't care what law you show up, how many words you highlight or what punctuation you use, that is always how I will feel on the matter. The world will be better of when the rights of humans aren't discussed in a political forum and instead just exist. 

You are focusing to much in on the fact or not fact thing, as long as the gorvernment is ran by religious nuts then marriage equality will not stand a fair chance. 

But you don't even care that much about it, you have said so in your comments but still time and time again you put so much effort into this argument, is it all really worth it. If I agree with you then will you be happy? 

Ok it is not a total fact that through the technicality of the law that marriage equality does not exist in this country, does that make it right, does the law being the way it is make everything ok? No it doesn't. Human rights were taken away from many in this country for to long and I am not talking only about gays.

&gt; As I fall in a Conservative constituency, is it worth enquiring about their own stance on it? I imagine they would blindly follow the party...

Definitely! They may agree with it, but they may well not. David Davis doesn't agree with all the things in the Queens Speech: http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-responds-to-the-queens-speech-in-parliament/

Maybe you'll get a good answer, maybe you'll help sway their opinion, maybe you'll see a side to the argument you've not considered before and be swayed a little yourself. Maybe you'll get a useless answer, but I think it's important to try (particularly given how easy it is to do). There's also a cumulative effect if MPs hear lots of concerns from their constituents.

Solanas acted on the rhetoric of others - like Mustafa - she was incited to violence. Mustafa has done this more than once with language calling people 'white trash', etc. I guess everything is ironic now if you get in trouble even if you have a history of making these statements. I guess I should 'ironically' call for the death of all black women or all asian men.

Wearing a shirt given to you by a friend is comparable to calling for the death of an ethnicity and gender? The guy gave an apology similar to those elicited during the show trials of despotic regimes. I imagine he feared for his future employment given what's happened before.

True! But then again, Southampton have a solid academy and would probably use it as an opportunity to blood their new players in, so to speak. If nothing else, Southampton have a solid academy straight into the first team, and Europa competition would make them more attractive to prospective academy/cantera players. 

In addition, with the big clubs getting richer, and the small clubs trying to gain way, Europa might be a better way for smaller clubs (like Southampton, West Ham, Spurs, etc.) to get their teeth in, and might approach it in the way that Sevilla does - or how Diego Simeone did with Atletico Madrid, in that he used the Europa cup run to foster belief and launched his team into the big time. 

For Koeman, if Southampton got into Europa, you'd get the feeling that he'd ignore the domestic cups (he complained about them before) and focus on the PL and Europa league.

null,false,Tatermen,null,null,null,"&gt; There is, I believe, a difference between the examples you have given and certain moral/religious issues

And herein lies the problem - legal and illegal are not the same moral and immoral. What you consider immoral, others may consider moral. What your religion says is right, another says is wrong. Morals and religious opinions are extremely subjective and opinions differ even within the same religions as to how things should be interpreted. This is why we do not just simply use religious texts as the letter of the law - while they may embody the spirit, they're not clearly defined. For example, you may consider blasphemy to be immoral and should therefore be illegal - others do not.

The examples I gave are extreme, yes, but they fit the spirit of Asher's argument. Their claim was that in order to make the cake with the gay marriage slogan on it, that they would have to endorse gay marriage - and that is simply not the case. I can draw a swastika without becoming a neo-nazi. I can hang a Tricolor without being an Irish Republican. I can write ""I don't support gay marriage"" for someone else while supporting gay marriage. I, as a business owner, have no right to suppress your speech just because I personally disagree with it.

Lets take your example of Mr Gill the baker. Here are the facts of the law:

 * Mr Gill is running a shop, and therefore obligated by law to to not discriminate.
 * The discrimination laws say that if you are operating a commercial business it is illegal to refuse to provide goods or services to anyone on the basis of age, disability, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or pregnancy.
 * The European Court of Human Rights has also passed judgement on the matter of political affiliation, stating that it should be considered a protected status.
 * You also cannot discriminate against someone for perceived protected status (eg. if you *think* someone is Muslim and discriminate, it's still discrimination even if they turn out not be Muslim).

Now comes the messy bit:

 * The suggested slogan is in no way obscene, so it is not legal to refuse on that basis.
 * They are not asking Mr Gill to write ""Mr Gill's Bakery supports one man and one woman"", therefore it is not legal for Mr Gill to refuse under Article 10.
 * Mr Gill doesn't have a set of terms and conditions displayed - nothing that says ""we don't make cakes with political slogans"".
 * If Mr Gill refused to make the cake on the basis of his perception of Mr McArthur being straight, or protestant, or catholic, or for being a member of the DUP or other party - it would be discrimination. These are protected classes.

Now, it appears that according to the Asher's judgement that if Mr Gill *had* a clearly displayed set of terms and conditions that stated something like ""We will not make cakes with political slogans"" it would be okay for him to refuse the order as he has a blanket statement banning *all* political messages regardless of affiliation. He can't put up a sign saying ""We will not make cakes for Sinn Fein"" - that's a political affiliation and therefore discrimination.

However in the Asher's case, they had no terms and conditions and on top of that they initially accepted the order. The order was then rejected after several days of discussion amongst the McArthur clan. The judge decided that in this case there was enough evidence that they were fully aware of the plaintiff's sexual orientation and that was the reason for refusing the order, which by the letter of the law equates to discrimination. 

If they had refused to make a cake for a single parent support group, or a political party - the judgement would have likely been the same. The McArthur's moral perception doesn't allow them as a commercial business to ignore the law.

The food was gorgeous, the service was excellent, there were complimentary refills of chips and veg and the only complaint I had was that all the food sounded amazing so it was hard to pick something.

You been cooking much?

&gt; If you won £100Mil on the lottery... what are the first five things you'd buy?

Invest half so I wouldn't have to work again, Then I would do the sensible thing and make sure my family had fully paid off houses and no debts, get a [Supermarine Spitfire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Ray_Flying_Legends_2005-1.jpg), a [Caterham 7 620R](http://uk.caterhamcars.com/cars/seven-620-r), and lastly get either a [Ka6](https://sites.google.com/site/ka6sailplane/) or a [Slingsby Skylark 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_Skylark_4) for the gliding. At least the glider would be somewhat achievable for me without winning. Although the Skylark is a bit of a pain to take apart without a few of you present.

Yeah... see the moronic and incoherent nature of the rest of your post suggests otherwise

&gt;Which they probably did and that's the end of that. Oh, except you're going on...

&gt;You're the one who wanted to insert other vehicles for some reason, so I don't know why you're bringing that up as if it affects my point at all.

Am i? Cos reading back the comment stream here I brought a lorry into the equation as an EXAMPLE of the sort of thing that might hold a speeding driver up and reduce their speed down below the average despite their otherwise constant high speed. Not with any intention to compare the speeds. YOU on the other hand said this: 

&gt;They would just compare her check times to all the other vehicles on the same stretch of road.

As if somehow doing so would be helpful. 

&gt;The fact is, if the time taken between two points shows that the speed of a vehicle must have been above the speed limit to cover that distance in that time, then that is all there is to it. 

Yeeesss, well done sweetie, you've cracked it.

&gt;Again, YOU wanted to start talking about hypothetical lorries. 

Yeah, again i didn't talk about the SPEED of the lorry, i merely highlighted that its very possible to have a legal AVERAGE speed while breaking the speed limit for a LARGE portion of the distance (By being slowed to a speed significantly UNDER the limit for sufficient time).  

You spoke of comparing her speed to other vehicles on the road. Not me. If you struggle to see that i refer to you to your previous posts, and if you still struggle to see it i refer you back to your educational authority to whom you may have recourse for a claim of negligence. 

&gt;Other vehicles are irrelevant to my point

Other vehicles seem to be the sum total of your point

&gt;each vehicle you add gives you one more way to calculate the exact same thing.

In what possible way does it? Car X is traversing 100 miles in 1 hour, ergo she was travelling at an average of 100 miles an hour. Car Y traversed the same distance in 1 hour 30. In what way could you calculate the speed of X using the data of Y? You could add another hundred cars to compare, but it wont give you any more information about car X. It will give you at best aggregate data about what the average speed of traffic is on that section. Which will have absolutely ZERO bearing on car X. 

&gt;It should go without saying that you absolutely and definitely can demonstrate shit from that, but here we are. If Vehicle A covers the distance between two points in a time that shows its average speed was 70mph, and Vehicle B covers that same distance in less time, then you have incontrovertible proof that Vehicle B broke the speed limit. That is Year 7 science.

*sigh* Well id say its Year 7 maths myself, if you're having trouble here you go:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/maths_i/numbers/dst/revision/1/

The part you seem to be missing is that although yes, your calculation will work, you are obtaining that data by the most circuitous and evidentially unsuitable way possible, and for that matter when dealing with the accuracy of the equipment involved the more variables you bring into it the wider your margin of error becomes. And further, the point i was initially making, that the only thing that ANY of this can determine is her AVERAGE speed, and average speed is often not tremendously useful unless you are talking about policing routine low level speeding. 

Thats why average speed cameras are used in sections like roadworks, where general low speeds are required, not on dangerous sections of road where a particular speed enforcement is required at that specific location, where GATSOs are preferred. 

You can travel 200mph through an average speed camera setup if you like, so long as you slow down to 10 for the rest of the section over a long enough distance. 

But ultimately all this seems to come back to the fact that YOU brought other cars into it, then tried to shift the goalposts to suggest that i did, and now you've realised how retarded your point is you're essentially backtracking. But hey, good effort pilgrim, better luck next time

&gt; We have supported the introduction of a General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR). Those who set up abusive schemes should run the risk of being caught by such a rule.

&gt; But it is currently a GAAR without teeth. Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty. There is still no disincentive to try and game the system. That is why Labour will bring in a tough penalty regime for the GAAR, with fines of up to 100 per cent of the value of the tax which was avoided. For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax.

[Callum's List](http://calumslist.org/calums-list/) is a pretty good read about benefit related deaths.

Yes, there seems to be a link most of the time between mental health and benefit related deaths, but you could also argue that the benefits system is pushing people into mental health problems. If you're faced with sanctions or passed fit to work when you don't feel you are, it's going to weigh heavily on the mind to say the least.

When people are dying in one of the worlds most well to do countries with less [than £5 to their name](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/09/david-clapson-benefit-sanctions-death-government-policies), when people are [killing themselves] (http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/suicide-bid-of-woman-who-feared-losing-her-incapacity-benefit-8761182.html) through fear of being sent back to work when they don't feel capable, someone somewhere needs to be called out and have fingers pointed at them. These aren't the actions of people who are simply work shy or cheating the system and are a direct consequence of the benefits system.

At no point have I said that Benteke is a shit long ball striker who can't finish. He has a good thing going at Villa, but it won't translate to Liverpool because it's like trying to give a starving man laxatives.  

I've watched **plenty** of Benteke this season (best mate's a Villa fan and completely agrees with me on this) and although it's a bit of a cheap answer, he gets incredibly fortunate with most of his goals. We played amazing counter attacking football last season because we had the players to make it happen, as Villa do. Our entire team is set up to control possession and dominate a game (even though we're pretty awful at that judging by the last 3 or 4 games of the season). 

He's lethal at Villa, he'd be excellent at United or maybe even Spurs who don't have a manager who has a strict system that he wants to play. His record is decent, but the club is at a cross-roads this summer. Either we keep throwing money at mid-table teams' best players and hoping they can make the transition to a bigger team or we can use the huge, astronomical, fucking ridiculous fee that Villa want for Benteke and chase after strikers who have more to their game than counter attacking and knock-ons and who have already played at a high level. 

I'm not buying any of the complete bullshit about him not being a long ball player though. Since Sherwood took over at Christmas they've played counter-attacking football (actually quite well to Sherwood's credit) but while Lambert was in charge, the first point of play for them was a punt up to Benteke to see what he could make of it. Sherwood has said himself, Benteke is most dangerous taking down diagonal long passes in the 18 yard box. That's not only something Rodgers doesn't implement in his tactics and system but we don't have the players to execute it so **if** we were to sign Benteke he's going to be working completely out of his element and struggle to get the chances he needs. 

Everyone can point to his record at Villa, but you could also point to Balotelli's record at Milan (26 in 43) and Lambert's record at Southampton (106 in 207) but **neither** of them fit in the system we want to play. Tall, strong, static strikers that can't run in behind. I'll grant that Benteke is far better at taking on a man than either of them, but he's not going to get a whole lot better than he is now with us, everything about the transfer points to us taking another huge gamble on 'proven premier league quality'. The simple fact is that across Europe there are alternatives who aren't going to cost us £32million. 

I'd be completely okay with us signing Benteke for £14million or maybe a bit more, but £32million (which, by the way is exactly what we'll end up paying because we're useless at negotiating) is a stupid fee.

""A distinction can be made between the two stages of income distribution:
The allocation of primary income account shows the income of households generated from employment and ownership of assets. The balance of primary income is equal to total primary resources less total primary uses.

• Total primary resources: compensation of employees (income from employment), operating surplus (mainly rental, imputed or otherwise), mixed income from self-employment and property income received from financial assets.

• Total primary uses: property income paid (for example mortgages, rent on land).

The secondary distribution of income account includes government redistribution of income. The balance of secondary income is equal to total secondary resources less total secondary uses.

• Total secondary resources: social benefits (for example state pensions, Jobseekers Allowance, incapacity benefits) and other current transfers received (such as financial gifts, non-life insurance claims).

• Total secondary uses: current taxes on income and wealth, social contributions paid (employee's pension/social security contributions) and other current transfers paid (for example non-life insurance premiums).

And GDHI = Balance of primary account + balance of secondary account.

The UK is one of the most tolerant societies in Europe, however no amount of state education is going to rectify the problem of multiculturalism, nations develop around a shared culture not lines drawn in the sand, the Kurds are a great example of this.  We must accept that multiculturalism has not been successful and the success we see and experienced are due to immigrants adopting enough British culture to be consider British. This is why European immigration is arguably the best kind after anglosphere immigration as they have the least distance to cover when adopting British values.

&gt;Right. But it IS illogical to harp about Rodgers staying. 

No one is harping mate. Most of our fans just feel sorry for Brendan, doesn't mean emotion dictates and we should keep him. Football is cut throat and when there is a willing and able upgrade (Klopp, ancelotti), tough decisions must be made. Regardless of emotion, we all know that. 

&gt;Rodgers have been an average manager at best. Suarez was the reason you almost won the league. 

If I had a dollar for everytime....

&gt; Get rid of the shit players instead of holding onto them and harping about their potential and 'being sad to see them go'. 

Christ alive, if we ditched all our young players that had a dip in form, we'd have been in an even worse position. We wouldn't have Sterling, Coutinho or Henderson. Not to mention there was a period of time where Stevie and Carragher were youngsters and also played poorly. But you're right, we should've ditched them.

Voids (i.e. the property being empty and on the market) are *expensive* for the landlord.  Getting rid of decent tenants is only worthwhile if the landlord is confident he can re-let at a higher rent reasonably easily, which is going to come down to the state of the market in your area.

I feel like if I started a hashtag #killallblackpeople because it is an ironic play on the perception of racial attitudes by white people, then people wouldn't be okay with it. Which isn't necessarily hypocritical if you think that because I'm white my privilege inhibits me somehow.

Each one of the cases would need to be separately investigated if it's not to be dismissed as misinterpretation.

The problem is - and this is somethign I have personal experience of - that the first thing the DWP do when they cut you off is expect you to sponge off friends and family. 

Lost your house? Sofa surf, because everyone has a friend or family member who can put you and your three kids up at a moment's notice. 

Fail an ATOS assessment? Not their problem, you're not claiming ESA anymore, so they don't keep records anymore, so if you off yourself after getting the letter, it's not benefits related, because you weren't claiming when you died.

Miss an appointment because you were too ill and they won't accept notification given by anyone except yourself? Look forward to a couple of months with no income as the appeals process goes through.

This is a war being waged on the most vulnerable and desperate. The Government have made no secret tat their restructuring and toughening of benefits is to cut down on fraud and scroungers, but only 0.7% of claimants are committing fraud, and half of that number is down to *staff* errors while filling in claim forms. For that reason, the remaining 99.3% have to suffer a system which treats them as criminals and dehumanises them. The DWP's default attitude is that if you're not claiming fraudulently, it's just because they haven't caught you yet, and by god do they move every mountain in order to ""catch you"", even if you're doing nothing wrong. 

Silently changed appointments, constantly moving goalposts, policy changes between signing days, biased medical assessments, humiliating questioning and arbitrary sanctioning based on nothing more than the whim of a signing agent. All this is normal practice.

null,false,themanifoldcuriosity,null,null,null,"&gt; Am i? Cos reading back the comment stream here I brought a lorry into the equation as an EXAMPLE of the sort of thing that might hold a speeding driver up and reduce their speed down...

And for the nth time: Why would I give a shit about your hypothetical lorry when the only thing that I need to calculate the speed between two points is the time taken to travel between them. **It doesn't matter how far she was stuck behind a lorry, if she still clocks an average of 100 between two cameras that is all the evidence anyone needs to do her for speeding.**

&gt; As if somehow doing so would be helpful. 

Again: You decided we needed to add vehicles into things. The fact that this is now the third or fourth time I'm having to point this out (as well as my maintaining that the existence of other vehicles is irrelevant) all but proves that you're some kind of special needs case who I don't need to indulge for much longer.

&gt; Yeah, again i didn't talk about the SPEED of the lorry

I don't really give a shit what you thought you were talking about. The fact of the matter is that you *were* talking about the speed of the lorry, since that is the only property of the lorry that can be relevant in this conversation.

&gt; i merely highlighted that its very possible to have a legal AVERAGE speed while breaking the speed limit for a LARGE portion of the distance

You are highlighting something that is utterly irrelevant. It does not matter to me or anyone else whether she was at some point obeying the speed limit - all that matters is what speed we can prove she reached between two points.

&gt; You spoke of comparing her speed to other vehicles on the road. Not me.

I like how you've suddenly decided this should be about ""comparing her speed to other vehicles"" when the quote you are referring to said ""YOU wanted to start talking about hypothetical lorries"". Nothing about comparing speed. 

Fact: You decided you wanted to start talking about lorries getting in the way. You were the first of us to bring in extra vehicles into the argument. The ONLY reason I brought up comparing the speeds of the two vehicles was as a demonstration of ONE ADDITIONAL method of calculating speed between two points. And in the same post, I made clear by my words that this would be unnecessary.

So why should I be bothered about you pointing this out like it doesn't just prove my correctness?

&gt; Other vehicles seem to be the sum total of your point

[This is the sum total of my point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37ftme/car_stuck_in_tree_after_driver_loses_control_when/crmd56d) Please quote the part where I mention any other vehicles.

&gt; In what possible way does it? Car X is traversing 100 miles in 1 hour, ergo she was travelling at an average of 100 miles an hour. Car Y traversed the same distance in 1 hour 30. In what way could you calculate the speed of X using the data of Y?

And this just demonstrates beyond all doubt that you are thick as pig shit because not only have already explained how you could do this multiple times, but it's also something that any 12 year old could do with ease.

What data do with have from Y? The distance: 100 miles. The time: 90 minutes. From this, we get the speed: 66 miles per hour. From this, it is literally child's play to state that if X travels the same distance (100 miles) in 30 fewer minutes (i.e. one hour) it is travelling (drum roll) ONE HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR. But then, what this also proves is **exactly what I said in my first response to you: You do not need any other vehicle on the road to be able to calculate the speed of vehicle X, all a lorry/vehicle Y does is give you more data with which to confirm your conclusion.** To which I might now add ""you fucking imbecile"".

&gt; Well id say its Year 7 maths myself

[Which is just one more way in which you're making a muppet of yourself.](http://www.theschoolrun.com/year-7-science)

&gt; The part you seem to be missing is that although yes, your calculation will work

Why am I giving a shit about anything else you say if my calculation works?

&gt; you are obtaining that data by the most circuitous and evidentially unsuitable way possible

Please explain how noting the time taken to pass two points - where the two points are fucking cameras - is circuitous or ""evidentially unsuitable"" (whatever the fuck that even means).

&gt; when dealing with the accuracy of the equipment

Ah, suddenly you care about accuracy of equipment for some reason. Just as well then that my equipment is ""cameras"", whose accuracy for these purposes is somewhere in the region of 100%.

&gt; involved the more variables you bring into it the wider your margin of error becomes.

Just as well then that I didn't introduce any variables. And even more just as well that I've explained multiple times how the variables you thought you were introducing affect nothing.


&gt; And further, the point i was initially making, that the only thing that ANY of this can determine is her AVERAGE speed

Why do you think that is an intelligent point to make given that MY initial point was in response to a query about how police would ESTIMATE her speed before the accident - to which the most obvious starting point is ""use the last two of the hundreds of cameras monitoring the highways to check her average speed on the area of the motorway leading to the accident""?

Tldr: You started out just being a bit dim, but now you've graduated to being a belligerent fuckface... who is still wrong about everything you've said (saving the parts where you've inadvertently just parroted things I already pointed out).

Well done.

We are trying, however as we are witnessing it is not easy. IMO we have stupidly allowed gettos to form which has allowed Islamic communities to stay segregated from British culture, why adapt if you culture has followed you? In the long run I think adoption of British values and an agnostic approach to religion will prevail, however to do so we must both limit islamic immigration and most importantly ensure gettos do not form. In the medium term, I don't see a dignified solution, we either allow communities to  stay strong and impose these checks or we break up the communities.

&gt;So-called “Type 1 offenders” target young people “on the basis of their vulnerability, rather than as a result of a specific preferential sexual interest in children”.

&gt;Ceop received intelligence from 31 out of 43 police forces on groups like this who were known or suspected to have abused vulnerable children in 2012.

Of 'Type 1' offenders:

&gt;Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, 75 per cent were categorised as Asian, 17 per cent white, and the remaining 8 per cent black (5 per cent) or Arab (3 per cent).

----

&gt;The 27 court cases that we found led to the convictions of 92 men. Some 79 (87 per cent) were reported as being of South Asian Muslim origin

----

&gt;Ceop identified 144 victims of the Type 1 groups. Again, the data was incomplete. Gender was mentioned in 118 cases. All were female. Some 97 per cent of victims were white.

----

&gt;Ceop data about the ethnicity of offenders and suspects identified by those 31 police forces in 2012 is incomplete.

&gt;The unit says: “All ethnicities were represented in the sample. However, a disproportionate number of offenders were reported as Asian.”",null,0,null,1432898749,null,0,1432898954,0,crootgw,null,t3_37mre5,null,t1_crootgw,null,t1_crojwsw,null,null,null,1433332443,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

That is an issue. This issue needs to be rectified. Finding potentially vulnerable children who could later go on to be jihadists seems like a pretty fucking good way of doing that.

The failure to have a proper debate about defence and foreign policy was the biggest casualty in the General Election. Unfortunately people and politicians just aren't interested in those kind of issues. For example, one of the big criticisms of the arms industry is that it sells to dodgy regimes and human rights abusers. I agree with that but then no one seems to make the logical link with the collapse in demand for arms in the West. BAE etc. don't have a UK market to sell to. I'm not sure they enjoy selling to Saudi Arabia and all the corruption scandals that come with that but they have no choice if they are to retain their expertise and capabilities. 

Defence policy in the UK is an absolute joke. The Ministry of Defence has become a politically easy target for cuts. Cameron's inability to commit to 2% AFTER calling out other countries at the NATO summit in Wales is unbelievable. We have reached a point where we will have 80,000 regular troops. At one point in the late1940s we had 80,000 troops stationed in the Suez Canal region ALONE. Of course, different times and different contexts and we had National Service back then but it should illustrate the scale of how far we have downscaled. It is about time this country had an open debate about how we see our armed forces. We should stop piggybacking off US defence budgets (they contribute to 70% of NATO funding and is unfair on the US taxpayer) and decide want we want our armed forces to do.

EDIT: Here's what I'm talking about;  

&gt;If, at the start of the tax year, 2 or more companies are connected with each other and those
companies would otherwise each be entitled to the Employment Allowance, only one of those
companies can qualify for the Employment Allowance for that tax year.

It really is a very beautiful place, both architecture and nature wise. Meadows, Arthur's Seat, Prince's Street, National Museum, Calton Hill, MED SCHOOL, and many more

Housing prices are reasonable

Decent and averagely-priced nightlife, with plenty of options

If Edinburgh isn't pretty enough for you, it's not too expensive to travel around Scotland: Highlands, Pentlands, Glasgow and St. Andrews are all places you'll probably end up visiting

Multiple choice exams are a definite win! Not sure how other med schools operate though

Edinburgh Med School is prestigious: you'll often get a 'wow' when telling other students your course/uni

**Cons:**

Weather, wind and cold are abundant

Some people may consider Edinburgh students to be a little stuck up? But don't worry, you'll meet a ton of diverse people :)

BIG ONE: I've felt the organisation and management of Edinburgh Med School to be poor this year, and other students in my year also feel this way. I mean, it's not disastrously bad but it's below satisfaction.

1. If life were a game you are living it on easy mode. 

2. No minority is saying that. 

I repeat. Socially and Legally, white people have had inordinate amounts of benefits handed to them. Those benefits legally have been removed. 

However those social benefits are still around. They are often invisible to white people. Let's take an example. When I lived in the Czech Republic the only place near me where I could get food late at night was a rather seedy bar. A couple of times a bunch of neo-nazi would get together and chant racist things. 

White friends LOVED that place. They could not understand why I did not. Why? The idiots chanting things are harmless to them. They don't realise that I cannot go there by myself unless I wish to have very expensive dental work done.

None of my friends have ever needed to leave a plane because the person next to them didn't want to fly with a Muslim (Joke's on them? I am an ex-Hindu atheist). 

None of my friends have ever had to explain every single item in his bags. 

None of my friends have had to open up electronics. 

What you do not get are all these minor things that you do not have to face. And some of these things are pretty major. 

Let's just look at how Black kids are treated. Police are more likely to be violent towards them even if they are doing the same thing as a white kid. Why? Everyone knows criminals tend to be black... that stupid piece of minor racism has lead to tragedy after tragedy. 

The simplest example of what everyone else has to deal with is this...

Ha!  Originally the person requested for a repeat of a report that was released which included data going up to 2011.

The original response from the DWP was:

&gt; “Thank you for your email and apologies for the delay in responding.

&gt; “The publication you refer to was released on Department’s website as an ad-hoc statistical analysis publication. As such there is no intention of releasing an updated version of these statistics.” 

&gt; That letter stated: “I am sorry that the information you require is not readily available. As this would take a considerable length of time to pull together I am unable, at this stage, to tell you when the next report will be available.”

So the guy asked for the data that went into the report instead as an FOI request.

They rejected it claiming that it was 'vexatious' and just a campaign against the DWP:

&gt; seeking to bolster his statutory rights with the persuasive power that comes from communal action, that the appellant converted an unexceptional request, on a matter causing justifiable public concern, into one that constituted misuse of the freedom of information regime and could therefore properly be refused on the basis that it was vexatious for the purpose of FOIA section 14.

When he appealed, the DWP relented and said that they'd produce the data at some unspecified point in the future.  The ICO have said that isn't good enough and they need to produce it now.

They're not going to say they won't produce it because it will be taken out of context, because as you say, that will be rejected.  What they do know is that the last report they produced gave them a lot of bad press, so there is a reasonable assumption to say this is the reason they don't want to do it again.",null,0,null,1432900028,null,0,false,0,crop7o4,null,t3_37p9ot,null,t1_crop7o4,null,t1_croojw4,null,null,null,1433332629,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Couldn't agree more, but there's quite a big difference between what you're saying there and what /u/bottomlines said. I think Goldsmiths probably should have sacked this person and I think the decision they've made is poor, but I'm not really sure that justifies the statement ""now my only impression is that it is probably shit"", which they're only saying because of their lack of awareness about the university.

If I said ""The University of Oxford is probably shit"" because of some of the extremely poor environmental decisions by the leadership board and because of the claims of censorship by the Union Society, I'd (rightly) be called an idiot. The only big difference between these examples are that Oxford is very well known whereas Goldsmiths isn't.

Obviously a private landlord expects to earn some amount of profit, this is true of any private enterprise. No different than owning a shop and selling your products for more than you brought them for, or any other business. What are you actually saying here? That it should be illegal to rent property for profit? Why not just go the whole hog and ban all private enterprise?!

&gt;They are pushing up demand while not effecting supply this drives up prices.
Higher prices mean higher rent.

No, this is obviously wrong because a house can't be available for both rent and purchase simultaneously. Every time a BTL landlord buys a property in an area, there is 1 less property available for owner occupation, but also 1 more available for rent. The laws of supply and demand you reference will tell you that if you increase supply, you lower demand and thus price. So for every additional property available to rent in a given area, the price to rent in that area will fall.

But that is alright for IDS and his voters, they're all shirkers anyway.

My prediction? most people will just shrug their shoulders and say DNGAF. present company excluded of course.

edit.*  just found this link, apparently The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has admitted that 10 of the 49 benefit claimants whose deaths were subject to secret reviews had had their payments sanctioned.

*The figures have caused alarm, as they suggest that claimants who have been sanctioned are far more likely to suffer a death linked to their benefit claim than those who have not been sanctioned*.

*This week, a press release put out by the new employment minister, Priti Patel, stated that sanctions were only used “as a last resort in a small percentage of cases”, with less than six per cent of JSA claimants and one per cent of employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants being sanctioned*.

**But this compares with more than *20 per cent of benefit-related deaths* reviewed internally by DWP that involve someone who had been sanctioned**.

There is not much room for spin with this, sanctioning or shall we say what it is really called? (sanctioning sounds too clinical) is the Tory party and IDS intentionally impoverishing and starving vulnerable people to force them into work. Even though the Government does not have a policy of full employment.
People have been driven to suicide and IDS wants to ignore it, Cameron does not even mention it. Most Tory voters must think its just getting them benefits streets shirkers back to work, callous wankers.

At the time of QE the banks where buying securities like gilt rather than investing individuals and businesses. Gilts are packages of goverment debt which is paid over time they have a rate of return set at there creation. By buying all the security with the higher rate of return the banks would both gained a return on it investment and be unable to reinvest in high rate of return security (due to Bank of England owning them. the debts where not cancelled just brought from one private company to another)  


 Consider the return on gilt market is incredibly low the moment, banks are now lending to businesses and individuals again. I dont see why the central bank will do more QE as repetitive QE could shake faith in the currency something BOE dont want to see.  

On a side note the annuity's market which must use gilts to give pensioners there return has been devastated by this move. With no high return gilts to buy the annuity return is terrible which is causing older people to work longer because they are unhappy with the annuity's they are being offered. This having a massive effect on the labour market as these people seek work far more effect than migrant labour has.  

 Exports have never been concern of our goverment since thatcher decided that we where nation of services. Industry in uk has been suffering the effects of finical currency trading for a long time and this tory goverment has shown no interest in changing that.

Players like him will go in stretches where they score and everyone will freak out but then he will go months without contributing anything. Chances created looks good on paper but not a lot of those were clear cut. Eriksen is a shell of what we saw last season. He's got into the habit of playing very simple passes. Working it side to side until the right run or pass opens up. If this sub really wants attacking football like we say, wouldn't we want a guy like Carroll who makes decisions quickly and is always playing different passes to change things up and try and push Eriksen. 

Regardless of what happens neither of our opinions matter. If he's good enough like I'll say he will stick around otherwise I hope he kills it wherever his career takes him.

I was amazed at how much fun I had watching this last World Cup. Not only the U.S. team games, but as many games as I could watch were all so exciting to me. I decided to start following the sport. I decided that many of the world's best play in Europe so I'd follow the EPL (since they speak English and I can follow more easily than other Euro leagues). Since my father grew up in Boston and I'm a Red Sox fan, the Fenway connection to Liverpool made them a natural team for me to follow. I watched about half of their games this year. Thank you to this subreddit for allowing me to keep up with the team, highlights, the rumors, the humor, all of it. 

I watched the 30 for 30 documentary on the Hillsborough tragedy this past weekend. It was quite moving, made me feel sad, then frustrated and angry at what those families have been put through. It made me feel even more... satisfied... in the team and fanbase that I have chosen to be a part of.

Anyway, to add a discussion point: It seems to me, at least, that the team is STACKED with young players that performed mediocre this past year but with moments of brilliance, but given another year of experience and HOPEFULLY some consistency of playing together (or at least in the same formation and positions) they could be very good next year. I see this subreddit has very strong and often divided opinions of potential transfers, but ultimately, isn't the team set up pretty well with a core of good young players? As a lifelong baseball fan, when you have a core of good young players, you wait for them to develop to see what holes you have after about 2 years before you go sign 1 or 2 major 'free agents' to put you over the top.

So as much as we might try to dismiss Greece as a bad example, I think it's instructive to see what can happen when you transfer so much power away from your own country/economy that you can no longer really fix it. If we'd been in the euro could we have assumed that the rest of the EU would have agreed to back our banks? What price would we have had to have paid? I really can't imagine that as being a tolerable situation for the British people.

At some point the eurozone will need a new round of integration, I cannot see us ever agreeing to be a part of that, so irrespective of a yes (to remain) we will be on the very outskirts of the EU regardless, we have no appetite for the level of integration that's coming inside the EU and I wonder therefore whether we'd not be better off out of it altogether?

Like Dudley. A well known ""No go area for non-Muslims"".

AH FUCK BALLS! The gigantic Hindu Temple in the UK is here and so is a Sikh Gurudwara. When people say it's a no go area what people mean is ""Don't go there it's full of darkies, they do weird things"". 

Want to know something funny? Anyone can go to a Hindu Temple or a Sikh Gurudwara. The only rules are the rules of the temple. No meat. Leave your shoes outside. Don't be intoxicated. And respect people's beliefs. Oh and if you are in a Sikh Temple you are expected to contribute labour to the upkeep of it. Even Muslims go... 

This exists in Dudley and whatever beef you think you have with Islam is nothing compared to the animosity Islam and Hinduism and Sikhism have. But even they can co-exist.

Edinburgh is a modestly sized city and you're fine on foot or using the good bus service. There is a large student population, particularly in the south side where you'll probably be based (unless always at the Royal Infirmary, which is a little bit further south). There are a lot of really good pubs, maybe not so much for nightclubs. It's very much a ""liveable"" city, and really rather nice.

The death stats around these drugs are also iffy. The stats refer to 'novel psychoactives' which is a more sciency name, but doesn't mean exactly the same thing. Lots of illegal drugs come under this banner too, it's a very loosely defined term. The highest estimates put the number of legal highs deaths at about 100 annually, and the lowest somewhere less than 30. 

There are lots of drugs that can be used with a high degree of safety, unfortunately most of them are already illegal leaving them in the hands of criminal markets, unregulated and often contaminated. The one good thing that could be said about the legal high market was that there was little incentive to cut the products - problem being there's no research on the harm profile of them, so consumers have no idea how to dose etc. A blanket ban on all psychoactive substances just places us back in the old situation of the whole market being underground, rather than just some of it.

I actually think the reason why we're going for Benteke is because he's premier league proven and the only one available.

If he brings in Vietto/Aubameyang, and they do not adapt to the Premier League (specifically the Intensity of the league), then Rodgers is in massive trouble. By bringing in Benteke, someone who is used to the league and scores a lot of goals, he's safe in that regard.

I'm not sure why it is necessary to bracket people. Looking at the relationship between sex and power is useful but it does miss the bigger picture. We definitely do get social advantages because of our skin colour and sex/gender. I also get a lot of social disadvantages being from a working class background. I'm not really interested in totalling up which is worse. These are broad social constructs and models and applying them on a personal level can be divisive if not incorrect - and I just think we should be wary of that.

&gt;which exists because those in power are predominantly white and male

And the scariest thing here is how difficult it is to challenge that. Given that a great deal of power and wealth (inextricably linked IMO) lies in the hands of a select group of white men how do we deal with that?

And the threats always *always* involve property, not tax. 

I mentioned in the article above that the nationalisation of businesses provoked a very very powerful backlash that ultimately propelled Thatcher in government. That was because confiscation of property was involved  - people didn't know where it would end. Would small businesses be targeted, would people's savings be confiscated, what about their houses?

To Blair's credit he understood that, hence the removal of Clause 4. And was able to raise NI to ""pay for the NHS"". So it's not tax that's the issue, but property rights. 

In the last election, I have a vivid memory of someone talking about confiscating ""empty houses"". I vote Labour but a chill went down my spine. Thoughts started to race. What if my parents were ill and I had to shut up my house for a bit to go and look after them, would my house be confiscated by ""Red Ed"".

I don't even know if it was an official policy or just some idiotic think tank thinking they were being clever putting ideas out there. 

Don't do that! It scares the heebie jeebies out of people and they can reject your entire package because of it. Even if it's not official policy and some foolish pressure group is proposing it. The English are very possessive about their things. Charles I was executed because he was threatening landowner interests (yes, yes, there was that divine right stuff, but that was an excuse to get rid of him).

The mansion tax also went down badly - mainly because people could imagine a situation where their property value rose so much they were caught up in it. It was no good saying ""the majority of the country wouldn't be affected"". People could imagine some period *in the future* where they would be affected. And that was enough to put them off.

Just don't say or do anything connected to property. Leave it alone and focus on the many more important things you could do and offer. It seems ridiculous that something so small could make people throw out an entire package, but that's what happens, over and over and over again. 

Regarding tax, taxation of income of any sort is seen as ""fair"". So income tax, national insurance, corporation tax - these are all taxes on revenue generated and seen as fair game. Getting non-doms to pay their income tax was seen as an extremely good idea. Taxation on property is seen as unfair. You've bought it out of your after tax income. Is it your fault that the property price has increased (especially as you have no intention of selling and intend to stay put till the day you die)?

Or via compulsory taxation on all of us?

As are church groups, sporting organisations, the armed forces, and the BBC. If you don't want your taxes to fund them, take it up with your MP, but you are not legally obliged to join any of them.

&gt; If I live in area where the only local schools are religiously controlled is it a voluntary decision to send my kids there?

You chose to live there, knowing what schools were available. That's voluntary. Same thing if you live near a shit hospital where you wouldn't want to be treated - your choices are to either go without, go private, or move.

&gt; I note you yourself are using the phrase 'segregated'. That's kinda at the heart of the apartheid concept.

&gt;EDIT: And you'll notice the webster's dictionary definition for apartheid does not include the need for the segregation system to be imposed in a legal framework exactly akin to South Africa. Its a more general descriptive term than that: ""a system of segregation"". That's exactly what we have.

Firstly, words are defined according to usage, not according to what the (no doubt fine) lexicographers at Websters say. You and I clearly make different inferences from the word 'segregated'. I actually don't think it's an entirely accurate term as it implies artificial pigeonholing rather than voluntary divergence, but as the counterpart to 'integrated' education it is at least clear about what we're discussing. And my aim is to be understood, not to get into semantics.

Religiously-segregated (""segregated"", etc) schools are extremely common everywhere else in the English-speaking world. The majority of schools in GB and the Republic have a religious ethos, and the religious sector also thrives in the US. Parents don't usually enrol their kids there out of zealotry, they do so because the local CoE school or the Catholic school gets better results than the secular state school, or has better pastoral care, or an easier commute - and vice versa. No accusations of apartheid or social engineering, no scaremongering about the rise of sectarianism.

Furthermore, for me ""apartheid"" has always carried very strong connotations of institutionalised racism and inequality. That doesn't apply within religious-ethos NI schooling. It is illegal in this country to refuse a child entry to a school based solely on their faith background. As a teenager at Catholic school there were a handful of kids from Protestant, Hindu and Muslim background; it was never, ever an issue or a point of difference/contention, it was just another fact about that person.

I'm certain there are kids who come out of religious schools sectarian. I'm equally certain, from experience, that there are kids who come out of integrated schools sectarian. Dickheads will be dickheads. I am all for a pluralist society and I'm glad that the NI I live in as an adult is so ""mixed"" compared to the NI where I grew up.

It's essentially worked out by their performances and amount of interest globally there is in them, including bids made in the past. 

For example Ings is looking to cost about 7 mil. That's for a player who's played 1 season in the premier league, and not hugely set the world a blaze.

Sterling is the current European golden boy, and has performed at the top level since he was 17. I'd guess if he continues to improve over these next two years we could get over 20 million for him. It would definitely be a record.

The upside is, if Sterling doesn't improve then interest in him won't be as high. Say he gets stroppy and plays like he has done for the last 5 months, that would only harm his potential moves.

Works across the majority of banks. 

Another cool thing is the ability to withdraw money from a Natwest ATM using the mobile app. No need for a card. 

Also, the app verifies using your finger print if you have an iPhone with that capability. 

I think Natwest are great. I switched to Halifax and after £90 of fees in the first 3 months for seemingly no reason (no doubt there was a reason, but a reason natwest don't have) I switched back. Currently, with a £2,000 overdraft at natwest I pay ~£30 in fees per year. 

Then another £12 for their gold account, which I highly recommend. Green Flag breakdown, travel insurance (including winter sports) and the best phone insurance I've ever used. £50 excess, and there was a new phone in my hand &lt;24 hours after I called them up. Phenomenal.

Yes, it's even worse from people of those ethnic/religious groups
but weren't these crimes committed with the acknowledgement of the perpetrators community leaders.
Weren't these activities left unreported by individuals from these communities with the fear of backlash, yes. Is it unfair to subject them to harsh criticism for those people, one could argue one way or the other with a yes or no but you can't deny the truth that the COMMUNITY FAILED. 

The Nepalese community i live within makes sure that children are taught values any other parent in the world has in an addition installing discipline. It's clear from the recurrent theme of the perpetrators ethnicity and religion, there's no denying that there is some cultural failure not within that ethnicity of that group or religion but that community. 

If a member of my family has done something wrong which from my natural intuition or the values i have been taught, I will make sure to condemn it and resolve it through constructive dialogue. 
They represent me, I am involved with them because they're part of my family.
Same principle should go to these community.

You purport that Christians are oppressed in the UK, my Country, not yours (I'll come back to this). They are not. I imagine if you've heard that anywhere it's from somewhere like Alex Jones. He doesn't like British people because he still thinks it's 1880 plus he's an inward-looking, reactionary, racist piece of shit. He sells reactions because people are stupid. If it's not him precisely, it's from somewhere else with the same pretend axe to grind. However, back on track, if there are fundamentalist Christians, people who define their beliefs as absolute, an extremist ideology that's very harmful to others and against The Bibles teachings, I hope they are being oppressed as you say because they aren't welcome in an open, accepting and moderate society (That's what Jesus teaches btw). They are defiantly against it, so fuck 'em. It's an empty threat against an empty claim.

Now to your other point. 

1) I'm English and I can tell you that you're using the language incorrectly. Sentences begin with capital letters. So do nouns. ""Unsurprising"" and ""Brit"" is what you were looking for. There's more but I'll let you find them. 

2) I think that you're trying to imply that British people like being spanked by their Mothers. I'm not sure how you were so unsurprised as despite being British myself, I've never heard of that stereotype.

3) If that was remotely offensive, I would say that's pretty fucking racist. It's mostly ignorant because (coming back to what I said) you don't live here. You've probably never been and you certainly don't have a fucking clue what you're on about pal. You have ABSOLUTELY no point of reference to even possess an opinion. You need to read The Bible some more. You won't get into Heaven being a prick like that.

4) Those odd subs aren't nearly as fucking strange as going to /r/Subredditdrama to find discussions to troll. Now I don't know if you've done any reading about trolling, but typically, people that do it are pariahs, social outcasts with little to no social status whatsoever. Losers, wierdos, lonely freaks. They troll because on the internet they can feign having power when in the real world they have zero power and zero self-worth. They do it because they hate themselves.

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"I agree we'd need to adapt to get the best out of him, but I'm not as opposed to this as a lot of people. I have my doubts, but I think he's a very good player. The doubts are obviously if Rodgers can get the best out of him, and if he'll remain injury free. 

His strengths are great;

 - Huge imposing force (something we sorely lack in the final third. ) We have no players that really challenge defenders, and Benteke would really give teams who sit back issues, something we haven't been able to counter well under Rodgers)

 - He's quick. Not insanely quick, but he can burn past defenders easily enough, and coupled with his strength it makes him stupidly difficult to defend against. 

 - He can finish very well, with both feet and his head. We all know how much we've missed someone that can do this, this season. 

 - He presses well and makes very intelligent runs. He has the instincts of a killer forward. He will find that gap in the defense to run into. He will drop into some space to pick up the ball for a shot, he will pop at the back post when that cross is whipped in. 

I'm for it. We need a good striker, and he's up there with the best we could realistically go for.

Thinking further ahead, if we stick with Rodgers for this season, but it doesn't go well again, he will be out. Having someone like Benteke available for the next manager is fine by me. 

So in my mind, there are more potential pro's in my mind for this than negatives. I'm not too fussed about the transfer fee unless it is absurd. If it gives us a striker who will put the ball in the net, that's worth it.

Why? Because each time we get involved we end up making the situation worse in the long term. Good or bad intentions aside. 

For example the drone policy the CIA had for several years and the 2nd+3rd strike policy (where the drone would loiter and would bomb anybody who went to help the people originally bombed) or bombing funerals because only terrorists would attend funerals of terrorists right?

So you had nothing to do with terrorism yet you get bombed... do you think oh that's all right then and continue with your life as if nothing happened or would you be angry and join the fight? So you kill one legitimate target (who may or may not be a terrorist) and end up killing 10 more innocent people. Those 10 people have families and they'd be rightly pissed off.

This is what happened in Vietnam. The bombing, the troops kept on killing innocent people unrelated to the conflict see the Winter soldier investigation (1971) testimonies where whole villages were declared to be Vietcong, all the girls were raped then the whole town was murdered. This outraged local people and encouraged MORE people to take up arms. 

This is why the old logic of the kill count did not work. For every ONE legitimate kill there were dozens of non legitimate kills and the numbers who may not support the main cause of the Vietcong/ISIS whatever but see it as a way of getting revenge. Think about the outrage 9/11 or the London bombings caused? Think of the outrage if this happened on a daily basis.

This is why I don't have much faith in false flag theories. Because normal policy creates a never ending stream of people who are against you.

null,false,MrStilton,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"Obviously it depends on what sort of banking you’re doing.

If you’re just looking for a current account with a good interest rate then the one with the highest (at the moment) is the [Santander 123](http://www.santander.co.uk/uk/current-accounts/123-current-account) which offers 3% interest on balances up to £20000 (although it also requires you to pay a monthly fee of £2, pay in at least £500 a month and set up direct debits so it’s obviously not going to be for everyone).

If you’re a student then go for the equivalent [student version of the 123 account](http://www.santander.co.uk/uk/current-accounts/student-graduate-current-accounts/123-student-current-account) which has different terms (and only offers 3% interest on balances up to £2000).

The downside to Santander is that they know they’re offering the best interest rates and so their customer service is… well, *pretty shitty*.

If you’re looking for a savings account then I’d recommend the [Regular Saver Account from First Direct](http://www2.firstdirect.com/1/2/savings/regular-savings-account?WT.ac=FSDT_CTA_SAV_REG1003) which offers interest rates of 6% APR. Although, to get this you do have to jump through a few hoops (e.g. you’re required to set up a [First Direct First Account](http://www1.firstdirect.com/1/2/banking/current-account)).

Also, bear in mind that some banks will offer you money for switching to them (e.g. First Direct and the [Clydesdale Bank](http://www.cbonline.co.uk/personal/current-accounts/)).
