null,false,CaptainHayashi,,Labour Member | Corbyn/Eagle,null,"&gt; Lots of the Corbynites are students, people who will get graduate jobs and thrive even if we have perma-Tory govt.

Is this implying that Corbyn supporters only vote for Jeremy because they don't feel as if it'll really matter if the Tories get in for five years?

I can't speak for all of us, but just because I'm a Corbynite student doesn't mean I feel as if I'm going to get the easy life when I fall off the end of education (graduate employment was still pretty terrible last time I checked, and I'm not the most employable person), nor does it mean I'm utterly blind to how this country and its most disadvantaged people (especially the disabled) are being screwed over by the Tories.  Things like wage slumps, the bedroom tax, private company influence in PIP assessment, unfair use of benefit sanctions, and the starvation of council resources across the country make my blood boil, and I know people who have been directly affected by some of these.

This subreddit can argue til the cows come home about how electable Jeremy is.  But I _really_ resent this implication that people who support Jeremy are in some way going to be content with their lot if he doesn't win in 2020.

&gt; The vulnerable people - single mothers, people on extremely low wages, people having to compete with Eastern European gangs illegally undercutting them - these people won't be taking part in the leadership election at all.

null,false,j2598,null,null,null,"The purpose of this article,  and others like it are to increase the amount of tax the poor pay. 

What?? How can it be? Let me explain. 

The richest can't be taxed. In order for power to be taken away from somewhere,  like a bank account, you need a bigger power. It just doesn't work. So the top dog doesn't need to worry. That's the first thing. I think most people recognise why it's so difficult to tax the rich. Thanks to wikileaks etc it's plain to see politicians aren't the top power. That really should be obvious. 

So the top of the food chain gets missed. OK. Next line down? No. 

It starts nearer the bottom. 

Tax havens are not fair in particular because a business owner has the freedom to move but an employee is restricted a lot more. The business can leverage the market and pay wherever is best for them,  a mix of value and service.  

But here's the thing. It's NOT just the elite who benefit from tax havens and tax planning. You, I,  anyone with an online business can incorporate offshore. At the moment many a business is incorporated in Belize. Especially gambling. 
The ignorance of the masses is to presume that these business are huge. Sure,  some are. But below the pyramid there are small businesses. These are the ones that are hit first, not the big players. That means a harder exit for people in work like you and me. For example, RAK is now favoured by big investment companies. Already this is a lot more expensive than smaller havens. Basically all that's happening is that as the tax market becomes less efficient through anti competitive practices of governments such as the USA (see delaware), prices are pushed up. 

Hate and jealousy are never good emotions to build a revolution upon. 

So what's the answer? It's slow and hardwork.
Increase tax competition.increase freedom of movement. Liberalise the natural persons ability to move. Create new things that makes a job market more efficient. Reduce costs for incorporation slowly,  and allow anyone to do it. Cut red tape for filing,  go online like chile and Estonia have  done. Anything that can be done to improve conditions for the worker. Be competitive on tax to attract business. Provide services better than in tax havens - such as efficient law and courts in English.  

Shortcuts don't work but I think that's what we see. Thus, if you're a middle or. Upper class online business owner I suggest to fight to climb up the ladder as you're in the firing line. 

I would describe anyone who afford a home in the capital of their birth country as poor. That includes a lot of people. Dentists and physicians -  poor. The elite who have the wealth sque the bell curve way higher than anyone seems to imagine. Also,  politicians are often poor,  very poor.

People are suggesting we shoot them, send the army in, send them back to africa and destroy the boats, build a spiked concrete wall etc. etc.

Look, please, don't let the narrative of ""evil immigrants coming to suck our life away"" take over your morality and respect for human life. These are still people. Human beings, just like anyone you know.    
Yes, what they are doing is illegal. They know this. They know that it will be incredibly hard to even feed themselves if they get here, they understand that they will be fucking hunted like dogs, and if they're caught then the life savings they spent on the trip over here will be wasted, only to be sent back home.

They know these risks, and yet they continue to try. Why? Because they are desperate. They are truly that desperate to get away from the hellhole that is their home country.

Now, by international law they are allowed asylum in the first country that will have them. This should be France, but clearly the French are **not** giving them asylum in any way. (Edit: Yes, there is a slum in Calais. A slum with barely any food or shelter and a crazy amount of violence not only internally, but from French citizens harassing and beating the immigrants. It's unnacceptable to treat humans this way, the French need to know this.)   

So we, as the next in line to take these asylum seekers, have 3 options.

1. We refuse them refuge and man the border with rifles, ignoring the problem and leaving them to fester in French slums.

2. We tell France to get their shit together and adhere to international asylum seeker law, whether they like it or not.

3. We take them ourselves, giving them refuge.

There is no option to shoot them and retain the concept that we are a civilised country. It's fucking dispicable that some people are so caught up in the narrative that this is acceptable to them. There is no defence for this line of thought, even if you imply it's just a deterrent, it's inhuman. It's immoral. It's not a path we should be going down as a society.

null,false,ManchesterDavo,1970crest,,null,"I am 46 and I've supported this club all my life. My grandfather worked at Maine Road. I remember going to matches when you only spent a few quid on your day out supporting the club. I was there when Francis was sent off for the headbutt against Everton. I remember Imre Banana. I remember Mark Ward's cracking equaliser at Millwall and then running for our fucking lives after that match. I remember the joy of Clive Allen's header at Port Vale on a cold fucking January day in the FA Cup. I remember getting thrashed by Lincoln City in the League cup. I was bitten by an in inbred at Grimsby. I still hate Oldham scum. I remember jumping up and elbowing my mate in the eye when Dickov scored. 

I'll never forget when Sergio scored. There will never be another day like that one. All the years we followed this club and we finally were able to tell the rag cunts to fuck off! That was golden. I am absolutely loving seeing this club grow into a global power in the world of football. However, there is much I miss about the old days. There are many times I am upset with our owners and the main issue for me is ticket prices. Some others have already mentioned that one but all I'll add is try affording a day out with your family today. I'm not wealthy and I choose carefully when I go to a match and when I don't. The days of going home and away are gone for me. 

I am just another guy on this planet. Who am I to tell someone what they should or shouldn't like to do in the time they aren't at work? If someone in another country enjoys watching the great players we have now I can't say I blame them. It's entertaining stuff. We must remember though that there is a difference between watching these players and being a City fan. If you really are a City fan you will still have your shirt on when were shite again. The day will come and I hope those of you who've come to city in these glory days remain City fans. I remember going on holiday to the states in the 90's and I don't remember anyone talking about football. It seems the game has grown massively and rather recently. 

If some bloke in California wants to watch City whilst having breakfast why should I or any Mancunian be offended? He's not the reason ticket prices are up and smaller clubs are going bust. If we want to blame someone for ruining football in England, blame Sky and Greg Dyke. No yank will ever be as big of a prick as that cockney cunt. Those of us old enough to remember when the Premier League was formed also remember there was talk of how it would impact The Football league and non-league. We have the answer and it is that it is ruining the game. Now I will say that anyone reading this should go to a non-league match. It's the last bit of true football left in England. And if they start playing Premier League matches or FA Cup matches in other countries that will be when I give in and turn my full attention to Glossop North End.",null,0,null,1438262195,null,0,false,0,ctlhaze,null,t3_3f3imi,null,t1_ctlhaze,null,t3_3f3imi,null,null,null,1440177420,null,15,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,15,null

I've been coming here to read advise and learn what I've been doing wrong for some time now.  I've battled with acne prone skin since being 9. My doctor has always been very unwilling to support a referral to a dermatologist, but prescribed me birth control patches that really did help clear my skin up. 

I'm 30 now and I've come off the birth control medication about 3 years ago. Of course I got instand flair up and for a few months I couldn't touch my skin without a spot bursting and thus spreading.

About 2 months ago Someone suggested to come here. I read all the advice and slowly built up a new routine by adding oil cleansing. I've been using self made 30/70 castor oil/ sufflower oil + pure tea tree mix with good results to an extent. (See picture) 

I've been using the visibly clear line of cleanser + moisturiser but I'm not really getting results. It dries my skin and I get sensitive patches so I'm planning on changing routine. I didn't want to change all the things at once! 

I've been patch testing Eucerin 5% urea face cream and the cleanser with SA for 2 weeks now without any flair ups in that area. Fingers crossed. 

Really I just wanted to get more involved with this sub and get support, product advise ect real time. Lurking only gets you so far! 😊 

Current Routine
PM: oil cleanse with self made 30/70 + tea tree
Double cleanse with SA visibly clear wash + lotion
Moisturise with visibly clear 
Vaseline face cover before bed
Am: shower with visibly clear wash
Moisturise with visible clear 
No sunscreen or SPF (want to change that)

As such, flyovers/not-so-subtle military reminders aren't uncommon

- Often times these flyovers are actually paid for in large part by the branch of the military conducting the flyover (the Navy has aviators as well, so it's not always the Air Force).  They are great tools for recruiting, while also helping with my next point...

- The flyovers provide great practice at flying in formation and locating landmarks for rendezvous practice for pilots attempting to meet various flight time requirements/qualifications.  Usually, the pilots are up there learning something.

The underestimation of net migration was identified only by the census on a 10-yearly basis, so the ONS is unable to revise its annual estimates of immigration and emigration as components of migration during the same period, even though it knows that they must be wrong. As a result, for the years from 2001 to 2011, our best estimate of net migration each year is not equal to our best estimate of immigration minus our best estimate of emigration.

Taking a stand at Albacete

Albacete medical assistant, Manolo Bleda: “The club decided to pay the players but not the rest of the staff. When he heard that, Diego refused to train until everyone was paid. In 35 years I have never known anyone else take a stand like that.”

Eduardo Rodríguez Vellando, the Albacete club doctor: “One day the president came into the dressing room. He was going round everyone shaking their hands. Diego waited for his turn, and then kept his hands by his side and asked if the kit men had been paid. ‘I’m not shaking your hand until you pay them,’  he said.”

I happen to agree. If your going to write an article blasting Sinn Fein for their pointless trip, tell us who they talked to, what they talked about, and what if any progress was made. Then depending on the results of that, fire abuse or time/money wasting allegations as you please. But writing an entire article on something that can be summed up in one sentence is fucking stupid. BUT, it does fit in with how politics and news papers here operate so I shouldn't be surprised tbh.

**Music Streaming** (this week) - granted a fraction of the amount of stuff Spotify has but it is a good start. Any fairly mainstream artists you are after they probably have 

**TV/FILM Streaming** - a few things Netflix doesn't have. Most of my viewing stays with Netflix but Amazon is fantastic for Kids. Their Kids selection blows Netflix out of the water. (Obviously only a plus if you have kids or just love my little pony).

**1 free Kindle book** a month to *own* from their new authors selection (basically they give you a choice of 3/4 books each month of promoted new authors and it yours - bit hit and miss). **1 free book to *hire*** from Kindle Unlimited a month - much broader selection and a lot of it is crap but there is some gold in there if you look.

However ... what has been awesome is the **""free digital credit""** they offer. They don't advertise this but basically they have shot themselves in the foot with ""free next delivery"" and needed to encourage people to stagger deliveries. They do this by offering £1 free digital credit if you go for 5 day delivery. It adds up fairly quickly if you order a lot. 

I would suggest **tracking discounts and searching for reduction** rather than trusting the lighting deals (which are normally just clearing shite). 
I tend to rely heavily on uk.camelcamelcamel.com to create wishlists and track basic household stuff. i.e. if 1kg of coffee drops to £7 it alerts me and I buy it. This has saved me a fortune over the last few years. 
Equally there are a fair few ""deal finder"" sites that will allow you construct a search term for items with 50%+ discounts. I have found this really useful to for any big purchases (i.e. on electronics you can see really big price drops from time to time like [this](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/HP-712328-031-ProLiant-Performance-Server/product/B00DPT536Y?active=price_amazon) or [this](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/Sapphire-FIREPRO-S9000-Server-Graphics/product/B00H27HQUG?active=price_amazon)). 

So (at the risk of sounding like an Amazon shill) if you use any of the above in combination it is totally worth it. If you just purchase it for one thing of the above probably not.

I'm not sure what you mean by integration exactly? My workplace is about as mixed as anywhere I've ever worked with people from about 10 different cultures/countries all working quite happily together. We go out together now and then and the Muslims either drink lemonade or get pissed with us guiltily while not mentioning this fact to their parents.

The problem in the 80s was largely racist policing along with quite real colour bars in place in the corporate world. Many things have changed in the intervening 30+ years; I'm struggling to think of anything that hasn't been change for the better, at least in the world of Race Relations.

If you mean integration in the sense of intermarriage then I don't think this is a real issue. Most Jews, who have been in the UK as a community for a very long time, still prefer to marry within that community. Quite a lot have made a choice not to, sometimes with consequences of excommunication from their family and community, other times with an accepting shrug. Sometimes these couple have chosen to raise their kids Jewish or the kids themselves have felt drawn towards that identity as they hit teenage years or just continue to live with no real religious affiliation.


Experience would suggest that the tendency is for greater acceptance and integration as time goes on rather than less. Mixed race partnerships are hardly a big deal any more; when I grew up any white girl sleeping with a black man was simply labelled as a whore. Believe me when I say this place was truly racist in the 60s and 70s. It is much less so now but taking the UKIP stance won't help continue in the right direction.

Okay. Most of our Blue Collar workers who are out of jobs were factory workers. AKA the cost of manufacture in the UK was too damn high. In fact? A lot of the Pakistanis on the list were from a minority brought in to ""work the factories, furnaces and forges"". So they are like the working poor ""out of a job"". 

The UK's changed a lot. The ""blue collar workers"" and labourer are sadly dinosaurs in an economy almost exclusively white collar and service based. A young man in the 50's to the 70's could leave high school aged 16 and be guaranteed a job, nay a career! He would know where he would go to work and he could just show up. 

The world's changed. Even the blue collar workers are educated these days and traditional families who did those jobs are finding the advice given by the older generation to be out of touch. There are kids who leave for work aged 16 who cannot hold down a job because they lack the soft skills or who cannot find a job because everything needs education. 

You cannot get a cheaper plumber. The polish plumbers aren't especially cheaper. What they are is more efficient. When we did our bathrooms the first time round the British plumbers took 3 hours for a simple fitting. The polish ones did it in 1. They are out earning the Brits by being able to take on more work. The Brits had to go drive in their ginormous white van to the local DIY store to get parts, the Polish guys carried a box of parts. I can see why they are eating up the market. They are fast, polite and effective. Rather than do the same we would ban them. 

Oh and FYI? Many of the Chinese and Indians on that list of immigrants work for the NHS (it's also why there are so many Indians on benefits. Many of them are retired doctors on pensions. Like my dad. 35 years of work for the NHS before he retired due to diabetic neuropathy. He still teaches and sees X-rays part time but he's no longer a full consultant. He's on ""retirement"" benefits. I know TERRIBLE. 

Are you honestly telling me that the Chinese and Indians are taking away jobs from blue collar workers? Come on mate. They are generally either upper class students (Chinese) or are Doctors, Lawyers and Engineers (Indians). The people who came from poorer parts of the UK aren't going into those jobs enmasse as they represent a sizeable risk of money and no guarantee of a career until you graduate.

With other midtable sides making pretty good transfers, seemingly better than ours I can't see us improving but we're still too good to get sucked into the lower midfield.

2. Marko Arnautovic will come very, very good this year. At the tail end of last season he was the closest thing we had to an unplayable player (just ask Emre Can), and seeing as Bojan will be rusty coming back from injury Marko's gonna be our star turn this season.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Welcome! Lots of questions ....

- Which prescription topicals are you on/ have tried in the past? If nothing head back to the doctor, being clear your skin is sensitive and easily dehydrated. Potentially useful prescription actives include azelaic acid (AzA) or adapalene (the gentlest prescription retinoid). I would not suggest benzoyl peroxide because it is pretty harsh.

- What is the percentage of tea tree oil you are using?

- How are you removing the excess oil before your second cleanse? Double cleansing is usually only to remove the last traces not all the oil, but without an emulsifier and with a high percentage of thick castor oil you can end up irritating your skin getting it off. 

Cleansers are not the best way to use salicylic acid, it needs to be left on for a period to be effective, and obviously cleansers are washed off. Better option would be a leave on product (salicyclic or mandelic acid) that is free of drying alcohol.

Paula's Choice exfoliants are alcohol free, based on SA and have samples, I particularly like the look of [their treatment] (http://www.paulaschoice.co.uk/clear-daily-skin-clearing-treatment-azelaic-acid-bha.html) with 10% AzA and SA if you don't get AzA on prescription. Other companies that might have acid exfoliants to suit include Ishtar Skinlights and Bravura London.

In general the Visibly Clear line has a lot of harsh or irritating ingredients: menthol, citrus extracts, fragrance, sulphate surfactants, drying alcohol. The [Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash Gel] (http://www.simple.co.uk/our-products/product/kind-to-skin-refreshing-facial-wash-gel.html) is very gentle and popular with some of the regulars.

Needing to use petroleum jelly after your Visibly Clear moisturiser is a strong indicator the routine is not right for you. Eucerin is a good alternative if it works for you. CeraVe PM lotion is another lightweight option, contains 4% niacinamide: available from UK Amazon.

Actives you could consider adding include niacinamide, sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP form of vitamin C), a retinoid (prescription or cosmetic), possibly green tea extract, zinc oxide (as sunscreen tho mineral sunscreens are the devil to find). Check out our ingredients Wiki and mega reviews in the sidebar.

I like the look of [Derma-e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 body] (http://dermae.com/product/343/Antioxidant-Natural-Sunscreen-SPF-30-Body-Lotion.html) with 1% green tea extract and a little SAP. I have had good feedback from those who have tried it; can be ordered via UK Amazon.

I'd argue it's absurd to expect anybody to make any kind of commitment to the party without being able to influence it.

Should votes be weighted like Labour did in the past? (didn't a PLP vote count as 600 normal member votes that kind of thing?) Should you get an extra vote for every leaflet you deliver?

It is a dilemma though. What if UKIP imploded but instead of forming another nationalist group they instead all decided to join the Green Party, and tried to change our policies to frankly idiotic ones!?!?!

Ultimately though we're too big for that to be a threat now. Even if all the kippers joined we still have twice that in membership. They couldn't vote through motions at conference, even if they were super coordinated.

If JC wins it isn't because Labour has been infiltrated, it's because the majority of people who believe in the things Labour says it stands for like 'Equality', 'Justice' 'Compassion' and 'Fairness' don't agree with the policy positions of the ruling elite within the party.

I wish the right of the party would stop saying ""JC's ideas are good, but just not electable"", the job of the party should be to figure out what the right policies are, and then how to implement them, not decide what policies are electable then decide which ones they should actually implement.

[The economists' manifesto - FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7da2852c-e3af-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html)

Professor of economics at Imperial College;

&gt;Haskel’s research finds that government funding of science is the perfect complement to private, practically minded research funding. “This is an example of crowding in,” he says, meaning that if the government spends more on scientific research it is likely to draw in private funding too. There is a high correlation between the research scientists who receive government grants and those collaborating with or being funded by private sector companies. Haskel has found that sectors that attract government funding are also sectors with high productivity growth.

&gt;According to Haskel’s estimates, the rate of return on basic scientific research is around 20 per cent at current funding levels — a level that would not displease Warren Buffett himself. This would probably be less if science funding dramatically increased but, even at 15 or 10 per cent return, the case for spending more would be persuasive.

&gt;An extra £5bn is not trivial. Increasing all income tax rates by one percentage point, or raising VAT to 21 per cent, would cover the cost. But given current ultra-low interest rates, Haskel says he is happy for the government to borrow to fund this spending instead. “I would regard borrowing to fund the science base as a form of infrastructure investment,” he says. It may not be the traditional Keynesian infrastructure of roads and runways but it is investment for the future nonetheless.",null,0,null,1438267109,null,0,false,0,ctlk2hd,null,t3_3f5b2e,null,t1_ctlk2hd,null,t3_3f5b2e,null,null,null,1440178722,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

That said, with perhaps a different partner (Mason?) I think he'll be great. Basically, while Bentaleb and Mason can be effective in DM, we **need** a stronger, taller DM than Mason and Bentaleb together. It will help both defensively with 50/50's in midfield and when we're attacking the opposition in corner kicks. We have a pretty small team - Kane, Vert, Alder, and maybe Chaldi are decently tall. Rose, Davies, Trippier, not going to score heading goals like Ivanovic can.

I read someone's theory that Dier was playing there so that he can better understand the roll of the DM as he remains a CB. 

Either way, i don't see how experimenting like this in pre-season is a bad thing. Truthfully, if we sell Chiriches and Fazio, both DM and CB options will be drastically diminished compared to last season. So having Dier as a back-up in either position is fine for me ATM

Netflix works perfectly. Every single time. It is really amazing that Amazon, with all their AWS resources can't fucking make it work properly. There is a lot of people complaining on Amazon Instant support forums about buffering issues, but it was never acknowledged or addressed officially by Amazon. I would not actually mind paying for both Amazon Instant (Prime, or whatever they call it now) and Netflix because both services have quite a lot to offer, but I guess I will have to stick with Netflix for the time being.  
  
Edit note: Amazon has very strange policy (which does not make sense to me) that their streaming services can be only used with Amazon devices. I think I saw some exception, but you can forget about Amazon on your YouView box. You will need another device made by Amazon. Of course you can watch on your PC, but I think it is kind of waste of electricity when you could use some dedicated player connected  via HDMI directly to your TV or Monitor.

I'm not convinced we are though. We're talking about paranoias and assumptions. Very few actual facts of damage being done to the UK economically, culturally or socially. No riots, no ghettoes. Other than the propensity for people to smash up their own town centres on Friday nights things seem to be ticking along quite nicely.

We're not even engaged in a war at the moment which is pretty bloody amazing. All we seem to have is a whipped up storm by certain media outlets suggesting that Britain is broken and it's because of all the foreign types...

It's not broken. Greece is nearly broken, supposedly. Zimbabwe is pretty bloody broken. Britain is a fully functioning nation with a high standard of living and is positively drowning in success. Count the cars in your road, or the number of flat screen TVs in your home. How many phones in you family? Tablets? iPhones? DVDs, or more likely netflix downloads. Do the buses run? Do the trains run, more or less, to time? Can you afford to buy food? Can you buy petrol 24 hours a day? Can you afford a few beers on a night out? A decent meal in a restaurant? A night out in the cinema (and pay stupid amounts of money for plastic sweets)?

As such at times when the formula seems to have run dry the show can create a new formula and yet still maintain elements and ideas the viewers are familiar with. The biggest change occurred between the Second and Third Doctor eras where the show went from a more space based monster/siege of the week series to an Earth set Avengers style action series with a sci fi bent. Unfortunately this also means that the style or formula that you like may change before its gone stale.

The difference between your examples and the poor guys hanging to landing gear or under lorry is the value they **add**. Not in just  economic but cultural sense. They are also well dissipated throughout the country. There isn't one small town in Britain without an Indian or Chinese restaurant. Because of this they integrate well with the local population.

The situation now is the volume is greater and also densely concentrated. How can anyone expect to adapt to the host country if when they get here they live in an enclave of people from their origin country.

Right: I've never had prescription topicals. My doctor has been very very firm about not sending me for referral. I've never known what to ask for. I think I'll book and have some words. 

Tea tree i use is 100% pure and I dilute to 1ml per 30ml of my 30/70 oil mix. Basically 5 drops. I tested this strength for a month before fulfacing because I was concerned about burns. I use it to make the oil smell nice and for antiseptic properties 

Removing the oil usually goes: cotton round to soak up the excess. Warm water wash, lather up my neutrogena SA face wash. Then I work it on my face gently but for about a minute. I usually leave it on for a few minutes and then wash with warm water. My face is then nice and soft and the oil seems removed. I then lotion clense before moisturiser and Vaseline. If this is wrong, please offer advice. I'm very very happy to learn. 

I'm definitely changing my wash and lotion and moisturiser. The visibly clear does make my face sore. I didn't want to change it during the initial ocm routine. 

as of tonight I'll be using eucerin, but I am going to America in a week and plan to buy careva when I'm over there :) any other suggestions on products would be great.

I'll research all tHe other options offered. I'm going to get some mad hippie vitamin c serum in America. And they have a load of great looking sunscreens too. I really really need a everyday one. I also wil need to consider a SA that stays on.... Paula's choice looks like it's available in USA? Maybe another product to add? 

Diet wise I have a good clean diet. I prepare, cut and cook from scratch. I don't eat ready meals. I'm at the gym 3 times a week and my weight and height and muscle have much improved. Always room for improvement but I'm very much at 'healthy' weight and mucle mass. 

Thank you so much for your interest and help. I really really appreciate it. I'm taking monthly progress photos. It's time I used science to sort out my face! :)

You guys can draw conclusions from last season, but IMO Balotelli, Lambert, Moreno, Markovic, and Lovren, none of those guys are shit. They came into a team that was struggling, of course they won't look good either. 

I just don't get why Moreno, Markovic and Lovren are afforded the extra effort to integrate them into the team while other players are labelled not good enough.

We could copy and paste them into the An Post database.

&gt; How much influence will the Catholic Church have on education and society? 

Hopefully None whatsoever.

&gt; What laws will change? 

I'd say the fairly robust anti-discrimination Laws in the GFA would be enacted in the South, so the Direction of change would most likely be Laws coming from the north to the south rather than the other way about.

&gt; Will there be snap elections after the Dail [or whatever replaces it] changes to accomodate [ex]NI politicians? 

Again Probably not given that the assembly would likely remain in place, for quite a while. It's an interesting question though about dissolving the Dáil and Something new replacing it, that's all up for debate.
 
&gt; Will all NI solicitors and lawyers, judges, doctors, nurses, teachers et al. have to retrain and get different qualifications? Will NI workers be at a disagvantage for having qualifications and exam results that are different and ""foreign""?

Most southern law is based on English Common Law;though there are some differences

&gt; England and Wales has the Rights of Third Parties Act, while in Ireland we don't have that legislation and have the traditional view of privity.^[source](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-English-and-Irish-contract-law)

The Border is quite Porous actually; I have numerous friends both north and south who have studied and worked both North and South without any hindrance.

&gt; What about all the land and property the British Royal Family owns in NI? Will the Irish pay to take it back?

It will be brought into Public Ownership and no it will not be paid back.

&gt; What about members of the British armed forces living in this new Ireland?

I can't see what the the Problem of them living here would be; The British and Irish Armed forces have joint operations and training all of the time.
 
&gt; What about the Irish regiments of the British Army?

I'm sure new battalions would form; and Soldiers would be offered positions, if they so wish.

&gt; What is the UK going to do before a UI's inception to remove all of its infrastructure from what was NI?

Well they won't be doing that; that shit rightfully belongs to the people here; like you and me.

The default 'ready' screen shouldn't require any user input other than swiping your first item. The screen should simply say ""Start swiping to begin"" or something.

If an age restricted item is scanned, it shouldn't lock you out of scanning other items. It should highlight (by means of something more obvious than a feeble little red LED above your checkout) that you need attention, and let you swipe the rest of the items while the assistant walks over.

The screen's UI itself needs a big dose of skeuomorphism. Why not graphically show the items you've bought being dropped into a representation of the Bagging Area with some decent pictorial representations of the items. 

This should all be smoothly animated, with zero lag and with actual human-readable product names (ideally in the font style of the brand/logo), not HEINZ 4PK BEANS&amp;SAUS or SP TOMATO SA.

When they're hitting you with ad hominems in a discussion, you're damn right I love pointing out just how wrong their presumptions are, and then watching them desperately back track as a result. The irony is most of them are projecting, and are from abroad and have never seen their club play live, mind boggling.

I appreciate I may come across as an arsehole when I come out with that stuff mate, but how else should I approach it?

And when you're discussing football in here, often with people from vastly different cultures and perspectives on the game as you said yourself, then sometimes it's important to explain your perspective so they can understand where you're coming from.

That's why I'll often state how I began following City, and in which period, because it's fucking relevant. Just like you doing so here in respect of going in the 80s.

I'm not throwing it into every fifth comment mate, and I'm not trying to make out I'm the biggest blue in the world.

He was cheeky and exciting and really exemplified the idea that the doctor runs.  It took me a bit to get adjusted to Tennant because I just wasn't ready to lose my beloved 9th.  However, after a few I fell in love with him and the same with Matt Smith.

I will say this: it took me a while to come around to Matt Smith and I think a great deal of that was the writing and story telling, but as his and the Ponds stories began to grow and develop I really fell in love with them.  And then there's Capaldi.

With every single doctor I had a waiting period before I fell in love with them.  But not Capaldi.  No no.  I loved that crazy old man from his first appearance (as the doctor not as an ancient Roman).  I'm not sure why.  I guess it's because the dynamic is new and fresh.  Every girl isn't fawning over him now.  He's hard and soft at the same time.  He is as much the doctor as any of his predecessors and this whole doctor being given shit thing?  Rose gave Eccelston and Tennant a bunch of shit.  That's the point of the companions they keep the doctor from going full on war crazy.  It's their bit of humanity that saves him from himself.  Now is Clara a bit whinier than the rest, perhaps, but she is the impossible girl!  Of course she'd be tough to deal with.

&gt; This doesn't mean you should give up on the show but it also doesn't mean that you should force yourself to like it.

I am not saying you have to adapt and I don't think you are shitting on the show. You have legitimate concerns, some I may share and some I don't, that others may share and that others might not. 

All I am saying is that opinions or the show itself can/may change and you shouldn't necessarily give up on the show just because you might not like it right now. Personally I wasn't completely sold on Smith's tenure either at first but when I rewatched his series recently with my SO, I actually found myself enjoying them more. This may never happen for you and that is perfectly fine. Contrary to some fans' beliefs, you don't have to like all of Doctor Who to be a fan of the Doctor Who that you like. There is a possibility that you may never like the show again, but it is far more likely that you will ""catch up"" to the show or the show will ""catch up"" to you.

And I was trying to imply that the issue of the show constantly changing is both a blessing and a curse. It is nice for the show to have a built in element to refresh the show, but unfortunately this also allows for the show to change when it perhaps doesn't need to. However the audience will never agree on when the show needs to and doesn't need to change.

Personally I wish the Sixth Doctor could have had another season or two even as the show existed at the time and maybe the Fourth could have had one or two less (not that I would want that to happen now because I couldn't pick which ones to get rid of).

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"I try hard not to go against doctors advice, but I am not at all clear what yours is playing at by not offering referral nor any topicals. You have the right to request a different doctor in the same practice, and the right to switch practices to another in your area. Research NHS/ local Trust criteria or policy online for referral to a hospital dermatologist. Generally it is for severe acne, acne that is causing scarring, affecting mental health OR not responding to standard prescription treatments. You ought to be eligible since you have acne for such a long time, but if they have never prescribed you any topicals then they might use that as a get out.

The published research on tea tree oil in acne vulgaris is 5% so that would be 1.5ml TTO to 28.5ml base oil. It should be measured by volume (teaspoons/ oral syringes from pharmacy) not dropwise because different density oils may firm different size drops.

Do not leave foaming cleansers on your face, they can damage the skin barrier. I also would not triple cleanse, that is excessive and could mean you are stripping away the entire acid mantle/ beneficial flora. Stick to one or two relatively gentle cleansers. You can add an emulsifier such as one of the polysorbates, cromollient or Sucralgel (will make a melting gel consistency not a liquid oil) to your oil blend to help it rinse clean with water.

Unfortunately that Paula's Choice product is available in Europe but not in the US because 10% AzA is prescription only there apparently. Super frustrating since prescription AzA can be really expensive for them. :( I believe PC have an all mineral sunscreen or two, otherwise that Derma-e is a US company so you might be able to source it cheaper there than on UK Amazon.

This has been my position, we really should set up some kind of processing centre in Lybia (or somewhere) which is a secure zone for dealing with asylum. Spend the international aid money there and have a proper system.

There was the post-study work visa that gave every non-EU students the opportunity to stay for a further 2 years upon graduation to find work. I imagine it won't be too hard for them to switch to the proper work visa and potentially, permanent settlement after that. 

Then it turned out that a lot of foreign 'students' abused this post-study option, enrolling in some no-name college in hope of getting the permission to work after that. So in 2012 (I think?), the post study work visa was abolished by the Tories. Since then, it's significantly harder for non-EU students to stay in the country after their studies. My observation is only the PhDs and to a limited extent, some of the truly exceptional non-EU masters students who can pull this off now and actually get a job sponsorship upon graduation.

   - We lost Begovic and N'Zonzi, two of our best players so now Jack Butland MUST shine because we only have Given and Haugaard to fall back on.
   - We signed Wollscheid, who had an iffy season on loan with us at best.
   - We signed Glen Johnson, someone who hasn't performed well this decade.
   - We signed Affellay an injury prone has-been/never-was-much.

- When you consider these signings it's easy to see we haven't really progressed in this transfer window, and when you remember we also lost Moses who was on loan with us this season, I simply don't see us improving from last year's results. 


- Bojan, he started last season slow as he was gaining weight to play in the premier league and his season was cut short by injury. If he comes into the Liverpool game 100% fit and ready then he will have an excellent season.

Okay. Google up high Asian areas. Then google up ""Old factory/industrial towns"". 

Rotherham? Steel Industry. Manchester? Factories. Same for Birmingham, Tower Hamlets? Same. In fact as you go along you see a distinct correlation between Old Factory Towns and high density of Muslims. Let's face it that's what you meant. 

Now the fun thing here is this. Muslims were the night shift on factories. The reason take aways and kebab places open late was to cater for them since originally few white people ate our food. This sadly meant Muslims couldn't integrate for the same reason that if you have a friend who is a doctor he won't be a very good friend (he will miss out on a lot of events). They were at work when everyone was socialising. Remember most Indians and Sikhs don't drink alcohol either and its only my generation that drink at all. My parents buy cheap wine, try it and make a face. That's it They don't go to pubs. 

Integrate well? Indians and Chinese are rather more insular. I am afraid the anglicised Chinese food in take aways is a far cry from what Chinese food is really like. And Indian restaurants that cater to Indians are very different.... 

This is Indian food... 
http://www.chennaidosa.com/
This is what my parents go get when  they want ""Indian food"". 

Been to Chinatown in Manchester. Chinese people don't live there but their food shops are very different to what you get. Indians have their same stores. Where we get things like Indian Mango juice (I am afraid westernised mangos are not sweet enough and you guys don't get sour mangoes) or hell things like durian. 

The fact is when people bring up ""integration"" what they mean is ""stop being visibly different"". Indians and Chinese tend to not be visibly different in public and when you do see Indians you assume they are Muslims and blame Pakistanis for it. 

Edit - I figure you should read this. http://theaerogram.com/hair-brownness/ It's enlightening for a lot of people who don't realise what even the ""Model Minority"" of Indians go through.

I'll get me some of those mini syringes again to measure the tea tree. I always measure my oil into a 30ml container so I can take it with me and keep it as fresh as possible. :) 

I'll look into adding an emulsifier to my oil. Are there any brands I should look for in particular? I'm going to just use my eucerin cleanser from now on and see how that goes down. Followed up with the 5% night cream. I'll probably keep my Vaseline cover until I'm sure that the other changes are not causing issues. I don't like to change to many things. Otherwise I'm like 'what has caused this?' 

I'm pretty confused about what's available where now :) I'll look into Paula's choice. Also the American options. I'm lucky that I've got friends who will send top ups when I need them, so if I find a HG item I won't have to worry :) 

I do eat plenty of oily fish. I'm a chicken and fish type of girl. :) without a word of a lie, my doctor insisted it was my fish eating that was causing my skin issues. Not because I've had any allergy tests, but because he felt oily fish makes oily skin. I ignored that piece of Bs and asked for a food allergy test. Denied!

* If you are considering working, all you need is a national insurance number (NIN). You can apply for an interview as soon as you have a permanent address (staying in student accommodation will be enough for you to apply for NIN).
* As for your budget, I believe 8k will be enough for you during your first year. I hear that Aberdeen is a bit pricy. However I think that you will be able to afford to go on a night out, and still have enough money to cover your expenses (you will have enough money to party a couple times a month)

Trying to address your questions in order:

1) Double check the eligibility requirements of support from the SAAS, and have you already got your application in (the deadline was last month I think)?

2) The left lane is the slow lane - ride carefully. :)

3) Bank of Scotland is fine for a current or student account, but apply early, there may be a lot of admin to sort out with you being an international student. And they may not offer you an overdraft at first.

4) Bring your passport for ID purposes.

5) Getting a credit card and starting to use it (paying off in full every month) would be a good idea. There are a few that specialise in helping to build or repair a credit rating; Aqua Card are one I've used in the past.

6) If you want a job when you're here, you will need a national insurance number, which you can apply for here: https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"I think the big problem is that those in the political sphere tend to forget that your average voter isn't thinking in the same terms as those in the political sphere. They think voters are concerned about and right/left, and about specific policies, and this isn't helped by the fact that people are generally not very good at expressing how they are actually feeling, and use particular cases to describe their mood.

It's frustrating seeing Labour talking about what voters want with the political blinkers on, constantly misreading the cries of exasperation as voters try to explain why they lost faith in Labour.

The Iraq War was just the trigger that caused the electorate to snap, being the case that highlighted the problems people were having with Labour - that they simply lost the ability to trust a party that was constantly lying and misleading the electorate, whilst completely acting dismissive of the views of the electorate. I mean I was too young and naive to vote during Blair's term, but I still remember the constant talk about Peter Mandelson and his ~~little birds~~ spin doctors. People's thoughts of Labour were of this incredibly seedy party, who would sell off other people's souls if it meant consolidating more power. People, in general, care more about their own personal safety and security (financial and physical) than about any particular policy.

Like, the right of the party have started throwing out lines like ""the electorate didn't think they could trust Labour's economic plan in the 2015 manifesto"". When what the electorate is actually saying is ""We don't trust Labour, FULL STOP."" We don't have people yelling ""Liebour"" simply because Ed Miliband stood on a slightly left platform...

&gt; how many extra TDs will there be?

This is a difficult one to answer since the number of TDs and size of their constituencies is based on population, and that's assuming that the Dáil will stay in its current form post-UI. It more than likely won't as there's a provision in the Irish Constitution that provides for a Federal system of government in the event of a United Ireland. Stormont more than likely will continue on as a ""state"" parliament for the 9-county province of Ulster. The Dáil will more than likely become a Federal Parliament in the same way as the U.S Congress.

&gt; What happens to our roads? Do we just change everything to kph?

Nothing will happen to your roads, we already drive on the same side of the road with the same cars, a different admin body will be responsible for their maintenance, that's it. Yes they probably be in kph, but since most cars sold have speed dials in both mph and kph that's a non-issue.

&gt; What about driving licenses? What about passports?

What about them??, they'll still be valid. With regards to passports, those who already have British passports will still be able to keep and renew them, when the South became a republic the British Government passed a law that stated those who were born on or before the 1st of January 1949 were still entitled to British and Irish citizenship, those born afterwards aren't, just Irish citizenship. The same thing will more than likely apply post-UI.

&gt; How much influence will the Catholic Church have on education and society?

About as much as they have now, very little in the day to day lives of people. I mean no disrespect when I say this but the fact is NI is under greater influence from the various sects of Protestantism than the South is under Catholicism.

&gt; What laws will change?

/u/JunglistMassive has answered this question better than I ever could.

&gt;  Will all NI solicitors and lawyers, judges, doctors, nurses, teachers et al. have to retrain and get different qualifications?

Solicitors, lawyers, doctors and nurses have to regularly re-train anyway, as laws change and new medical techniques and technologies become available. Same with teachers as the curriculum evolves. I don't see why they'd have to re-train just because of a UI vote.

&gt; Will NI workers be at a disagvantage for having qualifications and exam results that are different and ""foreign""?

No. In the same way Irish workers currently in the UK aren't at a disadvantage.

&gt; What about all the land and property the British Royal Family owns in NI? Will the Irish pay to take it back?

Again /u/JunglistMassive knows more about this than I.

&gt; What about members of the British armed forces living in this new Ireland?

If they're still active duty/reserve members currently enlisted in the British Armed Forces then they will be transferred to another barracks with their regiment and the Irish Defence Forces will take up a presence in NI.

&gt; What about the Irish regiments of the British Army?

I don't see much changing with regards to the Irish regiments. Irishmen/Irishwomen from the Island of Ireland still remain a steady source of recruitment to the British Army, and they form a large enough demographic bloc that (IMO) will ensure the survival of the Irish regiments in one form or another.

&gt;Earlier this month, Ai Weiwei was finally given back his passport, which had been confiscated by the Chinese authorities.
Just weeks later, he has found himself in the middle of a visa row — not with Beijing, but with London — becoming the latest high-profile critic of the UK’s attempts to curry favour with the Chinese government.

Over the last few years human rights activists and allies in Washington have become increasingly frustrated as the prime minister gas has set off in enthusiastic pursuit of the Chinese renminbi.
Having angered Beijing in 2012 by having his photograph taken meeting the Dalai Lama, Mr Cameron has since been assiduous in courting the Chinese government.
In 2013 he indicated he had no plans for further meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader, and sealed the rapprochement later that year by taking Britain’s largest ever trade delegation to China.
Last year, Mr Cameron dismayed pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong with an apparent reluctance to criticise Beijing over its attempts to change the voting system in the province.
George Osborne, the chancellor, is now leading attempts to forge trading links between the two countries. But again his key decision to sign up to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a Chinese rival to the World Bank, has enraged the government’s allies — this time in Washington.
Now British ministers have the wrath of the artistic community to contend with. Just months before a major exhibition at the Royal Academy, officials have denied Ai Weiwei a full six-month visa, choosing to end his right to stay in the UK at the end of September.
The home office says this is because he failed to declare a conviction on his application form. His supporters point out that though he has been arrested in the past, he has never been convicted, and allege the timing has more to do with the visit of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in October.
Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, a campaigning organisation, said: “The British government has said repeatedly in recent months that freedom of speech and expression are key British values. The home office needs to show this in deeds, not just words.”
Tim Marlow, artistic director of the Royal Academy, took a more cautious line, saying: “We hope for a speedy resolution to this service.” But Mr Ai’s own gallery in the UK, the Lisson Gallery in Marylebone, was damning: “We trust and hope this decision is based on a misunderstanfing and will be quickly corrected.
“As a Chinese citizen and leading cultural figure Ai Weiwei deserves full rights of entry to the UK where his huge audience looks forward to greeting him for the first time in five years.”
Two Labour members of the foreign affairs select committee — Ann Clwyd and Mike Gapes — also condemned the decision.
For Mr Ai himself, the decision is a particular disappointment after the Chinese authorities returned his confiscated passport earlier this month. On Thursday he posted a statement in the comments section of his Instagram account next to a picture of a toilet. It read: “This decision is a denial of Ai Weiwei’s rights as an ordinary citizen, and a stand to take the position of those who caused suffering for human rights defenders.”
The home office defended its actions however. A spokesman said: “All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the relevant legislation. Mr Ai has been granted a visa for the full duration of his requested dates of travel.”

&gt; Our source added:  ‘Most people were surprised that the Andorra match sold out, so we decided to offer it to armchair supporters free. Some 26,000 watched the game on the internet.

&gt; “Malta wasn’t sold out, hence we didn’t offer it free. These are all marginal decisions, had we known Andorra would have sold out we’d have sold it to TV.’

I think the case for direct participation is stronger where the issue is of a relatively local scope. There is a case at for it at the national level and big decisions too but it's important to get the balance right as well -- if it's too abstract it can be harder for any one individual (in the context of the sheer scale of modern society) will impact another group or sector.

It's a long season, Gabby has already picked up an injury and out of all those strikers we could potentially have, Ade is the only one who's regularly bagged 15-20 league goals in England.

So if you ask me, we still need more than one striker and four-five 'senior' strikers plus Robinson is certainly not too many, it just gives us options and depth. Ayew and Gabby can both play wider too, so there's flexibility in the system with the players we're bringing in.

Before revealing the 100 most expensive players in the Premier League era – after our TPI inflation has been applied – please allow me to provide a brief explanation, for those who don’t want to click on the hyperlink. (Feel free to scroll to the end to see the list, although don’t then complain that it doesn’t make sense…)

The latest TV deal saw an increase of 70% on the previous payment agreement; meaning that, much like previous TV deals, there’s been a fairly hefty increase in the money clubs are receiving. And yet people still seem shocked by the inflation of transfer fees (and wages); or simply don’t seem to grasp the concept. Even comparing prices from 2012 against those of today is fairly pointless without inflation, such has been the size of the rise.

**Since 1992 there has been an eleven-fold increase in the average price of a Premier League footballer.** This increase was calculated by Graeme Riley for the Transfer Price Index we created, which we’ve been keeping track of since 2010.

**However, in just the past two years there’s been an increase of 62% in the average price of a Premier League footballer; not far off the 70% rise in TV money – to show how the two go hand-in-hand.** Our current prices are in “2015 money”, which is calculated from the spending of the 2014/15 season; it may well be that spending in the coming season sees a further dramatic rise, but that will be calculated to form 2016 money in a year’s time.

No matter how many times I explain it, there are always requests as to how it’s calculated, or people saying “an inflation calculator gave a different result”. Football inflation runs at a much higher rate than normal inflation (although football inflation did crash with the stock markets at the end of the last decade). Did your grocery bill go up by 62% in the past two years?

We use a model that is identical in methodology to the Retail Price Index (tracking the average cost of several items of produce), but we apply it to footballers, not milk, bread and coffee.

Yes, there are high outliers who perhaps drag the average up, but also free transfers to drag it down. It can be tweaked, twerked and twiddled, but we prefer to keep it as a simple calculation, onto which we put no fancy frills. Perhaps we could track the rate the richer clubs increase it by, but even relegated clubs are picking up over £60m in a single season.

For the purposes of practicality we stuck to English football in the Premier League era, as it was enough of a task finding all the data for that (and doubly hard to find accurate reporting of fees). We don’t take into account contract length at the time of a move, or any age adjustments, although the latter can be tracked; so we can work out what is a high fee for a 31-year-old, but whatever that fee is it goes into the pot the same as all the others. The same is true regardless of what position the players play (and aside from goalkeepers, players can change position, or be utility men, which makes it more complicated.) Also, we use the price reported in sterling, not Euros. If we were a full-time business we might delve into the data to a greater degree, but we’re doing this in addition to our day jobs (and in my case, to add another layer to TTT). We hope to do more with the data, when we get the chance.

With inflation, the top three purchases of the Premier League era work out at a fraction over £80m; which is in keeping with what top Premier League players have been sold for (Ronaldo, Bale and Suarez, although with inflation, Ronaldo is well over £100m; although that’s using our TPI inflation, not anything relating to Spanish football – although Graeme touched on that issue here.)

Before getting onto the Top 100 (as of 23rd July 2015), I just wanted to make a note on how people compare transfer fees. I read last week that Liverpool were prepared to pay £32.5m for Christian Benteke when Arturo Vidal was only going to cost “£28m”. And yet one is 24, and the other is 28.

If you don’t think age plays a part, think again. In the same way as driving a car off a forecourt sees it lose a large chunk of its value, then buying someone aged 28-30 is effectively throwing away a big percentage of the transfer fee. In addition to wages, which may be higher for players in their supposed prime, approximately 75% of the fee has to be written off. (All of this analysis excludes free transfers.)

Buy a younger player, and on average a loss will still be made after inflation is taken into account – but it will be far less damaging. For every £9m spent on players aged under 28, £6m will be recouped. In other words, only 35% gets “lost”, as opposed to the 75% that gets lost on players aged 28-30. Some clubs can afford to take this hit; others can’t.

Was Robin van Persie a wise investment by Man United? He played a key role in their last title (so you can say that it made sense) and yet, it seems, his decline played a role in United dropping to 7th and 4th. After inflation, the van Persie deal loses £33m in transfer fees alone, plus the massive wages (c.£40m) that he effectively only earned one year out of three. Someone like Gonzalo Higuaín was just 24 at the time, and may have been a wiser long-term investment – although United had also started struggling when buying younger players.

Of the top 30 most expensive 28-30-year-olds signed in the Premier League era – therefore what collective wisdom would have labelled “ready made” players – there are a whole host of flops and disappointments of various degrees: Shevchenko, Veron (Chelsea), Soldado, Ince (Liverpool), Berg (Man Utd), Fernandinho, Kolo Toure (Man City), Saunders (Villa), Bilic (Everton), Flo (Sunderland), Keane (Liverpool), Platt (Arsenal), Casiraghi, Samba (QPR) and Scales (Liverpool). These cost between £20m – £82m in today’s money. Not all were dreadful, but none justified the fee. Only seven of the 30 ‘peak years’ signings played over 100 Premier League games for the club they joined.

I do think £50/day is quite high though. It seems like you want quite an extravagant lifestyle (coffee, eating out etc) but you can try to cut back in some places. Go on Groupon to find nice restaurant deals, you can go to really nice restaurants  for a lot less at lunchtime rather than dinner, find happy hours for drinks, don't shop at waitrose, etc.

No, it evolved into early modern English, it didn't just stop. There was a clear progression from early Middle English, to late Middle English and then early Modern English. 

By contrast, Cornish had shrivelled up and died as a language (the last native speaker being Dolly Pentreath in 1777, whose death marked the end of its use as a community language), it had no common syntax and had differing vocabulary depending on where in Cornwall you were (unlike Middle English which stabilised  as a result of the printing press which led directly to early modern English). It has been ""revived"" several times, notably in 1904 by  Henry Jenner, jump started again in the late 1920s and early 30s by Robert Nance. The most recent attempts in the mid 1980s by Ken George, Nicolas Gendall and Nicolas Williams culminating in a language that only standardised in 2005. 


Oh and just for funsies, I looked up the figures. According to the 2011 census, the total number of people who call Cornish their first language is 557. There are more Welsh people living in Cornwall than there are primarily Cornish speakers. I actually expected there to be far more.

null,false,skunkd,,Belfast,null,"&gt;Are you seriously suggesting that A&amp;E figures are being artificially skewed because people in the south are traveling north **in an emergency** to avail of the NHS. Come on Skunkd, seriously?

Not sure why you're underlining the fact they use emergency services in an emergency. I know a few cases anecdotally where the 'emergency' was due not to sudden need while in NI but cost of treatment whether emergency or not in the south. 

Not saying it's going to be a big factor, just stating it's more relevant in a discussion on relative service than some news article on UK waiting lists in isolation. IE there's more demand because what you get is much better value.

Professional north/souther Andy Pollack agrees. He also did a comparison on waiting times 4 years ago and argues the NI health service is not just better funded but structurally better with better management. I know the 80 odd % figure is now 70 odd, but it's still markedly better than the Republic's pay at the gate system.

http://sluggerotoole.com/2011/01/31/why-is-the-republic%E2%80%99s-health-system-so-poor/

&gt;If you can find an actual side by side comparison i'll more than happily go through it you; bring biscuits, i'll but on the kettle.

The guy attempted it, you say odds confused. Given the argument presented above I'll need to see evidence before believing the southerner's view of his own heath service is incorrect.

""Way back when, some Brits fled their country after kicking the Spanish Armada's ass. These religious refugees found a harsh land, and had to become the biggest badasses to deal with it. Their survival and wealth inspired other Brits to come on over and try their luck. Rich folk, poor folk,  didn't matter. 

Later, the French showed up, and a British American lieutenant gave them a proper ass kicking! He humbly requested the king, that America could expand westwards, but was rebuked! This continues the theme. Poor American businessmen only wanted to expand their practice in the name of freedom and money,  but crazy George wouldn't have that, so we kicked his ass off the face of the continent!

The next major conflict was between the freedom loving northerners and the raggedy ass, racist south. It was a technological boon compared to precious conflicts, breech loading rifles, trench warfare, repeating rifles, iron clad ships,  mmm! Proper freedom producing firepower.  Anyway, freedom won and the racists went off to south America and Germany....

Which brings us to the next two conflicts! The Kaiser could not do with his little country in the name of breathing room, but unlike us he wasn't expanding the name of freedom,  so after those Brits kept not kicking the Hun's ass, we had to show up and do it for him! And again when that Hitler fellow showed up. We kicked them all the way from France in the name of freedom. Then we had to bring freedom to space, since the Russians were trying to turn the moon red! Well the moon is white! And free! So why can't we keep all of our freedom producing weapons?""

One thing i would say about this is if people were being shipped in who would work much harder than you and do your job for 50% of the price i doubt you'd be happy, if we start basing pay and work ethic around  workers from much poorer countries most of us are fucked.

For instance an engineer (IEng) in the UK will earn 42k on average and work maybe 40 hours a week (for example) if a russian engineer would work 50 hours a week for 30k a year should the British engineer have to lower their wages and work more to compete with the Russian engineer. Because this is exactly the issue people have with immigration, is that they're getting pitted against workers who are used to much lower standards of living (so don't need the same pay and will work more). 

It may be nice for some middle class folk to get their piping done half price but i bet the tune would change if it was their jobs.

Aussies have been arguing for 20 years that asylum seekers should be forced to go to the nearest UN High Commission for Refugees and apply there (because there is one in Jakarta and most of their boat people come through Indonesia), but that's not the convention in international law.

I predict a similar finishing position to last season but with different teams around us given that Everton will be back up and Southampton and West Ham will be dealing with Europe hangover. We should kick on from the start given that we haven't lost any players and gained some great ones in Ayew and Tabanou.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

We have more than a coupe of candidates for this position. I'm sure Fabianski and Siggy will continue to impress along with Williams as the core of our team. Then we have Ayew who is more than capable to make a name for himself if he starts well.

**How do you think the team will lineup?**

null,false,listyraesder,null,null,null,"&gt; Are you telly me a Wholly owned subsidiary of the BBC can't sell at whatever cost it wants to itself?

It cannot, for a few reasons. It would infringe Article 101 of the TFEU, as it would distort market competitiveness. 

Secondly, it would breach the BBC Charter, which holds the BBC to an obligation to not artificially distort the UK media market. It must be a good corporate neighbour to its competitors and must engage in fair dealing with them.

Thirdly, it would negatively and artificially affect the royalties payable to the screenwriter, director and recording/publishing rights holders for any music. Frank Darabont brought a lawsuit against AMC for allegedly colluding between AMC Studios and the AMC Network (separate companies under the same corporate owner) to artificially keep the show's budget (and hence his residuals) lower than it would be if AMC Studios had sent the show out to other bidders.

&gt; are you telling me they can't sell it as a 'package' along with all the other BBC programs that DAVE shows.

This would be very hard to administer, as some shows would find an audience on the UKTV channels, and others wouldn't. Similarly, different rights are held by different entities, through co-production or production or some other means. Above all, the best value to the licence fee payer would be from selling the shows individually.

BBCW wouldn't even *want* to sell to UKTV at a reduced rate anyway. The remit of BBCW is to maximise the value to the licence fee payer by bringing in the most money from commercial activities. It sells its content to the highest bidder regardless of who owns it.

UKTV is a 50/50 Joint Venture between BBCW and Scripps. So for every show UKTV purchases or commissions, you could say that 50% of that money is from BBCW and 50% from Scripps. So there's no benefit in reducing the money BBCW receives from the Scripps half of the company.",null,0,null,1438280090,null,0,false,0,ctlt629,null,t3_3f55j4,null,t1_ctlt629,null,t1_ctlmpv1,null,null,null,1440183075,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

You have a choice between the Brit and the Russian. The Brit does the work in 40 hours and charges 42K, the Russian does it in 20 hours and charges 42K. Who would you pick? Even from the viewpoint of equal salaries and not a per hour rate it is better to go for the Russian. If that's an hourly rate then the Russian is way better too. 

The standard of living is the same in the UK. Seriously? Have you been to Poland? It's not Somalia mate. 

I got my piping done half price because they did the job in half the time to the industry standard and at the industry rate. They had a break at the end of the job, not halfway through.

PL position on Christmas day	- 9th. I think we'll be the opposite of last year and lag a bit to begin with but pick it up after christmas.




Total number of points	- 58.




FA Cup round reached	      - 5th round




League Cup round reached	       - 4th round
Europa League round reached	 - Semi-final. Fuck it, we might do get there. We have players with a range of backgrounds so this might be this year's surprise.

 


Top scorer (all competitions)	- Pelle.




Total number of goals scored (all competitions)	- 85




Total number of goals conceded (all competitions)	   - 60. Although this depends on when Forster is back in the team. 




Total number of yellow cards (all competitions)	- 50




Total number of red cards (all competitions)	   -  4




Most disappointing player	   -  Steven Davies. He has a good game here or there but even then he's never that impressive. I think he'll have more sub appearances than starts this season.

That's the thinking which needs tackled. We need to promote the fact that cyclists have every bit as much right to use the road as motorists and ensuring that those motorists who refuse to accept that are banned from driving and given criminal records - no more sly winks and pats on the back from kindly mister plod.

There isn't much evidence of the truly disadvantaged on Reddit.  We don't generally see abused women, the very poor/homeless, any widely disadvantaged ethnic minorities (who make up many of our poorest in the cities) and so on.   If one wanted to be slightly classist, but not really inaccurate, the level of discourse (in terms of language used and factual information displayed), general quality of spelling and grammar, and knowledge of current affairs on UK and UKPolitics suggests most regular contributors have the kind of reading and writing skills that many of the poor, or even the working class target audience of the Sun, for example, do not possess. 

It's possible to understand demographics (not fully, but to a reasonable degree) by looking at cultural trends, and while Reddit doesn't like rich people or conservatives very much, the way it talks about poor people, black people, women, and the way it discusses things like Netflix, ordering regularly from Amazon, certain trends at popular chain restaurants, weddings, asking out girls, going on holiday and so on over periods of months or years strongly suggest that the middle-class male demographic on the site is one that *chooses* to procrastinate online because it's fun or because they're addicted to the internet, rather than because they are otherwise poor.

So now they can hate paki paedos and blame pinkos, that's perfect.

Your making a lot of assumptions. I'm from the Midlands so I'm well versed in the differences between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims. Harder to separate are the Polish, Bulgarian, Romainan, Slovakian. I have to go by the licence plates on their cars.

 It's unfair to suggest I would automatically blame Pakistanis.

 I also know the restaurants that cater to Indians and the food they eat, because I'm usually sat next to them, eating with them. I've lived with foreign students that had home cooked meals, sent in tins from Hong Kong (originally from Mumbai but living in Hong Kong), that would blow the paint from the cupboard doors with their power. Been to Sikh weddings and had home dinners cooked by Kurds from Iraq. 

I don't have a problem with looking different. I do have a problem lack of integration. All my friends are western in outlook. Enough to feel outsiders in the countries of their families origin when back there, even if on occasion they feel outside the mainstream here.

The only ham fisted way of describing I can think of would be;

Take a glass of water. When you add cordial to it, the cordial mixes, and makes the rest of the water taste better. If you keep them separate and sip a bit of each you either get bland water or overpowering sweet cordial.

That sounds really crap but it'll do.

*Get insurance for your possessions, make sure your insurance covers your laptop outside your room, and from 'open door thefts' (very common when drunk housemates don't lock doors)

And I would disagree with your assertions on a few of them but that's hardly suprising when we're dealing with sandbox ideas. 

The main things would be about the removal of infrastructure. I mainly mean things like Army bases, police stations [such as police HQ in Knock or Castlereagh Road and the like], and British government buildings like the Civil Service at Stormont, prisons, even some of what is inside Stormont, British museums here, National Trust stuff. That doesn't belong to the people here, it's in private hands or ""foreign"" hands. I hardly think it would be ""right and proper"" to begin this new political experiment on a bad footing with your closest trade partner. It would be like a UI defaulting on its debts to Britain because it's a brand new country [if they are indeed still indebted by this time]. But I presume it will be ironed out [or already has been] by civil servants in Dublin and London. 

And I'm pretty sure the British government will want all its files and documents, internal systems, and anything covered under the OSA or valuable brought back too.

Same with the stuff the Royals own like Hillsborough. It might ""rightfully"" belong to us. But it doesn't legally belong to us. I'd presume they'll be able to keep it or have it bought off them. It'll be great for the papers, I'd love to write that story.

But beyond that, cheers, i fully expect the hand over to take years and a lot of talking  anyway. Probably more than a decade. And to be watched closely by the UN and EU and NGOs, who will give advice and whatnot. I'd also hope that NI politicians have as little to do with it as humanly possible because it'll be a fucking mess if that happens. I'd much rather smart people are involved, I don't see many smart people in Stormont.

Well of course they are, nobody said they weren't. A United Ireland is an aspiration, nobody said it was a reality. Everything we are discussing here is hypothetical, that is the nature of an aspiration.

&gt; The 'imagineering' coming from nats in the thread reminds me of SNP's all things to all people arguments prior to the Scots indie ref. Any and all ideas to be breathlessly funded by north sea oil. Someone followed up on the projected (and disputed) rights to income after the referendum, think it was the Telegraph, and oils sudden collapse in price. The plans were ludicrous even if they got all the rights they said Westminster owed them and would have resulted in an immediate economic crash in Scotland if left as is.

Well the ""Imagineering"" is in full swing now in Scotland, as seen with the rise in the SNP; the fear mongering has hardly dampened the spirit of those seeking independence. Whether you like it or not these types of conversations are increasingly going to happen both here and in Scotland.

[The article you posted](http://sluggerotoole.com/2011/01/31/why-is-the-republic%E2%80%99s-health-system-so-poor/) earlier is a love letter of sorts to a publicly funded and centrally operated health system which should be implemented in the south of Ireland, which in case you missed it was the actual point of the article and which the article points out is well within the grasp of the southern government; it is of course a matter of political will. 

The Article thought is a little disingenuous though; as pointed out in the comments, the author compares the average of all hospitals in the North with just four in the south which skews the result.

&gt; You are comparing the average across all hospitals in the north to (presumably) the 4 worst in the south.

First up, would like to see if anyone would be interested in swapping motherboards - green no longer fits my colour scheme. Details below.

Secondly, got some old parts lying around - an older CPU and mobo combo and a bunch of old 80mm fans pulled from old PSUs. Also have two pretty much new Sickleflows - came in a case I bought and changed them out instantly. 

Prices include postage and PayPal fees.

If you want to see the real Highlands then go to [Aviemore](http://www.visitaviemore.com/) - however you'll be spending at least five and a half hours of your day on the train and you really need good weather to properly enjoy the scenery.

If you want to see small-town Scotland and some nice scenery then get the train to Pitlochry. Get the direct train so you go over the Forth Bridge and you'll be there in about 100 minutes. If the weather's good then do one of the walks listed [here](http://www.pitlochry.org/things_to_do_pitlochry/local-walks.htm) or see if you can get to [Loch Tummel](http://www.visitscotland.com/wsimgs/1047065_1963402182.jpg), around 10 miles away. Once you've built up a healthy appetite you can head back to Pitlochry for some good Scottish food. If the weather isn't good or if you're interested in whisky you can go on a tour at one of the local distilleries. You could then head back to Edinburgh via Perth or Stirling and stop off in one of those towns for a bit. All these places have good websites for tourist information so just have a look online and see what kind of thing catches your eye.

It maybe illegal everywhere but it rarely happened in Britain and never in the quantities until now. So much so it now has its own day. Would you say these perpetrators are integrated into British culture? I wouldn't.

2. It's north African, which means it's non conformist immigrant behaviour and non British. Christians that practice this are as bad as anyone. You keep pulling it back to Islam. Not I. 

3. Correct. Again a cultural obsession with family and disrespect, that Britain managed to grow out of, being reintroduced by those not willing to conform. 

I'll point out again it's the culture I'm objecting to. At no point have I criticised Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism or Christianity. As an atheist they're as good as each other to me.

Don't let that put you off though, I'll still be around on there -- we just need to spread the word more.

General internet usage restrictions depend greatly on your college. Churchill for example has a 25GB(!) daily cap, whereas IIRC some other colleges (\*cough\* Trinity \*cough\*) have horrifically low caps.

Even if he shot, the keeper would have it covered. Yes, we will concede a lot more shots on target but it is so much better than wishfully committing to a tackle.

I think the part about the choosing teams from different cities is interesting, it just not that way at all (or at least wasn't 10-20 years ago, apart from Liverpool/United) in England, which is maybe why I don't understand the nature of foreign fans.

null,false,DrFapkinstein,null,null,null,"&gt; [TDs]Firstly, i'd say the Assembly would remain intact for some time; within a Federal arrangement; that would see a joint initiative from both Britain and Ireland overseeing the transition. During this period i would imagine we would have serious consultation from all parts on how effectively representation would work in the Dáil.

'joint iniative' what does that mean? There's a bunch of possibilities - A federal state with two sub-states north and south and a federal parliament (Dáil Éireann), this seems quite unlikely to me. Maybe NI would keep its autonomy and everything would work preety much the same except with the Dáil overseeing things instead of Westminster. NI could just be subsumed into the south. Or perhaps some other option like a federal system based on the provinces. Regarding number of TDs, I imagine there would have to be a boundary commission set up to determine the proportional number of seats, the North has higher population density so would have proportionally more seats. I can imagine some arrangements being included like more TDs for protestant areas or more TDs for the north in general. All that would have to be worked out. I agree it could be very sticky, especially if unionist parties and politicians boycott the talks which is incredibly likely.

&gt; (Driving licenses?) They will remain valid for the normal period until they need replaced.

Yes most likely, I'm not sure there's much difference between an Irish license and a European license on Irish roads anyway.

&gt; (Postcodes?) We could copy and paste them into the An Post database.

Seems unlikely, the two systems are completely different. They'll probably remain different though until there's a need to overhaul the whole system at some point in the future.

&gt; (Catholic Church influence) Hopefully None whatsoever.

We can all hope lots of things but the commenter is asking what will actually happen in practical terms. In terms of education, the system in the south is segregated similar to the one in the north, there are protestant schools, catholic schools and secular schools, all of which get state funding, and then private schools which get less funding. However, this is changing slowly to a secular system with reduced Church influence. If it became fully secular before a UI, it would lead to complications - do we unify the system and make northern schools all secular? This would undoubtedly be unpopular among both religionists in the north, or do we keep it divided? This might be a politically easier option. The bigger issue regarding education is will we teach Irish language and history in all schools and will it be mandatory in protestant schools?

Regarding Church influence in society, it currently has next to none, so this isn't really an issue. There are a few relics such as the Angelus before the news, I'm not sure how long this will last regardless of a UI but I can imagine it being got rid of at the behest of unionist politicians.

But what about RTÉ? What will it do to accomodate Protestant and British culture? Currently the north and especially protestants are completely ignored (e.g. no mention of the two Irish rowers who won medals at the Olympics because they competed for GB). What will change there? Imo, it should be changed now to accomodate them, but there's no sign of that happening anytime soon.

(Side note, protestant/unionist politicians might press in the Dáil [if they take their seats] for the removal of the last vestiges of pervasive Church influence, which would be good)

&gt; (What laws will change?) I'd say the fairly robust anti-discrimination Laws in the GFA would be enacted in the South, so the Direction of change would most likely be Laws coming from the north to the south rather than the other way about.

This is way more complicated than that, I imagine there will be a transition period for northerners to get used to new laws and for any necessary new laws to be passed in the south. There's loads of things like licensing laws, litter laws, taxes etc that would all be different but I can imagine a widespread publicity campaign happening during the transition. Same thing with road signage and traffic lights.

&gt; (Will there be snap elections to accomodate [ex]NI politicians?) Again Probably not given that the assembly would likely remain in place, for quite a while. It's an interesting question though about dissolving the Dáil and Something new replacing it, that's all up for debate.

I imagine there would be a new election at the end of the transition period, or at some agreed point to form the new Dáil. A bigger question is will unionists take their seats, I imagine they wouldn't, which would be of course counter-productive while important new laws are being passed.

&gt; (What about all the land and property the British Royal Family owns in NI? Will the Irish pay to take it back?) It will be brought into Public Ownership and no it will not be paid back.

Aye right, sure it will. The southerners will presumably just pay for it.

&gt; (British armed forces living in this new Ireland?) I can't see what the the Problem of them living here would be; The British and Irish Armed forces have joint operations and training all of the time.

All British soldiers would have to leave, the same as when the south got independence. Soldiers don't stay in foreign countries unless there's a war. I imagine some soldiers would switch to the Irish army, some would move the UK, some would retire.

&gt; (What about the Irish regiments of the British Army?) I'm sure new battalions would form; and Soldiers would be offered positions, if they so wish.

They would undoubtedly be disbanded and the soldiers could do what they wish.

Its why Lallana/Ibe/Hendo/Ings have played so much in pre-season. We are gearing them up for early fitness to hit the ground running and to build a good midfield partnership for Hendo-Milner.

Benteke should start as he has had a normal preseason already with AV and now us.

AI had a good podcast on this, looking at the training regime we are using and why some of our players played a lot of full 90's in the friendlies.

Rodgers needs a quick start to the campaign and to grind out points on the board.

Okay. Let's put this into perspective. The same sort of crimes occur within white communities. It's just called ""crimes of passion"". How many young men have picked fights because someone spilled their drinks? OR touched their ""bird"". Or looked at them funny? How many men who were being cheated on stabbed or attacked their loved ones. How many people have fought for revenge? Honour Crime is just a term used to describe crimes between tribes.

Now put this into perspective. 2700 Crimes in a population of around 210 million (Pakistan + Afghanistan). Which is around 3.5 times tht of the UK. Which means there would be 780 crimes of the sort in the UK if it was a honour culture. 

Can you honestly tell me that men and women haven't taken revenge for stupid bullshit, fought over spilt drinks and the like 780 times in a year in the UK? I bet I can find 780 cases of such bullshit on a weekend! 

The issue is that in Pakistan such violence is deadly because it  is a heavily armed society with little power to the police while we have a society where most such arguments end with torn shirts and black eyes and maybe thrown items. We do however have murders and the like that do occur because of this. However due to our policing of such crimes we try and prevent these. 

I don't think valuing family is bad. I think family is important and I am an atheist. I just come from an atheist background that is frankly unheard of. I don't know any other ex-Hindu atheists. We are rare and we don't get to write award winning books or stand on stages and talk. 

I do not think the Asian emphasis on family is a bad thing. What's bad is an unwillingness to see other viewpoints and a highly stratified power dynamic where women do not have power and men are expected to be dicks. In Pakistani families due to poverty there is less of an emphasis on education to boot which is what harms them. 

See the difference is? If my parents couldn't live by themselves I would ask them to move in with me (and the same applies to my fiancee's family). That's the difference in family which people don't get. Very few people from a Western background would do the same. It is rather weird to see family being held up as a weakness. The point of families is to realise that the traditional power structure is gone and it is more egalitarian.

&gt; There's loads of things like licensing laws, litter laws,

Most of these are local by-laws carried out by the local council basis both north and south, but licensing laws both north and south definitely need an overhaul.Taxes would Probably take a lot more time to harmonise.

&gt; But what about RTÉ? What will it do to accomodate Protestant and British culture? Currently the north and especially protestants are completely ignored (e.g. no mention of the two Irish rowers who won medals at the Olympics because they competed for GB). What will change there? Imo, it should be changed now to accomodate them, but there's no sign of that happening anytime soon.

I'm not sure about that; any shows i've seen on RTE or TG4 about the North are very evenly balanced, the BBC NI isn't exactly chockablock with loyalist culture as is. I'm sure RTE could cover the Twelfth! I'm not too sure about sport to be honest so i couldn't comment.

&gt; All British soldiers would have to leave, the same as when the south got independence. Soldiers don't stay in foreign countries unless there's a war. I imagine some soldiers would switch to the Irish army, some would move the UK, some would retire.

I don't think that would be the case even after the treaty was signed in 1921 [Britain held unto Ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Ports_%28Ireland%29) for military purposes well into the 1930's.

We need to send our B side to Romania. On paper we should still be able to beat them. If we manage to keep 11 on the pitch, we'll win. But if they don't, we'll all live. The Arsenal match is now the one that matters to me. We've got Sakho still fit, but to back him there's, well, it doesn't bear thinking about. I hope Bilic has an idea of what his first eleven will look like. Let's get ready for the Goon. Go and beat Astrid, but I hope we're getting ready fpr Arsenal.

null,false,obok,null,null,null,"**How do you think this season will go?**

I think this season will be fantastic. We've lost virtually no one this transfer window and added a few great players, particularly Ayew. We're spoiled for choice in midfield: Ayew, Montero, Shelvey, Ki, Sigurdsson and Cork are all fantastic players who deserve to start.  Routledge, Dyer, Grimes and Britton are pretty fucking great backups. Up front, I think Gomis will get loads of service and knock in 15+ goals. At the end of last season he showed that once he's settled and has some confidence he can really bang them in. The back four were solid and reliable last year and have been strengthened with the arrival of Tabanou. I think we can push for **6**. It's optimistic, but I think we're at that level now. It'll be very interesting to see how we do this year against Spurs, Liverpool and Southampton.                 

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?** 

Shelvey. He won us a bunch of points in the second half of last season, and he's looked brilliant in the preseason matches. I think this will be his breakout season. He has bags of talent and a chip on his shoulder.  

**How do you think the team will line up?** 

We have two different formations, but I expect the one we will use the most will be the classic Swansea 4-5-1, with the same back four as last year, Cork Shelvey Ki Ayew Montero in midfield, and Gomis up front. I think the diamond will be the same formation except with Sigurdsson instead of Montero.

~~Your point about Pakistan confuses me.~~(Edit, sorry my previous comment was unclear, have edited to improve) Pakistan may well be heavily armed, but we're in the U.K. and those figures are **reported** U.K. crime. Who knows how many have ""gone back home"" 

As you stated 11000 divided by 4 = 2750 per year and they are U.K. figs there's no need to adjust for population.

Now if you take out the overwhelming majority of people like yourself that don't commit these crimes you have a disturbing trend.

Like most crime it's safe to bet it's under reported. I'm not sure Khyber Pakhtunkhwa keep accurate figures. So I wouldn't dare to quote any for comparison, if we run it through your 3.5 figure we get 9625. Now when we have figures like 933 over two years **killed** I think there's an obvious culture clash. One that cannot be tolerated.

I'm sure there's a ton of spousal abuse up and down the country. I couldn't say how much was perpetrated by male relations of the victim like brothers, cousins and fathers then covered up by female relations. But the fact it's recorded as honour crime and not domestic means it has crossed lines of qualification, usually the person is a direct relation and the motivation is family honour.

Cresswell and Jenkinson are solid enough at full back, Hendrie looks decent (although he's injured now, typical) and O'Brien's moderate at best but we really should get a better one.

Link up play, yes. Certainly. Midfield (in the centre, not necessarily on the wings) is definitely our strongest area but we need to concentrate on signing another wing player to provide competition for Lanzini and Amalfitano because Jarvis isn't good backup. There's Valencia too depending on the formation.

But I'll say it again, we need a new striker. Sakho sadly gets injured sometimes, Valencia is inconsistent, Carroll might as well retire and Lee hasn't had the chance of develop because of that lazy twat Allardyce. Two would be nice, but I'm happy with at least one.

Re-engineering our roads is far cheaper (and more productive) then successfully changing the behaviour of an entire population.

We are never going to get to the level of cycling seen in the Netherlands - where &gt;30% use their bicycle as their main mode of transport - with some adverts and public appeals.

&gt;I don't accept that killing cyclists is inevitable any more than people owning hammers will inevitably lead to some people getting their brains smashed in, so why punish those who do it?

If you ever read this blog or related blogs you'll note that the weak (or non existent) punishments for drivers that kill cyclists through their dangerous driving is a frequent topic. But even if we had a robust system of justice for careless driving, it wouldn't get people cycling.

People are *always* going to make mistakes, whether cycling or driving. It's human nature. A good system allows some forgiveness for these mistakes by not making them so fatal.

If we really wanted to, we could reduce the levels of motoring in our country by half, get half of us cycling, that's less expense on buying and insuring these machines that for most of the day are sat silent occupying enormous amounts of space, less expense spared on maintaining the road network, our children would be able to play in our streets and we could all navigate our cities without being forced to buy a car ourselves - because the ubiquity of the motor car does force us all into adopting it. Forget self driving or electric cars, this would be an even greater revolution. We would all be happier and healthier for it.

I honestly can't believe that on a 250 you are looking at £10,000 a year. Even with the whole liability thing. My first lot of insurance for my 125 was around £500. I have been riding for 3 years and my current insurance (third party, fire and theft) is £19.21 a month. On the 6th of August I will be swapping insurance from my 125 over to my new 500 (fingers crossed i'll have passed my A2 on the 5th). The cheapest quote I found for this was, again third party, fire and theft, with 3 years no claims £400-500. I appreciate that you have a claim against you but how can I get a 500cc bike insured for a fraction of what you have been quoted for a 250cc. My bike is also worth £4300.

You need to go somewhere else and fast. http://www.mcncompare.com/?refid=GPPC-MCN-COM-e-c-1t1&amp;gclid=CIv6h4ftg8cCFYvpwgodnkYH6w
Follow that link and see what quotes you get from the different companies. I'm with Bennetts currently, but I was with MCE for my first 2 years of riding.

Please keep us updated with what happens, but that is seriously scary what you are being quoted.

He isn't a bigot though. He most certainly does not respect certain views. He tolerates them however.

&gt;*and adulation based on attacking religion*

He isn't adulated (if that's a form of the word) for attacking religion. He's admired for not being a PC dipshit and for recognising that certain groups hold certain demographics based off of certain socioeconomic implications. He's the type that isn't afraid of criticising a community when it holds certain, subjective, problems. He is also praised for sharing his views with out giving a flying fudge for sensitivity in which sensitivity, in itself, is a form of self censorship. He's praised for honesty and bluntness in his opinions and for opposing the *that*dismissive ignorance in which I don't believe he's a part of. I surely disagree with most of his views. I'm not a vegan, I'm not repulsed by religion and I'm not so pro Israel in the Gaza conflict. Though I don't think I'm eligible to comment there. That doesn't mean I find him ""isolated"" though. He just holds very different values in which he measures others by. He may be *a little* vicious at times.

&gt;*and credentials of once being a comedian.*

No one, in my experience, has ever considered that part of him when sharing a judgement.

&gt;*He wants to use free speech to shut it down.*

How so?

I'm going to call that a complete load of bull. He has always advocated it and has never, in my experience, tried to shut it down. He often comments using that very language and has stated that he and we tolerate, despite disliking, such exploits.

He may hate what you say, but has always defended your right to say it. Unlike many.

&gt;*I'm not sure about you either.*

:S

Not really appreciated.

Of course this is subject to bias, but I consider myself to be by very definition liberal and I believe that I am among the least bigoted, prejudiced or hating person I've seen. I suppose me defending Pat makes it understandable. I think he's often misunderstood.

Assuming everyone stays healthy, we look great with anyone pairing up with something like a Kompany/Mangala pairing, with Denayer getting spot starts. That would make Stones a much more curious buy because even if Demi retires after this season, you wouldn't be able to get both Denayer AND Stones on the pitch at the same time very often. I think this would be counterproductive toward their growth, and maybe not a situation that either of them would be fond of.

Which gets me thinking about Kompany. Ever since he played in a career-high 50 games in 2010, his appearances have steadily declined. 42 in 2011-12, 37 in 2012-13 and 2013-14, 31 in 2014-15.

The dudes on the fake sites are all from China or Thailand. Just because they sell fakes doesn't mean they are shitty people. I ordered a kit last season that was out of stock.

The first is to ignore it for another 4 years, at which point the debt will become statute barred and you pay none of the debt with them unable to enforce it, but this requires putting up with being chased for four years and throwing away the letters.

The second option is to save up enough to offer them a settlement figure. It is not uncommon to have them accept as little as 60%, and the closer you get to the magic 6 year figure the lower that percentage can be. I have seen as low as 15% towards the end.

Option three is to repay it at a rate that is affordable, you can find lots of excellent advice on the consumer action group website, but essentially what you need to do it put together a finanical statement showing your income and expenditure, use one of the template letters on that website and make an offer of whatever is left after you have paid all of your priority accounts and essential expenses.

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"&gt; I generally like Tomkins' work but I feel like any list that puts Heskey's value at 40m+ or Reyes' value at nearly 60m is either wrong, or doesn't provide any useful information.

Why exactly? £11m was a fairly massive amount when we paid it - at the time it was a new transfer record for the club (as £40m would be today, by a similar percentage margin too). Just because he didn't play like you'd expect a £40m striker to today doesn't mean that it wasn't the sort of figure the club valued him at when we signed him. 

This is a historical list of transfers, meaning it's inherently going to be tainted by hindsight and whether you'd really expect to pay that much money today for a player that has now had the career we know they had. 

There doesn't necessarily have to be a point to be made, it can just be food for thought. I think it's an interesting set of numbers to look at, at the very least as a rough historical spending history for clubs throughout the PL era. It's not perfect, and no simple mathematical equation ever will be for something like this, but it's not like Tomkins is really claiming anything otherwise.

I have dumped close to 10 years worth of photos (4TB of RAW photos) onto it so far. House can now burn down and I don't have to run into the flames and grab backup drives

&gt;**Music Streaming** (this week) - granted a fraction of the amount of stuff Spotify has but it is a good start. Any fairly mainstream artists you are after they probably have 

&gt;**TV/FILM Streaming** - a few things Netflix doesn't have. Most of my viewing stays with Netflix but Amazon is fantastic for Kids. Their Kids selection blows Netflix out of the water. (Obviously only a plus if you have kids or just love my little pony).

&gt;**1 free Kindle book** a month to *own* from their new authors selection (basically they give you a choice of 3/4 books each month of promoted new authors and it yours - bit hit and miss). **1 free book to *hire*** from Kindle Unlimited a month - much broader selection and a lot of it is crap but there is some gold in there if you look.

&gt;However ... what has been awesome is the **""free digital credit""** they offer. They don't advertise this but basically they have shot themselves in the foot with ""free next delivery"" and needed to encourage people to stagger deliveries. They do this by offering £1 free digital credit if you go for 5 day delivery. It adds up fairly quickly if you order a lot. 

&gt;I would suggest **tracking discounts and searching for reduction** rather than trusting the lighting deals (which are normally just clearing shite). 
I tend to rely heavily on uk.camelcamelcamel.com to create wishlists and track basic household stuff. i.e. if 1kg of coffee drops to £7 it alerts me and I buy it. This has saved me a fortune over the last few years. 
Equally there are a fair few ""deal finder"" sites that will allow you construct a search term for items with 50%+ discounts. I have found this really useful to for any big purchases (i.e. on electronics you can see really big price drops from time to time like [this](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/HP-712328-031-ProLiant-Performance-Server/product/B00DPT536Y?active=price_amazon) or [this](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/Sapphire-FIREPRO-S9000-Server-Graphics/product/B00H27HQUG?active=price_amazon)). 

&gt;So (at the risk of sounding like an Amazon shill) if you use any of the above in combination it is totally worth it. If you just purchase it for one thing of the above probably not. 

As someone that has bought such a lot of shit from Amazon in the past this is very helpful,  I think I am just looking for a decent video streaming service especially with regards to anime and Netflix blows instant out in that regard.

1. We'll still be damaged by the two-three year period with Corbyn in power.

2. If he stands down and there isn't a left candidate on the ballot there will be fallout from the Corbynites.

People seem to think those two are exciting future prospects, why waste them on 2020 when, if we gain seats but not a majority (likely at the moment) they could build on the momentum of a successful Cooper leadership for 2025? It's probably a better prospect than expecting they could turn things around for us and get us a majority in 2020 after three years of Corbyn.

Hence why people invest in it in the first place and it's often deemed safer than a bank.

As for why should Germany etc. take more...well the UK opted out of Schengen because it wanted to control it's own borders and has always maintained it would do so. Schengen has left Europe in a situation where containing illegal migrants at the entry point is impossible due to open border policies, its not fair the UK should in anyway suffer for that.

If a migrant moves to London, amongst people from his home country and others of different non British nationalities, how can he be expected to learn, adapt and succeed without exposure to English people. Where are all the English? Moving to the coast and South Derbyshire. It would be like me moving to Spain, never mixing with Spanish people, watching fools and horses on t.v. and eating egg and chips. How could I ever expect to be accepted as Spanish? Or living at the United Nations and saying I was American even though I'd never stepped out of Manhattan.

Now it doesn't matter if the immigrant is from Eritrea, Syria or America. If he's living with people with similar background he's going to struggle to even know what British is.  That may not matter to the American if they have money but someone that came here for a better life is limited from getting better employment, education and oportunities and remain an alien/outsider in the midst of an effectively foreign country.

People have asked what I mean by British, I suspect they'd like me to say white. If you look at my other replies in my comment history you can find out if I'm a Nazi or not, all that stuff pretty easily to find as its all fresh.

Now if that's answered your question, how about you answer mine.

Complete rubbish you terrorist apologist. Look at this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_political_violence#Notable_attacks and educate yourself on the extent of the violence Palestinians and pro-Palestine terrorists have used.

I clicked on 3 random attacks and found these:

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizengoff_Street_bus_bombing - a suicide attack on a civilian bus killing 22 and injuring 50

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_massacre - A suicide bombing which killed 30 innocents and injured 140

3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport_massacre - Japanese terrorists recruited by a Palestinian terror organisation attacked an Israeli airport and killed 26 and wounded 80.

I haven't cherry picked these at all I clicked on 3 random ones.

 Hey, not to the man mind, you may well be smarter than me. I didn't always feel this way. It was actually a black friend of mine (who just got his PhD) who first got me thinking and is sort of ashamed of 60% of his race and argued that black people were less intelligent.

I also believe that black people on average are stronger and faster than every other race. It makes for good football players so of course I fucking love mané. Would I want him taking an IQ test to save my life? Probably not. Do I want him playing football for my absolute favourite football team? Absolutely. Same goes for big vic.

And about why I don't make these opinions public? I'm scared too.

While I agree that you should be allowed to just insert money or a card and it does the final calculation, some people like to see what the total will be before they pick their payment method. Having a finish button of some kind lets you see the total after discounts, etc. But I agree that it should be optional. (I believe it is already optional in Tesco)

&gt; The default 'ready' screen shouldn't require any user input other than swiping your first item. The screen should simply say ""Start swiping to begin"" or something.

Again, in Tesco at least (and I think most supermarkets), you can just start scanning. The button press is optional. 

&gt; If an age restricted item is scanned, it shouldn't lock you out of scanning other items. It should highlight (by means of something more obvious than a feeble little red LED above your checkout) that you need attention, and let you swipe the rest of the items while the assistant walks over.

Yup. I agree completely on this one. 

&gt; The screen's UI itself needs a big dose of skeuomorphism. Why not graphically show the items you've bought being dropped into a representation of the Bagging Area with some decent pictorial representations of the items.

...Why? I'm to busy looking for the next item or putting items in the bag to care whats going on on the screen.

&gt; This should all be smoothly animated, with zero lag and with actual human-readable product names (ideally in the font style of the brand/logo), not HEINZ 4PK BEANS&amp;SAUS or SP TOMATO SA.

While it would be nice, smooth animations are hardly required for adding something to a list. Zero lag would be nice in an ideal world though. But yes, there is no reason not to have more human readable names.

&gt; There's too much going on material-design wise with the current checkout construction. Too many different materials; chrome weighing scale/scanner area, light plastic laser case, dark plastic screen bezel, all with loads of gaps and lines around the place. It's too busy for the eye and it doesn't lend any hints to the natural progression of purchasing items.

Would you prefer everything to be stainless steel? That's the only material that could be used everywhere. It would look ridiculous. Obviously each supermarket wants their own branding in there somehow.

It's gotta be Mané for me, towards the end of the season he was really showing his quality, after he stopped going down at everything, he was incredible, we have him for a full season this year, no work permit or AFCON to worry about, he'll have Bertrand/Soares/JRod/Tadic feeding him like he's starving, it's going to be great to watch.

[As for my lineup] (http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=86j1) it's hard to just have him here and sub here, our front 3 AM's for example, can all play pretty much in each of those positions, left, right and center, the likelyhood is, we'll see one of them there before we'll see Isgrove as the first replacement for example, same goes for DM's and Reed. Cuco can play anywhere across the back so is good backup cover for all really, and I think Gazza/K. Davis will rotate between 2nd and 3rd choice.

Or maybe he has stocks in a VPN service...

God this is painful.

&gt;David Cameron has demanded that porn websites introduce strict age checks or face being shut down.

If he actually means shut down instead of blocked he's shown himself to be an even bigger moron than I already thought he was, we do have some porn production in this country but it's not even close to the majority, his power over these websites, much like his approval ratings should this go through, is nil.

&gt;One option is to set up an independent regulator which could force internet service providers (ISPs) to block offending sites under the threat of fines.

Possible, trivial to bypass.

&gt;Mr Cameron proposed that websites ask for bank details or credit card details instead.

...because that's fucking fool proof when you're trying to stop people who actually *want* to watch porn (yes, your 14 year old son *does* want to watch some German nasties) and have access to your personal belongings.  This still runs into the problem that Dave has no power at all outside of this country.

&gt;""Our one nation government is working hard to make the internet a safer place for children,"" he said.

Our one nation government is working hard to make it look like we are doing something when we actually have no fucking clue how any of this works, actually we're just wasting your money and pissing you off, OOPS!

&gt;""I want to see age restrictions put into place or these websites will face being shut down.""

No they won't.

&gt;In recent months ISPs including Sky have introduced filters blocking adult content, meaning users have to opt-out to view explicit content.

&gt;Internet security minister Baroness Joanna Shields said: ""As a result of our work with industry, more than 90% of UK consumers are offered the choice to easily configure their internet service through family friendly filters.

Right, okay, I can understand this, I think it should have been opt *in* but nevermind, it's mostly unobtrusive, how about instead of trying to do something that *will*. *not*. *work* you pump some money into researching these (fucking useless) filters, that would probably have a greater chance of success.

&gt;""Whilst great progress has been made, we remain acutely aware of the risks and dangers that young people face online.""

ARGH. Yes, there are dangers to young people on the internet, it's not watching porn though, it's becoming the damned stuff, if you *actually* want to make children safer on the internet then put all the wasted cash you want to dump into this and put it toward catching groomers.

The man is an imbecile.

I think everyone agrees its ridiculous to blame people for the mistakes of the past. If we do then we have a lot of apologising to do for violences carried out much more recently than the monarchies acts of violence. Dresden rings a bell. 

According to the independent you pay [56p](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cost-of-royal-family-rises-twice-as-fast-as-inflation-9563293.html) a year to the Royal family. So not that much really. That money goes towards lots of things such as travel expenses for the diplomatic work they do and also I imagine employs a lot of people. 

The Queen is also very upfront about her expenses and publishes a financial report yearly so people can look it at online [here](http://www.royal.gov.uk/theroyalhousehold/royalfinances/overview.aspx). Do our elected officials do so? I think the real people who are stealing money from the tax payers seem to be the elected officials by claiming more than they should on their expenses. The Queen pays tax voluntarily too, she is technically tax exempt. 

Do I want a fairer distribution of wealth? Yes, that sounds nice. But I feel like I would rather start with football players who do far less for the money they are paid. Or people like Rupert Murdoch, or people and companies who hide their money in banks abroad to avoid paying the correct amount of tax. Then maybe I will look at the royal family and think they aren't worth it, right now I would be less embarrassed to have the Queen meet foreign word leaders than our politicians though.

Yes, I think general anti-Jewish sentiment is rising in the United Kingdom amongst all groups, but Jews only have themselves (actions in Palestine, extreme over representation in halls of power) to blame for that. However most actual British people (British as in their blood not their passport which means fuck all) aren't barbaric enough to attack someone.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

We have a number of game changers in midfield and attack, but our star, like others have said, will continue to be our Captain Ashley Williams. His contributions, both in defense and in leadership are immeasurable, and consistency from him will be crucial to finishing high.
