So called austerity does not take money out of the economy. The government does not have money of its own. To spend money they must first take money out of the economy. Then they waste a pile of it with admin and bureaucracy. Once they are done they spend what's left over on things people don't really want in an inefficient manner.

It's like a doctor with a patient that has lost a lot of blood. So he takes blood out of the patient and  puts it back in again. If you point out the stupidity of this he says 'But without a transfusion the patient will die!'

At the moment the British state is so enormous it spends more than one pound in three that is spend in the economy. Just think about that for a minute. Every time anyone in the country buys anything the state is spending more than one pound for every two they spend. Fill your car up with petrol, the state spends half that amount. Go shopping, the state spends half that amount of money. Buy a house, the state spends half that amount of money. 

The state is a huge, profligate monstrosity that consumes everything it can get it's rotten, yellow fangs into.

What you should have said is immigration isn't much of a problem for those it doesn't negatively effect, because we now have a society of 'I'm all right Jack'. One that despises it's own working classes.

The main attraction for me was that it was relatively cheap (I paid £10; look out for promotional codes etc. that CitizenCard post on FB), and was a speedier application than a driving licence.

I now have a provisional and passport, and tbh I'd recommend getting a provisional. Even if you don't want to drive, you'll end up wanting or needing to get one at some stage anyway. When I did some casual work over the holiday period, my employer wouldn't accept my CitizenCard and I had to bring in my birth cert., a utility bill, my NI letter, and something else ""official"", whereas if I'd had a provisional that's all they needed.

Surely it's all relative, and comparing 310,000 in 12 months in the 21st century to 10,000,000 in the 19th is more than a little disingenuous when you consider broader socio-economic influences in each period, specifically the population densities of the USA at that time at Britain today.

If we stop using deflective percentage figures as if they mean something (because this isn't a purely academic exercise; at the end of the day we're talking about policies which shape the lives of people, not numbers on a spreadsheet) and actually look at the real numbers, I think any body with a shred of sense would see that 310,000 pa. is in fact mass immigration and unsustainable at that.

3,100,000 over the course of a decade (because let's be real here - construction and infrastructure take years to come to fruition so let's not pretend that immigration will stop dead while we try and catch up with things) is another Manchester. And you think that's a good idea?

Bearing in mind that infrastructure and construction projects take years to come to fruition:

* How many houses would we need to build a year for that, just to maintain housing prices (to say nothing of the need to build more to satisfy current demand)?
* How much public spending is that?
* How many schools do we need to build to teach the children of an extra 3 million people? How many hospitals?
* How many doctors and nurses do we need to import?
* How many roads do we need to build?
* How many railways?
* How much more food do we need to have floating along the shipping lanes?
* How much more energy do we need to generate?
* And crucially, where do we put them? Physically?

Let's say you're given £1 trillion because you're ideologically the best man to spearhead such ideology. Where are you going to build all the infrastructure for another 3 million people over the next 10 years? The Pennines? The Grampians? Pack them into the South East because everyone wants a piece of London, and that's where people are congregating naturally anyway?

Or are you braindead enough to think that the immigration figures will just kind of tail off naturally by some kind of mystical divine providence?",null,0,null,1433836722,null,0,false,0,cs0drjb,null,t3_3919vp,null,t1_cs0drjb,null,t1_crzyq8c,null,null,null,1436842759,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

I deliberately inflated the numbers). That will drop even further when they introduce whatever new safety measures they come up with.

My maths, if you're interested:

(Copied straight from an FB comment)

The Smiler has been open over 2 years, so if we'll call it 700 operational days, to account for closures, etc.

It takes 2'45 to ride it and 16 people fit in a carriage. The park is open 9 hours a day. So, if we use the figure of 7 hours a day (to be conservative), that's 420 minutes a day and at 165 seconds per ride, that gives ~150 rides per day.

(150x16)x700 = 1,680,000. So that's our (very conservative) estimate for the number of people who have ridden The Smiler.

In the history of the ride, I think it's fair to say that less than 10 people have been injured, but let's say 20 people.

That means your chance of getting injured on The Smiler is less than 0.001%.

I would say it's actually much, much lower than that. It is certainly shit that people got injured and it certainly shouldn't have happened but I wouldn't let it put you off roller coasters.

My problems are two-fold. 

- First, my experience is that animal charities, and particularly small, independent charities, were far more likely to have poor governance, technical breaches of the law or best practice, attract complaints and have internal disputes. They were also far more likely to ignore advice or direction, because, The Cats! As a regulator advising on good governance or best practice, they were amongst the hardest organisations to work with. To sum up: Unprofessional. 

- As for the larger organisations - they do, of course, tend to be more professional, but I have more of a personal moral objection. To give a flavour using figures from a few years ago: A famous donkey charity had enough money to send every donkey in its care to Eton. It alone received more money than every abused women's charity on the Register of Charities. A famous dog's home had two years worth of operating money in the bank and no idea how to spend it, but still ran emotive nationwide campaigns asking for more money. I don't like it. 

RSPCA, at a national level, has had some problems. I have had little personal contact with the charity or its branches, but former colleagues have. My understanding is that the branches can be well run, but head office not so much.

Again, let me stress... these are personal views, based in some cases on old information, and definitely not the view of the British government.

null,false,MyCodeSucks,null,null,null,"Well, here is a timeline of our course:

Year 10, Autumn: Great computer science teacher who actualoly knows what she was talking about, we learnt about how to do our coursework and did a practise task. Then for some reason she left after 4 weeks.

Year 10, Spring: We have a cover person who is really nice, but this leads to us getting no work done.

Year 10, Summer: By this time I have realized that we are going to need to teach ourselves, so I start my coursework while everyone else continues to to nothing.

Year 11, Autumn: A year has now passed, some people in my class have done about 4 weeks of work in the entire year, while I have done part of my first coursework. We now have an ICT teacher, not a computer science teacher. Mock exams come around, I somehow managed to get an A* just by reading through the book, not everyone was so fortunate.

Year 11, Spring: I have now started my second piece of coursework, again, little help from the teacher. In fact, I spent lots of time just helping my friends, including writing entire scripts for them to use...

Year 11, Summer: Thanks to revision sessions with other subjects, we lost most of our computer science lessons. Thankfully I was able to complete both pieces of coursework at school after school, but some people ran out of time.

So to sum up, our class had no teacher for a year, then we had a non-computing teacher for another year. We learnt no theory in lessons, and in order to finish pieces of coursework we had to come in after school. :(",null,0,null,1433837801,null,0,false,0,cs0e0v5,null,t3_394wqk,null,t1_cs0e0v5,null,t3_394wqk,null,null,null,1436842993,null,5,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,5,null

If I were a landlord, with a mortgage, I would absolutely charge more than the mortgage or I would make a loss. But, in spite of this, the rent for a property is still *not directly linked* to the total mortgage value of a property. If a landlord purchases a building outright they can afford to lease at a much lower rate than the going mortgage for the same property. Even with a mortgage in place larger (corporate) landlords may consider renting at below that rate if the long term investment is deemed worth it - i.e. to end up with a valuable property.

The rental value of properties is set by simple supply/demand. If a million new rental homes come onto the market in a city, the rental price will fall - landlord mortgages be damned. That would of course be unsustainable, most would go out of business &amp; sell up, and the number of available rental properties would fall until real actual costs are again balanced with actual income. If the majority of landlords in the area are private landlords with mortgages, this value will be above that mortgage threshold. If the majority of landlords in the area are corporate landlords with no mortgages, that value may be much lower.

&gt;  Meaning of “psychoactive substance” etc

&gt;(1) In this Act “psychoactive substance” means any substance which—

&gt;(a)
is capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes
it, and

&gt;(b) is not an exempted substance.

&gt;(2) For the purposes of this Act a substance produces a psychoactive effect in a
person if, by stimulating or depressing the person’s central nervous system, it affects the person’s mental functioning or emotional state; and references to a
substance’s psychoactive effects are to be read accordingly.

&gt;(3) For the purposes of this Act a person consumes a substance if the person causes
or allows the substance, or fumes given off by the substance, to enter the
person’s body in any way. 

Before you ask (and it's a reasonable thought), [glue does not appear in the list of exempted substances in schedule 1](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0002/lbill_2015-20160002_en_5.htm#sch1).

You should only really use the rear brake at slow speeds say 15mph or less. As being a new rider, if you need to emergency stop and slam on the rear brake because you're foot is hovered over it, you'll most likely lock the back wheel up and fall.

It's difficult because you're not use to it, simple as. Motorcycle boots may or may not help that, as like everyone else here, can probably ride in motorcycle boots, trainers, sandals even bare feet, and still change gear and brake effectively, maybe not bare feet, but you get the idea.

My advice would be to get a pair of motorcycle boots, doesn't have to be top of the line, but I'd suggest you get a waterproof pair, as they'll come in handy dowm theblone with the unpredictable British Weather and just do your DAS, you'll get more comfortable and pick it up and before you knowing you change gears and brake naturally.

The rest of the world has moved on and found quicker, more intuitive ways to consume that information.

psychoactive effects. 


It is an offense to produce or supply any psychoactive substance if that substance is likely to be consumed for its psychoactive effect. Glue definitely fits that description, it's well documented that a number of people who buy it intend to consume it for its psychoactive effect.  Whether they intend to enforce it is another matter, but there's no ambiguity in the fact that glue would definitely be illegal to sell in some instances, and is of ambiguous legality at best in others - what actions are necessary to not be seen as ""recklessly"" selling glue? Do you need proof of what they plan to do with it and who they intend to supply it on to?

Then there are slightly bigger questions (4 marks) which ask about the language features the author uses, like an English Literature paper. You need to comment on style of writing such as metaphors, smilies, alliteration etc... Finally you have your 8 and 10 mark question which you should spend a decent amount of time on. On the 8 mark you will be asked to write about the story as a whole about how the author shows something. You DO NOT need to quote in latin for this part, and it is better not to in case you get it wrong. Make sure to refer to the whole story, not just given passages.

Instead, there is an impulse to clamp down on any activity deemed to be undesirable. The desire to control, to impose a puritanical outlook on all of us, comes first. The fact that, in certain situations, there is evidence of actual harm from a particular activity is obviously a powerful argument for not doing it, which has provided excellent camouflage for the little Hitlers in the public-health lobby. However, when these zealots try to ban something for which there is no evidence of harm, it makes it abundantly clear what their true motivations are.

 - Any social charges and/or taxes paid on salaries;
 - Accommodation expenses;
 - Tuition fees and costs incurred in providing internal or external academic education programmes;
 - Travel costs incurred in connection with the players’ education Training camps;

 - Travel costs for training, matches, competitions and tournaments;

 - Expenses incurred for use of facilities for training including playing fields, gymnasiums, changing rooms etc. (including depreciation costs);

 - Costs of providing a football kit and equipment (e.g. balls, shirts, goals etc.);

 - Expenses incurred in playing competitive matches including referees expenses, and competition registration fees;
Salaries of coaches, medical staff, nutritionists and other professionals;
 - Medical equipment and supplies;

 - Expenses incurred by volunteers;

 - Other miscellaneous administrative costs (a percentage % of central overheads to cover administration cost accounting, secretarial services etc.)

The only other factor is the 'tier' of the club, and since both are professional clubs, both will be considered tier 1 (championship sides are still considered to have tier 1 professional training).

So yeah, from what I've read up on it, Spurs doing this means jack shit. They just wanted to talk to him first but lost out even with that.

The one that jumped out at me was ""Schlosser"" claiming that Oxford ""cancelled an abortion debate"" last year.

Of course, it didn't. Some pro-life student group wanted to host a ""debate"" about how terrible abortion is, between two men, and one of the colleges refused to host them. They're not required to facilitate political showboating. This wasn't about academia, or intellectual questioning, it was about propaganda.

If they're prepared to misrepresent events in the UK like this, it makes me strongly doubt the legitimacy of some of their other examples. Another of the articles singles out an ""artist"" (not an academic, somebody with frankly almost zero clout) and claims she ""literally said science is racist"". Except glancing at the tweets in question (yeah, tweets - that's how rigorous this is), she ""literally"" says nothing of the sort - she's not talking about science in general, but about evolutionary psychology in particular. And lots and lots of evo psych (indeed arguably all of it - I'd personally make an exception for some but not all very prestigious academics but I can see why someone wouldn't) is bollocksology of the highest order. She's not saying ""all science is racist"" she's saying ""evolutionary psychology is racist, and this racist thinking has affected lots of other scientific disciplines too"".

It's not very well sourced, but it's a fucking Tweet to be fair.

Some might say that her point of view is the very ""dangerous idea"" we ought to be encouraging.

&gt;(2)For the purposes of this Act a substance produces a psychoactive effect in a person if, by stimulating or depressing the person’s central nervous system, it affects the person’s mental functioning or emotional state; and references to a substance’s psychoactive effects are to be read accordingly.
(3)For the purposes of this Act a person consumes a substance if the person causes 
or allows the substance, or fumes given off by the substance, to enter the 
person’s body in any way.

That's not the definition of a Psychoactive Substance in this act. See, *consume*. Psychoactive substance as *legal definition* would have nothing to do with as a literal definition.

It has nothing to do with sight, if something is huffing perfume fumes for the solvent then it still wouldn't be illegal unless it was reasonable for the shopkeeper to assume this was the case. Which, no court would hold up - especially because it would involve prosecuting normal businesses (which is entirely outside of the state's interest.)

Words have every day uses and the legal uses summarised in a bill, specifically so it only affects the things they intend it to and not act as a catch all for literally every known substance. It is not ""psychoactive"" and ""substance"" like the words in a dictionary. It is ""Psychoactive Substance"" exactly how it is defined in the bill.

I've lost jobs to redundancy in the past, I have income protection insurance and a couple of months savings for this very reason.

The only thing I'm at risk of is long term (over 12m) sickness or disability that renders me unable to work.

I'm a motorcyclist, which presents a comparatively high risk of death or serious injury. I'll leave out the death scenario as it doesn't really matter if I snuff it, although I do have life insurance (work benefit) so my Fiancee would be ok.

Less serious injuries such as loss of a limb could happen, and, if the accident were my own fault, I might only get £10,000 from the personal injury cover on my bike insurance. Obviously if it were not my fault I'd stand to gain much more in compensation from the other insurer or the motor insurers bureau.

While I've done field work etc previously, I'm now in an office at a screen all day. Loss of a limb wouldn't stop me working.

It's possible a bike accident could cause a spinal injury and lead to paralysis, and that the accident could be my fault. that's probably the most likely scenario in which I'd have to give up work.

So it would have to be pretty bad for me to be unable to continue working, but it is a risk. That said, I think the level of risk is pretty low and managed as well as it can be.

Half the arguments against Monsanto are 'farmers can't keep seeds', that's not Monsanto's fault, that's the actual law regarding GMO's. 

Exactly the same thing happens if you grow a Pink Lady Apple tree, you cannot grow more unless you get the rights to breed more. If you do, you will get aggressively sued by the breeder. Same goes for a lot of non-GMO crops, but you don't hear about this as GMO's are the big nasty creature, and not the creature that has created things such as Golden Rice that has helped prevent blindness.

Seems at odds with your position that they didn't cancel the debate, but whatever.

&gt;Another of the articles singles out an ""artist"" (not an academic, somebody with frankly almost zero clout) and claims she ""literally said science is racist"". 

Uh, what's that got to do with this piece?  Why the rant about what someone apparently wrote in another article?  And which article are you referring to anyway?  

Edit:  Near instant downvote.  Of course.  

Edit II:  Wow.

I think that describing these circumstances as ""Oxford university cancels debate"" is misleading.

They aren't required to host meetings like that. They don't host debates about flat earth theory or young earth creationism. They do *occasionally* have debates about evolution/intelligent design, but they are careful to make sure they have actual academics promoting science.

They'd be well within their rights to ""cancel"" a fundamentalist Christian ""debate"" about evolution that only featured the likes of Ken Ham.

Edit:  And [here's the text](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/why-i-am-pro-choice/16221#.VXbJDio-f0c) of the planned speech from Brendan O'Neill.  You compared this debate to allowing Young Earth Creationists speak, but perhaps people should judge for themselves.

Excerpt:

&gt;**Why I am pro-choice**

&gt;That is what we’ve been invited here tonight to talk about: ‘abortion culture’. I’ve been asked to oppose the motion ‘This House Believes Britain’s Abortion Culture Hurts Us All’. The reason I’m happy to oppose this motion is because it is built on a fallacy. There is no ‘abortion culture’. There are abortions. And there are women who have abortions. But there isn’t an ‘abortion culture’. And how can we be harmed by something which doesn’t exist?
The promotional blurb for tonight’s debate tells us that 185,000 abortions were carried out in Britain last year, and apparently this is evidence of an ‘abortion culture’, that a powerful and negative culture is pressuring or conditioning women to ‘treat human life carelessly’. Well, 160,000 hip-replacement procedures were carried out last year, too. Why do we not talk about a ‘hip-replacement culture’? There were 60,000 hysterectomies. Why do we not speak of a ‘hysterectomy culture’? It’s because no one wants to ratchet up fear about those medical procedures, so the c-word isn’t necessary. But there are many who want us to view abortion with dread, to see it not simply as a medical procedure that some women choose but as a product of a culture of death and carelessness, which clueless women have apparently been pressured or conditioned to embrace. And so they add the menacing culture tag.

Was that rhetoric too dangerous for the sensitive ears of frail Oxford students?  Was it equivalent to letting a Young Earth Creationist speak?

Edit: And looking at this article - here are the tweets which the writer was referring to:

&gt;most ""scientific thought"" as u know it isnt that scientific but shaped by white patriarchal bias of ppl who claimed authority on it.

Seems to me that the tweeter really was dismissing science as racist.  The second tweet refers to 'most scientific thought' - i.e. not just evolutionary psychology.

Arousing the person because it smells, is distinct to a stimulating response to the central nervous system. Normally, the smell comes from an ester (like octyl acetate) mixed with a solvent, which is not usually a depressant or stimulant (but it depends on precisely which one you're using.)

We have 3 Abu Dhabi based sponsors. Etihad, Etisalat and Aabar.

Those deals were signed in 2009,2010 and 2011.

SO by the same methodology that you just posted, when those deals were struck and accounted for (in full, for their total worth over the course of the contracts) in the BrandFinance football rankings, we had a value of $302m and were ranked 21st.


Today, 2015 we have a value of $800m, which represents a growth of  $500m without a single further Abu Dhabi based sponsorship, so no, that is not why we are fourth.

I could then go on to prove how those sponsorships are not overinflated, but what would be the point? You're wrong. 

Enjoy watching your club continue to slip into mediocrity while you become the next Spurs, desperately trying to break into the top four whilst reminiscing about the 80s. You should have made the most of your position at the top instead of wasting it.

To begin with, the economic benefits are likely overstated:
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/tpp-at-the-nabe/?_r=0

The final article you link was referring to the announcement of TTIP, which is hardly a valid argument in the context of today as it had nothing to work from other than an ideal.  Note also, that the gist of the headline (again, sorry that I can't read the article) is that business should get behind these agreements.  I don't think that is really under contention - particularly given that business lobbyists are able to have their voice heard in the negotiations and have well-oiled gears for political access and influence.

Again - people aren't necessarily opposing the notion of trade agreements entirely, they are looking at very specific elements of these agreements that are over-reaching and open for abuse.  At the negotiation phase, it's vital to voice these concerns to ensure that adequate protections are put in.

Finally, it's important for citizens to become involved in the political process.  It's the basis of a legitimate democracy.  Just because most of us can't speak the complicated languages of international trade law doesn't mean that our opinions should be dismissed entirely.  If nothing else, the negotiators are doing a very bad job of articulating the process and reasoning behind the elements that the public are latching onto.

Again, it's worth considering these aspects (which are NOT just blogspam, come on - I've just linked here a Nobel Prize winner, an established political party, and an elected MEP) and delving deeper.

However, changes already start getting made, remove those who Rodgers installed at the club, Pascoe, Marsh etc and replace them with people with stature in the game who will help the transition once Rodgers leaves. Klopp arrives in time for a January transfer window after watching Liverpool all season. Fans aren't expecting a miracle (should we need it) as he's working with Rodgers' current team which gives him half a season to figure out what he needs/wants in the next summer transfer window. Sterling signs new contract now that Rodgers is gone. Fans are happy and we make a push for top 4 in 2016/2017 season.

The laughable rumours doing the rounds like Tevez and Ibrahimovic not a hope they will come to us unless we pay them massive wages which FSG wont do. To do well and get top 4 we need players on real form like we did with Suarez and Sturridge. 

Our spine of the team is not very strong which you need to compete. We have an average to good goal keeper. Our center backs arent top great.  Skrtel is solid but not outstanding, Sakho I like but injury prone, Toure is backup and Lovern is Lovern. Center midfield we are solid and have the genius of Coutinho.  Striker is our main worry.  Our most dependable is Sturridge who is made of glass. In my view we have a World Class talent in Ballotelli but is a complete enigma. Ings I think will suit us and Origi who I will be honest only have seen a little bit so I am unsure. I have left sterling out as for me hes more winger and we are looking at the spine.

Im not saying we have a bad a squad its not at the level it should be at in the key places to sustain a top 4 place. This changes if theres a major collapse from another top 4 side or we have two or three players playing at top form for a long period.

One of the best things about the UK is the contrast between super dense central London, pretty villages and unspoilt countryside all within 45 minutes of each other. Apart from forcing house prices up (which could've been managed in other ways) the greenbelt is a huge success. 

The last thing we want is low density urban sprawl like LA or Sydney - it takes at least 20 minutes drive just to nip to the nearest shops (because of the distance, traffic and lack of parking) We need more infill within London through converting brownfields into high density living. We should preserve old buildings whenever we can, but we should definitely remove some restrictions such as protected views. These are some great examples of densification and infill - [1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/4f/39/23/4f392360ae6fe266fafb3561fe0b7637.jpg) and [2](http://www.mikestewart.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maddox-Vancouver-by-Cressey-Mike-Stewart.jpg) and [3](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Zaha-Hadid-High-Line-Apartments-NYC-1.jpg) We need to do more projects in transforming brownfields - like Canary Wharf, Isle of Dogs, London Olympic Village etc.

Maybe it's down to the pace of the league, or maybe it's just confidence, but for somebody who is labeled as an amazing dribbler he's been poor on the ball.

No, it doesn't. It has to act as a depressant or stimulant *as well.* Smell doesn't work that way, odorants don't act as depressants or stimulants. They act as *stimuli.*

Though, if you did give someone the permanent marker and told them to huff it, then yeah, it would be supply. But they *intend* for it that to be the case anyway, so it's hardly a fair criticism of how it's written. It's something they *want* to ban.

Make no mistake, I'm not passing a moral judgement on this bill or anything like that. I'm saying, it's actually written to a fairly well standard and when people start saying ""oh it's going to ban glue and alcohol, and ya-da-da-da"" that they need to *read* it.

null,false,heytterebea,null,null,null,"whole family are beşiktaş fans, so i watched almost all the beşiktaş games for my entire life. 

i wouldn't be happy with a coach like bilic. some fans love him because he plays guitar, he is socialist, he is young and handsome -kinda- has an earing and he is a good person. no kidding. his look is ordinary comparing to the other coaches, and since he said he is socialist, beşiktaş fans, çarşı, loved him. 

other hand, the other fans dislike him because he is inadequately, lazy and he is not a winner. you probably saw only the european games and thought ""yeah, good coach omg arsenal lol liverpool etc.etc."" but in the league, he fucked up all the chances he had. he lost second place last year just because of his stubbornnes and sent gs to the cl. this year, he lost the first place just because of the same reasons with the last year and made gs champions. now think how much money lost beşiktaş and how much gs won -they played shiite but still earned that money. if you don't believe me, just watch last 5 league games of beşiktaş, see the table. he can't handle that pressure and he knows nothing about defending set pieces; besides attacking set pieces. his team only scored 3 set pieces goals this year. only 3. and conceded many.

he can't make comebacks. this year, beşiktaş lost 14 games in 20 that they conceded first. and won only 4. also beşiktaş always conceded last minute goals and he never cared of it -or tried and couldn't fixed, idk. in 2 seasons, if you divide games 10minparts, beşiktaş conceded 17 goals at last ten minutes of the games. and this is the most conceded part of 9 -if i didn't make any sense, 0-10 part 1, 10-20 part 2 .... 80-90 part 9 and 17 goals happened there.

he is not fair when it comes to giving jerseys. he always uses same players, if they are in shape. beşiktaş have cenk tosun, scored 1 goal per 127 minutes. when key player ba scored 1 in 125. but bilic always, i mean always, subbed ba with pektemek -which almost all fans hate him- and fucked the games (because he can't score, he can't pass, he can't cross, he can't dribble and he always injures himself, just google him to see his injury stats). also there's a 65 min mark, which bilic always subbed a wing player with olcay -olcay in or olcay out, it never changes. then 75. min mark which bilic makes a midfielder change -preferably tolgay (the only playmaker) outs and there's an 85 min mark, forward outs forward ins. that never changes. so, any rival coach can counter him very easily. (i mean, everyone knows beşiktaş squad before the games, everyone knows which tactic he will use and everyone knows when he will use his subs. there're no suprises here)

you may think being 3rd is not a bad thing, you may be right too but, beşiktaş can be 3rd even without a coach. that's how much bilic helped beşiktaş. 

he couldn't pass local cup groups, lost smaller teams. he never even won any derby since he first joined and this year, his side couldn't even scored one. this is a big shame and first in beşiktaş history. his side always played cowardly, he looked like coward and then he made statements like ""our true derby is bursaspor games"". well, bursa is not a rival to beşiktaş or gs, or fb. 

fans gone mad, you can imagine.

he sticks with 4th ref and always complains. ofc, it's a good thing when it comes to defend your team against bad ref decisions but sometimes you stop doing that and look at the pitch, just to see what's your team doing, that may be great. 

but no, he is always with the 4th ref, just to yell him and complain.

i wish best for you hammers, but don't get very excited about him. there's likely a huge chance that he will be your new allardyce.

I think there's a really great player in there, and his season at Southampton showed it.

If I was him though, or the coaching staff, I would ask him to focus on solidity though. Especially if he plays with Sakho.

Generally in a centreback pairing, you need one player to go forward and aggressively intercept the ball, while one hangs back and cleans up. In this case, Sakho does this extremely well, so Lovren has to sit back. He's more than quick enough, athletic enough to then clear up any mistakes made by Sakho.

He then also has more time to play the ball out of defence, as he will be 5-10 yards ahead of the forwards.

copied from [here](http://tr.reddit.com/r/Hammers/comments/392dng/football_agent_friend_of_bilic_tweets_that_he_has/)

whole family are beşiktaş fans, so i watched almost all the beşiktaş games for my entire life.

i wouldn't be happy with a coach like bilic. some fans love him because he plays guitar, he is socialist, he is young and handsome -kinda- has an earing and he is a good person. no kidding. his look is ordinary comparing to the other coaches, and since he said he is socialist, beşiktaş fans, çarşı, loved him.

other hand, the other fans dislike him because he is inadequately, lazy and he is not a winner. you probably saw only the european games and thought ""yeah, good coach omg arsenal lol liverpool etc.etc."" but in the league, he fucked up all the chances he had. he lost second place last year just because of his stubbornnes and sent gs to the cl. this year, he lost the first place just because of the same reasons with the last year and made gs champions. now think how much money lost beşiktaş and how much gs won -they played shiite but still earned that money. if you don't believe me, just watch last 5 league games of beşiktaş, see the table. he can't handle that pressure and he knows nothing about defending set pieces; besides attacking set pieces. his team only scored 3 set pieces goals this year. only 3. and conceded many.

he can't make comebacks. this year, beşiktaş lost 14 games in 20 that they conceded first. and won only 4. also beşiktaş always conceded last minute goals and he never cared of it -or tried and couldn't fixed, idk. in 2 seasons, if you divide games 10minparts, beşiktaş conceded 17 goals at last ten minutes of the games. and this is the most conceded part of 9 -if i didn't make any sense, 0-10 part 1, 10-20 part 2 .... 80-90 part 9 and 17 goals happened there.

he is not fair when it comes to giving jerseys. he always uses same players, if they are in shape. beşiktaş have cenk tosun, scored 1 goal per 127 minutes. when key player ba scored 1 in 125. but bilic always, i mean always, subbed ba with pektemek -which almost all fans hate him- and fucked the games (because he can't score, he can't pass, he can't cross, he can't dribble and he always injures himself, just google him to see his injury stats). also there's a 65 min mark, which bilic always subbed a wing player with olcay -olcay in or olcay out, it never changes. then 75. min mark which bilic makes a midfielder change -preferably tolgay (the only playmaker) outs and there's an 85 min mark, forward outs forward ins. that never changes. so, any rival coach can counter him very easily. (i mean, everyone knows beşiktaş squad before the games, everyone knows which tactic he will use and everyone knows when he will use his subs. there're no suprises here)

you may think being 3rd is not a bad thing, you may be right too but, beşiktaş can be 3rd even without a coach. that's how much bilic helped beşiktaş.

he couldn't pass local cup groups, lost smaller teams. he never even won any derby since he first joined and this year, his side couldn't even scored one. this is a big shame and first in beşiktaş history. his side always played cowardly, he looked like coward and then he made statements like ""our true derby is bursaspor games"". well, bursa is not a rival to beşiktaş or gs, or fb.

fans gone mad, you can imagine.

he sticks with 4th ref and always complains. ofc, it's a good thing when it comes to defend your team against bad ref decisions but sometimes you stop doing that and look at the pitch, just to see what's your team doing, that may be great.

but no, he is always with the 4th ref, just to yell him and complain.

i wish best for you hammers, but don't get very excited about him. there's likely a huge chance that he will be your new allardyce.

Not a comeback to adequately cover everybody's needs, but that blip upwards is a huge change from the New Labour era, when council housing fell down to practically zero. 

Something *has* to be done. Optimally, the most sustainable idea is for the state to work with developers and attack housing with the ferocity it was attacked with after the war - when Nye Bevan focused on establishing the NHS over building new council homes (he had both portfolios) meaning they *only* built 200,000 homes a year. Harold Macmillan became Minister of Housing after Churchill promised 300,000 homes a year and achieved the goal a year ahead of schedule. Harold Wilson bought it to over 400,000 a year, a fucking staggering number. [See for yourself.](http://www.conservativehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Suplly-Mega-Graph-Feb-2013.jpg)

There was a broad consensus that 50/50 public/private, give or take a few percent in either direction, was the way forward and people who lived in council flats in the 70s can tell you - single males with a decent working-class income could get council flats pretty easily!

That's the scale of operations that is needed. Anything less probably isn't going to work. Housing is going to be London's death sentence as the powerhouse of the UK - I can think of about a half-dozen people I know who have decamped from London to parts elsewhere because they either can't afford to buy a home or thought it was so ridiculous that they cashed out, got another home somewhere else mortgage free (one family off of just five years of equity) and did one, taking their talents elsewhere.

The elite group at the top decides policy, just like the UK Government's cabinet, but it still has to be accepted by MEPs.

Maybe Nuttall's just bitter because he knows he'll never be nominated or accepted.

On his other point about Cameron, he's stating the obvious. We know that Cameron's been pushed to the right by UKIP and those on the right of his party. All through the last five years, we've heard the creaking sound of Farage sliding the Overton window to the right and watched Cameron nudged to the right to keep up.  
We know that Cameron had to offer an EU referendum to avoid losing votes to UKIP, so that he could get another term in government.  

But we also know that Cameron never really wanted out of the EU. If he did, he'd have pushed for it a few years ago in the previous government, just like the Conservatives pushed the ""No to AV"" campaign.  
He's been closer to the Treasury finances than anyone in UKIP and had more conversations with heads of other member states than them, so he probably has more idea of what's at stake.

Time and time again, Prime Ministers have resisted an EU exit, have always said that now is not the time, and have put off a referendum. Maybe they know something the sceptics don't. 
No politician will suggest a referendum unless they think they'll get the result they want.
So of course Cameron will be pushing for a ""Yes"" (continued membership) as hard as possible before the referendum happens.

If he really thought he could get the result he wanted, he'd have allowed his MPs a free vote.
If he really thought that something as important as this should be decided by a popular vote like The X-Factor, he'd have allowed a free vote.  

But it's not weakness. It's just politics. It's another politician manipulating things to get the result he wants.

And here's Paul Nuttall desperately trying to weaken Cameron to get the result Paul Nuttall wants.

I understand what you're saying, but you can't design for everything.

At the end of the day, the question is this: what energy crash do you design to be survivable?  Someone will have to decide this in order to design the protection system.  If there are sufficient failsafes in the system (in the form of electronic, control and design considerations) then you are only designing for FOD on the track.  If those failsafes fail, why do you think your final protection system (which if it is passive will be huge and heavy, and if it is active will rarely be tested) will work any better?

While we will buy so quality players the majority will be mediocre and or will take take time to develop.  

Our problems all stem from last years mess up in the transfer window when we went for quantity over quality.  I have said it a number of times we are Arsenal from a few years ago.  The quality players we get and develop we will sell on.  While Wenger has his critics hes at a level above Rodgers. 

To be fair I am optimistic for this year. Rodgers had two difficult and unenviable tasks in fading out two legends of Carra and Stevie. Both legends and must be held in the highest regard but both cast very big shadows. I feel last season Steven indirectly was influencing Rodgers tactics as hes was criticized for playing him or not. A no win situation for him.  This burden has now been lifted and hopefully he can manage the way he wants and has no excuses.

And the idea that he'll be there for the taking next year isn't true.  One, there's every chance that Liverpool becomes a less attractive option for Klopp.  I think there's a great chance we finish 8th or worse this year, and that could make Klopp a little more cautious considering the added difficulty.  Two, Bayern Munich and Man City have coaches with contracts expiring next year (not that contracts matter all that much with those two).  We know City is waiting for Guardiola, and if they make it happen, I think Munich could come calling for Klopp.  That would be a hard job for him to turn down.  Or even if Guardiola stays at Munich, then I think City will probably move for Klopp.  Either way Klopp is going to have some attractive choices next year.  And if we want to really stretch the speculation, Wenger could be looking to retire next year, and Klopp would be a perfect replacement there.

I'm also an IT worker and have never had any real trouble finding work in the SW. Now at a reasonable pay grade I own a 'proper' (i.e not a new build) 3-bed-semi with a sensible mortgage which is within walking distance of a (small) town centre. While the house prices around here are rising, it's at a level which isn't snatching them away from first time buyers quite as quickly as other parts of the UK. 

There are downsides to being out here. One of the big things is that public transport is a joke (I kinda miss the tube) so you really do need a car. And in the small villages and smaller towns getting good internet services can be difficult (5Mb down, 0.03 up at home). 

The best situation would be that long-haul public transport becomes reliable and cheap (First Great Western are laughable). It's only an hour from here into Paddington. But I can't see that happening any time soon.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;What's the point. It's not going to make any difference to your opinion. The very first comment I made in this echo chamber someone brought up racism.

The point is that we can have a proper discussion and understand our differing viewpoints. I'm not trying to convert you to anything, merely trying to give you another perspective. I've been quite welcoming of your opinions here I feel, and I certainly haven't mentioned racism in this thread. 

&gt;I got as far as ""Immigration isn't really that much of a problem for most people, "". Hence the link to public opinion on immigration, which proves you wrong.

Ok, it's a concern. It's not a priority, and the only point of contention above is how you quantify ""much"" in my comment above. Only UKIP placed heavy emphasis on immigration policy during the general election and they got 10% of the vote share. Labour and the Conservatives, the parties that took the lion's share of votes, both placed heavy emphasis on the economy (or rather, how the other party would ruin it). Immigration just isn't as much of a concern as you make out it is, otherwise more people would be talking about it more than they are. Granted there are many who place it at the top of their priority list, but they are in the minority. 

And if you read further, your link doesn't at all address the overall conclusion of my comment, which is that Labour isn't being hurt by its immigration policy. Your link addresses one line, not the meat of the argument. You're not being downvoted (at least in this comment thread) because what you're saying is disagreeable, you're being downvoted for making a poor effort to contribute to the discussion. 

&gt;What you should have said is immigration isn't much of a problem for those it doesn't negatively effect, because we now have a society of 'I'm all right Jack'. One that despises it's own working classes.

We don't though. Decisions are made with the national interest in mind, and every votes in their own interest (including people who vote for anti-immigration policies. What is good for one group is never good for everybody). It is unfortunate that individuals lose their jobs, but everyone is better for it. You yourself obviously haven't been hindered too badly by immigration policy if you now run your own business successfully enough that you are now in a position to employ other people. It is easy to get sucked into rhetoric surrounding the cases of individuals but the truth is that the individual doesn't really matter. Economic policies are made to benefit the country, not you personally. And you keep mentioning that it's the working classes that feel this disproportionately but I'm yet to see convincing evidence that this is the case. Indeed, the link way at the top of this comment thread provides evidence to the contrary. 

&gt;Someone in here even said it was my fault I lost my job for Christ sakes.

My point is we have tonnes of parties with basically no difference in policy. So our system is very diluted and the worst thing you can do in making decisions is trying to make everyone happy because in doing that you make no one happy. I can hear you say well do i want dictator ship no. What i want is a new system based on resources not money not the idea that we were all born less than 5k years ago and were meant to use everything and forget about future generations.

Our whole life we somehow put out faith in poltics to fix real-world problems but all politics can do is make laws. Making a law that someone should go to prison if they kill someone is one thing but does it actually stop murder? Making it law that drugs are illegal not only drives the price up on black markets but does it stop drugs? Does making laws over renewable energies to be used reduce fossil fuel use?

Politics is a waste of time now a days. And all you have to do is look at how few people even vote these days. 55% is good turn out really?!

Even i cant find it but on reddit uk politics someone polotted the fical policies between labour and conservative over the last 5 years and the difference was miniscule. So really when you vote for a party thinking that your vote makes a difference is pointless now.

What we have is a bunch of spineless puppies who's opinion can be changed at the drop of a hat.

&gt;According to USDA, 26 federally-inspected packing plants process 500,000 cattle or more per
year. Together, these 26 plants process 76 percent of the cattle harvest.
Large plants have multiple lines to handle higher volumes of cattle, which enables them to utilize
certain technologies and enjoy efficiencies of scale.

&gt;USDA also provides a larger number of inspectors for larger plants. Some of the largest plants in
the U.S. may have 25 inspectors present during two operating shifts on any given day.
Although in the past, many plants slaughtered and processed products all in one location, today,
the work in many cases has become more specialized. A cattle slaughter plant will ship beef to
other plants to be processed into ground beef or cut into steaks. Again, by specializing, plants
can gain greater efficiencies, which helps make the products more affordable.

&gt;The bottom line is that whether a plant is large or small, all plants must meet the same USDA
food safety standards and other federal regulations and are inspected using the same
requirements.

Using wording to make it sound acceptable that a large beef farm exists simply because its federally inspected, or its being more ""efficient"". When really the problem is that the rules allow them to overlook lots of humane aspects of animal agriculture.

Gerrard and Carragher were always safe bets because you just knew they'd never leave and that they were something of the personification of the club.

I personally have a Coutinho kit because I think he'll be here for a while.

it, and

&gt; (b) is not an exempted substance.

&gt; (2) For the purposes of this Act a substance produces a psychoactive effect in a person if, **by stimulating or depressing the person’s central nervous system, it affects the person’s mental functioning or emotional state**; and references to a substance’s psychoactive effects are to be read accordingly.

The advantage I noticed however is that it's much easier to walk to work. Most of these towns outside the UK are smaller than a London borough.

He gets in great positions but mostly because of his pace, not because of awareness. He's incredibly wasteful in the final third, not just in front of Goal but anywhere near the box. I don't think he's technically as good as people think either, he relies heavily on his speed, which is fine, there's nothing wrong with that once it's effective.  

I'm a big fan of him as as player but I think if we got 25m for him we wouldn't be getting a raw deal. He has potential but that's a risk to any buyer. He may keep improving, he may fizzle out. He's not a game changer for us in my opinion. I think the reaction that  the majority of the fanbase has had speaks volumes. He's gone from a popular enough player to strongly disliked - if he was that good, Liverpool fans would love him regardless, as we did Suarez, and I'm not talking about the reddit fan base. 

The comparison with Rooney is silly (IMO), Rooney is world class and had a poor end of season that year. He's an out and out striker and still a far better player to have in midfield than lil Raheem. 

Don't get me wrong, Sterling is a very good player and I would like to hang on to him, but there are as many flaws in his game as there are positives. For a player to be worth even 30-40m at that age, I'd have expected him to perform at every level and be scoring a lot more goals, let alone 40-50m.

The channel 4 one is the most interesting as it shows the only time that Scotlands oil fields made enough to cover the costs of running Scotland is 2008/2009 after that the oil price collapsed and so now Scotland is running at a loss. If you didn't have a parliment which is if we're being honest you don't need as the snp are sitting in the houses of parliment, you would be running at a positive balance. Also I haven't even mentioned the Barnett formula which is hugely unfair to people in england/wales and N.I. and is paid for no decent reason at all, leading to over a 1000 pounds per head extra spent on people in Scotland again being unfair to the rest of the union. I personally wanted the snp to win the referendum so we could watch you fail and end this once and for all. This is the snp who at the moment are currently voting against more devolution in the houses of parliment because they know they'd have to raise taxes in Scotland to cover their spending if they were given full fiscal responsibility.

Both Rangers and Celtic are Scottish, they have always been based here, their biggest legends are generally Scots, their fans are predominantly Scottish.

The difference is that Rangers fans are generally preconceived as having unionist loyalties, whereas Celtic are associated with the Republican  southern Irish. In reality these preconceptions are incredibly exaggerated and used to create drama for documentaries like the one you mentioned. Literally nobody gives a fuck what your political or national views or heritage is so long as you are wearing the same coloured jersey. I actually think a lot of the Irish support of Celtic comes from the simple fact that the Irish football league is even shittier than Scotland's!

The biggest thing with the Irish/Union divide is that you wouldn't want to go to an Irish pub on an Old Firm game day wearing a Rangers top. In scummy areas (ones you would never be in anyway so wouldn't worry) you'd get hassle. But the same goes for a lot of things - you wouldn't go to a man city supporters bar in a man united jersey - so its pretty simple.

null,false,deviden,null,null,null,"Formaldehyde is only released at high voltages, essentially because you're heating the e-liquid to the point of burning it. No formaldehyde is present at low voltages, so for vapers the question is one of picking the right battery output. 

For me (and most other vapers) with batteries fixed by design in a 3.3 V to 3.8 V range there's no reasonable danger of inhaling formaldehyde. It's the variable device users who are in danger.

From your link: 

&gt; Here we present results of an analysis of commercial e-liquid vaporized with the use of a “tank system” e-cigarette featuring a variable-voltage battery. The aerosolized liquid was collected in an NMR spectroscopy tube (10 50-ml puffs over 5 minutes; 3 to 4 seconds per puff). With each puff, 5 to 11 mg of e-liquid was consumed, and 2 to 6 mg of liquid was collected. At low voltage (3.3 V), we did not detect the formation of any formaldehyde-releasing agents (estimated limit of detection, approximately 0.1 μg per 10 puffs). At high voltage (5.0 V), a mean (±SE) of 380±90 μg per sample (10 puffs) of formaldehyde was detected as formaldehyde-releasing agents

(the detectable margin of error is 0.1 μg, which is one tenth of a billionth of a gram)  

If any regulation should be brought in to control vaping, the first (and only, imo) priority should be to restrict the range of voltages possible for device output.

I honestly don't think he's -that- wasteful in the final 3rd, yes he missed a few pretty good chances this season but for fuck sake he's 20 years old and was our main man, putting that kind of pressure on someone so young is absolutely retarded. Last season when he wasn't our main man whatsoever he wasn't anywhere near as wasteful and even had a similar shots/goal ratio to Suarez and Sturridge which is really good. 

Of course he's a game changer, what kind of statement is that, he's a chance creating machine and was pretty good vs the top teams last season when played in his proper position. £25m would be a joke, we wouldn't be able to replace him for that. We spent £25m on Lallana and £20m on Markovic last summer and even though Sterling had a bad last 4 months he had a better season than both. What Sterling has done is worse than what Suarez did imo, he has pretty much insulted the  club saying we're showing no ambition so fans are pretty pissed with him... even though almost every fan thinks the same about the club so it's pretty funny.

The comparision with Rooney isn't really silly, he was playing in midfield towards the end of last season and was still a very important player.. for there to be such a fracas about Sterling displacing him in the team that means Sterling must have been doing something right.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, Sterling is a very good player and I would like to hang on to him, but there are as many flaws in his game as there are positives. For a player to be worth even 30-40m at that age, I'd have expected him to perform at every level and be scoring a lot more goals, let alone 40-50m. He's hardly the shining light in an under performing team.

By Sterling's age Ronaldo had scored 9 goals with 8 assists in 61 games for United.  Sterling has scored 18 goals with 14 assists in 95 appearances for us so far... that's a far better record. Would you not have paid £30m for Ronaldo when he was 20? United spent £12m on the guy when he was 19 years old after he had scored 3 goals in 25 games in Portugal, that's like £25m now.. United also spent £22m on 19 year old Anderson 8 years ago, again that's like £30m++ now.

Would you pay £30m for Coutinho? he scores way less goals. But not paying £30m for him would be ridiculous.


How has he created more chances than Coutinho if he isn't technically good anyway? if you want to see a player who's pace and not much else just look at Ibe this season, so highly rated yet his end product is barely Premier league standard.. 6 chances created in 622 minutes..",null,1,null,1433857481,null,0,false,0,cs0jxvv,null,t3_3953e5,null,t1_cs0jxvv,null,t1_cs0j65u,null,null,null,1437564108,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

2. The minute anyone of us is fortunate enough to buy a property we take on the same mindset. Even the most socially liberal gain comfort in a high property market.

1. Perpetual motion doesn't work. You still need to get the cart to the same speed, but now it weighs more. So that takes more energy.

2. The mass of an object is irrelevant when climbing a hill through momentum alone. Only speed and resistance come in to play. Increased weight will reduce deceleration due to aerodynamics slightly, but will increase it due to rolling resistance.

3. What do you think adding extra weight to the cart will do to the track wear and tear? 

You also start rambling about additional crash protection BETWEEN carts. As someone else has pointed out, why not just ban roller coasters? You can save a few injuries, and nobody's life will really suffer as a result.

Or, accept that accidents occasionally happen (60 people PER DAY have life changing injuries on UK roads, and 5 die). The world runs on risk analyses, and not every risk can be completely eliminated.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"Public spending in Scotland is above average, just as it is in your region of the UK (NW England). There are clear and obvious reasons for why those regions should have higher levels of public spending, namely the intergenerational effects of the de-industrialisation in the 80s and, as regards Scotland, servicing the UK's most remote communities in our Highlands and Islands.

It is for similar reasons that Wales has nearly as much spending per head as Scotland and Northern Ireland (a constituent country that you describe as being unfairly treated by Barnett) has **more** public spending than Scotland.  

As to your second link, it is completely irrelevant. The article discusses the relative costs of rebuilding the parliament *building* or continuing to maintain it. It's nothing to do with relative levels of public spending, almost entirely defined by spending decisions taken at Westminster. 

Just as a final note, your discussion of Scotland as 'running at a loss' is telling of an almost colonial attitude towards the country. Scotland is not a business. It does not exist to run at a 'positive balance' to the benefit of, mostly, England. It is supposedly a valued and integral part of the United Kingdom and, within countries, some areas run larger deficits or smaller deficits than the average. Fiscal transfers are perfectly normal within countries, and your own city is one of the greatest beneficiaries of that. 

As a final note the Barnett formula (by accident, not design) will lead to a convergence of spending levels between the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom (with, for example, a £10per capita per annum increase in spending in England translating to £10 pc/pa in Wales, NI, and Scotland and the baseline being reduced in importance with inflation). This was the reality before the Scottish Parliament was formed in the 90s too, though 'barnett bypasses' were far more often so the convergence that should have happened between the 70s and 90s did not take place.

Actually, one final point, localism and regionalism have ~~benefits~~ effects aside from giving a platform to independence movements. The ability to make bespoke legislation and spending choices is beneficial to local areas and their economies. That the SNP are represented in parliament does not remove the need for a parliament for the better administration of the different regions. Pesonally, I think it's telling that the four regions that experienced an above average level of growth in disposable income since the advent of devolution were those four regions - London, Scotland, NI, and Wales - that had real powers devolved.

If they were colonists, there might only be a few people. But if I were running the colony from the start, and had access to a cloning process as described, I would do it this way: You send a bare minimum of active people to the planet to get your cloning station set up. Then you start cranking out clones based not on the people you sent, but on templates you brought with you. So all the soldiers are young because you would want young, strong colonists, not old people. Cobb is old because he is based one of the original colonists, not a template.

If Cobb is as old as he looks, he ought to have been a member of the original landing party, in which case he would know what the Source really is. 

Cobb was not in his forties or fifties. He was created by the machine to be a general and thus ""born old"". As to the apparent discrepancy in the first two, the Doctor explains at the end of the episode that both can be true because the war burns through several generations in a day. 

In other words, it's (d). Privates emerge with 25-year-old bodies, generals emerge with 45-year-old bodies.

The vast majority of people hook their telly up to the aerial. The vast majority of people watch the regular five channels at some point. Therfore the vast majority of people who own a TV need a licence, so the script reflects the most likely case scenario an employee will face. They also have training in how to deal with people who (nicely) prove to them that they don't need a licence. That training, as far as I've witnessed, is to thank the person and walk away.

Have you ever had a TV Licensing person tell you you're right, you don't need a licence, then thank you and walk away? I have. 

Wouldn't that be nicer than having them walk away determined to fuck you for your shitty attitude and unco-operative behaviour?

Moving away from TV Licensing for a sec, I've recently had a run-in with Eon over a gas meter check I was supposed to have done last year, but which got lost in the admin. I talked to their complaints department and proved that they were the ones at fault for not scheduling a meter inspection. I got a £20 credit on my account for the hassle they'd caused me.

When the inspector came round, he took a look and was satisfied, but came back later saying that his gizmo said he needed to check the electric meter instead. This was a lie, the electric meter had been done a couple of months ago and didn't need doing again.

So I phoned and complained and got a puzzled complaints handler apologising profusely as nobody had a clue why he would do that.

Today, in a ""totally unrelated incident"" which happens to be roughly a second class delivery time from inspector's visit, I got a cheque from Eon for £40, purportedly to cover overcharging that my meter had been doing.

This wouldn't be suspiciously relatable to the phone call except for one slight point. I got that £40 repayment for historic overcharging *last year*.

Even Karl Marx expressed a lot of admiration for the achievements of capitalism. The first chapter of the Communist Manifesto basically starts out pretty much as a love letter to capitalism. 

Because capitalism, according to Marx, was what would enable the enormous leap in productive forces to make socialism *possible*. 

Take this paragraph for example:

&gt; The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.

Or this:

&gt; The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.

Or this:

&gt; The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?

(yes, there is a ""but"" coming later)

The modern European welfare systems, for example, only became something people even contemplated with the rise of capitalism.

It's a terrible irony that there's a large segment of the left that has turned so decidedly against technology, given that socialism as an ideology started out as optimism over the advances possible with the rise of industrialisation and new technology: For the first time in human history people started believing that eradicating poverty would become a realistic possibility.

1. Apple wasn't losing any sales to competitors due to NFC because nobody was using it on competitor's phones.
2. Apple Pay actually does include something completely new that is not available on any Android Phone at the moment (though will later when Android Pay and Samsung Pay finally launch): EMV Tokenization. It's a major security improvement for contactless payments and it just wasn't available before now. Apple waited to launch Apple Pay until tokenization was available.

Why would it *become* stagnant when every day a larger number of people can use it?

Generally a bad season for Zaba, culminating in the stretch where he gave away free kicks leading directly to goals for Sunderland, Everton and Arsenal (when we were looking to equalise) in 3 games on the trot, which resulted in him getting dropped for the Chelsea game. We also saw the return of the needless fouls that were the reason Micah was ahead of him for so long. His attacking play was pretty lacking as well. 

I do not blame Zabaleta for this at all though, I believe it is 100% down to fatigue. He played 50 games for us, then a world cup, then jumped into another season with us. Not to mention the arrival of a newborn baby.

We used him quite a lot less this year (only 36 games) but IMO Sagna was still underutilised and Pellegrini is going to have to use him a lot more next season if we are to see the best Zabaleta back again. He needs a break, and with the Copa America, that's not going to happen over the summer.

As for the Navas-Zabaleta question - 100 times no! They meshed perfectly last year because zabaleta loves that underlapping run into the box between fullback and centreback and he scored a couple of big goals that way, and got most of his assists that way. 8 assists as well! By far his best season in terms of attacking contributions.

The problem again is tiredness, he can't seem to commit to attacking so much and running into the box because he hasn't got the energy to run 90m back to position if we lose the ball. That's why he hangs back on the wing behind Navas. That's how I see it at least. It also doesn't help that the boxes are packed as well, so less room to do his thing. That's down to how much slower we were this season in comparison to 13/14.

I really hope we get him back to his best, him kissing the badge after scoring in Rome was probably the highlight of my season.

[Glyphosate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10854122) (Roundup) is [not](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798302) dangerous to [humans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22683395), as many [reviews](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202229) have shown, and [neither does it accumulate in humans (PDF)](http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0178fact.pdf).  Even a review by the [European Union (PDF)](http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/ph_ps/pro/eva/existing/list1_glyphosate_en.pdf) agrees that Roundup poses no potential threat to humans.  Furthermore, both glyphosate and AMPA, its degradation product, are considered to be [much more toxicologically and environmentally *benign*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912208) than most of the herbicides replaced by glyphosate.  Roundup resistance by plants is completely irrelevant for those who dislike it, since if plants become immune to RoundUp, then farmers will stop using it and go back to other herbicides.

&gt; The EPA considers glyphosate to be noncarcinogenic and relatively low in dermal and oral acute toxicity.[23] The EPA considered a ""worst case"" dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions.[23]

I'd definitely think about locking your mortgage into a lower rate (1%-1.5% seems widely available) rather than paying it all off. That's need you to have about 40% equity, so 60% LTV. That should decrease your monthly mortgage payment quite significantly, as both the mortgage balance and the interest rate being charged on it will have reduced.

As you imply - all of this depends on your own risk tolerance. In a purely mathematical scenario you'd be best to then ignore the mortgage altogether and use your surplus cash to avoid higher rate tax.

So firstly pensions up to your annual limits and then some other more exotic things like VCTs - frankly I'd leave them alone for the moment and have that side of things as the very last port of call on your quest to line your finances up.

Monevator is a wonderful site, but that broker table is really confusing. There's nothing wrong with the information in it - there's just a lot of it!

Given the numbers you've got available to you, you're quickly going to be in a position where your pot is high enough that a fixed fee platform will work our cheaper than a platform which charges a percentage. For the time being I'd put everything that you're investing into an unmanaged global index fund and leave it alone. Vanguard seem to be the biggest name for this sort of thing.

Both those signings were totally at odds with the system and style of play Rodgers clearly  favoured with SAS.  Is it any wonder their goal return was so poor.  It's the same reason Torres worked well in our system  but really not so much with Chelsea later. He didn't become just become terrible overnight even accounting for injuries.

He has to be more tactically astute when it comes to actually picking a team that will be effective on the pitch.

&gt;Over the past 40 years, dozens of studies have shown the connection between 2,4-D and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cancers of the blood) and soft-tissue sarcoma in people. Other research reveals that 2,4-D enters breast milk and semen where it disrupts normal hormone functions, which can also cause serious and lasting effects during fetal and infant development. In fact, in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, researchers have found higher rates of certain birth defects in areas with the highest use of 2,4-D and other similar herbicides. The higher rate of birth defects was most evident in infants conceived in the spring—the time of year when the herbicide is most used. Those birth defects were significantly higher in males, and consisted mostly of cardiac and lung abnormalities. Young children are most at risk for indoor exposure to 2,4-D because they crawl and play on the floor, and then put their hands in their mouths, or the chemical residue from the floor is then absorbed into their skin or inhaled.

You pointed how he dithers behind Navas.  He did it last season when Navas was on too, so I don't see it being about tiredness so much as the two of them wanting to occupy the same space.

Under Mancini I never agreed with the idea that we lacked width because the full backs gave us plenty of it.  Navas doesn't make us any wider in my book, it's just a different guy providing the same width, and forcing Zaba to keep making runs into traffic with the ball arriving on his weaker foot.

I would argue that although the women, as you say, will always be of lower athletic ability than the men and to argue otherwise would be ridiculous. But it is at least possible for them to be a hell of a lot better than they currently are. In purely physical terms, there is no reason that the top women's team shouldn't be better than the bottom men's team. The advantage the men's teams have is not purely physical, but financial. A lot of time and money goes into making them as good as they are and that simply isn't available for the women's teams. That goes for a lot of sports. 

Also, re: Holmes vs Ball, I'd still rather watch two average Joes race than an average Joe racing a professional sprinter.

I'm not saying you have to watch it, I'm not saying that it is necessarily as entertaining as the men's game. Just that the fact that they aren't as skilled as the men doesn't necessarily mean it's not worth anyone's time. I don't think it's a necessary comparison.

Q5 (15) ‘1950-1975 opportunities increased for women’

The period of 1950 to 1975 increased women’s opportunities drastically, in the form of increased affluence, rights and freedom. This can be seen in the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 which ensured the Equal Pay Act of 1970 as women could now take businesses to court and gain compensation if they were unfairly discriminated against in the form of lower wages than men or businesses offering promotions to men over women with equal experience. Source G shows how this increased her wage from £27 a week to £73 a week and how kind everyone was, this source is likely to be reliable as it was taken from an interview 5 years later, however parts could be exaggerated as her memory fails. Also women benefited from increased freedom in terms of their body through The abortion Act of 1967 and the pill being widely available from 1964 onwards, this is shown in source E as the cartoonist sarcastically mock families who chose not to take the pill and now have horrible and unruly lives, however this may not be representative of the population as a whole.

Although, throughout the period sexism remained and opportunities were not always increased, this can be seen by source E as it is a report from a feminists in 1971 showing how women got paid less for the same work as men. However is not that reliable as it may be exaggerated to bring more power to women and show how annoyed feminists were.
Overall, opportunities increased largely because in theory sexism in the work place was illegal, this caused increased affluence for women and increased their power, such as success in parliament and Margret Thatcher being secretary of Education from 1973. However like anything it carried on in small parts which can be seen by source E.

For example, you say: &gt; it is a fact that he has been viewed as a hard worker before

Great. But being a called a ""hard worker"" by some manager completely unrelated to Chelsea doesn't mean that such was enough to make the grade in what Mourinho was looking for at that position. But you still conclude that there was something else ""really going on"".

Regardless, the Mata and KDB situations are very alike in certain specific ways, like the fact that neither fit into the mold the Mourinho intended for that position in the club. And both were welcome to stay and fight for more PT, but both chose instead to leave, which Mourinho allowed them to do. And both have since been questioned by many on this sub after the players have gone on to do good things for their new teams. AND, most of those fans fail to mention (like you failed to do) anything whatsoever about the specific attributes that Mourinho wants in his players.

You are also assuming quite a lot, like the fact that you're Belgian equating to you knowing more about this or that player. That's an absolutely asinine and moronic thing to assume about someone you've never met.

KDB is a great player, but that doesn't mean he fits into the team Mourinho had built, or that there was anything untoward about his time at Chelsea.

Especially the first one, is what I'd think of as a classic Zabaleta run, and Navas being a proper winger makes the LB stay wide and creates that gap between LB and CB which he runs into.

I don't think he really has the pace to be a traditional, round the outside full back whipping crosses in, so this is what works for him, and Navas arriving did correspond with his massive jump in assists.

I actually just looked it up on transfermarkt, and Navas was playing in 6 of the 8 games Zaba got assists in last season.

Lucas and Sterling should be higher than they will be, but because Lucas is fantastic at DM but not really good elsewhere (in an attacking sense) he always gets shafted.

Toure - 77. Just not such a big drop. 

 Allen - 77 he is a player who isn't really recognised that much and I don't think he played enough/great enough to warrant an upgrade. 

Coutinho - 82 maybe 83, might depend on his Copa America performance. 

Lallana - 80 have to agree, didn't play enough for upgrade, and was good enough to not downgrade. 

Markovic - 77 was pushed into a WB when played so didn't perform that well due to the position. So a minor DG. 

 Ibe - 72, 6 upgrade could have been a bit drastic, EA don't seem to give out massive upgrades, unless it's a player like Kane. 74 for sure when winter comes. 

 Lovren - 77 yeah. 


Sturridge - 82 or 81. EA like giving downgraded to injured players. Agüero got given a -2 because of injury. 

Balotelli - 80 bad season by a ""big"" name. So only -2

We live on a small island with a large population; that is what forces land to be rationed, and what necessitates green belt regulations. Without these, we would get urban sprawl of endless low-density housing, eating up the arable land.

He dismisses the value of land for food production with one line, but that is one of the primary reasons for keeping it. It helps us to maintain a level of independence so we are not overly-reliant on imports.

The answer to shortage of housing supply is not to build out, it is build up and increase the density of housing in existing residential areas. This has the benefit of being able to concentrate transport and services, with the added benefit reducing the need for people to travel. Our green spaces are then preserved for whatever we need them for; recreation, crops, livestock, or even bio-fuels. 

He claims ""only a tiny fraction of their vast extent would solve the crisis of housing"" but small bits add up. If every generation takes a little bit more, we end up with nothing left. We could also solve the crisis of housing by instead of building low-density housing estates we built high-rise towers.

Americans cannot use the Tier 5 work visa. I'm not from there, so I'm not sure what other options you have, but I'm sure there are alternatives. Commonwealth countries get easier access to the UK, so it isn't necessary for a job provider to sponsor residents from there, however I believe sponsorship is a requirement for work visas from other countries. I've also heard first-hand that attaining sponsorship can be tricky; typically only larger businesses can do it, and positions at those larger business are by nature more competitive and harder to get. 

The other option is being declared as a dependent. However, as someone else noted, she has to be registered on a graduate programme longer than one year. At Oxford, that's pretty much just the PhD/DPhil and MPhil, since *most one-year Masters programmes are 9 months. 

If her programme does meet that criteria though, she can declare you as a dependent for as long as she is studying AND you can work a full-time job. However that's only if all the other conditions I've listed above are met, and it sounds like she's on one of the 9-month programmes.

    No plaintiffs claim that contamination has yet occurred in any crops they have grown or seed they have sold.

This guy was on Food Inc. and claimed this happened to him. [Here](http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/38991/index.do) is the court case. 

     The results of these tests show the presence of the patented gene in a range of 95-98% of the canola sampled.

 This simply cannot happen from wind-drift pollen. What he *admitted to doing* is spraying roundup on a part of his field that he knew was likely contaminated by the pollen. Then, he collected the surviving seeds and replanted them, proving that he intentionally and knowingly planted patented plants.

     the defendants infringed a number of the claims under the plaintiffs' Canadian patent number 1,313,830 by planting, in 1998, without leave or licence by the plaintiffs, canola fields with seed saved from the 1997 crop which seed was known, or ought to have been known by the defendants to be Roundup tolerant and when tested was found to contain the gene and cells claimed under the plaintiffs' patent. By selling the seed harvested in 1998 the defendants further infringed the plaintiffs' patent.

There's the verdict.

The ISP doesn't just have a record of you visiting the page. They do have records of you pulling the video stream over your connection. That is all it takes to be in breach of the rules. Technically proving you pulled a live stream is the easy bit.

Do you have an actual source for this? GCHQ and the NSA snooping on everything isn't quite the same.

&gt; The ISP doesn't just have a record of you visiting the page. They do have records of you pulling the video stream over your connection. That is all it takes to be in breach of the rules. Technically proving you pulled a live stream is the easy bit.

There's a big difference between keeping records of HTTP requests, and detailed records of every packet you send or receive

Think about it from a logistics point of view, no ISP would want to be building the sort of storage equipment to store that data, let alone install equipment to collect it. GCHQ might, but not the ISPs

&gt; Although we know all major UK ISPs will send that data on with or without a warrant. There is only one ISP I'm aware of who require the warrant before they will dig the data out.

&gt; There's a big difference between keeping records of HTTP requests, and detailed records of every packet you send or receive

So then you know that to log a video stream has been transferred you don't need to store the stream. Just the HTTP or even TCP header data of the stream itself. Most video streams are done via HTTP anyway.

&gt; I'd bet my house on the idea that TV Licensing / BBC hasn't ever asked for co-operation on iPlayer usage

Can I have your house?

Nothing about HTTP logs or anything even more invasive

Something they could *possibly* do is get the information described above and match that to the BBC's own iPlayer data (if the BBC even keeps data on every IP that has ever streamed live TV), but even that's a stretch due to the cost/effort involved - we're talking £150 TV licences here, not a massive fraud case - and wouldn't do much to catch someone streaming Sky or ITV or Ch4/5

&gt; So then you know that to log a video stream has been transferred you don't need to store the stream. Just the HTTP or even TCP header data of the stream itself. Most video streams are done via HTTP anyway.

You'd still have to store information on every one of the millions of connections (or indivdual packets for UDP) that your customers make. That's a lot of data. And if the content isn't being stored, it makes the likelihood of prosecution even less likely. Who is to say I'm watching live TV or a news clip? One is illegal, one is not

That's probably why the NSA has all those giant data centers in the middle of nowhere. It's not the sort of thing the ISP is in a position to store

&gt; Freedom of information act confirming that people have been successfully prosecuted for watching BBC on non-television devices.

What is a non-television device? Is it someone watching TV on their computer using a TV tuner stick and not through the internet? It says nothing about that, or about iPlayer usage. In fact, they won't tell you, as it's withheld

It's antithetical to free-enquiry and free-thought and the principles of freedom of speech.  It's against everything university should stand for.  It's valuing safety over challenging ideas.

I wouldn't mind us finishing 5th or 6th and winning the Europa league. We don't necessarily need to finish in top 4 to play in CL anymore. 

When a manager gets into top four and gets into the group stages of CL he is making financial resources available for the club or if he goes to the finals of Europa league and wins it, he is making financial resources available for the club. Complaining we can't compete because everyone else is richer than us is not the solution.  There is more than one way to get into CL now.

Magistrates aren't paid. They're all volunteers. Possibly you should do some research. Here's a start:

13% of defendants in Magistrates courts are alleged TV Licence evaders, but as the cases are extremely quick, they add up to only 0.3% of court time. In Scotland most cases are disposed of out of court.

Those who can afford it (the court applies means testing) are charged court costs so the taxpayer only pays for those who can't afford such cost. The average fine is £170, but this is also means-tested so those on lower incomes will be charged significantly less.

Watching or recording live TV without a licence is not a recordable offence. This means the court maintains a record of the judgement, but that the conviction doesn't go on a centrally-held criminal record. A conviction for this offence doesn't have to be disclosed when seeking employment unless it is for a job that requires an enhanced criminal records check (such as becoming a lawyer).",null,0,null,1433874643,null,0,false,0,cs0uwxd,null,t3_395f6m,null,t1_cs0uwxd,null,t1_cs0qdnz,null,null,null,1436853533,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

It also indicates **no apparent risk to human health from e-cigarette emissions** based on the compounds analyzed. The authors recognize that future research assessing exposures to bystanders and users will be imperative for fully understanding the impacts from use of an electronic cigarette.

null,false,redstarduggan,,Belfast,null,"That's fine, everyone has an opinion. I suspect I have the same one when it comes to certain people/organisations.

It's important I think to make sure a distinction is made between the Orange Order, and the bands. They are unrelated in the vast majority of cases (I know of only one band that is linked to the OO).

I'm not a member of the OO, and no one in my family has been to my knowledge, but I know and have known plenty of people in it. To say that those people are anti-Catholic isn't fair on them as it isn't true. Yes the OO is a sectarian organisation by definition, but as with a lot of things, the vocal and obvious minority tar everyone with the same brush.

That being said, I'm no fan of the OO, or it's attempts to politicise what it does. It should concern itself with it's primary function.

As for bands, I've been in a few and generally had a good laugh. I've been in bands with catholics in them, they like to bang a drum same as everyone else. Of course this wasn't in Belfast, and was in bands that were concerned about playing well rather than making noise like the 'blood and thunder' bands. The disappointing thing about the band 'scene' in Belfast is just how many of these there are as opposed to melody flute bands for example, or indeed marching pipe bands. It's a shame, it really is.

Whether you think there is cultural value or not is largely irrelevant. 'Orange' culture, or protestant culture to be more accurate is a part of Irish culture, and is likely to remain so for some time. What we need to do is to marginalise the fringe elements that make it so unpalatable to our fellow countrymen.

I believe Belfast is the problem here. Parades in more rural areas are of an entirely different nature, and the main 12th parades in any town but Belfast is a much more enjoyable affair in my opinion. Look at Derry. They have almost zero issues with parades now since the local orders and residents discuss matters properly with mutual respect on both sides. An example to all.

I don't think the 12th is likely to be pushed as a major tourist event, primarily because as people have said, the biggest and most obvious parade in Belfast tends to have undercurrents and just isn't quite as nice a day out as anywhere else. If anything I would promote the 13th in Scarva over the 12th any day of the week, that's a great daty out.

Are you an ISP with millions of users and near constant 24/7 heavy usage? Not to mention the non-HTTP stuff.

Again, the Data Retention Directive doesn't require it, and ISPs aren't going to do it if they are not required to. 

&gt; Well the URL of the HTTP request would say that.

Does it? I'm not sure that the iPlayer uses such simple URLs as www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/bbcone.sdp (or whatever, I don't know the intracacies of how iPlayer works). Then there's the whole legal issue of what constitutes viewing. Does requesting a stream and not playing it mean you've viewed it? A lot of loopholes here. A decent technical expert could probably pick holes in a resulting court case - so I would bet that the BBC hasn't opened that can of worms

This is why the BBC likely has not ever tried to pursue this. Too many loopholes, and they can more easily secure a prosecution on some one clearly watching TV through an aerial

&gt; The ISPs are also not logging that data for £150 TV licences. They're logging it for all investigations the police have ongoing.

Well, they aren't logging it at all as the DRD doesn't require it. The point I was making was that the BBC/TV Licensing would not be going to all this effort for the sake of £150

&gt; Storing that much data is not expensive. Recovering data on a single keyed field is not that expensive. Pattern matching across all that data from every ISP and every other input stream you can take is that expensive. The NSA datacenters are not about storage primarily, they're about analysis. But I'm really not sure how we got here...

We got there because it's the intelligence agencies that actually will be storing this stuff, not the ISPs. I'd assume the NSA has to store the *data* in a *data*centre before they can do anything with it? And we already know that the NSA and friends really do have fibre taps on major internet links

&gt; So when the question in the FOIR explicitly asks about iPlayer, you're going to argue that the response is a bit fuzzy and isn't valid... OK.

Well, it is fuzzy and invalid. It doesn't say anything that is particularly conclusive. It doesn't say ""yes, we have prosecuted people for using iPlayer"". It says that they have prosecuted people for using something that isn't a television. Which could be a lot of things that have nothing to do with streaming TV over the internet. They won't tell you what it is, though

Not sure I understand the comment.  Literature as in printed matter.  I chose the example of The Guardian because it's the ideological opposite to The Sun and I wanted to see if your position would apply to any newspaper. 

&gt;They've banned the sun because they've decided, democratically I assume (that's how they made the decision on my campus), that page 3 is a derogatory feature and objectifies women.

OK, but I fundamentally disagree with this tactic!  Democracy is great, but I don't think that it should ever be used as a means to ban undesirable reading material.   Putting what reading material can or can't be purchased up to popular vote leads to censorship of unpopular ideas.  And, as I said before, I wouldn't wish *anyone* to have that power over me.  Nor would I wish to have that power over anyone else.  It's called intellectual freedom and it's something that used to be valued in our universities.

&gt;how do you feel about the 23-year boycott of the sun in liverpool?

In cases where people have put pressure on shops to withdraw a newspaper they object to I'm against it.  Stop telling other people what they should or shouldn't read or sell.

Want to get people to stop reading The Sun?  You actually have to do the hard work and convince them of your opinion that it's a bad or harmful newspaper.  You shouldn't just try to get a shop to stop selling it.   Well, you can, but be warned -- one day it could be *your* opinions which are considered unpopular and subject to boycotts. 

Lastly - you do realize that pornography is freely available on the internet?  That practically every male (and probably quite a few females) who denounce sexism in the Sun watches (and enjoys) explicit hardcore pornography on their personal computers?

in regards to being more tactically astute,  but my main concern about BR is the same as yours, BR needs to get better at changing systems, most of our players have already played 4-4-2, and that system while playing down the flanks whit our fast pace runners, would create a ton of chances for Balo and Lambert.

But BR seems to be stubborn, he's current system is having problems creating consistency along the lines, to many players fall out of the game from time to time. 

we didn't buy the players that BR's system needed, remember we where having problems whit Lucas not being offensive enough, we needed someone strong in the defensive midfield position, someone whit a good pass and great drive, we got that in Emre, only we fucked up our defensive purchases and where forced to move him to defence, meaning we still lack a decent link between defence and the attacking midfield.

At city, I think of toure and Fernandinho as the midfielders he'd compete with, hendo is better at pressing and more mobile than both though admittedly not as strong going forward, if they wanted a more mobile midfield with better pressing, hendo would earn a spot over Fernandinho, toure is still too good going forward to drop. Lastly at arsenal, wilshere is not very good imo, Ramsey is injury prone, cazorla is geared more towards offense, and I guess you could say coquelin but he plays DM, not a box to box role.

Now, of course, he's removed and so the only barrier should the Treasury decide to try again after OFCOM's review of PSBs is that Channel 4 was Thatcher's pet project (stimulate 200+ SMEs in TV production while smashing the influence of the unions at the BBC and ITV) and some backbenchers therefore view it as the ark of the covenant.

The whole encounter was really awkward though. He asked to come into my house and look around when I said I don't have or need a TV license. I told him he couldn't come in. I'm relatively polite and passive and will go to great extents to avoid confrontation, but I take great pride that this was one of the few instances where I was assertive. 

When he asked why, I told him that I wasn't comfortable letting random people who I don't know who knock on my door into my house. He then asked something along the lines of ""so we're just going to have to take your word that you don't need it then?"" I told him that I wouldn't let a door to door mop salesman come in my house to confirm to himself that I don't need a mop, so why should I let a TV license salesman come in to confirm to himself that I don't need a TV license. 

He wasn't forceful, or aggressive, but I felt he was overstepping his boundaries a bit. I think we were both polite enough that it stayed all quintessentially British, shuffly, and awkward, but I can totally see how the weirdness of such a situation could escalate to the levels seen in the YouTube videos.

My secondary school offered trips about once a year that we were told were partially subsidized (I guess because we were in a poor area?) but I had no idea of the extent, or that other schools didn't have a similar arrangement.

IIRC (Or rather, my Mum's recollection), of the 4 trips I went on while I was there, Chessington cost me £25, 7 days full board adventure trip in Wales was £120, 6 days full board in Barcelona was £200, and 10 days half board in Amsterdam and Brussels was £180 - Though to be fair, for that last one we stayed in a hostel for half the trip, and they only sent two teachers for 40 kids, which had the delightful upside of letting us all get stoned off our tits. I think I split the costs 50/50 with my parents, except for Chessington where I took my half as spending money.

My family wasn't on low income, but most of the rest of the school was and paid less. If anyone had tried to charge £1650 for a trip they would've been laughed out of town.

Nope. We're a firm much smaller than an ISP who log and store what averages as 5 million audit messages per hour. That's averaged out over a week. Those messages are nothing but our from end firewall and load balancer messages. That data load is smaller than out application audit logs by some way. The data load isn't enough to worry about. 

Fine, ISPs don't log anything except exactly what they are required to. There is no way the police could ask an ISP if I viewed a certain URL, it's not possible, can't happen. That is all I'm saying the police need, proof that you pulled a certain URL.

&gt; Then there's the whole legal issue of what constitutes viewing. Does requesting a stream and not playing it mean you've viewed it?

In this case the new laws were written to match exactly that. Receiving any part of the stream is enough to breach the law. You can't save the data to memory and view it later as a get out clause for example. Pulling the data is enough.

I can use chemical sunscreens some days but not every day, the Simple one has stung when my skin was irritated. My rosacea is relatively mild, but it is a lifelong and progressive condition so I need to get this down. Your skin hurting is NOT good. :(

I started my PM skincare routine early today and paid attention to how I am using the melting gel cleanser (amazing what is unconscious!). I warm some in my hand and then quickly and unevenly smear it on different sections of my face/ neck/ decollete.

Then section by section I go back and massage that in. Everywhere had fully melted as I got to that section except my cheeks which were dragging as you said. I just left that part and came back to it. 

I do think the surface temperature of my skin is different in different places, which presumably affects how fast the cleanser melts to oil as well as the oil it is based upon.

Rafa didn't ""inherit"" Ryan Babel - he bought him a year or 2 after arriving.

If you're going to exclude Owen (which I agree with, as he didn't give Rafa much of a hearing despite his pleas to stay), you might also want to exclude Danny Murphy. Didn't he also leave immediately after Rafa's first pre-season?

Plus Rafa shipped Diouf out pretty sharpish (on loan at first, but big Sam bought him the next year)

Bottom line: what Rafa did to win the 2005 CL was one of the greatest managerial triumphs in modern football history. He struggled to come to terms with the change from La Liga to England at first. The team only started gelling after that amazing comeback-from-behind victory away to Fulham in the league (4-2 or something? Xabi's first great game!). And to beat the Italian champions-elect (Juve), the English champions-elect (Chelski), and the defending Italian champs and dominant European team at that time (3 finals over 5 years) AC Milan in the final.

All without our main (at that time) goal threat, who abandoned ship and jumped to Real right at the begining of the season.

Simply amazing. What Rafa did in Europe has never been fully appreciated. 1 win, 1 runners up, 1 semi-final and 1 quarter final in 5 years. At one point, we were **THE #1 RANKED TEAM IN EUROPE !**

And it was always dismissed in England as ""so what, he hasn't won the League, so it doesn't really count"".

Now we take it as triumph just to be allowed to play in that competition ...

Damn those 2 thieving C#%T'S who owned the club, and the vocal minority ""Rafa-out"" brigade amongst the fans. Look at us now.

The single biggest reason why Rafa was so despised in England, by rival clubs, the press, etc - is because he was the one capable of sowing the seeds for a return to long-term dominance.

I watch both leagues, when Real or Barca go away from home to a bottom or mid table side the stadiums are half empty and the teams rollover and the results end up being 5-6 nil. Put that in comparison to the premier league. Almost every game is a significant challenge. Some of our most difficult games last season were against Hull, West Ham, Villa, QPR, and Newcastle away in hostile atmospheres and it's like that season after season in england. Teams play like they're in a cup final whenever they come up against the big clubs in England, even Jose shares this sentiment as he's commented on this exact issue when he left madrid. I'm not saying the PL is a better league then LA Liga, but you don't have to be a better team to win or challenge big clubs in one off games. For example, it's not seen as a guaranteed win when we go to Turf Moor, Stadium of Light, The Hawthornes, The Britannia etc. It's huge news when Real or Barca lose, or even draw AWAY from home.

Agreed. 

I think that this is what's likely to happen, honestly. I doubt the party's going to put forward anyone even approaching anything less than competent for a winnable seat- let alone at a time like this. 

But, frankly- after the Rennard affair's revelations about exactly how the party deals with its female prospective candidates, I think forcing through *some* change is probably a matter of necessity. The party's demonstrated how dysfunctional its internal meritocracy has been- at this point I think dragging the party kicking and screaming into the 20th Century would do wonders for our image. 

I'm certainly not *happy* that this kind of thing is even necessary- it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable as a liberal that it's even being considered. But I don't see much choice, at this point.

There's certainly no shortage of capable women coming before selection committees.

Also, start to talk with your partner about what you might want to be included in a cohabitation agreement - bills, mortgage payments, service charges, chores. Will the agreement be something that you want to stick to if you agree to marry or have children etc? Also, be very clear that if it all goes tits up how things are going to be settled. This way, if you do seek advice you can let your lawyer know what work has been done.

You should both take separate legal advice and it wouldn't be unusual if your solicitor asked to go through some sort of financial disclosure exercise. 

Finally, and this is ALWAYS my advice, make sure that your will provision is up to scratch. 

On the whole, enforceability of these cohabitation agreements can be problematic and piecemeal (unlike the trust deed or will dealing with the ownership of the house).

null,false,AnarchistPostman,null,null,null,"I guess that's true, but still, Ajax are a huge club and I assume they pay the highest wages in the Eredivise. Most young players would presumably join them over most other Dutch teams. The problem is we have 5 teams pooling for talent who are perceived as ""bigger"" than us. I hate Arsenal, but the fact remains that when you're out in London, or playing at Hackney, you'll see many more kids wearing shitty red shirts than the lily white. That populalrity arguably has some effect.

I completely agree with your second point, but nobody really comes close to Ajax in terms of development. You've only really got Barca and maybe Sporting who have similar set ups. Coaching in England is so different for these very young players. Over here, if you pay your money and turn up you can essentially ""train"" in Spurs' academy at like u10. We tend to just let the kids play until they're big enough for full sized pitches. At Ajax it's professional standard. There are 6 year olds doing possession drills. Players get dropped as soon as they're deemed not good enough.

 I think we could learn a lot from Dutch football. The main thing I noticed when I played there is that players are grouped by ability and not age. This has such a big knock on effect in terms of youth development. At 16, I was often playing against teams with 12 year olds who, whilst obviously weaker, were far better than me, and the majority of English 12 year olds. This prevents the best players  from plateauing in their own age group.

It would be great to follow in Ajax's footsteps, but the English youth system is so different and doesn't really get serious until 11+. Also, it shouldn't be overlooked that Ajax were something of a European powerhouse, which obviously helps in establishing a youth set-up that encompasses the whole country and is almost guaranteed to get the best pick of youth talent.

The idea behind this for young players, I think, is that the investment all comes in the early stage of a player's career. If the player is young--meaning he hasn't played with the club long enough--there is no return on investment in the form of impact on the pitch or monetary compensation if they leave young on a free.

null,false,Shoreditchlawyer,null,null,null,"UK Family Lawyer here - Dave the Quaver is wrong, I'm afraid, but only slightly. 

you can appoint a guardian by a will without a problem - you can even have it as the only subject of a will if you want but seems a waste of paper. It's called Testamentary Guardianship and comes into force at the point that every person with parental responsibility has died. In UK, the means you and your wife. 

There is no requirement for the guardians to travel to the UK to claim parental responsibility - they will automatically have it at the point that you die. The great misconception with wills, generally, is when it is and isn't necessary to apply for probate. In short, you don't need a grant of probate to deal with children if you've been appointed as a guardian for a child. If the airline would let them your in-laws here could put your child on a plane to Japan without the sister-in-law ever stepping foot in the UK. 

the issue with which you should be concerned about is making sure that your family here and in Japan are aware of your wishes. Post-death is an emotionally turbulent time for any family and the appointment of a guardian does not preclude your family seeking permission to make a court application in the UK in respect of your daughter. 

Get legal advice as necessary, a family lawyer can advise you about testamentary guardianship and the various benefits/pitfalls in respect of it and a lawyer specialising in wills and probate can incorporate the necessary provisions into a will.

null,false,jmk4422,silence,Silence,null,"Sometimes it's not as simple as that. For example: my house had a broken water line. Called a plumber. Young guys showed up, quoted about $5000 to fix it. Why? Because he would need a four man team to find where the break was. They'd be using fancy video cables (whatever the term is) to snake down through it and then have to jackhammer through the basement's pavement to get to the break. It would be a huge, expensive, all day job.

Decided to get a second opinion. Same deal: younger guys wanting to use fiber-optics and jackhammers, big huge deal, it'd take at least two days to fix. Their quote was even higher than the first.

Finally I called a veteran plumber who's been around here forever. His quote? $500. I asked about the fancy cameras, jackhammers, etc. He looked at me as though I was speaking greek. He just said, ""I have a sledgehammer in my truck. I'll find the break.""

Took him less than two hours. All he did was smash up the basement floor until he found where the line was broken. He cut the line, added a PVC replacement for it, dumped the dirt back on it, then cement. Never had a problem again.

However, there are some caveats to consider.

Selling them (especially if you've not staircased to 100%) is difficult. It will likely be in your contract with them that the housing association that owns the rest of the property gets to try to sell it themselves first of all, for something like 8+ weeks. Expect them to try to sell it cheaper than you might value the property at to get a quick sale and/or expect them to really drag their feet and do nothing with it for those 8+ weeks. Neither of those scenarios is ideal. If they fail to sell it, then you obviously get to try privately, but as you might expect (you're here asking if they're a scam afterall, and you're not the only one who asks or has that opinion) Shared Ownership houses are not as popular as non-Shared Ownership. There's a flat on my estate (a nice, popular one) that has been listed for 8 months now.

You say that you'd rent out the second bedroom. It's not as easy as that. Part of the deal with the housing assiciation you rent from is that you might in fact be ""renting"" with regards to a lot of the clauses of the contract, but get none of the benefits.

Take into account if you do your A2 now you will have to pay to do another test down the line too, also get some insurance quotes on a 125cc and compare to if you got a bike on a A2 licence.

Really?  So a newsagent endorses the ideology of every newspaper it sells?  I don't think so.

&gt;There is no neutral position.

Everything must be political!  Other people's reading choices is now a Party matter!

&gt;No one is making decisions about reading choices.

Banning a newspaper for ideological reasons is doing precisely that!  Yes, I understand the argument that you can still purchase the newspaper elsewhere - but doesn't it bother you that a campus newsagent is *more* restrictive in its ideological range of allowed material than the newsagent down the street?  (That's a rhetorical question of course.  I know it doesn't bother you.  You think it's a good thing.)

As I've said elsewhere - there's no law preventing any of this and I wouldn't wish there to be one.  If students want to limit intellectual freedom then they are free to do so.  Just don't expect actual intellectuals to respect you.

An Egg, pork sausage meat and bread crumbs.  I'm always surprised at how little fat comes off them when they are baked compared to say a sausage which seems dripping with the stuff.  Na Scotch eggs are cool.

**Edit - so I worked out just how evil my scotch eggs are for everyone who thinks the breadcrumbs soak up all the fat...**

There is 3.5% total fat in the sausages meat I use.  (Tescos)  I get a yield of  8 eggs per 375grm serving.

That's about the same as semi skimmed milk (or at least the stuff I buy) Even the wholemeal bread I use to make the breadcrumbs has 2.2% fat in it. I use 1/2 a slice per egg (ish) 

The nasty bit of the whole thing is the Egg which has a whopping 11% fat.  1 each.

I would estimate that each scotch egg will contain 13.85 grms of fat from a daily recommended total of 125grms, so a single home made Scotch egg will amount to about 11% of the recommend intake for a 14-18 year old.  

In actual fact, the fat content will be a little less than this because the meat fat is rendered off the egg over a rack when its baked.

It'll also give some more interesting things to put on your personal statement. Possible downsides are that you may not be able to find something appropriate to do, so get stuck just doing whatever you can to get the money coming in, and having got used to having cash to spend you may not want to go back to being an impoverished student. Also if all your mates have gone off to uni without you, then being left behind doing the 9-5 while they're partying and not getting up til noon may grate on you a bit.

I don't think there's any reason why you couldn't apply in Year 13 and see if you get offers for the courses you want. If you do, all is fine and dandy, and if you don't you could withdraw from the UCAS process and reapply the following year as I suggested. It's just a question of how keen you are to go to specific places, and how much of your time you'd have wasted on the UCAS process if you withdraw and re-apply.

But at the moment, this discussion is kind of academic. Get your head down for your last few papers (NO REDDIT!),enjoy the long summer break, get your results, and then see where you are. You may have done better than you think, but even if you have, remember you're going to need to up your game for A-Levels so you won't get away with it again.
