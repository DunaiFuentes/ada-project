Also there are a number of benefits to the rules being introduced at EU level namely certainty for workers and businesses about the regulation across the EU.

Equally businesses do not need to contend with one set of regulations for each member state and can operate across the continent with one set of policies. It encourages workers and companies to move, live, work, trade, provide services, hire, buy, sell and operate across EU member state borders without having to worry about a spider web of regulation.

Are you drunk? I talked about the Sunday times rich list - it's a 1000 people long. I also mentioned the 590,000 millionaires (up 96,000) but didn't mention the 10,000 multimillionaires(10,000 up 2,500).

Inequality comes from there being MORE people who
are multimillionaires and millionaires whilst MORE people living in poverty (13 million people in poverty in the uk - up 2 million in 2 years)

&gt; Westminster and the Cadogans are only rich because of London property price inflation

Yes they are rich. That's my point. Some crazy future reality where they're not isn't how things are right now. How can you make some bullshit statement like that up and use that to back up your point. If a meteor hits central London and wipes most of the population out things also might change. So might a zombie outbreak.

&gt; Hinduja is a global businessman who happens to be based in the UK but owns most of his interests in India and some in the US

They moved here in 1979. That's 36 years ago! Their HQ is here and they live here. Are you just trying to cherry pick information to make your point look even weaker or are you just a fantasist?

&gt; their wealth isn't evidence of some evil rich people taking money from the mouths of the poor

I didn't say that - you did.

&gt; Inequality isn't caused by 20 billionaires at the top

I also said there were 590,000 millionaires in the UK but you're unable to form an argument against that.

&gt; The super-rich (let's say £100m+) are small in number and have minimal impact on the stats in major countries like the UK.

No let's no use your silly numbers you made up in your head with no research to get things all wrong. Lets use official reports by educated people:

- The Equality Trust: ""The UK has a very high level of income inequality compared to other developed countries - income inequality in the UK has grown at an alarming rate.""

- OECD report: [Inequality is] particularly bad in the UK where the average income of the richest 10% of earners in the UK was almost twelve times that of the bottom 10%

- Oxfam report: UK inequality is increasing at an alarming rate

- Knight Frank report: There are 4,224 “Ultra” families in London alone

- Göttingen and Harvard reports: The rich are causing economic growth to be sluggish the UK is recently notable

- Institute of New Economic Thinking: in the richest countries inequality is increasing massively

- Credit Suisse: Britain is the ONLY country in the G7 group of leading economies where inequality has increased this century.

&gt; The fact is that the UK is a far more equal society than Peru

Of course it is. But why do you have to deal in such petty platitudes for a point to be valid you [low-expectation-having motherfucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0B_ekSrsEk). Multiple research groups and economic bodies have released very recent reports stating that inequality in the UK is ""alarming"", ""massive"", ""worrying"", ""particularly bad"". Why is it that it only has to be the absolute worst place in the world for a point to stand. Do we have to have the worlds highest murder rate before we're allowed to criticise anyone? Peru is a 3rd world country. It has horrible human rights violations, autocratic governments, child labor, a history of civil war, massive unemployment, gender inequality on a huge scale, droughts, social conflicts from British mining companies tearing the environment to pieces.

We are a first world country, one of the richest in the world. We shouldn't have the NHS issuing a report saying that malnutrition caused by lack of food or very poor diet has DOUBLED since 2009.

In the UK as a whole the cost of housing is becoming a significant political issue. Could be a 'bubble', could just be supply/demand; lots of people, not enough houses being built.

I actually wanted de Boer in the summer, because he represented someone who has both managed and played at a higher level than Poch.  He's actually won stuff with Ajax, and taken them to the UCL (recording some good results along the way), and so knows how to work with a young club full of youth academy players who keep getting poached year after year.  Not to mention a playing career that took him to Barca, which as we all know, has proven to be a hotbed of managerial understudies.

Honestly, Poch has been hugely underwhelming this term.  Not sackable bad, but definitely underwhelming.  Unless something big changes for next year, I can easily see him going the route of AVB and getting fired before next season's out.

Mandzukic would be the pick of the strikers. Who else is available? Martinez, Ings, Lacazette, Immobile, etc.

He has many facets to his game that i believe will translate to the rougher physical style. 
Big, tall, strong, physical, aggressive, heading ability, moderately quick, hold up play, counter attacking, assists and finishing. He displayed all this at Bayern when they won the treble but the argument is that he was surrounded by world class players, i think he was more than a passenger in that team though.

He could fit in at Liverpool, maybe a too old but proven quality nonetheless.

The difference is that AVB recorded a record points total for us in the face of a hugely competitive season.  Our rivals have hugely stumbled at times this season, and yet Poch hasn't been able to capitalise.

We won't lose Kane this summer like we lost Bale, but I wouldn't think it unlikely that we'd lose some combination of Eriksen/Lloris/Vertonghen.  And although all three have been inconsistent at times this season, any would be a huge loss to the side.

And if that happens, it leaves us in another place where we once again need to do a heavy recruitment drive in the summer, and one again leaves us with an unsettled squad going into next season.  We'll probably miss out on top transfer targets like Depay, and so have to settle for untested foreigners or good-but-not-great EPL players from lesser clubs.

Poch has shown himself to be inflexible tactically and I think the way he's alienated a huge volume of players in the squad brings question marks over his man management.  They're things that people are happy to ride when you're winning... less so when you're not playing well.

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"I think it's fairly obvious that we don't need any changes to our starting XI after all the guys we had on team of the year. I think the unit that needs addressing is our bench. Obviously a new GK to replace Cech, preferably one who's homegrown. It'd be nice to have another young CB, somebody who's good enough to play in a pinch, but won't mind being 4th choice. I think we really lack a good technical box-to-box midfielder, some who can play alongside Matic in the double pivot, and actually create attacks, who also has a good long shot. Ideally, that'd be Pogba, but I think that's unrealistic. I honestly think this role could be covered by giving a chance to MvG and RLC, and I'd like to see that happen. I think we need another attacking player, who can play all 3 positions who's again, ready to play in a pinch, but not going to get much time. You know Oscar's going to fade in the 2nd half of the year, as he gets fatigued after playing internationally again this summer with Copa America. Maybe that's either Piazon or Atsu, but I wouldn't mind if it was somebody better. Lastly, we need another 3rd striker, Drogba just doesn't cut it anymore. If I could took a drink every time Drogba gave the ball away my liver would be destroyed. 

TL;DR Overhaul the bench, no flashy signings need. 90% of the components are already in play for us to be contenders for both EPL and UCL next year, we just need to get that other 10%, which I think a lot of that could be done either in house or bringing back loanees.

Madrid don't have two world class strikers unless you consider Ronaldo to be a striker and if you do they're playing a two striker system with no depth. Chicarito isn't world class, he's at about Remy's level, possibly worse. Barca also don't really have any world class back-ups to their starting XI, at least once you get past Pedro who is intermittently very good but sometimes poor. Of the two listed only Bayern (who have the best depth in the world without question) and Juventus really have great back ups and even then I'm not sure I'd call Juventus' world class so much as very good. Chelsea probably need another striker but I'm not sure they need to be significantly better than Remy. The attacking midfield problem is also primarily derived from the main wing goal threat after Hazard being Schurrle who left and Cuadrado not being quite ready to step up yet. It's only really the attacking midfield position that need immediate attention IMO.

He seems to think that spending the Bale money (and only the Bale money) would be sufficient to getting UCL football.  It never was.  You can't sell your best player and spend no additional funds on top of that and expect to not just maintain the status quo, but improve upon it.

Having said that, I think Poch was a risky appointment.  He's not really achieved anything as a coach, and he certainly hasn't ever built a long-term system anywhere.  So why did Levy think he was worthy of a five year plan?

Giving him more time is fine, but there needs to be some visible progress in that time.

null,false,TheColinous,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; ONE of the most sensible things I ever learned as a young economist came from my old boss Grant Baird, former Chief Economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

&gt; Reviewing one of my articles which lent rather heavily on the quantitative results of an input-output analysis of the Scottish economy, Grant looked at me wearily and said: “Remember Alex, for most folk anything over a million is just a big number.”

&gt; And so it was and so it still is. Therefore, politicians who believe that you can win a political argument by quoting the latest billion from the latest economic assessment are doomed to disappointment.

&gt; This is particularly the case because many politicians themselves find big numbers tricky. I recall once sending that thoroughly nice man Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, when a Prisons Minister, a friendly corrective note in the House of Commons because he kept innocently mistaking his millions for billions!

&gt; Nor should we expect the experts to be infallible. Last week’s Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report got some fairly simple sums badly wrong. They made elementary mistakes in calculating the effects of both Labour and SNP proposals. They transposed Labour’s borrowing targets for 2020 on to the SNP and they committed a gross unfairness of suggesting Tory, Labour and Liberal estimates from revenue on tax clampdowns were “made up” – but then counted them in for the Westminster parties but not for the SNP!

&gt; In reality, it doesn’t take an Einstein-type analysis to understand that, given the SNP (with our Green and Plaid allies) are the only major party pledged to increase rather than decrease public spending, then there will be more public spending if SNP plans are followed.

&gt; A broader view came from Professor Simon Wren-Lewis of Merton College Oxford. This is not really an individual analysis but part of a broader academic exercise, testing the claims parties made at their manifesto launches. The Conversation website involves more than 30 UK universities, including Aberdeen, Stirling and Glasgow Caledonian.

&gt; It is far from a political exercise, and the professor is not an SNP supporter, but his verdict on Nicola Sturgeon’s assault on austerity was unequivocal: “Nicola Sturgeon’s statement on the economic impact of austerity on the UK is correct, with no qualifications.”

&gt; This exercise is more about real economics than the tax-and-spend process of the IFS. Even if they had managed to get their sums right, the IFS have little to say about economics in the context of policies. For example, in the morally neutral world of the IFS, a tax cut for millionaires carries the same clout as pay increase for low-paid workers. They look at the balance sheet impact of the policy and nothing more.

&gt; But neither real economics nor real people exist in a moral vacuum.

&gt; I made a speech at Glasgow University last week where I pointed out that it was time to reclaim the economics of Adam Smith from the Neanderthal right. Smith, of course, was a moral philosopher at that very university, where he wrote his first great work The Theory of Moral Sentiments. However, we don’t need to rely on that book to understand his moral purpose that underpinned his economics.

&gt; In The Wealth of Nations itself the great man proclaimed: “What improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society can be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.”

&gt; Inequity and the debilitating effects of poverty on human potential are real challenges facing the economy. So are the relatively low levels of productivity and the miserable rate of private-sector expenditure on research and development. Then there is the disastrous lack of capital investment in public infrastructure, the mitigation of which has been one of the great success stories of SNP governance in Scotland.

&gt; These are all things that a move away from public spending cuts would allow to be partially addressed.

&gt; The deficit focus that is required is not just on a Budget deficit but on the deficit of ideas, the deficit of empathy and deficit of imagination which afflicts the Westminster parties and the whole decrepit system that they reflect.

&gt; That requires understanding the difference between real economics and mere tax and spend.

&gt; If, through an alternative economic approach, we can lift both the economy and growth rate by even a small part of a percentage, then the underlying deficit will close. Using rather than abusing human potential really matters.

&gt; The higher output of better skilled people in better jobs will lift productivity, which in the long term is what counts. We need to lift the level of productivity in our tradable industry to secure wealth for the future.

&gt; Finally, a competitive economy requires not only enhanced productivity of labour but improved productivity of capital.

&gt; The move from the disastrous Private Finance Initiative (PFI), so beloved of Scottish Labour, to Not for Profit Trust (NPD) has transformed the productivity of capital in Scotland. We now build better schools for 30 per cent better value than under PFI. Now we need to go much further to build an infrastucture of transport and communications which will do justice to our fundamentally smart country.

&gt; Over the weekend Cameron was embarrassed by not being able to remember the name of his supposed football team. It is interesting to see the Prime Minister exposed as a fake. However, the BBC seemed to think that humiliation was of more significance than the thousands of women who turned out to support Nicola Sturgeon’s message of hope and aspiration.

&gt; In the same way, those caught up in the tunnel vision of tax and spend are mistaking the point of the proper relationship between politics and economics. They are abusing the dismal science to produce dismal politics and a dismal London election campaign. Real economics is about human beings. Real economics which can offer real hope to real people.

You can only do this if you pay that amount into your employers pension instead. Whether or not this is a good idea, is mostly down to the pension deal you have with your employer: https://www.gov.uk/additional-state-pension/contracting-out. This won't give you access to more cash every month, though. 
EDIT: just looked this up again. This option will no longer exist from 6th April 2016. So you can ignore that. 

As has been mentioned, your national insurance is not just health. A large part of it relates to the benefits you'd be entitled to when you retire or when you're unemployed. 

Private insurance generally prices in the fact that you have access to the National Health Service. You can't opt out of the NHS. From what I understand, people don't replace the NHS with private insurance. They use private for access to more cutting edge options (experimental surgeries, etc.), shorter waiting lists and flexible appointment times for long term care (important for business executives, I imagine). With most private insurance, for day to day infections and trauma, you'd still be using the national health service first. This helps keep the cost of private insurance down.

One day, high above Arizona , we were monitoring the radio traffic of all the mortal airplanes below us. First, a Cessna pilot asked the air traffic controllers to check his ground speed. 'Ninety knots,' ATC replied. A twin Bonanza soon made the same request. 'One-twenty on the ground,' was the reply. To our surprise, a navy F-18 came over the radio with a ground speed check. I knew exactly what he was doing. Of course, he had a ground speed indicator in his cockpit, but he wanted to let all the bug-smashers in the valley know what real speed was 'Dusty 52, we show you at 620 on the ground,' ATC responded. The situation was too ripe. I heard the click of Walter's mike button in the rear seat. In his most innocent voice, Walter startled the controller by asking for a ground speed check from 81,000 feet, clearly above controlled airspace.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"But I think there's a bit of a smokescreen around, ""Poch needs to bring in his own players"".  Frankly, I think it's crap.  A manager's job isn't to throw the toys out of the pram and demand new ones... it's to work with what he already has.

Poch was most certainly brought in to work with the under-performing players already in the squad, not sell half the team and bring in a whole lot of new guys, who each will be likely just as risky and require just as much a teething period as the bunch we bought two years ago.  And besides, don't players like Stambouli, Fazio and Davies represent some of what Poch has brought in?  They're hardly ever seen, so why would a big summer recruitment drive prove much different?

The thing is, no manager gets to build his own team from scratch.  Name anybody in the EPL besides Wenger who has had that luxury?  They've all had to work with what they had, tweak and add to it where necessary, but generally look at the parts they have around them and devise a plan to make it work.  Poch hasn't done that.  He's roundly failed at getting the best out of the team except in an extremely small handful of games.

So that's why I'm not super optimistic about him suddenly turning things around next year.  We've already proven to ourselves that buying a whole clutch of new players in one fell swoop is hardly a sure thing, and yet I feel like so many people on here assume Poch just needs to wave his magic wand in the summer and we'll suddenly have a formidable squad.

You're correct that when managed responsibly debt can be a useful tool to increase growth (though personally I don't think it should be used) but it hasn't been managed responsibly at all.

The government has a ""rule"" is that debt should be a maximum of 40% of GDP because, according to them, that is the limit for sustainable investment. We're currently around 80%, getting to the dangerous levels.

Also having debt is only beneficial when the money goes towards investments. The idea is that the GDP benefits from the investment is greater than the cost of borrowing so we can pay off the debt and be in ""profit"". Right now almost half of the borrowing is going towards paying the interest not towards investments. This increases the national debt but provides zero GDP benefit.

Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn’t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren’t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.

Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn’t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

I'm all in favour of paying down the deficit while the economy is growing (rather than what happened in the 90s and 2000s -.-) and using the accumulated goodwill and wiggle room to offset the next recession.

I just take issue with people looking at national finances in anything shorter than a 15-20 year window, which is where the ""Ohs noes the deficit"" crap has stemmed from. A large deficit during and immediately after a recession is to be expected, it doesn't mean the current deficit is inherently bad, as it seems to have done it's job.

To reiterate, it should definitely be paid down now and should grow at some number less than inflation til the next crisis hits. But it's current state is not ""wasteful"".

As for why this is happening, 35 years ago when state housing was sold off and construction stopped, the government did not also remove planning restrictions. Then, millions of people came to live in the UK. In short, not enough houses for the people in the UK.

As for tax, unlike some european countries you pay a lot and don't get much back for it, other than the NHS which is pretty good. There are probably a few expenses you might not have factored into your budget.

Transport costs are some of the highest in the world, particularly trains. You have to pay for water, even if you're renting, and it's not cheap. You can thank privatisation for those.

And here we are again.

First off Jones, my cat is recovering well - he has feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) and was in a very bad way - i won't go into the gory details but no one really enjoyed it least of all Jonesy.  His vet bills are all paid and I won't be withholding treatment from him to sell a couple of sketches. I only really mentioned it to give some context to the drawing - someone bought a commission piece that I'm doing in aid of recouping some of vet bills and helping to pay for some enclosures we're building so he can go outside (he's an indoor kitty which is where some of the problem arises apparently - stress has a big thing to do with it).  So the person who bought the sketch it's her cat that is the one depicted and I gave context because I thought it might be weird to just say here's your favourite timelord with a cat you don't know :)

The government gets money from taxes, and those taxes are dependent on how people get and spend their money. This would be pretty easy to see how much money you'd get back if you increased taxes except for one big problem: the flow of money changes when you change the tax.

This can be seen pretty simply by considering the two extreme cases:

1. 0% income tax
2. 100% income tax

At 0%, the government gets no tax revenue. However, by increasing it to 100% they'd also get nothing.

Obviously, the government does get tax revenue, so that means that as you increase the tax from 0% up you start getting more revenue, then later you'll start *losing* tax revenue.

There's a theoretical side to this, the Laffer curve: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve

Now it depends entirely where we are in this spectrum, it's extremely unlikely that we're at the optimal setting of so many different tax points &amp; values. However, it's actually quite a complex problem to say what'd happen if you increase or decrease different taxes.

I'm sure someone will jump in and say it's about everyone leaving or something like that but it's much more subtle. The problem is not *everyone with wads of dough leaves* but that some people do, or that people don't hire with quite as large salaries but offer other perks instead, or people on £110k don't push as much for that £120k job. While you might think ""well bugger them"" this isn't about morals, you can actually reduce the overall money coming in, which is entirely counterproductive because the whole point is to get more money do do good things.

I'm not saying we shouldn't increase taxes, again we're unlikely to be getting the most in, but it's much more complex than bump up taxes -&gt; swim in proportionally higher monies.",null,0,null,1430124966,null,0,false,0,cqq2nic,null,t3_33wo0k,null,t1_cqq2nic,null,t1_cqpl5j1,null,null,null,1432627690,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

We're fortunate to live in a country where a safety net exists, but all too often (and this article is evidence) people assume the Government should provide for them everything.

It's the responsibility of the Citizen to make their own way in life and to provide for themselves and their family.

I fully support moves to guarantee the Citizen certain protections from the potential ravages of profit-seeking companies. The living wage is a long overdue policy that should have been implemented long ago: that people on the minimum wage require benefits to get by in life amounts to nothing more than a Government subsidy to employers.

The main cause is likely teenagers going on bizarre diets instead of abject poverty.   And I think you miss the grander picture.  A few thousand people suffering malnutrition indications that 99.99% of the country has enough food or more, a staggering achievement compared to just a century ago.  

&gt;We are a first world country, one of the richest in the world. We shouldn't have the NHS issuing a report saying that malnutrition caused by lack of food or very poor diet has DOUBLED since 2009. 
 
Perhaps question why we are wealthy then?  Do you really think you can just 'redistribute' these billionaires' wealth?  It isn't even in the country.  If you try and take it, they'll just piss of to Monaco and no one will benefit.   I truly question what kind of bizarre socialist fantasy land you live in where you think the government can solve this.  The vast majority of these people's capital (with the exception, perhaps of the two Lords and their property portfolios) has never even graced the shores of our fair kingdom.  

That a few groups have said inequality is bad isn't particularly concerning to me.  Inequality can become an issue, but the way to solve it is to raise the conditions of the poor, not artificially attempt to lower the wealth of the rich, which in an age of global capital, is impossible anyway without full global cooperation, something that is a pipe dream on a good day when you're talking about dealing with whale hunting or golfing rights on the moon.  

Have you ever stopped to realise why we aren't like Peru?  The answer is two centuries of stable economic growth, characterised by solid, growing, and relatively trustworthy markets for both equity and debt, and governments which have, with a few tragic and unfortunate exceptions, been relatively supportive of industry and commerce.  

Even the poorest person in the UK is in the top 8-10% of the world.  Do you really think that would stay the same after your socialist revolution?  I doubt it.  The rich would move on, the capital you would seek to expropriate would be unreachable in Swiss bank accounts, and the nation would collapse.   In the end, it is always the working class that suffers most when misguided left-wing movements come to power, and it always shall be.  

Best of luck, though.  I'm relatively fortunate financially, and I can assure you that my Swiss citizenship is ready and primed, and I don't have a single penny in British bank accounts.

Oh, really? Where?

&gt;  With proportional representation, party grandees are put on “safe places” at the top of the party voting list. Why should they bother about their constituents

My constituency is a Conservative safe seat, occupied by the same person for about 25 years. I've had one flyer from that party, no canvassing yet by anyone, probably because no-one else expects to win there. 

With safe seats, why should they bother about their constituents?

As for the EU, I'm interested; but the parties are pretty sure most of the electorate don't want to hear about it, except when it concerns an exit referendum. Details like the day-to-day activity in the European Parliament and what could be re-negotiated in the Union are rarely reported.

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 118 - loss to Manchester City assessed ahead of Everton showdown
Playing against Manchester City is difficult. Playing against Manchester City is even more difficult when you hand over their first goal on a silver platter with just three minutes gone. To gift them two more, well, that's criminal and almost impossible to overcome. Aston Villa did just that at the Not At All Sponsoring Themselves Stadium on Saturday and the manner of the 3-2 defeat leaves supporters with both positives and negatives to chew over.

&gt;In this week's show Chris and Steve assess the performance, discuss Villa's character and vulnerability, and revisit the major incidents from what became a dramatic and frustrating afternoon, including two penalty shouts and the mighty Villa comeback that never was. We also look ahead to the next fixture in the Premier League, which sees Everton visit Villa Park on the back of a 3-0 victory over Manchester United.

England tends to divide itself along regional lines, so it's hard to have an ""English national party"" as a) there's no mechanism of English devolution, b) people from one corner of England often don't have much in common with people from the other corners and c) English nationalism tends to have quite a bad reputation for being linked to the far right.

The SNP and Plaid Cymru were set up to campaign to devolve power to Scotland and Wales. As Parliament is English-dominated it's only recently and with the rise of the SNP that people are calling for English devolution, although we did try it in 2004 but it was voted down in a referendum.

There are the English Democrats (right-wing, slightly mental English devolutionists with a lot of extremist baggage, and who don't stand a chance electorally) and the British National Party (faded, racist successor to the National Front which has ceased to be an electoral force, if it ever was one). You could almost call UKIP an English-exclusive party as that's the only part of the country they're likely to get seats, but they do stand in Scotland, Wales and NI as well.

In Northern Ireland, by convention the ""big three"" parties don't stand, although the Tories have a couple of candidates somewhat hopefully trying to win seats there this time around. They have their own parties instead - the SDLP (republican socialists), the DUP (unionist conservatives), the UUP (unionist conservatives), the Alliance (unionist-leaning non-sectarian liberals) and Sinn Fein (republican abstentionists). The amount of discord and disagreement in Northern Ireland and its politics specifically tends to prevent an NI Nationalist party being created, as the population is split between unionism (remaining in the UK) and republicanism (uniting with the ROI). We spent so long working on creating a separate NI political process under the Good Friday Agreement that I think most people agree that the status quo is satisfactory.

tl;dr English devolution is a much more complicated issue due to bigger and more diverse population than the other UK nations, Northern Ireland has a lot of history.",null,0,null,1430127601,null,0,1430127958,0,cqq37g5,null,t3_340gkz,null,t1_cqq37g5,null,t3_340gkz,null,null,null,1432627952,null,20,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,20,null

Only in the South East in London and in areas within commutable distance. Where I live in the North prices have gone up just 1% over the last half decade. You can rent a 3 bedroom house where I live for £500 a month.

&gt; Worse, interest rates are already high (3 to 4% for a 5-year fixed rate with a 15% deposit, while in my country, it is possible to get a 2.7% fixed rate for 15 years)

Thats actually quite cheap for the UK. Historically the average is around 6%. We're currently experiencing the lowest interest rates in our history. 2.5% and lower mortgages are possible, you just need to shop around. 

&gt; I'm looking for anything deductible that would allow me to lower my huge tax bill. According to the HMRC website, mortgage interest are NOT deductible for a property you occupy, but there are TONS of important deductions (including interest, tax, furniture, repairs...) for buy to let properties. I cannot for the life of me fathom what could be the rationale for such an absurd policy -- how can the UK favor capital income and inflation so much over labour and workers buying their home without causing a riot?

We're not America. We believe that paying taxes is for the common good so we can have things like free universal healthcare. Buy to Lets are businesses so the mortgage interest is counted as a business expenses the same as the interest on a business loan is in the USA.

In the USA an individuals personal tax is more like how we do tax for a business in the UK. The only deductibles from PAYE tax in the UK are certain expenses for your employment such as training courses, membership of a professional organisation, business travel but not commuting.

&gt; In particular, I wonder if it is possible to benefit from the buy to let deductions for a property bought in my home country financed by a local fixed-rate loan?

No it doesn't. The tax relief is for businesses.

Believe me it doesn't. There's a thing called capital gains tax so when you sell the property you'd get whacked with tax, 28% is the rate you'll pay based on your £80k income,  and you get taxed on the profit from your buy to let business, in your case at 40%.

Bertrand - Probably one of our best signings. Absolute quality LB, I was always open to giving him a chance with us and im glad he stepped up.

Toby - Please sign. Nuff said. Commitment to the club and the cause is astounding.

Mane - I think he is a great signing. He just needs to work on staying on his feet. From his POV though, he is unlikely to get anything if he stays up, and he is quite fast and nimble so does get caught a fair bit.

Elia - Not to keen if im honest, bright start but dwindled since, maybe take him on a full loan again.

Djuricic - I think he will quite a good player given the chance and time to play, sadly through injury he hasnt had the chance, I'd definitely take him back on loan with option to buy.

**EDIT** Taider - Yeah he like scored a goal or something for our U21s? Averaged 1 goal a game for us. Great player.

Reed - Not a new signing but new to the squad. Has a lot of quality and work rate, will be a great player for us in years to come.

Long - many people think/thought he cost us too much. While we cpuld of maybe got ""better"" for that price, non of them would have had PL experience like Long. He has won us several vital points, and is a very good impact sub to inject a bit of pace and a tactical change.

Tadic - I dont really know what happened with him, the ability is there he just seemed to forget it... he started off really bright, and hasnt looked bad as of late, maybe its just a case of settling in.

The Man, The Legend, Pelle - Despite his drop in goal scoring form, he rarely had a bad game for us. He never gave up and kept at it for all those games, his hold up play is fantastic, and his command of the front men just shows the type of player he is, and the passion he has for the club, the fans and the game. His badge kiss at the end of the Hull game is something I never expected.

Probably because he doesn't actually make many chances.. he's our 3rd highest at Liverpool and Fabregas, Eriksen, Silva etc have all made far more

All those players also bring energy to the pitch.. and I mean you could argue that Coutinho hasn't had a good striker ahead of him but Hazard's record last season was 14 goals 7 assists and he created 92 chances with Demba Ba/Torres upfront.. and Eriksen also did the same with Adebayor up top. Maybe Coutinho needs a striker to play off more than those do but I'm not so sure.

At the end of the day if we want to be a big team we'll need at least 1/2 midfielders who hit Hazard/Eriksen numbers every season, energy doesn't win you games.. goals do.

Not to mention that just because your house is worth half what it was yesterday doesn't mean you can no longer afford the mortgage as you could yesterday. 

So borrowers will take the hit, but even then, the amount of people who will be in negative equity would be no where near as high as people think. It again will hit those who are new to the house market. 

Say a 40 year old just moved to a 500k house selling his old house for 300k. He bough that house for 150k. 

30% drop brings 500k down to 350k. So overnight he has lost 150k 'wealth'. He could very well be in negative equity. But we forget that he had 150k worth of 'profits' from his first house. 

New to the market haven't benefitted from house price inflation and will be hit. It's unfortuante that they will be hit, but we need to correct the market and that can't be done without some pain.

Hall tutors get larger rooms and a heavy discount on rent in exchange for one or two short stints per week. This could be closing the hall bar, helping with events or just being on call to let people into their rooms. You also get assigned a section of the hall and students might occasionally come to you for advice.

If you can bag one of these places then it is a bit of extra work, but you'll have an instant group of peers in the other tutors and save a lot, and some of the tutor rooms are more like single occupancy apartments. Some are just regular flats though.

If that doesn't work out for you then I think Sinclair House is the main hall for mature students - the accommodation office should be able to point you in the right direction.

The most important factor for me (I chose a 2013 CBR125) was the riding position. I don't know about the older CBR, but the yam and aprilia are both MUCH more aggressive bikes than the CBR I was on. You absolutely can hunch down into a sports crouch and look like a total bellend on the CBR125, but you'd be hard-pressed to get up into a comfortable long-distance position on the other two.

In terms of power, the difference is largely insignificant. The CBR is a little slower, but they're all slow, so whatever, and in return you get a much more comfortable bike. And it's also gonna be much cheaper to buy than the other two.

So as far as I'm concerned, the CBR makes much more sense; cheaper, more comfortable, not significantly slower. The obvious mitigating factor is looks - if you don't like how the CBR looks, that might be enough reason to look elsewhere. Nobody will fault you for that.

The Scottish National party has a skilful leader in Nicola Sturgeon. It has an army of members thought to number around 100,000 in a country of 5m. And it has a chance of winning almost every parliamentary seat in Scotland at the general election on May 7.
What it does not have is a spotless record in government. Among the lamentable features of this election — and there are many, from its parochialism to the sketchy fiscal plans on offer — is weak scrutiny of the Edinburgh administration. The nationalists have been allowed to campaign as plucky outsiders, despite running Scotland since 2007. A closer look reveals a mixed record. Scotland has not been run into the ground and unionists will sound hysterical if they pretend it has. Scots were happy enough to re-elect the SNP in 2011, and will probably repeat the act next year. Still, there is a world of difference between Ms Sturgeon’s rhetoric and her party’s work in office. Two conclusions stand out. The SNP has not governed as progressively as she implies. And in the delivery of public services, it seems to trust the Scottish state more than Scottish people.



The party has made choices at odds with its leftwing pretensions. Spending on the National Health Service has grown more slowly than in England since 2010, which is all the more striking given that the English budget is set by a Conservative-led government. Schools and further education colleges have also suffered financially. As for universities, one of the SNP’s proudest achievements is the absence of tuition fees in Scotland. But even this is effectively a taxpayer subsidy for mainly middle-class students who will go on to out-earn the average Scot. It is a strange priority for a progressive party.



The resources devoted to public services are one matter. How those services are organised is another, and says as much about a party’s instincts. The SNP has shown a taste for centralisation. Scottish schools and health trusts have little of the autonomy that has become common in England. There has been consolidation of police forces and fire services.


Scotland has been largely sealed off from the policy phenomenon of the past 20 years: the trend towards more choice and competition in public services that began with John Major, accelerated under Tony Blair, slowed imperceptibly under Gordon Brown and recovered under David Cameron, the prime minister. The SNP conflate these policies with “privatisation”. In fact, at their best, they empower citizens and give the poor some semblance of the consumer choice that rich people take for granted. Although Scottish Labour can be dirigiste too, the SNP seems to see opportunity and social justice as goodies the central state doles out from its bureaucratic nerve centre.




Ms Sturgeon has run Scotland since last year, and may yet govern differently. She is to the left of Alex Salmond, her predecessor, and more interested in policies other than the existential goal of independence. But if her party is to campaign as the unimpeachable conscience of the Scottish people, its achievements and failures should be subject to audit. The SNP should not get away with blaming Westminster for underfunded and underperforming public services. These are devolved matters. Other Scottish leaders — Labour’s Jim Murphy, the Conservatives’ Ruth Davidson — are trying to draw voters’ attention to the SNP record: the optimistic assumptions about the oil price, the teacher-pupil ratio in schools. Their efforts may not prevent an electoral rout but they must continue and intensify beyond May. The SNP has been allowed to thrive on sentiment and rhetoric for too long.

In theory yes, in practise it varies hugely. Both sides have to agree the window size, just because you request one doesn't mean the sender will increase the window size. You would have to measure your window size and see what it's doing first.

Could be any combination of a number of reasons. Without having the full picture and delving deep into it, there is no simple answer I can give.

Sure but the fundamentals still apply whether it's 20mbit or 500gbit, it's just much more noticable as you scale upwards.

Sorry if it's a bit wishy washy but there are so many variables, it's really difficult to give simple yes/no answers when the reality is a lot more complex. From dodgy cabling, routers/modems, software issues, routing issues, contention, etc... The list goes on.

The TV license is a licence to *receive TV broadcasts from within the UK*. You don't need a TV to do that - you can do it quite well from your computer. Watched live sport on iPlayer? Then you need  a license. If you have a freeview box that is receiving signals, but you don't turn on the screen to watch it? Then you need a licence. In the old days of analogue broadcasts, if you used a VCR to record broadcasts, but never actually watched them, then you needed a license.

OTOH, if you have a TV but you never use it to receive broadcasts, then you don't need a license. So if you only use your TV to play video games, or watch DVDs, you don't need a license.

I've got rid of my TV now, but when I had it, I only used it to watch DVDs. I made sure that it was detuned, and there was no aerial cable plugged into it - or even in the room! When the inspector came, he took one look at my set-up, and OK'd it.

Now, you've got way past the inspector stage. You are in deep shit, because the magistrates tend to believe that there's no smoke without fire. The inspectors will probably say that you have a history of being uncooperative, and that makes you look bad. They might even have evidence that a receiving device was operating on (or perhaps near) your premises - they can detect that from a distance, using their little handheld devices.

You need to find out what their evidence is, and honestly compare it to what the law actually says (hint: what you were doing while your equipment was receiving broadcast signals is irrelevant).

- More Spurs games to watch

- Gives young players a chance

- Levy will continue to invest in a larger squad, we would see cuts if we didn't get in

I've heard a lot of people say if we had a Europa-less season we could give it everything to get in the CL - what's the point of this? It's not sustainable, it's basically what Liverpool did when they challenged for the title. They failed, and now they have extra games on top they can't cope.

Inflation from 1999 to 2012 would have taken that £14400 to £21133, so it's actually gone up slightly.

The 5th percentile would have gone from £8262 in 2012 money to £9570. A growth of £1300.

&gt; (huge amount of money for those people)

Indeed.

Figures for inflation from here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx

Edit -

I've hired cars in several different countries, and I've been using hire cars and trucks for the last 25 years. All they care about is that you've got a license, and that you can put down a deposit. 

When I had my Australian driver license, I could hire a car anywhere in the world with just the license and a credit card.  There's no way they can check my driving record with that piece of plastic.

Then when I exchanged that license for a British one, I had to supply that funny extra bit of paper as well as proof of my address in the UK. Why treat locals with less respect than foreigners?

Do European licenses have extra papers to go with the plastic card?

My kneejerk reaction is to say that there was a quite distinct lack of organisation in preparing for the aftermath than there is today. As far as my memory serves me, getting rid of ~~Jacky Stallone~~ Gadafi was the easy bit, and done with relative ease and also served as a public test run of the Anglo-Franco military alliance... or the future EU army... whatever you want to call it.

Likely, as Libya had spent decades as an enemy, invasion/deposition plans for Gadafi had been on the shelf for a long time just waiting to be rolled out. In this context, the lack of long term plan is remarkably pathetic.

To try and get back to the original point, arranging to bomb Libya and have Gadafi removed was probably not that difficult. 

Also, Id imagine the challenge to getting x number of business leaders to write a letter is timing. I am sure they could get it done eventually, but would it be ready for this supposed perfect moment of deployment in the papers? Probably it would get bounced about from inbox to inbox, held up by someone being abroad and not viewing emails, etc... all kind of small crap that gets in the way. Plus the egos too. Everyone would want to have a fingerprint. etc 

Its obviously easier to have one person write something, show it to the group and get their approval.

null,false,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,null,"That isn't an answer to my question. But I'll indulge you because I'm nice.

The population of Dyfed-Powys is about 500,000, and we had a gun crime rate of [3.2 per 100,000 in 2010-11](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/welcome-dyfed-powys-absolutely-not-gun-2025925). As the article notes, despite being the most heavily armed constabulary population, we have the second lowest rate of gun crime in the country. A more recent FOI request was unfortunately not granted, or I'd have more up-to-date records for the rate, but I don't think it's unsafe to assume that it hasn't changed a lot given that overall crime is declining including, as my *much* earlier link said, [burglary and crimes against the person](http://www.dyfed-powys.police.uk/en/about-us/performance/). I'm not an expert but I'd expect most gun crime to fall within those boundaries.

My view is that guns should only be used by police in situations where guns are already present. I do not think that they offer significant improvements on other methods of restraining a dangerous suspect unless guns are present. [The example of the US demonstrates that the presence of guns in any situation markedly increases the chance of someone being killed](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check). Of specific note is the statistic about guns being snatched from guards.

Let's make the ridiculous assumption, for the sake of ease, that all gun incidents are armed confrontations where the police arrive during a crime in which the perpetrator has a gun. This absolutely is not the case (the police will typically arrive far too late for that), but I am not going to arbitrarily reduce the number of gun crime incidents based on what I think the actual rate of these confrontations is.

So! Based on the 3.2 per 100,000 figure, that means about 16 incidents of gun crime a year. That's 0.0438 a day. All of these are situations, for the sake of argument, where the police being armed offers a real opportunity to minimize harm - dangerous criminals, themselves armed, in the midst of an activity where they are likely to harm or kill. One of these hypothetical incidents only happens a little more often than once a month. Let's call it three weeks. I absolutely do not feel that we need armed police walking the streets to intervene in these astronomically unlikely events. Splitting the day into 3 8hr shifts, the chances of one of these events occurring whilst you're on duty is 1 in 63. And remember, these are gun crimes where the presence of armed police can stop harm from happening, which as I said is very unlikely to be the case given that police presence at a crime scene tends to be 'post facto'.

In the presence of alternative, in my view preferable forms of restraint, such as tasers, I could go so far as to say that having police be completely unarmed at all times would, here, make precious little difference at all.

I actually think the Labour Party needs to recover just by being fucking honest. They need to stop running away from the referendum campaign and proudly defend the union. They should stop being embarrassed by their centrist economics and defend them. They need to make the case for trident instead of ignoring it.

There are plenty of people in Scotland who support all these things. The problem with Labour is that they still think they can win back the core support they lost in 2007 and 2011 when they can't. They are trying to be the party of everyone when that position is no longer tenable. As a result they've become a completely directionless mess without a shred of integrity or principle.

SLab have allowed the SNP to totally dominate all political discourse out of pure spinelessness. The Labour Party turns up to vote for austerity and trident renewal but refuses to justify it, as if we will all just forget. The SNP launches a full frontal assault attacking the very purpose of their party and their response is to ignore it and whine lamely about mansion taxes and zero hour contracts.

If you can get 0% you will still have to pay MSRP, there will be no discounts / haggling. 

If you intend to keep it for a year and sell it on, you will be selling it just after its taken its biggest hit in depreciation. SO the real cost will be 100/month PLUS the lost value on the bike. Made worse if its damaged at all.

If you have to borrow money to pay for a bike, a dealer may not be the best person to borrow from.

Have you looked at getting a bank loan? for say 1.5K and getting a second hand 125 (one that has already taken the biggest depreciation hit). 

I'm not trying to rain on your parade but its really easy to jump into a finance deal because you want an awesome bike (and who wouldn't?! bikes are awesome) but you will outgrow a 125 very quickly and either be stuck paying off a 4K loan or sucking up a big hit to depreciation (or both!).

When I was told (formally) that I had bipolar type 2 I was told face to face by my psychiatrist during an appointment. 

How long you will wait for your appointment will depend on your area and how much mental health provision is available for the population. Some areas it is really quick, in others it's ages. Mental health care in the UK is truly a lottery based on where you live. 

Also be warned, some areas are really really good and others are God awful. Pre-diagnosis I was studying in York and my GP thought I had bipolar and kept referring me to see a psychiatrist. However every time I would see the psychiatrist and then a few weeks later I'd receive a letter telling me they won't help me and they think it's a personality disorder (which was bullshit). This happened 4 times, meanwhile my GP had no idea what to do and I was screwed. 

As a result of my untreated and ever worsening condition I had to move back in with my parents in Norfolk and end my studies. I then saw a Norfolk GP who referred me to their trust's psychiatrist who after 2 quickly arranged appointments diagnosed me bipolar type 2 and sorted out good medication and eventually therapy. I'm a hell of a lot better now, and only alive due to the help I received. 

So it can either be excellent, or atrocious. I hope it goes well for you, but with mental health being cut back all of the time and an increasing population of mental health sufferers it can be difficult to get the help you need.

First of all, there are 4 main things required to make a legally binding contract - An initial offer, unequivocal acceptance of this offer, considerations that go both ways and an intention to create legal relations. 

I would say it is clear that you have the first two sorted. Considerations are basically promises; you promise to pay her £1000 and she promises to pay you that money back. I can confidently say you have satisfied this part too. This is where it gets tricky..

An intention to create legal relations is still needed in every contract, regardless of whether you have the first three. Now, this is what is called a 'social and domestic' relationship (you're friends, rather than businesses, for example), and in these situations there is the legal presumption of NO intention to create legal relations. This means that the duty will be on you to prove that you both agreed to this contract and that your friend knew that it was binding.

You mentioned having terms sorted (£100 per month starting Jan), that will definitely go in your favour as concrete terms point to intention. However, courts rarely find in cases of friends giving money to friends that there has been a contract. 

You said it was done over skype, is there anyway to get a recording of this call? Can you get her to text you admitting that she knows she should pay the money? As it is, you're very 50/50 on which way a judge will decide so before you take it any further (bearing in mind, court is VERY expensive, and will likely cost you much more than the £1000 you're after) I would make sure you can prove that she knew this was a 'real deal'

( this really helps ) 

I digress. 

Basically I went to my GP as I was having anxiety attacks and it was getting me really down, doctor offered me meds which I wasn't into so he referred me and within a couple of weeks I went to a psychiatrist for a general assessment. The general assessment was just a one on one with the psychiatrist basically covering my state of mind, nothing difficult just a general chat and a form filling exercise really.

The referral will be pretty fast if they suspect anything, that's for sure. Especially any kind of depression. 

The psychiatrist recommended either one on one psychiatric counselling ( which I'm not a fan of, I really don't like dragging my past up, and personally I think that kind of therapy for anxiety is useless, I've tried it ) or CBT which I decided to give a go. So they referred my to a local centre for CBT. 

About a month later I started CBT over an 8 week period.

I finished the CBT in December but I have the option of returning at any time if I drift back to a high state of anxiety. They're always on the end of the phone or email. 

I mean, this is my story and I already kinda knew the problem but I assume the general assessment bit will be the same, from there they'll send you onto a relevant specialists who'll take it further, but I highly doubt it'll be a letter through the post telling you what, if anything, is wrong. 

Hope that helps.

I don't think anyone is convinced by Stambouli's efforts, but simultaneously it would be silly to let him go after just one season. Capoue, on the other hand, does not appear to have a place in the team at all, and will probably be sold.

This brings us to Paulinho and Dembele. Dembele hasn't managed to replicate his 2012/13 form and the only thing he's really got going is holding on to the ball. He's strong and skilled with the ball, but unlike Mason he offers nothing going forward. He's arguably been better in a more advanced role, but he still hasn't been a standout performer by any means. 

Paulinho, on the other hand, has done very little of note. Sure, there are glimpses of potential ability, but those are few and far in between, which isn't good enough for a player set to turn 27 in a few months.

Bentaleb - 75: He needs to be a gold.  The only stats that shouldn't largley be in the mid to high 70s are his shooting attributes.  Passing should be bordering on 80, dribbling and physical should be in the 70s, as should his defending attributes.

Danny Rose - 75: Should be a gold.  A bit more pace than the 82 they gave him.  His crossing and passing should be improved a decent bit as well, he's been fantastic in the attack.  Interceptions should also go up, as well as his tackling.

As my reply above stated, the burden of proof is often with the Claimant (the one taking the other to court), however if you have proof that this friend began to pay you back, the judge will likely see this as proof that it was a binding contract. 

As I said, often these claims are not enforced (otherwise you would have people going to court over £10, precedent can be a dangerous thing!) however from the little information I have on your case, I would say it is worth thinking about.

... Unless of course this happened a while ago. Often a lapse of time between the 'breach of contract' and the beginning of legal proceedings will suggest to the judge that you, the claimant, didn't put much faith in the contract (or that the contract wasn't very important to you in the scheme of things) and this can make it unlikely that he will find in favour of your case.

This costs the trust a lot of money and so they desperately avoid a diagnosis where they can (in bad trusts). There is also a lot of symptoms that crossover between a manic/hypomanic bipolar sufferer and an individual with borderline personality disorder. Personality disorders are really terribly ignored in mental health in regards to treatment options, and they'll often tell patients that they can be treated solely through their GP (who aren't trained to deal with it). 

To be honest I think the York services were just terrible, everyone else I knew who had serious mental health problems in York were receiving awful care. 

The problems you've identified sound like classic bipolar to me, particularly if you have problems with depression on top of that. It's definitely worth getting treatment, it's amazing what a difference it makes. 

Also (though it varies depending on location) London is pretty great for mental health in general, so you'll probably be ok.

Re mascara, are you willing to buy from abroad? Because the best and tiniest and most waterproof mascara I've found is Innisfree skinny microcara. It's about £7. Innisfree is a Korean brand, and Asian brands tend to be very waterproof because it's so humid and hot there. I usually take mascara off by soaking a cotton pad with makeup remover, but holding it over this mascara didn't even touch it! It needs an oil remover, rub on and let it soak.

I feel he has often been at fault for goals and has won us very few points (Arsenal &amp; Chelsea are the only games that spring to mind). I hope we sign a new keeper in the summer.


Bertrand - 10/10 - Brilliant player, suits the system perfectly.


Gardos - 1/10 - Seems like a pointless signing, not as good as Yoshida and doesn't really look up to much. 


Tadic - 6/10 - Great start, looked really promising and was linking really well with everyone. Since December he has really gone off the boil and his last few performances have been really below par. Maybe a bit of fatigue after his first season in England? I hope so. He also has a great link with Bertrand and they work really well together on the left.


Elia - 3/10 - Great start against Newcastle but has done nothing since. Looks a bit of nothing player. Fairly skillful but has no end product and doesn't look like scoring or causing damage very often. Should we get him on a perm? Maybe, could be good in Europe and I hear the fee is quite low. 

Djuricic - 1/10 - Might have been different if Kevin Friend had any balls but as it is he hasn't really done anything. If I remember correctly it is £10mil+ to take him permanently so it seems like a waste of time getting him on loan in my opinion.


Shane Long - 7/10 - I love Shane Long, the work rate and commitment is great. Always willing to play out of position and has been involved in some key moments. Bit disappointed by his lack of goals but I feel he is a great option to have. 


Sadio Mane - 9/10 - Tough start, but since Christmas he has really turned it on. Undoubtedly one of our best players since boxing day and has won a lot of points with his goals and *ahem* methods. I am a big fan of his and when operating off the striker, as he has done recently, he is very effective.


Graziano Pelle - 10/10 - What a signing. Perfect replacement for Lambert. Great work rate, great fitness and never gets injured. Although the goal scoring dropped between December and April his hold up play and performances in general were still excellent. I am a massive fan of his and think he will only get better next season.


Toby - 9/10 - What a player. Shame about a few of the injuries but clearly a top CB. When him and Fonte are together we hardly look like conceding.

null,false,RyanTerra,null,null,null,"There is no official letter of diagnosis, or any other formalised way of saying ""this is what you have"" beyond a note on your medical records which will contain *suggestions* by a psychiatrist.
 If you try to press them for a specific condition you will find them evasive. The word ""possibly"" will be used a lot.
 
 There are lots of reasons why that is the case. One is that they don't want to label you, labels are harmful. They can cause you to be stigmatised and marginalised by others, and often the label becomes internalised by the sufferer, which means they begin to identify and define themselves by it. Some sufferers internalise to the point they become offended and angry if alternative diagnoses are suggested, or if the doctors say that they are in recovery. They cling to it, it becomes a center for their personality and a valuable scapegoat for all their problems. When I was a teen I treated my schizophrenia as if it was some kind of twisted badge of honour.
 Another important aspect is that mental health conditions are fluid and changing, and treatment needs to be that as well. If you stick someone in a box with a defined protocol, it becomes harder to treat them when circumstances change. 
 
 If you are suffering a long term mental illness then you will hear many different diagnoses and opinions from various mental health professionals over the course of your life.
 The modern approach is not to treat a specific disease according to the criteria of a medical journal, but to target and address the specific ""symptoms"" that are causing you distress and problems in your life, and this is likely how your psychiatrist will proceed. They will ask you, what aspects of your thinking and behaviour are disruptive to you and others around you? And then they will use the tools available to chip away at each thing you list, with the goal of improving and maintaining your quality of life. 
 
  My advice to you as someone who has suffered a psychotic disorder for many years is to not focus on being diagnosed, on getting that label and boxing yourself, because that's the first step to an unhealthy approach to whatever problems you suffer from. I've seen people in psych wards *demand* they be allowed to stay. They're *sick*, they can't *leave*. They want to be ill.

Legacy: Invaluable to the show. People will dismiss the plots and individuals as terrible, as so often is done on the show, but I think people often miss the masterpiece that are RTD's characters and there development. Rose started out feeling hopeless and worthless for just being a girl working in a shop, and left knowing the beauty and extent of the universe, feeling like life was an adventure, and you must do whatever is right, and fight for a better life. Martha started out weak as a girl swooning over the Doctor. By the time she left, she had realised how silly she used to be, had hardened, and become someone ready to fight, and not just roll over and surrender. Donna is the best development imo, she went from a hopeless woman with no real meaning in her life, to someone wise, kind, and compassionate, all to just be torn down by what is imo the saddest event in the entire series. And obviously, the Doctor went from a guilty man who had committed genocide, to a hero who believed in saving life and seeing the beauty of the universe again, but still with an inner sadness after all he had lost. These masterpieces of characters had many great cornerstone scenes for their development. To list some scenes that had great effect on character development: Rose seeing the world burn [The End of the World], Rose's father dying [Father's Day], Rose breaking open the TARDIS to save the Doctor [The Parting of the Ways], Reinette never seeing the universe [Girl in the Fireplace], Rose being sealed away forever [Doomsday], Doctor telling Martha about how the Time Lords had died [Gridlock], The Death of the Master [Last of the Time Lords], Donna crying at the power of the Oods song of captivity [cant remember episode name], the scene where the Doctor recounts all the people who had died in his name [Stolen Earth], Rose kissing the human Doctor as the Doctor sadly walks away and dematerializes, forever[Journey's End], the Captain dying[Waters of Mars], and finally, my favourite moment, the Doctor sacrificing his life, to save one final life[The End of Time P2].

TL;DR: I can't fit how much I adore RTD's writing into a readable paragraph.

&gt;***Are Scottish &amp; Northern Ireland banknotes ""legal tender""?***
In short ‘No’ these banknotes are not ""legal tender""; furthermore, Bank of England banknotes are only legal tender in England and Wales. Legal tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to the settlement of debt. If a debtor pays in legal tender the exact amount he/she owes under the terms of a contract (and in accordance with its terms), or pays this amount into court, he/she has good defence in law if he/she is sued for non-payment of the debt.

&gt;In ordinary everyday transactions, the term ""legal tender"" in its purest sense need not govern a banknote's acceptability in transactions. The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland banknote as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved. If both parties are in agreement, Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes can be used in England and Wales. Holders of genuine Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes are provided with a level of protection similar to that provided to holders of Bank of England banknotes. This is because the issuing banks must back their banknote issue using a combination of Bank of England banknotes, UK coin and funds in an interest bearing bank account at the Bank of England.",null,0,null,1430148293,null,0,false,0,cqqatji,null,t3_3414zy,null,t1_cqqatji,null,t1_cqqapl4,null,null,null,1432631611,null,15,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,15,null

Ask any Dortmund fan about how much they credit Doll for rebuilding them again to a German football powerhouse, I doubt you'd find many (if any) people who'd agree with you there. Doll got Dortmund almost relegated, they qualified for the UEFA league via the domestic cup final. A nice domestic cup run is nice, but if you are shit in the league that doesn't really matter much (if you don't win the title). Klopp was the first in years to get Dortmund qualified for European football via the league, let alone the Champions League where Dortmund played for the first time since 2002 (I have no idea why you think Dortmund played CL football under Doll)

In 2005 Dortmund finished 7th, in 2006 7th, in 2007 9th and in 2008 13th. Then Klopp took over. Looking at that it doesn't seem to me that the rebuilding of Dortmund into a German football power was really in the swing of things before Klopp came in

Selling the naming rights to the stadium in 2005 was a necessary move considering the bad financial situation of Dortmund, but that didn't really put them in a better situation when it comes to the budget for the team. They got 4m € per season till 2011 for that, and that money almost completely went into paying off some of the debts.

You enjoy and like his music too. But, recently you found out that on some Saturdays Danny Brown will watch, and even support, Arsenal on TV.

And now you can't enjoy the music he makes as much anymore?

&gt; Do our police, facing gun-toting drug dealers, pay the price of a historical legacy of minimum force? Probably not: the vast majority of the world's police forces are armed and the murder of, and attacks on, the police vary enormously from one jurisdiction to another. It seems pretty clear that arming the police has little effect on their safety or on crime levels generally. 

The article was written by a reader in Police Studies at the University of Reading. There is ultimately no compilation of statistics that I could find which quantifies police armament and compares that to crime rates and the frequency of firearm discharge.

There are however several compelling arguments against police armament. I don't know whether you have access to academic resources, but I do, and [this](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1043946032000105381) article was a study on police armament in Sweden and Norway. The abstract is as follows:

&gt; The present study investigates police use of firearms in two Scandinavian countries. The Swedish police force is regularly armed, whereas Norwegian police are armed under special circumstances, and only by order of a police chief. Data were collected from reports of firearms use to national police authorities. An inspection of shooting incidents showed that close range assaults with knives on police increased the probability of eliciting shooting, as compared to other threats. In addition, such assaults increased the probability of injuring a suspect as well as a firing officer. A central result was that Swedish police shoot more often than Norwegian police and, in addition, more police and citizens are injured in Sweden. The relation of these results to firearms regulations is discussed.

Anyway, I'm going to leave it there, else it'll become, essentially, a real research project where I have to trawl through hundreds of academic papers, and that's the point at which reddit stops being entertainment and starts being work.",null,0,null,1430150375,null,0,false,0,cqqc3d8,null,t3_33wxmi,null,t1_cqqc3d8,null,t1_cqq8j8f,null,null,null,1432632210,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Voting helps perpetuate the voting system and thus actively does harm to our democracy by perpetuating a semi-democracy. 

If no one participates, there is no voting system. Therefore the credibility of any given voting system scales in relation to the level of participation. If the level of participation is high, it lends the voting system credibility, but if it's low, it hurts the voting systems credibility. It's far easier to argue FPTP should be scrapped if it has a 35% turnout than if it has a 90% turnout.

It's essentially the same idea as voting with your wallet, but with votes. I think most of us recognize that companies are far less receptive to customer complaints until it starts to affect their bottom line. If you threaten to cancel your service, subscription or whatever, most companies will suddenly go ""woah, hang on now, lets not be hasty. Maybe something could be worked out"". Similarly, political parties will keep on keeping on until they start to lose votes. This is the very argument he uses to justify voting for smaller parties or spoiling your ballot. If they stop getting your votes, they want to win them back and adjust accordingly.

You can apply the same thing to the voting system. If you continue to plug votes in, it has very little reason to change. You're doing what it requires to succeed. As such, it is nigh-impossible to vote in a way that will harm first past the post more than it will help it, because merely participating helps prop it up more than it contributes to tearing it down. There is one exception which is specific to FPTP however and that's hung parliaments. If you're in a contested seat and you can help someone win that makes a hung parliament more likely, you should absolutely do so (according to current polls, reducing tory seats seems to be desirable to that end). This is because FPTP aims to avoid hung parliaments and thus they damage its credibility along with low turnout.

This even refutes his final point that if the country is being piddled up the doo-wap by a prime-minister you hate and a political party you can't stand, you can at least shrug smugly and claim no responsibility, because actually it is, on account of having raised the likelihood of the same thing happening in the next election.",null,0,null,1430150751,null,0,false,0,cqqcbpo,null,t3_340nd3,null,t1_cqqcbpo,null,t3_340nd3,null,null,null,1432632320,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

My wife and I spent four or five years living in Cotham and over the other side of whiteladies in Clifton (renting) before we decided to buy.

We did lots of random late night drives to scope out places and I remember doing the straight line of Stoke Bishop (oooh nice, but too expensive), Seamills (looks a bit ropey), Shirehampton (looks a bit weird) and Avonmouth (no thanks). Totally unfair technique but it seemed like a good idea at the time.

The thing is, we saw a house for sale just off shirehampton high street and went to see it on the weekend (during the day), and just instantly loved the place. It is a proper working-class village, with nice people living there and all the shops you could need. I agree that the Coop monopoly isn't great, but you can be in Cribbs in less than 10 minutes which has Asda, Marks and Morrisons; or if you feel poncy like me you can head to Portishead Waitrose in 10 minutes.

The place has some rougher edges, definitely, but I have never felt unsafe. On one occasion my neighbour clocked a dodgy bloke hanging around (clearly looking to rob), but within a few minutes  the local police were driving by and the guy disappeared (this has only happened once).

I wouldn't dare go near the lifeboat pub, but the lamplighters is lovely (even if I expect the music to stop when i walk in, as it is very much a pub where everyone seems to know each other).

Importantly, it is quiet. I loved living in Cotham, but the massive expansion of student lets around where I lived meant that the noise levels were getting worse (as I got old and boring), and they took no responsibility for things like bins, clean pavements, clearing up mess etc. I never thought I would utter those words, but I am clearly becoming the old man I promised I would never be. Ah, screw it.

In shire at night, I can have the windows open and I won't hear a single thing, other than the occasional owl.

To sum it up, it is local, working class and friendly. The shops are there if you need them, but you will probably find yourselves making use of the transport links and going further afield. You can be at Clifton down by car or train in 10 minutes, or the centre in 15 via the portway.

Importantly though, the prices for houses are reasonable.

Hope this brain-dump helps a little. Message me if you need more info.

Around here it's pretty much all overhead, apart from the new estates where BT is already doing FTTP (and in some of the overhead areas they've done FTTP too). And any blocked conduits from pole to exchange are going to need to be fixed to get the fibre in place for G.FAST. I would hope that where possible, BT goes for FTTP and reserves G.FAST for the truly troublesome areas.

The people who like to keep saying ""FTTP is too hard, too difficult"" haven't seen how much FTTP BT is already doing in Cornwall, and where they've done it - from town centres to rural farmhouses

&gt; And blowing, splicing and terminating fibre they're finding is taking 1day+ of engineer time, which is just un-sustainable.

They're going to have to do it anyway for G.FAST. Using PON, instead of plonking a DSLAM on the fibre, you install a splitter instead. The remaining connection to the home doesn't need a fibre splicer or complicated engineering work, IIRC. And if fibre became the medium of choice, economies of scale would bring equipment and labour costs down anyway.

&gt; At least with G.FAST they can blow a load of fibre at the same time and then push the data over existing infrastructure.

The costs really are not that radically different - and I think in time we'll see that FTTP becomes the preferred solution where feasible due to its overall simplicity and true futureproofability.

&gt;Since the IFS wrote their report both the Westminster and Holyrood governments have announced increases in NHS spending and the rate of inflation has dropped.

&gt;Taking this into account the IFS now conclude that English health spending has increased by 6% in real terms between 2009-10 and 2015-16 whilst Scottish health spending has gone up roughly 1% in real terms in the same period.

&gt;The IFS says you cannot compare ""NHS Scotland"" figures with figures for the UK Department for Health as they exclude things like primary care, dentistry, training and would therefore not be comparing like-for-like.

&gt;So in conclusion health spending has increased in Scotland but by less than in England. This is in the context of Scotland having to make fewer cuts overall than have been made in England.

This could be an argument against belief driven politics as a whole; if you have a view left or right of center, you're clearly too biased to make informed decisions and ergo should not be in a position of power. 

&gt;However, it is inappropriate that the health minister have blatantly false, disproven beliefs which he uses to inform public policy for the entire country.

To be frank, his argument in this case isn't that bad; he takes what is a recorded phenomenon (adoptive parents are more likely to abuse their children than non-adoptive parents) and turns it into a half truth (Homosexual couples are more likely to adopt children, ergo abuse can be expected to be more prevalent with homosexual couples). Obviously he twists this into the unsupported 'as such homosexual couples shouldn't be allowed to adopt' to fit his viewpoint, when really by this logic you would have to ban adoption outright. A bad argument, but not as bad as ones like 'Global Warming is a myth', or 'Vaccinations cause autism', which can be seen as utterly untrue in every sense.

RVP, United – Poor from Fonte, but this was such poor keeping - http://gfycat.com/WigglyDelectableHeron 

RVP, United – It gets worse, no way should this beat him -http://gfycat.com/SecondThoughtfulAfricanparadiseflycatcher 

Barnes, Burnley – Again, how? http://gfycat.com/HappyMilkyHairstreak 

McNulty, Sheffield United – Absolute clanger.

Chamakh, Palace - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30966193 

Shelvey, Swansea - http://gfycat.com/ClassicScholarlyGalah - Great shot, but shouldn't be beaten there. 

Sterling, Liverpool – Again under him - http://streamable.com/tx7u 

Coutinho, Liverpool – Yes, great hit. But at 6’7 should you be beaten by a 35 yard shot that isn’t in the corner?

Costa, Chelsea – Should have caught the cross.


These as individual mistakes are not too bad, but when you put them together it leaves questions. Every goal keeper makes mistakes and gets beaten when he shouldn't, but Forster seems to have it happen too often.

The one thing you should be aware of is that you lean very far forward. I don't have a great back so after half an hour it hurt like hell. 

It also has a poor turning lock, which makes filtering more difficult.

On the plus side it looks incredible, best looking 125 in my opinion. 

Also, perhaps a surprising plus side, I think it's very good practice for when/if you move on to larger bikes. This is because for a 125 it's fairly wide, so you get used to the shape of it, also while the steering lock is poor for a 125, it's actually not so far off the lock on a large bike. Basically I think it feels as close as you can get to a 600+ on a 125 while also being more unstable than a 600+. The result is that when you come to do your Mod 1 you will find it dead easy!

EDIT: I just read your previous post. It's IMPORTANT you decide whether you do want to move on to larger bikes or not. If you do, then yes go for a manual bike now. If you aren't sure or you don't want to then I would say definitely get a scooter. This is because a 125 has to be in 3rd gear by the time it gets to 20mph. That means when filtering through traffic you constantly have to worry about changing gears, which makes it harder to pay attention to your balance and to the traffic around you.

Your MP may have a high cost but if they also attend Parliament and vote often this will impact their ranking. We also provide a commons average for some of these - so you can see if an MP is above or below average. 

We are not claiming this is a better view of MPs than any other - far from it, however, it is a different perspective on your former MP - and we will be adding in the ability to compare the new MPs with the former as a benchmark after the General Election.

If a local authority disagreed with those priorities, tough.

null,false,SpecialPudding,null,null,null,"Hi, Well done on getting the job.

If you are living with your mum, and she is claiming housing benefit, she will need to tell the council about a change in her circumstances AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. The change in this case is that someone whom she lives with is now earning a wage.

You need to do this because your wage, now that your working, might affect what benefits she is entitled to. The reason I recommend contacting housing Benefit ASAP is that, if you leave it too long, or don't notify then within a reasonable time, they may try and claim back overpayments they have made to your Mum or even sanction her claim. This could cause rent arrears or financial difficulty, so it is important to keep housing benefit updated to any relevant changes. This also goes for other benefits as well.

Here is the Wirral Council page on dealing with changes in circumstances: [Wirral Council Housing Benefit: Change in circumstances](https://www.wirral.gov.uk/my-services/advice-and-benefits/benefits/housing-benefit/change-circumstances) 

There a list of the changes that Wirral council need to be notified of (Including ""Your income, or the income of anyone who lives with you, goes up or down"" which I think is relevant to your circumstances.)

I would strongly advise making an appointment to see someone at the council housing department if possible to talk though your situation. It might also be a good idea to pop along to your local Citizens Advice Bureau with your mum, As they will be able to offer appropriate support and advice around your families circumstances, including other benefits your mum claims and how your income may effect it - it sounds like your income could vary from week to week.)

Wirral CAB: [http://www.wirralcab.org.uk/](http://www.wirralcab.org.uk)
CAB Advice Line:  0344 477 2121

Don't let this put you off or worry you, you did good to get into work, and if you do things by the book I would hope it won't have a huge impact on your mum's circumstances, you just need to tell the council about changes to your circumstances to avoid the penalties associated with not informing them. 

Good luck! :)

have to agree, bertrand is a very solid player who BR did want originally, but you have to think that its 1 part bertrand, 1 part koeman and 1 part the rest of the back line. what those proportions are, i don't know, but what i can say is that bertrand didn't come in and make that defense look a million times better, he came in and performs a similar role to shaw. with that said, i think the defenders in the team (clyne and fonte) are the real driving force behind what makes their defense so bloody good and i think the southhampton system really drives players like alderweireld and bertrand on to another level. bertrand very solid player, and i would have been perfectly content signing him last year, but we got another (younger) great prospect in moreno who i truly believe can be challenging for a spanish national team birth in a couple of years.

If you pay 40% tax you can sacrafice 60p of take home for £1 contribution to your pension.

If you have any form of employer contributions or top up then the benefit of pension contributions is amplified. The key cost of course it these funds are locked away until at least 55yo

In contrast, putting into an ISA is after tax. You have already paid 40% on that money before putting it in. Once in its just the earnings that are saved from tax. And with 11k tax free capital gains and (soon) 1k tax free interest that benefit is not as big as it seems.
