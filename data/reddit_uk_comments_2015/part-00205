I wasn't always an atheist. I've changed my views through research and my own personal experiences throughout life.

I think they are a little less shallow than that, these are professional people earning tons of money - and they see the EU as a massive positive in their lives. Many of them would rather contribute to the EU than to a country which abandoned it instead of using its power to change it. Getting a job elsewhere will be easy, they chose the UK as it was the best place in the EU to get a good job - if it leaves, onwards to Germany, Holland, Ireland, all places where they can be employed with similar salaries.

&gt;Do you not think your company would benefit Britain making its own trade deals to the whole world increasing your market in the long run?

No, I definitely don't. The whole reason countries like China and the USA love the EU is it lets them negotiate one lucrative deal, instead of lots of small deals. 

There is zero evidence the UK will negotiate deals better than the EU - look at it this way, Tesco's small suppliers get royally fucked by Tesco because they need Tesco more than it needs them, but its big suppliers can throw their weight around, because it's a mutually dependant relationship.",null,0,null,1433107802,null,0,false,0,crr6rw4,null,t3_37y7md,null,t1_crr6rw4,null,t1_crqvs5h,null,null,null,1433503737,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Barlinnie was a holding jail with a mixture of short term and long term prisoners. The very short termers mostly completed sentence there and those with longer terms moving on to either lower category jails or long term jails. In 98 when I was there the cells still had no toilets and had a pot to piss or shit in which you emptied in the morning. It was a grim 100 year old plus building pretty much identical to what you'd be familiar with in Porridge. The PO's ranged from the half decent to the shit but then to be fair the crap they took from a lot of inmates breeds it. I was fortunate enough to get a ""pass"" job, little bit more time out of cells, doling out prisoner clothing, taking stuff to and from laundry, helping with meals and cleaning etc. For short timers there was little or no attempts at rehab, for the drug addicted guys they were left to go cold turkey if they hadn't managed to bring stuff in with them or had the funds to get stuff inside. The methadone guys were the worst, no methadone was prescribed and withdrawal from it is even worse than heroin so they suffered or went back on the illicit stuff inside. Quite a few died on release, used to low quality or nothing in jail and not having their problem addressed  they'd go out and hit up at the doses they were used to before they came in and promptly overdose. 

Time in Barlinnie was harder than in Kilmarnock, short termers were a pain in the arse, needy and moaning about doing thirty days or a couple of months to people who could be doing years, a fair proportion of them would be in and out multiple times a year. One old lad would deliberately get himself rearrested on release as prison was all he was used to. Guys doing longer sentences were generally calmer, had more to lose in terms of loss of remission and just wanted to get to a lower category jail as soon as possible.

I was moved to Kilmarnock, Scotland's first privately run jail, right after it opened. The group I was taken down with were amongst the first couple of dozen inmates and the contrast with Barlinnie could not have been greater. Cells had built in toilet and sink, better ventilation and heating and some power sockets for a kettle and radio, Barlinnie had no in cell power. 

I snagged a job in the library and was involved in the set up, fairly interesting stuff and I stayed in there for my first 6 months of my stay. Staff were in experienced and it was a lot less intensively staffed than Barlinnie but the jail design made it possible. Central control point with 4 blocks running off each in spokes. Blocks had a pool and table tennis table, decent central tv, until late on in my sentence tv's were introduced to each cell, selection of games, decent areas for sitting and eating with fellow inmates and a decent exercise yard. There was also really good access to a well equipped gym and sports hall. In general the difference in attitude between the private jail staff and POA staff was night and day. Lot more respectful, although with clear boundaries, approachable and generally human. There was some classes on offending behaviours, anger management, drug and alcohol behaviours and even some ono on one counselling options. 

I was in the section for prisoners doing sentences of 4 years or more, known a long term sentences, so mixture of lifers, although generally only those well into their sentence, the induction unit at Shotts dealt with those only just sentenced to life or very high tarrifs, people with sentences for rape, serious violence, serious robbery assaults, those caught with large amounts of class a drugs etc.  

A real mix of people from those for whom a long term sentence was jsut the culmination of a criminal career to those there after one devastating incident. 

Another feature of Kilmarnock was payments for work at a much higher rate than in the government run jails. In the metal work shop you could earn up to fifty quid a week, which I did for a bit, and £30 in the cooks, which I also did. By the time I was released I had managed to save nearly £1500, most prisoners in state jails are were released with a weeks giro.   

I was pretty fortunate. I had no drug or alcohol dependency going in so didn't need to indulge whilst there, generally the things that will get you involved in shit whilst in there I was outside. I'd not been involved with any gangs so didn't get involved in any of the crap related to that. Got on reasonably well with the many pretty normal people I came across, stood my ground when necessary and got out the way when it was smart. By and large people are just looking to get on with their sentence and get out. 

Jails are places of contrast, there's a lot of sadness and desperation, worry about family, wives, kids on the outside and stress through powerlessness. Lots of guys turn to drugs to ease the passage, others throw themselves into fitness or hobbies. For me it was books, I've always been a voracious reader so access to a decent library helped a lot. There's also a huge amount of laughter, lots of very sharp cookies in there, great storytellers and wits. A lot of guys will have lived life on the extremes to end up there and this produces lots of comedy gold. It never quite masks the reality of where you are but oils the passage of the days which are largely a series of repetitions with those with determinate sentences doing an internal countdown to a potential release date. 

What did I learn whilst in there? That for many of the short termers it's just one part of the cycle in a chaotic lifestyle, jail does nothing but get them off the streets to stop being a nuisance for a while, if they're unlucky they'll die shortly after release, if they're lucky they'll get longer sentences to the point were they just age out of the behaviour. For a lot of blokes low level crime is something they just eventually grow out of and jail never really factors into the equation as a deterrent or solution, indeed the criminal record just acts as a barrier to them getting out of the cycle sooner.  

In the longer term jails there's some attempt at rehab and from what I saw a lot of the guys took it seriously and engaged. Whether or not it had any great impact after release I couldn't say. How long is long enough when it comes to sentencing to act as a deterrent. I've no idea, I know in my own case I wouldn't have repeated what I did without a single day in jail, being aught and the impact that had on family and friends was enough for me to sort myself out. 

There are some seriously bad people in there and some who I feel quite happy labelling that way. Rapists who never showed an iota of remorse, murderers with not much awareness of the impact of what they did or for whom it was just part of business. But the majority were just pretty ordinary people who made some seriously shit decisions.  

15 years after getting out I almost feel like it's something that happened to someone else, they've told me all about it but I can't quite believe it relates to me. 

The impact is still very real though. I managed to have a pretty decent career after release, I was a graduate, had some well positioned loyal friends and it was prior to the almost ubiquitous crb checking that happens now. After a redundancy in 2010 I found it almost impossible to get rehired anywhere. Disclosure is mandatory in Scotland for those with long term sentences and it doesn't expire, there is some consultation ongoing that those with 4 year or under sentences will expire after 10 years but it's yet to become statute. So you have a choice between declaring on your application with a letter explaining the circumstances and what you've done since or not declaring and risking exposure, dismissal and a potential further criminal conviction. It's ironic that I had fewer problems being hired immediately after release than I do now with a 10 year management history post release and 15 year history pre sentence. 

Anyway this is fast becoming a TL:DR. I broke the law, seriously scared some people just doing their job, stole cash, and caused a lot of bother for the authorities. The biggest learning point was I was a complete cock for doing it.

For starters, I think Remy proved he's an adequate backup, his goal per minute ratio I think was higher then Costa's in league this season. Benteke would be extremely expensive for a backup player. I think there are 2 areas that we need to strengthen, and that we will. I think we need to get another serious goal threat, somebody who can play along the attacking 3 behind Costa, and who has versatility in playing anywhere along there. As you can tell by my phrasing, I'm leading to Griezmann. He'd be a fantastic addition, since he'd improve on our starting XI, whether we have him play centrally, or on either wing, we could go Griezmann-Hazard-Willian, Hazard-Griezmann-Cuadrado, or my personal favorite Hazard-Oscar-Griezmann. It would also mean the end of Fabregas at the No. 10, which myself and many other fans would enjoy since we'd have Oscar, Willian, and Griezmann who would be better options there.

Education is necessary for society. And I'm not sure there's an upper limit on when adding more education stops being useful.

It also seems to me that you're conflating two very different questions.

a) Should we pay for people who want to change their degree?

and

b) Should society pay for higher education at all.

If we were to fund higher education via a grant system, I can't see why on earth we wouldn't let people change degrees.

If you want to argue that we shouldn't fund education at all, that's a separate argument, and the question of whether Joe wants to do history now rather than geography then becomes a non-issue.

I.e. I suggest there are really three positions here:

a) We don't fund higher education.

b) We do fund higher education but we don't let people change mid-flight.

c) We do fund higher education.

I don't think b makes any sense at all. It just seems cruel. And, in a discussion between a and c, I'd plump for c. The more people who are educated, the better it is for everyone.

Last year, we had the SAS, the two best performing strikers in the Premier League, and finished 2nd. This, to anyone with an IQ which is a higher number than their shoe size would be considered an anomaly. Football teams do not regularly finish around the 5/6/7 mark and then miss out on the league the following year on the last day.

Obviously we then sold Suarez, and needed to buy several players, because with an increased work load, the 14/15 players good enough to be in the first team was not enough, we needed an actual squad. We were never in a million years going to sign any huge names when we needed a good 10 players, people seem to not understand this.

Then, no one could ever have expected Sturridge to miss nearly the entire season. However, in a season where many players underperformed, and we were playing a team of a GK, 2 CBs and then just midfielders, we finished 6th. We also only dropped to sixth on the last day of the season. Imagine where we would be without Migs imploding for a few weeks, and a fit Sturridge.

Compared to where we were when BR took over, there have been massive steps in the right direction.

Until that game I was in a football drought for like 4 years, I just watched thr occasional CL game, the 3-4 game against Inter being among those. With 0-4 at halftime, I went to bed, but next day father told me about a certain Welsh guy scoring a hattrick. Got curious and watched the 3-1 match. Liked the play style, players(Bale, Modrič, Rafa, Roman...) and especially the kits(navy blue and white, how can a non-gooner not love this?). I was slowly getting back into football again, so i just went with Tottenham. 

Because that season was pretty late already and Spurs set for EL and had nothing to fight for, I didn't fall in love till the next season.  Still remember that Scotty Parker purchase, soo good. And thankfully the Arry business with Saha and Nelsen didn't turn me away.

I haven't been a fan for a long time, but I love how the club has progressed in recent years. It's been fun to be a part of this and I can only guess how older fans must feel, who have seen Tottenham in more average league placements. Visiting the Lane(3-2 vs Saints last season) has also been a dream come true(am from Slovenia, not that cheap to watch a game) and I hope I get to do it once more, before they move out.",null,0,null,1433109611,null,0,false,0,crr7q2b,null,t3_3801u5,null,t1_crr7q2b,null,t3_3801u5,null,null,null,1433504184,null,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0,null

It's really not. Sure, it's arguable - but the argument against reason is a ridiculous one.

&gt; The fact of the matter is that consciousness exists beyond the body and this can be proven on a personal level through practise.

That's not proof at all, that's altered consciousness. Taking a hit of LSD and having an out of body experience does not prove consciousness beyond the body, likewise neither does having an out of body experience through meditation. It is just an example of how reality is subjective to the conditions our body and brain are currently in.

&gt; Now you can take what you've read as fact but that is only another persons experience and opinion.

Not really, when we have experiments in labs that change peoples consciousness and implant false memories and all sorts of stuff - scientists actually know how to implant these ideas into people. It's scientific fact that it can be done and does happen, there's nothing subjective about it. It it's not personal experience and opinion - it's viewable, demonstrable, and fact. The brain can be manipulated.

&gt; closed your mind off from the possibility making any progress impossible and that is just bad science.

I'll believe it when I see it, when a miracle occurs, when something positive happens to any/all of the people suffering in the world. Something that backs up the idea of a benevolent higher being. Otherwise its merely clutching at straws and 'looking' for anything that can be misconstrued as evidence (like seeing Jesus in toast for example). I haven't closed my mind, it's just any and all evidence points toward there not being a benevolent higher power.

&gt; Meditation is a gateway and the only way that you will discover that is by trying it otherwise your opinion on the subject is worthless not just to me but to yourself. 

Yeah, I've meditated in the past - I used it when I was suffering from depression, my own subjective reality. It helped alter my state of mind. It does have a scientifically measurable effect on the mind. It is not, however, transcending space and/or time or viewing a higher being etc - it's just another altered state of mind - like being drunk or high or daydreaming or being asleep or tripping balls on hallucinogens etc etc, there are tons of altered states of mind. None are holy - it's simply action/reaction.

&gt; Keep an open mind.

Sounds like by going to uni you are going to be doing that already but there are two things I'd say to consider from the top of my head right now:

1) Learn to cook so you can eat healthy and cheap. Don't eat oven pizzas every night or get takeout and make packed lunches don't spend £5+ every day on bought lunch. 

2) Get as much real work experience as you can, ideally relevant to the industry you want to move into. If you get the chance to spend a year in industry in the middle of your degree then take it. Having real experience will put you way ahead of the pack when you leave. A lot of graduates leave uni thinking they know everything and people should be throwing jobs at them but the reality is that they know nothing about the real working world.

Are there gangs in prison? You mentioned them briefly. In the US they seem to be based on race. What are they based on in the UK?

What are mealtimes like? Do inmates eat together? Are there etiquette rules, like not reaching over someone else's plate?

How common is violence/sexual assault? 

Are prisons really full of drugs?

Is there a prison economy and trade in certain commodities e.g. Tobacco?

Are guards corrupt? How?

You mentioned that you stood up for yourself when you needed to. Would you mind explaining what happened?

Sorry about asking so many questions but most people seem to base their opinions of prison on movies and TV. It's fascinating to hear about the reality from someone who has really been there.

null,false,heyzuess,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,null,"&gt; The EU court is a great thing and beneficial to the people and I'm glad it's there

For the most part I agree, but sometimes the court's interpretation of the European Law overshadowing our own interpretation of our own British Law is dangerous. A nation should have pure overruling sovereignty. If we want to expel someone from the country for example, we should be able to do so without them appealing to a higher court that passes judgements based on laws with less legal precedence. We have centuries worth of precedence. Now, someone in the East of Sweeden, or the south of Portugal, or Greece is able to decide on local legal affairs in the UK. As it stands it's unhealthy. For instance what if the Bush/Gore election incident happened in the UK? It gets taken to court and lands in favour of party Y each time, but party X keeps on escalated and escalated until it ends up at the European legal system. The European system says that Party X has won, but the highest court in the UK says Party Y has won. Who wins the election?

What even is the point in having a british legal system at all in this case if the European system can overrule it? What's the point in having such a high-ruling legal system with very few smaller cases to base its precedence on?

&gt; could you use a worse example of a landlocked country in Europe, it needs a special dispensation unless it's creates a new trade route through the earth's core

My point is that the system still works in spite of Switzerland's trade agreements. Switzerland can buy a truck full of widgets from China and drive them all the way through the EU paying no fees or levy, into Switzerland and then sell them as part of the European Economic Community, competing with Widgets from Greece and Spain and Italy. The whole thing doesn't come crashing down around them. Switzerland's access to water is basically irrelevant, if they were an island nation they'd still be savagely neutral, and would still get the same access to the EEC as they do now.

If it's a core textbook you just need to suck it up and buy it - everyone else had to. Ink is something which is covered because you may NEED to print something to write notes because you need something visual.I don't think the DSA system is very good, it often lumps together disabilities in the same category without thinking of specific needs of students - such as your monitor issue.Also if your student loan isn't covering it, and I assume you are too disabled to get a job, you should look into DLA/PIP - which also increases your student loans.",null,0,null,1433111038,null,0,false,0,crr8h59,null,t3_37wbqy,null,t1_crr8h59,null,t1_crqxg66,null,null,null,1433504539,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

No there wasn't gang culture like you see in US portrayals. The gangs I referred to are really just groups of guys from the same locale. Lot's of guys know each other, mix in the same circles outside or may even have had problems with each other on the outside, jail intel is pretty decent and generally keep potential problem inmates apart. 

Yes jails are full of drugs, mostly heroin as it clears the system quicker than anything else, generally brought in by new guys up their asses, people on release, sometimes by visitors, usually women and passed mouth to mouth. Generally it's smoked and especially in Barlinnie everybody bought rolls of polos or frosties with foil linings to use later for burning. 

Barlinnie food was fairly poor, served at the bottom of each block then eaten in the cells. Breakfast after 8am, lunch after 12 then dinner at 5. Other than work, which wasn't universal, limited exercise an some association from 7 til 8 that be all the time out of the cell for the standard inmate. In Kilmarnock it was a lot looser, meals were at similar times, lot more choice and better prepared and meals taken communally at tables of 4. No real etiquette, just sitting chatting etc. 

There's some violence, mostly over drugs, the occasional bad blood, nowhere near as much as telly would have you believe. I never heard of any sexual assaults on inmates whilst there. Might have been but nothing I heard about at all. 

Yes there's a prison economy, in Barlinnie it was mostly around phonecards and tobacco, In Kilmarnock it was similar but because prisoners earned more and there was much greater range of stuff to buy at canteen, anything bought there was currency.

There was always rumours of some officers being corrupted and the former Librarian at Barlinnie was supposed to have been jailed for smuggling in drugs after being blackmailed buy a prisoners outside connections. Ended up in Greenock if I recall. Never experienced it directly myself. 

Because I wasn't a known person to anyone in there there were some who attempted to take liberties, asking favours that could have got me into crap or just trying to take the piss to see how I would react. I'm not particularly big but I did know how to handle myself and it was a matter of showing that I'd be prepared to go ahead if pushed too far.

I am pro-EU and would be very disappointed if my country, whom for all it's faults I still do love, chose to leave the Union. I think I would feel very torn in terms of loyalty and suddenly much more distant from my homeland (and family) even though it'd still be only a 2-hour train ride away.

I also wonder what would become of me as an EU migrant (people seem to forget that British citizens living working abroad in the EU are migrants just as much as the Poles and Romanians that come to the UK...). I like to think that I would continue to enjoy the same rights here as before - within France at least, but I would not want to have to rely on having a work permit that's only valid here, so in order to continue to enjoy all the rights of a full EU citizen I suppose I would apply to become French, assuming the rules don't change on allowing double nationality. My SO is from another EU country and we've previously lived elsewhere in the EU; and as I said I don't feel French and don't necessarily want to stay here forever.

2) Do you really need a car yet? It's a huge expenditure, between driving lessons if you need them, insurance, the car itself and running costs. If you're staying near the university or there is a bus service, it can be better to abstain from a car unless you really *need* one for some reason. Insurance will cost more while you're young. 

3) If you're lucky enough that your parents are supporting you and you don't have to pay rent/bills, working will let you save up money quickly, even on minimum wage.

To be honest, apart from Slovenia and Croatia you'll find it a piece of piss unless you've never been abroad before - it's all within the EU, almost all (except HR) within the Schengen area, and you'll only need to show a passport twice after Calais. Just check the rules about wild camping - it's prohibited in more places than you'd realise, and time spent dealing with Police can really eat into your fun time. Trust me.

If you can spare the time (and if we could do Istanbul and back in 16 days, you can do plenty in four weeks) it's worth heading out of the EU to where things really start to get interesting. Within the EU, Romania and Bulgaria are ripe for adventure, though even Hungary is an eye-opener if you've not been out that way before, especially away from Budapest. If you're going to Croatia, head south and dip into Bosnia - it has oodles of scenery, surprisingly good roads, and a lot of recent history. Mostar in particular is worth a visit.

If you can't, then be sure to do the B500 south off Baden-Baden, which will take you all the way through the Black Forest to the Swiss border. Buy Michelin maps, which have lively roads edged with green, making it easy to plot an interesting route away from the motorways. Do more than one pass in the Alps - the Stelvio is well known but the Timmelsjoch/Passorombo is at least as good, and there are loads more in Switzerland.

Take photos. Shitloads of them. If nothing else, it'll jog your memory. Stop a lot. See stuff. Don't just spend all day trundling along. The most important thing, and I can't stress this enough, is to be open minded and friendly. Assume everyone you meet is a decent sort, and never turn down the chance for a hospitality or a chat. It's what turns a simple road trip into a memorable experience, and it's too easy to have your defences up and miss all the good stuff.

Bartholomew actually picked the right issue that we should talk about, but makes the wrong arguments about it. 

The current definition of poverty has some wacky effects to certain scenarios. For example, if food prices or rent dropped, that somehow doesn't reduce poverty, but if a lot of very rich people went bankrupt and lost everything, that somehow improves poverty. When the measure actually follows what is likely to increase or decrease poverty, it's often incidental and not proportional.

What left wingers should really do is point out that our measure of poverty is far far too obsessed with money and income and ignores the human element of poverty. People don't live by the number on their paycheck, they have different obligations and circumstances, and if they have to sacrifice something which is fundamental to humane living to meet a different obligation, that's poverty.
