And in England's vision English MPs have their vote in the UK while Scottish MPs can only have their vote when they agree with the English MPs.

Really the only fair option for everyone is independence;  I think if more English people had spoken up about these inequalities we might not have voted no, lured by English MPs promising more power for us without handing more powers over to Westminster.


&gt;Yet when England says that it's not right Scotland can be the decider in what happens in England, Scotland disagrees.

There is a fundamental difference between a veto and a proportional vote, as I've said we'd be happy with the same veto powers, would you be happy if Scotland could veto any English legislation; Would you trust us with that power?  And if not, why should we trust you?

Even in proportional representation we are out done most of the time;

Giving Sterling a break was planned before the start of the season. That doesn't happen often but it should. That's why so many youngsters can get burnt so quickly. It was for his long term good not short term. It's not that he just felt tired and we had to give him break. He would've probably said that he doesn't feel tired and can play but players like him (and Sturridge) need different care. That's a not something you can put against the club or Rodgers.

You can't underestimate lower league teams away. Chelsea underestimated Bradford and they got burnt for it.

* Income 38.400 p.a I use in tax allowance first 20.000 not taxed, 9.600 savings in ISA so currently I pay tax for 8.800 (38.400 income-20.000 nontaxable income- 9600 ISA savings). So my tax bill is 1920 instead of 3680 if I didn't save.  

* I was wondering if I can bring an additional £8800 in my ISA account from abroad. This way I would save and additional 1920 and I would make use of all my allowances in this income bracket. Next year if my income will change, let's say 44000 then i would save 9600 and bring the difference to 24.000 from abroad, and so on. 1920 this year with 2000-3000 next year will add up to something in the end.

null,false,seemylolface,lfc12,,null,"We played Lucas a few times as a defensive midfielder in the 4-2-3-1 and it didn't work.  He looked so bad people were calling for him to be dropped entirely and not play again, calling to Allen to play instead of him even.  He often had Gerrard next to him when we did this, so I'm sure that's part of it of course, but we've say Lucas and Gerrard together in the 3-4-3 at times too and it wasn't nearly as catastrophic as it was in the 4-2-3-1.

The system is what let us get points without Sturridge.  It caters to the strengths of our very pacey creative players like Markovic, Sterling, and Moreno while maximizing Coutinho's ability to influence the game by giving him an abundance of players moving around him to play with.  It keeps us solid at the back because we have 2 players shielding the back line as well as a very strong center of the pitch.  Look back at our performances this season in the 4 back system, we got ripped apart through the middle and couldn't stay compact enough in defense, leading to space, mistakes, and stupid goals conceded.  Rodgers has eliminated those two big problems with a system change and we haven't suffered what so ever in the attack from that change, in fact we look better going forward.

You're trying to count their goals in this formation but they've only been playing in it for like 2-2.5 months now.  I'd also argue that no matter what system you put Coutinho in he's going to struggle for goals until he learns to calm his nearves and stay composed while shooting, which has nothing to do with 4-3-3 or 3-4-3.  Give them the rest of the season and see where they end up.

I don't know if you're suggesting that the Scottish Parliament decided that English students should pay but European's shouldn't? Either way that is incorrect. The Scottish Government *has* to fund EU student's courses because they cannot discriminate against students from other European countries while in the EU. However, governments or local governments are free to discriminate in that way within their own wider country, which is why rUK students have to pay fees. It would be nice if the Scottish Government could pay for English students too but that would simply crush the entire system, it was a big feature of the independence debate with lots of people worrying that this would happen once the rUK became technically another EU country, although others said a special exception would have been made by the EU, but lets not get back into that.

Selling Bony in the Winter while he's performing well likely inflated his cost and it was wise to sell high. Winter transfers are generally more expensive because most teams want to keep their best players to either avoid relegation or move higher up in their table. Swansea are in a position where relegation is not a huge worry (knock on wood) and moving into the top 5 is not likely either. It would be more beneficial to take an inflated sum of money to reinvest in the summer, than to maybe move up a few places and lose out on cash if his form (and therefore value) were to dip in the second half. Also, the fact that he is playing in the African Cup of Nations means that we would have been without out him for quite a few games anyways.

As for your idea of prospects, instead of straight up trading prospects, they basically can use the money to buy ""prospects from any other team in the world. Trading player for player confines you to only the prospects from one team, but a transfer fee gives you the freedom to scout out young players at any team and out in a bid for them. And even then, trading for prospects is risky (just like in baseball) because they could always turn out to be a bust and at the cost of a good player. With the money you get from a transfer, you can by players of any age and any skill level to fill in any gaps you might have. For example, we ""needed"" a CDM. So instead getting a prospect from Man City that would take time to develop or getting a good quality CDM, but little to no cash in return, we could use the money from the transfer to buy a CDM that fits our needs from another team. Jack Cork is quality enough to start for our team straight away, but is old enough that we won't have to overpay because he has likely grown to nearly his peak potential. Pricing of players and finding the right fit for a certain team can get kind of complicated.

I hope that all makes sense and helped a little bit.

Every club wants to win trophies. Every team wants to be in the Champions League. 

That said, and this seems particularly true of modern football, it can't be the end-all-be-all destination for most clubs. If it was, fans of clubs who win lots of trophies wouldn't give a shit  about those of clubs who don't...we all know from experience that this isn't the way it is. Attacking and attractive football can make you feel good and entertain you, having a team of fully committed players--some of who represent their local community--can make you proud.

And if you are the type to ignore the sentimental and passionate side of supporting a football club, you surely can't ignore the financial side. Five teams in the Premier League make and spend a lot more money than us. I would rather build something slowly to have the best of both worlds when we're capable of being more competitive financially. 

If we qualified this season we wouldn't remotely be able to invest what's necessary to actually keep us there, and then the toxicity would probably return. I think our fans are starting to remember when we were more worried about the journey than the destination and hopefully that can continue. The ""Champions League or bust"" mentality is unrealistic and stupid, and it only hurts us.

- How is protesting in front of Downing Street showing restraint?

- Which 'two sides' is he on about? The journalists and Muslims? Journalists and terrorists? By suggesting his movement is part of a 'side' it immediately destroys unity. By extension he is aligning his 'side' with the terrorists as they are both taking offence at the exact same thing. 

- How dare he compare the terrorists with the cartoonists. 'Perpetual mistakes by extremists, either by cold-blooded killers or uncivilised expressionists'. People drawing cartoons are not extremists. 

- There is no room for 'responsible debate' when religion of any kind is involved. Religion, by its very nature, does not want debate because debate makes people think and making people think creates unbelievers. They want to stop people drawing fucking cartoons. How is there any room for responsible debate? Nobody is forcing you to buy the newspaper and look at the image of your Prophet.

null,false,AcaiPalm,lfc68,,null,"&gt;*Rodgers main formation over his career has always been a 433/4231 kinda mix up actually.. and it suits our players.*

The 'main formation' which he has used during his short managerial  career has always whichever formation he thinks best utilities the players he has at his disposal. To suggest he has one or two go to formations is a bit of a slight on someone who has shown himself to be a very resourceful and dynamic manager.  I do recall him saying that the 4-3-3 is in his mind the most balanced formation but since being at Liverpool he's never been able to pull it off convincingly. 

&gt;*This season it didn't work as we didn't have Lucas playing defensive midfielder, instead we had Gerrard who was on a pretty bad run of form around October/November.*

Lucas played as a defensive mid in the first five games of the season, but in these early games he was playing alongside Gerrard. This didn't work because we had two defensive midfielders who didn't have enough mobility or stamina to play this position convincingly, they couldn't cover runners from midfield or assist the fullbacks without leaving the middle of the park open. 

&gt;*Coutinho and Sterling were also out of form around that time.*

They were out of form because they were play makers who had nobody to play the ball through to, early in this season we had an option of either Lamber or Ballotelli up front by themselves. This meant they had no movement in front of them and since these two strikers don't run off the shoulder of the opposition defense, they could easily play a high line and restrict the space they had to play in.

&gt;*This formation has solved the defense but the attack is still pretty average.. not enough goals from midfield still.*

When you're playing three at the back with two holding midfielders you don't expect them to need to chip in with goals, its great if they do but the onus is on the wingbacks and front three to score goals. You have to remember we've been playing a 20 year old winger as a striker in this formation because he's the only player we had available which could run in behind defenses and give our play makers room to play. Now that we have our 20 goals a season striker back fully fit it's going to be much easier to score.

The campus is amazing. It is grand and beautiful. The university is big and has many amenities and things to do. It feels like a university town on campus but all while being in a big vibrant city. It is close to the city centre of Birmingham, just two train stops to the central station, and then close to all you could need. The high streets near campus have shops and pubs and you'll be sorted there too.

Birmingham is vibrant with lots of nightlife, be it pubs clubs or music venues. Everyone plays in Birmingham, be it central for big pop rock acts or some smaller venues for alternative ones.

Birmingham is also very centrally located within Britain. It is in the Midlands of course. It is easy to go travelling within Britain. Its an hour an a half to London by train, and the same goes for Manchester and Liverpool and Cardiff. You can see a lot more. And the tickets aren't expensive from there. In York, being far out you'll take longer for travelling and you'll spend more too. I used to go on gigs in London and take the last train home to Birmingham some times. Couldn't do that from York.

I am sure people will be great in York too, but I've met amazing people in Birmingham. I was welcomed with open arms and made many friends.

I'm sure I saw Sterling also say that it was already planned since summer.

He was complaining about him being tired because he wanted to pressurise Hodgson to not play Sterling in national team games. Sterling was off form and we already lost Sturridge to Hodgson's ancient training techniques. We took care of our players in training, England didn't. 

Rossiter was already planned to play in Youth FA cup. Also, he isn't quite ready to play senior games. His first games have to be carefully planned. In the later stages cups start to mean a lot more to the club, there are expectations. Borini is not a good player, how many times do we have to go through this?

One other problem that I don't think has been mentioned is that if Scottish MPs are explicitly banned from voting on certain issues and hence there are times when there is no point them being in parliament, some might ask why they should then still be paid the same amount for their job as MPs from the rest of Britain. If Scottish MPs get a pay cut to reflect their reduced responsibilities then candidates would have much less incentive to stand in Scotland, given that they could be paid more if they stood elsewhere. The result being that the quality of Scotland's MPs declines. 

The only way out of this mess is to properly devolve power across the country so that only British affairs come before parliament, affairs that all MPs vote for. I don't think it matters whether the country is a federation or a unitary state. But if that doesn't happen then the only other way it's going to end is with the country splitting apart.

You can take a bus to Balerno and find 30 miles of trails in the Pentlands. I was there over the weekend. It's currently ideal for running as the ice and snow keeps the ground hard, otherwise it would be very muddy. [This track](http://i.imgur.com/DYoMSgL.jpg) near Bavelaw farm goes on for miles. Alternatively you can start at the Hillend side, but you'll have a 300metre initial climb to do first!

You can also take the Canal route. After the city bypass it's pretty much fields and forests all the way

You can start at the Water of Leith Conservation Trust on Lanark Road, and heading south you can follow an unbroken trail all the way to Balerno. You can go the other way too to Leith but you will have to cut across a lot of roads

Corstorphine Hill is nice, but it's a bit small. Alternatively you can go to Brae Hill (watch out for massive lumps of horseshit), and then to Blackford. It's a great run. I do it regularly.

For a short run you can go to Arthur's Seat. It's 3 miles around on the road, but there are trails all over too. 

We're all really lucky to live in Edinburgh as it has some of the best running trails compared to most cities.

Taking offence doesn't make someone a terrorist. You can be on the same arbitrary 'side' of an issue and not condone a person's actions.

If we play 343 next season then we need to buy a striker who can score 20+ a season, and we aren't going to be able to do that unless we spend a ridiculous amount of money which most likely isn't going to happen. We could also buy a high goalscoring midfielder but that's not going to happen either.. Henderson is going to be our captain and Sterling and Coutinho's places in the teams are cemented.

So what are we going to do? just hope Sturridge stays fit for 80%+ of the season? and that's exactly why I think we're going to switch back to a 433/4231 next season. Bring in a decent left/right winger who can score a few goals then we can play Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson and Sturridge with the new signing all at the same time.",null,0,null,1423426404,null,0,false,0,cof8ntf,null,t3_2v4i6w,null,t1_cof8ntf,null,t1_cof7n67,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

There's  a Go Ape where you can do zip wiring and other stuff. The weather shouldn't be too much of an issue either, as long as you're hardy folk, cause the trees should give some rain cover. But you'll obviously need outdoors clothing and good shoes.

The other place you could visit is Beatrix potters house, Hill Top. I'm not sure if she's as famous in the US but she wrote Peter Rabbit and other children's books. It's a lovely little cottage anyway. But this is a bit further out of Keswick.

The UK government have at least been pushing for sanctions during the crisis, and notably they were/are allegedly pushing for a SWIFT ban, which many on the mainland feel would be too extreme. I doubt you could find an actual public speech by Cameron calling for SWIFT bans though, because that kind of discussion is kept behind closed doors. 

I think there's a feeling that a European crisis should be seen to be solved by Europeans, and the UK has always considered itself to be apart from the rest of Europe. Russia is no direct threat to us, but it is a more pressing concern to Poland and other countries in eastern Europe. Germany is naturally expected to take the lead in discussions, being the powerhouse of Europe, even though it clearly doesn't like to. No other country really has the mandate to say ""we will lift EU sanctions if you do x, y and z"" other than Germany. 

It's also worth noting that nobody currently listens to the UK anyway, we have similar views to the US on issues like this but we have a lot less influence than them.

  Firstly, whilst obedience is a key feature of islam, it is not gender-specific. Men as well as women have their responsibilities and duties towards their parents, spouses (which IS a two-way thing), those in their community and towards God Himself. However it is the case that for the two sexes, they have **different** responsibilities and roles in the world. This does not negate the position of a woman in any way, who in the sight of Allah will be rewarded just as man is.

&gt;sexually chaste

Again, this is not limited to women. The Qur'an does not make any gender-specific exceptions to the commands for sexual purity. 

&gt;servants to their husbands

There is nothing in the Qur'an or hadith which even remotely backs this up, and even the most basic reading of the biographies of Aisha (ra) and the other Umm Al-Mumiin (ra) reveal that far from being silent, invisible ghosts, they were independent, out-spoken, very involved members of the early Muslim community- the wives often accompanied Muhammad (saw) on trips, and functioned as religious instructors and scholars for men as well as women. Similarly 200 or so hadith were narrated by A'isha (ra), who also served as a general in battle. 

  You might also want to remember, Muhammad's (saw) first wife, Khadijah (ra) was, at a time and in a society which placed little value on women, the owner of a great deal of wealth and the manager of a successful trading business, and at no time was she ever prevented from doing as she saw fit to do.

He stopped the women saying, “It is not proper for you to walk in the middle of the path, you had better walk along the walls.”

In Abu Dawud, p.284, Hadith No. 4931, it is narrated upon the authority of Aisha  that she said: ""I used to play with my friends and whenever the Prophet entered they would leave and whenever he went out they would come back in.""

In Abu Dawud Hadith No.4933, it is narrated that Aisha said: ""The Prophet married me at seven and we had relationship at nine (THAT'S 9!!!! He screwed a nine year old! That's all kinds of messed up) and when I moved to medina some women prepared me for the wedding and they nor I ever mixed with men in a house of women. The women received me and men received the Prophet and then we went to the house.""

Quran 4:34

Edit:  [Slightly more easy to read translation from Sahih international](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&amp;verse=34) - 

&gt;Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Edit II.  There's also this gem:

&gt;Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, ""O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)."" They asked, ""Why is it so, O Allah's Apostle ?"" He replied, ""You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you."" The women asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?"" They replied in the affirmative. He said, ""This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?"" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, ""This is the deficiency in her religion.""

Yes it's still a cup win but it's nowhere near as big as qualifying for the CL. Both money wise and prestige wise... we're not going to be able to keep Sterling/Coutinho/Can etc if we don't get in the CL, it's that simple.

Lallana moved to us because he wanted CL, he himself said that quite a few times...

I didn't say that's the only reason we'd be able to attract them, but world class players wont consider us at all if we're not in the CL.. we're not United who can offer silly money to players like Di Maria and Falcao as like you said.. FFP which will only get worse if we're not in the CL. Even players who aren't world class are less likely to move to us if we're not in the CL sadly.. 

That Sterling video is ridiculous, just shows how much he has fucked up since there was a massive storm about Sterling being tired in October. If Sterling isn't completely fucked up within 2 years it'll be a miracle, he has played far too much football already. Even with his break he has played the 2nd most amount of football this season at 1968 which is 2 minutes behind Henderson..

Don't try and pretend like we didn't have a big part in Sterling being tired.. he played 90 minutes vs Ludo on 16th September, 90 vs West Ham on 20th, 120 vs Middlesborough on 23rd,  90 vs Everton on 27th, 90 vs Basel on 1st October and then 90 again vs West Brom on the 4th. That's insane, he didn't get substituted off once.  Then a week after that was when he said he was tired... and no shit.

Rossiter played vs Middlesborough in the Capital One Cup and looked pretty good, and Middlesborough are a lot better than Bolton..

And it's funny you say that about Borini since he scored in the last game he started. I don't care if he's not good enough for Liverpool, he's good enough to score vs a team like Bolton.

Do you think ""Westminster politicians"" voted to create the Scottish Parliament out of the goodness of their hearts or because the Scottish people demanded it? The only way an English Parliament will happen is if English people demand it. 

The only lasting constitutional settlement within the UK is federalism. If federalism doesn't happen then Scottish independence will sooner or later.

So with that in mind, I'm really really hesitant about BR playing Lovren. When you play with wingbacks, especially not a dedicated wingback, every one of the 3 CB's needs to be sharp positionally and mentally for as long as possible. We saw yesterday, with Can and Sakho making a few irrational decisions, that Squirtle needed to be massively solid to make up for it. Lovren just hasn't shown he's capable of doing that yet. 

So I'd have a back 4 of Manquillo, Skrtel, Sakho and Moreno (we saw in the match at WHL Spurs are vulnerable down the flanks i.e. first and third goals). Put Can in Lucas' place, next to Henderson. If Lallana's fit to start, play him with Coutinho ahead at the tip, with Sterling roaming behind Sturridge. If not, have Sterling and Coutinho behind Sturridge and Balotelli.

&gt;It added: “The vast majority of Muslims worldwide shall not denigrate their historical and current values by reciprocating hatred

&gt;“Muslims shall call upon their deep spiritual strength and take the moral high ground by inviting the world to civility in any form of expression, dialogue, discourse and debate.”

&gt;The Forum delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street signed by over 100,000 British Muslims to highlight the view that the majority of Muslims worldwide call for 'Global Civility' rather than destruction of human life.

&gt;The group also expressed ""deep regret"" at the Paris terror attacks, which included a massacre at Charlie Hebdo, saying they were a ""violation of Islamic law"".

&gt;Shaykh Tauqir Ishaq, a senior spokesman for the Forum, said ""Perpetual mistakes by extremists, either by cold-blooded killers or uncivilised expressionists, cannot be the way forward for a civilised society.

&gt;Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).

&gt;—Sahih al-Bukhari, 7:62:64

Also - I'd love to talk to Muslim women about their opinions, but I can't help but notice that all the women I see on the bus wearing the hijab act like they'd rather die than start up a conversation with a Western man.  (Not that I ever intrude on them.)

I can think of only one account that doesn't charge but the name escapes me atm, but I find it safer to use a credit card while abroad. 

Halifax's Clarity credit card is awesome for using abroad, on purchases and taking cash out in local currency. Don't get charged a fee for currency exchanges. 

On my last holiday I spent around £1900, and I paid the balance off within 6 weeks, and paid I think about £12 in interest. I would have spent far more than £12 in fee's alone

Here's one last example, I was in Turkey last may and at the ATM, cashed out 300 Turkish lira. When I checked my statement, it was about £80. If I exchanged £100, I would have received 300 Turkish lira. So was better off in that respect as well.

Everyone who seems to level that criticism at you cannot come up with an adequate definition of what that turn of phrase actually means, only what it does not. Before football was a professionalized results-oriented industry, clubs held far more meaning for supporters, and were defined beyond their successes. They were avatars of local identities, mediators of a given community fixed in place, a type of bond that predates the game's transformation into the globalized machine that it is today.

Success without meaning, in my opinion, is no success at all. I think Top 4 is an important goal to strive for in a forward-minded way, but not the decisive factor in determining what this season actually signifies for us as a club. We have seen a manager transform an unruly pack of prima donnas into a team in every sense of the word: a collective mentality, a hunger for glory, and a fighting spirit, all the while playing in a beautifully entertaining style. Instead of purchasing talent, he's instilled the value of producing it from the ground up, and has laid a framework for development and used the talent we've cultivated ourselves, a model that has paid dividends elsewhere and ensures us stability in our reach for the top, it's a kind of model for success that predates the hegemony of purchasing power, and proves the old way can't entirely be forgotten.

So while I do think that Top 4 is a good goal to have, it is by no means an ultimatum or measure of how successful a season is. If we retain belief in our squad, our drive, and the general project of what we're doing and find happiness and real meaning in it, are we not successful? Trophies stand to mark that success, but are not the successes in and of themselves. I'd rather fall aiming high on a foundation built out of a collective heritage and shared belief that we can do it than cynically buy our way to the mountaintop.

The players come here because they want to come to Liverpool. I don't think CL was a major deciding factor for Lallana, this is just a great point to bring out on interviews. Liverpool is still miles bigger and more attractive club than Southampton and similar clubs. We don't have to be in CL or do even that well to get good players. The club attracts players. The problem is that higher quality players have more clubs after them. We got players like Suarez, Coutinho, Sturridge without big competition. 

CL money is a factor but not that big one. We can easily cope without it as we've done great work getting new sponsorship deals. 

About Sterling:

&gt; That Sterling video is ridiculous, just shows how much he has fucked up since there was a massive storm about Sterling being tired in October. If Sterling isn't completely fucked up within 2 years it'll be a miracle, he has played far too much football already.

Playing minutes doesn't equal higher risk of getting muscle injuries/getting fatigued if the player is looked after in training. It's already public that we use different regimes on our ""faster"" players, players whose muscles need more time to recover or they different recovery methods. It's quite clear that to this day, some set ups don't use it. Hodgson doesn't believe in it (different recovery to those players) apparently. The ""tired Sterling"" mess was also fueled by that, not so much of the minutes he plays. In this case Sturridge is an exception, his problems are hereditary and he's been very unlucky lately. I believe he even said it himself in some interview.

This is not 90s or early 00s, the sports science has come a long way. The chance of Sterling doing an ""Owen"" and completely breaking down is very low nowadays.

About the Rossiter case:

Middlesborough was the first round (for us) match at Anfield. Bolton was much more critical. There was several reasons why it was critical: many big teams have fallen out already; it was later round of the cup; we had already invested a 90 minutes and didn't get a win - if we had lost the replay, we basically played the replay, tired and risked our players for pretty much nothing. You gotta admit, that would've sucked hard... It was too important at that point to go through to play Rossiter. He's not that ready yet, he's 17, inexperienced + the youth FA cup. He's very good and definitely has bright future, but I'd give him more time. He's already left his mark in the Liverpool history. Maybe he could go on loan for his next step.

About Borini:

He did score but I don't remember him playing very well. It's pretty much all he did that game - scored. His hold-up play, first touch, ball control is very bad for a professional striker. Rodgers hasn't even used him as a striker lately when he was needed - he was at wingback against Bolton. He works hard, I'll give him that, but there is a line how far he can go with technique base like that. And being striker for this Liverpool team is beyond that line. We're just so much better off with Sterling as a striker, and that's saying something.

End notes:

The argument is starting to run rounds and it doesn't seem to get anywhere, so I'd say let's finish our thoughts and leave it at that. 

The CL/trophy stuff is just an opinion and we shouldn't just argue whose opinion is better if we're just couple of fans (assuming you, like me, aren't some kind of footballing person doing football stuff somewhere higher up).

I just feel you're doing Rodgers unjustice over the ""tired Sterling"" case. Raheem looks very fit athlete and doesn't pick up injuries easily. I remember him getting injured in Rodgers' first season when he had longer time out of the team, other than that he has been in great condition. As I see it, his only possible trouble seems getting fatigued and running his muscles to the ground. But I trust that we have paid professionals who specifically look after him and other players individually and give their advice how to change their training methods if needed. It says something about England's coaching staff if they don't - they should, it's ~~2014~~2015!",null,0,null,1423434397,null,0,false,0,cofd31n,null,t3_2v6lzb,null,t1_cofd31n,null,t1_cofa2hb,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

-------------------------------------------------------------

In most countries with a large Muslim population, Islam is the dominant, controlling religion. This is a position it enjoys and takes for granted in many parts of the world. As Islam comes into closer contact with the West, it still maintains this attitude of dominance and Islamic hegemony. Islam isn't demanding respect as much as it's trying to assert itself over other cultures.


When Muslims encounter a society where they have no special status, they notice this lack of Islamic hegemony. Back home, when certain Islamic rules are broken by anyone, Muslim or not, those people are punished for blasphemy. It's a given. But in the West, religious Muslims don't have any particular power. This lack of power can be seen as a lack of respect. When they demand respect, they are actually trying to assert themselves and their beliefs on others. That's because they see Islam as rightly deserving of such a position, compared to other religions and ideologies.


For example, drawing Muhammad or anyone else isn't inherently disrespectful. However, it is against the laws in Islam to depict their prophet. When Muslims ask you to respect their faith and not draw Muhammad, they are not really asking for respect. When Muslims ask you not to interrupt them during prayers or tempt them during Ramadan, then they are asking for respect. When Muslims ask you not to draw Muhammad, they actually asking you to follow a tenet of Islam. They are asserting their religious beliefs on you. They are trying to oppress you in a sense, whether or not they understand it.


When they protest against a non-Muslim who has drawn Mohammed's picture, it is not a legitimate protest. If a non-Muslim forces a Muslim to draw a picture of Muhammad, that would be a cause for a legitimate protest. However, when they protest against drawings made by non-Muslims, it is akin to a mob protesting blasphemers and heretics. 


In the West we believe in free speech and religious freedom, but Muslims in the East see this as an affront to what's good and holy and society itself. Our doctrine of free speech is a blasphemy. But these protests are as barbaric as protesting against Christians having a church because a trinitarian conception of God contradicts Islam. We should see it as such.

Drivers tell you what speed is safest based on the 85%ile speed of the road. This is gathered by a lot of data analysis such as tube counters, or radars mounted on lighting columns. 

All local authorities have to undertake a speed limit review. However, professional advice is ignored constantly by elected members. 

A wide laned road with minimal accesses will cause safe drivers to increase their speeds as they are sensible and deem it safe to do so. Reducing a limit to 20mph where the 85%ile speed over the course of the road is say 30mph is frankly wrong. 20's plenties had no significant effect on vehicle speeds, so why do you think this will be different?

The costs involved for this will be ridiculous as 20's require repeater signage whereby 30's do not if the area is streetlit. It's a political move with minimal to no benefit which will cost the taxpayer a lot of money for installation and maintenance. 

This will criminalise a lot of motorists. Although saying that, I doubt the police will actually enforce it. What use is a limit of it's not enforced? Having spoken with the police about these issues, I have been informed that in most areas, they have not been in agreement with the proposals.

If you call someone a derogatory name, such as kraut or poof, you're obviously going to be shot down.

If you insist on our personal opinion, then here is mine:
How long is it on the market for? If it is on for more than 3 months, then how does it suddenly have 3 bidders? Could it be a trap to lure you into making a better offer? Although generally the market picks up after the x-mas holidays, but I happen to know that the market was particularly active during this holiday period.

Anyway, I would bid like this:
((value after repairs) - (repair cost)) * 1.1

Why 10% higher? Because this is the one you want, and the market may recover soon. Also, it costs money to wait until you find the next ideal flat (you're now paying rent and you may not find any good deal next time etc).

It also matter in what sort of area is it? You say it's a good school area, then it is probably Bruntsfield or Marchmond, these areas are solid investments, you will not lose your money even if you bid 10% higher. But you must also consider: do you have kids? If not, then why are you paying the premium now? You could buy somewhere else for now and when you have kids and is time to get them to school move to a good school area.

If you have time, you can have a look at the other properties around this street, not only the similar ones. What are the market dynamics? What was the price per square feet in late 2014?

Not for the sake of getting one up on Chelsea or Arsenal, but purely because at the start of the season I want Tottenham to do as well as they possibly can. I want them to win all thirty-eight games, go to Wembley twice a year and bring home as many big-eared trophies as possible. Does that mean I'm disappointed with seventh, going out in the 3rd round, quarter final and group stages? No. Not because I don't care about results, but simply because I love this club and I will love it whether we're fighting for the title or fighting relegation.

There is one other reason I would love to end up fourth or higher and go to the Champions League. Pundits say it's big money and it helps bring in big names, but they've lost the point of going into Europe. It's big games.
This is why I relish the post-christmas Europa League, when the losers from the Champions League end up in the draw and we get to play clubs like Fiorentina. That's what I loved about the 2010-11 season. Playing Inter, Milan and Madrid. We didn't always play our best football and frankly against Real we got demolished, but seeing the same guys who go toe-to-toe with Stoke City go up against the biggest clubs in the world, that's glorious.

I don't want to sell our souls for it. In the end it makes me laugh we give Lamela and Soldado so much hardship for the money they cost us when Man Utd, City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have all paid that money several times over. I like that we're not bankrolled by oil or Americans. That we're still playing at the Lane. That ordinary guys like Bentaleb, Mason and Kane are setting the world alight.

And (forgive me), but that's what Bill Nicholson's quote is all about.

&gt;Anyone who makes such a claim such as your example will have to be prepared to then logically justify it. They cannot just state something as infallible fact,

Music to my ears, but you must know that there's no logical justification for religious belief.  It can't be defended through reason alone.

A lot of what he's saying is quite positive, even about the Prince's Trust being useful in providing young people with alternatives.

What I'm concerned about is how front stage he seems to want to be. He's testing the waters for his kingship and based on how this go down he'll probably conclude that the country wants a king telling us what to do. (After all anything even vaguely royal is treated by the BBC as the second coming).

He's also overtly religious in a nation where usually leaders avoid claiming to be divinely inspired (it pretty much never happened until Blair adopted religion apparently as a career move).

This phenomenon is pretty real and much scarier than a lot of people think. You know what it reminds me of?

The 'birther' brigade in the US who kept on pushing the agenda that Obama was not born in the US and is therefore not legitimate as the President. They would basically peddle this notion constantly, and when finally faced with the genuine presentation of what they asked, they would either ignore or pontificate on their demands, thereby demonstrating that the desire to oust him was more important than a genuine concern about the factuality of his birth in Hawaii, and thus keep on peddling once more.

The tell-tale sign shown by the ""Silent Moderates crowd"" that is similar to this kind of hidden agenda is the repetitive, formulaic nature of the accusation. It is *nearly always, incredibly, commonly* some variant of:

""If this isn't Islamic behaviour/condoned by Islamic value, *Why aren't/where are* all the moderates speaking out against it?""

It is, in essence, a *meme.* And a very callous, divisive, discriminatory one at that. Almost as if it were subconsciously intended to propagate on the strength of emotional appeal or blameworthy elegance.

If you hear anyone utter a sentence like so, *approach with extreme prejudice and scepticism* and *maintain reference* to evidence/recording of majority Muslim attitudes (conflicting evidence).

There are many, many hostile agents utilising this kind of claim. And the biggest culprit of them all? 

**Reddit.**

null,false,Jelly_Jim,null,null,null,"I find Curtis enjoyable as a storyteller, but that's the extent of my treatment of him. He creates some interesting and - suspending reality for a moment - somewhat plausible narratives (particularly if you buy into the worldview as presented by his colleagues).

For me, he takes the complex and complicated, explains them as such, and then reveals that he has 'connected the dots', as conspiracy theorists do. Unlike typical conspiracy theorists, however, he ambiguously alludes to the flaws of the characters he's constructed (they're never presented in their full context), stopping short of criticising (although it seems to be a common trait that he'll depict them as naive actors - with a hint of sympathy for them). It's as if he leaves it to his viewers to knowingly 'fill in the blanks', perhaps so they can cleverly own the conclusions that they've been guided to (and really, isn't everyone - even CiFers - entitled to believe they've developed an original thought in their lifetime?).

From what I watched of it, Bitter Lake felt like it was thinner than usual on narrative for me, mostly being old footage mashed up with a bit of narration, as various commentaries on it have said. It also raked over old ground. It's about eight years late, rehashing the 'Murica undertones which underpin countless other feature-length documentaries. That's not a position statement on geopolitics - just that his previous work is a bit more leftfield/topical, covering things which viewers are less likely to be familiar with.

You might appreciate Norm Geras' various commentary on Curtis: http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2007/03/the_history_of_.html

&gt; Indeed, if the film doesn't work as an investigate documentary that uncovers anything new, and if it doesn't work as an informative piece to the layman, what does it work as? The answer is as the adult equivalent of an art school project, injected with just enough pretension and 'avant-garde' use of archive footage to suggest relationships that might or might not exist to get an A, or a First, or whatever it is.

Also, there are procedures for when a party leader loses his seat in a GE, and if anyone believes for one second that the Lib Dems arent prepared for this eventuality, they are deluding themselves.  

There is already a line of possible succession - either Tim Farron, who is currently in a now insecure Scottish seat (Westmorland and Lonsdale), or Ed Davey, who is in a Lib Dem Safe Seat in London (Kingston and Surbiton). 

Either way, after the night, if Nick is pushed out, the machine will swing into motion and a new leader will be in his place within 24 hours.

On a side note, this election looks like sheer chaos. For the first time in a very long while, Sinn Fein may actually have a reason to scrap abstensionism and actually take their wesminster seats, as it looks like they will get to be a coalition partner in the next Irish Government (Dail) in 2016. They will see that as an absolute  mandate to insist on a referendum on Northern Ireland, which it looks like the unionists will lose currently. With them in the republic government, a United Ireland in 2017-2018 is a very real possibility.

He's not a DM, and he doesn't have the instinct of reading the play defensively, similarly to Allen.

Also it would mean Lovren or Johnson at center back which is another worry.

I'd probably ditch 3-4-3 without Lucas, and play the 4-4-2 diamond with Coutinho behind Sterling and Sturridge. But then again who would play at the bottom of the diamond?

**The IT Crowd:** The comedic adventures of a rag-tag group of technical support workers at a large corporation.

**Him &amp; Her:** An acutely observed, forensically honest, warts-and-all look at a working-class couple in their mid-20s.

**Being Human:** A werewolf, a vampire, and a ghost try to live together and get along.

**Shameless:** The story of a young group of siblings pretty much abandoned by their parents, surviving by their wits - and humor - on a rough Manchester council estate.

**My Mad Fat Diary:** Set in 1996 in Lincolnshire, the show tells the tragic and humorous story of a very troubled young girl Rae, who has just left a psychiatric hospital, where she has spent four months after attempting suicide, begins to reconnect with her best friend Chloe and her group, who are unaware of Rae's mental health and body image problems, believing she was in France for the past four months.

It's clearly not reasonable to foresee the injury in this case occurring with an adult. With a child, perhaps, although I think it unlikely.

I actually think he'd be exposed a little bit if left to cover it all on his own because he isn't a very mobile player at this point, so having someone next to him brings out his best.  Obviously he can do the job well still on his own as we saw last season when Gerrard was injured, but I think if our DM isn't very athletic and able to get all over the pitch from side to side very quickly then we'll be exposed at the back all over again playing 2 CBs.  It won't be as bad as Gerrard holding, but there will still be big spaces opening up.

We have more attacking players with this formation than we do in a traditional 4-3-3 because we're able to bring our wing backs very far up the pitch, plus one of the central midfielders is almost always pushing far forward as well.  Our players being unable to finish is one thing, the quality and frequency of their chances is the real important part.  We control games better for the most part now and create a few good chances a game, it's on the players to get better at finishing them.  We're averaging about 16 shots per game with 6 on target, I think we should be scoring more often with that kind of chances created.  That's not related to the formation, it's related to the players themselves.

[Here's a blog post](http://www.cearta.ie/2015/01/any-attempt-to-prosecute-irish-publication-of-charlie-hebdo-mohammed-cartoons-is-doomed-to-fail/) on the matter by a law professor explaining why the cartoons don't breach the blasphemy law. I've seen several legal experts make the same points in the last few weeks. The law exists in order to meet a constitutional requirement that there be a law against blasphemy, but the current law was intentionally written to define blasphemy so narrowly that a conviction would be almost impossible. Even if it could be proven that the cartoons offended a great many Irish Muslims, and that it was Charlie Hebdo's intent to cause mass offence with the cartoons, the law still protects speech that has ""genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value"". The cartoons very clearly have political value, probably artistic value too, ergo they are protected regardless.

Both groups interviewed for this article have an interest in maintaining the fiction that the cartoons are illegal. The Islamic Cultural Centre clearly want to scare people off from publishing them. On the other hand, Atheist Ireland want to put pressure on the government to remove the reference to blasphemy from the constitution, so they're trying to make the law appear worse than it is. If the writer of this article had actually bothered to ask an impartial legal expert about this matter they would most likely have received a different viewpoint. 

We absolutely should get rid of the reference to blasphemy in the constitution, not because it is preventing free speech, but because it's pointless while doing the country reputational damage.",null,0,null,1423447708,null,0,1423448068,0,cofk7p8,null,t3_2v8q4e,null,t1_cofk7p8,null,t3_2v8q4e,null,null,null,null,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,daytickle,null,null,null,"**TL;DR:** If you get a chance, learn about the club and not just the current team: Shankly = God; Learn about The Spion Kop and fan culture; Liverpool won lots of cups from 1964-1990; learn about Hillsborough and Heysel; Liverpool haven't been that great since 1990 but we're getting there; I get carried away.

If you want a break from learning about offside rules, transfer windows and false nines, spend some time learning about the club itself and the city and how we got to where we are today. For me it's this that sets Liverpool apart from other teams (though we've won loads of big silver shiny things along the way, which is nice!)  
  
Bill Shankly is the place to start and will help you understand much more about LFC than any other player, manager or match ever could. He spoke of a Holy Trinity at Liverpool: the manager, the players and the supporters and the bond between those three is much stronger at Liverpool than anywhere else I've ever come across.  
  
""Shanks"" came to Liverpool in 1959 when we were languishing in the 2nd division and he described Anfield as ""The biggest toilet in Liverpool"". He was a proud Scotsman but developed an instant bond with the city and people of Liverpool and built the club up and up into ""a bastion of invincibility"". Everything you see here now from the all-red kit, the colours and the singing of the fans in the Spion Kop (the innovators in fan culture), to the massive trophy cabinet all stems from Shanks. He modernised the stadium, the training ground, built the best team in England from scratch (twice), took us to the first division and made us champions of England within 2 years. When he spoke, he had everybody hanging on his every word. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH5W_yMftIM) is from just after we lost a cup final. Just imagine what it was like after we'd won.
  
He was (and still is) a God in Liverpool, more so than any other, even Gerrard or Dalglish. He quit football unexpectedly in 1974, but left behind a team that went on to dominate all of Europe for the next 10 years, with Shanks' assistant Bob Paisley taking over and winning 20 trophies in 9 seasons!  
  
Once you're done with Shanks and Paisley, learn about Joe Fagan (another member of Shanks' staff) who took over in 1983 and won the treble (3 trophies in one season) in his first year!  
  
This will then take you into the mid-late 80s, where we were still the best team in England, but were banned from European football following the [Heysel Stadium disaster] (http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/heysel) in 1985, where 39 Juventus supporters died when a stadium wall collapsed during fighting between the Liverpool and Juve fans. 
  
4 years later, on 15th April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at the FA Cup semi-final at [Hillsborough](http://hfdinfo.com/digital/) Stadium. The police, along with the national press (learn about [the boycott of The Sun](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17113382), which stands to this day) tried to pin the blame on the Liverpool fans, claiming they were drunk and violent, turned up without tickets and tried to force their way in to the stadium. This has since been proven to all be untrue, and in September 2012 the [Hillsborough Independent Panel report] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229038/0581.pdf) (link is just there for interest, I don't expect you to read all 400 pages - even I haven't and it's been out over 2 years!) found that an inadequate stadium and poor policing were to blame, and that South Yorkshire police worked together with Thatcher's Conservative government of the time to cover up the true causes and pin the blame on Liverpool fans. It was only the 20+ year fight from the people of Liverpool and the different Hillsborough Justice groups which allowed any of this to come out - and there's currently a major inquest going on into how and why the cover up was allowed to happen.    
 

Back to football, ""King"" Kenny Dalglish was player-manager from 1986 until 1991 and won loads, but he resigned due to post-traumatic stress following what he had seen at Hillsborough and in the aftermath.   
  
Another former player Graeme Souness took over as manager and made some terrible signings causing Liverpool to drop from 1st/2nd every year to 6th/8th. He was sacked and Roy Evans (another of Shankly's old staff) took over. He had the side playing some good football, but following the creation of the Premier League and the influx of mega-money into the game from Sky Sports, the players were getting paid more and more and became much more powerful within the club. Evans was too nice and got taken advantage of by these new multi-millionaire footballers (at Liverpool they earned  the nickname the Spice Boys as they acted like pop-stars) and Evans unfortunately couldn't bring back the success of the golden age.  
  
Liverpool looked abroad for a foreign manager who could get rid of the Spice Boys and bring in a new style of football. Gerard Houllier got Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League (new name for the European Cup) and won 5 trophies in one season - 2000-2001. Later that year he had a heart-attack during a match against Leeds, and when he came back he was never the same again, playing dull football and not getting results. He was replaced by Rafa Benitez in 2004, who did quite well in his first season (watch the Istanbul link earlier on in this thread for more details!) and made Liverpool a dominant force in Europe again, being ranked #1 in Europe in 2009.  
  
Liverpool were taken over by American owners Tom Hicks and George Gilette in 2007, who started well, buying players like Javier Mascherano and Fernando Torres. They soon started to treat Liverpool like a cash cow though, selling any good players and replacing them with cheaper options and keeping the profits for themselves. Benitez fought a constant battle against them for years trying to be successful regardless, but was eventually sacked in 2010.  
  
The Liverpool fans eventually got sick of these owners using and abusing *their* club and formed a supporters union, called the Spirit of Shankly (yeah, him again!) which held protests and demonstrations against the owners and targeted key sponsors, getting them to pull out funding and stop Hicks and Gilette making any profits. Hicks and Gilette were eventually forced out (selling at a loss! :D) after court cases and all sorts of madness and replaced by Fenway Sports Group (they also own the Boston Red Sox) - more Americans, but these actually seemed to care about the club, and got rid of Roy Hodgson (Hicks and Gilette's ""yes-man"" replacement for Benitez) and brought back King Kenny.

He wasn't quite as successful as the first time around, but got us on the right track, before stepping aside for Brendan Rodgers, the current manager who last season took us as close to the title as we've been for 24 years. Anyway, there's loads of stuff on this sub about him, so I won't bore you further - I only meant this to be a short post about Shankly and ended up getting a bit carried away.

Honestly his technical ability is nowhere near as bad as you seem to think, you seem to be judging him entirely on shooting, which leaves a little to be desired, but hes getting better and better.

The reason his completed passes are lower than others is because he passes forward against teams trying to break them down. stats don't tell the whole story.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"I was there and actually sat on his side of the pitch in the first half, so I got a pretty good look at him. This was my first time seeing him in person, or even paying particular attention to him. I don't watch MLS much, so I've hardly seen anything of him from his time at Seattle. Anyhow, my thoughts:

Overall, his performance was somewhere between pedestrian and underwhelming. He was the right back in what looked most of the time like a 4-4-2. I heard we were listed on the lineup card as 4-2-3-1 and there was a spell early in the second half when we looked like a 3-5-2 with Yedlin as a wing back, but most of the time he played well back on the right hand side.

Defensively, he started quite roughly, and gave away the ball a few times in the first five minutes; he even sent a backpass to the keeper out for a corner. He settled down after that and grew into the game somewhat. He had a handful of decent defensive plays, stopping a few runs down the wing by Panama. He also lost his man a few times, although nothing much came of it and his pace allowed him to get back to where he needed to be. Overall, his task was fairly simple because Panama didn't attack down that side much. I don't recall him really having to dig in against attacking players in the corner or having to block corners; nor was he badly beaten by an attacker at any point that I can recall.

Offensively, there really isn't much to speak of. I didn't note an overlap with the winger in front of him--Zardes--until the 16th minute, and I can only recall two crosses that he put in, though one of them was quite good. He did have one fairly long ball ahead that Altidore pulled down and made something of. In possession, he was generally safe with the ball. Panama's press wasn't especially intense on his side and didn't trouble him much, although most of his passes were sideways. Jones was the central defender on his side and he appeared more comfortable with the ball anyway, so Yedlin was usually happy to hand it off to him to bring out. Yedlin made very few runs forward of any kind.

If his performance was a bit underwhelming--I never got a good look at his famed pace, and don't recall him really opening up the throttle at all--it's also worth noting that he appeared to have instructions to play a fairly safe game. Zardes, the winger in front of him, was easily man of the match: he was all over Panama's defense, creating space with his runs, playing balls through to his teammates. One could argue that Yedlin's conservatism enabled Zardes's attacking freedom, and I think that's fair. 

In the second half, Yedlin was on the opposite corner of the pitch, and it was a lot harder to see how he was doing. He did appear to continue playing a fairly conservative game from where I was, but I've read others say that he was getting better as the game went on. Unfortunately, he was injured on one of the few forays he made down the pitch into attack. The net was exactly between me and him when he was hurt, so I didn't see if it was a tackle, a hamstring, or whatever, but he was there for several minutes before going directly to the bench with a pretty obvious limp.

So, I was hoping to see a lot worth reporting, but I just didn't. I don't think he was bad, but his impact on the game was not great. ",null,0,null,1423452811,null,0,false,0,cofmzey,null,t3_2v8ipb,null,t1_cofmzey,null,t3_2v8ipb,null,null,null,null,null,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10,null

""Boy im not meaning to be rude but you couldnt be more wrong. Lamela does have alot of talent yes, but speed? Not really.


I don't think England suits him all that much. He's not that physical.
This is also a pretty common misconception that people who dont watch him play every game make. His physicality is not the problem, he is actually brilliant at shielding the ball when he has it and doesnt get outmuscled often at all.


He is so complicated i dont even know where to start. First of all he is not a winger and he will never be one. He plays best when he is the playmaker playing in the number 10 role. But we know that he wont succed their for us atleast since we already have Eriksen. So he needs to make his wing play work as good as possible


Everytime he gets the ball on the right flank he does jack shit, refuses to take on his man and go on the outside to put a cross in, and for some reason isnt willing to use his dribbling skills either. The times when we actually see him create a oppertunity is when he roams the pitch. His biggest strength is his vision, he can pick out a final pass as good as Eriksen but he cant do it from the right wing. So almost every time that he gets the ball in the right, he cuts inside then gets crowded by players and plays it sideways.


Then we also have his confidence, which is jack shit. For example, at the start of the season when he was playing 5-6 matches straight in the PL and was playing pretty good he couldnt emulate and build on it at all. He stagnated completly, afraid of doing the things we need him to do. We need him to be our flair player, that is going to atempt the things that no one else on the team is capable of. But he keeps questioning himself. Taking the easy route all to much and not taking any responsibility to create a chance. He almost plays like a 3rd central midfielder, and the wierd thing is that is fucking good at it. But the problem is that we dont need him to do that, we need him to create going forward.


Then the second part of his confidence problems comes when he has been dropped or injuried for a couple of games. Then he tries to hard to make a inpact. He can really look silly at times, he runs his ass of and probably works harder then any other player on the pitch. But without any result, countless of idiotic sliding tackles that completly miss player and ball and stupid fouls. Also these games are the ones where he actually wants to make an impact and wants to create, but what ends up happening is since he has been dropped for example he has literally no confidence at all and just dwells on the ball to much.


Its all a vicious evil circle for him. And the biggest problems are in his head. You can notice that Pochettino really wants him to succed and tries to get him going but he just isnt mentally strong enough to emulate any kind of real form. The talent is their, he just has no clue how to make it happend for himself.
Hope any of this make some sense and you get a insight of his problems. Sorry if it got a litle sloppy with the grammer/spelling, English isnt my first language.""

Cultural norms change through the times:


http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Age_of_consent

&gt; In the 12th century, Gratian, the influential founder of Canon law in medieval Europe, accepted age of puberty for marriage to be between 12 and 14 but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than 7. There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. It should be noted that Judges honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than 7, in spite of what Gratian had said; there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds.[3]

&gt; The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only 9 when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) ""made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old.""[3]",null,0,null,1423453250,null,0,false,0,cofn7fv,null,t3_2v7h7k,null,t1_cofn7fv,null,t1_cofcj3l,null,null,null,null,null,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7,null

He may well face legitimate charges in Sweden (though two of the witnesses at least brought their cases in somewhat suspicious circumstances, at least one seems to genuinely feel they were mistreated and that's fair enough) but the issue is with extradition.

The US has an outstanding warrant for Assange due to his activities with wikileaks. Sweden have claimed that they would not hand him over to the US if he would face the death penalty or ""unusual punishment"" but a) what unusual punishment means can vary a lot, b) the US can exert a remarkable amount of pull potentially even enough to sway Sweden, and c) if he surrendered to Swedish authorities he would pretty much be at their mercy if factors a and b come into play.

The thing that makes me more sympathetic to Assange is that though he does not have an arrest out in Sweden, and is merely ""sought for questioning"", his offer to answer questioning remotely or with a Swedish official in the embassy where he is staying has been summarily refused. Sweden has made it clear that they have no interest in dealing with him until he's on Swedish soil.

It's not unreasonable that he would see that as a gambit to get him into a position where he would be arrested and extradited for his ""offences"" in the US.

TL;DR Assange should probably answer the charges in Sweden but I totally get why he won't go there to do so.",null,0,null,1423453252,null,0,false,0,cofn7hj,null,t3_2v7czk,null,t1_cofn7hj,null,t1_cofh7zf,null,null,null,null,null,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7,null

Your windfall, plough that into the most expensive debt. Don't worry about having a emergency fund just yet. Odds of you having a genuine emergency are low and it will cost you interest. Martin explains it better than me: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/pay-off-debts

From what I'm reading in your post, you're doing everything sensibly. Do you have a debt free date or any milestone dates? Might want to have those as motivational targets.

If you have a spare £20 or whatever the day before payday, throw that at a credit card, but keep paying what you're paying, don't use it as an excuse to cut back. You'll be surprised what difference 'chipping away' can make as well as the big payments.

Look forward to your end game. I was in debt not so long ago, not to your level, but I thought 'fuck this'  and threw money at the problem until it vanished. For the past year, I've been skint. But only because I've been **saving** very aggressively (basically still ploughing every penny I had into savings instead of debt). I now have enough to get a mortgage (yay, more debt!) and saving has become **addictive**. I almost have a reverse problem of just never buying anything and having to force myself to buy little luxuries here and there once I had hit my saving goal. Recently I've had to force myself to think 'it's okay, you can have this, you can afford it'. A nice problem to have, in a way. I'll find a happy medium point soon.

Learn the lessons from this. You've proven you to yourself you can live on a fair chunk less than you earn. Don't fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation and thinking you can spend all your money. Live comfortably, but fuck the Joneses if they have a nicer car. Get into good habits with money now and keep them.

I am amazed that you think his technical ability is poor. He plays a great long ball, has a good first touch, and is a pretty good passer. Completed pass percentages are such an overrated statistic and finishing is not a very big deal for a deeper positioned midfielder.

Tackling and work rate are pretty important parts of the game and Mason is great at them. Not only that, he is extremely smart and I think that that is such an underrated part of the game. Who cares if he wouldn't start for another top team. He fits Poch's system perfectly and that is something shouldnt be taken for granted. We look much better with him on the pitch. 

Also, I find it laughable that you think Michael Bradley is a better player than him. Absolute joke of a comment. Oh, I'm American so I don't have any hate for the guy for what its worth.

In 2006 I watched my first World Cup and I only remembered 4 names from it:

Ballack

Ronaldinho

Zidane

Drogba

So when I looked them up, knowing nothing about anything regarding soccer, I saw that two of the 3 guys I really liked played for Chelsea, so I became a Chelsea ""fan"" in name only. I was only 12 and didn't pay attention to much soccer anyway but if anybody asked I would say I liked Chelsea because of those two guys. As an aside, I couldn't stand Zidane for a while because I thought he was just some hot headed idiot, so I disliked him and Madrid, but Ronaldinho was so happy on the field and was so fun to watch that I liked Barcelona. Once I started learning more about soccer and found out how wrong I was about Zidane, I went pretty neutral on Madrid and can't say enough good things about Zidane and really regret not being able to watch him live in his prime. I still love(d) Ronaldinho but I am pretty anti-barcelona at this point.

Then the 2010 World Cup happened and I got completely sucked in and ditched the NFL and Madden for MLS, EPL, anything else I could find, and FIFA. I when I started really getting into it, I jumped into supporting Chelsea and found that they were really good and felt lucky to have chosen a good team, because most of my sports teams were not good or just horrifically unlucky during my sports-life.

I totally get it when people call me plastic or say I'm not a true fan, being that I'm a 20 year old American who just so happens to be supporting one of the best clubs in the world over the last 10 years, and have never been to London, let alone England. I get it, but that doesn't mean I agree. I consistently get up at 4:30 AM to watch Chelsea play and am saving up for a trip to london to see them play at the beginning of the 2015/2016 season. I feel like a loyal and dedicated fan because I can't imagine supporting any other team in the EPL, but I don't think I'll feel ""fulfilled"" as a true fan until I can say I've been to the Bridge and sung 'Carefree'.

I would suggest doing something like Whinlatter in the morning and the pencil museum in the afternoon - with a trip to a tea room for a cream tea and scones in the middle. Or substitute the outdoor activity with Lowther Castle if its raining.

This won't need GPS or GSM to operate, it just transmits a signal which can home in on using a receiver and high gain antenna.

I do a bit of model rocketry and the one I use was originally designed for falconry. It weighs around 10grams and the tiny button-cell battery will broadcast for a week.

It has pretty good range as well. With UK ...

* 40-50 miles if its in the air (direct line of sight)
* ~10 miles if on the ground but elevated (hanging in a tree)
* 1-2 miles if on open ground (landed in a field)
* I've not tested, but if it lands in the middle of a built up area you're still probably fucked (too many reflections)

The system was a bit pricey, 10 years ago when I bought it the whole lot cost something like £200 (two transmitters, receiver, antenna). But it's damn reliable and weighs next to nothing (which is important with rocketry, probably not so much with ballooning).

You can DIY it easy enough though if you're on a budget and know anything about electronics.

---

I'd use the transmitter as a backup and your GPS/GSM as your primary tracking method, if the GPS system works it's far easier as you don't have to worry about search grids or triangulation you just walk right up to where it says it is.

If the GPS fails you get to whip out the massive antenna and [pretend you're David Attenborough or something](http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/assets/img/epidemics-koalas/image-04-large.jpg)

About the current season, we'll have to go back to the past summer. 4 key players and a promising youngster left the club, 3 of the 5 being academy graduates. Also Pochetino our previous manager left as well. It seemed like the sky was falling and many in the media picked us as prime candidates for relegation. Instead we came out strong and sit 3rd in the league fighting for a champions league position.

As for key players, Fonte is our captain at centerback and brings order to our back line, which currently is the best defense in the league. Though part of that success in defense is due to the likes of Morgan Schneiderlin who plays in a holding midfield role. He's probably our best player and almost left during the summer, it's doubtful we'll keep him this summer though. Currently Morgan is coming back from injury. What he adds to our game is a presence in midfield to stop counter attacks in their tracks and also provides an outlet to build out of the back. 

Up front our main man is Graziano Pelle. Big target man who holds up play, he's had a drop in form recently, but we really don't have a replacement for him.

Lastly our fullbacks have been key to our success this season. I have never seen a team rely so much on its fullbacks to move forward.

Also about buying merch, Southampton doesn't have a kit deal so they make everything in house. So if you want gear you'll have to order from the saints official store and pay extra for overseas shipping.

USA (Florida) here! I loved sports and sport video games like Madden and 2K, but didn't know shit about  soccer. I kept hearing about how good FIFA was both from friends in real life and people on the internet. I bought it despite knowing jack shit about soccer about a month before the 2014 World Cup (I know, I know - I'm a really really new fan). Well I spent most of that summer watching the World Cup and playing FIFA and my love for the sport grew. 

Now in that time I had no favorite club team, so I would play a lot of quick matches against my friends and brother playing as national teams and random clubs with high ratings. One day I happened to play as the Belgian National team and instantly fell in love with Eden Hazard. He ran like a cheetah and was as agile as gazelle. Belgium became my team of choice and I could consistenly score hat tricks with Hazard against my friends. 

At about this time I discovered /r/soccer and started researching the history of the sport online. I found out that Eden played for the London club Chelsea was delighted to learn that the Belgian goalkeeper Courtois played for them also! I spent a lot of time on youtube watching Jose Mourinho videos and fell in love with his antics and sense of humor (not to mention his suave style). I eventually learned all the ins and outs of the Chelsea lineup and started waking up early every Saturday to catch the Chelsea game. For Christmas I got a Chelsea shirt, beanie, and even some Chelsea pajama pants! It's nice that I can tell my story on this sub without getting any hate.

Since you'll be working it I recommend practising the following to help you fit in like a native:

1. Yelling at groups of tourists who insist on filling the whole width of the pavement (sidewalk) and walking really slowly, occasionally stopping to take photos 

2. Develop a face that says 'why the Hell would I want a leaflet about your high school' s rewriting of Sondheim?' If anyone does offer you a leaflet just give the a patronising 'really?' look and walk on by

3. Get buses just so you can tut loudly everytime a tourist gets on and doesn't have the correct change or doesn't know where the bus goes and thinks the driver is tourist information. (Buses are £1.50 single and £3.50 for an all day ticket, they're pretty good if you need to get between venues that are a distance between)

null,false,natoed,null,null,null,"*sigh* You know what I am not a Muslim , I was a Christian now, agnostic and I think these people are right . Racism in the name of ""satire"" is just as bad as any other kind of racism . Remember that Charlie Hebdo fired a cartoonist for making an anti-Semitic cartoon in 2012 or 2013 .  The way that Mohamed and Muslims have been portrayed by CH is far beyond just satire or poking fun .  

Making fun of a society or the actions of terrorists is one thing , mocking that they did it the the name of religion  fine ; but doing so with a sense of moral superiority and self righteousness is another matter . 

With freedom of speech you also have responsibility . The Situation in France is very different than in the UK for Muslims . When French Muslims wanted to have a peaceful protest about CH it was shut don by Paris Police quite harshly too . When ordinary citizens attempted to use the system it was closed down to them . There are huge areas of Paris suburbs that are like the gulags in Poland during WWII where refugees from french Colonies are shoved without any help to find work or gain full citizenship . Add that to the mix islamaphobia that is currently running though France (it's scary to think that Front National has wide spread support from Muslim communities in the towns where they won the mayor ships due to the way other political parties have ignored issues) . Then you get interlingual elitism in some of the ""liberal"" media abusing the freedom of speech while you as a group are denied such freedoms (such as to protest peacefully) . It becomes a melting pot of hatred and fractured to the point where radical elements will take   action just as in the case of CH .

What happened at CH should never have been allowed to occur it was not a fault of any one party and is a disgraceful act that was condemned by the French Muslim population (rightly so) even though they have been shouted down previously when protesting against CH.   

This is an issue all countries in the ""enlightened West"" need to consider . Where do we go from here? Do we realize that our irreverence towards religion should become the worlds standard ? That walking over other peoples believes are justified by the cry of freedom of speech only when it suits us? 

Imagine that the CH cartoons were aimed at extremists in the LGBT community that call heterosexuals and bisexuals ""breeders"" (there are a very small minority that do my sister who is lesbian has met them ) . What do you think the reaction from the LGBT community would be ? 

The ""west"" has an incredible ability to become blind of it's own hypocrisy . It has a faux liberal society made up of those who are turning the population into sociopaths and narcissists who care neither of  feelings of others but are more interested in self glorification of their ""liberal"" identity.

I don't have a particular say over what goes on in most of the liberal democratic West, but for me to claim the US, France or Germany has ""nothing to do with me"" would be preposterous. On a smaller level I don't like the political values of the Daily Mail or the Sun, but they are indisputably part of British or English culture, which being my culture also makes the something to do with me.

&gt; I'd love to see a million-strong march of British Muslims decrying ISIS, Al-qaeda, terrorism, anti-semitism, homophobia, misogyny and FGM. I'd love it. But I also recognise that harassing individual Muslims because of the actions of others isn't really fair.

Are individual Muslims morally responsible for what happens in the Middle East on a daily basis? Obviously not. But the reason you won't see that million strong march against all the above is that most strains of Islam do inculcate illiberal, backwards values in people, just the same as Catholicism in Ireland (see laws on abortion, gay marriage etc) and Evangelical Christianity in the US (see the same).

No they chose politics, this is how it works. They were the minority partner in the coalition, which means they wouldn't be able to enact their manifesto. All they can do is influence the party with the majority - which they did. 

If they had got a majority, and then voted for a tuition fee increase then I'd agree with you. But they didn't, what they did do was work out a better deal for students. If you hadn't voted for them, they wouldn't have been able to do that. So your vote for the Lib Dems has infact helped students. 

Also no party can 100% guarantee their manifesto, it has to go through a vote in parliament - so if the other parties voted against a policy it wouldn't get through. Punishing that party and suggesting they lied because they weren't able to enact a policy is just a really ignorant reaction to the political process.

I have been following Kane for some years and he didn't do anywhere near as bad on those loan spells as is made out by people. So Ill post his stats and you can judge again for yourself.

**Millwall**: 19starts 9goals 5assists (won Millwall young player of the season)

**Leicester**: 5starts 2goals (His main problem at Leicester is that their manager at the time kept playing him on the left-wing as he didn't trust Kane to lead the line)

**Leyton Orient**: 10starts 5goals

**Norwich**: 1start 1assist (5 appearances total and he's judged on this?!)

Kane has literally scored consistently whenever he has been played as a Striker wherever he has gone, his main problem has been getting game time on these loans. No manager seemed to want to play him regularly other than the Millwall manager.

He also has 8 goals in 10 games for the England U21s.

The officers staffing the protests won't have been standing around waiting for work to come in, they will have been abstracted from response teams that are already running minimum strength (which is a low, low number).

Unless the organisers can share some of the burden, it becomes the case that there are simply no resources to manage the march. 

The choice is simple - staff the protests and miss emergency calls/neglect the neighbourhoods, or tell the protesters no and take the calls/do the neighbourhood work. It's not some sort of insidious plot to crack down on dissent, it's simple numbers.

I don't have a problem with Zouma being given the chance, as such, but there are a lot of people shouting for him to take over from Cahill without even thinking about the way Mourinho works. 

Zouma is, despite recent performances, still rough around the edges. He doesn't carry the ball that well and he's flat-footed from standing. He's _much_ better when he doesn't have time to think. That's why I'd be surprised to see Mourinho replace Cahill with him this season.

The power of protest should not be diminished because of cuts. 

One of the reasons this country is great is the ability to protest. Making it only for people who can afford it is ridiculous.  The people hardest hit are normally the poorest who can't afford to protest.  They are removing their voice.

You can't sever your links with your childhood as an adult but you can be aware of them (as I am sure most religious adults are). I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. I grew up in quite a religious family and a lot of happy, important, and meaningful moments of my childhood happened at church or church camp.

null,false,domalino,BnW,,null,"Respectfully Song is exactly the kind of player we _shouldn't_ be signing IMO. 

Firstly on a quality level - he's a good player in a good West Ham team. He's shown at Arsenal and Barça that he can't take that step up to the next level. He lacks the discipline and focus to play at the very top, even West Ham fans who love him will tell you he is often sloppy and makes huge mistakes - he almost gave away a terrible goal yesterday with a horrendous backpass that got intercepted, but was saved by Kouyate. He's lazy in his tracking back, and West Ham rely on having Noble and Nolan do an incredible amount of running to make up for it. 

Secondly in regards to our squad, he wouldn't fit in. Song's low workrate means he needs to be part of a 3 man midfield - Pellegrini won't play that, he never has and is pretty stubborn over his tactics. He won't even play Yaya further forward like you suggested because it means losing either silva or Nasri. 

In the wider scheme of things he'd come in and be a squad player. He'd do a job, but he wouldn't be a starter. We really don't need those players at the moment. What we need is a big, marquee signing that instantly raises the level of the starting 11, and leaves a current starter on the bench unless they raise their game. That's what we lack really that Chelsea have, real competition. Our best players lately have been Clichy and Milner, the only two who are actually fighting for their places. Hart had it early on from willy, and his game went up. Dzeko and Negredo were in a fight last year and they were both fantastic.

The set up the GMG have, is clearly not an accident, it's cleared design the minimize the tax liabilities, but it is perfectly legal unless someone finds a document like these HSBC whistleblower provided, that demonstrate how it was designed with this avoidance in mind, then it would make the GMG criminal evasion, which many would argue it is obviously already.  This is where my disdain for GMG on this matter comes in, because they print any wonk complaining about Amazon or similar, even if they've used utter nonsensical accounting to get to their numbers.

It's a narrow line between having perfectly legal avoidance, and criminal evasion.

You appear to not my rational, which this is a supplier consumer relationship.  Being the supplier, it's useful to have a regular consumer, a regular consumer is about being able to plan your 'business' around it, it makes it very easy.  If I was a whore, I'd want that, it would be worth losing money by giving a discount to the regulars too.

However, the consumer on the other hand, as we both agree clearly isn't just wanting a bit of flesh.  This, I think is where the hazard comes into play most.  They are having this 'pet' this 'sex toy' yet they are clearly wanting things to be longer.  Ok, having a monogamous mistress is hardly a new idea, and has obvious practical benefits from safer sex side of things, but in this situation I think it would be bad.

My personal opinion is he attacked Jimmy Carr because it was a shrewd political move and then dodged the questions on Gary Barlow because he's an open Tory supporter.

Tax avoidance (i.e. not tax evasion) is not illegal, but it is morally wrong in the eyes of many. There's nothing wrong with a PM saying he believes someone's acts are morally wrong, even if they are not illegal, what was bad is how he picked sides.

As for how people found out I vaguely remember an undercover reporter speaking to an accountancy firm that was advising people on the K2 tax avoidance scheme. I think he mentioned it was how Jimmy Carr did it, and thus the accusation was made.

The fact is though that while Carr was lambasted by the coalition government for avoiding paying tax, a whole host of Tory supporters and donors do exactly the same thing and none of them were attacked by the government.

Consider also the phone hacking scandal. That originally broke in 2005 with hacking the phones of members of the royal family. It ran through 2006, went away, resurfaced in 2009, went away, and then came back in 2011, resurfacing with the ""discovery"" of a notebook, just a matter of weeks before News Corporation was due to make the biggest acquisition in it's history.

The fallout from which not only scotched the BSkyB acquisition, but shuttered the News of the World.

Now I have little to no sympathy for Rupert Murdoch, and I try to always avoid the tin-foil hat interpretation of such events. But for that saga - which ran on for *years* - to come to a head *right before* he was about to make a major acquisition strikes me as more than just coincidence - someone was sitting on those details and was suppressing it until it was convenient to release it for maximum impact.

And similarly, someone had the dirt on Carr's tax arrangements and would have held onto them until there was a swell of anti-tax-avoidance stuff in the news, and released it just when they judged it to have maximum effect.

If they'd just released the Carr story when it came to their attention, then it probably wouldn't have been a big deal - embarrassing but of no consequence. It might even have been buried by other news. By saving it for a slow news day, when there was a glut of other such stories coming through, it creates a critical mass. Cameron didn't break his trip *just* for Jimmy Carr, but because there was a swell of opinion on the topic that more broadly called for a response.

What I have heard about them is they tend to agree a price with you and once you do turn up with the car there is a lot of tire kicking involved and they will knock their quoted price down for all sorts of minor things.

Aston Villa Review: Episode 108 - Villa lose to Chelsea with a big week coming up
Aston Villa finally carved out a Premier League goal - at home, no less - but Branislav Ivanovic's winner guided Chelsea to a win at Villa Park, Jose Mourinho's first. In this week's show, Chris and Steve assess the damage from the latest addition to Villa's winless run and ask whether Christian Benteke's contribution is now small enough to justify Gabriel Agbonlahor's use at centre forward in this week's games.

The first of those is with us as soon as Tuesday. Villa visit Hull City, arguably the only team in the division worse than Villa until they snared a point at the Etihad over the weekend. We preview that game as well as the FA Cup Fifth Round match at home against Leicester City.

So when with Bentaleb he's the more attacking the majority of the time due to him gliding past players, keeping possession while on the ball, having a pretty good final ball and me being stubborn on his ability to shoot (I swear he has the potential ability to be in double figures for goals every season). Bentaleb can hang back and ping balls in (like the cross for Kane) with Dem on the edge ready to bang them in if they roll out/in the box (pretty sure he should be good in the air too). Mason they share attacking/defending more evenly, both can get stuck in and do the dirty work but Mason is more forward thinking than Bentaleb. Obviously when further up he's quite a bit more attacking.

I'm still undecided on Lamela/Townsend. Both can be good and have potential, Townsend for more width. I'd like to see one of those missing out if Dem goes further up with Eriksen on the pitch, iirc that hasn't happened yet because Dem's only been playing further up for a few games. Imo Chadli's the best winger this season and by a good margin, he can rotate either side with Eriksen being a little on the left/central, Dem has spent a bit of time out wide as well as the middle.

&gt;During the early 2000s Private Eye published many stories on the MMR vaccine controversy, substantially supporting the interpretation by Andrew Wakefield of published research in The Lancet by the Royal Free Hospital's Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group, which described an apparent link between the vaccine, autism and bowel problems. Many of these stories accused medical researchers who supported the vaccine's safety of having conflicts of interest because of funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Initially dismissive of Wakefield, the magazine rapidly moved to support him, in 2002 publishing a 32-page MMR Special Report that supported Wakefield's assertion that MMR vaccines ""should be given individually at not less than one year intervals."" The British Medical Journal issued a contemporary press release[18] that concluded: ""The Eye report is dangerous in that it is likely to be read by people who are concerned about the safety of the vaccine. A doubting parent who reads this might be convinced there is a genuine problem and the absence of any proper references will prevent them from checking the many misleading statements."" Subsequently, editor Ian Hislop told the author and columnist Ben Goldacre that Private Eye is ""not anti-MMR"".[19] In a review article published in February 2010, after Wakefield was disciplined by the General Medical Council, regular columnist Phil Hammond, who contributes under the pseudonym ""M.D."", stated that ""Private Eye got it wrong in its coverage of MMR"", in maintaining its support for Wakefield's position long after shortcomings in his work had emerged.[20]

I'm not going to put these exactly for obvious reason, but so far I've come up with:

* Trolling is an online cultural practice for comic effect that emphasises responding rather than reacting, just like IRL when somebody makes a 'bating' comment, invariably sometimes people react ignorantly and everybody laughs at them. It happens in every scene, subculture or group of friends, you act dumb, somebody takes the piss. What if we banned celebrity bashing by comedians or musicians too?. IRL circles this is called 'taking the piss' and to do so with anonymity on the internet with the same effect the words used appear bigger however still represent no threat. (it's hard to find a reference of people not getting offended by trolling, but I am relatively immune to it, my mum has been called a jew/nazi/hitler/cockburner before and I don't feel any negative side effects.)

* You would be using the same tools to peadophiles as people who are simply taking the piss; it's a bit heavy handed.

* Freedom of speech would be impacted and as a result the Streisand effect may occur

* Increased surveillance is enforced upon the UK's ISP's and their customers. Not very forward thinking.

* The cost of implementing this is not only a waste of money and parliament time but also of money and resources. The bureaucracy would be hard to bury once opened up for something as silly as somebody taking offence (this isn't 1914 Austria-Hungary)

* America may be making the internet a public utility and with our trade agreements and close association with them would it not be prudent to at least, at this time sync with the largest influence online, rather than begin to regulate what we can and can't hear for even our closest ally.

Ultimately, we've still pretty much got stone-age hunter gatherer brains, which are incredibly good if you're trying to escape from an angry bear or something, but which can't do statistics for shit, are full of cognitive biases and use heuristics all the time instead of solving difficult problems.  Daniel Kahnemann, who pretty much wrote the book on human irrationality and decision making, is [deeply pessimistic](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329820.200-understand-faulty-thinking-to-tackle-climate-change.html#.VNimLtb-_mE) about our ability to solve climate change.  I have to admit that I am too, especially when at a policy level it's dealt with in such a compartmentalised way, and given that our current economic system really, really likes producing textbook examples of the tragedy of the commons.  Climate change, economic growth, energy policy, pollution and so on are all essentially different sides of the same coin, yet there's very little whole system thinking being done trying to link them all together and figure out what to do.

The only real hope I see is that 1)  there probably isn't enough economically burnable carbon in the ground for us to get to the *really* nasty warming levels (5C or so), though this probably implies an economic collapse due to energy shortages within the century and 2)  the climate sensitivity might be in the low end of the range (say below 1.5C per CO2 doubling), although that still ignores all the other aerosols and greenhouse gases and other feedbacks, which still might be nasty.

Those of a pessimistic bent might enjoy the following [paper](http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/3/1/2012/esd-3-1-2012.html), which concludes that:

&gt; Effectively, it appears that civilization may be in a double-bind. If civilization does not collapse quickly this century, then CO2 levels will likely end up exceeding 1000 ppmv; but, if CO2 levels rise by this much, then the risk is that civilization will gradually tend towards collapse.

I think what makes the front 3 in poch's system so deadly is that the players constantly switch in and out of each others' positions, float around, drop back and run behind to create space and opportunities. In this system then, it's best to have the players who offer the most versatility, and Chadli and Dembele are big, quick, can defend and can effectively play the wing or inside. Plus, if you have a world class asset on your team you should always find a way to play and exploit it, and dembele's dribbling and ball control is that good IMO.

Compared to the amount of criticism you see of non-American cultures, criticism of Americanization is practically non-existent. I can't remember the last time a major political figure criticised American importations (I can remember a couple of politicians pandering to them though), nor can I remember a major newspaper doing the same. Arguably, America has had a much greater effect on British culture than any other culture in the world, which is why it baffles me when the staunch defenders of British culture tend to ignore it in lieu of attacking people from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 

&gt; Also odd that you'd think the whole of America is white?

The section of America that affects Britain most? They are mostly, if not entirely, white. I'd like to clarify that I'm not criticising them because they're white, rather that I believe their colour is one of the reasons why their actions, or the effects of their actions, are ignored.

First Allen isn't a DM and I think this sub is a bit unfair to him because he isn't defensively as good as Lucas.  That much is obvious.  When he was brought in it was press high, turn defense into attack and play smart, accurate passes.  Henderson took his job.  

Second he has had injury problems all year and not being in the side affects form.  I, like most of you, am not thrilled with his play this year.  I'm sure he isn't as well.  But you all make it sound like he is totally fucking terrible.  He has made mistakes, he can get pushed off the ball and does turn over the ball occasionally.  But he does press high and can nick the ball and start a counter well.  

Now to play Allen as a straight DM is not going to work.  Allen should probably be sent to man mark Eriksen.  Let Henderson roam in the middle and get help over the top from the two midfielders behind the striker.  Spurs use the flanks a lot so let them, shunt everything wide let Manquillo and Moreno track back.  

I really wish this was an away game so Liverpool could cede possession and hit them on the break.  

Also I don't like the idea of breaking up a back three that has been solid.  Maybe when Kolo is back they move Can but the idea of Lovren covering Kane doesn't bode well.

That doesn't really make his case any better.

&gt; The logical explanation is that he is afraid of going to Sweden for more reason than just the charges brought against him there. The obvious explanation is the US interest.

He can think that but he is wrong, and his supporters are idiots for going along with such an obviously bollocks line of reasoning that doesn't stand up to any scrutiny whatsoever. If he wishes to be paranoid that the US will snatch him up from Sweden - but not the UK for some reason - then that is his prerogative, but there is no reason at all for anyone else to agree with him.

There is only one line of reasoning which actually tallies with all the available evidence and stands up to any serious thought, and it is this: Julian Assange is hiding in the embassy because he does not wish to be on trial for rape/sexual misconduct/whatever and/or has paranoid delusions about being taken to the US and tortured.

His ability to distribute the ball positively, shield the defence through smart positioning and effective tackling, his work-rate and his desire make him my favourite player on the pitch, even when Harry Kane is around.

He gave us something in the middle which we have been missing since Modric left, efficient and creative distribution of the ball. When you watch us play without him our attacks are much more laborious and rely on Eriksen or Kane doing something special or come from rose or walker. With him on the pitch we start from deep, and we are more incisive and quicker. 

For such a young man he is so composed and confident, its incredible. 

He has become the pivot on which our team depends it is no surprise that our best performances of the season have come with him on the pitch. With all that money we spent on midfeilders we had this lad waiting in the wings the whole time.

On the fighting cock podcast, the other week someone said the best thing about watching Kane, Mason, Townsend and Bentaleb was the desire, determination and obvious love for the club. You can see it and it is driving the team now, and it makes the team so much better to watch and support, you can literally hear it at white heart lane.

Of course it was also an Openreach engineer that came out and hooked me up to Sky.

To get things moving for me it seemed to be a matter of having my connection request come in as a new order from a different ISP which somehow circumvented the bureaucracy that had becomes attached to my original order so maybe swapping ISP might be worth a shot?

The fact of the matter is ""Famous in the EU"" != ""World-wide fame"" much like ""TV Famous"" is not equal to a ""Huge Star.""  Can you honestly tell me you knew who George Clooney was back when he was on E.R before he was ""movie famous""?

Look at Simon Pegg - another actor who had a fair share of good roles but you'd be hard pressed to find someone outside of Europe who had heard of him before Shaun of the Dead.

Want to make a guess at why that is?  Try population and GDP.  The US has *six times* the population of the UK (310M to 61M) and a GDP almost 8 times as large (16.8 to 2.5).  It takes the top **5** EU members to match our population (Germany, France, UK,  Italy and Spain @ ~310M) and the *entire* EU to match our GDP.

Lets pretend that the threshold for ""fame"" is that 10% of a given population can recognize your face. In the UK that would mean 6M people know ""you"".  That's only 1.9% of the US or two people out of a hundred.  Flip that around for US famous and you have *31* million, which means every other person in the UK or (almost) everyone in Canada.",null,0,null,1423490479,null,0,false,0,cofybef,null,t3_2v80sl,null,t1_cofybef,null,t1_cofvrch,null,null,null,null,null,-5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-5,null
