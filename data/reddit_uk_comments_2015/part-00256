I went with my wife, dad, uncle and a good friend of ours to see Liverpool vs Toronto in 2012 (1-1 goal from Adam Morgan assisted by Raheem).

We (naturally) got a little shitfaced at the match and had a blast. This friend of ours, an English bloke and diehard Liverpool fan, got up the courage to go over the barrier at the end of the match, and walked right over to the bench. Apparently he was full of confidence, since security stopped and asked if he was allowed to be on the pitch, and he had no trouble convincing him that he was!

He walked over and shook hands with Agger, Spearing, Ibe, Wisdom and Morgan before cleverly making his way back into the stands.

 After the match, Ryan McLaughlin and Brad Jones came over to sign autographs for the couple dozen of us who had been waiting patiently for any sign of the players after the match. They were incredible friendly, and stuck around a while to chat etc. It was wonderful.

We were all on Cloud 9 after that, so naturally we decided to drink some more and go have fun on the town. We ended up at the Ritz Carlton trying to escape the sun in the car park, when a big bus drives up, and off the bus steps Ian Fucking Rush.

I don't remember exactly what happened, but next thing I remember I was at the bus shaking his hand, losing my words while trying to convey my appreciation for Rush being an absolute legend.

My buddy eventually realized who I was talking to and ran over, and basically repeated the exact same scenario as I had just done. One of the staff working at the hotel came over and told us that what we had done ""wasn't cool"" and was trying to get us to fuck off. Luckily the handsome Welshman had our backs and politely told the hotel prick to give us a break.

Firstly she was sent home becauae they claimed it was 'indegestion' and after a night of intense pain I drove her back whereupon they told her off again for crying in pain because it was annoying them.

Eventually (maybe 2 hours later) a doctor turned up who diagnosed gall stones and finally prescribed painkillers.

She was on a ward where all the nurses time was taken looking after a few patients with dementia.  They had no food she could eat (it was *all* spicy.  Even the mash was laced with pepper - she can't eat that normally let alone when she'd been told explicitly to stick to a light diet) so I had to bring her food in each day.  No sleep because the dementia patients were crying out day and night.
 
They kept her in for a fortnight then tried to discharge her with the drain tube still in... Noticed that at the last minute so sent her home with a half inch hole in her side and instructions to wash it.. Which became infected and required treatment by her GP.  Took more than a month in total and the scar is still there.

You need to narrow your definition of ""subsidy"". Are we talking about:

* Genuinely unprofitable companies that receive subsidies to keep above water (of which there will be very few), or

* Companies that receive government contracts (often with a spare zero on the end, because y'know, government work), or

* Companies that have received some sort of tax break, or

* Companies that have received loans or been bought out to provide liquidity (running out of money is different to being unprofitable), or

* Companies that have had government support/grants to offer their staff extra training or do extra R&amp;D on new export products, or

* Companies that have benefited from various government services?

For instance, in the last example, lots of international trade fairs will have a ""UK Pavilion"" paid for by UKTI where smaller companies who can't afford a big stand of their own can buy a booth at a cut rate and market their product to export markets.

For instance, at [Bauma 2016](http://www.bauma.de), companies like JCB or Perkins will exhibit independently on stands &gt;100sq.m. which cost tens of thousands of Euros *just for the floor space* before you fly any staff out, put together any displays or exhibits or pay for customer/prospect hospitality. If you run a small, specialist outfit making pumps or washers or something, you don't have a show budget of €250k, but you could grab a booth on the [UKTI Pavilion](http://www.thecea.org.uk/download/bauma-munich-2016-cea-uk-pavilion-pod-terms/) for maybe €3-7k.

That could be considered to be a subsidy, but it's also clearly a beneficial thing to support small companies and grow our export markets, because added together, all those little suppliers employ far more people than the big hitters like JCB, Rolls Royce or JLR.",null,0,null,1436173018,null,0,1436177752,0,cstncx3,null,t3_3c8lon,null,t1_cstncx3,null,t3_3c8lon,null,null,null,1437624433,null,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6,null

The majority of the cost is going to be swallowed up by the specialist tradesmen and materials you need to work on that sort of building - master craftsmen, stone-masons, specialist joiners with experience working on historic buildings and restorations, not to mention the cost of materials - replacing big blocks of stone is *much* more expensive per square metre than replacing pre-fab wall panels. The main cost is dealing with the building's physical structural integrity, and those costs are identical whether it's remains our seat of government or is re-purposed.

The good news is with all our historic cathedrals and National Trust properties, we do have quite a lot of those specialists available in the UK, but they're still going to cost far more than the equivalent steel erector.

Looking at for example [Southwark's website](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/473/guide_to_parking/490/pay_by_phone_and_pay_and_display_parking),

&gt; Suspended meters or machines

&gt; Sometimes we have to suspend parking meters and pay and display machines for various reasons. Suspended meters are covered with a bright yellow bag that states that the meter is not in use. Suspended machines will have a notice attached to them. Any vehicle found in a suspended bay will receive a parking fine and may be removed.

Why would it? The point of banning the Nazi flag is to prevent the spread of specific Nazi propaganda, not to prevent all political discussion that some people find distasteful. THAT would be real censorship.

Why exactly was this man wearing the flag, and making his daughter hold one, if he was not a supporter of ISIS?

At least with modern equity release agreement the youngest party has to be a minimum of either 55 or 60 (depending on type). It seems unlikely that both mom &amp; aunt would have been 55+ when the agreement was taken out ~15 years ago although this isn't impossible, especially if Gran is 90+.

* **Most likley:** Gran was aware of the agreement initially and signed off on it but is either not aware of the current balance, or doesn't care much because it only affects her estate and she can't be kicked out.

* **Least likely:** Mum &amp; Aunt own the house (presumably the property being gifted to them sometime prior to the arrangement), were both 55+ when the agreement was taken out (unless rules have changed) and took out the deal themselves. This plan would be under your mum &amp; aunts lifetime but at the very least Gran would probably have signed a form acknowledging the equity release plan.

Either way it does not seem likely Gran is getting kicked out.

As the night goes on I catch a glimpse of Studge, me and my mates wave, he comes over and says hi, we shake hands, I'm really drunk so I say to him, ""I gotta feeling bro, a good feeling about this season, you're gonna score a shit tonne of goals, we're gonna win the league!"" he smiled and said he hoped so, he asked if I wanted a photo, didn't have my phone with me (I had a shit phone at the time), so I said thanks for meeting him and waddled off back to chill with my mates. As the night goes on I get too drunk to function and go home at about 5am, my mate who is a scum supporter, waited till the end of the night and got a picture with studge just to annoy me -_-

I think eventually there will be a big backlash against this from those in the Protestant community that are more socially left leaning and some yet unknown progressive Unionist party will make big gains when it happens.

If they strengthen as we expect it will be much more difficult, but all we can focus on in the league is winning our matches. As was mentioned on another thread, you don't win titles or achieve your objectives on a knockout basis; we could lose every single match to our rivals and still beat them to 3rd/4th. We'll do it by making sure we don't drop points to teams that we should beat.

Either way though, if they do strengthen, I think we have a very good chance in the cup competitions. Our depth of squad is substantially better than previous years, and we can afford to field much more competitive teams in every round.

I went to Liverpool to see us against Zenit in 2013 (I live in London). Before the game my family reserved a table at a pretty fancy restaurant near the city centre (it had London Carriages in its name.)

When we were walking to the restaurant a coach with blacked out windows parked right next to the restaurant but noone got out for a while. When we got inside and were asking for our reservation me and my brother noticed that Zaf Iqbal got out of the bus, and then followed by Jordon Henderson! It was the team coach and I was in disbelief so I ran outside and got a glimpse of Allen, Coates, Enrique and some others. I got a picture with Suarez and got Reina's autograph. 

Turns out that they had gone for a pre-match meal in a hotel next door. It got better because while we were eating Gerrard came in and sat at the table next to us for an interview with some journalist, so I managed to get a picture with him as well.

But as the article points out:

&gt;*A recent report from the Fabian society said that 80% of the additional votes Labour will need to win in 2020 must come from those who voted Tory in 2015.*

What you're suggesting amounts to a mathematical impossibility. And, I'm sorry but as to this:

&gt;If you want to abandon working class support, Green/Plaid/SNP voters in marginal seats, the support of worker cooperatives and unions which created the Labour movement, the support of Green/Red Labour voters, the support of Lazy Labour voters, the support of Scotland, youth support and the support of the North, Liz Kendall is ideal.

There is very little reason to believe any of it. Even if there was, those groups are so disparate that it'd be something of an achievement to alienate *all* of them. Among the general public, Liz Kendall, almost unknown a couple of months ago, was seen as second most likely to win over non-Labour voters after the first hustings.

I, for one, am an active trade unionist and co-operator, and I'm strongly considering Liz as a second or even first preference.

One final thing: The progressive majority is a myth. More people voted for right-wing parties than for left-wing parties in 2015, in an election where the Tories increased their share of the vote (this is true if you don't count Lib Dems as 'right wing' and overwhelmingly true if you do).

There are no references to 65daysofstatic, they are not synomynous with ""banging the drum"", they are not headline billed (so to speak) it's just numerical/alpha order. 

Anyone reading the list and all people involved with the press release probably couldn't pick out 65daysofstatic from any of the other acts on the list.

IMO scale right back on that: your skin won't be getting so dirty you need to use more than two products at night and one (micellar water or gentle toner) in the morning since skin does not get dirty while we sleep.

The one product that stands out as 'bad' is the Boots toner which is loaded with alcohol denat - this is drying and irritating (not always visible to the naked eye, can present as oily say). Several here like the Simple Kind to Skin soothing toner which is cheap in Bodycare or on offer at a chemist or supermarket all the time.

We sweat out minerals so at this time of year or when physically active (at least 10,000 steps) our needs can increase substantially. 

Essential fatty acids are used in constructing cell membranes, including the skin, so they lose less water through evaporation (known as TEWL). Oily fish also supplies vitamin D which we cannot make from October to April, nor when using sunscreen. Experts recommend up to four servings a week.

And they gave him *plenty* of opportunities to do just that! But as usual he seemed to think that if he was stubborn enough for long enough everyone would just fall into line. Even when it got really bad, most people spoke about merely deposing him or forcing him to abdicate in favour of another king! He practically *forced* them to execute him!

Every family is different, although we might say that in certain parts of the country traditional family values may be stronger.

Around me I have always seen some families showing great respect to their elders and some less respect. At the moment, I know lots of people with elderly parents who visit them every day. Also elderly  parents who prefer to live independently.

However, one may say that compared to 50 years ago, there is a lot more divorce, partly because it is economically possible in ways that were not true 2 generations ago.

This leads to lots of different or multiple family arrangements.

Some people regard these as a corruption of true family values, others as the evolution of modern society.

Owning property is a big idea in the UK, to do so one has to move out, but equally, as others say, people may live at home longer to save up for buying somewhere.

Moving for work or marrying someone from another part of the country or abroad is a big reason for families being geographically distinct or distant.

Stevie was injured so he didn't take me out onto the pitch, but of course he came and visited me and had my photo with me. Nice guy although very quiet. Kept himself to himself after the match, except when I went to him to get an autograph.

Carragher was captain that day. He was a top class guy. Looked after me, lifted me up to reach the ""This is Anfield"" sign (I was very small). Had a kick about with me on the pitch (and was very good at making my awful passing look like Alonso's). Talked to me all the time. Nicest guy on the team imho.

Grobellar and Rush hosted the pre-match VIP dinner which I was invited to. Grobellar especially made sure I had everything I wanted, got me up on stage to talk about why I love Liverpool and what the score was gonna be. Also he was very funny. 

Rafa Benitez: Another really nice guy. He wasn't around much before the game (understandably). But when I ran off the pitch just before the match began I passed out in the tunnel and he came rushing over to check I was ok and ask if I needed a doctor, then he went back as we kicked off. He turned up in the player's lounge after the match and he had a really long conversation with my parents and me. He was also very funny. He also asked to have me back next week (as I think that win broke up a streak of pretty bad result). He came across as like your favourite uncle. Absolutely love that man. 

Other notables:

Crouch is fucking huge. Also a really nice guy.

Alonso was nice, asked me a few questions.

&gt;

&gt;__Nick Tanner__ (born Bristol 24 May 1965) is a former [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who played [non-league football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-league_football) for [Mangotsfield United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangotsfield_United_F.C.) before playing professionally for [Bristol Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Rovers_F.C.), [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.), [Norwich City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C.) and [Swindon Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C.). He started professional life as a central midfield player at Bristol Rovers before being signed by Liverpool, and was then converted to a central defender.

&gt;Tanner joined Liverpool from [Bristol Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Rovers_F.C.) and had a short spell on loan at Norwich City in 1990 where he made six appearances. He returned to Liverpool and played 59 games for the club scoring one goal against [Everton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.) in 1991 before retiring through a back injury in 1994. Tanner's mother would not watch any of his matches, whether live or on highlights programs, for fear of seeing him receive a yellow card.

&gt;Since retiring, he became manager of [Almondsbury Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almondsbury_Town_F.C.) in November 2003 leaving them two years later to manage [Roman Glass St George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Glass_St_George_F.C.).  Tanner left Roman Glass St George to become chief scout at [Forest Green Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Green_Rovers_F.C.) and in November 2006 he became manager of Wotton Rovers, but quit a year later.  In November 2009 he was appointed manager of [Hellenic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Football_League) side [Winterbourne United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterbourne_United_F.C.).  Tanner quit Winterbourne in August 2011 however after a poor start to their season.

Not evidence of *anything*? ***Anything***? You accuse me of bias yet you insist on the implying that these people essentially *don't even exist*?

I never claimed that *all feminists* are like that, nor that it is a majority. As a supporter of GamerGate, I know what it's like to have your movement slandered due to the existence of a few bad eggs. I'm not trying to do that. If you go back and look at the statement I made (which you laughed at), you'll see:

&gt;There are people out there who tweeted killallmen and were not being entirely facetious.

Am I wrong? Do these people not exist?

Am I wrong to extrapolate (from the fact that Bahar, for example, actually called for real segregation of white men from an event she organised) and assume Bahar Mustafa is one of those people?

Don't get me wrong, I am aware that she's not a murderer, and that she's not going to go out and actually kill white men just because she said she would — although, I do worry sometimes — but the moment you actually call for real segregation, and engage in real discrimination, kinda takes the whole ""it's a joke"" thing off the table. She is almost certainly one of these radical feminists who ""hates"" white men, and she is in a position of power that allows her to enforce those radical ideas, and yet that was not taken away from her. To me, that spells a problem.

&gt;You'd be better off in life if you looked for more things that lead to a ""no"". You only look for things that lead to a ""yes"" (hence your confirmation bias) which resorts in this distorted and unrealistic worldview where you actually believe people want to kill half of the world.

Spare me the lecture, mate. *You're the one* who's putting words in my mouth; seeing things that aren't there; assuming I'm making claims that the evidence doesn't grant. When I said: ""not being entirely facetious"", that's exactly, *precisely* what I meant. I didn't mean: ""they are not being facetious in any way at all and absolutely want to murder half the world."".

They won't ban encryption, they'll just make it illegal to use any for which the government doesn't have a key or backdoor into. The point of this won't be so much to actively and directly enforce it but to criminalise those who avoid it. 

You can already face up to two years in jail if you fail to give up your encryption key if a court orders you to do so. A ""whitelist"" of encryption allows the skipping of this step by making encryption either accessible to them or illegal.

In other words this would make make anyone the government can't spie on automatic criminals. Fun.

Uhm, I wouldn't really say so. The First Doctor certainly didn't at the start of his adventures and even though he softened as he met more companions, I got the impression that he didn't particularly enjoy saving other people, he was more interested in sight-seeing or testing how own intellect against another. 
The Second Doctor, while I got the sense he was hiding something darker, was a generally nice chap, as was the Third Doctor (though it was his job to save people most of the time). 
The Fourth Doctor did some pretty questionable things during his time, most notably shooting a Sontaran with a De-Mat Gun. 
The Fifth Doctor started off as a nice guy, but slowly became noticeably darker, a companion leaving him because of it. He also shot a Cyberman in the chest. 
The Sixth Doctor, well, he was always a little unhinged. Sure, he meant well for his companions, most of the time, but his enemy's seemed to suffer worse. Saving planets and people definitely didn't seem to be something he wanted to do, or if he did it it was to feed his ego (although maybe deep down he did to it out of moral goodness).
And the Seventh Doctor, boy, he certainly didn't always have hearts of gold. Using a companion, who was only a young girl at the time, as a pawn in a very dangerous game, tricking Davros into destroying Skaro, and many others acts that would be questionable of the Doctor. 
The Eighth Doctor, aaah, the Eighth Doctor. Probably the most Doctor Doctor we've had. And yet, he still destroyed Gallifrey (in the books) and refused to take part in the Time War. Now, on the surface that might seem like a good thing but I think that if the Eighth Doctor had joined earlier, before everything brought him down, he might have saved more lives. 
And the War Doctor, well, we know he wasn't much of a Doctor. 
The Ninth Doctor was, yeah, a pretty nice guy. He felt like he was questing to save the universe, and enjoyed doing it too. But even then, he leaves Cassandra for dead and kills the Slitheen Family.
The Tenth Doctor too wasn't all smiles and warmth. Remember, he began to fall down a slippery slope nearing the end of his life, becoming the Time Lord Victorious. Not to mention killing the Leader of the Scyorax (hmm, that was always a tricky one to spell), his 'one warning' to the Krillitaine, punishing the Family of Blood, and killing the Racnoss *children*, yeah, remember there was children down that hole.
And the Eleventh Doctor, phew, he was far from being a saint. He killed Solomon the Trader, lead an army against the a Chapter of the Church, caused the deaths of the vampires in Venice, and most of all he brainwashed the entire population of the Earth to become murders, what a nice thing to do. Everyone that watches the moon landing now becomes a killer, so that's includes all the pacifists and all the children, killing the Silence at any opportunity.
So, I think that the Twelfth Doctor fits in rather well and isn't all that different from his predecessors.

The research you've done so far will no doubt serve you well and put you in good stead for not only your CBT, but throughout your whole bike ""career"". Too many people go all in without really knowing the wood from the trees.

I would wholeheartedly recommend doing a CBT before buying anything at all. Even your gear. Find a CBT centre that a) is good and b) gives you all the gear you require for the day. Go in with an open mind, take it slowly and enjoy yourself. If after the day you feel revved up and want to go out and rag it down a dual carriageway - good! You've got the bike bug. Onto the next step - get a bike!

But if you come away from the day and think ""shit, that was really horrible. I'm not sure anymore.."" then no sweat - it's not the end of the world (or the end of your bike career at all). Take time to reflect, maybe go back for another session - or not. Give it a few weeks/months. No harm, no foul. If you've not bought a bike yet, then you've only lost the CBT fee (at absolute most).

The reason I say do the CBT first is you must feel comfortable and right on a bike. You can't force yourself into it - doing so would be incredibly dangerous for you, and every other road user around it. Don't spend money on gear, a bike without trying it first. That is exactly what a CBT is for.

Baby steps - they add up faster than you think. I remember going in gently-gently with no real intention to get a full bike license and less than a year later I was tearing it down the M4 on an inline-four gas guzzler. Time flies when you're having fun ;)

My impressions: the room was most enthusiastic about both Burnham and Corbyn. Cooper was getting a good response, but with more moderate enthusiasm. Kendall...had a challenging day. 

Burnham really was stonkingly good at orating- passionate, animated, rabble rousing and believable. His message was definitely on the moderate left- he reiterated the policy on railways of letting DOR bid for franchises as a method of gentle nationalisation, spoke passionately for comprehensive schools and against academies/free schools.

Corbyn was getting a lot of applause for his leftwing stuff- anti war, anti austerity, renationalise the railways now, etc. Very likeable speaker- I could listen to him lecture all day. Witty too- the only one to get laughs out of the room, but didn't descend into comedy either. Very impressive.

Cooper had a policy position similar to Burnham on most points. Generally a greater focus on specific ills instead of big picture stuff- child poverty, etc. Bit less convincing as a rabble rousing orator than the others, with a more measured style. Could work for her if she won, but might not get her across the finishing line if hustings are what decide it.

Kendall. Well, no-one can accuse her of trying to work the room. Railway privatisation? She says it was great. Comprehensive schools? We shouldn't think too harshly about Gove's reforms. You get the idea. Was actually heckled on the schools front, and can't blame them- there were murmurs of disbelief when she as the last answerer to that question took a pro-Gove tack. Confident orator, and didn't seem flustered by the fact she was having a hard time, but didn't particularly outshine the others. Andy was still the stand out speaker.

As for the deputies- honestly, they all came across fantastically. I'd be genuinely thrilled for any of them to win it. Watson was as impressive as you'd expect, and Creasey did very well. Bradshaw, Flint and Eagle all surprised me by how much I liked them. Will be tough to figure out a preference order.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"You theoretically CAN get more money on benefits than in full time work. And it is rather easy to refute. 

The people who do get more money on benefits than full time work tend to have over-riding issues. 

Let's take two examples. 

1. A person who holds down a basic job of around 18 grand a year. VS someone who is a stay at home carer for a disabled relative. The amount of money you could theoretically earn for such a carer is more. Why? Cause you are technically doing a job, that is the job of being a carer. So it's worth paying you money to keep you on that ""job"". If you had to get another carer in full time it would just be exactly the same. And live in carers who are family tend to be worked more than a full time job!

2. Let's take someone with a large family. I don't know. They have 3 kids. You may get more benefits than a single person working because you have more mouths to feed. 

Now the difference is that in both cases the person with a job has some advantages. Mainly? Freedom. Carer Person may have more cash but they cannot really spend it on themselves. In fact due to their ""care job"" I bet they have higher costs (the same way that I do as a medical professional due to my hours) where they often have to sacrifice for the person they are caring for. Just remember the guy who earns less probably can go catch a movie at the drop of a hat.

But the ISIS flag is literally a message of support for terror and being displayed as intimidation, to me thats on par with publicly burning bibles/korans/Talmuds, which is illegal with incitement to cause violence/hate (correct me if im wrong).

Every club at some stage has had a ""helping hand"" to achieve success:

Arsenal - ask them about Henry Norris, and how they only came about by being created from the wreckage of a club in liquidation - not to mention that they shouldn't have been promoted to the top flight anyway. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_%28businessman%29

Liverpool - ask them if they can explain how from the sixties on they were supported by the cash from the Moores business empire (football pools/betting) that enabled them to pay record transfer fees such as the £440,000 for Kenny Dalglish from Celtic,  or the near record fees for Graham Souness and Alan Kennedy, or the big money paid to bring in their legends such as Hanson, Toshack, Hughes and Neal - they were not youth products.

Manchester United - prior to the big youth influx of the ""golden era"", it took an £8m spree to bring in players like Ince, Pallister and Phelan.
Success on the field enabled the club to go public and receive a huge (for the time) cash injection, which together with the increased commercial activity and new TV money, enabled them to spend big to go with the home grown players - Roy Keane in '93 was £3.75m, Andy Cole was £6m - they could argue that this was ""self funded"" but the original burst of cash that pulled them away from the pack came from outside the club - the private investors.

The only difference is that for Man City, Blackburn and ourselves the help has come in a time of more knowledge/transparency in football financing, and is more recent.

&gt;

&gt;__Sir Henry George Norris__ (23 July 1865 – 30 July 1934 ) was an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [businessman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businessman), [politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician) and [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) club director, most famous for his [chairmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman) of both [Fulham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.) and [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.). He is particularly notorious for his alleged role in Arsenal's promotion to the top flight in 1919, despite them only finishing fifth in the Second Division.

From there he loses the woman he loves, hurts one of his dearest friends and inadvertently gets her family enslaved, finds another Time Lord and a daughter only to have both die in his arms, and then he has to violate the mind of his best friend to save her life. 

This leaves him alone, angry, bitter, and leads to him breaking the laws of time and forcing a woman to commit suicide (again, Harriet Jones) to clean up his mess.

And when faced with the end of his existence, he rages against an unfair universe that has taken everything away from him and given him nothing in return.

Yes, yes they are. 

All you're doing here mate is dismissively waving your hands and saying 'oh yeah that'll get solved' about things that, let's be honest, you haven't got the first clue about. It's not that simple.

&gt;legal framework is not really that big a deal

No, it's a huge deal. It's so much more than 'oh the insurance companies will work it out'. New laws will need to be passed and that takes time, whether fewer laws are required than we've currently got or not.

The NHTSA in the US said two years ago that it would not be allowing driverless cars on the roads in anything other than a testing capacity, and they are still nowhere near deciding what they're going to do.

&gt;Source for that heavy rain and snow? 

Just google it mate, there are literally hundreds of articles about it. The cars are stumped by rain, snow, strong sunlight, and can be easily confused by things like plastic bags, potholes and manholes. It's also not been tested in large multi-storey car parks, and doesn't drive beyond 25mph.

&gt; Basically a surmountable problem by using many types of sensory input (visual, laser, GPS, other cars data etc)

Yes, but it still takes time, which is my point. 

They've been trying to get over the rain thing for about three years already, and are very quiet about it.

&gt;I am sure it will outperform humans anyway who already perform poorly in bad weather.

Yes, when it's finally working. Currently that's irrelevant because Google's technology simply does not work in heavy rain.",null,0,null,1436191677,null,0,false,0,cstswe3,null,t3_3ca5pc,null,t1_cstswe3,null,t1_cstsdn3,null,null,null,1437628744,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's about protecting the weak - and we can't do that out of govt. 

Your hero Tony Benn really trashed the Labour party with his intransigence. He fought Michael Foot, he fought Kinnock, he insisted on the maximum publicity for his batshit crazy ideas to give the public the idea Lab was quite mad and dangerous.

Result: 18 years of Conservative govt. If you think the current govt is bad, it's actually a pussycat compared to Thatcher's govt. Millions lost their jobs. Millions lost their homes, interest rates went to 15%.

And *Tony Benn didn't effing care*.  He was egotistical. What mattered to him was pursuing his ideas at all costs. And if that made Labour unelectable and meant that loads of vulnerable people got hurt, that was a price worth paying. People losing their jobs, people dying on NHS waiting lists, because Labour couldn't get elected, were a price worth paying for sticking to ideological purity.

The man was an egotistical monster.

Blair on the other hand actually managed to do a lot of good. Yeah, he talked right, but he acted left. NHS waiting lists fell to just six weeks by the end of the Labour govt (they've risen again now).

Politics isn't a game though the media portrays it as such. People actually died waiting for operations because Benn's intransigence made Labour unelectable.

Eyesight, unlike drinking, affects you over a long period of time, so I don't think personal responsibility is going to work very well in the majority of cases.

I didn't notice I was going short sighted for about a year as I just constantly adjusted to it. Only when I randomly had a check up did I find out I needed glasses to drive. Luckily I didn't have a car at that point but I would have been driving if I had.

null,false,hotcod,null,null,null,"&gt;It breaks the internet because suddenly if you want to use something as benign as SSH you need a special version with the backdoor included.

But up until there's a problem with that version things would still work. Simply banning encryption as some people seem to think is the plan would require us shutting down modern life. 

Point simply is that is whatever the government's actual plan it's not going to be as bad as that and I don't want to see them ""backing down"" into something that might seem more reasonable to most people.  

&gt;As for SSH keys being shared with the government, I spent last week trying to setup FreeBSD on a non-standard bit of hardware, during which time I generated and discarded multiple ssh keys. How does the government get these keys from me? And what is stopping me from not giving them to the government?

Off the top of my head? You hand them over or at least be required to register the deployment and be legally required to hand over the key if asked? Maybe it'll even just be the latter in most cases, cut out the need for a court order as is currently the case. 

Any of which you can not do, just like you can not do a lot of things you are legally required of you but at that point you'd be running the server illegally. You happy to take that risk? I know any company I work for wouldn't. Threats of random audits would be more than enough to ensure compliance. I mean there's no reason we *have* to be running legitimate copies of Microsoft's software deployed in agreement, it did however mean we didn't sink the company when their auditors came knocking.

Again my point is that I think the government is looking to criminalizes anyone they can't spy on rather than simply ban encryption all together.However they do it will be a nightmare but what it won't be is completely unworkable, there would be no reason to worry if it was.

Ah right, so they'd vanish if we got rid of the monarchy? And there was me thinking the Palace of Versailles was still a popular tourist attraction in France.

&gt; The existence of a monarchy does not inherently impede you from becoming wealthy and building yourself a palace...

That's not what I meant at all. In America you are told that you can be anything. Try hard enough son and one day you could become the president!

If they are just rich people why does David Cameron meet one of them roughly once a week?

Personally - I'm of the view that a few months on a CBT will not only make you a safer, more competent rider but will save you money when it comes to the A2 training. As long as you are strict with yourself and don't let yourself develop bad habits, you will be able to take that road experience directly into your A2 training. 

Learn the highway code and get your theory test out of the way early, watch some videos about good riding practice on YouTube (Roadcraft Nottingham!).

Make mistakes (not lethal ones) and learn from them. Cut cars up, overtake badly, cock up an overtake..and vow never to do it again. It's scary - you're so vulnerable on a bike - so you cannot afford for a cock up to go south (and they can go south very *very* quickly). Being on a CBT gives you that experience before you spend any real money on an A2 license, and that experience can really save you when it comes to Mod1/Mod2. 

Ask questions! Lots of the guys (and girls) here will help you with queries. Research yourself, come to your own conclusion and if you still query it then don't be afraid to ask. Lots and lots of good material here, not only on ""what bike to get"" or ""tips for mod1/mod2"" but more detailed, everyday riding tips. Lots of it can save your bacon (and lots of it should be taken with a pinch of salt).

Being on a 125 for a while gives you an appreciation of smaller bikes as well and how to properly allow for it. Being on a smaller bike is (arguably) more dangerous, but you can do lots to allow for that. Those skills you can take directly to an A2 bike. At the end of the day, the more ""hours in the saddle"" you amount and the more experienced you will be. Prior to your full license that can be really useful learning material. Use that time wisely - enjoy riding, but enjoy riding *well*. That then, in my view anyway, will serve you well when it comes to doing it with an examiner.

Me myself - I rode my YBR125 40 miles a day for 8 months before even starting A2 training. I am without a doubt that if I hadn't had that YBR I wouldn't have spent what I did on my A2 license (which was quite low, judging by what I see quoted here).",null,0,null,1436193087,null,0,false,0,csttlrg,null,t3_3ca49z,null,t1_csttlrg,null,t1_cstscz4,null,null,null,1437629281,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

Do try and avoid being facetious. The Royal family is responsible for organising maintenance, restorations, modernisation, etc for dozens of estates all over the country. As I've said, several times, the majority of the money given to the House of Windsor is spent in exactly the same way the Branch of the French government tasked with maintaining the Palace of Versailles spends their Euros.

The Royal family is a glorified national trust. They continue to exist in such a glorified position because their ancestors, and predecessor dynasties ran the country for well over a thousand years and in the case of Victoria, lead Britain in founding the largest Empire in human history.

&gt;In America you are told that you can be anything

The Americans are delusional. The American dream has been a joke for centuries. You cannot be whatever you want to be, if you're lucky you might. Chances are life will fuck you sideways.

Anyone can be the Prime Minister, the guy who does all the running the country business. A monarch is not analogous to a president.

Besides, My becoming King is just as likely as becoming a Billionaire. I just need to fuck the right people, figuratively and literally, marry into the right family, and top it off with a few discreet assassinations. Same process really.

&gt;If they're just rich people why do we give them money? I believe the queen was trying to tap a few extra million this past year. 

1. The government rents a lot of land and property from them. They are the legal owners of a lot of fancy official buildings in London. The Monarchy is responsible for construction of the building our government does it's business in.

2. They need money to maintain all those fancy tourist traps. It saves having to set up a government department, when you can just let the people who own the houses anyways do it.

&gt;If they are just rich people why does David Cameron meet one of them roughly once a week? 

Ceremony. Why does Barack Obama have to swear upon a poor translation of a middle eastern bronze age religious text?

People like pomp and ceremony. We've had a monarchy for over a thousand years, the infrastructure for that style of pomp is already there.

&gt;If they are just rich people why do they get special access to the government of the day?

Which new laws will we need exactly? Far less than what is required for human drivers I am sure and we've managed that ok.

&gt; The NHTSA in the US said two years ago that it would not be allowing driverless cars on the roads in anything other than a testing capacity, and they are still nowhere near deciding what they're going to do.

Two years ago, you don't have a clue what the current state of play is. Besides which, they wouldn't allow testing if they didn't think it was going to happen.

&gt;Just google it mate, there are literally hundreds of articles about it. The cars are stumped by rain, snow, strong sunlight, and can be easily confused by things like plastic bags, potholes and manholes. It's also not been tested in large multi-storey car parks, and doesn't drive beyond 25mph.

Did you actually watch that video fully? The car avoided a bird that flew in front of it and avoided hazards that human driven cars didn't (the cyclist crossing the road).

&gt; Yes, but it still takes time, which is my point.

I never said it wouldn't take time but I think you are overestimating how long it will be before this is a reality. 3 million hours a day they log in simulators, every car will have access to every other cars experienses and they will only get better with time.

&gt; Yes, when it's finally working. Currently that's irrelevant because Google's technology simply does not work in heavy rain.

It's just something that needs some work, it will be overcome eventually. The other thing to bear in mind is that it doesn't need to be perfect, only better than humans (average 1 accident per 100k miles).

Also the rain thing I understand is because they aren't testing in rain due to safety concerns (I presume they don't want to be sued if something does go wrong so they are rightly very cautious), that doesn't mean it doesn't work at all in the rain. It's still in testing as you say and there's more than just google on the case.

Technically it would work, but the reality is that unless the non-compliant versions were blocked along with VPN traffic from UK networks they couldn't stop people from using them. And it's unlikely that developers, especially FOSS devs, are going to maintain parallel versions for the UK specifically.

&gt; Any of which you can not do, just like you can not do a lot of things you are legally required of you but at that point you'd be running the server illegally. You happy to take that risk? I know any company I work for wouldn't. Threats of random audits would be more than enough to ensure compliance. I mean there's no reason we have to be running legitimate copies of Microsoft's software deployed in agreement, it did however mean we didn't sink the company when their auditors came knocking.

It's not a company thing though, it's just a little lower power box I'm using to log SNMP data from some my router (also using encryption), and some NAS servers (also encrypted). Are peoples homes going to be audited as well? And are private firms going to be happy with a) encryption audits and b) having to store all their encryption keys with the government?

Yep think I've got that.

&gt;On a personal level religion isn't a bad thing, I couldn't care less what anyone's religious beliefs are. It's when religious beliefs start effecting other people that's when I take issue.

But your beliefs that ""There should be no religion in the UK"" is going to effect other peoples beliefs, hypocritical.

&gt;Things like religion in school. It shouldn't even be mentioned in school.

History is going to interesting to teach.

&gt;The drawing of mohammed it should never have became a political debate. People can draw it if they want and nobody can stop them. End of discussion.

No law against drawing old Mo. 

&gt;Same with marriage any two people of consenting age should be able to get married. End of discussion.

Again something else that is legal. These religious lot are really pressing us.

&gt;Baby boys getting circumsised without any medical need. Should it be allowed? No

Again in your opinion. Cultural issue too, very popular in the USA for non religious reasons.

&gt;The list goes on for miles. Do away with religion and 99% of the problems this world faces go too.

Really think your over egging it there. 

So out of that list of things that don't really have a great deal to do with my life, I have to go back to my original assertion on what is now becoming a rather boring conversation. I would rather live in in a country with freedom of speech and religion. Not expecting you to agree. Think I'll leave it at that. God bless.

If you think managers will always pick their best XI in terms of raw capability, you would be absolutely wrong.

Some for valid reasons (poor attitude/Capoue), some for seemingly random ones (A poor shot on goal against Burnley I guess????/Paulinho).

People are annoyed that we're losing capable players such as Paulinho/Capoue who are absolutley more capable than XI players such as Mason.

In Capoue's case, he was a starter for us at the beginning of the season and had some exceptional games. Whilst being the best DM in the squad, it's clear attitude problems have prevented his potential from being realised, which is why people have described his time with Tottenham as a 'shame'.

With Paulinho's, despite being more productive than every other single CM in the team despite having only played a fraction of the games, he wasn't given a string of games and hence why people see him being sold as a 'shame'.

We did and I'm with you in terms of upgrading Mason's position with someone who is better at helping to reinforce our defense. 

The problem extends to how our shape changes as we go forward: not only do the FBs charge forward all the way down the line, but the CBs will often go wider with the assumption that the CMs are going to fill the middle of the park incase the attack goes awry.

That's why you saw our CBs often out of position because (with Fazio) they were too slow to recover into position without proper CDMs to fill the gap or (with Dier) they had trouble determining the right position to take with just two defenders to help Lloris.

I have no more clue than you. The difference is that I'm being conservative whereas you're writing things off as easy that you have no clue about and which have been highlighted as major hurdles by numerous experts including MIT researchers.

&gt;you think google would spend millions on this and say publicly 'we are confident this will work' if they thought that was a problem?

Where have I said this won't work? It's about time, not feasibility.

&gt;Two years ago, you don't have a clue what the current state of play is. Besides which, they wouldn't allow testing if they didn't think it was going to happen.

Again, I've never fucking said it won't happen.

&gt;Did you actually watch that video fully? 

Yep, watched all 15 mins.

&gt;The car avoided a bird that flew in front of it

Yes, yes it did. The problem is that it cannot recognise what is in front of it and will stop for it. A plastic bag in the road will cause the car to stop. This is the issue. And it's not speculation - Urmson has said it himself.

&gt;I never said it wouldn't take time but I think you are overestimating how long it will be before this is a reality. 3 million hours a day they log in simulators, every car will have access to every other cars experienses and they will only get better with time.

Yep, this is all fine, but the automotive world moves slowly. 

&gt;It's just something that needs some work, it will be overcome eventually. The other thing to bear in mind is that it doesn't need to be perfect, only better than humans (average 1 accident per 100k miles).

Again, I know, but it's going to take a long time. They were hoping to have this nailed ages ago.

&gt;Also the rain thing I understand is because they aren't testing in rain due to safety concerns (I presume they don't want to be sued if something does go wrong so they are rightly very cautious), that doesn't mean it doesn't work at all in the rain.

Well, I dunno. Urmson himself has said the tech does not work yet in the rain. He said that a year ago and we've still seen nothing.

And it's unlikely that developers, especially FOSS devs, are going to maintain parallel versions for the UK specifically.

Totally agree, which is largely why this approach will be a cluster fuck but it's a cluster fuck I can see the government actually causing. 

&gt;It's not a company thing though, it's just a little lower power box I'm using to log SNMP data from some my router (also using encryption), and some NAS servers (also encrypted). Are peoples homes going to be audited as well? 

My main point is that there's value to the government in criminalising you even if the law is systematically unenforceable. The very simplest form of this would would be to expand the existing laws and remove the need for the court order when asking for a key. Add in the need to register and anyone who they find using encryption who's not on the list would start acting as handy short cut to probable cause for all kinds of fun surveillance.

&gt;  And are private firms going to be happy with a) encryption audits and b) having to store all their encryption keys with the government?

No, of course not, no one should be happy about any of this. Doesn't mean it won't happen or people and companies won't comply.

I would always advise anyone knew to riding to get out in those conditions and do it.

Sadly you were not capable of reading that far and so the followup content I posted was in vain.

You don't need to feel insulted and in return insult me just because I don't agree with you. As far as I'm aware he didn't fall out with AVB or Sherwood, the reason he was dropped by them was because his bad performances in games and also in training (I guess), both before and after his injury. It's a myth that he was stellar before his injury, he had perhaps two really good games for us while the rest were average to straight up bad.

&gt;If you think managers will always pick their best XI in terms of raw capability, you would be absolutely wrong. There are lots of factors as to why capable players will be sold at the expense of inferior ones. Some for valid reasons (poor attitude/Capoue), some for seemingly random ones (A poor shot on goal against Burnley I guess????/Paulinho).

If you think Paulinho was sold because of one shot off target then there is really no discussion of value I can have with you because that is just ridiculous. Paulinho obviously didn't suit the style of football Pochettino wanted. He was too slow and not good enough at defending for playing as one of the CMs in our team.

&gt;In Capoue's case, he was a starter for us at the beginning of the season and had some exceptional games. Whilst being the best DM in the squad, it's clear attitude problems have prevented his potential from being realised, which is why people have described his time with Tottenham as a 'shame'.

Being the best DM in our squad isn't really saying much since he was the only one except an injured Sandro. His passing was so terrible, I still have nightmares about him playing against United, he had like 50-55% pass completion. He was constantly falling asleep not tracking runners and he was giving fouls away left right and center.

The reason Mason started over Paulinho and Capoue was simply because he is better suited for the style of football we are playing. So in the context of the football we are trying to play Mason is a more capable player. There is no fucking point in keeping players that might be good at a style of football we are not trying to play.

Pochettino doesn't have an irrational preference for Mason, he has an extremely rational preference for players that suits his style of football.",null,0,null,1436196931,null,0,false,0,cstvps6,null,t3_3caggx,null,t1_cstvps6,null,t1_cstuiov,null,null,null,1437630962,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

This is criminal case law rather than civil, but it still fits quite nicely with your scenario as it shows how the producer of a device can be liable for how its operators use it - the device was not illegal to sell or to own, merely to use without a license, but the producers were still found liable for its use.

I can't find it currently and that's worrying because it means the press is acting to make this seem far worse than it is which will make people more open to what seems the more likely goal.

No, they haven't said any such thing.  There hasn't even been anything from random ""former home secretaries"" which is how controversial ideas are usually flagpoled.

Why the bloggers are getting so pre-emptively het-up I have no idea, but there does seem to be a lot of water being muddied by people who really should be trying to clarify things.

&gt; They won't ban encryption, they'll just make it illegal to use any for which the government doesn't have a key or backdoor into. The point of this won't be so much to actively and directly enforce it but to criminalise those who avoid it.

The only thing even close to a proposal we have at the moment is the draft text of the previous bill that was introduced and withdrawn in 2012.  So I'm presuming this is going to be the basis of any new law.  Of course that was three years ago, and wholesale paranoia has got worse since, so they could add any crap to it.

But the basis of that draft law was to put a lot of cost and responsibility on the ISPs and any other ""communication provider"" rather than individuals.  And, if anything I expect this to be the basis of any new law.  Why?  Because the name-of-the-game is mass surveillance, the RIPA Act gives them enough powers to go after any non-complying individuals; what they want is access to communications at core.  They want to know if A is talking to B, etc.

They might want to go the full dragnet and have keys for *everything*, but this would require a massive central infrastructure to setup, which they might be less keen on.  And they'd have a much harder sell for the law - e.g. if I set up a server, do I need to give SSH keys that are only used to maintenance access to the government?  All these would be a goldmine for a control freak government, but it it's secondary to their goal, which is to have a gigantic map of people, online identities and relationships.

&gt; Backdooring however just opens that door, we can carry on with things as they are... right up until something goes wrong.

Indeed, Internet security is paper-thin at the best of times.  Giving the likes of Sky, BT and the useless mobile networks not only the power, but the legal obligation to MITM certain services (which, I bet, *will* be part of the bill), can only end badly.

Back to the point though all the things you mentioned he did do to save someone (even if it was only himself). Yes he often puts others at risk when he does so but that either because 1: there's no other option or 2: (and I admit this happens more often) he is arrogant to a fault. Using someone as a pawn in a dangerous game doesn't seem that bad if you know you have a winning strategy and The Doctor usually does win as evidenced by the fact he's still around.

Ultimately I agree more with you than with op BUT I do think op has a point. In Into The Dalek lying to the soldier to save everyone else even though he couldn't save him was detached.

null,false,BillyShankly,null,null,null,"I've met loads of current (and ex) Reds over the years. The best/worst was when I met Robbie Fowler at a garden centre on the Wirral. 

It was around 1995. Fowler was in his prime, a God (literally The God) and I was a callow and uncommunicative teenager. I'd been dragged to the garden centre by my parents, and to my abject horror, my mum's dog 'Mason' (a large male Samoyed) violently humped Robbie Fowler's left leg. Fowler was shocked by the speed and vigor of the assault and tried to firmly shake the dog off, but Mason was having none of it; he just clung on and humped faster and more aggressively. It seemed to last for an eternity - I was f*cking mortified.

In the end, we finally separated Mason genitals from Robbie Fowler's leg and continued about our business at the garden centre. Mason was happy as could be, trotting along with his still-unsheathed bright pink penis on display, looking for the next place he could put it. My mum was happy enough too. She dismissed the moment in a heartbeat -oblivious to the world of football as ever- she didn't even know who Fowler was. Everyone was happy except me! I felt like the whole Universe had conspired against me to create the Ultimate Moment of Embarrassment.

If I ever see him again, I'll mention it: ""Hey remember me? My dog almost ejaculated on your thigh in 1995.""

For those of you that don't know what Samoyeds look like, they're large (waist-high) and white and *very* fluffy. So you can imagine how ridiculous the porn scene with Robbie and Mason looked. 

Here's a pic of a Samoyed - to make the mental image even more vivid:

&gt;**But the Tories are wrong to force free schools and academies on local communities, and they have completely failed to ensure there is proper accountability in the system.**

&gt;This must change. **There must be fair funding per pupil, free schools must take their proper share of children with special educational needs, and they must have a comprehensive intake and curriculum**. Importantly, **decisions about where new schools are built should prioritise areas where the shortage of places is greatest.**

&gt;We know that **what really makes a difference in education is great heads and great teachers, schools working in partnership with one another, a curriculum that inspires kids and prepares them for the modern world, and ensuring parents are properly engaged.** It is these issues – not the Tories ideological obsession with school structures – that will be my priority as Labour’s next leader and Prime Minister.

And the point is people who don't get an exceptional education and/or have to worry about money are at an automatic disadvantage to a person of comparable intelligence, work ethic, etc from the more privileged parts of society.

There is nothing that makes those people more suitable to run the country except the fact they were born into privilege. The ""older"" the money they come from the more likely they diid nothing to deserve it except exploit others. There is nothing innately better about them, they aren't our superiors, they don't have a divine right, they aren't genetically superior, they are just people. And of course they have no interest, or perhaps no understanding, of why it would be better to give everyone the closest we can to equality of oppourtuinity (not equality of outcome before you start on that).

The major flaw in your logic is this 

&gt;Anyone who has had an exceptional education is not going to be an average person.

The exceptional education is not awarded based off merit in most cases.

&gt;and a highly successful career 

This is a better indicator but even if we ignore nepotism, classism, etc then we still have to consider that the people who arbitrarily got a better education are much more likely to achieve a succesful career. And whereas someone with a priviliged background might have to be average and hard working, someone without those advantages will have to work much harder to achieve the same level of success. 

&gt;Which is good, because I don't want average people running the country.

That is what you get when our society and political system doesn't really allow for true meritocracy. If that is truely what you want then I strongly suggest you look more closely at how meritocracy can be achieved.

You might also find it interesting to read Robert Michel's *Political Parties*. I don't agree with all his political beliefs but I think he makes some strong arguments in this book. I don't agree with his bleak verdict on democracy but I definitely believe the problems he identifies are real and things we must struggle against. 

I tried to find the fulltext free online but my google skills failed me so the wiki page will have to do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy

The same goes for Max Weber who arguably provided the basis for Michel's ideas. I don't agree with all his solutions and verdicts but I agree on most of the problems he identifies.

Unless I've misunderstood you and you are saying an oligarchy is good? But that can't be the case because you definitely seem to want meritocracy (""I don't want average people running the country"") and oligarchy is the antithesis of meritocracy.

null,false,superradwalkman,flair6,,null,"&gt;More of our clean sheets came through Paulinho starts than Mason, not to mention that Mason was actually horrible defensively. (Southampton anyone?)
Capoue had the best pass rate in the team and completed the most successful long balls.

Are you really this dishonest when you argue? Paulinho started 3 games, Mason started 29. That is obviously not enough to draw any conclusions, fucking ridiculous.

Capoue had 87% pass accuarcy in his 12 apps last season and that is a good number but on par with the rest of our central midfielders. Bentaleb had 87% (26 apps), Mason had 84% (31 apps), Stambouli had 84% and Dembélé had 89% (26 apps), Capoue averages 20m/pass, Mason 18m/pass. So sure, he is marginally better at passing the ball than Mason but not that much better and we still have to take in to consideration that Mason played much more games, more minutes per game and in harder games.

When it comes to duels won Mason wins 49% of his overall duels, Capoue won 42% of his. Capoue won 42% of his tackles, Mason won 45% of his. Capoue caused 33 fouls in his 12 apps, Mason caused 64 in his 31 apps. The only defensive duel stat where Capoue beats Mason is headers, and that is obvious since Capoue is a much larger man, Capue 67% succesfull Mason 40%. It actually looks like Mason is a better defender if you look at the stats, oops I guess?

null,false,Tiothae,null,null,null,"&gt; I think we'd probably agree that insofar as your gender dysphoria taken in isolation, it's better that your care is handled by a specialist clinic.

I agree entirely, the issue isn't the necessity of the clinic, the issue is the funding that the clinic receives, in my opinion. In relation to an increase of patients, I don't believe the existing clinics have been given the resources to deal with it. I think the general course of care for patients with gender dysphoria is pretty fantastic in the UK, the main weak point is the time between referral from GP to starting at the clinic.

&gt;It's a relatively uncommon situation compared to say depression or schizophrenia, and so the number of experienced clinicians is likewise smaller.

I realise that you don't intend it, but this does give off a vibe of ""People with uncommon conditions should expect to be treated as second class patients"". One could also argue that because it's a less common condition, it would be easier to target the weak points in care pathways than it would be for more common conditions.

&gt;Once you reach the end of that waiting list you'll begin a course of assessment and treatment, so hopefully it'll be one long wait and then some good progress.

Absolutely, I have no doubt in the quality of care that the clinics can provide.

&gt;Secondly, don't forget that if you do become depressed or have other concerns, your GP can still assist or refer to other services in the meantime. I understand that you want to get things rolling right away, but you're not being hung out completely to dry.

In a way, I'm fortunate in this respect. My dysphoria doesn't lead me to self-harm in the same way that it does to others. I put this partly down to my age (I'm older than quite a few people seeking care for it currently, so I'm more *used to* dealing with it) and having come to my own methods of dealing with those feelings. Some people are not so lucky.

&gt;I hope everything goes well!

I don't think it's that Clara wasn't retroactively placed into every adventure, because I think I showed that it was the case.

The big difference between Clara and the GI is that Clara *successfully* saved The Doctor countless times, while the GI *failed* to defeat The Doctor countless times. Failing repeatedly can hardly be considered Mary Sue-ish.

The only villain thing I can think of that could come close would be it being revealed that a single entity was directly responsible for every villain in the series. Was behind the Daleks and Davros and The Master and the Cybermen, etc. Because that's compatible with what we've actually seen. We saw The Doctor's adventures and we know he wasn't defeated in all of them.

In Asylum, rather than her being so brilliant that the Daleks turn her into a Dalek, instead have her just be a normal human. A human who was lured into the depths of the asylum by an insane, and seemingly friendly Dalek.

This Dalek is so insane that it hates all of Dalek-kind, itself most of all. When Clara gets to it, it kills her by scanning her brain, same way the Daleks did it in the season two finale. It then recreates Clara's mind within itself, resulting it beliving that he really is Clara.

Now Clara isn't super special, she's just convenient. The discussion of whether or not she really is Clara gains more depth. If she thinks like Clara and has her memories, isn't it like her mind just got transferred?

Rather than change the memories of every Dalek, Clara-Dalek helps The Doctor fake his own death. The Daleks think their greatest enemy is exterminated, so are no longer driven by their feet, but it doesn't require Clara-Dalek doing anything particularly special.

Have Victorian Clara just one of many people The Doctor has helped since losing Amy, rather than be the only person who snaps him out of his funk. Perhaps she's the first since Amy he's considered making a proper companion, but her death happens. Story stays the same, but she's not being made super special.

Rather than the leaf seemingly fix the problem by itself, instead have her rally the aliens and convince them to give up more items. Their items, along with The Doctor's memories, along with the leaf, is enough. Clara saves the day, but by doing something meaningful rather than by waxing poetical about ""infinite possibilities.""

If things had been differently, I probably wouldn't have felt bad about the inserted into every adventure thing, but they weren't, so it just felt like yet another instance of a string of ""Clara is special"" moments.

Her going back to child Doctor is just the final moment so far and, to be honest, I can't think of a way to make it acceptable to me.",null,0,null,1436199861,null,0,false,0,cstxgti,null,t3_3c78u5,null,t1_cstxgti,null,t1_cstscwk,null,null,null,1437632023,null,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0,null

What? I don't follow. I think you miss my point. It applies to two intelligent people as well. The one who goes to private school will find it easier to get into a top university right? The person who is just as intelligent but with out all the advantages would have to work hard to achieve the same? 

My point applies to both all levels of intelligence, dillidence, etc so long as you comapre like for like. 

&gt;You need to score well at A-level in order to get into Oxford.

Well yeah but are you seriously saying private school and state schools in wealthy areas don't give you an advantage? Even if the education quality is the same (which it obviously isn't), the range of courses and extra-curricular activities alone is highly beneficial. 

&gt;Only 33% of MPs have had a private education. 

When such schools only educate about 7% of the population that doesn't do your argument any favours. That is nearly 5 times what we could consider representative. 

&gt;Talking about the oligarchy thing, I don't know what you're getting at. Oligarchy is rule by the few, how is what I am saying related to that? (Not combative, genuinely not following.)

You are saying you want the best people for the job to run the country right? That is called meritocracy, where people achieve their position in government on merit alone.

I am saying that I believe our current system has some elements of meritocracy but some of the inequality in the system means an oligarchy emerges. An oligarchy is the rule by the few but it is normally used to describe a specific type of rule (for example a few who are from a certain class, background, school, etc). Typically also to describe a group who don't do anything to expand the pool of potential rulers. 

Oligarchy is normally considered to be undemocratic and to not employ true meritocracy. Democracy and meritocracy in their truest sense mean giving equal value and oppourtunity to anyone. Our curreny system means that there is a bias for selection of people from a certain class and background that isn't based on their true personal merit. 

Michel's book argues that oligarchy always emerges in democracy because democracy requires organisation and organisation always leads to oligarchy (read the book if you want to see the reasoning). I think that is a strong point. Michels ultimately concluded that democracy couldn't work though, and I disagree with him there. I think we have to struggle against the tendency to oligarchy. 

I can see how you might argue it isn't that big a problem or something maybe but it seems impossible to outright deny it. 7% of the population educated at private schools make up 33% of the rulers of the country. And I wonder how it would look if we then took into account the poeple who didn't go to a private school but lived in an affluent area with good schools, sadly can't find a statistic for that. On top of that it isn't like this is a temporary thing, as things stand it doesn't look like their will be a great change to try and provide people from deprived areas with the same chances to better themselves and achieve the same as those more priviliged.

They base all their operations on newspeak, ''fulfilment centre'', ''enjoyment provider'', it's really creepy.

They base all their operations in areas of high poverty as they know they'll get slaves easier. All workers get searched and pass through metal detectors on entering and leaving, you have to go ask for a key to the bathroom where the only source of drinking water is and they make you feel like shit for doing so, seriously bust out a 10hr shift moving boxes and need a drink well fuck you. You have to buy food from their canteen which is really expensive as lunch is only 1/2hr (min required by law) but you can't go off site because you have to get searched which takes longer than 1/2hr if you leave before your shift ends, no where to store your own packed lunch as you are not allowed to bring any private items on site not even a belt.

One of my mates got fired from Amazon for giving a woman first aid, seriously Amazon felt he was a threat because he showed initiative to provide first aid, ''that's not slave material he's showing independent thought, union leader alert, alert, independent thought detected!''.

Working in Amazon in the UK is as close to a concentration camp that this government has so far allowed.

I worked at Amazon part-time as a student, well I said worked... I worked the first week then realised this was a con and complete slavery so got bored and found a way to sign off on unmonitored worked and then I just done power exercises with a loaded shopping cart like I was at the gym for 12hrs &amp; walked around the warehouse window shopping, lasted 3 months till I got caught.

I also got to meet a load of Polish people that I thought seemed far too smart, organised &amp; happy to be ''Amazonians'' (more newspeak) turns out they were a criminal gang and were stealing shit loads from Amazon. I was so happy when they just never turned up one day and Amazon realised what had happened.

It was a really simple scam and one Amazon still has no cure for, you get a slave job at Amazon then you find and order a rare but cheap item from the website say a children's/beginners telescope for £20 then you find a crazy expensive item of similar description ''Astronomer super duper you'll find aliens and shit £50k telescope'' and then you swap the serial numbers round by using a label printer at home so you pick that scope and pass it onto your other gang members for posting or simply let it slide through the system.

&gt; What if it's 1 percent? Or 90 percent? You have no idea.

it really doesnt matter, the way they are cutting the benefits, they are still putting 1% or 10% at a huge risk by making blanket cuts and taking it away from those that need it urgently. its like saying we should be shooting a shotgun when you should be using a sniper if that makes sense, theirs going to be collateral.

&gt;So we shouldn't even try to make it fair?

Of course, but the tories are not going about it in the right way at all, especially given the fact that their was a protest held by disabled people who their policies directly effect and of course they need it.

Now, even if he wants to leave later, he would leave as a much better player, get a nice wage increase once again, which is great for him. For us that would mean getting another world record fee, which should minimize the impact of him leaving, as we could get another world class player.

For Juve, 71mil profit for a player that is only potentionally worth that much, is a great deal. It would be a hard offer to refuse, because they might never get such an offer again later.

To the vast majority of postal workers I talk to, you'd think that the Labour party may as well be dead to them. They really couldn't care less who was running for leadership, to them it makes absolutely no difference. These people gave up on the Labour party a long time ago, and talking to them you get the impression it would take some very strong convincing for them to come back. Consider that Royal Mail's workforce was completely betrayed by Labour over privatization, and it was under Blair that the postal market was opened up to competition in the first place, leading to the dismal state of affairs we have today. Yet ironically our union (the CWU), is still a Labour party affiliate. The new general secretary won the ballot on the promise of ""no more blind loyalty to Labour"". I have yet to encounter a frontline union rep or even a senior rep that hasn't lost all faith in the Labour party. The shared ideology among many posties is that of more militant trade union values. There is a constant feeling of being at war with the management, and a belief that the workforce could effectively run the shopfloor itself (i've actually witnessed this happen, and it worked without a hitch).

The answer however is not 'stop having bonfires'.

Arguably this can even lead to someone who isn't the best candidate getting the job for two reasons. One if the 'poor' candidate is marginally better then the 'posh' candidate might beat him based off the advantages he has rather than personal merit (e.g. someone who studied Latin would be at an advantage when trying to study the classics at Oxbridge).

He's not disciplined enough defensively to be played without someone who will mop up for him. So Lucas would be a great partner for him in the center. 

So for example him and Henderson in a midfield two on paper won't work. Neither of them are particularly defensively disciplined so our defense would be exposed to counter attacks of the opposition. Hendo and Milner are both engine midfielders meaning they cover ridiculous amounts of ground and can help out in both attack and defense, but they're both better going forward. 

If they had a holding player between them in a midfield 3 like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7w71), that would work great. Having Lucas there would protect the defense and allow them to thrive. They could help contribute to defense, but wouldn't be depended on for it. 

Him playing wide plays to his strengths again as his defensive contribution for a wide player is exemplary. There is less demand on a wide player tracking back to defend then asking a player to so centrally. Also playing wide plays to his creative strengths.

I'd expect to see Milner being used both wide and centrally next season as he is capable of doing both. It will probably just depend on injuries, fitness of players, rotation and tactics.

Sadly yes. They are a declared left wing paper and can be relied on to appeal to their audience. That doesn't mean everything they print is wrong but if a story can be spun as 'evil tories' that is exactly what they'll do.

Agreed, unfortunately that's not easy and as things stand any attempt to do it is immediately leapt on as an 'attack on the vulnerable'. How would you do it?

tax avoidance or tax evasion? An important distinction. Also remember Labour were recently in power for 13 years.

null,false,britishchink,eng-hampshire,hampshire,null,"&gt; I think you miss my point

To recap. You said that 'so many come from privileged backgrounds making them unable to relate to the average person'. *That* was your point.

I said that (1) Anyone exceptional enough to perform in government is not going to be average (2) I don't want average people running the country.

You then started talking about people who live on money entombed through generations of their family (and such like). And I said we're not talking about that.

I tried to get the discussion back to politicians because of the original point, that they're separated from us because of their privilege. I stated that (1) Most MPs are *not* privately educated, therefore challenging *your* point about easy life v. hard life: politicians in general don't have the 'easy life' you are describing.

&gt; are you seriously saying private school and state schools in wealthy areas don't give you an advantage? 

No, I accept that it does give you an advantage. But whether or not you were privately educated, getting into Oxford will give you an exceptional education/career (therefore you are not average). 

&gt; That is nearly 5 times what we could consider representative

That's neither here nor there. Since 66% of MPs have not been privately educated, your points are not applicable to the majority of MPs.

And I do believe that we have equality of opportunity. If you want to work hard in school, get experience, graduate and get a good job, *you can do that*. Nobody's stopping you. Equality of opportunity is not the same as discriminating in favour of the disadvantaged.

Edit: An analogy. If you want to run a race, you need to prove that you are capable of competing. You are allowed to enter the race, and it doesn't matter if you practised on a track or on your own street.

Well no point wasting time talking.

Anyone who claims helping the disadvantaged have truely equal opportunity is pointless ""discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged"" obviously has a fundamentally different outlook to me on politics and the role of a government. 

&gt;: An analogy. If you want to run a race, you need to prove that you are capable of competing. You are allowed to enter the race, and it doesn't matter if you practised on a track or on your own street. Just because you haven't practised on a track, or have broken a leg, or have family problems, people aren't going to just let you win the race.

So people who get personal trainers because their family are rich have an equal opportunity to those who don't (not even gonna think about the people right at the bottom where stuff like malnutrition, problems at home, etc become more prevelant)? Just someone who doesn't have a personal trainer or enough money to go to a gym. Are you saying that those two individuals, if of equal natural atheltic prowess, have an equal chance to win the race? HOW IS THAT EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. 

33% of the people leading this country have gone to private school (again ignoring other forms of privilege such as living in an affluent area with good schools). 

I'm not saying give unsuitable people jobs in government. I'm saying that they don't have an equal oppourtuinty when they don't have the same resources and advantages that the upper class to. And that the current government is doing nothing to rectify the situation. 

&gt;And I do believe that we have equality of opportunity. If you want to work hard in school, get experience, graduate and get a good job, you can do that. Nobody's stopping you. Equality of opportunity is not the same as discriminating in favour of the disadvantaged.

If I chop off your leg do you not have the same opporutuinty to win a race as someone who gets both. 

If I let myself be well educated why not giving you the same quality of education then that is not equality is it? 

Equality of outcome would equal forcing a representative distribution of backgrounds for MPs. THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM SAYING.

Equality of opportunity equals giving people the same education, access to services, not having to worry about making money to live, not having to worry about fees, etc. Because all of those things PUT A DISADVANTAGE ON PEOPLE. This is the issue that I am pointing out. None of your points adress this. You are either misunderstanding me or deliberately moving the goalposts. 

I wouldn't mind if every single MP was privately educated if I thought that all state schools gave the same quality of education. If I thought that people from poor families didn't have to consider the cost of higher education whereas a rich family doesn't.

I don't see what is hard to grasp. Nor do I see how anyone could disagree with that? I mean argue whatever you want. Fascism if that is what you believe, whatever. But the claims you are making to prove equality of opportunity are simply nonsensical.

Setting up a team? Okay I'll give Mou that, but that's what I mean by COACH.

Motivating them - not so sure. It's not like Mourinho wins with mediocre players is it? We're talking about a manager who probably has the greatest net spend of all time. Arguably a top 4 finish with the likes of Denilson, Song, Squillaci, Bendtner, Chamakh, Almunia with a core of RVP, Nasri and Cesc (one of whom always took a hit that fucked up the season as Wenger couldn't spend on squad depth), is a better example of motivating players.

Now, let's talk about the Emirates stadium and how Wenger managed the club's finances whilst the Club brought in new revenue streams. Our champions league qualifications every year means we have cash balances earned via pure profits that offset our debt, making our net debt almost negligible. 

To remind you again, we are talking about a 60,000+ seater stadium in the most expensive city in the world, that will bring Arsenal an additional £30m+ of revenue per year. That's an Alexis Sanchez each year.

&gt; someone who isn't the best candidate getting the job

Consider this: Often, the best candidate can be someone who comes from a (wealthy) background of people in the same field. Many of my friends come from ""army families"" (dad, uncle, brother, other uncle all in it) and make fantastic soldiers partly because they were brought up in this tradition. They are more likely to stick with it long-term, and have this wealth of intuition and ""soft skills"" that others wouldn't. 

&gt; Arguably this can even lead to someone who isn't the best candidate getting the job

In theory I agree with you, it is unfair and social mobility, breaking into new fields can occasionally be difficult. But (unfortunately like many ideas from the left of the political spectrum), in practise any solution doesn't quite follow through. Any idea to counter this ends up being ridiculous. 

* We could make it ""harder"" for people who are considered privileged to apply - but how? Who decides who is privileged? What is the threshold? Does this infringe free will? How much harder? 

* Perhaps we could institute quotas - based on what? Are people groups or individuals?

This was actually tried in the Soviet Union and can be currently seen in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Parents been to university? You're not allowed. Parent is an intellectual? You get discriminated against. 

The entirety of the Russian Intelligentsia ended up emigrating to the US, UK and Western Europe causing a gigantic brain drain and Russian Technology and Science to completely stagnate. 

The solution is to accept that things are unfair and rather than bringing down the ""elite"" private schools, instead try to bring up the level of the State schools. Private schools exist for a reason - because State Schools suck. However noble its intentions, practically speaking, anti-elitism doesn't make the world a fairer place, it makes the world a dumber place. A fun reductio ad absurdum is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut. A society is built upon absolute fairness and no one can be seen to be better or inherently privileged over others. 

*In the year 2081, amendments to the Constitution dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. The Handicapper General's agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear ""handicaps"": masks for those who are too beautiful, radios inside the ears of intelligent people, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.*

&gt; How can someone who's life experience is alien to the majority of the population truly represent the average person?

* Can a male product manager at a tech startup accommodate for the needs of female users? 
* Can a black person understand what it is like to be white?
* Can a Brit understand what life is like in North Korea?
* Can a non-Russian speaker truly understand the depths of Dostoyevsky's works? 

Nothing can truly substitute first hand experience, but (despite what many caricatures would lead you to believe) those from wealthy backgrounds are not utterly blind and unsympathetic to others around them. In fact, quite the opposite if you look at the vast philanthropic/charitable efforts that happen in the UK.

Equality of opportunity is not the same as a level playing field. What you want is that everyone is offered the same level of education. However, people *are* offered the same level of education (theoretically). Private education is parents - who have enough money, *their own money* - to put their children in an alternative route. Everyone gets free gym membership, but some will spend more to go to a running academy.

&gt; If I let myself be well educated why not giving you the same quality of education then that is not equality is it?

That's not how it works. Everyone is given the same quality of education that is possible to offer with the resources we (the country) have. Like I said, private education is parents *spending extra* to go further.

&gt; Equality of opportunity equals giving people the same education, access to services

I agree. And that is provided.

&gt; Equality of opportunity equals [...] not having to worry about making money to live

I don't agree. They are totally unrelated.

&gt; I wouldn't mind if every single MP was privately educated if I thought that all state schools gave the same quality of education

That is financially impossible. There is a reason that private education costs parents thousands of pounds. Private education is the *choice of parents*, to use *their own money*, to give *their children* an alternative education.

Equality of opportunity is giving people the opportunity to achieve what they desire, suited to their abilities. If you don't have the abilities, you aren't suited to what you desire. The state gives everyone an education, and the opportunity to succeed. If you don't take that opportunity for whatever reason (family problems, laziness etc.) that isn't the state's fault.",null,0,null,1436207073,null,0,false,0,csu24f2,null,t3_3caa91,null,t1_csu24f2,null,t1_csu1bst,null,null,null,1437635695,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The only comparable situation I can think of was a Superman comic from the early part of the 00s which tried to retcon the previous fifteen years by saying Krypton was more like the 70s version of itself than the version introduced in 86 when the series was rebooted. Mostly, fans wrote off the change as a cheap appeal to nostalgia, but if you go back and read previous stories where Superman deals with Krypton's memories, it all seems to ring false, not because his feelings are inauthentic but because everything is clearly being done with the supposedly ""fake"" Krypton in mind.

Fact. 


I don't think you can ever compare any of your strikers to Henry. Nor any of your attacking players to Bergkamp. Nor any of your midfielder enforcers to Vieira.


Robben was taken to the world stage? All of the players you listed were already world class and you paid way over the market rate to secure them. That includes Cech.


Some facts for you on your spend during Mourinho's first few years:



2003-04: Abramovich's First Season 

Glen Johnson (from West Ham United): £6 million

Geremi (from Real Madrid): £7 million

Damien Duff (from Blackburn Rovers): £17 million

Wayne Bridge (from Southampton): £7 million

Juan Sebastian Veron (from Manchester United): £15 million

Joe Cole (from West Ham United): £6.6 million

Adrian Mutu (from Parma): £15.8 million

Alexei Smertin (from Bordeaux): £3.5 million

Hernan Crespo (from Inter Milan): £16.8 million

Claude Makelele (from Real Madrid): £16.6 million

Scott Parker (from Charlton Athletic): £10 million

Total: £121.3 million



2005 Signings

Arjen Robben (from PSV): £12 million

Mateja Kezman (from PSV): £5 million

Tiago (from Benfica): £8 million

Lassana Diarra (from Le Havre): £1 million

Shaun Wright-Phillips (from Manchester City): £21 million

John Mikel Obi (from Lyn Oslo): £16 million

Khalid Boulahrouz (from Hamburg): £7 million

Ashley Cole (from Arsenal): £5 million

Total: £66 million



Ballack was the cheapest but you got him from Bayern Munch. Hardly an unknown talent. Robben came from PSV, and you basically massively outbid United by £7m to secure him as a 20 year (this was back in 2004). Read this http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3524213.stm.

I've already listed the fringe players who we had in our team from 2007 - 2013, and it's not even up for debate, it's a miracle how Wenger secured top 4 year after year with a core of just 3 players.



On the topic of Wenger's performance against Mourinho, it's bad, I accept. But do you accept Fergie as being the greatest British manager of all time (I do)? If you do, here are some nice facts again:


Fergie vs Mourinho, Played 16, Fergie won 2, Mou won 7, and 7 draws.

Wenger's by comparison vs Mourinho: Played 13, Wenger won 0, Mourinho has won 7, with 5 draws.

Give it 3 more games and that may change. 



Mou is a master tactician although I don't agree (and many more agree with me on this around the world) on his style of play. He sets up heavily efficient defensive units instead of focusing on free flowing attacking football. But yes, hope you enjoyed the facts.

Let me know if you want to continue this argument. Now that Wenger's been given the freedom to spend and more important compete and keep his top players, you are seeing the emergence of a very dangerous squad. Let's see how next season pans out.

Totally agree. It's something Miliband can't be forgiven for, as much as I did think he was a nice, genuine guy. But that argument is lost now. We are not going to win an election by trying to convince the country that what they were told by both parties for five years wasn't true after all - against the tide of the media. It's just not going to happen. We have to let it go. Meanwhile, people are dying because of this Tory government. Ideological purity is a luxury for those rare times of Labour government.

&gt;Kendall tows the Conservative line on Labour being economically dangerous previously. As long as she admits it that will be enough to keep us out of power. If Kendall is admitting it, voters are going to believe it and tar her with the same brush.

No - because the public wants Labour to ""learn its lesson"". That means giving some lip service to things like running a surplus. The sort of thing that doesn't need to be kept to; Osborne got away with *precisely* that broken surplus promise.

Kendall does need to adequately differentiate herself from the Tories. The time for that is after she's become leader (and I think it will not be an unclear difference). Right now, the whole point is to differentiate herself from Andy and Yvette.

As a Blairite myself, I think it's fairly clear that she isn't a Tory. You barely have to scratch the surface to see she's red. But a sensible, *electable* shade of red. She's the next generation after the Blair/Brown years - the public isn't going to blame her for what Labour did when she wasn't even in Parliament.

First time went 100% perfectly - I'd set the app and account up at home, walked to a friend's house then tried it out when it came time to go home. It took literally three minutes between opening the app and sitting in the cab. I couldn't believe it.

Second time was at home and went not too bad. I wasn't sure if I was hailing the taxi correctly, as you appear to just have to drag the pushpin over the street you want to go to (there's no *enter* or *go* or *hail* button). I ended up typing my destination street in, and a taxi appeared on the screen and started driving towards me (after about five minutes of trying and getting *""we're busy right now""*). The problem was my inputted destination was ten miles out in Iron Acton, not Bedminster. A short minor panic attack later, and the driver explained that his fee is based on where his taxi goes (i.e. I gave him turn by turn directions myself), not necessarily the destination input you use (but it helps). Make sure you know the postcode, because it can't work out street names for shit.

The third time was on the way home again. It took bloody ages to get a taxi, and he appeared to come from the other side of the city to get me so I think there aren't that many drivers out there in Bristol right now. Probably took about thirty minutes all in all.

It has huge potential, but only once more drivers and firms get on-board. The prices are decent enough, but I'm still not 100% sure if I'm using the app correctly. I wouldn't like to explain to my gran how to use it. The app needs more positive feedback to reassure the user that it's doing something.

null,false,epeeist,null,null,null,"Obviously NI hasn't had an official flag for a long time, but in practice the Ulster Banner is still widely used and recognised. Does this represent contentedly *Northern Irish* nationalists? There is nothing Irish whatsoever about that flag, right down to the semantics of equating Ulster with NI. Now, for hardline nationalists, no flag but the tricolour will ever do. Hardline unionists will strongly oppose any replacement for the flag they already like and identify with. But for *everyone else*, who will have some combination of Northern Irish and/or British and/or Irish aspects to their national identity, a more balanced symbol would be a very positive step.

It could even be a simple change. Why not use the Ulster Banner, but swap the cross of St George for St Patrick? It ties in with the union flag and it represents a distinct Irishness, even in the context of the union. As wishy-washy as all this talk of inclusion/balance/compromise probably sounds, the simple fact of that matter is that the current flags and symbols only lend themselves to territorial pissing contests.

Our politicians are too short-sighted to see how this sort of thing would help their constitutional agendas. One of the biggest obstacles to both a united Ireland and long-term integration with Britain is the fact that NI is seen as a tribal basket case. Neither government, and neither population, is falling over itself to rule/fund our intractable bunfight. However, despite seeking small cultural concessions e.g. on Irish, I don't believe that SF have any interest in making NI a welcoming place for nationalists. They might get too comfortable and fail to vote against the border. Likewise, the DUP have no interest in dismantling the symbols of unionist ascendancy in case their voters get too cosy with the idea of being slightly Irish.

But as someone who is from This Bit Of Land Here wherever the hell the border is drawn, I don't want my kids to feel that when it comes to their national identity, they fall between two stools.",null,0,null,1436210783,null,0,false,0,csu4lje,null,t3_3ca3n3,null,t1_csu4lje,null,t3_3ca3n3,null,null,null,1437637226,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

MLS buys the players, not the clubs. It's a big franchise, where the aim is to have it as competitive as possible.

null,false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,null,"&gt; but when has he shown compassion and empathy for people other than Clara?

* If you look at him when Gretchen sacrifices her life in Into The Dalek he is definitely regretful and sad and seems extremely sincere when he says he will name something amazing after her. She didn't necessarily have to die, the other soldier was dead the second he shot the weapon. His joking was probably a mix of not understanding how much the other soldiers actually cared about the man and his terrible attempts to lighten the mood.

* At the end of Robot of Sherwood he came to like Robin and in the end gave him the gift of his one true love. I would say that shows a lot of compassion and empathy. He could have just let Robin find her on his own, but he cut out all of that waiting.

* In Listen that speech he gives young Rupert about fear is definitely an act of fatherly care.

* In Time Heist he is at a loss and visibly sad when he knows Saibra is about to die and he is overjoyed to see Saibra and Psi still alive. **He engineered all of Time Heist as a huge show of compassion and empathy**. He gave Psi the ability to restore his memories, Saibra the ability to cure her mutation, the Teller the chance to restore his love and his species, and even gave Karabraxos the chance for redemption and absolution. He wouldn't have done any of this if he didn't care.

* In The Caretaker he is trying to take care of something that is his fault (the robot was drawn to the area because of the artron emissions from his TARDIS constantly materializing in the area) quietly and without hurting or causing accidental harm to anyone. If Danny hadn't gotten involved, the Doctor would have succeeded. It is understandable why he would be mad. Yes he was rude to Danny, but then again he is rude to everyone.

* Kill the Moon was his poor attempt at showing care for and trust in humanity by saying I cannot make all of the choices for you, you need to stand on your own and I respect whatever choice that you make. He isn't human though and didn't understand that this would not be seem as empathy but rather condescension.

* In Mummy he took away all of Maisie's grief and stood up to the mummy the second he was able to. And he explains himself. It isn't that he is heartless, it's that he doesn't have time to care, he doesn't have time to say I'm sorry, and is saying sorry really more compassionate than expending every last second of your time trying to save as many lives as you can.

* In Flatline he shows a lot of empathy initially to the Boneless and it could probably be argued that he was too empathetic allowing people to die before he acted properly. He didn't banish the Boneless until he was sure they were playing the role of the monster.

* In Forest there is the whole admission that he cares for the Earth and that he pretty much considers it a second home. ""I walk your Earth, I breathe your air&gt;""

* In Dark Water/Death in Heaven he seems generally moved not only by Clara's plight but Danny's as well. And his whole speech is about how he helps out where he isn't a bad or good person he just learns and helps where he can.

Please tell me you're taking the piss? It's because he was educated and lives in the South where most people speak like that. You don't need a thick Yorkshire accent to be considered a normal person.

So, I had a couple of friends visit this weekend, one of which happened to grow up on the Belgian border of France. I thought we'd go to La Trappiste as this is a real passion of his. The drinks are around £4 a 330ml bottle - just to outline the pricepoint and expected service you'd think you'd get...anyway... We spent a good hour or so there drinking a range of lovely beers and were even permitted to use a special glass my friend had requested. We were having a great time.

On one round, as the person serving us changed, the new waiter - great chap btw, had a good laugh with him - suggested we get something on tap. I just asked for the same as I had been having by bottle. When we got the drinks, I was disappointed to find my pint was as flat as a British ale, which wasn't what I had been experiencing with the sparkling bottle. My French bud tasted it too and he, as someone very familiar with this beer, confirmed it was off. No biggie, we thought, this is an every day occurrence, we will just get it swapped. We took it to the bar, and sure enough got it swapped for a bottle - as we knew that was good - and everyone was happy.

Now this is where the story should stop. However the shift manager is an arsehole who learned customer service from Basil Fawlty.

We're enjoying our beers when the manager comes out looking like he's on the warpath. He opens by brashly telling us that we can't have a pint of a drink poured and then not pay for it just because we don't like it. We explain that it wasn't that we simply did't like it, but that it was not of an equal quality to the beer I had been drinking before. He dismisses this, saying that of course the draught beer would be a different experience. We would have to pay half for the beer at least.

My French friend (thank God he was around to call him out on this) piped up and said that draught is not flatter, it is *more* sparkling and fresh and this is not how this tastes on tap back home. To which - and this is the first of two humdingers in this anecdote - the shift manager told my friend ""you don't get this drink on tap in Belgium"". This should have been enough to show us all we were dealing with someone who is not just lazy or incompetent, but an actual, utter moron as a) on what planet do breweries produce barrels for international distribution only and b) my friend had already established that he grew up drinking Belgian beers in pubs; responding like this to my friend's comment is pretty damn confrontational with almost no sense to it.

As someone who hates conflict and much prefers conceding a small problem like flat beer for the greater good of peace and quiet, I told the manager - we don't want to be difficult or put you in a bad position, if you are saying this because it will have bad implications for you, we will just do as you say. After all, I can just email the owner later to complain (I'm a slime). The manager, taking this as an olive branch says OK and agrees to go taste the beer and see what is up...note, this is the moment we found out he had not even tasted the beer he had been defending. He comes back with a shot of beer, taken from the tap, for us to taste. It was good. A unanimous agreement was reached - this was good, my pint wasn't; something had been wrong with it. Admitting the issue FINALLY, he leaves us be, parting with a friendly encouraging invitation to try the draft before I leave.

This was another opportunity to leave on good(ish) terms. The worst the manager had done at this point was be a bit incompetent and do things in the wrong order. But no, it gets even shittier...this next bit is why I said my experience was nasty rather than bad. I started to feel a genuine sense of malice coming from this guy.

Either through naivety, a will to find a solid resolution, or out of a subconscious enthusiasm for drama, I asked for a half of this beer on tap for my next drink. As I asked, my French friend got up to go to the loo. Very sudden for him, but we thought, OK. He came back, neck craned, watching the bar at all times. I had no idea what he was doing. Our drinks then came, mine looking a little headier than it had done before. But...not only flat, but also hardly chilled whatsoever! My friend checks this and swiftly gets up - I was worried he was going to lamp someone, but as it turned out, on his return, he had gone to reinspect the bar. Yes, as he suspected, the original flat pint that had been sitting behind the bar was now half empty. That cheeky bastard!

He takes my drink to the bar and explains that he knows exactly what they've done. After a failed attempt to convince my friend they had drunk half a pint in his absense (seriously, they said this to his face), very little otherwise is given in the way of defense; in fact one of the other members of staff congratulated my friend on sticking up for himself. It was apparent at different points in the night that we were not the only ones to have difficulty with this ""testicle in the paté"", as my friend referred to him - he was consistently short and dismissive of the staff he was managing. A nasty piece of work all in all.

So, yea, we got a replacement drink, necked everything and went off to another pub where we wouldn't feel like we were being threatened with having poor beer palmed off to us at £6 a pint. After a pretty reasonable pint at the Bell and Crown (all hail the bell and crown!!!) we headed back. Being a little merry, we thought we'd get on looking up the name of the owner of La Trappiste and start drafting a letter to him - and that's when we found the above article. I wouldn't be surprised if the beer we were drinking from the tap yesterday was gone off or stale; I would not put it past someone who has knowingly been handling stolen goods and putting such horrible people in authority positions to do such a thing.

Anyway, yea, avoid the place. And if you run a café or restaurant in Canterbury and you want some new staff, please go save those poor sods, they don't deserve to have to deal with that either.

Not in practice though. 

&gt; Equality of opportunity is not the same as a level playing field. 

I think that is pretty simplistic. 

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/

I wouldn't claim my interpretation is the only viable one but it is certainly one of the most common. 

&gt;Private education is parents - who have enough money, their own money - to put their children in an alternative route. 

Exactly, this creates differnet classes. The classes being definied by how much or little of this kind of privilege they have. 

&gt;Everyone gets free gym membership, but some will spend more to go to a running academy.

Yes but as it stands many people don't have the choice. They don't have the facilities and decline to use them. They are differnet things. 

&gt;Everyone is given the same quality of education that is possible to offer with the resources we (the country) have.

That simply isn't true. 

&gt;Like I said, private education is parents spending extra to go further.

You say that like that somehow makes it fair and not an advantage?

&gt;I agree. And that is provided.

Lol but it clearly isn't. Even the Tories say public education needs improving :S 

&gt;I don't agree. They are totally unrelated.

How so? 

I'm not saying worrying about getting a holiday or something. Do you think someone/a family who struggles to afford food, make rent, etc despite being as frugal as possible isn't at a disadvantage?

&gt;That is financially impossible. There is a reason that private education costs parents thousands of pounds. Private education is the choice of parents, to use their own money, to give their children an alternative education.

Well I say scrap private schools. Cleary not going to agree because your points only stand if wealth is always deserved and/or earnt when it clearly isn't. 

&gt;Equality of opportunity is giving people the opportunity to achieve what they desire, suited to their abilities.

Yes and that doesn't happen. People can't always fufill their desire (not even ridiculous stuff like becoming a rock star or whatever, lots of people feel they can't complete the degree they need because of cost or responsiblities as a carer. 

For example look at the report published by the Alzheimers Society today how something like 70% of people with Alzheimers rely on family members for the majority of their care. When a rich family can pay for proffesional carers how is this euqal?

You have your head buried in the sand mate. I can list millions of instances where inherited wealth gives you a substantial benefit that isn't at all based on personal merit.

&gt;The state gives everyone an education, and the opportunity to succeed. 

Yes I agree. There is oppotunity, things aren't that bad. It is just there isn't an equal playing field. 

&gt;If you don't take that opportunity for whatever reason (family problems, laziness etc.) 

That is inhumane. The state has a responsiblity to help people with family problems (not with laziness of course). For example the Alzheimers carers example. IPeople with disabled children. Victims of abuse. And so on. All of those things can be helped directly (hiring carers) or indirectly (being able to take time off and do therapy) 

How can you equate family problems of a child with laziness? Seriously what the fuck. You really think that they are comparable examples of things that are the person's fault and the state doesn't have a role in.

The issue it is far to easy to avoid. You hide companies behind shell companies; contract your lower wage workers to separate agencies &amp; turn more of your top pay into various non-wage compensation. It would most likely unfairly hit small to medium sized businesses while larger corporations would avoid it or simply move their workforce away from the UK entirely.

All of which just makes me think of psychopathic the whole thing is; just pay people enough to live on, have some fun once in a while (we work to live, we do not live to work), and put a little into savings.

You are saying I am proposing a completely equal society, I'm not, that isn't possible. And much of what you talk about is equality of outcome NOT equality of oppotunity. BUT, there is a lot more we can to achieve a fair society. There is a big gap between where we are now and the hyperbolic vision of Vonnegut, it is a misrepresentation of the truth to pretend otherwise. 

For example providing everyone with a state education is much fairer than allowing those born into wealth to pay for the best education posisble. Why can't we abolish private schools? That is a practical and achievable change that would ensure equality of oppourtunity. The only argument I hear is ""but then we get rid of the best schools"". Well so what, we should be focussing on providing the best education for everyone. Not allowing 7% society to recieve an education that gives them a distinct advantage in almost any walk of lfie.

Content wise I don't know how much it will grab non-Southampton fans, I found it interesting but some guy in the US or Canada who only has a passing interest at the moment might get bored.

It was great hearing about the transfer system again though. It's nice to know that we aren't going to chuck money at a player who suddenly becomes 'available' on the market. We clearly don't base our signings entirely on just last season form, so however negative the reaction about one of our signings is I guess the scouts must have seen something in them that fits what Koeman asks for. Obviously they won't all end up working out but seemingly more often than not we're in with a good shot.

I guess it's the same reason we aren't getting linked much with players like Austin or whatever. The papers and fans can only see ""that player is good + that player is probably available + that team needs that position = transfer!"".

Homeowners suddenly faced with negative equity will simply not sell, you Johnny First-Time-Buyer won't have a house to buy. 

Banks will suffer a liquidity crisis as a huge chunk of their mortgage portfolios won't be backed by equity. This means banks will want to see something closer to 50% deposits to ensure against depreciation and to balance their portfolios and they'll only lend to the most financially secure of candidates. This means Johnny First-Time-Buyer won't be able to buy these houses that aren't on the market anyway because, unless he's got a huge chunk of cash to drop, he won't be eligible for a mortgage. Even if he is, he'll have to stomach depreciation. 

So all that's left for Johnny First-Time-Buyer is to rent until things cool down, with everyone else who was looking to buy. With a huge surge in demand for renting, rents will increase. 

On top of that, for those already on the ladder, consumer spending is directly correlated with house prices, whether you like it or not (I don't like it, but there you go) because a drop in equity to break-even or negative equity is a precarious position for many, meaning they cut back just in case. A drop in consumer spending hurts the economy, potentially putting Johnny First-Time-Buyer's job at risk. 

So no, it wouldn't be good to see a drop in house prices as nobody benefits (except for a few BTL landlords who can buy outright maybe). The best thing would be price stagnation until wages catch up some more.

This was the initial comment in this thread. Fair comment I'd say.

The

&gt;made him look a bit more normal

portion was then replied to by MMstingray who speculated that this is due to the privileged lifestyle a disproportionate number of politicians enjoy.  

Britishchink then pointed out that he wants highly educated successful people running the country

Thepheonix then pointed out that George Osbourne's education is not directly related to his ministerial role.

That is the story of how some criticism of the Tory party entered the thread. This process is sometimes known as a discussion. They occasionally crop up. Often times they will stray from direct description of the initial talking point to consider related issues.

The discussion regarding the pros and cons of different educational attainments is continuing below so it seems to me that those involved are enjoying and/or taking some value from it.

Given this I would humbly suggest that rather than there being

They'll both make good commuters although the Bonnie will need more polishing. The other thing to bear in mind is the Bonnevilles have fairly poor suspension and seats straight from the factory so factor the cost of swapping out the rear shocks and possibly the seat into the equation.

It can be incredibly strong and your comment is dangerously misleading.

If anyone is trying that shit for the first time, DO NOT have a bong. DO have only 3 blasts of a spliff and wait a minute to see how it hits you. If you are still okay, have another 3 blasts and wait again. My advice would be to stay well clear of it though, it's just far too strong.

But hampering people based on their upbringing and hours of teaching and nurturing their parents and family have put into things is exactly the direction this is heading in.

&gt; For example providing everyone with a state education is much fairer than allowing those born into wealth to pay for the best education posisble. 

If I can afford to pay Mr. Scientist to teach programming to my kid, then why shouldn't I? This is a basic economic right. The coaches at Arsenal and Chelsea are picked because they are the absolute best - they can afford it and you can't really stop them from doing that.

One can be bitter from one's parents not being able to afford x school or some other person having more contacts in a field through family connections - but to say these things are ""unfair"" is to only look at the issue at face value. Humans work in family units and look after family first. Deep down, people want to be better, richer, more intelligent and more successful than their peers and that is what pushes humanity forward. 
In any field of industry, if you really, really want to get into it, then you will - regardless of connections or privileges. Perhaps some fields will be tougher for some people but so what? Rather than envying the ""lucky"", perhaps make friends and try to work with them?

&gt; The only argument I hear is ""but then we get rid of the best schools"". Well so what, we should be focussing on providing the best education for everyone. 

Why do we have tiers in anything? My macbook pro is better than a 500 quid netbook because I paid more, apple have the best designers, hire the cream of the cream of engineers and cherry pick the best hardware. Yes it is unfair to vast swaths of sub-saharan africa who have computers from the 1-laptop-per-child project, and yes this gives me an advantage when working. But should apple give up all their tech secrets and patents to level the playing field for Lenovo et al?

Your solution brings down everyone's level. I'd rather we have a hierarchy, with aspiration and inspiration to reach the top; instead of everyone being brought down to the same shitty level of local comprehensives.

Because we are human. It is not possible to account for individual teachers' (unintended) biases, family context, peer dynamics, location etc. 

&gt; I think that is pretty simplistic

This is politics after all, not philosophy. A level playing field is what you want: a world where every child is offered every opportunity and every bit of support from the whole of society to achieve their desired social status. That is simply not possible because of economic costs, political costs, logistical costs, social context, wasteful/ineffective application, accidents, the contribution of parents, the delicacy of the *child*'s feelings/desires, the undetermined benefits, everything else that would come with such a monumental human project.

What *I* think is that we have the next best thing. It is as much of a level playing field as we can realistically achieve, and any improvement will be an improvement to a current system, it won't be a massive overhaul we would need to achieve a complete level playing field.

&gt; many people don't have the choice

That's not the intention. The state's intention is to offer free education, pure and simple. 93% of parents take the offer. 7% don't.

&gt; You say that like that somehow makes it fair and not an advantage

It *is* an advantage, but it is fair. The alternative would be banning parents from spending money on what they want for their kids.

&gt; How so? Do you think someone/a family who struggles to afford food, make rent, etc despite being as frugal as possible isn't at a disadvantage?

Of course they're at a disadvantage, but that's got nothing to do with opportunity. They still have the opportunity, but for one reason or another it hasn't been taken. It could be time, competition, economic context. Whatever it is, they haven't been denied the opportunity just because they are low on money.

&gt; your points only stand if wealth is always deserved and/or earnt when it clearly isn't

That's got nothing to do with it. If someone has money, in one way or another somebody else has given that to them. Richard Branson didn't make his own money, other people were buying his products. An heir to property didn't give themselves that property, somebody else did. You cannot determine if they deserved it and you can't determine how they spend it.

&gt; 70% of people with Alzheimers rely on family members for the majority of their care

And I agree with you that something should be done about that.

&gt; state has a responsiblity to help people with family problems. For example the Alzheimers carers example. People with disabled children. Victims of abuse.

Yes I completely agree with those instances. But family problems could simply include seperation, a hostile environment, disregard, parental pressure. These instances aren't illegal and are the business of the family alone, and there's only so much the school/social services can help.

&gt; How can you equate family problems of a child with laziness? Seriously what the fuck

I wasn't equating or comparing them, I was simply listing them. I mentioned laziness because it's a definite factor in whether a child achieves his potential in school.

One, I'd agree; but depending on the Season, I think one of those hearts can be shrunk tight with defensive chill because it's been worn down or badly wounded, and will take some time to heal.  He doesn't actually go around looking for people to save, most of the time; he stumbles, via the Tardis usually, into situations that imperil various intelligent species, and he likes to see himself as a good guy *and* he likes to show off, so he'll try to help where he can, taking the weaker side if he can figure out which it is because that's what good guys do.  

As for his compassion, KATPOR answers that well below, but let me add that if you didn't see the expression on the Doctor's face when Saibra died in Time Heist, you clearly missed a very clear moment of dread and grief at seeing someone he didn't even know that well die right before his eyes without being able to do anything about it. The camera lingers a moment on his face, so you won't miss it.

And don't forget the dinosaur in DB: she bursts into flames, and he is horrified, pointing out that she's only here and burning because she swallowed the Tardis and the Tardis came here; ""Look what I did,"" he says, and he's damn near crying.  And then, referring to this death of a gigantic lizard, he says, ""The question is, have there been other murders like this?""  Who else would care enough about a dinosaur to refer to its death as a murder? 

Now, as for kindness -- 12 is not slathering it about, I grant you, but I think we'll see more of that side of him as he begin to function more freely after the period of fearful confusion he went through in S8.  ""Fear can make you kind"", Clara says, but in S8 we've had a demonstration of how you act when you're not strong and wise enough -- for a time, anyway -- for fear to make you kind.  Look for better in S9, is my advice, and don't worry about the writing.  Moffat is a talented writer, with a talented team of writers around him, a great cast, and some fine directors.  None of them are perfect, but all of them are trying their very best to do the top job they can for a show they love -- they're all fans too, after all.

null,false,Boonsquemador,null,null,null,"&gt;But, i can tell you don't like Oscar. I noticed you are one of the most negative fans on this sub. You are almost always complaining about how some of our players aren't good enough. How many Chelsea players you don't like? It used to be Ramires, Mikel and Willian. And now, it is mainly Oscar and Cuadrado

what  are you on about? I like Oscar and have said that I dont want us to sell him EVEN FOR POGBA. Ramires is one of my favourite Chelsea players and when other people say we should sell him I've defended him on here. Look at the Arsenal match thread if you dont believe me. Cuadrado as well? I haven't said anything against him, once again look at countless match threads where other people have told me Cuadrado was shit and I defended him. I've never said that I want Cuadrado gone. 

You've made this all up. I haven't changed my mind about anything. You've just listed random players and said I'm negative about them when I know for a fact its bullshit because ive been one of the few people defending Cuadrado on this sub reddit whilst he was here. 

If you're going to say that prove it. If I complained about them during the season and wanted Cuadrado shipped off. And Turan? wtf are you talking about I'll get my comments for him...... 

https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3bshsp/rumours_news_petr_cech_farewell_edition/csp5gzc

https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3br56g/if_we_sign_turan_what_role_will_he_play/csp1k4u?context=3

I said I dont want Turan if he is just a RWer for us. And part of the reason is BECAUSE WE HAVE CUADRADO. the player ive defended and talked up for months ffs. 

Cuadrado comment from 6 days ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3bmis7/inter_milan_chasing_chelsea_duo_john_obi_mikel/csnk7oj?context=3

Another comment where I'm talking up Cuadrado and Oscar

https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3av3sf/just_found_this_in_my_hard_drive/csgeiqs

I dont dislike Oscar, I say the truth about his performances because I'm honest and want to see him improve because I know he can be much better than this. That's a better view to have on Oscar than someone like you who bullshits into accepting performances of a standard that aren't good enough from the player they are coming from. I've said countless times that I dont want Pogba (paul pogba!!!!) the person everyone raves about because I want to keep Oscar as our no10. 

And Willian as well complete crap. If you've followed my account long enough to make these sweeping statements lies then link proof. I'm not overexagerrating anything I say these things because I care about the players and want them to become better so WE DONT NEED TO BUY PLAYERS FOR THEIR PLACE. In the Arsenal sub reddit I got downvoted to shit for saying I think Willian is better than Ozil. 

Cahill as well? I said I wanted him to come back to form and when he did I praised the shit out of him. Like in the West Ham match. 

lol found it, funny how I can remember these off the top of my head because I haven't made stuff up like you 

https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/2xy9sm/postmatch_thread_chelsea_vs_west_ham_a_1_0/cp4ibtu


Everybody on the sub reddit wanted Zouma to play for him whilst he was in bad form, if I slammed any defenders this year it was Ivanovic for the period when he was keeping Luis on the bench despite being so shaky defensively, ironically that was also during the time when people here were blaming Cahil for every goal that went in. 

I cant get onto the website now but i'll edit this comment once I can get onto search reddit comments so I can find my comments about Oscar and Pogba. Not gonna lie I've never seen as much bullshit as in this comment, I'll remember this the next time I see your name. I know I haven't spoken badly about most of the players you put, let alone wanting any apart from Mikel to leave. If there is anyone on that list I want to leave it is Mikel and thats simply because we need to let RLC take his place, I still like the guy too. Also just to end I'm not heartbroken that he went to Barca I am worried about what that means for the other potential signing Griezmann now that Atletico have sold so many of their best players.

In KarmaUK's first comment.

MMAstingrays follow up about privileged upbringing was in fact not specifically talking about the Tories but politicians in general. 

I guess my point is that your comments, in their phrasing, came over as very defensive and unnecessarily keen to shut down discussion. Perhaps this was as a result of you coming into the thread with a £100 hair trigger waiting to be pulled at the first sight of Tory bashing because you'd already decided discussion of privilege in the political classes (or specifically the Conservative party) had no place here. This might have meant you didn't see that the discussion reached that point organically and not as a result of some insidious r/unitedkingdom agenda push.

I'd disagree with that. How is somebody privately educated supposed to prove to you that they're qualified to do a job if they're immediately dismissed based on something they had no control of? How is that any better than dismissing a state-educated politician? People should be treated equally based on merit regardless of education.

Translation:

""Even if Crystal Palace have put together an offer for the PSG midfielder, Cabaye, the latter has given his preference to another Premier League club: West Ham.

If his future is fluid, then one thing is sure: Yohan Cabaye will rejoin the Premier League this summer -- only 1 year after departing Newcastle for PSG. Even if Crystal Palace, where Cabaye's old manager with the Magpies--Pardew--is now in charge, have made an offer of 14m Euro, the 29 year-old has made his desire to play for someone else clear.

In essence, given the information from Le Parisien, Cabaye wishes to join a more prestigious club than Crystal Palace, namely West Ham. He would rejoin an old Ligue 1 teammate, Dimitri Payet, from LOSC in 2011.

As a small anecdote, Cabaye actually scored his first two Premier League goals with Newcastle against West Ham on January 18, 2014.""


Original:

""Si Crystal Palace aurait formulé une offre pour le milieu de terrain du PSG, Yohan Cabaye, ce dernier aurait donné sa préférence à un autre club de Premier League, West Ham.

Si l'identité de son futur club est encore floue, une chose est sure, Yohan Cabaye va rejoindre la Premier League cet été, seulement 1 an et demi après avoir quitté Newcastle pour rejoindre le Paris Saint-Germain. Si Crystal Palace, où Cabaye retrouverait son ancien technicien chez les Magpies, Alan Pardew, aurait formulé une offre de 14 millions d'euros, le milieu de 29 ans aurait un penchant pour une autre destination.

En effet, selon les informations du quotidien Le Parisien, Yohan Cabaye souhaiterait rejoindre un club un peu plus huppé que Crystal Palace, West Ham. Il rejoindrait ainsi un ancien pensionnaire de Ligue 1, dont il a croisé le chemin au LOSC en juin 2011, Dimitri Payet.

Note that UCL suggests London living expenses of [£322 per week](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/fees-funding/tuition-fees/living-expenses) *including* the Christmas and Easter breaks.

If you do not think that you want to/can afford to study in London, there are other good universities around the UK. You could also do re-takes over the next year, and spend some of the spare time with a part-time job earning some money, either to finance your studies or just to spend on a nice holiday to get some real-world experience.



If you can't go where you really want to, I suggest taking an extra year to go there. There's no shame in it, most university admissions departments won't penalise you for it (check with them if you are in doubt) and you can read around the subject, try to get semi-related work experience, and go into uni with a slightly wiser head on your shoulders.

Lots of my friends didn't have any parental assistance at uni and managed to get by, QM has lots of student jobs on campus which is great because they're super flexible with schedules as obviously they understand that your work load fluctuates, also there are lots of waiter-ing companies that love students (you pick which shifts you want to work) and the minimum wage in london is higher than elsewhere. 

London can be expensive but there are a lot of free activities you can do too, not everyone is running around drinking Moet at some posh bar on the Kings Road.

&gt;

&gt;The ___New Statesman___ is a British political and cultural [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine) published in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London). Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, connected with [Sidney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Webb) and [Beatrice Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Webb), and other leading members of the socialist [Fabian Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society). The magazine has, according to its present self-description, a left-of-centre political position. 

&gt;The longest serving editor was [Kingsley Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsley_Martin) (1930–60). The current editor is [Jason Cowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Cowley), who assumed the post at the end of September 2008. The magazine has notably recognized and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers. Its contributors have included J M Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Hitchens and Paul Johnson.

&gt;Historically, the magazine was sometimes affectionately referred to as ""The Staggers"" because of crises in funding, ownership and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog.  Its current regular writers, critics and columnists include [Mehdi Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Hasan), [Will Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Self), [John Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Gray), [Laurie Penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Penny), [Ed Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Smith_(cricketer\)) and Helen Lewis. Circulation peaked in the mid 1960s.  and the magazine had a certified average [circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_circulation) of 29,353 in 2014. Traffic to the magazine's website reached a record high in October 2013, with 2.68 million unique visitors.

Why were the English laws totally suspended during the Olympics (and shops got no custom anyway), yet remain in place even literally the last weekend before Christmas when everyone's rushing around?  Joke.  I remember a couple of years back I was at home for Christmas, noting that Tesco Extra in Edinburgh was so busy there were no free parking spaces... at 5:30pm on a Sunday.

It's these daft trading laws which caused the smaller Metro stores to spring up like weeds as well.  Thatcher wanted the Scottish model in 1986, yet people whinged.

It would work brilliantly if there was some official standard that university exams and coursework had to adhere to (i.e. the exams were standardised across institutions, just like A levels for big boys and girls). But university exams are written and marked by academics from that uni (with input from external examiners for finalists), so although broadly the content will be similar between similar courses at different unis, the mark you get at the end of it cannot be used as a comparison between two students because they have learned different things and sat different exams. 

Hell, even within my department marking was inconsistent. My uni used a 17 point marking system which associates vague adjectives describing a piece of work to a numerical mark ([details for anybody interested](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/categories/examinations/marking/guidance/teacherguidance/)). A marker has to look at a piece of work and decide ""is this piece of work of low-high quality, medium-high quality, almost very high quality, on the lower end of very high quality or very high quality?"". The result is that coursework marks were: 

 * really quite arbitrary. Most of the time a fuck up would mean you got a 58% or a 62%, if you worked your bollocks off you might get a 65% or a 68%. Firsts were quite hard to get because to say something is ""on the lower end of very high quality"" the marker has to justify a relative increase of 6% over ""almost very high quality"". 

 * a lottery. For a lot of people it didn't matter what you did, 68% was the maximum you were going to get even if you pulled out something magic from your arse. Other people could hand in a half-finished piece of shit and get 81%. There was always a scramble to pick the coursework pieces that would be assessed by generous markers because it really did make that much of a difference. 

This was in the same modules of the same department at the same university. Drawing up a scale to compare students from all universities is going to be meaningless, and will probably just lead to more grade inflation. If institution X makes it quite easy to score an 11 or a 12, and institution Y demands higher standards and rarely gives out 10s because it has a more rigorous course, in the end graduates from X get an advantage despite not necessarily being any better than their counterparts from Y. In the end you'll just end up with the same 2 (or 3) bands that indicate success with everything below it indicative of a student who didn't try. 

On the other hand, there were a lot of firsts on the pass list for my course this year. I would expect masters level students from a well-respected uni to be quite intelligent and so don't find it that surprising, but it does diminish the achievement a little to think it is pretty commonplace.

""Defamation"" is, in the simplest terms, lying about a person in a way that harms their reputation.  It's not enough to just be mistaken or to repeat an opinion; you have to know that what you're saying is a lie and represent it as the truth.

From what you've described, it sounds like your co-workers have presented facts about you (""he said he might kill me""; ""he gave me a letter about wanting to be a serial killer"") and formed opinions on you based on those facts.  Someone has obviously formed the professional opinion that you need psychiatric treatment.  I don't think, from what you've said above, that you've alleged that your co-workers have *lied* about you; only that they've misinterpreted your jokes.

It's so difficult to get bed space for patients who've been *sectioned*, I don't think you've been placed in a psychiatric hospital for nothing.  I know it must be frustrating for you and you're probably experiencing some very distressing feelings about the situation, but perhaps what has happened to you is for the best.

null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"&gt;ISIS started in Syria

The Iraqi insurgency was to an extent ""based"" in Syria. The border is completely porous &amp; it was a constant source of refuge and supplies. With over a million Iraqi refugees in Syria they had plenty of friends and groups to hide amongst. 

&gt; They are an Sunni extremists, not representative of the 'third of the country' who were blocked from power. 

Some are but the bulk of their ranks are just Sunni's fed up being brutalised by the Iraqi government. They were the ones in those infamous US torture photos and the Iraqi government was/is far worse than that with them. Our media focuses on the crazies for obvious reasons. A large army  cannot exist without large numbers of recruits and a civilian population on their side. 

If ""ISIS"" were a lot smaller then the narrative that they are all ""extremists"" might carry some weight. Much of the horrific stuff they are doing like decapitations are just ""normal"" parts of war rather than religiously driven fanaticism. They've just not generally occurred a) in an era with ubiquitous camera phones and b) with a group we want to demonize. Videos of US/Iraqi soldiers brutally torturing, raping and killing people get redacted/destroyed by the Pentagon/CIA while those of ISIS doing the same go on CNN at prime time.

That's war for you, the reality is only seen when it suits us. Nothing ISIS has done is historically ""shocking"", it certainly wouldn't shock a veteran of the Vietnam War. We did our utmost to downplay this when they were initially on our side in Syria, people were calling them out on it at the time for the shit that wasn't making the news.

&gt; sometimes it's not actually our fault. 

Indeed but this one absolutely is. 

Consider what would happen tomorrow in Northern Ireland if Catholics were to be banned entirely from politics and all forms of government service.

I don't think there is anything about only being entitled to holiday pay after 6 months.  Typically contracts would state that you may only take holiday you have already accrued in the first 6 months (to stop someone from taking their full holiday entitlement and disappearing).

It most certainly isn't legal to not pay for holiday that you have ""booked off"" and received the proper approval for, speak to your manager and ask for it to be put through payroll ASAP.
