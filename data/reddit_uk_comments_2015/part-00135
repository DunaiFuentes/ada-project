Police will generally wait for a keyholder and go inside with them and find he actual cause, not just assume everything is fine because the windows aren't broken

Secondly, in my experience, they don't stop attending after that point they just start charging.

Finally. I attended alarms, probably 12 a week for a couple of years. I only had 2 that were a break in in all my time doing the job. The reality is, people buy these systems and don't know how to use them. 

Christmas was horrible, every school would go off because teacher would put tinsel over the PIRs.  We would turn up, move he tinsel so it didn't got off again and then.

One science lab left mice under the alarm. 

No one dusted so PIRs were covered in cobwebs everywhere.

One warehouse had adopted a cat.

Of they haven't had the service on their system done the battery would run out.

They're all fine for a few people to move around in once they're grounded and stable, but they're not structurally sound if you start rocking them side to side.

I don't know if it was because the caravan was old, but it made a lot of creaking noises and it pulled something out of the roof on the far corner and left a small gap.

Looked more like a rhombus than a caravan after that. Apparently his insurance wrote it off saying it wasn't safe any more.

We pulled off from the lights. I only have 6 tons on so was short shifting 480 horse truck gross weight no more than 22 to will get to 30 quite quick. As I was going through the gears the red car passed me I looked in the mirror and saw the box van was not trying to pass I did see a car and caravan but this was behind and to the right of the box van and looked like he was going to pull in behind the box van less than 8 - 10 seconds later glanced in the mirror as something caught my attention. This is when I hit the horn and the brakes as hard as I could. Stopped lorry in around 20 yards and got up on the curb as much as I dare as anyone who knows where this happened will tell you there are large concrete blocks just off the path where I stopped.

I'm on my phone so I can't format at the moment so bare with me :)

- The accommodation you pick for your first year (implying you're moving out) will be where you spend most of you're maintenance grant. It's a good idea to do some thorough research on halls beforehand. I found with my uni  that you really got what you paid for when it came to halls. However a few people I know managed to go privately their first year a saved a fortune. 

- There are many other types of grants out there and your uni will also have their own individual ones usually. It's obvious that you should to apply to as many as possible. 

- Your future housemates themselves IMO will have a large effect on your spending habits also. If you have ones that like to party, then be prepared for increased alcohol spending and noise. End of the day it's up to you but avoid going out too much outside freshers. This will heavily effect your studies and your wallet.

- For food, Aldi all the way. Obviously if you have market stalls nearby check them out. the reality is a lot of the time that you'll get back from a full day of lectures and cooking a meal is just not going to happen. I cooked meals and froze them for times like these. Have them with rice, chips and etc. Buying vegetables usually means that they go start to go off before you can finish them so try canned/frozen veg and try shared fresh with roommates. 

- Only buy kitchen utensils for yourself. 2 sets of knives &amp; forks and etc. We ended up with like 4 cheese graters this year so I'd buy that stuff when you're there. 

- Investing in 2 monitors for your PC (or  one to use with a laptop) will increase your work efficiency greatly. You could buy a printer but I found it ended up printing at the library most the time. My course isn't very paper intensive anyway.   

- Always check on eBay/gumtree/second years for text books. The only £50 textbook I bought this year I used maybe twice despite being the core one for the module. Of course the library will have what you're looking for most the time.

- Keep an eye out for student studies and open days. These usually pay and only take up half a day on the weekend. 

I could go on for more but that'll be annoying for anyone to read and I'm currently in Thailand and want to sleep.

The only way a flag has any value in the modern world is if you accept it as a representation of the people of a country as they are now. That's why ""reclaim"" is a perfectly sensible word and sentiment because many in England feel it has been claimed by people who are a minority among them.

If you're going to say a flag has assigned to it the ancient values our forefathers associated with it, NONE of us could fly any flag that wasn't modern. Go back a few generations and some of our ancestors had attitudes that would make ISIS look like softies.

But yeah, The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List and Forest Gump are all basic as hell. They all show the blatant and pervasive lack of creativity that is evident in Hollywood cinema. 

If Hollywood isn't ""creative"" by your standards, you are on track to make billions.

It's sensible to a liar; truth isn't subject to a vote. You can't re-write history to suit current political attitudes; they are reclaiming bugger all, it never represented their ""progressive"" values to begin with.

A more apt word would be ""appropriate"", i.e. take something and use it in a way that insults the memory of those who bore it. That's awkward though, since cultural appropriation is something Guardian readers like to complain about when it's white people doing it to native Americans or Africans.

Frankly I don't see how it can be reclaimed by people who loathe England so much that they can say things like;

We had one site that pretty much never went off, and it was a pharmaceutical warehouse. That would pretty much always be a police response.

If a customer specified ""always call police"" then that is what they get. This however puts them at the risk on their 3 call outs.

If more than one PIR goes off, then that is what we called a ""confirmed intruder"" and the police are more likely to get a call. (Though if it's 5am, general guess was its the cleaners turning up)

If it's windy, then there is a higher chance that something is blowing inside so less likely to get police attendance.

Effectively, you are weighing these things up, and making a decision whether or not to call the cops.

Usually when you do however, they attend (in fact, in those cases we normally patrolled the outside and then waited for them

I will say, the police force in the area I worked are probably far less busy than the metropolitan police though

----------

The original article would certainly warrant a police response to me - as the monitoring company thought. 

- high risk location
- I would guess aware enough of security to properly look after their alarms system (though if they had three false alarms maybe not)

&gt;6.34 - Same Old Story 
Fri, 10 Apr 2015 06:00:00 GMT


&gt;David Mooney is joined by Rob Pollard and, from the Sunday Mirror, Simon Mullock, to pick the bones out of the defeat to Crystal Palace. Manuel Pellegrini and Gael Clichy give us their thoughts, while we assess the vulnerability of Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano. We look ahead to the Manchester derby, taking good form at Old Trafford but bad form in general. On top of that, Howard Hockin looks at the season ticket renewals packs.

A really sound chat about the club. Mullock makes maybe one too many claims about having heard gossip right from the club, but that doesn't mean he's making it up.

Why?Because we've been collectively bullied in to being ashamed of our own flag by an absolutely fucking miniscule amount of people with outdated views, if these people held similar, open views about homosexuals, trans people, disabled people, whoever, then there'd be a fucking uproar, Gawker and Tumblr would combust, as it does every other day, there'd be ""flag ins"" as people who cared enough took action.Instead it suits people to not defend the flag though, especially in a multicultural society, the argument can, and has, been made that nationalism in even it's smallest form could be upsetting, making people from other countries feel inferior, or that we think we're better than them.We are not allowed pride in our country anymore because of stupid arseholes with prehistoric views and the pussies who are too scared to reclaim a symbol of something that had no right being taken in the first place.

If you are set up and organised (well organised I might add) defensively and the shape is to be more defensive then it becomes a lot easier. Moreno has been in a side where the back 4 (or 5) changes very frequently. We've played 4-4-2 diamond, 4-3-3-, 4-2-3-1 3-4-3, 3-4-2-1. Many formations asking different roles and for a young player from another country already in a side struggling to adapt. Not to mention how we started the season.

I'd basically build a 4-3-3 (or 4-2-3-1 if you like), with lots of players who can roam, not unlike Mourinho's system at Inter, Chelsea, Porto, etc... - with 3 strikers/forwards up top, Coutinho as AM, and Markovic and Can in midfield.  Sakho/Skrtel as central defenders is a no brainer, I like Moreno on the left and Manquillo/Johnson on the right.  

For the attack I've gone with Balo/Lallana/Borini because I think they've all shown phenomenal potential elsewhere, but just haven't fit into Rodgers' system.  They also all seem to complement each other (Lallana/Balo hooked up quite nice earlier this year).

I Love Doctor Who, but feel the themed weddings are pushing the boundaries...

My husband started helping out part time at a friends new restaurant venture, they needed more hands &amp; since ""the rebel flesh"" isn't a real thing yet, they made do with him. Anyway, he notices a waitress with a doctor who phone case, it's the tardis, at the bottom of the ocean with Ariel (the little mermaid) looking at it. 

The waitress, her name is Ariel, she has red hair. That's nice. Very cute. He texts me a picture of the case, I reply that it's cool &amp; funny timing, as I'm binge watching DW at the time. (Plus he knows I always appreciate any DW merchandise, especially the phone case, as I also have red hair, not named Ariel thou) So he sends me a picture of her COFFEE MUG, it's Doctor Who. Then her ENGAGEMENT RING. It's a sapphire, and it's obvious that they looked &amp; looked for that stone, then had it set in white gold because it's tardis-y shaped &amp; therefore similar to her. 

At this point, I'm thinking, ""now I LOVE DW, plan my Saturday's around it when the series is on, but this chick, is taking it to a NEW LEVEL""...

Then he tells me she is having a DW themed wedding. And I'm like, no, now it's too far. Then he drops the final AND ULTIMATE, B-O-M-B...

Her DW themed wedding? Is going to be at the Convention I attend every year. 

I'm all for showing the love to your favorite show/music/artist/car/pet/best friend (??? Maybe not w/ one of those silly 1990's ""best friend"" necklaces...) but to plan your wedding, to theme the whole affair AFTER A SHOW, then pay mo' money, just to have that themed wedding, AT A CONVENTION? At least no one will be lost on the reference to what Doctor Who IS. Still, that's a whole lot of cash to spend on just setting your weddings ""tone"", you could get married in a f-ing blue tardis dress &amp; spend the savings on a fab honeymoon. 

Though, I will say that last year, the weekend of the same DW convention an unfortunate, ""not there for the convention"" wedding took place in the middle of the convention at the hotel, right in the thick of the various Doctors, Daleks &amp; weeping Angels...I remember feeling bad for the bride, she was just like ""WTF"" when she saw all the DW hoopla going down with no idea what DW WAS. 

Was entertaining though...anyway, my point is, DW themed weddings? Yes, I agree. That's too much...just STAPH with those!!!!",null,0,null,1428733766,null,0,false,0,cq8mbwp,null,t3_31umeo,null,t1_cq8mbwp,null,t1_cq5sdf8,null,null,null,1432326261,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

If we sack him at the end of the season we will have to go through yet another period of transition, and we never know how long that'll take.

Also, don't see how any of the managers you have mentioned are the great.
Klopp without Reus is Brendan without Suarez. He was massively found out earlier this season with Reus out injured and was stuck at the bottom of the Bundesliga (a weaker league). He did well with Dortmund in the past, but to me he seems massively overrated.

Koeman has had one successful season with Southampton (they are actually dropping in quality near the end though) and now he's all that? He's had good runs in smaller leagues abroad but don't think he's any better than BR.

Rafa will always have a place in my heart but he's had his time and we didn't really find much success beyond the first 3 years he was at the club. FSG won't approach him regardless.

de Boer has had little success in Europe - eliminated in the Group Stage for the last 4 years. He's not going to change our european fortunes much at all. He's been good with Ajax but its the Dutch League (60 point separate 1st and last place).

Brendan isn't amazing and he's not world-class but unless we can get our hands on someone like Guardiola, why take the risk?

That said, I'll take a player from a club like Chelsea over a similar player from a small club every time. You shouldn't underestimate the impact of training with world class players on a daily basis. I'm not saying that every big club's misfit is going to be Sturridge in terms of quality, but they're going to be more accustomed to playing at a higher level... A level that we want to see at Liverpool.

I'd love to see us start raiding Europe's biggest clubs for the players that are passed over in favor of the flavor of the week. I'd much, much rather see that than constantly being bent over by midtable domestic clubs for average talent. 

Again, I know it's easy to armchair manage, but I think there are Coutinho-type steals available in every window when clubs with free spending billionaire owners want a new toy.

Again, so are those you list. Rose's caring about people (which was rather discontinuous, actually, I only remember it from *The Unquiet Dead*) can be seen as just a way to move forward the plot of the episode. You can't just dismiss Clara's qualities as ""the story needed it"", because the story is the medium by which we find out these qualities. You could make a case for it if they were ""one-off"" qualities, but if they are recurring they are not functional to the plot, they simply come up and help it.

&gt; There aren't any undisputedly negative qualities about her

What? That may have been true in Series 7, but in Series 8 she is depicted in probably the most negative shades of all NuWho companions bar Adam (who was a one-off anyway). She's a compulsive liar, she thinks she can juggle both lives (ultimately causing Danny's death), she's been picking the worst aspects of the Doctor during her time with him and she's the first companion since Rose in *Father's Day* to openly betray the Doctor's trust. I can't see how someone would think Clara is depicted in a positive way *now*.

&gt;Also, on a side note, I'm less inclined to trust the opinion of that wiki, as it states that Clara and Eleven had hinted at a romantic relationship, which is in no way correct (Yeah, I get the comment that Twelve makes about not being her boyfriend, but that was talking about the time spent together, not a romantic thing).

What if the work dries up? Mortgage companies typically want to see *at least* two years of income history for a self-employed individual, because a couple of months just isn't enough to ascertain if there is a sufficient likelihood of continuation.

And what if you move and then can't afford the mortgage because the work isn't there? You have a young child - repossession isn't something anybody would want.

Why don't you find somewhere to rent in the area you're looking at? That way you can wait until your circumstances are appropriate for borrowing a large amount of money, whilst having the option to leave the area if you decide you don't like it (not such an easy option once you've bought somewhere). You also avoid having to lie to a lender and the potential that you'll be unable to keep up repayments on a mortgage.

null,false,ernestreviews,lfcwfmm,,null,"You seem to have covered a lot of the big stuff, but I'll note down some suggestions for you: 

* *Culturally*: **The Everyman** and **the Playhouse** are two great theatres, check out their schedule if that's your thing. I'd also recommend the **Walker Art Gallery**, **the Bluecoat** which is a sort of cultural hub (extremely central and their garden is a great place to relax with some lunch). **The Philharmonic** does classical music and some extras, **the Echo Arena** does mostly washed up, very famous bands, with some comedy. **Tate Liverpool** on the Albert dock is a must visit. **The Bombed Out Church** at the top of Bold Street is worth visiting just as it's a striking place, but they often have weird and wonderful events. **Leaf** is another cultural hub that does poetry/book readings and smaller scale bands and musicians. You could do worse than walk down **Hope Street**, which must be one of the most striking streets in the UK, with a cathedral at either end, a theatre, a concert hall and an University. 

* *Food*: go down **Bold Street**. There's an incredible array of cuisines there. My current favourites, though this changes regularly are: **East Avenue Bakehouse** the absolute best place for breakfast I've been to, in any city. They do seasonal, local food and bake all their own bread. Their Eggs Benedict is the best I've had, and it's a lovely airy setting. They also do big dinners and sharing plates that I've not had, but I am sure they're excellent. **Cafe Tabac** has been there since the 70s. Does good cheap English breakfast. Gotta try it before you leave.**Maray** is a really good, quite recent tapas place that offers good value for money. **Nolita Cantina** does good sort of American fare. Big, good quality portions for low cost. **Leaf** is a tea emporium, but does pretty good value lunch deals and really lovely sandwiches and cakes. Off Bold Street, **Rococo** in L1 is a bit of a hidden treasure if you need an emergency tea or coffee when shopping, it's above the EE shop. The **Bistro Qui** restaurants are reliable and inexpensive French Bistros, my favourite is **Bistro Pierre** near the Met Quarter. The **Bistro at the Everyman** is a Liverpool institution, though it's not what it once was. There's lot of good places to eat on **Hope Street** though, so have a wander. **Chinatown** does chinese food, obviously. There's a big chinese population in Liverpool and a lot of the stuff is pretty good.

* *Drink*: Liverpool's most interesting scene at the moment is the bar scene if you ask me. **Jenny's** on Fenwick St. is a great cocktail bar with a good whisky selection. Very handy for the town centre and the Docks. It's sort of hidden, but look for a big whisky barrel. **Berry and Rye** another hidden bar just by the Bombed Out Church and Chinatown. Fills up fast, so get there early. Pricey, but my favourite bar in the world. Lovely service and properly good barstaff. **Some Place** is a secret absinthe bar on Bold St. I've not been, but my mates have and they love it. **Aloha** is a Hawaiian/Tiki bar. Bit gimmicky and popular with students, but then, I'm a student. **El Bandito** is the mezcal/tequila bunker. Opens at 9pm and shuts late. **Salt Dog Slim's** styles itself as a dive bar, very popular, a bit expensive and gimmicky but worth a visit. Liverpool also has some of the very best traditional pubs around, my favourites are: **Peter Kavanagh's**, **The Caledonia**, **The Fly in the Loaf** and **The Philarmonic Dining Halls** are incredible, amazing interior- they have the only listed toilets in the UK I think. There's lots of others I'm sure I've forgotten. 

* *Other stuff*: obviously shopping in L1. **Whisky Business** is an incredible whisky shop, next door to Jenny's and run by the same folk. **Lark Lane** has good shops and cafes, but I've never been. **Sefton Park** is a beautiful park with a big palm house. 

Another piece of advice: get an [Independent Liverpool card](http://independent-liverpool.co.uk/). You'll get money off in a lot of the places listed.

null,false,ivc09,null,null,null,"- Brendan is not extremely naive, Not even close. How many different formations did we play last season? How many managers with far more experience did we embarrass? Last season away at United he saw that they had a poor midfield and so decided to play the diamond, we comprehensively beat them that day. Was that extremely naive? Spurs away, everton home, arsenal at home. All days that he proved that he wasn't tactically naive. Even our losses last season against the big teams (chelsea and City away), he proved that he wasn't naive. The performances were good enough to win those games, poor finishing and poor refereeing  cost us. 
 We can take that back to his first season where we were excellent at the Etihad, and should've beaten United at home if not for the ref. On to this season, yes he made mistakes early on, but with no striker available that period was always going to be hard. This nonsense idea that brendan is stubborn is a joke. We went from playing 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 to the diamond and then onto 3-4-2-1. All in the space of 4 months. ""Ancelotti ran circles around brendan"" are you serious? Yes 3 time european cup winner ancelotti leading the defending european champions ran circles around a team with no striker. Did the idea they their  players are just much better never occur to you? You bring up the 09 Bernabeu game, but we played very defensively then too. It was the hallmark of a Rafa away trip In europe. ""That's not what lfc are about"". Oh dear we've parked the bus many many times over the last 15 years. Did you forget away at Juventus and the two ties v chelsea in 05?. Yeah we got knocked out by Besiktas, but is anyone really arsed? City got knocked out in the Europa league 2 seasons ago, United as well. Besiktas aren't extremely shite either btw. They gave arsenal a very good game in August. 

&gt;2. His man management is deeply hit or miss. Yes, he dropped Mignolet and he came back stronger. Yes, he dropped Sakho and he came back to be a key member of the squad. For all of those successes, he plays favourites constantly, has hung Mario out to dry in the media on multiple occasions and hasn't been able to control Sterling. Raheem did what he did but could you envision a player going behind the backs of Ferguson, Mourinho or Wenger like that? I can't. 
 
Haha sorry this part was hilarious. He hang Mario out to dry because he needed a kick up the arse following his dire performances from October-January. Also he's not that great, and doesn't suit our style of play at all. The Mignolet and Sakho situations show he's an excellent man manager, before you bring up Reina and agger, was losing them even that big of a loss? Reina couldn't save anymore and agger could no longer keep up with the demands of English football. All of the current players speak wonders about Brendan, what more do you want? In case you have selective memory, I'm pretty sure Rooney had a very very public contract wrangle under Fergie . Under Wenger,RVP publicly came out and criticised Arsenal's ambition. And Mourinho was a train wreck at madrid for dealing with players. Ramos and Casillias couldn't stand him, it was all over the media. 

- I'm willing to give Brendan a pass on transfers because no one has any clue who is actually signing the players. You conveniently point out the failures, but there's no chance Brendan wanted balo. No one has a 100% success rate with transfers, in fact stats show that the average success rate for transfers in world football is around 40%. Since you think it's Rodgers fault for Lovren and the bad ones I'll point out that under his watch we also brought in Sturridge, Coutinho, Can, Sakho. Your point about him not being a big name is valid, however you can't blame him for that. We got him in the hope that he would make a name for himself, and you can't say that we've not improved under him. We were 8th when he came in, he's got rid of the dead wood and had us back challenging for the champions league in  3 seasons (with one title charge included). 

-Here's where I think sacking rodgers is insane. We all know FSG's policy is to develop youth and play an attacking style of football. That's why they brought in brendan. If you were to sack him, who in world football is 100% better than rodgers at what FSG want a manager to do. Klopp? after this season is he definitely better than Brendan? De Boer? Again he's never managed in a top league so it's extremely hard to know if he's a definite step above rodgers. Koeman? Again is he a 100% better than Brendan? Are we willing to uproot the club (because that's what happens when you bring in someone new) just to bring in a chap who 'might' be slightly better than rodgers? The calls for Rafa are unbelievable. Rafa doesn't fit FSG's strategy in the slightest, it's why they never even considered him in the first place back in 2012. If you want to replace brendan Rodgers then you have to replace him with a better 'brendan Rodgers'. FSG's strategy isn't changing, and there is no one definitely better than Rodgers at doing what FSG wants.

&gt;Whilst I don't particularly disdain Rodgers or anything, he isn't exactly experienced enough to be leading a club like Liverpool. I am all for developing our players, but we shouldn't be in the business of developing a manager.

I'm sorry mate but we are in the business of developing a manager. There's no other choice when you go that long  without champions league. When Brendan came in we were 8th, the other candidates were Martinez and Villas-Boas. We are clearly in the business of developing managers because that's where our level is at. 


&gt;Our last string of wins came from Hendo/Coutinho long distance wonder strikes and solo effort goals. I don't imagine it's part of Rodgers' strategy to be counting on those sorts of goals, so when exactly is his grand plan going to take effect?

Probably when we have a fit striker and a decent back up. The time to truly judge brendan will be next season, if we go backwards he will probably deserve to be sacked. There's been too many variables that were out of his control this season, variables that make it very hard to be able to judge 100% if he deserves to be sacked. Also if we sack him that'll make 5 managers in 5 years, we need stability not constant uprooting.

It's not just the actual viewings, but being available/contactable to do them, fitting them around visitors/other commitments, and keeping the place generally tidy with all your private stuff put away - which you might be doing anyway but isn't a given.

I've heard of substantial discounts on the rent for permitting viewings. After all, you are potentially saving the landlord weeks or months of lost rent if it reduces the gap between having the place let and selling it.

I would propose a certain set of hours each week (some hours on a Saturday plus at least a couple of weeknight evenings) during which I would permit viewings with a certain amount of notice. (I think it's important to set hours because estate agents may well otherwise try to take the piss.) In return I'd want, say, 25% off the rent. (This might sound like a lot but I, personally, really wouldn't like the hassle and intrusion - and I've heard of larger discounts where the landlord wants the place to be tidier for viewings than it otherwise was. If you're not as bothered by it then you might set your price lower.)

I think a fixed monthly amount or percentage of the rent is better because it avoids hassle over counting viewings, and also compensates you for being available for viewings even when there isn't a viewing.

Edit: On first reading didn't realise he wants you to actually conduct the viewings! On that basis I'd definitely go for rather more than you suggest - that would be a bargain price!

The current system is much, much more fucked. I'm on disabilities, the current laws mean I can never own a home, I can never use housing benefit to pay off a mortgage, it can only be used for rent. Or in other words all the money that is distributed for housing benefit and not in social housing immediately goes straight into the pockets of those that own 2 or more homes. This is a self perpetuating bubble, where the rich get richer, buy more houses, demand for rental properties goes even higher and the whole thing starts again.

In Bristol it's currently impossible to find a one bedroom property with wheelchair access that is affordable on housing benefit. I'm about to be evicted as my landlord is putting up their rent by double. I came to bristol as I experienced the same eviction through gentrification and austerity there.

The only area I can definitely afford on benefits is central London, which will cost the tax payer an extra £10k a year (£515 vs £1250). Those with disabilities are currently flocking to central London due to the housing crisis and people like me have started pushing locals out of the area as the amount from benefits is much much more than anyone on a sub £60k salary would ever consider for rent.

I also didn't understand taxes (because I was 21 and stupid) and nobody told me the letters I was getting from HMRC meant I had to do something so I never paid tax on the Uni placement.

They tried to reclaim the £1000 that I owed (for the earnings from the second job) for years but the first full tax year that I was employed was their first opportunity to do so. By the second full tax year I was employed they said I owed £1500 due to that and some other dodgyness with tax codes and a new employer.

Then I started working for the government and they finally sorted it out and paid me back £600.

This is obviously no longer the case, as the previous general election showed.  That was the first coalition since the second world war.  

Just after the last election the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties offered a referendum on a new voting system.  However, since they couldn't agree they picked ['Alternative Vote'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) as the system, something neither party had quite campaigned for.

After a fairly negative campaign and the general disapproval of the proposed choice, it was rejected by around 67% of the population.

So what are the pros of FTPT?

* It's not the Alternative Vote, apparently.

* It's supposed to produce a clear majority in Parliament, so no coalitions.

* It's really really really simple to understand.

Those 650 representatives vote on changes to legislation, etc, so if more than half of them are aligned to a single party and follow the party line, that party can easily pass whatever legislation it wants to enact.  In 2010 no party had a clear majority, so we had what's called a hung Parliament.

Most people seem to vote along party lines, which is why some constituencies gain some truly awful members of Parliament - the voters pay no attention to the person, they vote for the party.  This is why we have what are called ""safe seats"".   Wealthy rural constituencies are usually safe Conservative seats.  Dense industrialised urban areas are usually safe Labour seats.

Anyone can stand in a seat provided they can stump up £500 and some signatures.

You are supposedly voting purely on the candidate. But the party with the most MPs elected becomes the one in power so most people vote on the party rather than the individual.

Sometimes local elections are at the same time as national ones so you can vote for a local councillor too. Not necessarily of the same party as the national one.

The party's themselves decide which candidates will stand I'm each area though their own internal methods which vary per party.

There are a number of seats which are considered 'safe' so anyone who stood there would get elected if they wore the right colour rosette. Sometimes rising talents are parachuted into these. Or they are used by the opposition parties (in that area) to whet new candidates in the election process.

Firstly the phone app was a bit erratic compared to car and truck speedos, they tend to smooth out fluctuations. When on nice flat long empty roads I got some results.  
My car seems to read just under 5% higher than the app, ie 48 on app is 50 on car. Other people on here have said cars shouldn't over read so my first thought was the app was under reading.  
The truck was also over reading the app but by less than 1mph. I have two readouts on my truck, a needle on the dash and a digital one on the tacho (in kph) and at motorway speeds they were consistently &lt;1mph over the app.  

This means my car is reading higher than my truck, I have no modifications to me car, original wheels, basic tyres, etc so I thought from the comments on hear my car would under read.

  
  
Roads...  
Car; A10 and M25, flowing light traffic.   
Truck; M25 at 2am, it was virtually empty so I could try different speeds safely.

Get in touch with C&amp;G, look at their website and find out what you need to do so that you can go on that course.

If your new employees need to wait 1 or 2 years whilst you get these other prerequisites down first before you can even begin taking this course, you're unlikely to get the job.

Having said that, it's probably useful for you to work your way towards achieving this qualification anyway if this is the direction you want to steer your career towards.

**Edit:** It looks like these are qualifications issued based on your experience to prove that you work at a certain standard.  You need to write up your experiences, expertise and skills with evidence (work projects, portfolio, reports and interviews etc.).  So, you don't need specific qualifications other than having a role and responsibilities that are equivalent to the level of qualification.

So, it looks like it's preferable if you already have work experience in this field and can easily get through this or at a push you could try persuading them in your job interview that you will excel at your work and be able to quickly build up enough evidence of your stellar work to achieve this qualification without problems.",null,0,null,1428748680,null,0,1428749677,0,cq8plo4,null,t3_31rqhh,null,t1_cq8plo4,null,t3_31rqhh,null,null,null,1432327804,null,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1,null

&gt;During __British Summer Time__ (__BST__), [civil time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_time) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) is advanced one hour forward of [Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time), so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less.  

&gt;BST begins at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday of March and ends at 01:00 GMT (02:00 BST) on the last Sunday of October. Since 22 October 1995 the times of commencement and cessation of [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) across the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) have been aligned  – for instance [Central European Summer Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time) begins and ends on the same Sundays at exactly the same time (that is, 02:00 [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time), which is 01:00 GMT). Between 1972 and 1995, BST began and ended at 02:00 GMT and not on Easter Sunday. 

&gt;The following table lists recent past and near future starting and ending dates of British Summer Time:

Your statement only maintains correct if you specifically only talk about the SRP and the 50's

Since then there have been no party bans, and the only one in discussion, which has been going on forever, is the NPD, which has been ruled out a lot of times, due to the democratic implications. They operate in a gray area since its quite clear they do not support the fundaments of german democracy and freedom, but still don't have enough evidence stacked against them that warrant a ban.

So no, besides the SRP in the 50's Germany hasn't banned any significant right wing party and that is not how it has been able to keep extreme right wing parties out of the Bundestag. And if you look at the electoin after the SRP ban

This will be a *lot* cheaper than RAC membership and you will re-use them.

Now undo the nut on the underside of the brake lever bracket and remove it. Unscrew the bolt that passes through the brake lever bracket and the brake lever (you can't just pull it out - you need to unscrew it). Pull the old brake lever out.

Holocaust denial is indead illegal in Germany, however if you would follow German politics you would notice most right wing topics tend to stay away from WWII and focus more on ore current issues: Immigration, destruction of values, Lost independence via the EU and so on. The one old one they like is the land Germany lost, but even that is more of a side topic since it again leads toward WWII discussions.


Unlike most other countries, and common belief, Germany is one of the very few countries that has no extreme right wing representation in its Parliament, at least in proportional representation systems. Going by your comment the BNP would have been able to send an MP to London if the system wasn't the first past the post. This is far from happening in Germany, since you need 5% as a small party to be able to get into the Bundestag and the NPD is under 2%.

So no, Germany doesn't ban parties or organizations or others to keep them out of the Bundestag. One of the things I am most proud about of my country is how it has delt with its past and has stepped up to take responsibility for its crimes, a thing that most other countries still have issues with, be it UK with India, France with Algeria or others. You don't get them, because people don't vote for them.


Don't get me wrong, I won't say Germany is free of right wing ideology or that there aren't any people that support it. The difference is, that no movement has or will be able to get support to make it a sizable democratic representation in Germany.",null,0,null,1428750056,null,0,false,0,cq8pvul,null,t3_327tsk,null,t1_cq8pvul,null,t1_cq8prqr,null,null,null,1432327936,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As for the coconut oil stuff, I had a peek at the ingredients and coconut oil is the main ingredient (maybe silly to do, but when there's 'Argan Oil' products on the market that have very little, it's good to check). Other ingredients that jump out to me as 'good' is the aloe vera and vitamin C/E. I don't know if they are a high enough concentration to be effective, however.

I'm not so sure about the olive oil one. It's main ingredient is aloe, and that's also in the face cream. It's possible that your skin really likes aloe vera! You could look into getting some of that (I'd recommend using the search bar here and on /r/skincareaddiction.)

Basically we checked and we had the right to ask them to change the date or time but could not refuse entry completely. The estate agent also had a nasty habit of saying they would just use their own keys to let themselves in if we couldn't be in. We initially asked them to make any viewing for after 3pm weekdays or Saturdays which we didn't feel was unreasonable and that was when someone could be in. However it was rare that any viewing was booked within those times and when we tried to refuse as we couldn't be in in, they said they would just bring the landlord or letting agent with them. We checked our contract and the law and we did NOT have the right to be present for viewings at all so we had to concede and pretty much let then come round whenever they wanted within reason.One visit was rather amusing as it was the morning after a Halloween party with the house all decorated and drunk people passed out all over the living room but we did pre-warn them.",null,0,null,1428750324,null,0,false,0,cq8pxvh,null,t3_3267jb,null,t1_cq8pxvh,null,t1_cq8pr26,null,null,null,1432327964,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

I maintain that in fact that is not the case and the denizens of /r/ukpolitics are victims of sampling bias.

FTFY. It shouldn't take a sign ""MERGE IN TURN"" for drivers to merge in turn... it should be standard practice for someone who is using the road safely and being considerate to other road users.

It's idiotic to form a queue in a lane when the other lane is free. Personally I always attempt to zip merge.

null,false,superfuzzy,blue,North Bristol,null,"&gt; Ahh ok, do you know roughly how much it will cost to join / get onto probation?

Probationary membership doesn't cost anything per se. You pay each time you go. It's not £2 anymore, I believe it's up to £4 that gets you insurance, 15 rounds of ammo and a board to shoot. If you wanna shoot again on that same night it's £3 (since £1 goes for insurance which lasts the whole night).

&gt;I'm just reluctant to drop the £80 on a full membership for something I might not enjoy.

So hence the probationary membership that you just pay for ammo and insurance each time. Then after 6 months you can decide if you wanna join.

&gt;Also do you regularly take new members, or is it more you need to know someone?

Don't need to know anyone, just arrange to turn up with either me or the secretary. However, as mentioned, we are full up at the moment (Home Office regulation sets limits on how many members we can have). Like I said I can let you know as soon as some spots free up, there are some members that I suspect will not be renewing membership, membership fees are due in a month or so.

&gt;And I wouldn't mind trying clay pigeon shooting too, are there any places around Bristol you can recommend for it?

Several. Depends where you are and what you want to do. My two regular ones are [Stockwood](http://www.stockwoodvalegunclub.org.uk/svgc/index.php/) in Keynsham, and [Braces](http://www.bracesofbristol.com/) in Norton Malreward, just south of Knowle.

There are others but I live in North Bristol so getting way down south is a pain in the arse.

The Stockwood shoot is squadded (you have a group that you go round with, and you shoot one at a time and keep score).

The Braces shoot is open, so you just go with whomever you want, push the buttons and control everything yourself, at your own pace.

The Stockwood one is cheaper (£22, or £12 if you have your own ammo). Braces is £17.50 or £27.50 with ammo.

Both have their own merits. Stockwood is a new challenge every time and you can learn from other people, but can be a bit intimidating if you're self conscious. The Braces one being more open I can take my tactical pump action, my automatic and whatever, and just mess about and have fun with it.",null,0,null,1428753826,null,0,false,0,cq8qr75,null,t3_31zf54,null,t1_cq8qr75,null,t1_cq8pf88,null,null,null,1432328347,null,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1,null

Personally I would like to see the ECHR replaced as its too vague... the problem is I don't know who I would trust (if anybody) to do it. It has too many damn exceptions. Example:

&gt;Article 10 – Freedom of expression
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. 
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
2. **The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.**

Highlighting the massive exceptions. In comparison to the US 1st amendment:

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

How I would rewrite Article 10 of the ECHR:

&gt;Article 10 – Freedom of expression 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. 

End.

Capital One's entire business model was to charge high fees to retailers (inflating the price of everything you bought) and then giving part of that charge back to you, while keeping most of it for themselves. You just don't normally realize that 1% of the price you pay for your shopping was for credit card fees, so the 0.5% cash-back felt like you were getting something for free.

They can do a vehicle check, that vehicle check requires the DVLA database to be up to date. As you can also imagine, it isn't the Police who tax cars and so guess what, they have to get that information from the DVLA and once again.... that information has to be up to date.

Well, since it worked quickly for you that must mean it ALWAYS works pretty quickly! A good sample size of 1 gives the most accurate results as always, right?

In response to that, I bought a brand new car a few months back. It didn't show any details on that website for about a month. In fact even the insurers couldn't pull up details through their database.

So a Police Officer, gets told via a vehicle check that the vehicle might not be taxed. The driver tells him the car is taxed as he did it that day.

He doesn't have solid evidence that it isn't taxed, where as previously he could corroborate the vehicle check with the tax disc on the windscreen. Also throwing in the fact that there is a possibility the car may be taxed and the database hasn't been updated.

I'd say... yep that applies to the Police having trouble working out what cars are taxed or not.

An ANPR flashing up doesn't tell you the car isn't taxed, it just tells you it's marked as untaxed. As is the same with insurance, it tells you it's marked as uninsured. 

A driver still gets 7 days to produce a certificate of insurance at a police station of their choice.

Come on buddy, that pretty much is the police having trouble working out what cars are taxed or not. It doesn't apply to all cars but can be quite a few. 

You're just grasping a straws now.

Yes Brown was a part of New labour as every other Labour politician at the time was. 
 But within New labour there were 2 camps. This all goes back to the old labour years, John smith was the last leader of old Labour.
When he died, it was assumed that Gordon Brown was the next most senior and capable Labour politician to take over leadership.

But there was a schism within the party that wanted to rebrand and move to the right, to take the so called 3rd way. But to do so they needed a sympathetic and charismatic leader, Tony Blair was seen as the man to lead New Labour despite Gordons seniority in the pecking order.
A deal was done in Granitas restauraunt whereby Blair would become party leader and become prime minister and Brown would take the role as chancellor and have responsibility for domestic affairs, Blair would also step aside in the future at some point to let Brown take over.

As we all know, Brown fell out spectacularly with the architects of new labour, Mandleson, Blair and Campbell.

If you know about A+ cert already, you probably know about Network+ and Security+, which are certs that focus on other areas, together they give a good basic understanding of how computers and computer systems/networks work.

I have a friend in the position of IT Support who has various Microsoft-specific certifications, earning a decent living wage too. There's a lot of stuff you have to learn beyond these also, but they're good up to a certain point, where you'll be required to learn the software and methods the company you work for uses, but that's more on-the-job training.

Personally I intend to go to Uni for Computer Science or something along those lines. I'm learning/reading about programming and various bits and bobs too (Command line scripting, user/system administration, computer forensics stuff) just for interest's sake.

IT is a massive sector, and you'd be in a good place to transfer to something IT-based within education with your qualifications. Don't squander your degree, it's really quite useful.

Does the warden automatically fine the 'suspect' even though the warden has no evidence that there is no bag, or that a crime or misdemeanour has been committed?

Does this by-law compel a dog owner to produce a bag? If so, then it constitutes a search. It also quite egregiously removes a person's right to not incriminate themselves.

The police are not allowed to search you, or ask you to produce items concealed about your person without reasonable suspicion that an offence has, or might be committed. Why the fuck is this council allowing dog and litter wardens powers that the police themselves do not have.

Effectively, you might (depending on the local legislation) have to show them some of the contents of your pocket to avoid a fine. This very much constitutes a search, even though they haven't literally gone through your pockets.

100 Points:

* Tim takes off his Gilet to reveal an 'Archway Sheet Metal Works PLC' outfit, proceeds to climb up the stands and saw off the Golden Cockerel on the roof, hold it hostage and transform White Hart Lane into one big game of Donkey Kong, where Harry Kane tries to rescue the Cockerel from his grasp. Daniel Levy starts the game by inserting a coin into the mouth of Nabil Bentaleb, only to pull the coin back out again with a piece of string and giggle at his frugal genius. Harry is too fast and is able to dodge all of Tim's barrels of banter. Harry reaches the top, blows Tim Kong away with one big breath and rescues the golden cockerel. Everything goes back to normal, but the universe is permanently altered. Pochettino brings on Kenneth McEvoy, who has completed his transformation into Gareth Bale. Kenneth leads Spurs to 4th place, but on the last day of the season Tim Kong is spotted at the Emirates muttering 'I'll be back...', before beating his Gilet-padded chest furiously and running away to the jungle to transform a group of monkeys into the greatest Premier League team of all time...",null,0,null,1428759005,null,0,1428759646,0,cq8sa0x,null,t3_32888m,null,t1_cq8sa0x,null,t3_32888m,null,null,null,1432329064,null,136,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,136,null

It's only a problem when people approach it with *different* ideas about how it should work.

Moreover, it is more normal and *natural* to queue in single file unless directed to do otherwise. You don't see people on foot autonomously deciding that the queue to enter the theatre, say, would be better served by filling the entire width of the pavement with separate lines. Anyone trying to do that – in *this* country, at least – is generally given short shrift, so why would you expect driving behaviour to be any different?

It should not be difficult at all for a purchase of tax to be entered into the relevant database immediately. And I'm sure dispensation is given to those who say that it has just been taxed (there may be ways of verifying a recent purchase without needing to access ""the database""). Allowing 5 days could be to give breathing room if something does go wrong, but in practice it will be processed much quicker than that

Why wouldn't it be available 24/7. It's a computer system. If it's not available, then the wise thing would be to let it go (tax is ultimately the least worry out of the three - insurance and lack of MOT affect others, tax is really just affecting the government through loss of revenue)

In each of the last four years, the ""total"" for Labour is higher only because of the Short Money (in the Public Funds column), which I explained above...
&gt;As the Short Money is calculated especially to match the Civil Service advantage, you can basically add the same amount as Labour are receiving to the Conservative and Lib Dem budgets as ""hidden money"".

You'll notice in 2009 (when Conservatives were the Opposition), they had more money in their ""Public Funds"" column instead- this is because they were the ones getting the Short Money at that point, whereas Labour were benefiting from the Civil Service support (not counted in those figures).",null,0,null,1428759377,null,0,false,0,cq8senc,null,t3_3249bi,null,t1_cq8senc,null,t1_cq8rqw1,null,null,null,1432329125,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

As far as I am aware, there is no equivalent to the HORT/1 for car tax. Perhaps there is but I've never heard of it nor have I found anything out about it, maybe you can?

The car tax database can take time to update and there is no longer a requirement for a physical display on the car for tax. This can put doubt into the claims that the car is untaxed. The only evidence an officer will really have at hand is there is a marker for an untaxed vehicle but there is also the possibility it has been taxed recently. 

People are often let go because they're unable to get solid evidence. I know a few coppers and this is what they've told me since the paperless change, Ask some yourself.

Edit:

I'm getting bored of juggling back and forth 

Believe what you want, believe that the Police have absolute up to date information on car tax and can act readily on it at all times if you wish. Perhaps also believe that the Police will do you with out solid evidence for an offence as well.

**EDIT** - slight error - except that there was little if any need for subsidy. Councils didn't need to pay mortgages, so their costs were a lot less than the small-scale private landlords that drive rental prices these days.

Admittedly Labour didn't stop the sell-off when they got in power - AFAIK it's still in force now if you can actually find a council house - but by then most of the damage was done anyway. Sure, a lot of ordinary people got to own their own home, for a while, but of course those homes end up in the hands of private landlords at some point. And then those landlords gradually buy each other up as happens in any maturing market until you end up with near-monopoly conditions, with a few landlords owning most of the property.

Also, the get-rich-quick scheme probably isn't so great for small private landlords as it first appears. The lettings agents and buy-to-let mortgage companies grab a big chunk of the profits while the small private landlord takes most of the risk. Mortgage rates go up and rents go down - it won't be the buy-to-let mortgage company that takes the hit.

Don't forget that in the life of a typical building, the duration of a mortgage isn't really that much, so even if all that interest is accepted as a necessary cost of buying a property, in the long run there's really no reason why rents should be as large as - let alone larger that - mortgages. So as larger-scale landlords own properties for longer and longer and buy them without mortgages, it will be trivial to force smaller landlords out of the rental market - just drop rents down to a level where large-scale long-term landlords can still make a profit but small-scale landlords cannot pay their buy-to-let mortgages. It may go against their principles to leave tenants slightly less screwed in the short term, but that way they get to screw the greatest number of people in the long term.

The Tory council house sell-off was never going to achieve it's stated goal, at least not in the long term, and that was pointed out at the time. Of course once it started it was stupid not to grab your short-term slice of the pie by buying your own council house, but now we're all some distance along the road to IMO the real original Tory wet dream - the return of the Victorian slum landlords.

The problems with housing benefit now where even ever-more full-time employed people cannot afford anywhere to live without benefits (so much for unemployed scroungers) were created by the Tory sell-off of council houses that started in the 1980s. Instead of getting a steady income from council house rentals, councils are draining their budgets via private landlords into lettings agents and buy-to-let mortgage companies, and kids who weren't even born when this was enacted are being made the scapegoats.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"Really? This is a list of all of the two parties' announced policies on the subject, courtesy of the BBC Manifesto Watch:  

**Conservatives**:   
* No increase in benefits for working-age people for two years to save £3bn. Affects those receiving jobseekers' allowance, income support, tax credits and child benefit.   
* Cut maximum amount a household can claim each year from £26,000 to £23,000.  
* Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"".  
* 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit.  
* Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds.   
* Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance will once again be protected.  

**Labour**:  
* Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament.    
* Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners.   
* Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.   
* A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes.   
* Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.  
*  Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years.


The whole ""they're all the same"" trope really pisses me off, especially when it comes from people who are actively interested in politics. Of course Labour doesn't want to be the party of keeping people on benefits- no-one does. People who are unemployed but capable of work do not want to stay on benefits- they want to be helped back to work. Every party agrees with this point, Greens included. That's just rhetoric, though; what matters is what you do about it. Every single one of Labour's policy is about giving *better things* to people in order to more effectively help them, with two exceptions- removing the Winter Fuel Allowance from the richest, and capping child benefit rises to 1%. On the contrary, every single Conservative policy on the subject (with the exception of Pensioner things) is either a cut, a removal, or a cap.

I think it's obvious he is staying on Fazio's side as Dier is a quicker player, or allowing build up play to develop on the left of us, and cross over Dier (as the goal shows). 
- Playing deeper places less pressure on Fazio and Dier to play foot-race, brings Bentaleb/Mason deeper and consolidates the centre of the pitch. We're losing that battle right now. Let them drop deeper, and even if Benteke shoots from 25 yards out, Vorm is going to have to show us quality. That's a better alternative than Benteke getting in alone on Vorm.

But even he is very solid technically. Vlad is in this liminal space. He's good on the ball for a defender, but not as good as a midfielder should be. But then he's not that great defensively as he often tries to play like a midfielder from CB, invariably losing possession. If he was more of a physical presence he'd make a good CDM. 

I think with coaching, his best position would be as a conservative RB who is average at defending and attacking (kind of like Ivanivic, he looks like a CB, but is an awesome RB and can actually influence games offensively too).

The credit card companies charge a percentage on each transaction. Passing that cost on to the customer, in the form of an extra fee for paying with a credit card, is extremely unpopular (and forbidden by their contract in some countries; depending on how sympathetic the local legal system is to card company bullshit). Most businesses just end up raising their prices to cover the fees. It acts a lot like an extra 1-1.5% of VAT on almost everything.

The card providers don't need anything like as much money to run the service as they earn in fees, so to gain a competitive advantage over other CC providers, companies like Capital One just give some of the fees back to the customer.

**This means that if I use cash at the checkout, and you pay by credit card in the same shop, I am paying extra to fund your credit card rewards.** That's pretty clearly a rip-off.

(It also gives large chains an advantage over independent businesses, since they can use their superior bargaining power to negotiate lower fees.)

**The EU isn't actually banning credit card rewards.** They are restricting one of the ways that CC providers make money (though most of their income comes from interest). Companies could still provide rewards by cutting profit margins or by raising interest rates - this would be more honest way to do things than the present system of balancing the books with free money they have tricked the public and bullied retailers in to giving them.

Capital One is spinning this as ""big bad EU is taking away your free money"", when it's really more like ""what do you mean, we can't levy a private stealth tax on the whole economy?"".

null,false,Cant-Find-Username,null,null,null,"1) Rangel didn't really do any significant in my eyes. He looks a little bit out of it and Naughton has had a much bigger impact for us. 

2) Hard to say. From the refs point of view, he sees Routledge swing in and take out the man. From the other side it's not so bad. I think it's a foul, had Shelvey not hit it, no one would be questioning it. Also just want to add, there is no way Howard was getting that. Even if he had tried. He acted like he didn't bother because of the whistle but he was clearly out of position. 

3) Lose. Emnes was useless, other than getting the penalty. I like Nelson, is he able to play? I don't think we will be much of an attacking threat without Gomis, so we might have to play for a draw or hope for some long shots from Shelvey and Gylfi, I just don't think we can cross. That being said, I don't see why Ki couldn't play up there? He's fantastic in attack and not a bad target man. 

4) I can't help but like Dyer, but Montero is better and Routledge too. Dyer has age on his side, but when Routledge does start to decline, we'll have more wingers. I think the question is, does Dyer want to be a premier league sub, or a starter at a smaller team. 

5) I don't think he had many choices. No one plans for their main goal scorer to go off early, and it's a shame he was faced with that. I don't think Emnes was on the bench as a tactical replacement. I would've been okay with Oliviera coming on, but Emnes was the right replacement.

To further this, you should avoid using the lawn for a few weeks if you're recently laid down the turf. It needs to root into the ground before it becomes ""stable"". Otherwise you risk damaging it while the grass is still ""weak"".

Until it roots into the ground its water source is just the thin strips of turf on the surface. If those dry out then the grass is getting no water, hence the need to water the grass until it is established (in case you're wondering why).

The thing is, it's not like governments rock up wanting to do that, but by and large you can't control tax revenues, they are a reflection of the health and growth in the economy.  So any proposed solution that doesn't intent to address a lack of growth, is inherently missing the point.

Once growth resumes, consumption tends to follow, as does investment, and you get a feedback loop that steadily increase tax revenues via more VAT and more income tax as unemployment goes down.

If you can cut budgets where appropriate whilst stimulating growth, that's fine.

Apparently only about 3% or so of the track as been built on, a bit of it has been turned into a cycle lane but most of it still survives, including most of the bridges and the tunnels. The big problem will be getting the line into Aber: that part has been built over and there's a big hill in the way, tunneling under it might be the only viable option.

The part from Carmarthen to Llanpumsaint would probably require redirecting the line to follow the A485 since the Gwili Railway owns that part of the track, and the campaign group is quite friendly to them. One advantage to that would be that the journey could be a lot quicker since the original line took a very meandering route following the Gwili river.",null,0,null,1428767847,null,0,1428768174,0,cq8w205,null,t3_328kuj,null,t1_cq8w205,null,t1_cq8vhzr,null,null,null,1432330915,null,7,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,7,null

* Our CMs do too much pointing and not enough owning the ball and playing it. We are desperate for a Verratti, Modric type CM who can boss the game on his own.
* With our CMs being passive and no Jan the build up play was slow and frequently ended up with Vorm who would just kick it up the pitch.
* The crowd really doesn't help getting on players (especially Chiriches') back whenever they do something marginally wrong. Quite disappointing really.
* Eriksen looked laboured and tired today. Especially playing out-wide when he has to do some defensive work as well. I don't understand why don't we just stick it in the nr. 10 role and leave him there.

Gabby again putting in a lot of effort which is massive compared to how he was under Lambert

Delph great again IMO he's really living up to the faith Tim put in him by giving him the armband, That chance at the end really should have been finished though.

Grealish put in another good 65 minutes I think when he really starts getting some experience with the team and in general he will be huge for us, love Tim for looking towards the youngsters.

Bacuna was much better today then Tuesday, he's consistently our most effective assister as of late IMO, if he can keep up on the defense he could be great.

Clark looked a little off again today I hope he's not seriously banged up.

Baker was very solid and so was Vlaar, It's good to have those random runs forward from him again.

Sanchez not horrible

Richardson not as horrible but still pretty bad

**Grealish: 6** - was quiet for much of the game, but handled himself pretty well. made a couple poor decisions in the box, but nothing dire

**Delph: 8** - good control of the midfield. made some key passes and kept possession well

**Cleverley: 6** - typical workhorse game from an improving Cleverley, nothing to moan about

**Sanchez: 4** - poor game from Sanchez. made many poor passes and dumb tackles. if it weren't for the injury crisis, i'd be glad he wasn't playing next game

**Richardson: 5** - got beaten out on the wing multiple times. made a few great tackles, but overall was a hole in the defense

**Vlaar: 8** - brilliant defending the whole game. also put forward some great long balls. this is why we will miss Vlaar after this summer

**Clark: 6** - seemed fine when he was on

**Bacuna: 6** - fine defending. a few bad decisions when going forward

**Guzan: 8** - wonderful goalkeeping. ball distribution was fine this game

**Baker: 7** -great defending with Vlaar

**Cole: 6** - calm presence in the game. made some good passes, but not really a game-changing substitution

null,false,RobinL,null,null,null,"""The research, based on Nationwide’s house price index and rental data from the Office for National Statistics and the property firm LSL, looked at returns for a landlord taking out a 75% loan-to-value mortgage to help finance the investment, so borrowing £3,000 to invest alongside every £1,000 of their own money.""

This highlights and important aspect of property investment: unlike many other assets, it's possible to massively leverage a large investment with little collateral.   It's not really a surprise that if you heavily leverage yourself, and the underlying asset performs well, you'll make a huge return.  If you'd done the same on  the stock market, you'd also have made a huge return.

What's unfair is that the ability to leverage yourself is highly regressive.  To get a mortgage you either need savings (i.e. you need to earn enough to save), or be given money (e.g. have rich parents).  You can then leverage this 'seed finance ' enriching yourself further.

Most importantly, this is basically a case of enriching yourself at the expense of the less well off, because of the controls on housebuilding.

This points to something of a paradox:  to make it more equitable, it appears that we might want to reduce people's ability to leverage themselves against the housing market.  But in doing so, we would make it even more difficult for the less well off to buy their first home.",null,0,null,1428770410,null,0,false,0,cq8xchx,null,t3_3281oz,null,t1_cq8xchx,null,t3_3281oz,null,null,null,1432331523,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

That is all that matters if you want to leave on 8 May - the estate agent can't change that. I would never agree to link your notice period to the estate agent being able to find a new tenant anyway - that is totally outside your control. 

Yes, if that fixed part of the AST ends you move onto a rolling month-by-month tenancy (presuming you pay monthly). Common thing that catches people out though - it is one months' notice to terminate *ending on a rental date*. Example - Your rent is due on first of each month. You give notice on 3rd May, one month later is 3rd June, but the next rental period after that is 1st July so that is the end of the tenancy. People get caught out by that - be careful. 

You can't be forced to give notice or sign up to a new contract. If the landlord wants you out they need to start the eviction process and give you the proper notice in what is called a section 21 notice (as you said this should give you 2 months but usually again ending on a rental date). See this guide by [Shelter](http://www.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/386451/Is_your_section_21_notice_valid_Jan2014.pdf) - also consider giving Shelter a call as they will be fully up to speed on what to do in your situation.

Spurs

&gt;why are so we dreadfully uncreative?


SPURS
&gt;why do we allow teams to pass around our back four like they are not there?


Spurs?
&gt;why must our midfielders be unable to complete basic passes?


Spurs!

&gt;why must eriksen have so many off days?


Spurs... but more likely some burnout, and the fact that there is nobody to replace him when he is having an off day.

&gt;why must rose be our most threatening attacker?


Spurs. Also because left-back now has competition in the form of Davies, so Rose has to earn his place week in week out. Davies is a perfectly competent replacement and unless Rose nails his place each week it can and will be taken. Look at everyone else. Kane underperforms... Who do you want to replace him? Soldado(whom I'm love but can't score, or Adebayor who would probably just piss around for 90 mins). Who do you realistically replace Mason/Bentaleb with, etc.

&gt;what is the missing link?


Honestly, not much. But some of the rot has to be cut out. There appears to be a contingent of players who are happy to turn up and collect their wages and provide no competition to places in the team. Mason and Bentaleb for all intents and purposes have no competition. Chadli/Lamella/Townsend... thats a 66% chance at playing no matter how poor your are in the previous game or in training. Kane and Eriksen could spend training punching each other in the face for a laugh and still be the first two on the team sheet. Rose is the only player with honest-to-goodness actual competition. As state above Davies is a viable replacement who performs well. Rose is also THE MAN at the minute.

The horrendous sad fact of this entire thing is, if we don't sort it soon, the cycle will repeat. These players will end up Jaded, and will just give up their places to ""new blood"" while they sit back and collect their pay regardless.

Imagine if your start a new job, and are told that the Employee of the month gets double pay. Now imagine that your competition is a guy who sits around the office all day flicking elastic bands at people, and wanking in the toilet. All you have to do to get that sweet bonus is like 15 minutes of work.

&gt;Dear Caroline Lucas

&gt;I'm an 18 year old living in Brighton, starting to think about voting next year. I've been reading a lot of Labour/Green policies lately trying to work out who to vote for. Anyway I'm a guy who cares a lot about men's issues and a few of your policies massively concerned me in this regard (considering that I'm looking for a party which is going to be really strong on these issues). I'm talking specifically about Criminal Justice 381 through 383. 

&gt;Unfortunatly there is a massive double standard when it comes to crime in this country (and around the world) in which men are held to much higher standards, and often get far harsher sentences for the same crimes as women (i have no doubt you're aware of this). I feel that these policies imply that you want to widen this gap instead of closing it, which greatly concerns me. I was wondering what you had to say about this issue? 

&gt;Some particular points in regards to the sexism here:

&gt;""women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments.""

&gt;The gender roles in our society that say women should be caregivers and housewives are false and damaging. I feel that police CJ382 ignores this problem, and instead enforces the gender roles. 

&gt;""with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence""

&gt;You may also note that 90% of all prisoners (forgetting sex/gender) have at least one mental health condition. It is also a fact that, for a male, being sexually abused as a child significantly increases the likelyhood of becoming sexually abuse against children.These things (at least definitely the latter) are not used as excuses, so I'm confused as to why the Green party feels it should be different for women.

&gt;I'm aware you're pretty busy so don't worry if it takes a while to get back to me. There were some other things but this email got a bit long. 

&gt;Thanks


**and then she wrote to me**:

&gt;Dear Owen,
 
&gt;Thank you for writing to me and my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but the last few weeks have been very busy.
 
&gt;You raise some really important points and I’ve previously worked closely with organisations like the Howards League and Prison Reform Trust to tackle equality and rights within our criminal justice system. I am not personally aware of evidence that men systematically get stricter sentences than women for the same crimes and would be very interested in anything you can sign post me to that would allow me to find out more.
 
&gt;In fact, much of the evidence I have read points in the other direction. Justice for Women, for example, highlight the contrast between the treatment of Brian Steadman, jailed for just three years in 1995 for killing his wife by hitting her 13 times with a hammer after pleading diminished responsibility because his wife constantly nagged him, and that of Zoorah Shah who had experienced 20 years of sexual and physical violence from her partner - who then began to abuse her eldest daughter - and was given 20 years for his murder.
 
&gt;There is gender inequality in this country. When it comes to pay, representation in parliament and in the boardroom, and many other areas, it’s women who are currently less equal. My Party’s policies seek to close that gap and take us towards genuine equality. When it’s men who are losing out, we want that to be addressed too.
 
&gt;You mention our policies on childcare and it’s a good point that the wording might better reflect that everyone should be engaged in such tasks. That said, it’s still predominantly women who bear domestic and childcare responsibilities.
 
&gt;On CJ381, I think there is a difference between those with mental illness and those who have suffered abuse. The reason that in some instances mental illness is used to argue diminished responsibility is because sufferers have no control over what they are doing – they cannot be held responsible. That applies to both men and women.
 
&gt;In abuse cases though, the fact of having been abused does not automatically in itself absolve you of responsibility or mean you have lost control over your actions. In some cases that may be true – in which case I’d suggest there’s a mental illness there – but it’s not a given. Again, that applies to both men and women. So I don’t think you are comparing like with like.
 
&gt;I would agree though that CJ381 could make clearer that men with mental illness should receive the same treatment as women, and that the same principles about custody should apply.  CJ381 is a refinement of the broader policies spelt out elsewhere, which make clear that we think custodial sentences should be used more sparingly in general.
 
&gt;I hope that’s helpful and thank you for your interest. I appreciate your patience in waiting for a reply and hope you have a happy Christmas.
 
&gt;Best wishes, Caroline

null,false,rojozorro,dundeeutd,,null,"Scottish Football Association chiefs may have scored a spectacular World Cup own goal by agreeing to play Qatar in a friendly.

Scotland will face the Gulf nation at Easter Road in June before they face Ireland in a crucial Euro 2016 encounter in Dublin.

But by facing Qatar, Scotland may have shot themselves in the foot when it comes to the World Cup 2018 qualifying draw in Russia in July.

Scotland are currently on the brink of securing the last place in Pot Two of seeds, which would be a huge boost for Gordon Strachan's side.

However, because of the complicated way FIFA's World Rankings work, by agreeing to face Qatar - a nation currently ranked 99th by world football's governing body, even a win against the oil-rich country could work against Scotland when it comes to Rankings points because of both their lowly position and being a member of the Asian Football Confederation, which isn't ranked as highly as UEFA nations.

And it would mean Scotland sliding into Pot Three for the July 25 draw, which will be held in Konstantinovsky Palace in St Petersburg.

If Scotland had decided not to take the fixture against Qatar - a country where an SFA delegation of chief executive Stewart Regan, president Campbell Ogilvie and vice-president Rod Petrie visited on a fact-finding mission in February - they would have known that a victory over Ireland in the Aviva Stadium would have guaranteed them a Pot Two place.

The rankings are based on the last four years' results, with results in the past 12 months counting for more than those in the preceding years and points are averaged out according to the number of matches played in a year.

It would mean that even a win over Qatar would affect Scotland's average points in the Rankings because of the relatively low points a win would collect. A draw or defeat to the World Cup 2022 hosts in Edinburgh would end all hopes of that Pot Two place.

Respected football statistical prediction site We Global Football summed up the SFA's decision to play the friendly against Qatar by commenting: **""While Scotland has been doing OK in qualifying, they've completely screwed the pooch when it comes to scheduling.**

""Arranging a friendly with Qatar will only hurt them further. They had a chance to get into Pot 2, but they've failed to do the things necessary to get there. Even still, if they win at Ireland and didn't play Qatar, they should have been able to get in.""

FIFA will use their Rankings for July 2015 to decide seeds. Pots will be split into nine teams per pot, apart for smaller pots near the bottom end of the seeding.

The SFA declined to comment on the matter last night.

-Eriksen has quitely done a Cesc on us, and disappeared since the end of January. With Chadli playing bad too, Kane is basically our only serious threat on goal. Danny Rose was actually our second best attacking player.

-Kane was good, but he can't do anything alone, and he's a bit too selfish at times. Bentaleb and Rose were decent too.

-The players all look very tired, which makes sense because of the pressing game and very little rotation. They didn't look like they believed 4th is possible.

-We completely lack depth, Chichires and Fazio were average. Our attacking midfield options are quite bad as well, particularly when Eriksen is playing badly. Lamela is dissapointing.

-Mason gets way too many credit. Wouldn't mind seeind Dembele at CM occasionaly.

-There's a lot of hope for next year but goddamn, we must get our transfers dealing in the summer right.

It is quite clear that the Lib Dems and conservatives negotiated hard over the policies that each other would help push through, and tuition fees turned out to be one of the policies the Lib Dems gave up in order to get more of their front page manifesto policies through. Tuition fees wasn't even a primary policy for them and the current implementation is a far cry from the unlimited cap that the conservatives really wanted. The Lib Dems didn't simply turn face, both parties had to give up some of their policies in the coalition and it turns out that keeping tuition fees at the same rate just wasn't worth it, especially since it really doesn't cause any further issues to today's students, despite the rhetoric about it.

Mortgage borrowing is one of the primary ways money is created in the UK. If house prices fall and the money supply cannot continue to grow at a faster and faster rate the monetary system will collapse. 

The political parties have no choice but to prop up house prices unless they want to change the way money is created. That is why there is so little (economically speaking) that separates the three main political parties. Allow house prices to fall and we are in a world of hurt.

&gt;whether any measures other than mansion tax would be introduced that could hurt house prices

A mansion tax wouldn't really reduce house prices as they are propped up from the bottom with Help-to-Buy and banks lending at 5x joint income with a 5% deposit.

&gt; at what point does ""generation rent"" vote becomes relevant enough for the government to actively try and stimulate gentle and gradual cooling off of the house market?

Political parties will just waffle on about building more houses and that will satisfy those floating voters for the moment.

It doesn't have to be explicitly stated in the Convention itself as long as it's well known that that's how the Convention will be interpreted by the Court.

Plus, you highlighted the part of the text that allows the rights to be balanced against each other:

&gt;may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society [...] for the protection of the [...] rights of others

This is backed up by Article 17:

&gt;Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.

If person A has an Article 8 right then person B's article 10 right may be restricted by that Art. 8 right and vice-versa.

You think the only time anyone would point out the fact that a headline has been worded in a particular way to mislead or be biased is pushing an agenda? Really?

&gt;People are paying 50% of there earnings just on rent, we have people (professionals being forced onto the streets), its affecting the economy because people have less money to spend and thereby their quality of life. Even the CBI released a report on the issue, below. 

I'm not disputing this. I'm pointing out that the average rental yield on an investment property is 5%, which is a lot less sensationalist than 1,400%. 

A property worth £250k will typically let for about £1k a month (depending on where you are, but generally this is the case). If you want to say that property prices are too high, then I'll agree with you. Quick maths quiz: What percentage is 12,000 out of 250,000?

But that doesn't change the fact that 5% is the expected yield on a rental property, does it.

&gt;The reason you got downvoted was because you're trying to use that one metric to justify landlords behaviours.

Sorry, where did I say something was justified? Where does stating the **fact** that expected rental yields are 5% automatically justify anything? The reason I got down-voted is because the echo-chamber in here says landlords are evil (which I won't dispute), and I pointed out the actual real-world rental yield rather than agreeing with the shocktastic 1,400% figure.

null,false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"Young people are vastly in favour of the EU and digital rights. Young people favour drug liberalisation and care about the environment at a much higher rate than the older voters. These are all Lib Dem policies and most of them have been pushed while they've been in power. The Conservatives and Labour do not and have never represented young people. The conservatives party is all about destroying an open internet, continuing our failed drug policies and censoring anyone they can including whistleblowers and responsible consumers of pornography. They are socially backward and authoritarian with a very aggressive, almost religious kind of universal morality that punishes the individual and rewards the naive and conformist hive mind.  

Labour have pretty much bankrupted this country every single time they have been in power since 1945. The full scale of the unfunded liabilities especially after Blair and Brown is catastrophic to the point where young people today should be expecting to be abandoned by the government in future because the money will all have been paid out to current pensioners and welfare recipients (the former of which by the way the Tories have made worse). Niall Ferguson has said of American young people that if they knew what was good for them they should vote as far-right as possible. Admittedly he is himself a rather blind Conservative but his point that unfunded future liabilities just moves the repercussions of irresponsible borrowing onto a generation of people who never voted for it is perfectly valid. 

Young people are by and large fiscally conservative and socially radical. Neither Labour or the Tories actually provide that. They work for the established organisations alone, whether it be anti-consumer and anti-competitive trade unions or big banks and wealthy individuals. Neither party gives a shit about individual rights, evidence based policy or internationalism. They're ultimately just serving their own parochial establishments and powerful supporters none of whom are young and ALL of whom stand to gain from the exploitation of young working people whether it's by paying them less or by preventing their own displacement in the workforce. 

I will probably vote for the Lib Dems because they say things I agree with and tactical voting is betraying your integrity in way way I don't like. Even if I didn't like what they said I would never vote for the main two parties and young people certainly shouldn't. The main two parties actively work against the interests of young people and always have.

You can never be evicted without a court order regardless of the status of your tenancy. And even the fastest court process takes a number of weeks. 

You are likely making the right decision by leaving. If you want to report it, the police are unlikely to be useful or very interested. I would suggest contacting the tenancy relations department of your local council ( find your council here: https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council )

Really felt for Pelle. He's always trying and trying and trying, really directing the team, but after that yellow his head just dropped, however he did pick it back up and started to win aerial balls. Really chuffed he got his goal, he's been so deserving and in our poor games has been one of our better players, he contributes more to the team then just goals, which is what a lot of people dint understand, after his goal he was full of confidence, even produced a fake pass which was hilarious. At the end of the game, he was waving to the crowd and tapping the crest, thought that was really special from someone who hasnt even been here a season.

And JWP FINALLY scores. So chuffed for him, he looked so delighted, I really hope its the first of many. [LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0xLGsj_WA)

Spurs loss was a big boost to, although worrying as we still have Villa to play. Hopefully they keep out of form, and Livershite have another poor game Monday, I'll take the draw.

COYR.

As a side note, our fans may not be the loudest, largest or most passionate, but I'd imagine the number of fans from other clubs who would have stuck by Pelle for as long as we have, to be very few. The support for him has been incredible.

 [**Great Recession**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Recession): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Great Recession__ was the general economic decline observed in world markets around the end of the [first decade of the 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade\)). The exact scale and timing of the recession is debated and varied from country to country.   In terms of overall impact, the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund) concluded that it was the worst global recession since [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).   According to the U.S. [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research) (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the U.S. recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, and thus extended over 19 months.  The Great Recession was related to the U.S. [financial crisis of 2007–08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) and [subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–09](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis).

&gt;Since switching to centre forward from the wing, Bertrand Traore has 10 goals \+ 3 assists in 13 games \+ Vitesse is W10 D3 L0. Smart move.

You can get paid while sitting on the bench and that's not helping him in any way to fulfill his potential.

He has far too many weaknesses and too few strengths in his game at the moment. His decision making is just awful at times. 

Sterling hasn't experienced bad times. He was in and out of the team during last season's first half but that's about it. Coutinho has also huge potential but he has his head screwed onto him. He knows how bad it is to go somewhere with great expectations but then fall out of favour. It's the most crucial time for young footballers. Getting gametime, experience. Sterling has it all at Liverpool. 

&gt; He has the potential to be world class and unfortunately, he knows it, and wants to be paid like he is world class right now.

The passing wide all the time is bollocks.
The 'inverted wingers' doesn't work unless they move in to support.
As they don't we end up isolated up front with our one man. (Today when sakho had nothing on, had to shoot from 40 yards because of this) 
Trying to defend a 1-0 lead by parking the bus regardless of time is wrong.
The hoofing the ball obviously down the right from kick off is stupid too while I'm at it, noble to Collins hoof, lose possession + 5 men out of position, it's never worked. Fat sam doesn't learn from it. 
The counter attacking system bores the hell out of me, we are always the team trying to break with 1 vs 10: sakho again today. Did brilliant getting past 3 in the first half. No one to cross so had to shoot and almost went off for a throw.
The subs are bizarre. The stubbornness to not play nene is a joke. It's these sort of things why he has to go. 

We have had a good season but the drop has been since the return of Nolan from injury. And Allardyce is at fault for everything since. If he had maintained what was working we would have carried on so well. As soon as his bum chum is back that's it, Nolan back to ruin everything. The blokes heads gone, he's so far up his own arse it's unbelievable. And the excuses after every game are ridiculous. 

His defence of losing being a consequence of entertaining football is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. This week he said it's a performance business in his defence to Sullivan's disappointment. But think back to us booing and him cupping his ear vs hull last year. Thought it was a performance business. He's done what he can do at west ham now. He needed to guide us. We had the players, the investment needed to get back where we are but now it's time to take the club forward by parting ways with him. 

I only see rafa as the man who can do that. Fingers crossed.

Rant over. Roger's Johnson... Over and out.

Tldr: Allardyce philosophy is wrong, he's at fault for the turn in our season. The chairmen have done a brilliant job since we went down.

null,false,muffinmenace,blue,Lesser Spotted Tory,null,"My term for moving council tenants on is in reference to Council / HA housing (or all welfare) being there only as a safety net and once the person(s) have stabilised their life they can then move on with no government help. By having the permanent subsidy it stagnates the social property chain and in turn helps company to pay lower wages (and tax) because the workers don't need a higher wage for housing (or living costs in general / working tax credits). As you can see it's a self perpetuation problem that will only ever get worse until there's a sustainable model that doesn't keep costing the tax payer money.

Another factor that must be considered is the population increase of 2.5 million since 2001 - this is a vast amount of people for a country already in turmoil for property development because of NIMBYism. Hopefully actions by successive governments to move industry and trade away from the SE can improve the prospect for the UK as a whole and bring a balance to house prices. 

Gentrification is a way of Western society, and if you really want to see how good we have it look at China or India and their caste systems. People have no right to live where they want, they have to live where they can afford and that applies to both the private and social tenants, I'd love to live in Wapping, but I can't.

I don't see why you should be able to use benefits for paying off a mortgage, this has never been the case and there's a very good reason why this is in place. I know of Support for Mortgage Interest payments depending on how you qualify but if you can't afford to live where you want then you will have to move. The reason this is happening is not because of a single decision or policy but generations of systemic mismanagement of how the government  provides for those in need. I dispute that landlords are inherently greedy or evil you have no basis in which to reference this, their costs are hidden and they can only ever charge what the market will pay.

There's a couple of Armstrongs mentioned in it but it doesn't look like either is your man. 

A census was taken in Britain in 1901 and another in 1911. You can look at census results on this page: http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?401, although I think there's a fee. 

You could have a look and see if there's a T. Armstrong living in Cowdenbeath in 1901 or 1911, although there are likely to be several, but I think the census form gives occupations.

Charlie is a playmaking midfielder with great vision. Although pretty good with both feet, he's often described by Ben of Chelsea TV as having a ""wand"" of a left foot. With the ball at said-feet he plays very similarly to Josh McEachran. He can play perfect long-balls to feet or chest, cross-field balls or intricate short passes. He loves to keep the tempo going and rarely loses the ball carelessly. It's worth noting the high quality of his set-piece delivery - direct free-kicks, indirect free-kicks and corners - he is consistent and dangerous. In line with Chelsea's philosophy, he has good experience in the 6, 8 and 10 positions.

Charlie's challenge is his physical stature. Like Josh, he faces a struggle to make it in the Premier League due to the average strength and size of the opponents. However, he is not afraid to put in a challenge and mix it up with the big boys. He will actively close down opponents and make life difficult for anyone near by. He has an aggressive streak which I do like to see.

Overall, I think he's a classy player and I would love him to make it at the club. However, I believe due to his lack of size and strength he faces an uphill battle.

null,false,TjBee,null,null,null,"I went to the game today and here's a few thoughts...  

HOOPER YOU FRUSTRATING MAGNIFICENT BASTARD. He seems lazy and sloppy with his passing and then pulls a wonderful lob out of the bag. I have since lost my voice and was jumping on a knee I had surgery on about 3 weeks ago but what can you do eh, the doctor will understand.  

Now back to the start of the game... For the first 15 we we're all over them and I thought I was in for a pleasant April afternoon. Dorrans got the goal, and although it was a fortunate defection we deserved to be ahead, and really should have put the game to bed..  

Then with their first real chance of the game, Whittaker (who wasn't great defensively today) gets beaten and LeFondre scores a good finish from a great cross. Then for the rest of the half they were the better team. Olsson saving a goal with an important header not long after the goal.  

Second half was pretty even until about 60 minutes where Redmond and Hoolahan, who had looked promising early on but had began to slow the game down, went off for Grabban and Hooper and suddenly we had all our strikers on the pitch.  

Then we were doing the pressing and Bolton players were getting booked for time wasting. I'm at my angriest when the opposition keeper is time waiting near where I'm sat. They were coming close too, Bassong headed one off the line.  

Then with barely any time left, it gets hoofed up, Jerome did what he'd done so well all game and headed it on, then Hooper was through and the keeper came out. The Lob hadn't touched the floor until it crossed the line. It was a close one. But boy were they pumped. Particularly Russell Martin and interestingly Bassong. Full time as well they were the most enthusiastic. Nice to see him excited with the team and the fans after all the shenanigans with Neyul Mk. 1.  

Dorrans was MOTM for me. Got his goal but once again bossed the midfielder. A real Box to Box guy which we've missed since Leroy left. Breaks up play so well while also providing some quick passing around the box.  

Bring on Tuesday, we really need a BIG win to ease the goal difference, particularly with Watford's easier run in.

I don't think people are aware of how much of an impact expensive trains have. Currently if you are working in London, you could easily commute from within 50 miles and it would probably take you just as long as a commute from Zone 3 to Liverpool St or something. However, no one will do this, because the money you save from living outside of London is so nominal because of your extortionate season ticket that you may as well just live in London. Sure, you might save £20, but it's not really worth it is it when you could live in a vibrant city?

More affordable ways of getting into London would boost economic growth outside of it and decrease demand for housing within London. I know I'd consider commuting even from Birmingham - but why would I when it's £50 return in advance?!

I don't know a solution to creating more jobs outside of London, but I know one that can help fix the housing problem. It's very simple, barring contract issues!

null,false,oiyfd,null,null,null,"A capitalist(ish) solution:

Rather than rent controls or legal restrictions on prices, who owns what etc.. Why not tax differently: if there was an iterative increase in tax for each subsequent property owned (2nd  pays higher rate of tax than 1st, 3rd pays higher rate of tax than 2nd, 4th than 3rd etc etc). 

This would create a situation where:

i)  Landlords who own lots of properties would have to more efficient in order to make a profit than those who own less (spending less whilst keeping properties at a standard able to attact tenants willing pay higher than average rent).

ii)  People using property simply as way of storing wealth (rather than as a home), would see a greater rate of return elsewhere (stocks, shares, bonds etc..), meaning that first time buyers looking for a home would no longer be in competition with fund managers looking to manage the billion pound portfolios of the super rich.

One of the major drivers of this never ending increase in house prices is that rent prices go up with property prices (if we conveniently forget oscillations caused by speculation) because everyone needs a roof over their heads so we pay rent or get a morgage.  A landlord 20 years ago with 5 houses would have to wait pretty much the same amount of time to buy their 6th with the rent recieved from the others as they would today.  As competition between landlords bidding for new buildings drives up house prices, rents go up.  With this extra rent recieved there is more money available when bidding for properties so prices increase even more.  This is how the lowest rung on the propery ladder became pretty much unattainable and also why the housing market became regarded as a safe place to store your assets (prices always go up).",null,0,null,1428779835,null,0,false,0,cq929cy,null,t3_3281oz,null,t1_cq929cy,null,t1_cq8rp6p,null,null,null,1432333910,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; Many many young people are paying over half their pay check each week to simply not die in the streets. Highly immoral. 

While your statement is true, it is also very one sided, there are massive issues with rent prices and/or ridiculous commute lengths in the south, but go up north and you will be paying 25-50% less while only getting paid 10-20% less in pay for the same job. 

The problem is not essentially rent, the problem is the lack of diversification of industry and commerce across the country, if everyone didn't want/need to live in the south east to get a job then house/rent prices wouldn't be so absurd. 

There are plenty of non-cities up north that have been shrinking for years all because of the lack of investment in them, both in infrastructure and jobs, places like Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle are doing fine, but a lot of other northern towns and cities are hardly prosperous (in terms of money circulation) compare to the London commuter belt. 

If you take the German model as a far better example, both given its relative protection from the recession and diversification, the UK has London, the top rated city in the world with NYC, to find the next city in the UK you have to go down 5 categories to find Manchester. There are 5 or 6 German cities between London and Manchester, The UK has an Alpha++ city, a Beta city, and 2 Beta- cities ([As can be seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city#Global_Cities_Index)), Germany has an Alpha, an Alpha-, Two Beta+ cities, a Beta and a Beta-.

In my city the train gets colleagues from several neighbouring towns and villages into the city centre faster than other colleagues can bus it from what you'd still call ""central"" in the city. But the train fares are very expensive (even though you're probably standing) because the train company needs to rake in rush hour profit to subsidise off peak. 

For government however, train usage cuts road costs and city centre housing pressure, etc. Government can lose money on trains and still come out ahead.

The point of private companies is free market and competition, where does that happen when every journey is on a monopoly controlled line? OK for carriages, whatever, this is the customer end and maybe being private offers potential customer service benefits and lower risk of sympathy strikes.

They voted against Scottish Labour's proposed amendment to the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill, on the grounds that what Scottish Labour was proposing (making it mandatory for companies that receive public sector contracts to pay the Living Wage) was [forbidden by EU law](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/msps-vote-down-living-wage-plan.1399993787).

&gt; while at the same time championing cuts to corporation tax.

I believe they abandoned that policy when Sturgeon took over (the old policy being to cut corporation tax after independence to -3% (ish) of the UK rate). Within the UK, Labour are currently proposing to increase it from 20% to 21% - having cut it from 33% to 28% previously.

&gt; They've cut health and education spending in Scotland, despite increased funding.

NHS Scotland's budget will [increase by £380m](http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Health-budget-increases-14c3.aspx).

As far as I can see education spending [has also increased overall](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/10/2706/11). The Scottish Funding Council funding has decreased by £5.4m due to a two-year funding programme concluding, which prompted some [newspaper stories](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11455882/Scottish-universities-research-funding-cut-by-13-million.html), however to put it in context that's 0.3% of their overall budget.

&gt; And if Sturgeon is so keen on people getting into university on ""their ability to learn not their ability to pay"" why did the SNP MPs vote for higher tuition fees in England and Wales (something both Bennett and Wood conveniently forgot about at the debates).

As far as I can see, all six SNP MPs [voted against](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/09/tuition-fees-higher-education) higher tuition fees.",null,0,null,1428783217,null,0,false,0,cq940mq,null,t3_324nr0,null,t1_cq940mq,null,t1_cq8xu90,null,null,null,1432334738,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Whilst I see the benefits for everyone the rules are far from refined. E.g. we now have to fit a trade plate to every car a customer wants to test drive because 'no tax'. A trade plate is relatively expensive so we only have 2. So what do we do on weekends when there are 3 customers wanting a test drive? Also, it used to be a blessing if you could get a car with 6 months+ tax still on it, the car was much more sellable.

In property yields look low (like 1-4%) because a large amount of the capital has to be invested to make any return at all... shares for example work different, and relatively small amounts can still achieve the same yields as larger ones - So £100 might yield £105 after 12 months, and £1000 would yield £1050.

What this study does is assume a person bought a single BTL property in 96', paid off their own ""average"" mortgage and then once it was paid down they kept all the returns. That of course is what many of them did. The study does actually go on to point out that if they didn't keep the returns, but re-invested them into more BTL properties then they could actually grow the yield to nearly 3000%. 

The point of the study was that BTL has made a group of very ""average"" landowners **immensely** wealthy in just 20 years, requiring relatively little day to day effort.

I think the study does stand, along with the others, as further proof that BTL has been under-regulated, massively under-taxed and hugely costly for the generation it has locked out of property ownership.",null,0,null,1428783707,null,0,false,0,cq949gi,null,t3_3281oz,null,t1_cq949gi,null,t1_cq8utco,null,null,null,1432334854,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The abuse was of a few by a few, I'm not suggesting that it was in any way right.

The Rotherham, and other, events are more about dogma and the manipulation of events and facts to match the dogma. The Labour officials decided the means justified the ends. Consequently the abuse of thousands by thousands was tolerated. And to what end was the abuse tolerated? Certainly is was not to hold on to power, these are the sort of places where a gibbon would be elected, just so long as it sported a red rosette (see Austin Mitchell's comments on Grimsby). No, the abuse of thousands was tolerated so members of a branch of the Labour party could avoid the embarrassment of possible accusations of racism. 

I don't condone either but for me the latter caused more a great deal more suffering for a far pettier reason.

'I've seen him head a corner away from our 18-yard box and finish up in the opposition penalty area scoring a goal, at 18 he's already become one of our main men in the team, and we all know it.

'In our home game against Swindon, we were losing 1-0 until Del whipped in an equaliser and we ended up winning. He has dug us out so many times, I've seen a lot of young players hit the ground running and then hit a brick wall. But Del is happy to take responsibility,' said Martin.

'I think we all look around before kick off, see Del in the middle and think we'll be alright. Even against Manchester United, he looked so comfortable in that company. And doing a pre-season with Spurs will make him even better with better players around him. It wouldn't surprise me if he is in their team this time next year.'

I think a lib-lab coalition is the most likely scenario. Labour could threaten the Lib Dems with a left-wing SNP coalition and the lib dems would be forced to move the government to the center. If the Lib Dems stayed with the Tories, then they'd essentially be saying that they are Tory light and they don't care about the fact that the majority of people are more left wing than right wing but get screwed over by FPTP. Also, it's probably the best way to get a government that supports civil liberties--this is one of the selling points of the Lib Dems and Ed Miliband was an opponent of ID cards at the time.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I agree, the solution will have to be multi-layered;

* More houses need to be built.
* BTL needs to be massively restricted to prevent those new houses simply being snapped up by would-be landlords, especially in view of the recent pension changes where many pensioners will be looking to plough their pensions into property. 
* A rental cap needs to be introduced to contain rises and to prevent abuses. 
* The rental market needs drastic reform to make renting more like owning... for example a legislated tenancy contract that prevents landlords evicting tenants in all but the most stringent conditions (i.e. major damage to the property or failure to pay).
* The minimum rental contract period should be 5 years for the landlord. The tenant should be able to give the landlord ~2-3 months notice if they wish to leave. This will help make property more secure for people raising children (not having to drag them out of school every 6-12 months when they move house so landlords can hike up their prices). 
* It should be made illegal for landlords to prohibit certain practices - i.e. owning pets, putting up shelves, repainting. The only condition would be that the tenant has to return the property in a similar condition to which they received it... so they can paint the walls fluorescent pink if they want, but they'll have to paint it back when they leave. 
* The lending conditions for BTL should be heavily restricted, so BTL landlords need to front most of the capital for the property - rather than lending from the bank. That would help free up lending capacity for first time buyers rather than BTL landlords. 
* All landlords should have to pay to join a compulsory register. The regulating body that runs the register would have the power to ""strike-off"" landlords (and legally bar them from renting residential or commercial property). Renting property without being registered would be a criminal offense punishable with a significant custodial sentence. Certain crimes would automatically result in a bar from renting property (for example being on the sex offenders register or being convicted of fraud).
* BTL should be taxed much more aggressively to cut the yields.
* Urban areas need to be identified and bought up by the state as part of a land re-generation project. There are lots of cities (Southampton, Reading and Slough are a few good examples that spring to mind) that desperately need inner city land - but the land they have is taken up with sprawling, inefficient and poorly made 2-story post-war council houses. Those sites need to be bought up with compulsory purchases to make way for newer, more space-efficient ~10+ story US-style apartment buildings. There's no point building 5000 homes on the greenbelt, we need 300,000+ homes a year over the next few years... and realistically the only way that will happen is to build cities upwards rather than outwards. 
* Restrictions need to be placed on what existing residents can oppose to - to prevent NIMBYism. The entire onus of the planning permission process should move away from *""can we build this""* to a system of *""We are definitely going to build this like it or not... BUT, are there any modifications that would make it more acceptable to existing residents?""*
