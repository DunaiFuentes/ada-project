Your interest rates fell over the long-term quite  dramatically making your payments even cheaper. 
Your deposit was far  smaller, average wages in 89 were around 18k so a ,60k house would have been the average price around then going by lending restrictions to 3x wages.
Buying in the trough of 96 meant housing even cheaper and deposits even smaller set against falling interest rates and decent pay inflation ( compared to today) 
Buying was a much easier and profitable bet back then compared to today. It's like the complete opposite today.
IRS can only go up, people are having to borrow up to 10x the average wage for an average home in most of the south east. Deposits are much,much bigger. Competition from older buy to letters is adding to the costs of ftb.
Ftb average is something like 38 now.

HOWEVER. 

I think we have a player in Gueye who will be better than Delph once he gets up to speed in the Prem. 

Also, I read yesterday that Sherwood had been impressed by Gil, and wanted him and Grealish to compete for the no.10 role at CAM. If we have those two with Joe Cole mentoring them, I think we could be okay in that position. 

If we get Amavi over the line, sign a new CM/CDM and get a striker to replace Benteke who is of a similar mould, but less polished, we could well be okay. I'm seeing links to Martial, who is amazing, especially for his age. But I can't see Monaco letting him leave. I think the best signing we could possibly get would be Fernando Llorente. But again, there's a lot of competition there. 

So, I'm bitter, but all I can do is trust Tim and hope we can do what Southampton do, which is sell players and then replace them quickly and move on. Fuck Delph, he doesn't deserve to be the one who fucks us over in the long term.

null,false,MajesticSlug,null,BioMed,null,"Hi OP, I have graduated this year from Biomedical Sciences (BSc). /u/Haford has given a pretty good description what you should expect in terms of academics in second year of biomed at Brunel. 

So in 2nd year you get to chose 2 out of 4 modules: Medical Microbiology (the one with the long pathogens names, and my personal favorite), Metabolic Regulation, Analytical Biochemistry, Genetics &amp; Development. - I personally went with Microbiology and Genetics: turns out I loved microbiology and didn't like genetics; but I thought that both the lecturers of these modules were good. 

On top of this, in second year you also get to 3 compulsory modules: Pathology, Cellular Biology, Immunology. 

Courseworkwise for second year: 1 essay per module based on a study case (so 5 in total) that you have 3 weeks to do each and given to you at different periods of the year. You also get a sitted exam for each module in May (that's your finals). And you also get on top of that a poster presentation in May with a topic that usually covers knowledge from multiple modules. 

..

Now 3rd year: you get to chose all your modules. I don't remember the full list, but it's in the Brunel website *( [see here](http://www.brunel.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/biomedical-sciences-bsc) )*. I chose Microbial Pathogensesis, Immunolgy, Cancerology, Endocrinolgy. 
Regarding the courseworks, it's the same format as 2nd year but you don't have to present a poster. 

You also get to do your final year project, which you chose the summer before and start on in September until January. You have to make presentation of your project in January as well as handing in your project dissertation. 

..

Regarding accreditation, yes indeed we are not accredited by the IBMS, however class of 2015 is the first one to be accredited by the Royal Society of Biology (so I got that). 

.. 

In terms of prospects, I went on to work for a full year in a laboratory as a researcher in microbiology (which is my favorite subject in biomedical science). I am still working at the moment. Most of my friends went to to do Masters degrees, and got accepted to Imperial College, UCL, Edinburgh Uni, Durham, Queen Mary. Some friends also went on to do Grad medical school and PhDs

This also implicitly allows for hourly part time (non-zero hour) work too.

The big change would be that people couldn't advertise a zero hour contract. Only full time, on a weekly rate, or part time on an hourly rate.

If theres something wrong with it(which you would have to claim is the case with performance - though 'slow as shit' is quite subjective), you've got around 6 months to return it as a defect in the product which renders it not fit for purpose. After that period, that argument is *really* hard to make. But returning in those circumstances only entitles you to a repair first, then a replacement if the repair is inadequate. It doesn't entitle you to an upgrade, which is what the new model is, despite being the same price. EU law does allow for a longer warranty on products, increasing the length for electronic goods specifically, but that won't help you here in getting the new device. 

In my opinion, you could raise the speed issue with them and they'll have a look at it, but you'll get the same device back, or you could try an exchange where the value of your device is discounted from the new model (but you obviously pay a contribution towards the new model). Apple is all about it's own image and being consumer friendly.

Whatever the salute, whatever the context, the Nazis were effectively 'new' in 1933. To an international audience, the Nazi salute had no context applied outside of it being used by that ranty bloke in Germany.

He's been tearing up the german league and just became a starting player in the Brazilian national team. The Brazilian NT is arguably not as good as it used to be, but it's still something.

Further, Firmino was a player that was heavily rumored to join bigger clubs, someone that seemed just out of reach for a club of our size (sadly, we haven't been a title challenging team in the last years). So he was a massive confidence boost to a lot of fans who were disillusioned after the past season.

Arguably it was a very good ""tactical"" signing by the club, because it silenced many of the louder critics of the clubs' leadership. For years, fans have asked for a ""marquee"" signing, an expensive but proven world class player that serves as a statement of intent, showing that LFC even though not being one of the top clubs *right now*, is at least aspiring to get to the top and challenge for the title. Firmino is that player for many fans. 

If anything, right now, a lot of fans are calling for others to lower their expectations. Firmino hasn't actually joined the club yet. Since he and (fan favorite) Coutinho both played the Copa America for Brazil, they got a prolonged vacation from the club and will join up with the squad in the coming week or so. So Firmino will probably need time to settle in the team, get to know his new team mates and get used to the way Liverpool plays. Further, he needs to acclimatize to the Premier League, having never played here before. Although the Bundesliga is arguably the league which is most similar to the PL.

Me on the other hand, I will keep my high expectations. When you sign a brazilian internatonal who scored around 20 goals in a season in Bundesliga for ~30m pounds, you should expect him to hit the ground running.

null,false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"&gt; fixing MP pay at the average national salary

That doesn't work at all. What MPs need that most people on national average salary don't:

* Apartment/house in London.
* Long distance travel between London and constituency (for most).
* Small private office.
* London living prices.
* Decent clothes to be presentable on TV and at events (do we *actually* want the leader of our country turning up to the G20 in a primark suit? )

I understand that most of these things are covered by expenses, but people seem keen to cut those back. Median salary for the nation is about £22,000. That is far too little. Median for London is about £34,500 [[Source]](http://www.cityam.com/206242/where-can-you-earn-most-uk-pay-london-much-higher-any-other-part-uk) and that still isn't much for living in London - unless sharing the rent with a partner, most people still have to live in flat shares for that, and are we really expecting an MP to live in a flat share? This is considering that the smallest, shittiest studio apartments are generally £900+ per month. After tax, £22,000 is about £18,000, so after rent on a reasonable but not great place, that leaves about £500 per month for all food, personal travel, clothes. For the people that literally write our country's laws.

MPs generally work very long and hard hours - comparable to most people in the City. They are always 'on call' and often have their entire personal lives dragged through the mud by the media. If their family live in constituency, they often don't see their families for long periods of time, or they move the family to London and don't spend enough time in constituency. 

All this, and then consider that a 25-30 year old in the City of London, doing a graduate job that requires a lesser degree of expertise, can happily be earning £70,000-£100,000.

I'm not suggesting paying MPs £200,000 upwards, which is what someone at their seniority would likely get in private sector London. But paying them £22,000 would just be unnecessarily punitive. The idea is just a lashing out at 'politicians' for being 'arseholes', without actually thinking through the consequences. 

Before you start saying that it is good that MPs should struggle for money, ask yourself who are the ones actually launching an assault on the poor. The Tories. And how many of them are independently wealthy? Most. So what would change? How many of the Labour party and SNP are independently wealthy? Many, but far fewer. So this would incentivise them to... what? Lower their own taxes and cut welfare spending more? Push for a higher salary? It certainly wouldn't have the effect that you might hope for, even possibly driving away bright people who aren't independently wealthy already.

This is also pointing out that even in a large economic upturn (which the government has some limited control over and parliament has almost none), the income of the average family fluctuates by maybe a few hundred pounds. So this £22,000 to live in London would never really increase much except in mass inflation.

Finally, there is the point that if public servants are paid properly, they are far less susceptible to bribery and corruption. If you are earning fuck all, then someone coming along and offering you a cushy corporate job is *even more* tempting than it is now. 

If you don't like MPs then think of expense reform, accommodation, recall, that sort of thing. Slashing salaries down to £22,000 is silly.

By the way, I'd be fine with paying MPs £30,000 if the job was in Northumbria and they had fully government-supplied accommodation. But it's frankly a silly idea in London.",null,0,null,1437210405,null,0,false,0,ct7jksu,null,t3_3do4ci,null,t1_ct7jksu,null,t1_ct7j6ua,null,null,null,1437963200,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

Have you thought about the total cost of this course vs how useful it will be?

It's going to need at least 3 and maybe 4 years to do the course, that's 18-24k in fees alone. Then living in London costs maybe 10k a year so that's another 30-40k so the total cost is going to be 48-64k. That's not including the lost wages that could have been earned in that time.

Now maybe you are very rich and can easily afford it, but then it surprises me you are worried about an extra 1.6k. (I completely agree if they said 6k it should be 6k so you have a valid point there).

The other issue is what about PhD funding? If your girlfriend unable to get funding then the PhD may not be very useful and will not increase her future employment prospects much. [This article](http://www.theguardian.com/careers/phd-right-career-option) says a PhD can add as little as 3% to your lifetime earnings.

So you may be spending 50k on 3 years of slog to get something which is not worth very much at the end of the day (apart from calling yourself doctor).

If she really cares about the subject and thinks the research is genuinely valuable then it might be a good idea to try to get someone else to pay (funding bodies or private companies). If no one thinks the work is valuable you might be better off with a house and a library card.

That's literally the definition of responsible!

*being the primary cause of something and so able to be blamed or credited for it.*

Basically, being responsible for something means being the person who takes the hit if something goes wrong. MPs do not have any such responsibility.

&gt;The fact that my MP doesn't necessarily share the same views as me doesn't mean they don't have a responsibility to represent me.

That makes no sense. They do not have an obligation to represent you. They represent their constituency, yes, but only in the most basic sense. For example, they will follow a 3 line whip no matter what all their constituents say. MPs act in accordance with their party and their own personal beliefs - they do not represent you in reality.

&gt;Representing your party and running an office are defacto responsibilities of the job.

This is flat out wrong. Political parties do not have any relationship to the job responsibility-wise. You are elected as an MP only, not a Labour or Conservative MP. Who pays for it is not a different argument - we don't pay for it. All MPs are free to vote how they please, but they will be kicked out of the party if they vote against the whip.

Now, as far as I know, parliament voted to help the people of Iraq by offering military action, however action in Syria was expressly excluded.

So, My take on this is that Cameron is somehow doing something wrong on both a national and international level.

My personal take on this is that Bush and Blair caused the problem to start with, so maybe we do have an obligation to the people of the Middle East to sort out the shit we caused - Just as we have in Libya.  This should however be done legally through the UN and Parliament.

However the main reasons that America is progressing faster are: 

1. Weed simply isn't that big here, therefore the problems of it being illegal don't create the required political capital for change. [America has a cannabis useage rate that is over double that of Englands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_cannabis_use_by_country). More people using it = more media noise about it being illegal = more potential votes =politicians make changes. At the moment, we simply don't have that many people into weed. 


2. We don't have a federal system like America does. If our counties were like American states and had more control over laws, then we might see certain areas of the country (areas around Bristol, Brighton, London etc) gradually legalising weed while others don't. This gradual approach allows the first states to legalise to be experiments that other states can learn from, and then make the case for legalisation themselves. 

 At the moment, we have an all or nothing system where weed is either legal or illegal, regardless of geography, so change isn't gradual so we don't explicitly see progress like you can see in america but we do have hidden progress like changes in opinion. (There are many advantages to our all or nothing system too, don't take this as an argument to get rid of it).

3. America has a wider drug problem that we simply don't have. Weed is just one aspect of severe problems with America's problems with drugs such as drug cartels, [home made crystal meth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23453028), meth cities (see louis theroux's documentary on Fresno, the city addicted to Crystal Meth), cocaine trafficking, prison overcrowding, gang culture. They have far more reason to be trying new things than we do, because they have far more of a problem. We have issues around opiates flowing from central asia through Europe, but it hasn't translated into the same problems as crystal meth or crack cocaine have for America. The three strikes legal system in some states also exacerbates the problem in America whereas our legal system is more sensible. 

 But if something is less of a problem, there is less reason to be addressing it. We have other priorities when it comes to politics and policies that demand more attention.

I don't see quite you're saying ... if they can't afford insurance, then they'll carry no debt, since no-one will give them credit. 

Although it's potentially a slippery slope ... an argumental point that often feels specious to me, it should be reiterated we're only discussing outliers - criminals that are *so* hardened they're thought to be beyond redemption. Not necessarily 'lifers', but this category. They already receive sub par treatment - the nature of prison means access is limited ... why not formalise this reality with tiered medical care, and save the NHS money, that's better spent on a population that *doesn't* hurt one another? Why should a criminal with no hope of release / reintegration receive the same expensive drugs and medical care afforded a teacher, or an OAP, or a veteran? 

If resources were freely available / treatment were cheap, this wouldn't be a worthy conversation - treatment of prisoners is a good measure of a society's 'humanity'... but it seems that the NHS is struggling, and we need to find to some method of saving funds. 

&gt; ... they're long-term residents who have made sufficient contribution to the national economy to pay for it ...

This is not the point I'd want to make. It's certainly not someone's accent or skin colour than interests any right thinking person. 

I don't propose moving to a purely capitalist system where value added is the measure of a person. Prisoners / violent offenders wouldn't be tiered because they're poor contributors, but because they've violated the social contract. Already we punish them, and - as you note - reduce their QALY ... but not because they're poor, explicitly, but because they don't deserve our generosity. Why would medical care be different?

Why should we pay *more* for people who refuse to abide by the rules? Violence is an easy one ... but what about smokers? What about alcoholics who refuse treatment? Drug addicts? What about the morbidly obese who refuse treatment? What about people that partake in dangerous activities, like motorcycle transport? 

The amount of resources devoted to people that mKe poor life style choices is staggering, and we'd instantly 'fix' the NHS budgeting problems ... and perhaps even their own personal problems at the same time. As it stands there's an expectation of care irrespective of action, and action without consequence is contrary to our understanding, and indeed the reality, of the world. Sure, obesity is in *itself* a pretty nasty consequence ... but it seems a whole new level of perverse to then continue on and assert we all deserve the same level of care even though some people follow the rules whilst others refuse.

&gt; So that Britons abroad get reciprocal care in those countries

In most of the world we have to pay for private medical care, usually handled through insurance, anyway. Providing universal health care to support the privileged few who travel abroad is nuts ... Besides, reciprocal care is still permissible under a tiered system - emergency care is still very much a given.

...

The closest argument I can think for universal care is - it's *intuitively* the right thing to do ... but this is insufficient in the face of debate, and is meaningless when feelings come into play with the care of family or one's self.",null,0,null,1437215313,null,0,false,0,ct7kmr4,null,t3_3ddcvp,null,t1_ct7kmr4,null,t1_ct7hjj5,null,null,null,1437964041,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You have the LGBT community which has finally had huge breakthroughs after decades of judgement and inequality. Additionally, you have many members of the public who say a political figure say they are religious and are reminded of figures like Blair.

Personally, I think Farron believes in distinguishing public vs. private morality. He initially voted for gay marriage and later abstained as he had issue with forcing vicars, priests, rabbis and other figures to act in a way against their own moral system - however, he had no issue with state marriages or sympathetic vicars from ordaining a gay marriage.

Additionally, he has gone on to state he opposes religious schools as he believes the state has no right to force a religion upon childen. He has said he's religious but doesn't feel like he should impose that on others although he has the right to have his own beliefs.

It's a complicated viewpoint and one I sympathise with completely. However, when people see someone who says 'I believe in God', who abstains on gay marriage and then refuses to deny he finds it a sin - it is easy for people to look at him and call him a bigot.

He is a true social liberal: saying all beliefs are permitted and the state has no role in people's private lives. But a lot of people don't like or want that. They want someone who is willing to enforce laws against homophobia and racism.

And if you work and have health insurance there by the employer, chances are, it will cover a good chunk. But I'm saying this for British people that'd be able to afford moving to the US if they got the chance. Obviously low-income American families is different than a British person with the opportunity to move. 

You're making things sound way worse than it actually is. Britons are living paycheck-to-paycheck and living in cramped old rented flats. Unless you're staying because of family or legitimate reasons (preferring to live in a history-rich country IS legitimate imo), if you have the opportunity to move, life in the US is generally a lot cheaper than in the UK. 

The average holidays you get per year is lower in the US, yes, but you have to think about the trade-offs too. If your worry is that you will get 10 less days per year of vacation in an entry-level position (usually professionals get at least 15-20 if they bother to request or by gaining 1 extra day per year for working at the company for another year), then you might have to set your priorities straight. 

I'm not an expat like you, but I'm American living in the UK temporarily (master's + placement work). And my bf lives here and I had enough money saved up to come live closer to him whilst he finished his education. But I'm quickly changing my mind on where I want to live in the near future. UK is great in terms of having access to beautiful scenery, architecture, and history. But even with my degree, I doubt I'll be making more than £25k-28k a year before expenses for the next 5 years. And everything is absolutely dead expensive here. Bills, rent (and I live in one of the cheapest middle-sized towns in England), transportation (train/petrol), clothes, and generally all products.

&gt;The presumed references to 'homosexuality' itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words, arsenokoitēs (ἀρσενοκοίτης), malakos (μαλακός), and porneia. While it is not disputed that the three Greek words concern sexual relations between men (and possibly between women), some academics interpret the relevant passages as a prohibition against pederasty or prostitution rather than homosexuality per se, while other scholars have presented counter arguments. The historical context of the passages has also been a subject of debate. 

So nobody can really say for sure, so its a controversial subject and based on your own interpretation like a lot of stuff, so naturally bias will take over. The translations of bible that directly include the word ""homosexual"" are taking liberties with it I think though, since that didn't exist until a prussian activist coined ""homosexual"" and ""heterosexual"" in a letter in the late 19th century. 

*Either way you could probably interperet anything in the Bible to justify something or other, but you have to pick something you could get away with, you couldn't keep a slave or beat your kid and justify it by saying its in the bible, there's only certain things you could get away with. But if you can break one law and justify it on religion, how do you justify preventing the breaking of a more severe law based on religion?

It's a small move in that direction as it is unlikely to go through parliament, but when the Lords are more progressive than the Commons, it shows that there may be progress. Certainly, the amendment to require the Secretary of State to conduct an independent expert review of current drugs legislation and its success/failure seems likely to be included.

&amp;nbsp;

And a relevant quote from the discussion:
&gt;I will be clear: the Liberal Democrats are as concerned about the harm caused by the misuse of drugs in general, and the misuse of new psychoactive substances in particular, as anyone else in this House, including the Government. Liberal Democrats want what parents and families want. Parents want their children to avoid taking drugs. The evidence suggests that education, rather than criminalisation, is more likely to achieve that end. If their children use drugs, they do not want them to be harmed by taking them, let alone be killed by them. The evidence suggests that the best way to do that is through education and concentrating resources on the drug dealers, not the users. If their children use drugs, the last thing they want is for the rest of their children’s lives to be ruined by a criminal record for simply having small amounts of a relatively harmless substance on them. Educate them if they are being reckless, and if they are addicted, treat them.

* In theory buy-to-let vs buy-to-own should be self-balancing, the number of properties to let would grow to the level to support a healthy rental market.  If there was too many rental properties, rents would be too low to attract new landlords.  If there were too few rental properties, rent would be so high that landlords would expand, etc.

* But, due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to previous tax benefits; a buy-to-let operator can more readily raise funding than a buy-to-own operator could.

* Combine this with a rapidly declining number of sales, and you have buy-to-letters cornering the market.

* Because of the the two previous points, the first point doesn't happen, and instead you get buy-to-letters in a feedback cycle seeking capital gains as long as the rent covers the expenses.  But: a) the capital gains only come from other buy-to-letters, and b) the rent only covers the expenses because of the tax benefits.

So yeah, there are more rental properties than there would otherwise be, and many fewer properties-to-buy on the market than there would be, and it needs unwinding.

Oh they definitely knew. The first thing Hitler did was arrest all trade unionists, which is why trade unionists in the Labour party were making anti-Hitler speeches from 1933 onwards, pre-dating Churchill's anti-Hitler speeches.

And Jewish people in the USA started a Boycott Germany campaign in 1933. See

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Nazi_boycott_of_1933

Of course the 7 year old Queen is too young to be held responsible. But the Queen Mother, Edward VIII and George VI (who was behind the camera) thought it was a good idea to harass jews and arrest trade unionists.

Another fun fact: Baldwin (Conservative PM) managed to force Edward VIII to abdicate - but when George VI came to the throne, he took advantage of the crisis to refuse to pay income tax, and Baldwin caved because he didn't want a second crisis. Legally he didn't have to pay tax - the Royals had paid it because Queen Victoria was determined to support her embattled Prime Minister Robert Peel in 1848 when he re-introduced income tax by announcing that she would pay it too. Edward VII and George V then also paid. 

George VI refused - even though debt was 150% of GDP, and basic income tax was rising to pay for re-armament (it rose to 27% in 1938). Elizabeth II didn't pay it either for the first forty years of her reign till John Major's govt forced her to in 1992 (we had a recession and debt crisis then and the public were thoroughly fed-up of the royals and a new book had been published about their tax evasion).

The whole ""lets get non-voters to vote"" campaign rests on the belief that non-voters don't realise that if they don't vote, the Conservatives will be returned. **They realise it all right and they don't care**.

P.S. Ed Miliband's strategy was to target these non-voters, and the post mortem on the polls showed that these non-voters said they'd vote for him, and then didn't bother. See

I disagree. A buy-to-let landlord needs a *minimum* deposit of 25% for a rental property, plus the rental income needs to be 125% of the mortgage payments. Plus banks want to see some sort of business plan to ensure a prospective landlord fully understands what property rental entails. This is a higher criteria to meet than someone buying a house to live in.

&gt;Combine this with a rapidly declining number of sales, and you have buy-to-letters cornering the market.

Buy-to-let represents circa 10% of sales. I'd hardly call that ""cornering the market"". Sure the interest of prospective landlords in property will have an effect on house prices, but I feel it is hugely overstated. Even if you took out *every* BTL landlord from house sales, you've still got 90% of the prospective buyers.

It's probably not helped by the fact that, taking Nevada as a random example, [sales tax is not uniform even across a single state](http://www.sale-tax.com/Nevada).

I mean, it could *possibly* be semi-automated, at the store level. Say you're a store manager in Vegas, and you receive a price changes list. Before printing out the new shelf tags, you run the list through a program that multiplies each price by 1.081, to add that 8.1% sales tax onto the prices.

I'm probably warping this article to suit my world view but it seems to me employing more people will only make the problem worse. The push towards automation is great and we need a way to deal with the inevitable fallout from that.

&gt; 2.3 Extent and trends in individual drug use
Cannabis
As in previous years, cannabis was the most commonly used drug in the last year, with 6.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 using it last year. As shown in Figure 2.2, this is a similar level to 2012 to 2013 (6.3%), which was the lowest proportion since measurement began in 1996 (when the proportion was 9.4%). **The long-term trend shows that the level of last year cannabis use for 16 to 59 year olds fell between 2002 to 2003 and 2009 to 2010, following a period when it was around 10%.** Since 2009 to 2010 it has remained essentially stable at between 6 and 7 per cent.

It's a fallacious to suggest imperialism was a net benefit. 

Most of the trade was at a massive net benefit to the imperialist powers. For example, in India, a lot of trade was Britain buying food and exporting it back to the metropole. However, this continued during famines, as merchants could make more money selling to the British than selling to the Indians, which massively exaggerated the effects of the famine, resulting in tens of millions of deaths across the decades of British rule. These famines simply didn't happen to the same extent before British rule, arguably because the pre-British rulers enacted famine relief, whereas the British rulers were more focussed on free trade and Malthusianism. 

Rule of law is another one that's a bit dodgy, seeing that all of the non-settler colonies where kept undemocratically, and held by an iron fist. It was literally a case of one rule for them, and another rule for us. If you look at the Mau Mau Uprising, for example, thousands of Kenyans were killed, tortured, held without trial, or subject to other atrocities by the British colonial forces for wanting independence. Atrocities of this nature simply wouldn't happen in Britain, which makes you question how they actually brought the rule of law.

Infrastructure is another area which is exaggerated. In most countries, infrastructure was only built when it benefited the colonial powers. Most education efforts, for example, were promoted by independent sources, like missionaries. The train lines in India were only built to improve trade, which further exaggerated the effects of the famines. A number of countries were left with very little infrastructure after independence. The Congo, I believe, had less than 100 trained professions (i.e. doctors, engineers) in the country after independence. 

It's a myth to suggest many of these countries were massively improved by imperialism.

What you say just makes the disparity worse, as there's a high barrier-to-entry into the buy-to-let world, but if you're wealthy enough to start with it's easy to keep expanding.

Huh?

So every prospective BTL landlord has that money? All of them? Just like every prospective homeowner has a deposit?

And I'm not sure how a high barrier to entry is a bad thing here when you're complaining about the amount of BTL landlords you think there are. Explain....

&gt;A mere box-ticking exercise designed so the banks can create the illusion of responsibility. The mathematics of buy-to-let are pretty much universal.

Un huh... banks don't care about who they lend their money to and it's all just a face for the press? And the maths of BTL is easy as pie?

Look let's be honest here: You've never looked into BTL in your life. Not one person who either is a BTL landlord or whom is seriously looking into it would agree with your sentiment here. My local lending manager explained to me what they would demand from a prospective BTL borrower, and it was *literally* a business plan, with a ton of safeguards, hypothetical scenarios etc. A minimum of 125% of the mortgage in rent is needed. The ability to fund void periods must be demonstrable. A minimum salary is applicable. The notion that it is simple or straight forward is the sort of thing you would only believe if you've done zero research into it.

&gt;They're disproportionately concentrated in certain segments of the market, the one/two-bed-flat in a dormitory town market to be precise.

Nonsense. There are numerous segments that have differing levels depending on where in the country you are. There are short lets to businesses or corporations to be found in the square mile. There are student lets in university cities. There are DSS rentals in poorer areas. There are regulated tenancies. There are large houses let to wealthy foreigners working here for an extended period of time.... I could go on.

&gt; Also, do you have a reference for 10%? The only sources I can find say at present 18% of homes are owned by ""investors"" and that proportion is growing, which will imply the rate is at least higher than 18%...

It was at a presentation I recently attended by a bunch of experts in the BTL market (one of the presenters was the lending manager, who would have a huge laugh at your belief that the eligibility criteria is a mere box-ticking exercise). I'll dig out the slides he gave me and I'll find the source for them.

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; So every prospective BTL landlord has that money? All of them? Just like every prospective homeowner has a deposit?

No, nothing like that.

&gt; And I'm not sure how a high barrier to entry is a bad thing here when you're complaining about the amount of BTL landlords you think there are. Explain....

Because it concentrates property in fewer-and-fewer hands.  If BTL had no barrier to entry, it would lead to a bizarre world where no-one owned their own home, but owned someone else's.  As odd as that is, it would be preferable to a class of landlord owning dozens/hundreds of properties each.

&gt; Look let's be honest here: You've never looked into BTL in your life. Not one person who either is a BTL landlord or whom is seriously looking into it would agree with your sentiment here. My local lending manager explained to me what they would demand from a prospective BTL borrower, and it was literally a business plan, with a ton of safeguards, hypothetical scenarios etc. A minimum of 125% of the mortgage in rent is needed. The ability to fund void periods must be demonstrable. A minimum salary is applicable. The notion that it is simple or straight forward is the sort of thing you would only believe if you've done zero research into it.

You're misunderstanding me.  I'm not saying anyone can be a BTL landlord, indeed I have made the precise opposite point several times, nor that it is *easy*.  I'm saying that BTL landlords have it *easier*, which is a different but subtle argument.  A moderately well-organised landlord can answer all of those questions easily, their existing portfolio (assuming their total LTV is sensible) is mitigation.

I would, however, challenge your assertion that all of those checks are performed all the time.  In London there is no way new properties to rent are being offered at 125% the cost of an interest-only mortgage (even after taking a 25% deposit into account).

There are either a lot of back-doors to mortgage funding, or the BTL army is more cash-rich that they claim (see my previous point about 25% being easy for them).

&gt; Nonsense.

Ok then...

&gt; There are numerous segments that have differing levels depending on where in the country you are.

That is precisely the same as what I said!

&gt; &gt; Also, do you have a reference for 10%? The only sources I can find say at present 18% of homes are owned by ""investors"" and that proportion is growing, which will imply the rate is at least higher than 18%...

&gt; It was at a presentation I recently attended by a bunch of experts in the BTL market (one of the presenters was the lending manager, who would have a huge laugh at your belief that the eligibility criteria is a mere box-ticking exercise). I'll dig out the slides he gave me and I'll find the source for them.

Cool.  It seems to be an opaque measure as no-one really knows.  In much of the London dormitory boroughs estate agents have given up selling entry-level properties to individuals.  I'm on the mailing lists of a few and about 18 months ago they stopped sending me a single weekly ""new homes"" email; instead they send two ""investment opportunities"" (1/2-bed places less than £750k), and ""new homes"" (everything else).",null,0,null,1437223614,null,0,false,0,ct7mn32,null,t3_3dpwzz,null,t1_ct7mn32,null,t1_ct7m5j1,null,null,null,1437965306,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That's usually post-event justification on behalf of the non-voter.

It goes like this. It's election day but they don't feel like getting off the sofa to vote. It doesn't matter, they think, that Cameron is not so bad, so nothing bad will happen if I don't vote. 

Then distressed Labour canvasser comes to the door. Why didn't you vote? ""You are all the same"". Puts big guilt trip on the Labour canvasser, and then goes back to plonk themselves back on sofa, having post-justified the fact that they didn't go to the polling booth on the Labour party. 

But nothing you offer them will make them vote. Screaming Lord Sutch (from the Monster Loonies) was remarking all the way back in the 1960's that Labour voters just refused to turn out. 

P.S. Try this. Volunteer to canvass for your local CLP for the next council elections. Volunteer to handle wards with low turnouts - and then see how you go. If you increase their turnout, more power to your elbow.

null,false,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,null,"The whole concept of ""banning encryption"" or stopping encryption from being strong enough or building in a backdoor or anything of the sort ***does not stop*** those who want to communicate securely without the government watching them from doing so over the internet.

If your goal is to communicate securely and this is of importance to you, then there is nothing anyone can do to stop you. Sure they can spy on Skype and GMail and whatever else they like, but all that will do is mean they can view everything that the people still using those services say. A competent terrorist who really wants to cover their tracks will, knowing this, simply use another method.

As an example:

Let's say for example I want to send a secure message from myself to a friend and back again. So we both install some software that encodes encrypted data within a JPEG image.

That would simply not even pass muster unless you a) knew of the software creating it, b) had some way of discerning when an image was made using this (could be extremely difficult or impossible given that you could make it a 100% valid jpeg and have all data contained within the standard format data), and then c) actually notice these images in the first place to check them.

Now even if by some miracle someone managed all of the above, you still can't read the message because they're using strong encryption (banned and illegal, sure!) But anyway the end result is you have a couple of people sharing cat pictures over Skype in plain sight and actually communicating with 100% security the whole time.

Basically what I am getting at is:

The idea that people who really need to hide their communication would keep on communicating over methods that they now know to be insecure is pretty dumb.

The only way this sort of system is effective is if you can do it without the general public knowing it is being done. Which is probably what they have been doing before with various security holes found in encryption methods.

null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; Because it concentrates property in fewer-and-fewer hands.  If BTL had no barrier to entry, it would lead to a bizarre world where no-one owned their own home, but owned someone else's.  As odd as that is, it would be preferable to a class of landlord owning dozens/hundreds of properties each.

Except the ""landlord class"" don't tend to own dozens/hundreds of properties each. Typically a landlord owns 1-3 properties. Sure there are some who own dozens or hundreds (typically people who became wealthy elsewhere and are investing, like footballers), but the majority of landlords are individuals with small portfolios. I'm not sure where you've got your notion of landlords being a tiny number owning a huge chunk of the UK's property, but it's very much not the case.

&gt; I'm saying that BTL landlords have it easier, which is a different but subtle argument. A moderately well-organised landlord can answer all of those questions easily, their existing portfolio (assuming their total LTV is sensible) is mitigation.

I'm sure experienced landlords could easily answer those questions, but that is different to those questions being easy. Contrary to what you seem to think, banks *are* rigorous with checking prospective landlords have all their facts sorted and have covered all bases. If an experienced landlord can go through this process easily, that's because he has done it so many times that it's second nature. That doesn't mean it's a box-ticking exercise.

Just like an experienced mathematician could do the formula for compound interest on a sum quickly. That doesn't mean it's an easy sum to work out, it just means he's so experienced in that area of maths that it's second nature to him.

&gt;I would, however, challenge your assertion that all of those checks are performed all the time. In London there is no way new properties to rent are being offered at 125% the cost of an interest-only mortgage (even after taking a 25% deposit into account).

You do realise your response here is basically one from incredulity, right? It doesn't *sound* right to you (with next to no experience from the Landlord's side) so it must be wrong?

Let's work through the maths: A flat up for £500,000 with a 25% deposit (£125,000) and a mortgage of £375,000.

On these figures, the monthly interest on a 2-year fixed at 2.75% is £860. The landlord must achieve a rental income of £1,075 a month minimum to get a BTL mortgage on this property, which is easily achievable. If he goes for a 5-year fixed at 3.79%, then he's looking at a mortgage cost of £1,184 and a minimum rental income of £1,480.

Now considering that a 5% yield on a £500k property (a bit on the conservative side of property yields) would bring in £2,083 a month, you can see how it's not smoke-and-mirrors, or some hidden bundle of cash. As long as there's nothing really odd or unusually expensive about the property, or something that would drive the rent down, it's quite achievable to get the desired rent.

Of course a landlord would have to do a full rundown of service charges, ground rents, maintenance, void periods etc before being granted, but that should illustrate how it works regarding the 25% deposit and achieving the correct rent.",null,0,null,1437226203,null,0,1437226391,0,ct7ngy3,null,t3_3dpwzz,null,t1_ct7ngy3,null,t1_ct7mn32,null,null,null,1437965551,null,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

Yes, but then the calorie content is measured and recorded so it can be put on the menu/packaging. 

Now, how are we going to work out the calorie equivalent for petrol? Well you need to take the volume of petrol sold, multiply it by the MPG to get the distance you can travel with that much petrol. Then you're going to multiply that distance by the amount of calories it would take the average person to walk/run/cycle that same distance.

Now you might have noticed there's a severe flaw in this plan. How is the petrol pump going to work out how far you can travel on that fuel? Well it's going to need to know, at the very least:

1: How fast you will be going.

2: The exact make and model of your car and its performance at different speeds.

If you don't have that info, you might as well just put a random number generator on the pump. 

Now you might say that the amount of calories burnt will vary from individual to individual, and that's certainly true.

Salmond said that the oil price of $116 used in the SNP's white paper was ""conservative"" and it could go to three times as much. So his supporters were thinking, oil of $300 a barrel! We'll never have to work again!

In reality, oil had been over $100 for only five years in it's entire history, at teh time of the referendum it was $93, and people like the Norwegian central bank were predicting a fall.

In other words, the SNP were using Nigerian get-rich-quick tactics to persuade voters to vote for their own destitution and when Labour called them out on that we got accused of scaremongering.

The oil price is now below $50, and if Scotland had become independent they would have been suffering super-austerity-max. And Salmond would have said, ""tough, no revote, suckers"".

I suppose there are some people who look at the SNP's success and think, why don't *we* lie like that. Who cares if we're selling a scam, scamming *works*.

But parties who lie like that come undone - it will happen to the SNP too. It's not an example to copy.

At the moment their voters are rationalising the oil thing based on ""they didn't know"" (even though Salmond was an oil economist) and ""it's only a bonus"".

The last census back in 2011 (with all it's jedi knight trolling) still produced a slim majority for Christianity but it's doubtful whether it would today and doubtful how many of those 'Christians' were Christians in any meaningful sense in that they don't attend church even irregularly.

I would say it's now more accurate to say Britain is a godless land of squalor and cruelty, with a long Christian heritage. Much as we still have a vestigal monarchy while really being governed by the Eton old boys.

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; Except the ""landlord class"" don't tend to own dozens/hundreds of properties each. Typically a landlord owns 1-3 properties. Sure there are some who own dozens or hundreds (typically people who became wealthy elsewhere and are investing, like footballers), but the majority of landlords are individuals with small portfolios. I'm not sure where you've got your notion of landlords being a tiny number owning a huge chunk of the UK's property, but it's very much not the case.

I think we've crossed the threshold into purely-semantic arguing about two comments ago.

Of course the number of landlords with large numbers of properties is smaller than those with fewer properties, but: a) that still demonstrates the wealth-concentrating effects of BTL, even a maximum of three per person would still show that; and b) small-scale landlords are probably going to be unaffected (or less affected) by the tax rules changing anyway.  We were originally talking about the author of the open-letter in the original article who claimed annual rental income of £300,000.  What's the average annual rent, he doesn't mention a specific area but £300,000 per year in rent is probably somewhere between 15 and 30 properties.

An individual with one BTL property is going to influence the housing market less than one with thirty.  If landlords with thirty properties have to reduce their holdings, that will be beneficial for the efficient running of the market as a whole.  And other landlords with different amounts will have a proportional effect.

&gt; Just like an experienced mathematician could do the formula for compound interest on a sum quickly. That doesn't mean it's an easy sum to work out, it just means he's so experienced in that area of maths that it's second nature to him.

This is what I meant by the mathematics being identical.  There may well be a long checklist, each point may indeed need proof.  But, at the end of the day, the mathematics of BTL is a constant.  Banks aren't checking if individuals have the Donald Trump gene, they're checking that the numbers plugged into the spreadsheet meet the target at the end.

&gt; You do realise your response here is basically one from incredulity, right? It doesn't sound right to you (with next to no experience from the Landlord's side) so it must be wrong?

Experience on any one side doesn't change these numbers either.  There's nothing (new on the market) in most of the popular parts of South East England that gets near a 5% yield, out of my own sample (checking rental asking prices against sold-prices from Land Registry, albeit having to guess the size of the mortgage) it doesn't add up.  There are other towns and cities where getting in-excess of 5% is easy however.

The problem is lack of data to draw any market-wide conclusions.  Size of mortgage and achieved rental prices are opaque.

Although you do mention one interesting thing:

&gt; On these figures, the monthly interest on a 2-year fixed at 2.75% is £860. The landlord must achieve a rental income of £1,075 a month minimum to get a BTL mortgage on this property

So the 125% goal is tested against the fixed rate?  I didn't know that.  But that would bring things neatly back to my original position that BTL has it easier in arranging finance.  The lending criteria for owner-occupier mortgages (which is also a box-ticking exercise, by the way) are supposed to validate a persons earnings against not-only the standard rate after any fixed/discounted rate expires, but also against earnings should interest rates go up a couple of notches (well 3 percentage points, source: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/Pages/fpc/intereststress.aspx).  

So let's use the £500,000 example again, and just to make the comparisons easier I'll also assume a 25% deposit (although for a first-time buyer this is highly unlikely).  On a repayment (25 years) mortgage at 1.75% (the cheapest I found for a 75% LTV, would be much higher for 90% LTVs), the monthly repayments would be £1,543 per month; the rate after the fixed period is 4.49% or £2,082 per month; and the stress-test for affordability would be three percentage points higher or 7.49% or £2,768 per month.

Disclaimer: not all lenders apply this particular test, and those that do will often fudge it.

But it only illustrates my point.  For every box-ticking exercise/onerous burden of proof a bank applies to Buy-to-Let financing, they apply something more stringent to owner-occupier financing.  You effectively only have to prove you can find a tenant on half the earnings you yourself would need to buy it for yourself.  Many people would be better off renting from themselves if they could get away with it...",null,0,null,1437228775,null,0,false,0,ct7of8x,null,t3_3dpwzz,null,t1_ct7of8x,null,t1_ct7ngy3,null,null,null,1440474510,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt; Why is Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour Party? This one stumps me. His ideological prescriptions are better suited to one of the rump Marxist outfits of the faculty lounge left. Contrary to the myth-making of his acolytes, Corbyn does not represent the ""Old Labour Party"" before it was corrupted by Blair and all that unseemly election-winning business. He belongs to a fringe always present in the labour movement and rejected by every successful Labour leader in a century.

You can't get annoyed at people saying that some candidates on one side of the spectrum shouldn't be in the party, then applaud as other people say the candidate on the other side of the spectrum shouldn't be in the party...

I agree with you that the people accusing Liz of being ""basically Tory"" need to shut the fuck up and treat her with respect and civility, but it's a two-way street.. This leadership contest is supposed to be a time of introspection into the party's values, it's not the time for us to go slinging shit at each other.

This article is about as disrespectful as all the crap that those on the far-left of the party are saying.

EDIT: I'm currently catching up on the hustings, and I think we should take note of how the candidates themselves behave. Liz and Jeremy were sat next to each-other in Stevenage, and they had clear respect for each other, even if they didn't agree. Liz would nod along and agree to things Jeremy said and vice versa, they would laugh at each other's jokes, and generally acted as comrades. Yet then you come here or talk to other MPs and its ""Oh my god why doesn't Liz just fuck off to the Tories"" or ""Corbyn is such a fucking dinosaur, why doesn't his Stalinist arse just fuck off to the 1940s"".

TI 5, It's alive! The biggest International ever is here!

&amp;nbsp;

The world's best teams! The biggest esports prize pool ever! (16 million dollars and counting!) - Valve pulling out all the stops, Chronosphering valve-

time and giving us a Saturday grand final!
Come and watch it with us, live on the big screen, see all the big plays, the goofy coverage, those stats! All in the centre of the Big Smoke, whilst 

enjoying the comfort of sitting in a pub!

Based at Draft House Seething Lane, 5 minutes walk from Tower Hill station, we're going to bring you good beer, good food and, most of all, great DOTA on a 

huge screen.

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a google gallery of the pub!](https://goo.gl/UYWpth)

&amp;nbsp;

We'll be showing the entirety of the event's final day starting from 5pm right until the last GG is called.
Our aim is for this to be a comfortable experience, every attendee gets a seat at a table with a good view of the action and food and drinks will be 

available at the bar.

Seats will not be reserved, but where possible we will sit groups together. Arriving early will guarantee your choice of position.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the reasons we're going to be at Seething Lane is that, along with being a DOTA fan, one of our organisers is a massive beer geek (or craft beer 

wanker?  You decide!!!). We'll have a range of keg and cask beers and loads of bottles available, as well as wines, cocktails and soft drinks. Brewmaster 

would be proud! Along side the beery goodness will be an awesome American style menu with burgers, hotdogs, pulled pork sarnies and... salads... incase you 

just wanna tango your way through the night!

&amp;nbsp;

[Check out their website.](http://www.drafthouse.co.uk/)

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is their full menu.](http://www.drafthouse.co.uk/media/34140/dh220-march-menu-22-main.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

Doors will open at 5pm, with the pre-show scheduled to start at 6pm. The lower bracket final (best of 3) will be beginning shortly after with the Grand 

Final (best of 5) following.

&amp;nbsp;

We hope to update you with more, so please watch this space!

&amp;nbsp;

Our tickets are £10 for the night and include one free drink from our selection.

The return of hand car washes shows how we're going backwards in productivity. The government are relying on low wages which is killing productivity. They are cutting corporation tax but not seeing companies relocate actual business in return, point this out. They have missed every deficit reduction target they have set, point this out. They are on track to miss their exports target, point this out. If we can get over our squeamishness about talking about the downsides of immigration, point out how the government have made it better for companies to hire foreign grads than train our own.

We don't even have to win the borrowing argument, just be ready to refute it with real life examples, like how most people have a huge debt/income ratio thanks to buying a house. People understand making wise investments over poor ones and borrowing to invest.

If true, an absolute major acquisition for us, and probably will be our biggest transfer of the window. Jose consistently showed us last year that in any big game, he wanted a more physical defensive presence alongside Matic in the double pivot, and preferred to push Fabregas forward. As a result, the combo of Mikel/Ramires played around 2000 minutes last season. Those minutes would now be given to Witsel, who possesses the presence that Mikel has, but also can launch attacks with his passing, unlike either Mikel (who does recycle the ball well) and Ramires. 

Another thing to consider if this is true, since we would be pushing Fabregas farther forward in big games, I think this means that we probably won't be pursuing another attacking midfielder/winger, like Pedro. Witsel takes up another spot in our crowded bench, and it seems clear to me that Fabregas/Oscar will split time at the No. 10 position, and Willian will stay at right wing, with Cuadrado hopefully providing competition for him.

My mum and sister are visiting my family and so seeking further confirmation I asked mum if she knew anything about the first ever sheep dung spitting contest in Irvinestown this year. Her first words were ""Ah! It'd have to be that eejit Joe Mahon!"". Mum, it was indeed someone called Joe Mahon. ""There's many's a lamper in Irvinestown but Joe Mahon'd be the worst of them"". I show her the article on The Impartial Reporter. ""Oh my god that's disgusting. He'd probably be the only one that did it. He has this 'oul sheepdog and he sings 'How Much Is That Doggie In The Window' to it.""
To see the name of my home county turn up on Reddit was at first intriguing then caution set in as I realised I was reading /WTF. For the record we're not all like this, the dung spitting thing is not actually 'a thing'. But I do know something of how it feels to be from Florida and see that place pop up here every so often.

null,false,B4mf0rth,null,null,null,"While I don't necessarily disagree with you, I think that argument is more complicated than a lot of people perhaps realise. Couple of examples:

1. Just because something becomes legal doesn't mean that there isn't a illegal black market to compete with, particularly if there are extensive taxes on the product to ""earn the country money"". Criminals will still be able to illegally sell weed for less than the taxed alternatives until the companies selling it legally are big enough  to create economies of scale that bring bring the price down lower than what criminals can sell it for. That will take some time.
2. There will be some proportion (I don't know if its all, a few, half or whatever) of the current criminals on convictions for weed who would still be criminals regardless of whether weed is illegal. Obviously some people do just love cannabis, and would make it their profession if it was legal or illegal. But I think most people are in it for other reasons; mainly the lack of any other opportunities. That is what makes the easy money and criminality look very attractive to those young people. Those lack of opportunities won't really disappear with the legalisation of weed. Dead towns will still be dead towns, school drop outs will still be drop outs, etc.

 Obviously I don't think all weed dealers are poor or have no other opportunities, but there will be some proportion of them who are; and even past legalisation, those people will still be enticed by the opportunities criminality provides. The new weed companies will want to hire scientists, skilled agricultural labour, business managers. There won't be a sudden influx of jobs for ex-weed dealers, there will be more jobs for the educated and trained. Many will still become criminals, just in other trades. 

Legalisation will likely prove to be a good thing, but it won't be a simple process of tax revenue increases and crime reduction.

I quite clearly said ""It would have had an impact on their ability to get business through the House though"", which it demonstrably would have done given that they required those MPs in order to get the bill through the Commons.

&gt; Firstly I really don't see how it's important that the bill passed with 'Scottish MP's' as there is no such thing as a 'Scottish MP' only an MP

It's exceptionally important.

You are correct that in theory all MPs are equal in the House however the reason why this particular bill was so contentious is because higher education is a devolved matter in Scotland, and the Labour-led devolved administration in the Scottish Parliament had very recently committed to the abolition of tuition fees in Scotland.

This was then followed by Labour MPs from Scotland voting to *impose* tuition fees on students in England and Wales, it in effect being a matter that did not impact upon their own constituents.

Legally and constitutionally there was absolutely nothing wrong with using those Scottish MPs to carry the vote, however it was morally questionable and we saw echoes of it recently with the SNP threatening to vote against the reform of the fox hunting restrictions, which is a devolved matter in Scotland and doesn't impact upon their constituents at all.

&gt; Secondly how have you calculated that the bill passed with only Scottish votes

Firstly it's matter of historical record that the government only carried the vote using Scottish MPs, but secondly because I was a student at the time and remember the media furore firsthand.

&gt; what does that matter?

It matters a great deal and had - and will continue to have - a profound impact upon this country until we have a lasting and enduring constitutional settlement that puts these sorts of issues to bed.",null,0,null,1437233415,null,0,false,0,ct7qfce,null,t3_3do41u,null,t1_ct7qfce,null,t1_ct7q16o,null,null,null,1437967685,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Melbourne didn't roll over easy and I loved that. The turn around shot that Caballero saved was quite impressive. The guy who shot had to turn around and place his foot so accurately to whip the ball in at such a tight angle and he almost succeeded. Their passing was also really nice at times.

City did great with the constant pressure and the youth players were fantastic.  As a 16 year old myself, it's amazing to see how good these guys are at such a young age. Yaya had that 13/14 presence, which was great to see. I felt like Fernando was underwhelming, but I could be wrong, as his job on the field isn't wholy glamorous. He did his job, essentially, which I guess is good enough for a preseason game. Would be great if Caballero was given more minutes imo, something like Barca's setup last season.

He's performed well. 7 goals is the kind of output you want from a CM whose primary job is to jockey the midfield and keep things ticking.

I think we'll see him either A) partnering Can in a 2-1 or B) on the sides in a 3 man midfield. He can't play as a holding midfielder since he has a different type of skill set.

He's really going to shine in Stevie's absence as he can make the kind of runs or occupy the positions Stevie normally makes or does during the build up. To be honest, I think we're going to see multiple players step up now that Stevie's gone. There's a substantial void in the dressing room, and players will want to prove to the manager that they can step in and fill that void.

Areas of improvement - goal scoring, passing range / vision.

I can negotiate all prices. And if you want to buy two or more things I may be able to split up ""bundles"".

""Special media server bundle"" MSI Z77A-GD55 motherboard (boxed with all accessories)+ Intel Celeron G1620 (has cooler), the reason I am advertising this as a media server bundle, and its low price, is because none of the front panel headers work with this motherboard. Meaning that the only way to turn a PC with this motherboard on or off is with the physical switch on the motherboard. As a media server will not be turned on or off regularly it will not be as much of a hassle.  - £60

Whilst I agree with this point, we the constituents have indeed allowed politicians to become complacent, we the public as a whole keep *actively* deciding to vote in the same person again. I personally live in a swing constituency but if a politician gets reelected, the majority of their constituents who care who represent them (read: choose to vote) must be happy with their representation.

&gt; People don't vote for people, they vote for ideology

Again, I'm inclined to agree, but if that is the criterion by which people choose to decide who represent them, who am I to consider a lesser reason? They may choose the person because of the ideology, they actually choose the person.

This would have not been the case if we went with PR, but we chose not to.

&gt; parties don't try to keep people happy

I disagree with this. Parties do try to keep people happy. Because they want the members of their party to receive votes from members of their constituency. As a recent example of a party which stopped trying to impress its voters and work with an opposing party to actually get more done (though not more that their voters wanted), look at Nick Clegg's liberal democrats. As an example of the opposite, look at the SNP and their latest Scottish approval ratings.

&gt; sling mud, avoid answers or outright lie to get in.

&gt; If a banker did that to their boss they would be fired on the spot

Workers, company directors, managers, most people *do* do that to some degree in my personal experience. I can't immediately think of an example of this where the CEO is still in power, this was exactly what happened during the fallout of the Enron scandal. And whilst it isn't a real example, it's such a trope that it's a [famous joke](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/joke-the-three-envelopes_n_1635781.html). In the 3 envelopes joke, the protagonist ""slings mud"" at their predecessor and avoids answering to the difficulties in a productive manner by simply reorganising.

&gt;  theyve also destroyed evidence of their own misconduct during an investigation of expenses and child rape

Yep, some people do shitty things to cover their own shitty deeds. I highly doubt MPs are unique in leveraging whatever power they can to cover their arse. I googled ""ceo arrested evidence tampering"" and found [this](http://www.centerforjudicialexcellence.org/cje-projects-initiatives/marin-judge-evidence-tampering/) example of such shitty actions performed by a lawyer, and several others.

Agree, wholehartedly, but the majority of Britons who care about our electoral system actively chose not to improve it. Who am I to argue with democracy.

&gt;its like the shareholder having to get a broken 'majority vote' in hopes of firing a terrible employee.

I disagree with that parallel here. In shareholder voting, the people who own the most get the most of the say. If 'the majority' (in terms of shares they control) choose to take an action for whatever reason that turns out to be to their detriment by, for example, keeping a failing director, it is still their choice to take and the director still has to answer to them.

Each constituent has an equal share in the ""ownership"" of the position of their MP. If the majority of constituents who care choose to keep a failing MP, then that is still their choice to make.

We should never take agency away from people. Even if the choice they choose is a stupid choice.",null,0,null,1437235415,null,0,1437235599,0,ct7re30,null,t3_3dlqpd,null,t1_ct7re30,null,t1_ct7ovfw,null,null,null,1437968440,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That's all the press would need for a black mark on his record forever. The only way out of this is to say ""no"", but clearly Tim does think homosexual sex is sinful and isn't prepared to lie about it. He did the next-best thing, which was to weasel around the question and not answer it but say something about being committed to Liberal principles. It makes him look weak-willed and without conviction but it's kind of vague and might be brushed off in future. 

As disappointed as I am that 1) the Lib Dem leader has obvious conflicting interests and 2) he doesn't feel he can be open to voters about them, straight out admitting his opinion would have been worse for him IMO. It's early days yet, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on this one, but it's not a great start for winning my vote in 5 years time.

Middle offensive in its infancy, it was relocated to the side of position by Claude Puel, when he arrived at the high level. A choice which, according to the technician, was better suited to the qualities of the native of Toulon, more comfortable with large spaces in front of him.



Work pay, since 55 L1 matches later, the International Espoirs is offered a challenge as attractive as exotic, which can make him a new level in his young career. Fort impact, against this peerless striker will now have the opportunity to walk his punch at Villa Park, and across the Kingdom of Albion.

City are in a weird place right now, until they sign more players I'd say they're not even close to challenging. United all depends on if they can get off to a good start and can keep De Gea. Which leaves it down to Arsenal and Chelsea.

They promised rail nationalisation through franchise expiry- that was in the Labour manifesto too. I can't think of any other headlines (my bias, due to what interests me)- can you give any solid examples of where the two parties really diverged in a Left/Right way?

* I will throw in two or three SATA cables with the motherboard
* The CPU, motherboard, Noctua and PSU all come with their original boxes

Please feel free to give your best offer on any item. Nothing too cheeky please. I will sort postage out when I accept an offer. 

Thank you for looking!

Whaa...?!

I'll stress that ""he abstained"".

Definition:

&gt;***abstain** /əbˈsteɪn/*
&gt;*verb*
&gt;*2. formally decline to vote either for or against a proposal or motion.*

He didn't give his views public influence and didn't vote dishonestly by promoting conflicting interests. He never manoeuvred his vote for PR. Would you rather he defied his conscience and voted dishonestly? He didn't impose on others or himself for others. That's not imposing. That's the most mutually liberal position he could take. It would be cruel to expect him to defy his own morality when he has already compromised by not imposing it/by abstaining.

&gt;*But when it came down to it, he abstained from supporting gay marriage because of his religious beliefs. **He chose not to vote to let people choose whether to marry, based on their own beliefs.** He chose to impose his religious based opinions on others.*

So he never gave his views influence. That's not imposing. It's completely the opposite and no, the opposite of him imposing is not pushing the disagreed with's views onto him. Like you expect and are suggesting. The opposite of imposing is not imposing like how the opposite of love is indifference, and not hate. You go on to refute yourself here with the finishing passage:

&gt;*But when it came down to it, he abstained from supporting gay marriage because of his religious beliefs. He chose not to vote to let people choose whether to marry, based on their own beliefs. **He chose to impose his religious based opinions on others.***

Some of your points I agree with: Climate change could well be a biggie as could antibiotics. There's something badly wrong with London property prices and we're heading for something big there though what that will be I have no idea. There's still plenty of places with affordable property though not necessarily where everyone wants to live. Diminishing fossil fuels will be an issue if we don't have something else in place but there are plenty of alternatives. As for the 'increasing influence of fundamentalist religion' I can only think of one you could be referring to. In Britain at least, religion (at least formally practised) is on the decline and has been for years.

Some are on the petty side: This is one of the first generation where young people could consider owning a car. Insurance has always been high for young drivers. Primarily because they're much more likely to have an accident. The greater social pressures placed on young people? What do you mean? Are you referring to facebook? Yeah could be a problem but not up there with global warming! Double-edged sword that one. They've also got access to means of communication and information previous generations could only have dreamed of.

Some are just downright wrong: Unemployment is at 5% which is the lowest level in decades. People are flooding into the country for work. There's plenty of jobs. I'm wary of opening the NHS can of worms. 

As for the lessening value and increasing expense of a degree well IMO we've had far too much emphasis on people going to university. When everyone has a degree noone does.

It is much easier for a Limited Company to go bankrupt, the assets of the directors are protected.  Whereas if the bank need to foreclose on a property owned by a landlord in a personal capacity they know that: a) the landlord will be less willing to simply walk away, and b) if he doesn't, they can try and reclaim any shortfall from his personal assets.

null,false,Jimmni,null,null,null,"&gt; This is one of the first generation where young people could consider owning a car. 

Me, my brother and my sister all owned cars at 17/18. They were heaps of shit as we weren't a rich family, but we owned cars. So did both my parents, who grew up even poorer. I'd disagree with your assertion.

&gt; Insurance has always been high for young drivers.

When I looked into insurance for one of my ex's younger sister, the quoted prices were approximately 10x what I paid for my first year of insurance. That's well beyond inflation. This was on a similar value car. As a named driver on an older driver's car. I don't know what the proper numbers are, but I bet you'd be surprised.

&gt; Some are just downright wrong: Unemployment is at 5% which is the lowest level in decades.

These statistics are heavily massaged. And they don't take into account the quality of the job. Just as one personal example, when I got seriously ill, I was unable to work for over a year. As soon as I was well enough to do any work at all I found a couple of hours a week I could be doing. Just something to keep me from going insane, I physically couldn't do more. I was immediately classified as in gainful employment. When my mum had to stop work due to a serious health condition, she was pushed into a self-employment programme that classified her as in gainful employment.

Even when young people do find work, it's increasingly often low-paid apprenticeships that are barely jobs, or barely support them. Many have to take on unpaid apprenticeships in order to try to secure work in the field they studied in. This is only an option for those with rich parents.

As for rents, when I was a student I was paying £200 a month for my rent. I'll be impressed if there are many parts of the country where that's possible now. Even the cheapest university provided accommodation in the shitty city I live in is £300 a month (actually much less than I expected, tbh), and I'd be very surprised if it gets much cheaper than that. That's still £2,700ish a year in rent alone.

But I think we don't fundamentally disagree about much, we just seem to look at it with a different degree of pessimism.

The FSA was never a force of note, beyond the trumpeting they got in our press. The other groups e.g. Nusra Front were doing all of the fighting at the time, this was well known. Our leaders [knew all about ISIS at the time](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/focus/article1560083.ece). It fitted in perfectly with their intentions to create a “Salafist Principality” in East Syria. 

Eventually emails were forced to be released by FOI requests that proved that [this was known and fully understood at the time](http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pg.-291-Pgs.-287-293-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version11.pdf) we were giving them our full support, for example:

&gt;  “the Salafist, the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.” - DIA report, **August 2012**

thus **completely contracting** what our leaders were telling us. So it's not as if they were just making an innocent mistake regarding FSA's role, they knew full well the reality of the situation. 

Other releases documented things [such as the supply lines to them from other extremist groups](http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pgs.-1-3-2-3-from-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version1.pdf):

&gt; During the immediate aftermath of, and following the uncertainty caused by, the downfall of the ((Qaddafi)) regime in October 2011 and up until early September of 2012, weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles located in Benghazi, Libya were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the ports of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The Syrian ports were chosen due to the small amount of cargo traffic transiting these two ports. The ships used to transport the weapons were medium-sized and able to hold 10 or less shipping containers of cargo.

Other investigations into other sources of arms have proven links to US/Saudi and US/Qatari programs to arm them. Serial numbers of weapons found in ISIS hands have been traced back to these programs. Our other allies in Turkey have a long litany of accusations against them for directly supporting ISIS, something that also sits perfectly with their own issues and national interests. All of the governments accused of supplying them absolutely detest Assad and want him gone. 

The US and the other nations mentioned above have a long history of backing such groups. Many of the same literal people got full NATO support in Libya where we conducted an invasion and regime change for them. Backing groups like ISIS when we have a mutual enemy is pretty much the norm for us. Absolutely nothing here is surprising or unexpected in any way.

It's *okay* though because he didn't even try impose it. He protected his conscience without pushing it. An honest and liberal approach to a difficult (subjective) situation. I'll bluntly say that he has earned my respect.

**I'm all for gay couples getting married.**

However, I do recognise the opposition. The idea that only homophobes oppose is a very prejudicial attitude. I'm not accusing you suggest.

I'll best put the debate as a conflict of expression. It all boils down to a different concept of marriage in which homosexuals can't comply. Marriage isn't all about love and commitment to some people and sex is neither. Take reproduction for example. Gay couples can't impregnate each other and thus can't reproduce. That isn't about being gay by itself. It's about the physicalities of it which one can't call unfairly attributed. After all homosexuals,  by very definition, are about being attracted to the same sex in which particular practices are implied.

My point is that it's about surely similar, but different concepts sharing the same word. Different enough for some conflict. I wish more realised this. Not suggesting you don't. Arguments are too often misrepresented.

2. Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?
3. How do you think the team will line up?

- I think this season will be a bit of a surprise. Even with offloading 5/6 squad players and selling our two stars, I think the players brought in will help us to a 12-14 place finish. However, this all depends on the striker we bring in. If we manage to pull in Austin or Destro *and* Embolo, we will be set. Kozak could also play a massive role in helping us out when he returns from injury. Also could hinge on the chemistry between Clark and Richards.

- Our player of the season will be between Clark (if he is captain), Gil, and our new striker (if he is good enough). Clark was immense for us last year and could be the voice and leadership we need to help us to a solid finish. He has the potential to be the reason we stay up this year. Gil has been playing more and more in this preseason, which is showing off his skills to Tim nicely. He has the flair, pace, and ability to create some moments of magic for us. ***IF*** we manage to pull in Destro, he could manage to score enough goals himself to make up for Benteke. If he does, he will be player of the season.

- IMO, we will be best defensively with Clark and Richards as our centre back partnership. Amavi is our obvious left back, and I hope we bring in another RB because Hutton is not good enough, and Bacuna is too attacking. Both Richards and Trippier have signed elsewhere, so I don't know who we can try for RB now.

    Carlos Sanchez had an incredible international break with Colombia, and that could be enough to give him the starting spot this year for Villa. We need a good covering DM, and Sanchez has stepped up his technical game recently too. Gueye will be one of our best this year. Consistent and hardworking. No chance he doesn't start. Westwood has also stepped up recently and his passing is incredible. He also has leadership qualities in midfield that could be really important.

    Grealish could be really important this year if he keeps improving like he is. He has flair, incredible touch, and he will be massive for us in the next few years. If we bring in Ljajic he could provide competition to Grealish, and Sinclair will always be in the mix too. Gil will be extremely important for us because of his passing and dribbling. Hopefully we bring in another good right winger to provide competition and rotation.

On the agressive cunts thing, that's definitely true. When people get agressive just mind your own bussiness and ignore them. It only gets worse by replying. Rotterdammers are also VERY proud on their city, more than any of city in the Netherlands  I think. So some people do get offended easily when bashing Rotterdam. But those are the extreme cases.

About Sparta: You can visit our stadium by grabbing tram 21, 23 or 24 going West. It takes like 10 minutes max from the central station so really nearby. (and than a 2 minutes walk) 

There is also Excelsior, who have got a tiny 3000 seater in the East. Maybe not as exciting, but also easily accessible with tram 21 or 24 going East.

If you assume the opposite (which is what we must do if we do not have evidence), that God doesn't exist, and that it is therefore impossible to transgress against his non existent divine law.

It's to make sure that emergency vehicles are able to access the hydrant easily and safely. If a wall of cars block the hydrant it slows down the time taken to set up the hose, and since the hose becomes straight when water is pumped through it you're going to have to run it through a parked car window if you're going across the street. This is simple stuff: don't make more work and more things that can go wrong when dealing with emergencies and fires.

&gt;As far as crossing the street at any point goes, I've had over 30 years of crossing wherever I like with no ill-effects so of course I'm not going to understand this ""jaywalking"" business

Having a road that shares both vehicle and perpendicular pedestrians creates both hazards to pedestrians (getting hit by cars that don't see them or can't slow down in time) and slows cars down. It's both more efficient (for vehicle traffic) and safer (for pedestrians) to have designated crossings, and there are a lot of them. 

&gt;the law is a foreigner-tax

City planners don't care about foreigners. I can assure you that the people who planned traffic laws were not thinking of you when they designed their cities any more than UK city planners were thinking of Americans when deciding where to put the traffic lights.

Just stop talking about the United States with any sense of authority. You're the equivalent of the dumb American who makes internet posts about how stupid the UK is despite having barely visited. Educate yourself first. If dumb Americans making arrogant comments about other countries is a stereotype, you're the Brit equivalent. Stay home.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24163392/?i=4&amp;from=/26010243/related 
This study tried to look at the reasons *why* mortality is higher at weekends. They found that for certain groups of people, there was no change in mortality and in others there was.

And while we are on the topic, we need to talk about relative vs absolute risk. This study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26010243/ found a crude 30 day mortality for weekday admissions to be 3.70% and 4.05% for weekend admissions. 

So of 1,000 patients admitted on a Friday, 370 would be dead within 30 days. Of 1,000 patients admitted on a Saturday, 405 would be dead within 30 days. 

The absolute risk increase is 0.35%, or 35 patients in a thousand. But the relative risk increase is 9.4%. If I wanted to sell newspapers, I could write a headline about being ""almost 10% more likely to die at weekends"".

If this is the ultimate goal then they will need to increase the budget. I'm assuming the UK government will increase the budget by so much (maybe 100m) every year (they just increased it by 100m recently) as a % of the industry growth. Space isn't as expensive as people think though, it's actually rather cheap for countries, it's just not profitable. And with NASA having it's budget cut ever more with the US government losing interest in space and with Russia's economy declining there will likely be cuts to it's $5bn program I think there is enough room for a new country to become the focus and it could be the UK, especially given it's scientific history.

* Cap private rents based on the council tax band and property value.  A one-bed ground floor flat on a Hackney sink estate is not worth £1500pcm, sorry

* Rent adjustments should be restricted to once per tax year

* Tax rental income much more harshly

* An absolute ban on BTL mortgage and loan products

* Ban on renting out properties that are currently subject to mortgages

* Residential property can only be owned in the name of fully named *UK based* individuals and not companies or trusts.  This would be enforced by NI numbers.  It would also be illegal for a British person to ""front"" for an offshore owner, i.e. Alexsandr Vladimirivich Billionairski in Moscow can't get Jane Smith to ""own"" a property on his behalf

If you make BTL a total pain in the arse, fewer people will want to do it.  Many landlords may choose to sell up which increases the supply for those wanting to buy.

People generally don't tend to distinguish between concentration and internment camps as usually they perform the same function- it's just a different name for the same phenomenon. The prisoner camps in the U.S. Civil war were widely used, and often systematic in their abuses. For example, largely in retribution for atrocities at Andersonville, the Union Camp '40 Acres of Hell' carried out systematic abuse of confederate soldiers. Over 600,000 soldiers during the war were interned in mass camps.

Interestingly these weren't even the first significant internment camps in the U.S., as President Van Buren systematically forced the Cherokee into such camps in places such as Fort Cass, as part of the Trail of Tears.

The Spanish too used such camps when fighting in Cuba, referring to the policy as ""reconcentrado"", which predates the English use of 'concentration camp' by a few years.

It's basically a myth that the British invented the concept, although of course they definitely used them in the Boer war.

What are they going to do when they have information, say on a scandal, which could threaten their careers and/or holdings but is of crucial public interest? Are they going to come forward when there is a conflict of interest in their work? Are they going to be honest and principled in the claiming of expenses?

Do you seriously think a person driven by money can ever be a politician with integrity?

They have five years' job security so long as they keep their noses clean, or otherwise hide how dirty their noses are from the public. I don't know about you but a five year job contract is more job security than anyone I've ever met has. Avoiding scandal, and in a safe seat, a politician can be utterly lousy, with next to no attendance in parliament, and still have a job for life. You can even hire your own family, paying them with taxpayer money as happens routinely.

2) ""*I'm certain he'll fail*"" -- congratulations, you have an opinion. Stop treating that opinion as fact. 

3) Benteke's scoring record -- the author of this dreadful piece looks at how many goals Benteke has scored. He concedes that 23 in his first season is good, but cannot understand why anyone would want him when he's had 11 and then 16 the following seasons. Well, firstly, up until last season, Villa were playing a unique brand of football that can be described as ""pure shite"". Under Lambert, they were the least attacking side in the PL, and had a very low amount of shots compared to the teams around them. So it's unfair to claim that 11 goals is terrible when your team is not set up to create chances. Secondly, the author then mentions that he'd rather Lacazette...but let's not forget that, before last season, he'd only scored 3 and then 5 goals at Lyon. He literally *only* started scoring last season, so that, by this author's logic, is not enough to warrant us being in for him.

It's bollocks. It's written by someone who thought we should sign Benzema and is angry that we haven't. ",null,0,null,1437243822,null,0,false,0,ct7vo3p,null,t3_3dr2j3,null,t1_ct7vo3p,null,t3_3dr2j3,null,null,null,1437972002,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

However, a lot of people in my work are very racist and I hate hate hate it. The other day I was part of a conversation where several people said they would refuse to get in a taxi if the driver was wearing a turban or non-white (they used racial slurs for that). I told them I thought they were wrong but they are all senior to me in work and we work very close together, so arguing too much or telling them to stop being racist scum would make work so uncomfortable. I've considered reporting them (for more than just this occasion too) but it feels like I am the only one with the opinion that racism is wrong and if it came down to it, it would be the word of a 10 year+ manager against a 2 year admin (me).

It's about ordinary law enforcement. A huge number of criminal investigations rely on being able to access things like phone records, email correspondence, SMS messages, etc. Both of victims (with their permission) and suspects (with appropriate warrants).

We are moving towards a society where all communication is encrypted and untraceable by default. This will render a large number of crimes completely uninvestigable and significantly impede the investigation of many others.

Personally, I find that pretty scary. Police should be able to access communication records with appropriate judicial authority (warrants).

There are many more people who would much rather vote Labour/Conservative/Libdem/etc  than for the SNP. I do doubt there will be any real support UK wide. Even getting somewhere around 50% (or more) of the votes in Scotland, it translated as under 5% of the national vote share. Around 3/4 of the vote share was for parties that were very against the SNP (Con/Lab/LibDem/UKIP).

In order to spray water onto a fire from a hydrant, the water has to be under incredible pressure. That pressure straightens the hose when in use. You can't curve it around objects.

&gt;or why more British houses don't burn down due to people parking in front of hydrants.

It's a very basic idea: don't complicate things or create potential problems when dealing with emergencies, such as fires. Leaving the fire hydrant clear makes it easier and faster for firefighters to access the hydrant, saving time and in the long-run lives. This is very basic stuff. Spend a day working as a firefighter in any country and you'll realize how annoying and dangerous it can be to have to waste time going around vehicles when there is a raging fire across the street.

&gt;As far as crossing the road goes, we have plenty of designated crossings too and people tend to use them when there's vehicular traffic because people tend to dislike being hit by cars.

It's the same in the US, except that you aren't supposed to jaywalk. As I said before, it's largely unenforced unless you're doing it in a busy location with police nearby. I've explained the reasoning before, and again it's very basic stuff. 

&gt;Oh, and do notice that I haven't insulted you once during this little exchange

No, you've only acted with an entirely undeserved arrogance combined with ignorance. You are the equivalent of the stupid American stereotype, the one who says how dumb it is that British laws are X and Y and that everyone should be doing it like ""we"" do, etc. I called you out on that and you're still going on about how American laws are stupid and how they should be the same as they are where you come from.

&gt;I'm not wandering into /r/askUSA and claiming they're wrong about everything.

Yet you're making authoritative comments on how the US is and how it should be - based on your own ignorance - in /r/askUK. Stick to what you know and be silent about what you don't - you don't understand American laws, you've clearly never thought about the reasoning behind them, yet you're the first one to tell everyone how stupid they must be. This is /r/askUK, you're British, you don't understand or know the United States, so don't try and make authoritative statements about the US. You'll notice I've done likewise and made no comments about the UK at all.

&gt;***I don't think abstaining from voting on gay marriage is very pro choice** considering that the reason behind it was religiously bias.*

Isn't it though? He never gave his personal views public influence. He let, to the best of his ability, others decide for themselves. He neither imposed or let himself be imposed on. He essentially remained neutral to give others a choice while protecting his conscience. How could it have been more liberal? He remained honest in his vote.

&gt;*I don't think abstaining from voting on gay marriage is very pro choice **considering that the reason behind it was religiously bias.***

I believe liberal by definition makes a point on acceptance and respect. I don't think it's very accepting to refuse him on the point of belief. You're arguing religious bias and so in retaliation, I'll argue non religious bias. You're attributing illiberalism to the fact that he's religious which considering we don't know the specifics of I, seems religion is so widely open to interpretation, don't think is a valid point. He may believe in a God where the respective teachings are just a value guide. He may believe in each recording to the word in which you may argue poor minded. Liberalism, in which he was elected to represent, doesn't have to conflict with his understandings of Christianity in which he has made evidence of. I'm by far as you can get not religious, but still, it doesn't make him not accepting, respecting or incompetent.

Liberalism isn't about minorities conforming to popular views. It's a two way street in that you and I should accept him from the (seemingly) majority and measure by his actions. He, in return, should too. He couldn't have been more liberal. If he voted dishonestly that would be self imposing which is conscientiously authoritarian and anything but liberal.

Even atheists are subject to bias and belief. I'm sure you hold a set of principles which are based on understanding of life. Me too. We can't dismiss him purely of off which category, besides life, that bias lies. In which I, personally, think is happening. After all, with us each being subject to a different window to a snippet of reality, we all have different perspectives and angles on both different and common things. Yet we are all still lacking.

DISCLAIMER: Work at Barclays (Fraud) and I'm not sure how much of this is confidential (I will delete once the info is used).

A BTL is a 'Branch Transaction Log', essentially it is an internal process and what it means is that a pending payment has been put on the account which means future payments will not go out, its a huge amount (i.e. in the hundreds of thousands, enough to prevent the account from doing anything, obviously if the account has millions in then it will be bigger) but it does not actually mean that the account is in debt. It is very likely to be the result of a fraud case, a BTL is put on a suspicious account to prevent money from being taken out or for transfers to occur. It is also possible that a BTL was placed on in error but knowing the process for it it is unlikely. The staff SHOULD have been able to tell you what a BTL is (although they would have to be discrete about it, because of tipoffs like NoizeUK says), I'm surprised at this, although it does depend on their experience.

Other facts to possibly clear up some misinformation:

You will be entitled to withdraw benefit money, we have had some issues with customers not being able to because branch staff believe blocks are blocks, but you definitely can, if the other money in the account is also benefits they have to let you have it as well (its easy to see if that's the case).

There are limits to what can be done, processes have to be followed. Yes I agree that you should raise complaints with Barclays but the FOS should not be your first point of contact. In fact we usually recommend you raise a complaint, especially in this sort of case. 

The branch staff are not just put through to 'an Indian call centre', the offshore guys are usually great at what they do and the sheer numbers we need mean it makes sense.

To the OP:

German expat banker tells countrymen: don't send your kids to 'disappointing' British private schools - Telegraph


Arnold Holle, 50, an investment banker originally from Dusseldorf who has lived in the affluent London suburb of Primrose Hill with his banking analyst wife Denise, 50, for the past 21 years, and whose four children all attend top public schools in England, lambasted England's boarding schools.

In an article for German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung under the headline “Top English boarding schools disappoint”, Mr Holle wrote that extensive experience of his adopted country’s private school system and being “well on the way to putting a seven-figure sum into the English public school system” has robbed him of his illusions.

• Record numbers of foreign pupils at UK schools

“It is said time and time again, how paradisiacal and in every respect advantageous English boarding schools are,” he wrote.

“My conclusion so far: not everything that glitters is gold, not by a long chalk. ”

Considering the great sums of money parents fork out in the expectation of a top-quality education, Mr Holle said students at the UK’s top boarding schools fare little better, if at all, than receiving a free education in Germany.

Arnold Holle (Facebook)

“The great strength of the English schools and students is the self-presentation,” said Mr Holle, a managing director at the London office of investment bank Piper Jaffray. “But appearances are deceptive: even at the top English boarding schools, children don’t learn more than in Germany, probably less.

Mr Holle’s 18-year-old twin sons Adrian and Max and younger son Constantine, 14, all attended The Hall, a leading boys prep school in Belsize Park, north west London, which commands fees of almost £6,000 a term.

The twins went on to study at Sevenoaks School, another of the UK’s top independent schools, where boarding fees exceed £11,000 a term. His 12-year-old daughter Antonia also attends a top school while Constantine is now at Westminster School, alma mater of Nick Clegg, AA Milne and Sir Christopher Wren, which charges similar fees.

The German banker also criticised the country’s boarding schools for cocooning students in a world of wealth and privilege.

Private school pupils (Alamy)

“Learning less and paying a lot is one thing,” he wrote. “Much worse, however, is that even a short stay in an English boarding school will lead to children losing any respect for money. How many chauffeurs are waiting today at parents' evenings in Germany in dark limousines at the school gate? In England there’s a lot.

“And on the last day before the autumn holidays, the plane from Heathrow to Mauritius always has a handful of students from ""The Hall"" on board. In addition, there are virtually no scholarship recipients at English boarding schools.”

In summary, he writes, “for parents in Germany, there are, in my opinion, better alternatives than a long stay in an English boarding school.

“But for our children, who have Westminster as the birthplace in each of their three passports, but feel primarily British, English boarding schools are the lesser evil. And we parents hand over the tussle over schoolwork, computer games, condoms and hashish pipes gladly for huge sums to the professionals.”

“All in all, no other Western country makes it more difficult for its underclass to rise upwards. The social injustice here in London cry out to the heavens. The school system is one of the main reasons that not only social mobility persists at a low level, but continues to decline every year.”

Mr Holle told the Telegraph that the purpose of his article was to “disabuse” people of the “fantastical notions” being circulated in Germany about the benefits of English public schools.

When asked why he decided to send his children to private schools in England, the banker explained that his wife’s American passport meant there were three nationalities in his family, replying: “I want my kids to be British first and foremost and if sending to private school is what it takes to give them the best chance, I don't want to rob them of an opportunity there.

""I want to send my kids to the best schools, end of story.""

However, he told the Telegraph he regretted that his children won’t be able to share his own school experiences in Dusseldorf of meeting people from all walks of life.

“I was with people whose parents were on television every night and other people where their father was manning a gas station till,” he said “That's an experience my son will never have. There's too few people in his school whose parents have a normal salary.

""My schooling provided me with an insight into how the other half lives. My kids don't get an insight into how the other half lives in their school. If they were in a German school they would have the chance to have an empathy for people whose parents don't send their children to Mauritius for the holidays.""

• Dozens of private schools fail in controversial new league tables

Would Mr Holle take his own advice on board about thinking twice before sending his children to an English boarding school if he and his family lived in Germany?

""Would I send them to the UK for a year? Maybe,” he said. “But with open eyes, and it would only be for a year.""

Robin Fletcher, National Director of the Boarding Schools' Association said: ""Parents choose UK boarding schools because they are widely regarded as being among the best schools in the world.

""At the heart of every boarding school is the philosophy to ensure that each child is happy, thrives and succeeds, regardless of their interests or talents. You can be certain that all boarding schools seek to help pupils achieve their full potential.

""British boarding schools provide outstanding and unrivalled educational opportunities, seven days a week for 75,000 students from more than 50 countries around the world, including Germany.""",null,0,null,1437246921,null,0,false,0,ct7xass,null,t3_3dpx0x,null,t1_ct7xass,null,t1_ct7pskf,null,null,null,1437972923,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

DISCLAIMER:

Work at Barclays (Fraud) and I'm not actually sure how much of this is confidential (I will delete once the info is used).

FIRST THINGS FIRST: You are not in debt, and this is a mistake IF you are not currently the subject of a fraud case.

A BTL is a 'Branch Transaction Log', essentially it is an internal process and what it means is that a pending payment has been put on the account which means future payments will not go out, its a huge amount (i.e. in the hundreds of thousands, enough to prevent the account from doing anything, obviously if the account has millions in then it will be bigger) but it does not actually mean that the account is in debt. It is very likely to be the result of a fraud case, a BTL is put on a suspicious account to prevent money from being taken out or for transfers to occur. It is also possible that a BTL was placed on in error but knowing the process for it it is unlikely that would happen. The staff SHOULD have been able to tell you what a BTL is, I'm surprised at this, although it does depend on their experience.

Other facts to possibly clear up some possible misinformation:

You will be entitled to withdraw benefit money, we have had some issues with customers not being able to because branch staff believe blocks are concrete, but you definitely can, if the other money in the account is also benefits they have to let you have it as well (its easy to see if that's the case).

There are limits to what can be done, processes have to be followed. Yes I agree that you should raise complaints with Barclays but the Financial Ombudsman Service should not be your first point of contact, it is supposed to be settled with the bank first and escalated. In fact we do usually recommend you raise a complaint, especially in this sort of case.

The branch staff are not just put through to 'an Indian call centre', the offshore guys are usually great at what they do and the sheer numbers we need mean it makes sense. We don't have staff only contact centres because there is no real point, and plus we have plenty of centres in the UK (I should know, I work with one). Calls from branch go offshore, if they can't handle it then it will come back here to a dedicated team, the only reason this can cause issues is if branch staff don't know who they need to contact. Don't think of it as ""the staff have to use the same centres as the customers"", but rather ""the customers will speak to the same agents as the other staff"".

To the OP:

My advice for you right now is (as long as you have enough money to last over the weekend) wait until Monday, there is not much that can be done at the moment. PM me or one of the others who have said they work at Barclays and we can provide plenty of information for you. Note down everything, and make sure you get names of people you've spoken to, and make sure when someone tells you something ask them to 'make a note of it', they'll know what it means and it makes it so much easier to keep track of what is going on. 

When you go in on Monday morning, you want to call our Northampton Fraud (just in case) contact centre on 0345 050 4585. Do it in branch and they will have the number, they will should be able to do more than what the branch staff can ESPECIALLY if it IS a fraud case, the branch staff don't have access to the case management systems we do, although we always leave notes to tell them of things going on sometimes we don't want the customer to know about them (this should not be one of them).",null,0,null,1437247218,null,0,1437337485,0,ct7xgam,null,t3_3djadw,null,t1_ct7xgam,null,t3_3djadw,null,null,null,1437973031,null,17,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,17,null

Yup. If you believed that the oil price at $116 was ""conservative"" and that it would be ""three times that"", you are exactly like those greedy folk who fall for the Nigerian scams. It tends to be pure greed that makes them fall for ""too good to be true"" stuff

It's also absolutely pointless Labour bothering to pander to the blood and soil ""uber alles"" nationalists. They just don't share our values. 

Our best bet is to force Scotland out of the Union - we no longer have a stake there, we don't represent the Scots, and as long as they cling on we won't win in England because of fears of the Natsy party being in govt.

We know Sturgeon will put in her manifesto the right to hold another referendum if England votes to leave the EU and that the Scots will give her a mandate for that in the 2016 Holyrood elections.

So we should campaign hard for a No in the EU referendum. A Scottish referendum will get triggered hopefully before the next election and they'll be out of our hair.

There's no such thing as a ""liberal view"". Liberalism is about the approach to your views. Liberalism is about holding any view providing that you don't impose, infringe and incite against the rights, views or welfare of others. Providing that it's mutual. It's about keeping your view from public influence; only to be practised with consensual parties. Of course consent's subjective which is why liberalism shouldn't exist in its purist.

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; Your argument is circular: BTL landlords have it easy because they have more money, and they have more money because BTL is so easy.

Not quite.  In fact I've said no fewer than four times that being a landlord is not easy, but it's is easier to meet the qualifications required if the landlord has a lot of (access to) money already.

And I didn't say that BTL is they reason they have the money, but being a long-term landlord can provide the resources: i.e. remortgaging existing properties to raise enough cash for a deposit on a new one.  But it's not the only way.

It's not actually that rare to have enough money to invest in Buy-to-Let.  Anyone with a professional job would easily be able to save for a BTL deposit, even if were for a property in a cheaper town; also: inheritance, foreign investors, etc.

But, either way, there's enough of them who have/can raise the required funds to be a significant proportion of activity in the housing market.

&gt; BTL was much less tax-friendly than owner-occupation, even before these recent changes, and now it's much, much worse.

How do you work that one out?  People paying for a house to live in, pay for it out of their post-tax income; people paying for a house to rent out, pay for it out of their pre-tax income.  The only benefit owner-occupiers get is a free-pass on capital-gains tax on their first property, which doesn't help in the competition for buying.

&gt; But despite that, BTL landlords won't suffer a jot, because they are rich.

Well, that depends on how you define ""rich"".  If it's ""has tens of thousands of pounds in cash to invest"", then yes, by definition they are rich.  If you mean ""rich"" as in ""can afford to lose these investments"", then no, not even close.

Some are that rich, of course, but many (perhaps even most) aren't.  The bootstrapped BTL empire will still have quite a high LTV on the whole estate.  Many got in to BTL after losing faith in their pension options, and need it to provide a retirement.  Many ""middle"" class people got into BTL simply because they don't know how ISAs work, but think they know what colour magnolia paint will magically add 10% to any property.

But either way ""suffer"" isn't a helpful way of looking at it.  I don't want to inflict pain on arbitrary sections of humanity.  I think the housing market needs sorting out to, well, actually make it function; and given how long these biases have been entrenched it's going to be very difficult to do it without causing pain, but pain is the not the motivator.  If these semi-mythical overseas property investors just shrug their shoulders and fly off in their golden helicopters, so be it, that's cool with me.

&gt; The fundamental core of your complaint is not about BTL, but about growing inequality in our society. I totally agree with you that is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Messing around with BTL tax arrangements isn't going to do that though.

Inequality in society is very much a bad thing, for a whole host of reasons.  But I do also have specific issues against BTL, which include, but are not limited to, the effect it has on equality.

And as I said in my first comment in this comment-tree, the near-term issue is the fact it's easier for a BTL (appropriately financed, not necessarily rich) landlord to buy property than an owner-occupier.  And the increased cost of working in this cornered market causes an economic drag (reduction in disposable income, across all classes) generally, as well as the cost to the individuals.  Ultimately this is a risk to the housing market itself, speculation alone cannot enact permanent change in a market.

Anything that increases the cost of being a landlord is therefore part of the solution.  A greater tax burden is welcome.  There's still more to do of course: having some form of rapid independent-but-binding dispute process would flush out the less-scrupulous landlords, which would improve the stock of housing generally (and help owner-occupiers and other landlords as it ought to prevent the slum-districts[0] that are cropping up in even wealthy areas).

So, if you believe inequality is bad that needs to be addressed.  Where would you start?

[0] - every town has at least one.  An area near the station and next to noisy infrastructure (like the accompanying railway line).  Every house is now three flats; gardens are overgrown, paint is flaking, etc.  But people are in denial about it because when they do sell they still fetch between £500,000 to £1,000,000 (to a landlord, obviously, as no sane person would spend that much to live in such a hovel for potentially many, many years).",null,0,null,1437248015,null,0,false,0,ct7xueh,null,t3_3dpwzz,null,t1_ct7xueh,null,t1_ct7wk7o,null,null,null,1437973350,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You go to that link, click on the Live Extra button and choose something that is live at the moment to watch, golf or whatever, doesn't matter. Then it will ask you to choose your TV provider. Here is where you need your parents' or friends account info. For example, my father has Dish, so I clicked Dish on the options that appeared, then it asks for the Dish acct info. I called him and got his info (after I reassured him there were not going to be any charges to his account), entered it into the boxes on the next screen, it verified that it was a valid account, and boom, in like Flynn. Today I watched my first game on it, the Arsenal-Everton match, and it was glorious. All HD, perfectly streamed, in English, with no problems. They have the entire PL season, I'm so stoked. And like I said before, it's free as long as you have a valid TV account somewhere. Oh, and they also have an app for your smartphone or tablet for NBC Live Extra as well.

The case is a long shot, but failing that, I'd take any nice looking white case with a side panel window. 

I'll be paying via PayPal as usual, or I can collect from Sheffield.

null,false,Sheafer,null,null,null,"That's an interesting definition of Liberalism. Maybe that's what we should actually be talking about... What exactly does it mean, and what exactly do we are a group believe government is for? As I said in the title comment - I think the party's strength is a founding philosophy that still applies. It's the Tories strength too, incidentally, and the lack of it is Labour's current weakness. But perhaps exactly who we are isn't as clearly defined as we all think. 

For me, being a Liberal in politics fundamentally means that you feel the role of government is to maximise freedom - while (unlike libertarians, which is the direction the Tories lean) we do not equate a maximisation of freedom with a lack of constraint. So, in practice, that means we are willing to significantly tax (and therefore constrain) to provide free and good education, healthcare, adequate defence, social aid, etc. But we do these things to provide equal opportunity, not equality. The centerist claim the party legitimately can make isn't economic, it isn't even social. In both those cases party policy has us generally far more progressive than either Labour or the population as a whole (see drugs policy, trident, restorative justice, inward migration, Europe, etc.). Where we are 'central' is between rights on the one hand, and responsibilities on the other, with the two main parties representing the relative extremes of these positions. The opportunity to create a life you find meaningful has to be coupled with you being responsible for taking, or not, that opportunity. 

In my view the party doesn't take this position to a nearly radical enough place when it comes to either social or economic policy - but in any case, I really want a platform that is consistent, and philosophically sound... And which people understand as such.

null,false,49_Giants,flair8,,null,"From a relatively new Spurs fan in the US:

For me, becoming a Spurs fan was a very strange thing.  I was born, raised, and live in San Francisco, CA and all of my sports allegiances were lifelong and natural--the Gians, the 49ers, the Warriors.  That is to say, I had no choice.  It never even occurred to me that one could choose which team they support--in a sense, we are all born into various fiefdoms and our loyalties are a birthright (or curse).  This is why I could never, ever understand frontrunners or bandwagoners or fair-weather fans who are somehow able to switch allegiances depending on which way the wind was blowing.  Such mercenaries can not, and should not ever be trusted.  

And then about 8, 9 years ago, after a couple decades of merely watching World Cups, I decided to follow soccer in the in-between years.  Because of the common-ish language and being the top league, an EPL team was the natural choice.  But picking a team was anything but.  

The only team names that I even recognized were United, Chelsea, Liverpool, and arsenal.  To me, that mean they were automatically eliminated.  In the US, across various sports, we have the equivalents of those clubs--teams that are so well-known and popular and draw fans that should have no affiliation with them on any level.  The Yankees, the Lakers, the Cowboys, etc.  From my experience with those types of fans, I knew the traditional Big 4 in the EPL would likely have the same.  

Eventually, after some research, calculations, meditation, and alcohol, I decided on Spurs.  That they had a loose affiliation with my local MLS team, the San Jose Earthquakes, was the clincher.  However tangential, I need to have a local rooting interest.  

That being said, I knew my support was contrived.  It happened unnaturally and it felt very weird.  I was supporting a team that I couldn't talk to anyone about (very few of my friends follow soccer, and none follow Spurs), a team that played thousands of miles away, a team with a culture of which I was not a part, a team that played on grounds that I had never visited, and so on and so forth.  It was entirely unlike my experience with my lifelong teams.  But I also knew that I couldn't switch.  I was stuck and so I stuck with it.  

And I'm glad I did.

The cons of following Spurs are obvious.  Spurs are surprisingly the butt of many jokes.  Being ""Spursy"" is apparently a thing.  Spurs seem to be synonymous with mediocrity--never terrible, never great, always middling.  Spurs are known to be a selling club--they find and incubate great talent...and then sell them.  And the talent that they do buy are rarely, if ever, the big, big names.  Another strange con about being a Spurs fan: if you say you're a big club, you get laughed at.  Spurs aren't United or Barca or Bayern Munich or Juventus.  But if you try to play up the underdog status and say you're a small club, you're also laughed at.  Again, Spurs are in the middle.  

But, to me, the pros far outweigh the cons.  There are no bandwagon Spurs fans.  Whenever people learn that I follow soccer, they will inevitably respond with ""Me too! Chelsea is sick!""  and I smile and say yeah, they're ok--I follow Tottenham.  Those who have never heard of Spurs quiet down and those who have look at me with a bemused face, wondering how did that ever happen?  For me, supporting a team that does not have casual observers saying ""Tottenham, woohoo!"" is a huge pro.  

Another pro: I like to suffer.  It's not fun at the time, but in retrospect, that's what fandom is to me.  For the first half of my life, the 49ers won 5 Super Bowls.  I thought that's how it was always going to be.  But then it just...stopped.  And they became an irrelevant entity in the NFL for the next 15 years.  The Giants are probably the closest analog to Spurs, for me.  My entire life, they've had pretty good seasons, the rare almost great season, and so many average seasons.  And the Warriors, they were always shit.  Those years in the wilderness harden you.  You become chiseled into a real fan, unswayed, unmoved.  To me, to be a fan is to suffer.  

And then the final pro: the hope.  The Giants won the World Series.  After years of mediocrity and heartbreak and heartburn, they won the World Series and San Francisco exploded.  We danced in the streets and we drank in the streets and then we burned the streets down.  And then they won the World Series again.  And they won it again.  Fans jumped on the bandwagon, yes.  And fuck it, they're welcome on as far as I'm concerned.  But for us, the ones who were always there, we knew what we had been through which is why it meant so much more for us.  

And the Warriors.  After decades of quite possibly being literally the worse team in the NBA, caught lightning in a bottle this year and somehow lifted the trophy and put rings on their fingers.  We polished that turd and turned that motherfucker in a goddam diamond.  

All those years of shaking our heads at the end of all those seasons, after all those years of talking about what pieces we needed to collect to get a winning squad out there, after all those years of losing but hoping had finally paid off.  

Seventh, sixth, fifth place?  Yeah, I'll take it.  No one will ever accuse a Spurs fan of a being a gloryboy.  No one will ever accuse you of being too cute with your support of a League 1 club either.  It's middling, yes, but it's also within striking distance.  There's hope.  

And when Spurs lift that trophy one day, I'll dance and drink in the streets of San Francisco alone if I have to, and then I'll burn it down.

The Employment Appeals Tribunal in Pulse Healthcare Ltd v Carewatch Care Services Ltd &amp; Ors (2012) determined that employment contracts must reflect the true nature of the employment. Zero hour contracts are meant to be a casual arrangement to enable employers to cater for changing levels of demand. However if a worker on a zero hour contract regularly works the same hours, then their employment contract reflects this, regardless of what their written contract states.

Having worked the same regular shifts for 6 months, it is likely that your true employment contract is not a zero hour contract. A regular hour employment contract gives you greater statutory employment rights than a zero hour contract.

There is the BBC admitting that between 2008 and 2012, for four of the five years, Scotland was subsidising the rUK, and only one when it went the other way. Sorry the facts didn't fit your narrative. 

As for my conversion, for one, I'll be moving to England, and I'm left wing, so my choices are LD, green and Labour. I will never vote LD because of their tuition fees lies. The Greens put me off for three reasons 1) they ignore science on issues like GMOs and nuclear, both of which I consider to be incredibly important, 2) they are now a SJW party, with Bennent using terms like mansplaining and backing unequal prison terms by gender, and 3) because they seem to have a very poor grasp on their own maths. That leaves me with Labour, who contain a lot of good but also a lot of bad, and as the largest of those 3, the least likely to change because I got involved. But they are my only hope, so I've signed up and will be pushing as hard as I can to get the good improved and curtail the bad. 

So the question is, would I still support the SNP if I lived in Scotland? Yes and no. I would support them at holyrood, but not at Westminster. I had hoped that England would like the idea of a SNP-Lab coalition. Having analysed the results, I now believe I was wrong to have thought that - middle England, rightly or wrongly, did not want the SNP in government. 

I am a realist, not an idealist. What I want is a left wing government, and Id far rather have an okay left government that a perfect left party that was in opposition, so now I'm moving to labour. I am here because I think I can tell you how to win back Scotland. I can't believe you don't want to listen to what I have to say.

Particularly for the second idea you mention. It just won't happen.

I'm not sure it's practical but I think a salary cap could work. Iit would have to be applied pretty much globally, using some kind of GDP PPP type system, considering income tax etc etc... and that's where the problems lie. If someone came up with a fair method (that clubs could agree on) to assess what the limits should be in each FIFA member nation, considering FIFA's monopoly on football revenue, it could be done.

How do we compare purchasing power, tax differences, currency strength etc? Cost of living is lower in the US, but the currency is weaker and they pay less tax...

As for your question about Amsterdam: You really should hire a bike and just cycle around the city. I also would look for a tourist fessel, to discover the canals. As for museums and things like that; I really like the Stedelijk Museum (http://www.stedelijk.nl/en) or foam (http://www.foam.org/nl/home). If you want to shop, I would really go and check ""De Negen Straatjes"" out. It's like a shopping area with some really nice shops, from Episode to a antique barbershop. You also can find the Marqt there, which is a supermarket but with a more special vibe and all organic stuff. You should also really really try pancakes, the traditional Dutch food. A restaurant called The Pancake Factory has the best one in town, but go there during lunchtime. In the evening you have to stand in line to get a table. We have also something called the pancake boat, where you can eat pancakes while sailing.

 Try not to go where all the other tourists go, like the Anne Frank house or the Rijksmuseum or any hotspot. It's nice to see and all, but especially during the summermonths, the only thing you will be seeing are other tourists.   If you want a quiet day, you can also go to Utrecht of Haarlem. These are cities that are really near Amsterdam (like a half an hour train ride), look very similair, but without the tourist.

This site has the best tips for tourists in Amsterdam! http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting

With a BTL they have to override the fact that there is not enough money in the account to put an internal payment of £1,000,000 (for example) which in turn prevents any account activity (the customer can't override it), we do it all the time if there has been an error in credits (fraud refund miscalculated for example) and we have to remove the lot, then put it back in.

For example (you probably get it anyway but I'll leave this here) you have had a pre-credit of £10,000 into your account (from zero) for some fraudulent transactions, you have been spending that money as you normally would so you only have £5,000 in the account. Unfortunately the amount was miscalculated and is actually £12,000, we have to (its the process) remove the initial £10,000 (to make the accounting easier later). Except you can't remove what isn't there, so you override, force the account £5,000 overdrawn and then place the £12,000 in to bring the balances up to what is correct.

What's sad about this is that by objective measures, it's not true. Until the crash and recession Labour kept the debt below 40% of GDP. Out of the seven years that there was a budget surplus, since the end of the war, three were under Labour. Brown actually ran a very conservative fiscal policy until he got side-swiped by the crash. Then he was the only world leader who understood what was going on and organised a global response that stopped it turning into a massive global depression. The fact that Labour lost control of the message over the economy - and undid all the careful work that Brown had done as chancellor to build up credibility - is by far their biggest mistake and it's going to keep costing them for years to come.",null,0,null,1437252423,null,0,false,0,ct800z3,null,t3_3drnx7,null,t1_ct800z3,null,t3_3drnx7,null,null,null,1437975218,null,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45,null

The companies still need workers - either they will pay more or they will relocate (which will help the areas outside of London which are currently subsidising London via Housing Benefit) or the businesses will fail (a good thing in my opinion - a business that cannot afford the true costs of it's work force is not a viable business).

The problem is supply - we have to increase the supply of housing. And increasing council housing is one way - but another is simply to remove the incredibly restrictive planning legislation we have in this country (it's very easy for NIMBYs to block development and planning permission is by far the most expensive parts in the process - land with planning permission is far, far, far more expensive than land without).

In fact The Economist discussed about how it distorts the whole property market as companies compete at the level of getting land with planning permission rather than at the more elastic level of the actually quality of the houses they build.

The Nazi party, despite loosing votes, still had a larger number of supporters than any other party in Germany at that time, although they were still far from having a majority.

Also, the final German Federal Election was on 5th March 1933, it took till the 24th of March for the Enabling Act to pass through the Reichstag and Reichsrat and to be signed by President Hindenburg.

September 1930  - They had 24.53% of the vote and had 143 seats out of 577.

July 1932            - They had 37.27% of the vote and had 230 seats out of 608.

November 1932   - They had 33.09% of the vote and had 196 seats out of 584.

March 1933         - They had 43.91% of the vote and had 288 seats out of 647.

I do agree though that the final German Federal Election under the Weimar Republic was a complete farce due to banning and sabotage of opposition parties and voter intimidation.

Similarly they stick to austerity measures despite low gilt rates making it a very attractive time for government borrowing (and there are many areas such as education and health that could benefit from investment, and infrastructure investment like the internet and trains).

FWIW-- a plastic fan by my definition is anyone who claims to support a team for reasons other than the football itself.

Literally never watched them play a game, but started talking shit to me as a spurs supporter because he was 'supposed to'.

I have a coworker who supports City because he liked their kit when he saw it on the rack at a sporting goods store-- it reminded him of Tar Heel blue (the UNC color).  He loves UNC, even though he went to a shitty public school in Virginia, because he's a shitty sports fan.

You'll be charged maximum £50 a month for your accommodation (depending what state it's in). 

Meals are no more than £2 each (£6 a day). Depending on where you're based its either ""pay as you dine"" or it comes out of your wages. 

There really aren't many other charges to consider. Stuff like washing powder and haircuts I guess. 

My advice is:

Don't be one of those guys that gets a ridiculously expensive car on finance or lease and pay £350 a month for it. 

Get a diesel car that's reliable and gets good mileage/low tax all of the usual stuff. 

Pay things like car insurance as a one off payment. You'll take the hit for that month and have less money but there's no way you'll starve and the lads will help you out with beer tokens. You'll pay less in the long run. 

If you're based miles from home, try not to get a girlfriend in your hometown. That's a lot of fuel money a year and it's only going to end in tears. 

Buy a phone outright and get a one month, low price rolling contract. £45 a month for shitty signal on every camp sucks. 

Watch your spending on nights out. It's easy to spend WAY too much on payday early on because you feel rich. Waking up with an empty bank account and a heavy sense of shame gets old quickly. 

Speak to the financial guys that always appear on camp from time to time. The majority actually know what they are on about and can save you money. 

On payday, put as much as you physically can into a savings account. Treat it as if you never had that money. You're quality of life won't suffer that much because barracks life is the same for everyone whether you've got a Ferrari or a Ford Fiesta, a 4k TV or a laptop. You don't need that shit. 

There are no other jobs where you get paid this much disposable income. Save it and treat yourself every now and then. 

I managed to save £20k in two years and I wasn't even living that frugally. 


Also, volunteer for stuff abroad or off camp or wherever it is ESPECIALLY tours. You get paid more and the amount of days you ""earn"" for being away goes up incrementally.

HG Mould Spray will keep the mould away for a long time as they put something special in their formula.

Ask the landlord if they'll pay for the bottle if you give them a receipt (it is tax deductable for them).

If you are thinking of getting a dehumidifier get a Meaco DD8L or EcoAir DD122MK5 as these have anti-bacterial filters as well as an ioniser.

Ionisers fuse negative ions with positive ones. The ions then become too heavy to float in the air and fall into the dehumidifier or onto the ground ready to be hoovered up.

As to the general sci-fi trope you mentioned, I thought about that the other day after ruminating on this post. And yes, it's seen in SO MUCH of the best sci-fi out there, which is probably one of the reasons I've always been so drawn to the genre. That being said, some stories/shows/films/franchises seem to embrace it more wholeheartedly and unapologetically than others. In Who there is virtually no room whatsoever for the ""mysteries"" of magic or unknowable supernatural forces (I'm at a loss to think of any, and if you can point me in the direction of some I'd be happy to get you thoughts). EVERYTHING has an explanation, and finding that explanation is often the Doctor's primary goal in a given story.

This leads me to think of a friend who loves sci-fi but could never fully embrace Star Trek TNG solely because of Q (who I personally happen to love). He feels like Q's unexplained omniscience and omnipotence is too close to some sort of god-like conception, which threw a real wrench in the SCI half of the FI whole. And when you think about it, a character like Q has never—and most likely will never—exist in Who, because the show just doesn't meddle in the unexplained (or, at the very least, unexplainable). 

This also makes me think of Battlestar, and while I consider it one of the greatest sci-fi franchises in recent history it REALLY goes off the rails whenever it tries to incorporate thoughts on ""GOD"" or spirituality (oh how dreadfully rotten were the fruits those branches produced).

Owner occupiers do not have to pay Capital Gains Tax, that's a huge benefit.

Mortgage interest relief never gave landlords an advantage. It's just the normal way business expenses can be offset against profits.[1] Now that relief is limited, landlords are at a further (albeit minor) disadvantage. Wealthier landlords can simply incorporate to eliminate that disadvantage of course, so this measure is really nothing but a subsidy to the accounting profession.

[1] - If you don't agree (and I'm sure you don't), then try this thought experiment: If the ability to claim mortgage interest relief gives landlords an advantage over owner-occupiers, then you ought to be able to contrive a way for two home-owning neighbours to profit from swapping houses, and letting to each other.

&gt;For me, being a Liberal in politics fundamentally means that you feel the role of government is to maximise freedom - while (unlike libertarians, which is the direction the Tories lean) we do not equate a maximisation of freedom with a lack of constraint. So, in practice, that means we are willing to significantly tax (and therefore constrain) to provide free and good education, healthcare, adequate defence, social aid, etc. But we do these things to provide equal opportunity, not equality. The centerist claim the party legitimately can make isn't economic, it isn't even social. In both those cases party policy has us generally far more progressive than either Labour or the population as a whole (see drugs policy, trident, restorative justice, inward migration, Europe, etc.). Where we are 'central' is between rights on the one hand, and responsibilities on the other, with the two main parties representing the relative extremes of these positions. The opportunity to create a life you find meaningful has to be coupled with you being responsible for taking, or not, that opportunity. 

This is very much view, and has been for some time. Constraints like regulations on working hours or emissions ultimately provide a greater downstream level of freedom. In certain countries this can be true for things like Holocaust denial laws - but here in the British Isles certainly not.

Ultimately, social democrats in Europe have been too focused on equality of results - everyone can go to university, everyone can own a house. At the end of the day, we must strive for equality of opportunity, while realising some people (most, in the case of university) have to have other ambitions in life.

There's not a lot you can do about that. I mean it's complete bollocks, but the argument is so well ingrained after 5 years of refusing to oppose it that there's not a lot you can do.

The Tories will ALWAYS be more credible on the economy in some people's minds, *because they are Tories*. Labour can't counteract this. 

What they can do is try and use fact to refute the nonsense coming from the Tories, and they can attack the Tories on their own economic failings (missing target after target for deficit reduction, flatlining growth, poor exports, low productivity), but ultimately ""you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into"".",null,0,null,1437254922,null,0,false,0,ct81ard,null,t3_3dmef3,null,t1_ct81ard,null,t1_ct7l5b5,null,null,null,1437976232,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

If the claim is remotely true then expect Labour to suddenly find their Proportional Representation voice again.  Better to co-rule by rainbow coalition than to be relegated to obscurity.

If Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, UKIP, Greens all supported a private members bill you'd only a need a small handful of Tory backbenchers to back it - and there are despite what some people think still some Conservatives of principle left.

If Labour promised as the larger sibling to put proper proportional representation on the table as their key policy, to champion smaller parties on their behalf, and then to force a general election re-run under the next system, I suspect they'd win both handsomely.  At the very least they'd be able to more readily form a coalition - but I'd suspect we could even get enough rebel Conservatives to force it through as a Private Members Bill in this parliament.

That's correct - the environment officer doesn't make ""beyond reasonable doubt"" judgements like a court.  To issue an FPN the case against you must meet what is called the ""threshold test"" - that is, there must be enough evidence available to offer a reasonable chance of conviction, even if it hasn't all been gathered yet.  The testimony of an officer will almost always be enough to convict you.

&gt;would they take the time and effort to track me down on the littering offence or would the police issue a warrant?

There's a chance that they'd just drop it at court without you turning up.  It's more likely that you would end up with an arrest warrant issued in your name.  Then you'd run the risk of most likely spending a night in a cell, being taken to court in handcuffs, and paying a higher fine.  And you'd live knowing you couldn't summon police assistance for fear that they'd arrest you.

&gt;even though the officer got my address wrong on the fine?

Er, how?  Did you supply a false address?  If so you have probably committed some sort of obstruction offence as well.

My Limericks with Seamus Heaney
Posted on September 3, 2013 by xenagoguevicene	

I went for the coffee and donuts, and traded some rhymes with the man signing books of poetry.  I didn’t know who he was.  He was Irish, I knew he had some poems about the problems Ireland has had over the years.   I had some free time and heard about the literary reception; I’m literate, so I went. 

I had a plate with an onion bagel as I walked up to the poet and said, “There once was a boy from Dundalk, who didn’t know quite how to walk….”

“It’s the Brits fault, think about it,”  he replied with a finger in the air for emphasis as he looked at me directly.  He was smiling.  I like to play with words, and so did he. 

I thought he enjoyed a little unvarnished wordplay among all the fawning fans asking for his scribble in the front of a book.  I started again, “There once was a boy from Peru, who didn’t know quite what to do, he went to his mama, who showed him a Llama….and the rest of the rhyme’s up to you.” 

He laughed.  I can’t remember his reply to that.  It was a sunny April day as we chatted in the school’s library with a couple of dozen other people around we were against a low book case.  Coffee makes my brain race.  Words spill out. 

We talked about Lord Montbatten being killed by an IRA commando team in a targeted assassination in 1979.  He talked about Mountbatten being a colonial master in India enforcing English rule, that he was not just a random fisherman with a title.  Heaney spoke about Montbatten being the last British Viceroy of India, an unelected dictator from a foreign country  I mentioned that Lord Montbatten had been the British official in charge of the allied occupation of Vietnam at the end of WW2, and Montbatten re-armed Japanese Imperial Army troops to put down a Vietnamese Trotskyist working class uprising in 1945 in Saigon. 

“I didn’t know that,” he said to me as if a little piece of an important puzzle had been added  

 He told me that he ran a writing school for poetry during the summer in the West of Ireland, and that I might enjoy coming to the gathering.  I was hoping in my head that I had enough money for gas to travel home in my car that night, not how to pay for a writers retreat across the ocean. 

A faculty member joked with me a few days later, “you spoke more than he did.”  I still didn’t know who the man was.  I knew he was Irish, I knew he had written poems about the unhappy history of Ireland.   I had his translation of Beowulf on my shelf at home.  What a story.   

Later I found out that this witty man had a Nobel Prize in Literature.  Honestly, I am not impressed by that.  President Obama has a Nobel Peace Prize.  The people who vote on the winners are Norwegian elite and politicians from the government; they pick whatever is trendy with that clique.  Still, good people do win for worthwhile efforts.  Henry Kissinger got a Nobel Peace Prize.  Imagine that.

The very next day I got an official notice from my department head that I was not being offered a job the next year and they had to warn me by that date.  My wild days at free literary discussions would have to move on.  I always knew I would end up passing poetry along as a teacher for a ‘hedge school.’

But over the years I really have thought about his answer to my words: “There once was a man from Dundalk who didn’t know quite how to walk….”  Heaney’s answer: “It’s the Brits fault, think about it,” really has made me think about that answer.  Did he mean the man couldn’t walk because he was hurt by the British soldiers?  Did he mean that the long term British exploitation of Ireland lead to the Irelands population to be largely poor and unable to afford adequate health care? 

Did he mean that Irish people blame everything on the British rather than taking responsibility for themselves?   I have thought about that off and on over the dozen years since Heaney said them.

I still don’t have an answer to Seamus Heaney.  But he’s on my shelf, in the library, and alive in my memory. ",null,0,null,1437257003,null,0,false,0,ct82d0w,null,t3_3drz8w,null,t1_ct82d0w,null,t3_3drz8w,null,null,null,1437977070,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's really not, if leaving the euro was a magic pill to solve eurozone countries economic problems they would have all done it by now. 


Regardless, in Septembers referendum the idea was not to join the euro, though that was mainly due to the horrific PR the euro currently has. The UK is very unlikely to leave the EU and so another independence referendum will be a while off, by then I think the proposal will be to join the euro.


And I don't know how familiar you are with Scottish politics, I could go into a lot of detail but there is absolutely every chance that a future referendum would result in independence, and I'm not being overly optimistic, I never thought that September's referendum would pass with a Yes. Also it is very likely that if the UK did vote to leave the EU and there was a snap independence referendum that Scotland would vote easily for independence, this is because one of the main arguments of the No camp was that independence risked Scotland's EU membership.",null,0,null,1437257728,null,0,false,0,ct82pwj,null,t3_3do85c,null,t1_ct82pwj,null,t1_ct82jau,null,null,null,1437977439,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If you rank the terabytes of data that flow through the UK in order of difficulty or cost to intercept, you'll find that the criminals they want to pursue occupy the most difficult top 1-5% of all transmitted data. To successfully intercept that data would require;

* The interception of the first (easiest) 95% of all communication

* A financial outlay orders of magnitude greater than intercepting the first 95%.

To intercept the actual communication they *really* want would involve a phenomenal (and ultimately never guaranteed) financial investment that would simultaneously open the entire UK economy to security vulnerabilities that would essentially cripple it. They'd either have to criminalize certain cryptographic techniques or require additional government keys (which is incompatible and unworkable with most encryption systems).

The UK is uniquely positioned within the topography of the Internet such that it connects most of the developed world outside the USA to the USA (the EU etc. connects to the USA via the UK's transatlantic cabling). By pushing so hard on compromising data security, the UK will lose its status as default interlink point with the USA as customers demand connections through France or Spain, and thus Five-Eyes infosec types will lose their intercepting capability.",null,0,null,1437257974,null,0,false,0,ct82u76,null,t3_3dq1km,null,t1_ct82u76,null,t1_ct7w8vr,null,null,null,1437977556,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

&gt; The 2015 general election will be memorable for many reasons, a key one being the remarkable victory of the SNP gaining 56 of 59 seats in Scotland (increasing their share dramatically from just 6 seats in 2010). Naturally, such a landslide attracts the focus of journalists, commentators and politicians who aim to assess the outcome of the election. Since the exit polls closed a lot of people have tried to make sense of what happened in Scotland. Unfortunately a lot of them made statements that have to be rejected as simply inaccurate.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a mistake, committed by many, to equate a substantial SNP vote with an alleged rise in nationalism or nationalist sentiment in Scotland. It may seem a plausible assumption to engage with (if you do not understand the attitudes of the Scottish electorate), but it cannot be supported by any empirical evidence. To the contrary: the best evidence we have to give us a long term perspective, data from the high-quality, face-to-face Scottish Social Attitudes Survey (SSA) suggests that, if anything, fewer people than before emphasise their Scottish national identity distinctively.

Since 12-13 I've seen 90% of the matches, including 2 at the Lane. I own two jerseys (kits) and a hat.

Sure, I may have started following the team for trivial reasons, but in no way am I a ""plastic fan"".

Froome's win definitely felt...well, it felt something. Those instances where a guy just blows the field away are rare and have sometimes been the products of doping (Floyd Landis comes to mind). I'm not saying he doped but more that people aren't pulling this from their ass, /r/peloton immediately freaked out about it and people argued it to the point mods had to put a cap on it as it was ruining every thread. 

Blaming it on the French is silly, people from all over the world come to watch the Tour (just look at the flags on the side of the road) and there's no evidence this was a French guy. It could have been a Colombian bitter Quintana is beat, or an American, or an Italian, or a Uruguayan (maybe my most random flag so far). 

This is also annoyingly common. Not so common as to make the organisers consider putting in barriers or anything like that, but the pee bomb hits 1-2 riders a year. It's just an unfortunate thing, literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of people watch the Tour every year. Somebody's bound to be a dick.

Sky have bought a lot of new cycling fans into the sport and because they're British they get a lot of slack from British fans. Italians look the other way at Pantani and Cipollini, everybody handwaves all of Eddy Merckx's positive drug tests with ""It was the 70s!"" and you still find plenty of Americans who think it was all a big fat conspiracy by the haterz against Lance Armstrong and everybody does it (they probably have a point on that front). I don't know if that's a big deal really, I guess some might feel Sky are holier than thou but lots of teams try to pull that act, Sky are just good enough that it becomes an issue.

That's probably because of the specific type of post codes that have been rolled out, rather than post codes in general. Rather than something sensible like giving every road or block or something a code, and allowing the house number/name and sometimes street name to do the rest (like UK post codes work), they've given every single house or apartment a unique post code. Not only that, but they're randomised, so two houses next to each other will have very different codes.

This means that, yes, you can write a post code on a letter as the only thing on it and it will get to the right place but 1) if you give out your post code, you're giving out your exact address, which is a bit dodgy for privacy/security (whereas UK post codes can be used for some things relatively anonymously), 2) the post code doesn't help post men or emergency services with locating a place faster, since it's not like saying ""BT12 3AB? Well, I know where BT12 is and the 3s start somewhere around here, so if I aim for there, I should be able to find it"" or something like that - they're randomised so it's zero help in that regard, and 3) it pretty much requires you to be able to google it to find out where something is, so if you're out in the middle of nowhere and are given a post code instead of a full address (which is kind of what the intention was with giving each house a unique number - being able to have all the information you need in one string of numbers), then you're fucked if you don't have internet signal, and no one is going to remember every code for their area, so you can't even ask for directions.

You can make a strong argument that the BBC manages to do a huge amount with the money they get, but that's not the point either.

The point is that the BBC has an almost unique business model where they get to decide what they think is important, and then bill their customers whether they want the product or not.

Under that model it's completely inevitable that the scope of what they do will expand and expand, and that's what we've got. Nine TV channels, 16 radio stations, a huge website.

The court will issue a notice giving you a period of time to leave, usually a couple of weeks, but even when that expires you still don't have to leave.

It doesn't add up because you said you were neutral yet described SNP support as *hysteria*. The SNP are a majority government in a proportional parliament in Scotland, that is infinitely more of a mandate than any recent UK Government yet I would never call Labour or Conservative support ""hysteria"".



&gt;but looking at all the information it seemed very obvious independence was economic suicide at worst and risky at best. Given that 45% of the vote was for independence, their must be a large degree of nationalism and/or hysteria at play. Nationalism can be a very powerful thing when harnessed correctly and the SNP have done so.


That is entirely your own opinion and by no means fact. The referendum debate was incredibly lengthy and complex with valid arguments on both sides, chalking it up to those crazy SNP nationalists is a ridiculously lazy interpretation that holds no water in Scotland.

See above. The law of rent that is that rents will rise to whatever the market can bear goes both ways. In that it cannot exceed the money individuals have. If you've been on here there was an article about people paying up to 72% of their take home pay on rent. This means that while demand exists it is not realisable demand and therefore is irrelevant. 


&gt;The same thing with house prices; where the number of prospective buyers is far higher than the number of available properties, so the price goes up and up.

Maybe but again prospective buyers have to be actually capable of buying to create real demand. The loosening of the credit market from 2001-2008 meant anybody who could fog up a mirror could borrow money. They can't now so that increased demand doesn't exist.

Last season it was clear that some of our players were over-worked, especially towards the end of the season. I don't think Cesc can play every game like last season. Last season, when players weren't performing well, Jose didn't have the option to change them, which is why we constantly saw Oscar playing in the middle despite his poor form. I'm sure that's what he's looking at now with Pedro and Witsel. Remember, Oscar doesn't play out on the wing, so we only have 3 total players for 2 positions currently. If Hazard were to get injured, we'd be spread very thin. 

Ramires is the new Geremi. Jose will use him as a utility player more than a rotational player. Loftus-Cheek will be used like Zouma was last season, i.e. sparingly, but I'm sure he'll get a few starts in the EPL, including all domestic cup matches. That only leaves Cesc and Witsel for the RDM spot.

And you think landlords would just abandon their properties? Not sell them into a market that is scrambling for houses?

&gt;The law of rent that is that rents will rise to whatever the market can bear goes both ways. In that it cannot exceed the money individuals have. If you've been on here there was an article about people paying up to 72% of their take home pay on rent. This means that while demand exists it is not realisable demand and therefore is irrelevant. 

People need somewhere to live. It's not like it's the Sky box where they can cancel it if they charge too much. Currently, the only thing stopping landlords from pushing prices up to stupid levels (London not withstanding) is the availability of other rental accommodation at reasonable rates. Without these, there's nothing stopping the remaining landlords from upping the rent to stupid levels, and people *will* pay as the alternative is homelessness.

&gt;They can't now so that increased demand doesn't exist.

Currently, according to my local estate agent, there are 30 prospective buyers on their books for every house on the market. This is in semi-rural Cambridgeshire. Prices are growing at 10% per year.

I assure you the increasing demand is very much there.

&gt;You also forget something important. If people can't buy they rent... so people who can't buy are already renting.

That's literally my point. The demand for renting stays the same, but the availability of rental properties drops.

I have just said there were very valid points on both sides, I didn't think independence would be a huge economic boost and equally I did not think independence would turn us into a third world country. Most credible economists were saying independence would either be a slight economic benefit or a slight economic disadvantage, and to be fair to both sides of the campaign *officially* neither promised either an economic miracle or complete collapse.


You on the other hand have decided that your opinion is a ""cast iron economic point"", despite the fact you were entirely wrong about the role of the Bank of England in all of this which should have perhaps made you realise you may not be the person who get's to decide in an arbitrary black and white manor which very complex economic arguments are 100% right or wrong.


Next time we may as well forgo all the fuss of a referendum and ask you what we should do, since your opinion is always cast iron fact, even on issues that you admit you have ""no vested interest in"" and clearly haven't been paying too much attention to.

That's not really what's been happening to NASA's budget at all -- hell, it's actually bigger this year than it has been since 2010 ($18,010,000,000); there are arguments about where that funding should go, but that's not the same as cutting it.

This is *really* overstating it.

To explain in more detail:

You have an amount you can put into an ISA per tax year. If you open an ISA and put money in to it. You're using your yearly allowance. 

After the end of the tax year (5th April), if you then put MORE money in it, that immediately makes it your ISA for the new tax year too! That is perfectly allowed.

Let's pretend you have one ISA with Natwest for the 2014-2015 tax year. In the 2015-2016 tax year you open an ISA with Halifax, this is absolutely fine. One ISA per year.

If you move your Natwest one into Halifax, you can still carry on adding your allowance for the new year as long as there is some remaining.

One word of advice though - When you transfer an ISA you MUST fill in a form with your bank and make them do it internally. If you close the ISA and physically withdraw the money into your current account before putting the money into the new ISA, it counts as fresh money again and will come of the limit for the year we're now in.

When I used to work at a bank, some customers would set up a monthly amount into their ISA and, when the new year started they would forget... Suddenly the old ISA is their new year's ISA because money has been put into it! Then if they see another ISA with a better rate, they can't have it.

So yeah - Some people keep their ISAs separate but if you find a good rate it's worth while consolidating them all into one pot.

If non-voting was an endorsement of the status quo, then the 43% of A/B voters who voted Tory wouldn't have gone to the polls - they'd have just stayed at home to give tacit approval. Those in the D/E category are much more likely to vote Labour if they go to the polls, but a disproportionate number don't vote.

So I find it difficult to imagine that *all* non-voters are quiet Tories. People who don't vote have various reasons - political disengagement, not caring, being politically uninformed, not thinking it makes a difference, living in a safe seat, being busy with work or family, or pure laziness.

Full disclosure: I am acquainted with one of the pilots in question. 

Whilst deployed, they are not under MOD command; for the duration of their rotation abroad, they cease to operate under British military procedures. They abide by, in this case, USAF rules, follow orders given to them by USAF staff, and are generally viewed by both militaries as members of the US armed forces. 

Our pilots are involved because they are effectively US military personell for the duration of the rotation, and should be seen as such. 

Any MP that is not aware of this, and furthermore, chooses to try and take the government to task over it, is (IMO) underinformed and overzealous in their attempts to score points against the government.

City declined the most last season and that could continue unless they spend a lot of cash (which will probably happen). Amazed Pellegrini's kept his job for another year.

In 2010 it was 0.51% of US Spending. This year it's 0.47%.

It's been declining since they put man on the moon. It nearly reached 5% in the 60s and in the 90s it was hovering around 0.9 and 0.8% and then int he 200s it practically 1/2 by a percent of the US spending. The only reason the budget has remained rather stable despite cuts to percentage is because the US economy boomed, but since it's been slowing down and China has been taking over they are feeling the squeeze.

http://i.imgur.com/u9Ll3Al.png

And the government certainly is losing interest. It was massive in the 20th century, because they had the Soviet Union to compete with, but now? Nobody. The US government runs on two things: is it profitable? Will it get us one up on our allies and enemies? if yes then go forward if not then cut it back, like most countries.

&gt; This is really overstating it.

Not really. Funding can be increased overtime as time moves on. The UK is already the second largest producer of citable scientific material production and has more universities in the top 100 than any other country except the US. And the top 10 charts are dominated by the UK and USA completely. There is no reason why it cant become a focus for space exploration as well just as it continues and has in the past been the focus for many things. Especially with the UK Space industry expecting to be worth £60bn by 2030 with a goal of the UK capturing more than 10% of the entire market. Also, UK Space industry has a budget of £300m, yet it makes over £11bn. It's vastly punching about it's weight and expanding rapidly. In comparison to the rest of the world the UK space program has one of the smallest budgets, yet it's one of the most profitable and biggest. So, imagine what it will look like by 2025.

The actual capability of a space program is based on absolute funding. The proportion of the government  can decrease while actual funding increases (which is what happened here). I'm not suggesting that the US is as into dickwaving contests as they were during the height of the Cold War, but they're dwarfing everyone else and show no sign of stopping.

&gt;the US economy boomed, but since it's been slowing down

The US recovered from the recession much more quickly and in better shape than most of the rest of the Western world (they're also facing less of a demographics crisis in the coming decades).

&gt;There is no reason why it cant become a focus for space exploration

I agree with this! I just think that saying it could become *the* focus is too far, haha. I'd like to see funding for the UKSA increased and for the UK as a whole to start paying engineers/scientists a whole lot more -- as it is, if you're interested in private spaceflight, it can be seriously worth your time to go to the US and be paid twice as much for the same work (with less taxes and a lower cost of living) even if it means wrestling past ITAR and trying to get citizenship. It'll be hard to get a private space industry off the ground with that looming over the heads of all your future employees.

&gt;Also, UK Space industry has a budget of £300m, yet it makes over £11bn

Evidence for that claim please? You asserted something you think to be true. Got a source for it? Anecdotes don't count of course, because I can say I've seen exactly the reverse.
_______
&gt; Care to back that up at all?

Likely you know it, but you start with the official reports/stats regarding the ""at fault"" parties in motorist vs cyclist collisions and deaths. Motorists are deemed at fault the majority of the time. However, even when you give people those numbers very often they'll go for ""well I see cyclists doing X all the time"". It's generally confirmation bias or they don't notice motorists doing the same thing.

Then you factor in the danger resulting from either group doing something. Today for example I lost count of the number of cars I saw go through red lights, or amber-gamble at the very least. I didn't see any bikes doing it but if I had I wouldn't have been so bothered: when a bike does that the cyclist generally puts themself at risk (ignoring pedestrian crossings of course). When a motorist does it they put many people at risk: a car is ton(s) of metal and glass, while a bicycle ain't.

&gt; a cyclist putting themselves where they can't be easily seen... you need to look after your own backside

Yeah, go you. Way to victim blame. Read the reports of those accidents too or is it that you have a ""common sense"" assumption going on, do you think?

null,false,joekingcomedy69,null,null,null,"right, i worked for barclays specialist complaints team..

you have to take it there before the ombudsman, your complaint should be escalated and dealt with appropriately by the special complaints department.

first thing they do is determine whether it is a bank error..

if its a bank error then they will return every penny with compensatory interest.

if they dont and have a strong rational for doing so, go the ombudsman

i very much doubt barclays wont help you on this one :) you can make a complaint a number of ways but ask the person who logs it i.e. in branch to escalate it asap

barclays cover distress and inconveneince payments also for various thing for example 

£25 for branch visit regarding your issue
£50 for length of time taken to respond
£50 per day you are taking to resolve rather than being in work etc
£10 per hour on phone
full refund, with compensatory interest

for general distress and inconvenience you will be looking at a massive payout

and if youre not happy with any aspect of their resolution, go the FOS

With Ade.. He'd probably be the most talented striker we've seen at Villa for many years, but there's no getting away from the fact that he's a mercenary, plain and simple.

Austin, you feel like you're getting good ol' graft, a guy who's worked his way up and his happy to be there. But there's a massive price tag for a guy who's had what? one season in the top flight? We're all aware of 'second season syndrome' and there's a big risk we'll be paying £15m to see him have just that. Then again, you can't put a price on goals and he nearly scored 20 with a side that were comfortably relegated.

I'd be disappointed if the Villa scouting network only came up with these two options. We'd have known for a long time that Benteke would likely be off regardless of whether we stayed up.

I've been a complaint handler, for another major bank for a few years now. it'll probably take a few days for them to respond to you properly as they'll probably be either investigating or escalating this within their own management structure. they could be potentially coming to a reasonable amount of redress for your situation.

This kind of money may come as a shock, but it's not neccesarily that big of a deal and probably easily fixed, so don't worry too much. if you google the address for the chief exec of barclays and write to their office or fax it in etc and address it to the exec by their full name it will potentially get handled by a higher level of complaint handler by the bank. 

alternatively you can go to your local mp who will also put a lot of weight behind your complaint. However it's great that the press have already began turning this into a shitstorm. Barclays press office will be getting involved to try and stem the negative press for the bank.

I'd expect atleast £250-£500 redress but if you don't feel it's right you can always take it further to the ombudsman. By the way the threat of getting FOS involved has no weight whatsoever, the banks tend to have hundreds if not thousands of complaints going to FOS weekly.

We're looking at footage of the *Queen* doing this... but back in 1933, nobody would ever have thought Elizabeth would be Queen.  George V was still on the throne and would be succeeded by his son Edward, who in turn would marry someone suitable and produce an heir of his own.  Of course, that didn't quite work out.

Assume Edward VIII remained on the throne and died childless (lol - not allowed) in 1972, and that George VI had lived beyond 1952.  That would mean George VI becoming King late in life at that point, making it very likely Elizabeth II would have ascended the throne in the mid-late 1980s rather than when she did.

His brother Albert (who would become George VI) had two young daughters named Elizabeth and Margaret, who were basically the Zara Phillips or Beatrice and Eugenie of their day - well known, but really just hangers on and of little importance.

Id say use a Credit card and then just transfer the money over to pay the card off, its what we're doing and the exchange rate is REALLY good just now :)

The other alternative is to get a preloaded travel card, but I've found they're not that good!

The person you're talking to, and the ones who replied, are not consuming the content, so obviously they don't feel the need to pay.

I, however, do consume the content, but still don't feel obligated to pay.  Here's why:

I've given the government no authority to regulate what I do with EM waves passing across my home.  I don't see where they get the right to charge me for that.  I especially don't see where they get the right to charge me for *other channels* they don't even provide.  I especially *especially* don't see where they get off telling me what I can stream online.

Moreover, even though I cancelled my TV License (I no longer have a TV), they send me threatening, highly deceptive letters, and send guys round dressed in a pseudo-police uniforms to question me, and try to trick me in to letting them in.  I've tried calling them (I object to the fact that I even have to do that), but it doesn't stop the letters.  Somebody has figured out that the cost of the letters is less than the money gained from all the unsuspecting people who fall for their scam.

But the worst thing is what they do to people who actually get caught for not paying.  They steal their money, and invade their lives.  For this alone, even if I were rich, even if I watched nothing but live BBC programming, I would feel obligated not to contribute more resources to this Mafia-like protection racket.

Villa didnt want to give him that but if the alternative is, he just see's out his existing contract and leaves for free... we had no choice. 

Im not angry at Delph, it does seem like he was willing to reject City if Villa held onto Benteke and showed signs of improving. When it came clear we were going to lose Benteke, he jumped from what he thinks is a sinking ship and i cant actually argue against it. The players were going to sign to replace Benteke arnt going to be world class and likely to be punts which could not deliver in the premier league.

If you buy issued government bonds, the money is not spent.  That's because the central bank in this case wants to decrease the money supply in response to inflation.  Eventually, the bonds will be rebought by the government for more than they were sold for, and then someone in the future will spend it.

If you set fire to the money or lose it under your mattress or something like that, then the person who did the work to earn the money is essentially doing charity.

For example, let's you do some construction work for the city and the city pays you $1000.  Then you burn the money.
