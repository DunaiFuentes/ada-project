I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable, but who knows what mental and substance abuse problems this poor devil may be suffering? Alcoholism, Korsakoff's syndrome, epilepsy, PTSD, foetal alcohol syndrome- all these and more. You just don't know, but the fact you saw him in the same place 3 months apart suggests he's got chronic issues.

You seem to have felt him less deserving of your charity because he was still trotting out the same reason for begging as 3 months previous. When alcohol turns your brain to porridge, you run out of neurones to invent new begging 'gimmicks'. Neuropsychologists call this deficit 'perseveration' and it's typical of organic brain problems.

null,false,SMTRodent,null,null,null,"&gt;Are produce and meat very expensive? How much does one typically spend on food to cook at home? I really enjoy cooking, but I need to know if I should prepare for high-price food.

Being in Kent, you can expect to spend anywhere from Â£150 to Â£300 a month on food, depending on your tastes and where you shop. Kent also has astoundingly bland food. You may need to hunt around or even go to London for decent ingredients. 

A battery-farmed chicken is around Â£5, a free range one around Â£10, a cabbage around Â£1, a bag of carrots around Â£1. Beef, as well as any product made with maize or soy, will probably be much, much more expensive than you are used to. Vegetables may be cheaper.

&gt;I've heard, many times, that a motor vehicle is not necessary in the UK, but Kent looks rural on GoogleMaps. Is it still true that I don't need a car?

You don't need a car to live in a city. Depending on where you live in Kent, you will probably need a car. Trains and buses in the South East tend to go in towards a hub, then out again, so it can be a really long journey to go fifteen miles, and a really short one to go fifty miles.

&gt;Libraries in the USA often have internet service and decent audio book/ e-book/ regular book borrowing. I feel almost silly asking, but is it the same way in England? Can you still borrow books and use the internet for free at libraries?

Yes, you can borrow books and use the internet for free at libraries. There are a large number of free wifi spots. However, getting the internet at home will only cost you about Â£30 a month for good broadband unless you're exceptionally unlucky about where you end up living. Internet access in the UK is generally miles ahead of anywhere in the US except very large cities and anywhere Google Fibre has managed to set up, but there are definite holes in the network where you're limited to crap. I don't think crappy access in the UK is as bad as crappy access in the US though.

However in terms of seats Clegg's mates only won 57 to Brown's 200+

Over time, it's becoming clearer and clearer that votes are worth less and less (bar marginals) and for anything to change there has to be an absolutely titanic shift in voter intentions. And for a party to win a majority, they have to go for the broadest, blandest swathe of the electorate. The result? All the jargon, standard talking points and stupid he-said-she-said bullshit.

I watched the first 3-4 episodes and just... didn't like them. I then forced myself to watch the rest, and... I still don't. Unlike everyone else, I'm having trouble enjoying it. Capaldi is an old curmudgeon that seems like he's TRYING to be unlikable, and Clara is a controlling and judgemental witch pretty much the entire way through. Clara wasn't this way before... I really loved her in previous seasons... I don't get why they ruined her character. By the time I got to *Kill the Moon*, I was fully against her.

I watch TV to be entertained. I can honestly say there aren't any characters that I would want to be friends with in real life. That's ok though, if the story is something I would like to experience, but this season has been a failure (to me) as well. The only stories I really enjoyed were *Kill the Moon* (minus Clara) and *In the Forest of the Night*. Otherwise, every episode was like running through sand... technically we got somewhere, but it seemed like the least enjoyable way possible. I actually cheered when Danny died, and the last episode was a sigh of relief that Clara would finally be gone.

Sorry to be so negative.

When I talk about our transfer strategy I'm talking about how we never go after renown players, we go after ones which clubs like City/United etc don't want to take the risk on as they can go for the players the next tier up. It's very clear after reading what Rodgers has said over the last few years that we're more likely not going to go all out on a player we know will be good for us.

City might not be winning a trophy this year, but normally they're in a shout for at least 2 and that most likely wont stop anytime soon.

And no, I don't believe we can be an elite club competing for the title every year if we keep going for potential instead of ability, simply because United, Chelsea, Arsenal and City can all spend more money than us and attract the world class players which we evidently can not. You think our good young players are gonna be happy and stay if we don't compete for things and offer them good contracts?  we should definitely expect interest in Coutinho this summer as well.

&gt; it'll affect the next few years of your life a lot, and beyond that not very much. what do you lose by putting some work in and not being lazy ? 

&gt;however if nothing else, you need to practice decent revision techniques for later life - if you want to go to university you'll do terribly at this lazy approach, you might even struggle with A-levels like that.  i know because it's the exact same way i did it.  A levels were a big step up from GCSE's and you can't take the same approach. A-level exams are much more about solving problems and showing that you know how to solve the problems. To do that, you need not just the knowledge, but practice in *applying the knowledge* to problems.

&gt;Learning how to learn and take that approach now will benefit you for life far more than your GCSE grades ever will. and the only way to learn *that* is by doing it to develop techniques that work.

and just to add to that, look, you don't know what the future holds. Your parents company could go bust, your aunt could sell out and retire. You might not like their company or working in law at all. So give yourself as many options as possible. Putting some work in now and for the next few years costs you very little and is investing in your future and preparing yourself for whatever could happen.

null,false,breezehair,null,null,null,"What the article misses is that immigration on this scale to the UK is a completely new policy, that has happened over the last 20 years. 
It is an order of magnitude more than before. This is a massive change -- it needs a better justification than a projected 2.7% rise in GDP per capita by 2060. (Who believes such forecasts -- was this article an April fool?)

The article contradicts itself: 

&gt;Stagnating productivity has meant that Britain's recovery has simply been driven by people working more hours, rather than boosting the amount each employee produces. That, it turn, has been helped by growing the number of people in the workforce â a substantial chunk of which has been from migrants coming into the country seeking employment (not least from troubled eurozone countries).

Well exactly - more people are employed for longer hours on less money because there are plenty of immigrants to employ. Duh. 

Obviously there are good and bad effects of immigration.  But different cultures don't always mix: there is social segregation and, in the North, towns which are effectively segregated by ethnic group. 

The weaknesses of the article's argument are extraordinary. It is a *policy* that there should be free movement within the EU, not a fundamental right. Policies can be changed. 

The ""economic benefit"" accrues unequally to different groups of people: for most of us, there is little economic benefit at all, because positional goods (like houses) get more expensive. (Higher rents mean higher GDP.)

To argue that the UK's housing crisis is solely because of lack of supply is particularly stupid.  In case anyone hasn't noticed, there is a crazy building boom at the moment! The problem is that the UK's population has increased by 5 million people since 2000, almost entirely because of immigration. That's a lot of houses needed. Over the same period, Germany's population has declined by nearly 2 million. Britain has a housing crisis, Germany does not: we have the same interest rates, but different population growth rates. 

One would have thought that most UK redditors (being in the 18-30 range) might realise the extraordinary effect that immigration is having on their lives by underpinning the high UK rents and property prices.  But apparently few do.

GCSEs are extremely important as it's sixth forms who're going to be looking at your GCSEs. Unless you have a guaranteed entry into some sixth forms in your area, you need to achieve good grades in GCSEs.

Then, for law, you will need to achieve good grades as it's extremely competitive. Some universities look at your GCSEs because it's one of few ways they can differentiate the applicants.

Consider the scenario: 

You decide not to work hard and get generally bad grades. You decide that it's not worth studying A-Levels and you also decide that university isn't for you. So, you do nothing for 5 years of your life.

Just as you join the company, your parents tell you that they screwed up. Badly. Your company is now defunct. Or, you join only to find out that it's extremely boring. You don't want to spend your life working in this field.

Sure, you have enough money to last you rest of your life. But what are you going to do for rest of your life? You want to work in law field? There's another 5+ years of your life missing. Engineering? Ditto.

Almost all well-known profession will need you to study for few years before working in that field.

On the face of it, if you have another route to a secure, good job, then no, GCSEs don't matter.

However ...

Whatever you choose to do now in your mid-teens, it's almost certain that in ten years time you will have a very different outlook on life. Everybody experiences an awful lot in that time and therefore you are highly likely to think differently when you're 25 to how you think now.

And there's the issue. Perhaps when you're in your mid-20s you might decide that you really would like to go to university. Not necessarily for business studies or law or anything career-related, but you might have found an academic subject which you've become fascinated by and would like to learn more about -- philosophy for example.

But without decent A level passes you're not getting in to university, and without the solid grounding that the GCSEs give you you're going to really struggle to understand subjects in the depth required to get those A level passes.

So I'd say get those GCSEs. I know you want to spend the next few months playing computer games, chatting up girls, and generally doing anything rather than sitting up in your room revising -- I know this because that was me 30 years ago!

*Sorry to edit but got thinking... It is quite nuanced. To a lot of people it seems like basic economics - swell the low-wage labour market and it seems logical that will keep wages down and make it harder for the average joe to find a job. Ok there's more to it than that, you have to look at the overall effects and I agree, so let's talk about the benefits and all the rest of it but try to understand ordinary people's fears and acknowledge the facts too. Sure Â£5 a week is a small amount by most standards but it means more to those people than to the people calling it ""negligible"" and it's only an estimate really. I'm not a kipper but these are all arguments they might reasonably use, as well as saying we only want to control the quality etc and pretend to be looking out for working class people by eliminating wage compression.

Mummy on the Orient Express was my favorite Capaldi episode, and Flatline was great too, because he showed some delight in life.

I still watch every week during the season, but it's almost a chore. When a Matt episode comes on, or a Tennant (as long as it's not all boo-hoo-Rose), I watch wholeheartedly.

LFC have to grow responsibily. we can't go out and buy the cavani's, thiago silvas, or for that matter the sterlings, unless we buy them young...and quite frankly, i would much rather follow the dortmund model by developing a young team, and after the squad is developed, fill in with a few signings of bigger clout. if we can manage to keep this core together, sustainable growth is possible. 

the problem with fans like you is that all you do is sit here and talk about buying 1 or 2 players of world class ability...well if we were to replace suarez with world class striker, who would you have bought? falcao? sucked. lacazette? wasnt for sale. benzema? why would we pay 40m for a guy who would be taking a step down from  madrid to play for us. we need to build ourselves up in  sensible manner, and FSG/BR are doing that right now. revenues will rise and with the new tv deals, we will be able to poach more stars...and look how great united's transfers worked out...they're fighting us for 4th right now after 160 m in recruitment. it's not always about high profile, costly players..it's about buying the right players. southampton is a model to follow, but their problem is lack of depth right now. also, you need to be wary of that word world class. suarez was not ""world class"" when we bought him and even if you considered him to be, he was not the 3rd best player in the world at the time. i remember a good chunk of people that were not happy with his purchase at the time. 

all in all, we needed to go for potential these first few years to have a base to build off of and grow. now, this summer, we can buy 2-3 players who can all go into the starting XI and that's a fine approach but last year was all about buying strength in depth and potential superstars. im fine with what we're doing. in fact, i love what we're doing. we're gonna be competing next year and i will remember this when we do",null,0,null,1427992344,null,0,false,0,cpz09os,null,t3_3168iy,null,t1_cpz09os,null,t1_cpyygh8,null,null,null,1432156627,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,breezehair,null,null,null,"Well, the LSE article looked looked at a correlation of changes in percentage of immigrants with changes in wages in different regions, and indeed found no correlation.  This is one interesting piece of evidence, but hardly conclusive. There are likely to be problems with both sets of recorded statistics - it's not easy to measure either immigration or hourly wages accurately or comprehensively (note, they are looking at correlations of *small changes* in hard-to-measure quantities).  There will be other confounding factors - why, for example,  would immigrants choose to move to areas where wages were declining?  This would tend to reduce any correlation. Correlational studies comparing measure A and measure B for many different regions, trying to detect any causal relationship between A and B, are typically problematic - the trouble is, there are endless confounding effects because the regions differ in many respects, not just in A and B. 

You might also want to consider whether there is a publication bias in UK academe. Would it be good for a young researcher's career if they published a paper that did show some negative effect of immigration, and which was then taken up and distorted by the press in anti-immigration articles? I suspect this would close to career suicide for an early-career economist hoping for promotion, and that it is left to Migrationwatch to publish research of this type.

Rodgers on Sterling ambition: âIt aligns everything with what we are trying to achieve here. Weâre looking to be successful.â

Rodgers on Sterling Arsenal links: âArsenal is a great club, but this is Liverpool.â

Rodgers on Sterling: âIâm quite relaxed on it, I think itâs part of the modern game now. Representatives have different ways of working.â

âThe player he is today is because of the environment [at Liverpool]. He still has a lot to learn. He has two and a half years left on his deal, heâs going nowhere in the summer.â

Rodgers on United loss: âObviously it was a disappointing result. We have to make sure we perform [against Arsenal].â

No new injury worries. Henderson back in, Lucas able to start.

Rodgers on form: âOver the last three months, apart from the last game, we have performed well. [Arsenal is] a must-win, but itâs also a must-perform.â

Rodgers on Arsenal: âWeâll have a look at our game [vs. Arsenal] earlier on in the season. We played very well in a system that was just coming togetherâ¦We go there really motivated.â

Rodgers on the international break: âWe had to suffer a little bit,â because of the United loss.

Rodgers BACK onto Sterlingâ¦âLiverpool is one of the superpowers of football. The money doesnât come into it. If the club doesnât want to sell, it doesnât sell. Money has never been the objective.â

Rodgers on Sterling: âIt will always be in terms of the football club.â

Rodgers on Sterling: â[For me] itâs all about maintaining and nurturing development.â

Rodgers on Sterling and money: âFor Raheem itâs about the football. Heâs made it clear very recently that heâs happy here with his football.â

Rodgers on Sterlingâs interview: âNo permission from the club. It surprised us all. Some times heâll make mistakes as a youngster.â

Rodgers on Arsenal tactics: âWe go into the game happy to play our game. We respect Arsenal, as we have the past couple of seasons. Our possession wasnât good enough in the last game [against United]. Weâve talked about thatâ¦we need to keep the ball better, we need to be technically better.â

âFor us weâll go thereâ¦to get something from the game.â

Rodgers targeting âat least a pointâ from the trip to the Emirates.

Rodgers: âWeâve recovered and weâll look to take that into the next game.â

Rodgers: âItâs very, very difficult to maintain [momentum],â references winning ugly at Swansea City.

Rodgers: âWhat Iâve got is a very honest group of players, very committed. But theyâre still learning. Weâll look to take the good elements of our game into Saturday.â

Rodgers on big games: âItâs just the next game for us. Weâve had a long two weeks, our focus is [only]on the next game.â

Rodgers on Sterling AGAINâ¦âAny talks with Raheem will be within and thereâs enough people around the club to encourage him to be here. As I said, Iâm quite relaxed.â

Rodgers on Skrtelâs suspension: âWeâve had important players who havenât played before. Weâre a collective. Martin is a very important player for usâ¦disappointed our appeal wasnât accepted.â

When the facts show EU immigrants help the economy, are less likely to take benefits, better educated and have negligible impact to low income earners (and again, actually increases mid/high earners) I stop caring about fears.  Fears of course being a dog-whistle for xenophobia or worse.   The issue with low pay can and should be fixed by raising the min. wage to a living wage (hint, voting for tory never mind Ukip will not help to fix the problem).  I repeat, full time work even at min wage Â£5 is negligible though.

Another good one is coffee beans - their kirkland ranges are fairly good and you can get a kg of beans for under 8 quid, which is ridiculous (I'm sure it's child labour or something..). Clothes are nicely priced too.. oh and those toothbrush heads for electric toothbrushes!

It's a side effect of the tussle between politicians and the media for the past several decades. It used to be the case that the media would tip-toe around politicians, wanting to stay on the side of the government. Then they got more daring, and (obviously rightly) started scrutinising politicians - which is obviously how the likes of Paxman got their careers.

But then things went the other extreme in the 90s and 00s, where the media just started become malicious in its hounding of politicians. If literally every word you say can and will be used against you, how can you possibly speak freely? Its gotten to the point where the tabloid press will even go as far as to take completely innocuous quotes completely out of context to paint the politician as bad.

The end result is that politicians are forced into a position where they feel they can only really say what their PR advisor tells them to say because if they go off script at all, they risk a journalist picking it up and turning the statement into something it's not. A statement such as ""I used to love Manic Miners"" could potentially be twisted into ""Red Ed wants miners to suffer from bipolar!!!""

This is tiny!  Nobody can produce any meaningful forecast of such an amount over a 45 year timescale. 

The effects that are forecast by the NIESR do not, therefore, seem disastrous at all. In any case little better than guesses, because of the timescale.

but you're absolutely right, there are a lot of tactics being used here from both. lfc are very clear they will not budge right now though, i like that. if we lost him on a free, we would get probably a record compensation fee b/c he's still under 23...although 10m would be nothing compared to the 40m we could get this summer. 

heres the catch, if ibe starts putting in blinders toward the end of this year and next, and marko puts in some shifts...well his bargaining power with us gets a lot smaller. the other benefit to that, is we can let him rot on the bench for a few weeks at a time in theory (especially if we sign some attacking players) and make him truly earn a place. 

this is going to turn into the most interesting transfer saga for a while...at least with suarez, we knew exactly how good he was, what he was worth and that he wanted to leave the whole time...he came out and said as much multiple times..but with raheem, he's trying to harp on this ""kid"" status. which from raheem only, is true but it's his camp trying to push this narrative and its bullshit. 

anywaays yeah you're right if he waits 3 months and gets a 120k deal, he gets rewarded for waiting, but there becomes a point in time when losing out on 65k a week is a problem, and we'll see lfc test taht resolve. john henry will probably hold him ransom.

This obviously equates to just 10% of the middle aged voting demographic, but when you consider the 90s/00s kids are now voting age - when video games stopped being ""just a nerd thing"", the cultural perception on video gamers has changed.

EDIT: Since the 10% who were gamers in the 80s is different from the 10% who are gamers now.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) that ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  It dates back to at least 1888, when it was referenced in the novel *The Reverberator: A Novel* by Henry James:

&gt;&gt;*On the front page of the same New York World that contained poor May McClellanâs charming Italian diary, there ran a story with the hysterical headline âARE THE RICH GROWING POORER?â â ... In the end, the answer to the headline, as it is to almost every question in a headline, turned out to be âno.â*  

&gt;The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept, referring to the titles of research papers, has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

And yes, of course he has been mediocre since January.. put any player out of position and they'll most likely be mediocre just look at Ozil at the start of this season/end of last.

null,false,JerkDaniels,lfc12,,null,"I was intrigued by the recent TAW discussion with Sean Rogers (I believe) who's a regular but he's got his UEFA badges and manages a team.

He brought up a point that Pep Guardiola would look at the way his side and the opposing side would likely line up and identify the players most likely to be 'redundant'. Since I don't want to quote it wrong I'll just use this example to sum it up. 

Giroud will likely play alone up top with Cazorla, Welbeck, and Sanchez supporting him. If we play 3 at the back, that's 3 CB's concerned with Giroud as the lone striker. If they play more direct to Giroud the way Fellaini played against us, then that also brings in our DM (Allen/Lucas). So that's about 4 players defending one striker. 

If we play 3 at the back against a single striker we're carrying a center back or two as passengers in the game. This is problematic when you could otherwise add an extra body or two into midfield. This, IMHO, is why we looked a man or two short always against United, AND we looked more controlling against united when we went down a man because it essentially forced our hand to push a defender into midfield as an extra body to press when we didn't have the ball and distribute when we did have it.

I also think that Arsenal are clever enough to play between the lines and drag our back 3 out of position, IMHO.

null,false,mishagale,null,null,null,"&gt;I've seen that a few places don't ask for a deposit before renting - is this typical or something I should be wary of?

My guess is those places are sublets, I'd steer clear. Normally, the only places you don't need a deposit for a some forms of social housing, which I doubt you'd qualify for. However, landlords here are required to keep your deposit with a 3rd-party ""deposit protection service"", who will mediate any disputes, so it's much easier to get your deposit back, so long as you don't trash the place.

&gt;Cell/mobile phones: can I get a cheap data plan on a phone there? I know my phone company doesn't offer service abroad, but I'm hoping I can still get an internet-enabled phone for decent price. Is there a particular company that would be good for that?

Easiest thing is probably to get a SIM-only pre-pay deal. Make sure your phone is unlocked (not tied to a particular carrier) and supports GSM (1800Mhz, although a few carriers also support 900, and for 3G internet it's 2100), and you'll be fine. If your phone is locked, you can get it unlocked at a shop or market stall for about Â£10-Â£20. [GiffGaff](https://giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/mishagale) is pretty good if you don't want any kind of contract. (Yes, that's my affiliate link.)

&gt;I've heard, many times, that a motor vehicle is not necessary in the UK, but Kent looks rural on GoogleMaps. Is it still true that I don't need a car?

Depends a bit on where in Kent you are going to be living - if you are in a city, there'll be bus services everywhere (and none of Kent's cities are so big you can't walk across them in an hour or two), and you can get a train to other towns and cities. That said, while you will need a car less than you would in America, it'd probably still be useful to have one.

&gt;Libraries in the USA often have internet service and decent audio book/ e-book/ regular book borrowing. I feel almost silly asking, but is it the same way in England? Can you still borrow books and use the internet for free at libraries?

Yes, they do have free internet. Online borrowing of ebooks/audiobooks is less commonplace and the selection can be a bit rubbish, but it seems [Kent libraries](http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/libraries) do offer it, [here's the catalogue](http://kent.lib.overdrive.com/A9333D7A-8A55-4F21-BB90-3E930FB85B59/10/50/en/Default.htm). Obviously, there'll be fewer books by Americans and more by Brits. You'll need proof-of-address to get a library card, which should give you access to all the public libraries in the county.

&gt;I'm well aware that my American style of dress is generally considered lazy and sloppy by Europeans, but how much will this hold me back from being able to make acquaintances/ friends? As a woman, am I going to be expected to wear a skirt or dress regularly? Are blue jeans really not ok for everyday wear (or for hitting up a bar/pub/getting drinks)?

You are probably thinking of France or Italy. No one in Britain is going to be bothered by you wearing jeans and a hoodie unless it's some kind of formal occasion. Some offices do have a smarter dress-code though, depends a lot on what kind of industry you're working in.

null,false,devssieger,lfcflame,,null,"Maybe I can help. For tactics, I use three different styles. Two 1-striker systems and 1 two-striker system.

Tactic one is the tactic I use against weak defenses: The game calls it a 4-1-1-4 DM Wide Asymmetric M (C). It has a sweeper keeper set to attack, two full backs playing as attacking complete wing backs, two center backs playing as defending ball playing defenders, a DM directly in front of the LCB playing as a defensive halfback, a CM in front of the RCB playing as a supporting deep lying playmaker, a left attacking mid playing as a supporting inside forward, a right attacking mid playing as an attacking advanced playmaker, a left striker playing as an attacking trequartista, and a right striker playing as an attacking poacher (Balo can play either position with good results). The team is set with an attacking mentality and a very fluid team shape. For team instructions, I like to (1) retain possession, (2) use shorter passing, (3) work the ball into the box, (4) play out of defense, (5) utilize whipped crosses, (6) look for overlap, (7) play narrower, (8) use a much higher defensive line, (9) close down much more, (10) use a much higher tempo, and (11) be more expressive.

The second tactic is one that I use for most road games and most games against teams of similar strength.The GK and back four are the same, the DM is in the same position as the first tactic (but is a defensive defensive midfielder this time). The CM is in the same position and unchanged, both the AML and AMR are attacking advanced playmakers. This tactic has 1 ACM (set to advanced playmaking and attack) and 1 striker (set to attacking poacher). This tactic uses a control mentality with a very fluid shape. The only difference between shouts in this tactic and the first is that this one does not use the much higher defensive line.

The third tactic is for road games against big baddies. It's basically a standard 1-4-3-2-1 in which the defenders and keeper are set up the same as the first two tactics. As opposed to the first two, the DM in this formation is centered and is a defending half back. The LCM is a supporting deep-lying playmaker and the RCM is a supporting box-to-box midfielder. Both the AMR and AML are attacking advanced playmakers, and the striker is an attacking poacher. This formation also uses the control mentality and has a very fluid team shape. This has the same team shouts as the first tactic, except it doesn't use shorter passing or the much higher defensive line.

tl;dr: I offered my three tactics. I hope this helps. These three formations helped Balotelli to 42 goals (13 penalties) and 11 assists in 48 appearances. Sturridge got 21 goals and 15 assists in 38 appearances.",null,0,null,1428000635,null,0,false,0,cpz529u,null,t3_3176q8,null,t1_cpz529u,null,t1_cpz46mq,null,null,null,1432158955,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

i will argue that moreno has been great in flashes and is going to be much betterr next year. lallana, with a full pre-season, no world cup and no injuries will start to look like what we paid for and balotelli at 16m still has HUGE upside. if he bangs in 20 goals next year, which we all know he has the potential to do, will be worth 25-30m. no doubt. all of the players we bought last year were bought with a view for the future bar lambo, lovren and lallana and i can't slate lallana because of his stop-start injury record. in addition, lovren was piss poor, but he was also lauded as jesus when we bought him so now that expectations are lower, hopefully he can continue working and grow into the club (still extremely young for a cb...remember martin didn't get a lot of time with us until he was 27-28...)...i would also argue kolo was a great piece of business for us. ilori and alberto the judgement is still out. alberto could theoretically net us a profit because of his age and credentials, aspas admittedly was a bad buy. markovich cannot be slated because of how high his ceiling is and manq was a low risk, high reward loan...i can see why you aren't super happy with our transfers, but looking at someone like allen who was recently being lauded for his performances bar manu, that's the blueprint. we have lots of kids in the squad...take away kolo, brad jones, stevie g, glenjo and skrtel and the average age of the squad is like 22? HIGH ceiling. high risk, high reward, that's where we're going and quite frankly, its probably the only route we have to making it back to the elite echelon's of world football. now that we have so much promising youth, this summer we need t absolutely lock up milner (great stevie stop gap, versatile and perfect for our system), a starting rb, another cm and another attacking option. most people don't believe it, but i would be hard pressed to see fsg not spend another boat load of money on players. somewhere to the tune of 100m wouldn't be out of the question. call me crazy, but if they are true to their word about putting revenues all back into the team, that's the amount of money we're dealing with. plus, oversees (although the two are completely unrelated) the red sox are spending big again and in a similar stage of their rebuilding phase...don't be surprised to see fsg pump big dollars into the squad and make a big push for top 4/trophies next year. we have a platform and an unbelievable chance to do something big by establishing ourselves again as a force. mind you, we were 4 very winnable games away (this season) from being 2nd place, so our progress is very clear minus the mental lapses from the first half of the season.

anyways im extremely optimistic and i believe in this project. i see clear cut progress and we showed in our 13 game unbeaten run that without suarez, we are very difficult to beat now that we've found our feet. BR is a genius and the system next year will see us move back to a 4-3-3 or a variation of it and i fully expect us to challenge HEAVILY on 4 fronts.

Back in the day fans recorded the audio as they watched the episodes, and this amateur film company Loose Cannon set all the audios to any still frames/footage that still existed. There are also some fan made ones that are excellent quality. I've seen all the lost episodes. 
You can access these through Primewire.ag. it links to sites that stream the episodes. I believe Dailymotion is where I've seen most classic episodes.
All the classics are available if you're dedicated!

Also fun fact: the reason there are lost episodes is that back in the day the actors union didn't show reruns, believing that it would make less work for actors. With the price of film in those days, it made sense to wipe the film of the old episodes that they believed they would never need again, so they could reuse the film. But then a bbc fan liaison, blanking in his name... Levine maybe?... He stepped in and basically told the BBC to stop, because he loved doctor who, as did many fans. So they stopped wiping the episodes. 

Luckily, Doctor Who fans have always been fantastically dedicated, and as I said above, they recorded the audio of all the episodes.

I am quite glad of this. Labour are not wasting there time on people who have already made their minds up. They are instead focusing on showing everyone who Ed is, which they need to do because just a few months back he was a blank slate personality wise. He has really come into his own recently, they have clearly hired / fired someone, something has definitely changed.

As for convincing people to change their votes, I think it is a waste of time in any case and I think Labour know this.

No club would be stupid enough to only buy players within a Â£5million price range, because there's young talent to be developed that costs a lot less than Â£10m, and potentially glorious talent that could be available for a bit over Â£15m.

As for Lamella, he hasn't lived up to his price tag yet. However his flashes of brilliance show why people thought he was worth Â£26m, and if he can consistently produce his best he will be worth more than that.

&gt;4.36 We estimate that an increase of 100 foreign-born working- age migrants in the UK was associated with a reduction of 23 natives in employment for the period 1995 to 2010.

&gt;Page 64 @ https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257235/analysis-of-the-impacts.pdf

&gt;4.9 Table 4.3 presents estimates for the impact of migrants on the wage distribution in the UK. The majority of these studies find that migrants increased wages at the top of the wage distribution but reduced wages at the bottom.

&gt;4.10 Dustmannet al. (2008) used UK data from 1997 to 2005 to estimate the impact of working-age migrants on the UK wage distribution. The results from this paper suggest that an increase of10,000 working-age migrants in the UK decreased average wages,by approximately Â£1 per year for the bottom 10 per cent of earners, but increased average wages for the median earner and the top 10 per cent of earners by approximately Â£4 per year and Â£5 per year respectively.

&gt;4.11 Nickell and Saleheen (2008) used data for Great Britain from 1992 to 2006 to estimate the impact of migrants on average wages by occupation group and by occupation. Their results suggest that an increase of 10,000 migrants working in semi-skilled or unskilled occupations reduced average wages in that occupation by around Â£8 per year, and that an equivalent increase in the number of migrants working in skilled production occupations reduced average wages by around Â£15 per year. Migrants were found to have had little or no impact for other occupation groups. Considering the impact by occupation, an increase of 10,000 migrants working in caring personal services is estimated to have reduced average wages in this occupation by approximately Â£25 per year.

null,false,TVKMarkII,null,null,null,"Wow...ok kid, no offence, but you've got a lot of learning to do. If not for your GCSEs, then life in general.

&gt; I got 100% in the Mensa tests at 10 years old, and got a place in a 'prestigious' selective grammar school for my secondary education.

No, you didn't. For one, if you were that smart, you'd know that A) MENSA examinations are only a measure of some basic logical reasoning skills and not a measure of all-round intelligence types (of which there are multiple), and that you cannot score ""100%"". B) You'd know that any formal examinations are important. C) You'd be predicted all A-stars at GCSE, most likely would've already taken them and got those A-stars, and be doing A levels with similar ease. 

&gt; From then on I have kind of just lost interest in academic work and tend more to ponder on Literature and philosophy, girls, oh and Xbox.

That makes you sound phenomenally pretentious. You could stop the sentence after ""academic work"" and we get the idea.

The whole paragraph about your parents offering you a future can be summed up thusly: ""My parents own a successful business, they've offered me a senior position which once I turn 21 which would be more than adequate, however I feel my heart is not in it and I'm interested in law"". No need to flash about the money or cars or any of that. 

&gt; I could get all A* at A level if I took English, English and History.

Haha...yeah, no, you just can't say that. Maybe you could, maybe you couldn't. A levels are harder than most people think. A lot of smart people get far below what they think they should.

&gt; I would not be earning anywhere near the same amount of money for years.

That's completely unnecessary, seeing as your post is about being happy, rather than making money.

Anyway...here's my actual response to your questions:

The top universities look at GCSEs and, at Oxbridge at least, they will want minimum all A-stars and As. Maybe they'll allow a B in an unrelated subject (for Law...maybe something like Chemistry). But you won't get much of a look-in with anything worse. Often GCSEs are used to distinguish between multiple similar candidates, so yes, they're important.

You also need them to continue to A level, I know for my 6th form I needed a minimum of 6As and 3Bs (it was a grammar school same as you). 

After that, employers probably won't look at them aside from english Language &amp; maths, as long as you've passed those two. 

But as Newsbot3 said, it's important to develop a proper studying routine now. I didn't at GCSE, because I didn't study at all, and it hit me hard later on. You may as well develop a good habit and put in hard work while it's easier, than have to force yourself to do it when everything is harder and more effort.

As for law V your family business. I wouldn't make that decision based on the advice of some random internet people, nor would I make it at the age of 15/16. Give it some time, see what you're interested in at 18, make a decision closer to the time. I don't see why going to uni would stop you from continuing going into the business after you graduate anyway? 

Sorry if this post feels like I'm bashing on you personally, I'm not. But you'll go a lot further as a lawyer or CEO if you know how to win people over. One of many techniques is being humble and modest. Neither of which you particularly show signs of at the moment.

It may have also been useful to provide several drm-free ways to get this 10th anniversary content, like [VHX](http://vhx.tv) for example, as not everyone can learn to use torrent software.

Although I think it's worth forgiving these things on their first attempt to explore alternative distribution platforms, I'd hope that BBC can up their standards in the future if they aim to challenge and compete against HD caps and rips. I love that BBC went back to remaster and upscale the first ~4 seasons for the blu-ray box sets, but it pains me to still see digital releases of s1-4 only offered in sd-quality on itunes, amazon, vudu, etc. After putting in all of that hard work and effort, why do they continue to gimp the quality of digital releases; even with torrent-bundles?",null,0,null,1428007081,null,0,1428012024,0,cpz99oe,null,t3_31763f,null,t1_cpz99oe,null,t1_cpyzlzp,null,null,null,1432160937,null,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12,null

I think Capaldi is utterly brilliant in the role, but I'll agree that the single episode storylines waste a lot of potential. Mummy on the Orient Express could have been brilliant as a 2 or 3 part story, giving us more time to learn about the supporting characters, the Mummy, and maybe the people behind gathering everyone together. But no, the whole season was yet another speed dating version of Doctor Who storylines.

There was a reference in Last Christmas that makes me worry that they're going to bring back the Doctor/companion love interest angle.

Tadic was one of the best players out there for Serbia, but they looked really terrible, so that isn't saying much. I'd rate his performance as about on level with how he's been for us lately. Duricic floored Ronaldo and got a yellow, and that was about the highlight of his night. He came in and had some good touches but nothing spectacular, and the game was pretty wrapped up by the time he arrived. 

Fonte looked good but Serbia was really toothless all night. Not his fault for the goal at all. 

Morgan was Morgan. Played much deeper than he usually does for us, but looked solid the whole game. Did nothing going forward but that really wasn't his job. 

Pelle scored finally, but also missed an open net. I think this game will do wonders for his conscience but he's not 100% back to himself yet. Should also mention he was in a two striker set with the smaller Eder who did a lot of pressing for him, leaving him mostly as a big post up presence and target off set pieces. Did it well though, I think he's probably more versatile than we give him credit for.

HIV diagnosis rate of 1.0 per 10,000 population2
(1.4 per 10,000 men and 0.46 per 10,000
women) (Appendices 3, 4 and 5). New diagnoses have been declining since they peaked in
2005 (at 7,890) (Figure 2), largely due to a decrease in the number of diagnoses reported
among heterosexuals born in high HIV prevalence countries.
Data on country of birth was available for 83% of people newly diagnosed with HIV. The
proportion of new HIV diagnoses reported among people born in Africa halved from 54%
(3,460/6,420) in 2004 to 25% (1,240/4,980) in 2013. This has resulted in an increase in the
proportion of new diagnoses reported among people born in the UK (from 32% (2,040/6,420)
to 46% (2,220/4,980)) over the same period.

&gt;The Pew Research Center projections attempt to incorporate patterns in religious switching in 70 countries where surveys provide information on the number of people who say they no longer belong to the religious group in which they were raised. In the projection model, all directions of switching are possible, and they may be partially offsetting. In the United States, for example, surveys find that some people who were raised with no religious affiliation have switched to become Christians, while some who grew up as Christians have switched to become unaffiliated. These types of patterns are projected to continue as future generations come of age. (For more details on how and where switching was modeled, see the Methodology. For alternative growth scenarios involving either switching in additional countries or no switching at all, see Chapter 1.)

We are able to recover some of those costs as we have deals with other countries to do so and all of us are free to use health services in the EU when on holiday.

Speaking of holidays, tourists, people here in the UK, on holiday, that are taken ill are also counted as health tourists.  These aren't people that are coming her to use the NHS and go home again, they are contributing to the economy through tourism and unfortunately find themselves in a situation where they need health care.

It also counts Ex-Pats that come to the UK for NHS treatment, those that by your definition of it being national, have a right to use it.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"My thoughts; no clear winner. The debates probably entrenched the existing positions rather than made any big adjustments like last year. 

On each;

* **Miliband and Cameron**: Locked in a duel to outdo each other without making a big fuckup. In a sense both succeeded, neither screwed up, but neither won the decisive feat of one-upmanship that they had obviously hoped might happen. Miliband still came across as dorky and less the statesman than the slightly more confident and role-filling Cameron, but in truth they are both pretty vapid PR-men. One can only imagine how Miliband's gentle breeze would have sized up against a political tsunami like Boris Johnson for example.

* **Farage and Sturgeon**: They probably appealed heavily to their own crowds with a few tidbits for everyone else. People who don't like Farage aren't going to suddenly like him after this. HOWEVER, people who agree with him (and there are no shortage of them in the real world outside this subreddit) will probably applaud some of his home-truths on immigration. Sturgeon similarly probably appealed a lot to Scottish voters with her left of centre fairytale world. I can imagine a lot of jocks were getting ragi-semi's about the points she made on the Westminster system. It was pretty cleverly delivered I thought (although I didn't think she really made a compelling case for why the SNP are the answer to Westminsters issues... and essentially a smarter person could reduce her argument to ""Vote SNP because our name isn't Labour or Conservative and so we are better"")

* **Clegg**: Probably the real story was this guy... or the lack of him. After his better performance in 2010 I had wondered if he might enjoy something of a slight boost from this, but it didn't happen. He came across as insincere and unoriginal. His tuition fees rebuke was only little better than simply saying ""*because.... your mum!*"" and that was despite the 5 years he's had to think of it. I think his lack of performance will probably entrench his poor poll ratings. Cameron effectively destroyed much of his potential argument when he pointed out he's sat in the same cabinet and agreed to the same things.

* **Barnett and Wood**: Irrelevant, clumsy and oft times parochial. Perhaps they appealed to their own crowds, I don't know (or care).

An example of how religious demographics are vulnerable to micro-events is if such a methodology was used to project religiosity in 1970s Spain. At the time polls showed a stable 99% Catholic demographic in Spain and by the same methodology would have been projected to remain constant well into 2010. What happened instead is that the political climate drastically changed within merely a decade and by 2010 only 60% of Spaniards identify as Catholic. 

And history has shown that the inverse can be true with religiosity suddenly hardening, e.g. Fascism in the 30s and Islamic fundamentalism in the 80s.

So a projection, that merely ties itself with demographics, applies a linear projection corresponding with present patterns of *religion switching* and yet has an irremediably wide margin of error when likely events of consequence are considered, is simply useless.

No they aren't. The SNP and infact the entire Scottish parliament is only really half a government. The problem is they get to spend money but they don't have to raise it... and raising capital is half of what governments do. That is why they can do no wrong. It's much harder to ostracize yourself from voters when you only spend X amount of something instead of Y. What really ticks off voters is taking money from them, rather than spending it on the wrong things (ironically).

The problem for Westminster comes when it has to actually raise the money that Sturgeon gets to spend. They have to make hard choices - like raising VAT, introducing punitive measures on under-occupied social housing (i.e. the bedroom tax), freezing public sector pay etc. in order to keep the country solvent and to retain fiscal credibility. Sturgeon doesn't have to do any of those things. 

Ironically, it strikes me the solution to Scottish separatism might be to give them full reign over their own tax raising powers and do away with Barnett... when Scots are poorer as a result of it they might think twice about the SNP.

&gt;Do you think we'd see widespread comments about how he got elected? About his competancy? Whether he was involved? Calls for him to be arrested? Attacks on the party he represents?

You would get some of that if the politician and his peers specifically, directly, and regularly told the public that they are making a special effort to keep an eye out for anyone about to shoot up a school. And if it wasn't just the politicians son, but seven other members of his family that shot up the school too.

Surely you'd agree that someone would bring it up in that case?

Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP standing for Rochdale just tweeted
&gt;Rochdale stands united against any terrorist activity and we are constantly vigilant about any signs of radicalisation

But the fact that a Labour councillor in Rochdale just discovered that 8 members of his close family were not only a little bit in support of terrorists, but actually trying to cross the fucking boarder, probably indicates that the Labour party in Rochdale ISN'T constantly vigilant about any signs of radicalisation.

So I don't think comments here are so much blaming the father for the sins of the son, rather than they are saying the father is a liar, a bad leader, and probably a danger to have in the position which he is in.

The point of their party is to get the best deal for Scotland which we know is going to take money from England (increasing the money given to Scotland means less for the rest of the UK unless the government can magic money from thin air).

&gt;  You've waffled on like it would be some kind of punishment for them to have full control when it has been very apparent they've been pushing for just that

I think the SNP have miscalculated on it. I believe they think that by taking control of tax and spending powers they can convince voters that Scotland would have a vibrant economy post-independence... and the reality is that is why they lost the referendum, because of the economic arguments. They had the hearts and minds all along, they just couldn't convince people about their numbers and when it boils down to it a lot of voters will take the percieved safest option in terms of their own personal finances.

Putting the SNP in charge of tax and spend has the potential to backfire on them. It would shift the economic argument away from being ""Westminster vs Scotland"" to being ""SNP vs Greens vs Labour vs Conservatives"". It would mean there would be competing visions for the allocation of funding in Scotland. It would also force the incumbence SNP to make those hard choices that they constantly criticize Westminster for. There is simply no way their popularity would have improved for it in my opinion. Because the problem with taxation powers is it creates winners and losers. Winners will vote for you - losers will despise you for generations. You only have to look at the poll tax to see the effects of that sort of mentality. 

So no, I think I do know what I'm talking about.

No, just don't talk about it with the same hyberbol and misinformation the press and Farage spout

You're missing the point.  More people = more need for products = more jobs.  Some of those job will go to recent immigrants.  I know there is perception that because some people will work for less wages are compressed, but that only works if there are less jobs to be had, if jobs are being created that doesn't happen.  Also, it's not as though they are negotiating their wages down.  A job is advertised at a set rate, and they take it.  Wages are lower because companies and employers are slashing wages to squeeze more profits out of of their products.  It isn't the fault of poor people, regardless of where they are from, its companies unfairly paying low wages or at the very least not adjusting wages for inflation.  And a lot of that inflation, especially in housing, comes from very well off immigrants that can already afford very comfortable lives and expensive house.  The people that the Government actively seeks and that Farage wants to promote as the perfect immigrant because they can support themselves, but they end up driving costs up because they have a wealth of money to spend.  Not to say that we don't need them or shouldn't have them, but it's these (as well as ridiculously rich Asian investors willing to spend millions on houses they won't live in only to rent out at exorbitant rates) that are the cause of inflation and lower wages in real terms, not poor working class people in the same situation as their peers.",null,0,null,1428013185,null,0,false,0,cpzczql,null,t3_3180tm,null,t1_cpzczql,null,t1_cpzclew,null,null,null,1432162763,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Partly because they weren't comprehensives, they were comprehensives with the most academically inclined kids removed. In other words they were secondary moderns.

 Not surprisingly, selecting the most academic kids to go to the grammars  tends to skew the culture in the remaining ""comprehensives"" because you're not only filtering out academic kids, you're removing the most active and engaged parents. In addition tendency also is for the best teachers, governors etc to try and vie for grammar positions since life is easier.

Edit:  Maybe people don't know about the Rolling Stone UVA scandal.  A few months ago, Rolling Stone ran an article about how there's a rape crisis on campuses.  In particular, they focussed on a female student at University of Virginia (UVA) who claimed to have been subjected to a brutal gang rape at a frat-house.  

First the story caused a national scandal.  The described rape was incredibly brutal and people were shocked.  The fraternity in question was instantly suspended and the media began a frantic conversation about how UVA could have allowed such a savage rape to have occurred.  Surely this, by itself, was evidence that campus rape-culture was real, and that the nation needed to deal with these fraternities and fast.  

But then, a few contrarian journalists started asking questions about parts which seemed to them like exaggerations.  Of course this too caused outrage.  Articles were written in Jezebel and other publications attacking these would-be sleuths who seemed so eager to prove a rape-victim a liar.

Finally, after several months, which ended in a police investigation, the story collapsed.  It was concluded that the student's testimony to Rolling Stone was full of holes and could not possibly have happened in the way she had described to the magazine.   And Rolling Stone journalist was accused of using a troubled and unreliable source in order to prove a thesis. 

False accusations?  Not so fast says Valenti, who, practically alone in the media,  *still* maintains that the student is likely a victim, even though all the evidence points otherwise.

DC gets interrupted by a ""protester"" - sound man fades her, clanging noise in background as she is ejected. 

-----
What did the politicians actually say?

DC said, look, I've done this job for five years now, and I'd like to do it for five more. I'll save Â£1 out of every Â£100 to pay off the deficit.

EM said that when he is PM he will abolish zero hour contracts, build new cheap houses, increase minimum wage to Â£8 and scrap free schools.

Nick Clegg said he has made mistakes, and learned from them.

Natalie Bennett said that she'd save the animals. 

Leanne Wood said that the People in the Valleys still haven't recovered from the last recession, said Plaid Cymru, a lot, and said thank you in Welsh at the end... Oh, and also, at one memorable point, that Nigel Farage was, wait for it, right.

Nicola Sturgeon corrected Nigel Farage about taxes, I don't know if it was fact checked, but it sounded good. Then, best soundbite of the night, said that admission to further education should be based on tour ability to learn, not to pay, and that as someone who received a free university education, she had no right to take that away from other people. Many people discuss moving to Scotland.

Nigel Farage said that he isn't against immigrants, that he actively said that some people should be admitted. That we need to build a new house every seven minutes to cope with demand and that 60% of people with HIV are immigrants. My favourite Nigel moment was when he tried to tell Red-Ed to get back on point, but took him back to the wrong question. (rather cruelly, I also think he looked like a wide mouth frog, this is not important, but I feel I should share.)

Oh, and the moderator said ""Thank you"" a lot, and was, in my opinion, somewhat ineffectual and stopping them all trying to talk at once, or just keeping on talking when she was trying to change the subject.

The most significant failure of the New Labour government was probably pursuing continued financial deregulation, that was ultimately the cause of the recession, which made significant cuts necessary. 

Before the financial crisis the SNP stood with the Tories in strongly criticizing Labour for not going far enough in financial deregulation. They called for Scotland to embrace the economic model pursued by Ireland and Iceland, which is ironically not dissimilar to Tory ideas about a kind of Britain as Switzerland/Singapore - of deregulation and low corporate taxes.

And a year ago they were making projections assuming oil prices would continue to go up, or stay stable, rather than in fact dropping by almost 50%, which has required tax cuts to even keep the North Sea oil industry going. That would have increased the Scottish deficit to 3-4% higher than the rest of the UK, which is a greater percentage than the Tories have cut in the entire of the last parliament:

http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7637

Which would, in turn, have required major ongoing austerity simply out of a need to satisfy the bond markets and be able to borrow the money to fund ongoing lending.

These are collosal mistakes on some of the most vital economic issues of the last 15 years. It strikes me, the SNP maintain their credibility with the public principally because they weren't in a position to put these policies into force.

It also made London a world financial centre and brought massive amounts of investment into London, the problem with this, it is quite visible, I am saying London, not the UK, there is limited diversification across the UK's cities unlike in places like Germany, the Financial crisis was largely caused by America, and then essentially crushed the world, aiming and succeeding to become a world financial centre is hardly a failure. 

&gt;Before the financial crisis the SNP stood with the Tories in strongly criticizing Labour for not going far enough in financial deregulation. They called for Scotland to embrace the economic model pursued by Ireland and Iceland, which is ironically not dissimilar to Tory ideas about a kind of Britain as Switzerland/Singapore - of deregulation and low corporate taxes.

And that was probably the best path for the UK at the time, times change and once again the financial crisis wasn't caused by the UK, the UK is a (I was going to say pawn but they are bigger than that) Bishop in this game, they would have had to shut down the UK to cause it. 

&gt; And a year ago they were making projections assuming oil prices would continue to go up, rather than in fact dropping by almost 50%, which has required tax cuts to even keep the North Sea oil industry going. 

How are you not a billionaire with all these seemingly obvious financial outcomes, oh right, that is because they aren't obvious at all, oil prices have only changed due to the actions of Russia in the Ukraine, but you can show me your receipt for the bet you put on Russia invading Ukraine, because I am sure you got amazing odds and made tons of money on it as it was so obvious and of course all the money you made on the oil futures market as well.  

&gt; These are collosal mistakes on some of the most vital economic issues of the last 15 years.

This is colossal BS is what it is, I don't even support the SNP, or even live close to Scotland, but don't just make shit up expecting people not to defend actions that everyone else would have done and were perfectly sound process when they were thought up.

The 3-4-3 has been found out. It worked for a good while, but in our last few games it hasn't been very effective. We were lucky to beat Swansea, got bossed by United at Anfield and even Blackburn were able to hold us to a boring goalless draw at home.

I don't know whether switching it to a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2 diamond is the answer, but something needs to be done. In a classic case of armchair management, I shall now point out problems with the 3-4-3 without offering any solutions:

- We cannot fit Lallana, Coutinho, Sterling and Sturridge into our starting 11. We keep playing either Lallana or Sterling as a wing back to crowbar them in, and they're both ineffective and wasted in that position.

- We keep seeing our attacking line isolated. Because our front three need space between defence and midfield to operate, teams are just closing off the gap and cutting off supply, leaving our midfield 3 outnumbered.

As an aside, if we do play 3-4-3 again against Arsenal, it will be Lovren coming into the back three, not Kolo.

null,false,show111,null,null,null,"&gt; Agnostics and atheists are distinct. Atheists reject the assertion, theists accept the assertion, agnostics refuse to do either. 

This is one definition that is widely used. Another popular one, which many argue is more correct (including the person you're replying to) is that atheism and agnosticism are different scales. Atheism -&gt; theism marks belief or lack of it, while agnosticism is a statement about whether knowing is possible or practical and does not preclude being a theist or atheist.

Under this definition, many (plausibly most) atheists are anostic atheists, not believing in any gods but not claiming they can actually prove there aren't any - just that in the absence of any evidence, there's no reason to do so. There are also many agnostic theists, and some consider this important - faith has no value if you have certain knowledge etc.

I think this definition is very much better - under your one, the agnostic neither believes in any gods nor believes in no gods, which doesn't really make sense. It seems that in practice most such agnostics really are atheists, a term that carries no baggage other than that they have no active belief in any god, but agnostic because they do not think knowing for sure is possible.",null,0,null,1428023989,null,0,false,0,cpzitbq,null,t3_317exu,null,t1_cpzitbq,null,t1_cpziim5,null,null,null,1432165577,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Because the process of actually taking over does not take a few days. It takes a few days to get them started with their due diligence, they did that in a few weeks (it seems) and decided against accepting the role of Nomad. You need to make the distinction between starting the process to become a Nomad (which does indeed happen pretty fast) and actually becoming a Nomad for a company, which only happens after thorough investigation.

Here are a few suggestions, they might be a bit outdoorsy though.

Last time I toured Scotland it was in a camper van.  That was pretty amazing. Sea kayaking in Applecross &amp; Little Loch Broom (stayed at Applecross Badralloch camp sites).

If going to Skye, don't take the bridge, take the Glen Elg ferry.  It's not that special, but the drive down Glen Elg is a bit amazing.

If you don't want to campervan, but fancy a bit of rough.  Try wild camping at Sandwood Bay.

An alternative to the single track road to Loch Hourn is to take the ferry from Mallaig to Inverie &amp; have a night there. The pub does great food. You can do circular walk round Knoydart, but it'll take about three days &amp; you probably need a tent.

Watch the mountains, they do kill people. My wife, who has done loads if walking in England was quite surprised. 

Achmelvich has a gorgeous youth hostel right on the beach...

&gt;If he really wants a large payday, he can go to the mls at that age and still get paid a pretty good amount.

I'm no MLS fanboy, but MLS fans (ergo MLS team) don't want (or pay for) second/third tier european players. There's an established formula. Superstars from big clubs and big countries that won something are known by casual fans from the World Cup/Champions League. 

Despite his Barca stint, Ibrahim Afellay doesn't fit that description at all.  Maybe the Qatari League would pay for him.

If someone tries to dispute this, they'll use Keane as am example. He doesn't fit my formula, but he was a superstar for a large fanbase in the US (Irish national team).

But if we're being honest, the only No. 10 I could really see that would fit the way that Jose wants the position to be played who's good enough for Chelsea is Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. He's a very similar player to Oscar, he's probably a better finisher I'd say, maybe not as good of a passer as Oscar is, although Firmino's very very good.I think Oscar has slightly more creativity, Firmino's probably better at taking defenders on, and he puts in the work rate and defensive shift necessary that Jose demands Oscar do for us. 

He's probably the only player that if some ridiculous offer came in for Oscar that we couldn't refuse, I wouldn't be mad if we got him.
