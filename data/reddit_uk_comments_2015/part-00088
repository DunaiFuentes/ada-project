Martinez is sticking with his philosophy because he feels that the work done now will benefit us in the long run.

The problem is obviously that doing as badly as we are right now may hinder our future - if players feel strongly enough about finishing so low in the table then we might lose them, and relegation will surely lose us some key players.

The main focus right now is our future, clearly, and I would theoretically be fine with a low finish in the league if it meant long term success. Building for the future is why we seem to be seeing an illogically stubborn Martinez, but it's hard to excuse the fixable aspects to our game that haven't been improved, such as our awful looking defence.

TL;DR: Martinez is being so stubborn this season because he thinks it will benefit us in the long term - as long as we're not relegated, it's not so bad to me.",null,0,null,1425755428,null,0,false,0,cp7gd65,null,t3_2y9dmf,null,t1_cp7gd65,null,t3_2y9dmf,null,null,null,1427632029,null,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5,null

You may start seeing him next season as a substitute in non league games to start and if he performs well he may get more opportunities behind Walker.

If you're looking to meet people involved in the scene, check out any of the nights run by local promoters for your genre of interest at the various venues people have mentioned. The Music Exchange is a great place to start, since they stock records by a lot of local bands and artists, they also sell tickets to loads of gigs and other events. Leftlion is a great resource too, as others have mentioned.

Some of my personal favourite Nottingham bands/artists:

Sleaford Mods (getting pretty big these days)

So, wouldn't Coleman doing series 9 only make her equal the length of ""longest serving modern companion"", rather than taking the ""record"" solely as the article purports?

It's hard for a striker, especially a poacher type who doesn't dribble or create his own chances outside of off the ball positioning, to perform well when we park it against PSG. Even if we had Aguero or Suarez it wouldn't matter with how we played after we got that first goal against PSG.

2. As much as I love Drogba, I agree. He needs to be reduced to a late sub when we need some hold up play either because we're down with limited time. Remy should get the go in every other situation IMO.

3. I don't think Fabregas or Costa are being complacent at all. Fabregas hasn't been as effective because our midfield is getting dominated without Matic and he hasn't played well in the 10 role ahead of the double pivot we try occasionally. Costa's in a minor slump of form but you can never say he doesn't give effort. He plays hard every minute he's on even if he's not scoring.

4. Completely disagree about benching Oscar. He was inconsistent early on but he's in a good form now. Even when he's not at his best, he's still a key player in terms of his work rate. He makes that transition from defense to offense so smooth. He also works really well with Fabregas as they interchange positions quite often if you pay close attention. Willian is okay at the 10 role, but he's nowhere near as good as Oscar when it comes to going forward. He's better defensively, but Oscar offers much better dribbling in tight situations, passing and shooting. That one game where he was the 10 role for the last few minutes, he got the late winning came from the right wing, where Willian plays normally anyway. 

5. Ramires has gotten plenty of chances this season so don't know what you're talking about when it comes to getting a ""few games"" every now and then.

One of mine was raised as an indoor cat in this way. I took him in at age three, when the owner moved abroad, and six months later I moved to a location where it was suitable to let him out. I asked the vet: they said that he might show little interest in going out at all.

When I opened the door for him, he disappeared straight over the garden fence and was gone. I spent six hours terrified of what I'd done, before he came back for some food. From that day on, he's been a totally outdoorsy cat, staking out a big territory and becoming quite a prolific mouser.

So no, I don't think the ""doesn't know any different"" thing is reliable. The instincts are all there, waiting to kick in - as, indeed was moulting. His second winter of oudoor life, he grew a much thicker and softer coat, which hadn't previously happened.

Which means he is being a chicken shit unwilling to stand up and champion his principles against his primary rival.

&gt;

&gt;__The Hum__ is a phenomenon, or collection of phenomena, involving widespread reports of a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming, rumbling, or droning noise not audible to all people. Hums have been widely reported by national media in the UK and the United States. The Hum is sometimes prefixed with the name of a locality where the problem has been particularly publicized: e.g., the ""[Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol) Hum"" or the ""[Taos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos,_New_Mexico) Hum"".

&gt;Data from a Taos Hum study suggests that around two percent of the population could detect the Taos Hum. For those who can hear the Hum it can be a very disturbing phenomenon. Among those who cannot hear the hum and some specialists, there has been skepticism about whether it exists.

**Price of product:** £??? for 150ml

**Where did you purchase:**  Bodycare

**Product claims:** *""Our Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a perfect blend of multi-vitamins and gentle cleansers to keep your skin thoroughly cleansed and revived. Perfect for even sensitive skin.*

*Simple goodness... 2 Vitamins. Pro-Vitamin B5, Vitamin E. 0 No Artificial Perfume or Colour and No Harsh Chemicals. So it won't upset your skin. Simple ingredients... impressive results.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased so I have tried something I often recommend, and because it's practical to have a foaming wash I can easily pick up on the high street.

**Your opinion:** I am using this on my hands and potentially smelly parts of the body, not my face. I have been using other foaming products free of anionic surfactants for the last four years (most recently Weleda Baby Calendula shampoo &amp; body wash).

This is a really basic formula which does exactly what it says on the tin. Why the Simple moisturising wash is based on SLES instead of coco betaine like this one is a mystery to me. The refreshing wash cleanses gently but effectively, has not aggravated my long dormant eczema nor caused my cuticles to split as other foaming washes do, feels less stripping than the Weleda product. Really happy with it and will definitely repurchase.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, cocamidopropyl betaine, propylene glycol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium chloride, panthenol, vitamin E, pantolactone, sodium hydroxide, citric acid, disodium EDTA, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate.""*",null,0,null,1425763960,null,0,false,0,cp7kj6j,null,t3_2icnkb,null,t1_cp7kj6j,null,t1_cl6s6lx,null,null,null,1427634064,null,1,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,1,null

I.e. we need electricity, this way of life, so we need people to shovel the coal for example. We need farmers, for food etc.

So wouldn't things be a lot better basic needs like that were addressed by automation, in theory? And only having a few people who'd inspect the technology from time to time.

I don't know what kind of political society managing thinking this is, but the problem is rooted in having a capitalist society in which you need people doing ""shit jobs"" - coal shovelling, in order to provide us with the basic living needs (health, food shelter). And so money is the motivator for it.

But have technology come in, and that could change. Getting off money being the motivator for humans to do things. So for basic things like health, food, shelter. We need technology to sort it out. So what would people be doing in their own time instead? Entertainment I guess.

Well that's highly idealised, and technology can't replace an actual doctor, there will always be  some things that people will need to go into work to do.

In which case... keep the system of money, maybe give all people equal living wages, and let them do what they want that provides value to society, and if it runs out/haven't found an area of which they can give value, they'll have to do the ""tedious jobs""/the jobs that are necessary for basic human needs.

I think the results of the survey are massively distorted by the fact this subreddit has a comparatively large number of Scottish users relative to the UK total and they clearly are more in favour of an SNP-Labour coalition as their preferred outcome. 44 people out of about 180 suggested they wanted to see a labour-SNP coalition... and I can't see many people in England wanting that. Infact, national polls suggest the English are fairly unanimous in their distrust and dislike of the SNP. 

Personally though I doubt it will happen. It isn't 2010 anymore, parties are wiser to the perils of a modern coalition after the pasting the lib dems have taken. It also won't serve labours long term interests to entrench the SNP as the ""party of Scotland"" by effectively signaling that by working with the SNP they give voters north of the border little reason to vote for them directly. Finally it could prove devastating to Labours hopes of expansion in England if they are seen to be propping up an unpopular (in England) Scottish party.

There are extremely valid reasons for thinking this 'Cameron is scared of Ed' theory is complete tosh. The trick is to look at Ed, to read what he writes, and listen to what he has said, and instantly the theory is debunked.

Ed is the worst mainstream candidate for PM in memory. He has been a non stop slow motion car crash. Love em or hate them, Blair and Brown were big alpha dogs and they commanded respect.

Ed commands zero respect from anybody and gets routinely abused in parliament. Had it been Blair or Brown, there is absolutely no way that Cameron would be so nonchalant. 

If he debates Ed one on one, he will have to debate Nick and Nigel too. 

Nigel is the one he wants to avoid, as thats the debate where he can lose votes from. 

I think British politics are quite entrenched right now, and there are not so much left to right swings in voters or vice versa, but rather inter-left and inter-right re-positioning. 

Thats what Cameron fears, as if he loses voters to Farage, and has to enter coalition with UKIP on their terms the Europe question that he is keen to avoid/fudge becomes very real and he will be in Gov with a very vocal eurosceptic group, when he is quite openly pro-europe.

Cameron doesn't need to care about Labour. After the Scottish referendum a slow process of strategic contraction was set in motion that probably will lead to long term marginalisation.

keep an eye on it every few days. 

general sale usually happens 3 weeks before and late availability 3 days before? might be a bit off but the sale dates will be displayed closer to the time.

for both games you should be alright as they aren't really one of the 'big' teams (historically Newcastle possibly...) but a word of advice not only to try and do your best to get into the sale queue ASAP (usually at 8.15 am UK time of the day of the sale) but if it says that a game is sold out keep refreshing and refreshing the page and seats will appear (it's best to buy them on a PC and not a mobile device) ...

I don't have membership this season as I'm at university now but I've managed to go to spurs city and Burnley all through general sale, I'd say in late availability its probably even easier and you said you have membership so you'll qualify for that also. 

I think spurs and newcastle should be similar sale wise, I got into the sale on time and had no problem choosing a good seat whereas in the city sale I got in on time but spent over an hour, eventually getting 2 seats after constant refreshing... you should be ok for these games but I would say be prepared to possibly not be sitting next to each other - not that it really matters, Anfield is the type of ground where you can pretty much start a conversation with any other fans, even during the match

null,false,JimmothyTwinkletoes,null,null,null,"I disagree. I think the problem is mainly with the players but not just defensively. 
I think our problem is that our midfield lacks aggression both offensively and defensively. Silva is scared to shoot, Yaya is lazy, 'Dinho likes yellow cards, Fernando is always waiting for the perfect time to put in a challenge and then ends up making a last ditch tackle which is easily walked around by the person who is trying to tackle it. Navas is extremely one dimensional, which lets the defense know exactly what he is gonna do and be ready for it. Nasri is probably well-rounded in terms of attacking but can sometimes disappear from matches. We cant count on getting goals from our midfield which means that without a second striker teams can crowd Agüero and let us pass around until someone misplaces a pass and gets a break. And some people think we should go 4-2-3-1, apparently because they don't watch us play. The only time we seem to get some aggression from our midfield is when all of our strikers are injured and they are forced to action. 

To further complicate things, Kompany and Mangala both like charging forward to meet attackers in the middle third. When they flub up the tackle it leaves us outnumbered in our own goal, which is a bad situation to be in. With 2 Demichelis' in the back four I would bet our defense would look very good. Not trying to shit on Kompany or Mangala though, as I think they are both very good players deserving of a place on the team. Mangala is also super young and Demichelis seems to be the perfect person for him to learn from.

* The ability to monitor content. When someone calls you, the phone company just sees this number -&gt; this number. When someone emails you, we have the entirety of the content available to use to perform techniques like [bayesian analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering), or just straight up 'oh this idiot again' direct blacklisting of certain phrases, etc.

* It's not realtime. This means we can do things like greylisting, where we say 'you've never mailed this customer before, so we reject your message - if you're not a spammer, come try again in 3 hours' and tarpitting where we say 'ok we will accept your message, but at a ridiculously slow speed (which might be acceptable for one legit message, but infuriating for 10000 spam messages). You can't really make these sort of tradeoffs with a realtime phone conversation.

* We don't have an obligation to deliver emails. I'm not sure if the phone companies are legally obligated to connect calls if possible but I suspect they might be. Obviously this wouldn't apply if they are spammers, but as you know sometimes legit emails end up in that spam pile by accident - I don't know if, if this happened with calls, the telco would get in the shit.

* Spam is illegal (for some definition of spam). Cold calling isn't, if you're not on the do not call list, as far as I know. Who defines what to block?

What would be interesting is if we could subscribe to a blocklist of numbers other people have reported as shitty callers, similar to a mail blacklist, and have those not reach us - you could do it yourself with a smartphone app of course (I bet they exist) but it would be nice if the telcos did it their end.",null,0,null,1425768966,null,0,false,0,cp7mv0q,null,t3_2y87sy,null,t1_cp7mv0q,null,t1_cp7il6f,null,null,null,1427635150,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If Miliband indicates a willingness to take a deal with the SNP, it will undoubtedly fast track the break up on the UK. No politician wants that on their CV. Half of Ed's own front bench are saying the same thing.

Cameron has totally framed the subject now by speaking so openly on it. 

If Ed says he is open to an SNP deal then he can lose a lot of voters in England because the logical conclusion is that the UK will break up. He has already butchered his brothers career, and this will be the latest sign of personal ambition being put before national interest. 

The catch 22 is that without Scotland, Labour probably can never get in government again (as things stand).

If Ed rejects a future SNP deal, he is submitting to Cameron, even though its the logical decision, and even though it means he can kiss goodbye to his dreams of being PM.

Cameron is a lot of things, but he is not idiot, and I am very sure he does not have a single ounce of fear over sharing the stage one on one with Ed.

By not debating he is showing that he fears going in a 1v1.
Dont make the mistake that a live 90 minute 1v1 debate is the same as PMQs, they are vastly different formats with an live audience of politicians that lasts about 30 minutes. 
Cameron fears the format will work against him, that's why he doesn't want a debate, that's why he pushed for 7 leaders in a 90 minute debate.

Cameron is not having a 1v1 with farage, he is supposed to be having 2 7way debates and a head to head with milliband.
He does not need to have a 1v1 with any other leader as they are not the primary opposition party by size.

He is quite obviously a chicken shit cowering from debate because he thinks it wont go his way.

""Fibre"" can mean anything FTTx technology, from FTTN (fibre to the node/neighbourhood) right down to FTTD (fibre to the desktop). Although it's generally faster than copper due to fibre being able to be run a longer distance without losing speed as much as copper, it isn't an indication of your connection speed, just of the technology used locally by your ISP.

Exactly which one works out cheapest depends on how you want to invest - how much, how often, what type of investment.

Amy Pond: 34 episodes (I am not counting Pompeii and Time of the Doctor here, for obvious reasons)

Clara Oswald: 39 episodes (this includes Asylum, again for obvious reasons)

An explanation on how I got to 39 episodes. This is based off of the assumption that Season 9 will have 13 episodes and a Christmas special. It has already been confirmed that Coleman will be in the entirety of Season 9 so there is no debate there. For arguments sake, let's say S9 only has 12 and she doesn't appear in the Christmas special. That still leaves her run at 37 episodes. 

Why include Asylum of the Daleks? Well, she may be ""Oswin"" but she's still an offshoot of Clara. They are technically one and the same. So it's fair game. You can't include Pompeii for Amy because Amy has no relation to the soothsayer. It's a completely separate role.

If there were a one on one debate between Cameron and Milband, what would you say Milbands big point scoring subjects would be?

He has been the dampest leader of opposition in living memory, and the nation has suffered for it. 

There is literally nothing Ed can say to Cameron. Literally, nothing. 

At every opportunity to spread out an alternative to coalition policy, he has fluffed his lines. Its been a car crash leadership.

Scenarios

1) Cameron has no fear of Ed. He fears that if he opens up to Ed one on one, he will have to do it to Nick and Nigel, and Nigel is the guy who can take votes from him.

Politics are entrenched and Cameron will only lose votes to UKIP, not to Labour.

If UKIP get more votes, they have a strong negotiating hand when it comes to coalitions. Remember the party is devoted to leaving the EU and Cameron is pro EU. 

Look how he behaves in Brussels when he feels the heat from his back benchers and UKIP. 

2) He second fear is that if he shares a stage with just Nick, Nigel and Ed, Nigel will drain votes, while the Lib Dems are not a threat to Labour. 

Same conclusion as above. 

3) If he shares a stage with Labour, Liberal Democrat, UKIP, Green, SNP, and Plaid Cymru, then both Tory and Labour are at risk of losing votes.

Actually, its the fairest solution. The fact that Labour oppose this reeks of insecurity.

Labour are fighting for their life in Scotland, and without Scotland, they can kiss goodbye to ever being in Government again. 

This should tell you all you need to know.

Nobody is scared of debating Miliband. He is a North London Liberal equivalent of Tim Nice But Dim. The lights are on but nobody is home.

1. By attending a debate (or two debates) that Cameron refused to attend, he's showing he's got more guts than Cameron, who's his main competition.
1. Ed's been howling at Cameron all week to take part in the debates, so he'd look like a hypocrite if he failed to show up.
1. The broadcasters appear to be willing to empty-chair Cameron, so it's possible they'd do the same to Ed, leaving two empty chairs and a whole load of insurgent, anti-politics candidates getting to point the finger and say 'See? They're all the same!' without anyone there to tell them otherwise (note that they can - and would - also do this even without a debate if both Cameron and Miliband duck out, just not from quite the same platform).
1. On this note, Ed can say 'See? We're *not* all the same. I turned up to face the public and my opponents and Cameron didn't'.
1. Ed's got to take on the SNP and Greens to win and this is a great, very public platform from which to do so.
1. As lots of people have pointed out, the general public think Ed is a total spaz. If he manages anything better than falling over and/or crying, he'll be seen as having 'defied expectations' and come out looking good.

And specifically with regard to Farage:

1. Nigel Farage debated Nick Clegg head-to-head. Ed will be up there with five or six other people, so it won't be just Nige vs. Ed. It's a totally different dynamic.
1. Nigel Farage debated Nick Clegg specifically on the EU, where he's very strong. In this debate, there'll be mutliple issues and multiple voices. Farage won't be as strong on all of them.
1. Even if Nigel Farage does do well from the debates, he'll take more votes from the Tories than from Labour, so it's worth a gamble.

If someone is happy to risk it then that is their choice, roaming cats do a good job of keeping down rats and mice. Unlike the USA small cats are native to this country- up until 200 years ago or thereabouts wild cats could be found all over Britain which is one peeve the USAers have with roaming cats. Americans also have less in the way of charitable societies that spay and neuter for free or cheap for people on benefits, we are lucky here with the PDSA, Blue Cross and RSPCA as well as some vets who will provide this service too, so they have a huge unwanted cat population problem. The unwanted cat problem does exist in this country but I think a lot of that is Landlords increasingly not allowing pets.

There is NOT going to be a one on one debate due to Camerons weakness. 

Everything else is just a hypothesis.  But the only facts we have now are that
1, Milliband wants a one v one debate and he is confident of a positive outcome. 
2, Cameron does not want a one v one debate and we can only deduce that is because he predicts a negative outcome.

No other factors come into play here. Outside of the Tory central office nobody gives a fuck about labour and SNP being in a coalition. These factors, ironically could be debated in a 1v1 if Cameron had any balls.

null,false,TheViagraKid,null,null,null,"Some of this is typical, some of it isn't. I'll just go through the list for you.

* Strict full suit-and-tie dress code - **Yes, this is true for most schools.**

* Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.  - **I've been to a couple of schools. 50% did this. 50% did not.** 

* There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house. - **well...a state school doesn't have boarding students. So no.**

* There is a captain/prefect for each house - **If houses exist, then yes, this is usually the case.**

* Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.) - **It depends how ingrained the house system is. Some do. More probably don't bother.**

* There are many inter-house competitions. - **Same as above, it depends on the house system and how key it is to the school. In my experience, if there's a house system, then yes there's many competitions.**

* There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school - **i believe this is standard yes.**

* ""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"") - **Not that I'm aware of. Never come across that anyway. We had double classes but it was never ""with..."".**

* Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin - **Not in a state school, in selective (grammar schools) or private schools.**

* Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc. - **In the more prestigious grammar &amp;amp;amp; private schools, definitely yes. Not so much in newer comprehensives.**

* Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils - **always - in terms of we called teachers by their last names. Teachers would refer to students mostly by their forenames, but sometimes (seemingly randomly, although on reflection when they were a bit pissed off with us) would refer to us by our surnames too.**

Most of the things you refer to are all common in a prestigious grammar school or in one of the ""public schools"" (which is, ironically, not public, it's very high-fee-paying, elitist etc.). One or two are common throughout the state school system too.

Harry Potter reminds me of my time in a top grammar school - everyone was incredibly gifted, but also phenomenally naive and arrogant. We had houses and competitions and there was a vague animosity towards people in the ""rival"" house(s). We studied things that to be honest would never really come in handy for most of us (like Latin). We had ancient traditions and were always told about our heritage, the successes of alumni, had school songs and several events a year purely for traditions sake. But you did feel proud to be there.

I found that the state schools cared more about keeping everyone happy (ie; allowing everyone to mingle through different classes and such) but also dividing by ability. Eg; rather than having classes in our ""houses"" (they were pretty much non-existent in the one I attended the most), we had them in ""sets 1-4"" 1 being the most intelligent, 4 being the least.

But as I said, things like uniforms &amp;amp; calling teachers ""Miss ..."", ""Mr..."" Or simply ""Miss/Sir/Ma'am"" is common throughout the education system in the UK.

A lot of those things are exclusive to private or public (by which I mean super elite, expensive, ancient) schools, not your bog standard state (government-controlled) school. Hogwarts is definitely meant to be a public school, not a state school. 

The vast majority of British state school students will wear a uniform, which normally includes a shirt and tie. Some have houses, but you'll take classes with your form rather than your house, and the housing system is *generally* quite ambigous anyway. You might have a house captain though, yes, and school Sports Days in the summer might well involve inter-house sports competitions. 

You get common rooms once you reach Sixth Form (ages 17/18) but I certainly didn't have a common room earlier than that, and any spare time during breaks was spent in our form room. I'm pretty sure we had Head Girls (I went to an all girls school), and double classes were pretty common. You mixed with other forms once you went into your GCSE (exam) years because classes were optional, so they mixed us together to make up the numbers. 

I went to a grammar school, which was more academic than most state schools and required passing an exam to enter, so my answer is subjective but yes, we had a lot of Classics lessons available. It was compulsory to study Latin from years 7-9, and optional from there. I took Classical Civilisation for Sixth Form, so I had a lot of education on the classics. This is definitely not the case for most British state school students, but it's more common at private schools. 

Some schools have traditions, others don't. Ancient public schools like Harrow are all about the traditions and school songs. Mine had a Latin motto, and a few traditional assemblies, but that was about it. As for teachers, we were allowed to call them ""Dr Gwyther"" or ""Mrs Bennet"" rather than Miss or Sir, and they call us by our first names, never surname.

Since he became leader, opposition policy has been all over the place. They've changed tack on economic policy at least three times, his big policy announcements like the energy price freeze and cutting tuition fees quickly unravelled, and his major relaunch of his leadership under the One Nation Labour brand has now seemingly been retired as not fit for purpose. Not to mention his one foreign policy test was a debacle when he pledged the government his support for action against Assad and then changed his mind after Parliament had been recalled, pissing off our allies in the process. But my favourite example of him ""sticking to his policies and not changing with the wind"" is when he took his principled stand against Murdoch only to then pose like a grinning idiot with a copy of The Sun only to *then* issue a grovelling apology for doing so.

The incomers had to ""adhere to our standards and to our way of behaving"" and, if they did so, would be welcomed, Mr Blunkett argued.

With Ed and Eastern Europeans, all I could find was something where he said ['By focusing exclusively on immigration's impact on growth, we lost sight of who was benefiting from that growth - whose living standards were being squeezed. We became disconnected from the concerns of working people.'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18539472) That's hardly on the same level as saying you would be worried living next door to Romanian people. 

I couldn't find anything about Straw and Palestinian gangs. 

I found an [article](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/12/ukcrime.race) about Blair blaming knife crime on 'black culture', and while I also completely disagree with what he said, i the article itself lists opposition from within his own party, and I would struggle to find anyone on this subreddit who would oppose Farage and UKIP but agree with these comments. That makes it different from Farage's comments, who his supporters were very happy to either defend or agree with. 

It's a similar situation with Abbott. Everyone knows she's a burk. 

You're claim that these comments aren't remembered is rubbish. The first two I couldn't find on the internet. The third is because people remember of lot of other negative things about Blair (mainly relating to the Iraq war). With the fourth, many people, like myself, do remember a lot of the racist bollocks Abbott says, and use it as a reason to oppose her. 

&gt; Farage does not physically get in the face of immigrants and call them names when they are in a place they are not allowed to leave without being disciplined. 

No, but his comments very much influence those who do.

There's usually a common room for the 6th form (aged 16-18). State schools are not boarding schools, all pupils are day pupils.
&gt;Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)
There are many inter-house competitions.

never personally knew a school with a house system

&gt;There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

Yes, that's common

double classes, yes, especially as you you got older, but  not the house thing, again, not in my experience.

The uniform at my schools was black shoes, black socks, black suit trousers (short trousers for early primary years), white shirt, school tie, black v-neck jumper, school blazer. Most people didn't bother with the blazer and just wore an outdoor coat or jacket over their jumper and took it off in class.


&gt; Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

Both my schools had houses but those were purely for school sports. In primary and early secondary you took all your classes with the same people (your form class) and from mid-secondary onwards you took classes with the people who had chosen the same subjects as you.

&gt; There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

No boarders at my schools. Common room was for Sixth Year (final year of secondary) pupils only.

&gt; There is a captain/prefect for each house

My secondary had prefects but they weren't house-specific. I think they were just Sixth Years that the teachers liked. They got to wear blazers with piping on them in the school colours.

&gt; Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)

We probably would have done if my school had even been slightly sporty. We didn't have enough people interested to get much inter-house sport going, and the only inter-school stuff I remember happening was field hockey, chess and orchestra.

&gt; There are many inter-house competitions.

We only really had the dreaded ""school sports day"".

&gt; There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

We had a head boy and girl, plus a few other prefects.

&gt; ""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")

At secondary, the school day was divided up into eight 40-minute periods. You could have a 40-minute ""single"" class or an 80-minute double one. Again, these would either be with your form class or your chemistry class or whatever, not house-related.

""The capacity of our economy to absorb new migrants has outrun the capacity of some of our communities to adapt,

 


In a speech in Chatham ahead of next month's Rochester and Strood by-election, Mr Miliband was set to pledge a Labour Government to bring in exit checks to count all immigrants in and out of the UK.

Labour's Immigration Bill would also force all public facing staff in Government to speak good English.

He was expected to say the plans would offer a ""clear, credible and concrete"" change in Britain's immigration policy, and to make promises that he can keep on immigration.

The Bill would also

- make it illegal for employers to bring in foreign workers to undercut the wages of British staff;

- ban recruitment agencies from only hiring foreign workers, and ignore Britons;

- to force any large employers who hire foreign workers to have to take on a similar proportion of apprentices.

Jack Straw: ""We need to get the Pakistani community to think much more clearly about why this is going on""


Former Home Secretary Jack Straw has been accused of ""stereotyping"" after suggesting some men of Pakistani origin see white girls as ""easy meat"".

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/08/jack-straw-white-girls-easy-meat


Im not going to get into a protracted debate. I have had it several times on my old account. Someone else said 'oh its one way; only UKIP do X, then someone came up with hundreds of linked articles of blunders, gaffes, racism, homophobia, wife beatings' 

And no, it does not stick in peoples minds.

People will rotinely do the ' hurr durr they terk err jerbs, living 10 to a room pushing down our wages' sctick and will get voted to the high heavens stating that its impossible to work for less than the minimum wage, when ed, straw and other have said immigration and multi culturalism has failed. it pushes down wages and living standards, makes it harder to get a job, pressure on services. and none og his acolytes hear it. 

All the shit he is saying about making them speak english and cracking down on sub minimum wage is dog whistling when fargage says it supposedly.

I'm pretty sure there is a train that runs every hour from inside of Manchester Airport to Lime Street, buy an open return ticket, don't think it'll cost you more than £20 each. 

The Adelphi hotel is a 2 minute walk from Lime Street, and there's a couple of others around the city all in good walking distance from Lime Street, I can't really recommend any because I've never used a hotel here before. 

Like the other guy said, you need to visit the Cavern Club(the real one), if you're lucky you might get to take in some live music, it's amazing in there. The official LFC shop in Liverpool One is boss if you're looking for souvenirs. There are a bunch of different museums if you like that sort of stuff. The docks are nice to walk around and there are some decent little shops there.

If you're looking to go out at night, try and visit the Kazimier Garden, it's probably my favourite bar in Liverpool, it's really unique and something I'd recommend to anyone visiting, there's a load of other bars nearby in Concert Square too, great prices. 

You might be able to book(online in advance) an Anfield stadium tour on the Saturday they pretty cheap and you get to see inside Anfield, in the players lounge, dressing rooms, down the tunnel and the dugout, there's also a museum inside of Anfield that is definitely worth a visit.

* Yes - You could get sent to detention/get a punishment exercise for not wearing uniform and sent home if done often enough), first to fourth years wore black trousers (or black skirt for girls), white button up shirt, black jumper, burgandy tie with gold school name lettering, black shoes. 5th and 6th years had unique dress code: Black trousers (or skirts for the girls), white button up shirt, black blazer with burgundy/gold edge decals + embroided school badge, turqouise tie with gold stripe and school badge. The only exception was PE, there was apparently a mandatory kit of Burgundy Shorts + Sky blue top + trainers but those were shit colours (sorry West Ham) and no one bought it or would wear it. For swimming black/navy trunks for boys or 1 piece swimsuit for girls was mandatory - no bikinis/shorts though boxer/jammer type trunks were allowed. Everyone brought their own kit in, because if you didnt you had to borrow kit from the school (funnily even they didnt have the ""official"" kit but instead had shit trainers, shit tops and shit shorts and for swimming some nice speedo briefs to wear. Refusing kit mean you'd be sent to a room called the ""Remove Room"" where you would have to sit with a depute head teacher and write punishment exercises over and over for an hour and if done often enough excluded.
* Yes - There were 3 houses at my school (Though I've heard they have since changed to 4 houses from younger student friends) Every pupil was given a circular badge with their house colour on it (Gold/Yellow, Burgundy or Turqouise) + gold edges, and were expected to wear them - no one did, and no one gave a fuck... until 5th and 6th year :P 
* Yes - Multiple common rooms (3), not assigned to houses, but were assigned by year group (1st+2nd years, 3rd + 4th years and 5th+6th years) Though in my 5th and 6th years the 1st/2nd year common room was turned into a hair/beauty salon (I shit you not, this really happened) and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years has a shared common room. Was never used as most people preferred to go outside during lunch and this was really the only feasible time you could go to the common rooms (it was shut during break (but not the 5th and 6th years! :) )
* Yes - Multiple prefects, 1 house captain, and school wide 1 depute head boy+girl and 1 head boy+girl. Prefects were given badges to wear (Red shield with gold edges + Embossed gold ""Prefect"" lettering) Heads+Deputes+Captains also had unique badges
* Yes interhouse competitions existed but no one took them seriously. A points system apparently existed.
* Initially classes were seperated by house as there were a lot of pupils and the high school had to gauge where each pupil was skill wise but eventually mixed based on student performance rather than house group. 
At the start of high scool you would be assigned a registration group and a house. As an example the school had Houses A,B,C and each house would have a class 1, 2, or 3 and would be seperated by year group. That means first year pupils would get assigned to class: 1C1(Year 1, House C, Class 1) or 1B3(Year 1, House B, Class 3). And each class for each year group might have had diffferent lessons at different times (E.g. class 1B3 might have PE while 1B1 had RME etc). You also could have double lessons i.e. back to back lessons in the same subject but my school tried to phase these out for everything except English and Maths, as having a 1 hour and 45 min lesson was hated by both pupils and teachers alike. The school day was divided into Registration(8:45 to 8:55, Period 1 8:55 to 9:50, Period 2 9:50 to 10:40, Break 10:40 to 11:00, Period 3 11:00 to 11:55, Period 4 11:55 to 12:45, Lunch 12:45-13:40, Period 5 13:40 to 14:35 and Period 6 14:35 to 15:30. So you might have got double English for period 2 and 3 or double maths from period 5 and period 6 ON A FRIDAY GOD DAMNIT!
* Not sure what you term ""classics"", There were several mandatory subjects, English, Maths, 1 Foreign Language(French or German), 1 social subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies(Politics)), 1 Science (Physics, Chemistry or Biology), and students had 3 own personal choices from any of the following: Music, Art, Drama, Graphic Communication(We'd call this Techy drawing) Craft and Design Technology(Building shit, this was nicknamed Techy), Computing, Information Systems, Business Education, Home Economics (Basically cooking and sewing), Media Studies, Drama), 3rd and 4th years were required to study 8 subjects, 5th/6th years 5, and 6th years 4 and every year had to take PE, Religous &amp; Moral Education (RME) up until 4th year and Social Education (Basically sex ed, drugs ed, career advice and other important shit no one cared about) for every year.
* At some schools definately, not mine as it hadn't been around that long. I doubt school songs exist though except for the really posh ones. The only sort of tradition if you can even count it, more of a respectful act, was I think we held a minutes silence for a former pupil who died serving in Iraq(or maybe Afghanistan) each year (who also had a Plaque installed in our assembly hall) and whos funeral became a bit of a hit online after his best friend and army collegue made a promise to wear a bright green or pink dress to the funeral so that they would keep each other alive to avoid embarrasment, and he sadly had to honour that request. We had an annual sports day and an awards ceremony every term for pupils who performed well that term.
* Yes teachers are on last name basis, even if you know their first name. But it casually devolved to calling teachers ""Sir"" or ""Miss""

Enrique is going to continue to stay as well because of his usefulness in bringing the squad together and how he has become a mentor to Moreno, Manquillo, and Flanagan.

Several years ago I had a sort of similar experience. I owned a custom vehicle that required custom vehicle insurance- very expensive, limited mileage insurance. Given that this was just before the internet was ubiquitous I searched through the pages of a popular custom vehicle magazine and located a broker who specialised in that type of insurance. I opted to pay by monthly instalments to spread the cost.

Fast forward a couple of months and, due to my own stupidity, I got banned from driving for a while. This was a major problem as it meant that I lost my job- and therefore had to cut back rather severely on my expenses at short notice. One obvious expense that could be cut was the vehicle insurance.

I rang the broker and asked them to cancel the insurance. They were only too happy to do this, but then explained that I would still be liable for all the payments, as what I had agreed to was not instalment payments, but a credit agreement.

Well colour me surprised! I used some ""choice"" language at that point and they hung up on me. Personally I didn't think it fair that I should continue to pay for cover I wasn't getting for a vehicle I was prohibited from driving.

I then wrote a letter to the custom vehicle magazine- the one where I had seen the advert for the broker- outlining the situation much as I have above and asking for advice. I didn't name the broker other than as ""a broker who advertises in the pages of this magazine"" which, to be honest, made it pretty obvious who I was talking about. I asked whether this sort of treatment was ethical- I had no doubt it was legal- what my next steps should be and whether I should contact the insurance ombudsman or consumer groups.

Next thing I knew, I received a letter from the broker the next month apologising for the ""mix-up"" and with a cheque enclosed refunding the previous three months' payments.

This was very welcome as I was basically broke, so that's as far as it went to the best of my knowledge- I couldn't really afford magazines either, so stopped buying them. However I mentioned this story to a friend I knew from the custom vehicle scene, and he said, ""Wait, so you're Chive from Essex?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you write that letter to [name of magazine]?"" ""Yes"" ""Oh man, you should have seen the shitstorm that kicked off on the letters page after that.""

Unfortunately sometimes that's what it takes to get treated reasonably, and since then I have nothing but contempt for insurance companies and the whole insurance industry.",null,0,null,1425791795,null,0,false,0,cp7wy0z,null,t3_2y87sy,null,t1_cp7wy0z,null,t1_cp76esp,null,null,null,1427639974,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

&gt;Strict full suit-and-tie dress code

Mine was black smart trousers, smart shoes, polo shirt and jumper uniform. They experimented with the full blazer and tie getup but the families who were in the catchment area couldn't afford to buy it.


&gt;Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

This is a posh, private education thing predominantly. We had each year divided up into manageable, classroom-sized chunks so we could be taught efficiently, and after around age 13, divided up according to ability, but no House Gryffindor, House Hufflepuff stuff. That always makes me think of over-privileged people being groomed for Oxbridge.


&gt;There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

No. There was a 6th form common room that was just a spare classroom that only 6th formers (sort of high school, 16-18yo) could sit in rather than shivering out in the rain at dinner. Nobody used it. The majority of us left school at 16 and went to a college (not University - college) instead.


&gt;There is a captain/prefect for each house

Private education / boarding school thing. Not a comp thing.


&gt;Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)

Ignoring the House thing, the Captain of whatever team was chosen in the same way any captain is chosen, according to sport rules. Nothing to do with how the school was run.


&gt;There are many inter-house competitions.

Another house thing. Irrelevant to me and most schoolkids in the country.


&gt;There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

Another posh private school concept.

&gt;""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")
Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin

I'm going to ignore the house concept from now on as it doesn't exist outside of old public boarding schools generally and the majority of schoolchildren don't ever come into contact with it. ""Double"" classes happen though, the day was divided up into periods of around 40 minutes, due to scheduling and making sure everyone got the full curriculum of lessons sometimes they were doubled up. Rarely ever had a single period lesson actually.

&gt;Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.

In centuries old public schools, you will get centuries old traditions. Not so much in your average school.


&gt;Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")

Sometimes. In my school teachers addressed the students by first name, and we addressed them by Mr/Mrs Surname.

&gt;In-depth study of European and British history from the Byzantine Empire up to about 1945 or so

Depending on what's currently in the curriculum. We do seem to be taught a lot more in-depth world history than the average American I've spoken to.

&gt;I may or may not have picked these up from the Harry Potter series.

I can tell. The Harry Potter books describe what it would be vaguely like^^^1 to go to a very old, traditional, expensive boarding school for the traditional upper class, certainly nothing like what us dirty unwashed masses go through.

&gt;A __fish__ is any member of a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic) group of organisms that consist of all [gill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill)-bearing [aquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal) [craniate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniate) animals that lack [limbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy\)) with [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_(anatomy\)). Included in this definition are the living [hagfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish), [lampreys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey), and [cartilaginous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrichthyes) and [bony fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bony_fish), as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are [ectothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm) (""cold-blooded""), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [white shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_shark) and [tuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna) can hold a higher core temperature.   Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [char](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvelinus) and [gudgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudgeon_(fish\))) to the [abyssal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssal_zone) and even [hadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal_zone) depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., [gulpers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulper) and [anglerfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish)). At 32,000 species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.

The fact is we would have preferred a move to Battersea because it could be built whilst we were still using the Bridge. We could also claim to be a part of a London icon as soon as we move in, something that can't really be said of any of the newer london stadiums. And that the time frame for the move would have been massively preferable.

Mainly Boris fucked us by wanting it to be housing. Which definitely ruins the look of it imo.

Anyway it would have been a unique and iconic stadium. This argument about the history of our current stadium is a bit superfluous.

To expand the bridge beyond 50 thousand we are going to pretty much have to knock down as much of the surrounding area as possible. Dig it down, make sure that we solidify the foundations or something and ensure there isn't a water table problem. Expand all the exits, expand the tube station routes. Quite probably take over the rail yard and all whilst keeping the Chelsea pensioner buildings the same and keep the Cemetery the same.

As it is there are enough concerns about Chelsea's viability with exit routes, new ones will have to be designed. The new stadium will probably have to hardly resemble the old one. I honestly can't see it looking anything like it is today. And when you're practically rebuilding you're entire location, nor should it look the same.

The history is wonderful but it shouldn't hinder us getting the best stadium possible in that location. Besides which, a rebuild of the Bridge requires at a minimum a 2-3 season stint outside the Bridge. All this talk of a year at twickenham was actually just us enquiring to use it and it's viability ffs. And certainly, given that it wouldn't happen for another 3 or 4 years, that's definitely a possibility, and one of the very few stadiums that actually are a possibility.

The only locations left aside from redeveloping Stamford Bridge are Earl's court and potentially Olympia. And I can't remember whether the council reviewed and scrapped the Earl's court development plans because it's been a while since I actually looked into our stadium move properly.

This question comes up a lot, should probably make an FAQ style thing available about it.

null,false,made_you_look88,null,null,null,"I work in the oil industry, and this is effecting me so much that I might lose my job. The price is so low that no exploration is really happening.

There are lots of theories floating around. But it all comes down to three things:

1) shale boom in the US pumping out 3 millions barrels per day more than before. The U.S. has expanded production by the equivalent of Venezuela over three years.
2) Saudi Arabia has opened the taps on its fields. 
3) world demand for oil is pretty muted, and this has led to a surplus of oil floating around.

So all of this is supply orientated, which is different to how the oil market used to work. OPEC is the cartel that made sure that oil supply was constricted enough to keep the price high, but since oil prices used to be pretty high, many players have entered the market and flattened the price again.

What is super interesting is that the opinion on Saudi Arabia is that it's the guy with its dick out pushing people around. But there's a theory floating around in the oil industry that actually, it's increasing production not through posturing, but through necessity. There's satellite evidence to show that the largest oil field in its inventory is starting to run out: 
http://satelliteoerthedesert.blogspot.com/?m=1

Maybe from a petroleum engineering point of view, it has to keep production running to get all the oil out?

Anyway, the petrol price you see is a mostly tax. Oil prices are still pretty low, but the petrol price mainly reflects tax.

The oil industry is cyclical, and in the near few years, we'll see a few mergers of companies, a few go bankrupt (look at Afren) but ultimately oil price will go back up to potentially $75 per barrel.

I genuinely don't see prices going to $100. The oil world is very different to how it used to be.

* The car on finance wasn't the best idea. Looks like you know that now. Car of that value also isn't great with at 15k pa salary. 

* Phone contract looks to have been unnecessarily expensive. Unless it was a 12 month contract including a phone! 

* Employee stock purchase plan. What are the terms of this? How long are you required to stay in the company etc? 

* Apple stocks. That looks like to have been your only equity purchase. Well aside from the employee stock purchase plan. Even though Apple has been pretty solid in the last 10 years, its still risky to only invest in one company. I would consider diversifying your investment. 

* Pension contributions look good if your employer is matching. 

&gt; should I put more into stocks

Probably not, considering you need access to your money in &lt;3 years for any such start up. Right now you don't have any real money you can access immediately. The first thing you should really do is try to save up an emergency fund, ideally 3.75-5k and just leave it in a cash account or a cash ISA depending on how the returns look when you actually have that amount of money. In fact I would consider liquidising your apple stocks for this purpose. 

*****

Right now you aren't exactly in a terrible financial situation. You have a bit of money, but nothing too substantial to do any serious investment with. Right now you need *access* to your money for any potential start up. Also avoid credit card/ cars on finance in the future. As for the car it may be something you may need to sell in the future.

&gt;In the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church), a __dogma__ is an article of faith revealed by God, which the [magisterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisterium) of the [Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) presents as necessary to be believed if one freely chooses to be a Catholic.  For example, Christian dogma states that the resurrection of [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ) is the basic truth from which salvation and life is derived for [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians). Dogmas regulate the language, how the truth of the resurrection is to be believed and communicated. One dogma is only a small particle of the living Christian faith, from which it derives its meaning.  Roman Catholic Dogma is thus: ""a truth revealed by God, which the [magisterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisterium) of the Church declared as binding.""  The *[Catechism of the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church)* states:

The brownfield site itself is huge, it was bigger than any other available area and perfect for our ambitions, we simply don't have the space the other top clubs have, such as the manchester clubs. Particularly City, as they basically developed a fairly shit and barren area too.

Vauxhall is vauxhall. But yeah the estates to the south are pretty shit I agree. The train lines are far from ideal. Only lines that may be diverted there are Northern and Victoria, even that's going to be strange as there will probably only be trains heading there for the match then. This is a much bigger problem imo. Although how Boris planned to cure any of that with his housing development I have no idea. 

(off on a tangent here)
Ideally, I'd quite like to pinch one of the Northern lines and add a route through the super busy central stations that runs south, somehow separating out the weird 2 northern line routes in the process and adding extra capacity to the central stations. I imagine it running through goodge street and probably picadilly circus and sloane square and then to the battersea park next door and then down to Clapham junction.

All of that would be pretty strategic for adding more passenger routes but I recognise it's impossibly unlikely to ever happen. Also because I'm missing out shit loads of complications, I just think that would help out the tube network a fair bit given how overcrowded the shopping areas often are for trains heading further out. Alternatively, something that wouldn't aim to relieve the central london stations could run from a picadilly station, across to a northern line station. But I'm rambling and apologise.  


Back to the area.
I kinda imagine the park would be quite nice and maybe a bit more developed. But saying that, the brownfield site was so large and the plans to build completely new tube stations so I don't think the plan was really for that many of the fans to leave the entire Battersea site that much. The current battersea station area could probably accommodate our entire stadium 3 times, such is the tiny footprint of the club buildings itself.

* Strict full suit-and-tie dress code

We had a school uniform, but it was basically white shirt, black trousers (skirts for the girls), and a blue and gold striped tie. That was it.

* Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

Houses yes, but it was only for some inter-house points gathering competition, of which the house I was in had won it yearly for something like 40 years. And still dominate it, from what I hear.

* There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

Didn't have boarding students, so wouldn't know.

* There is a captain/prefect for each house

Team of prefects, not just the one. There were something like 140 students per house, and I think 3 prefects from each year, along with a head prefect.

* Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)

Nope. Only inter-house competition was the points gathering. Anything else was drawn from the entire school

* There are many inter-house competitions.

Just the one.

*  There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

Yes. And a deputy. Although they were the go-between the governing body, and the prefects, who were /supposed/ to be the voice of the students.

* ""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")

Yes and no. Double classes, especially in GCSE years, but the classes weren't separated by house.

* Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin

Classics, only if you took Music (which I did)

* Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.

Not really. Other than the annual tie burning for Year 11 students, and a rather cute giving of a penny from that year on your birthday, there weren't really that many rituals.

* Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")

Other way around mainly. Teachers were always Mr, Miss, or Mrs, even the substitutes. All the way through Years 4 to 11, to the point where when I'd left school, about 4 years later, my Maths tutor came into the bar I was managing, and I immediately called her Miss Holmes.

Are you sure about that? And why would you think so?

As for there being a referendum, I think you'll find many rich and powerful lobbyists and corporations will fight tooth and nail to prevent an exit happening. The business opportunities are simply too great for them to allow something like the general public from interfering in their plans.

I know I probably sound like some conspiracy theorist but it is not in Big Business' interests to leave the EU. And considering many MPs have rather *strong* ties to Big Business I think any promise of a referendum will be quietly suppressed after the election, no matter who wins.

I actually think this election is important for rather different reasons. Coalitions are likely to become the norm, people have an opportunity to vote for either a person or politics (Cambo the person, Labour the politics) and as sad as it may sound to you, although UKIP may win a couple more seats they are hardly going to rock the boat. Is this the year that UKIP become significant? Nah, it's the year when people stop taking notice of them. In 2016 all eyes will be elsewhere.

Anyway, I sincerely hope that an exit doesn't happen as I would in all likelihood be deported from Sweden, only to find that instead of being a half decent research scientist I would have to pick fruit or work in a restaurant to make a living.",null,0,null,1425814163,null,0,false,0,cp82iu3,null,t3_2ybun1,null,t1_cp82iu3,null,t3_2ybun1,null,null,null,1427642576,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

There are often strict uniform dress codes specifying stuff like shirt colour/skirt length/tie length. Uniforms tend to be distinct between schools, and the top (Jumper or blazer) often has a school logo 


&gt;Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")

This is more common in boys' schools than in girls'.  Where I've seen it it's usually ""Hainsworth! Sit down!"" rather than ""Mr Hainsworth! Sit down!""

Double, to me, always meant extra-length lessons. So, say ""Double maths"" would be 2 hours of maths rather than the usual 1

2) There was only a common room for the 6th formers as they were the only ones with gaps in their timetable. It wasn't a boarding school so there was no need for extra space to study at weekends or evenings. 

3) There were prefects at my school.

4) There were sports captains for each house.

5) There was only really one main sports day a year which was between the houses. 

6) There was a head boy and girl for my school.

7) Some of my lessons were just with my tutor class which were people all from my house. Some lessons were mixed with one other house and the other two houses were mixed too. When it got to GCSE where we had a free choice of 4 subjects to pick, those classes were completely mixed between the 4 houses.

8) I've never studied any ancient language. We covered ancient history a bit at school. Although now i do some biology at university latin would've been useful.

9) No rituals.

10) At school we had to call teachers mr/miss/mrs and their last name. At 6th form when it was only 16-19 year olds it was just first names. 

11) There was a lot of English/European history studied. But I also covered the USA 1840-1890 in optional history class when I was 14-16. The Egyptians, discovery of the Americas and slave trade were also covered a couple of times.

He's not trying to avoid criticism, he's trying to avoid ""legitimizing"" Miliband as a potential Prime Minister by appearing next to him in a debate. He is comfortable with how the public see him at the moment. Doing a debate would cause him more electoral damage than not, he is probably calculating.

I can only imagine that this would not be a sympathetic programme - it couldn't be. The ideal solution would be to give this sort of programme to as many parties as possible - even the minor parties that should never have been invited to the debates in the first place, like the Greens.

If we could just have no debates, and one of these programmes for each leader, that would be the ideal solution.

Again, their voter base isn't just pensioners. Everyone loves this idea that to vote Tory you have to be old and clueless, but in reality most Tory voters are people who've saved money throughout their life and don't want to see it all disappear with an economically incompetent Labour Government. 

You might think Tory economic policy is disastrous but to anyone with money (bear in mind it's not some mortal sin to have worked hard and saved money) the idea of Ed Balls as chancellor of the Exchequer is a nightmare scenario.

The way France is going at the moment (with the rise of the NF), I would suspect a Brexit would inspire the French to have their own vote.

That being said, an EU referendum happening. Possibly.

&gt; I know I probably sound like some conspiracy theorist but it is not in Big Business' interests to leave the EU. And considering many MPs have rather strong ties to Big Business I think any promise of a referendum will be quietly suppressed after the election, no matter who wins.

I don't think its a conspiracy, everyone knows what the Big corporations would want in that situation.

&gt; and as sad as it may sound to you, although UKIP may win a couple more seats they are hardly going to rock the boat. Is this the year that UKIP become significant? Nah, it's the year when people stop taking notice of them. In 2016 all eyes will be elsewhere.

The longer an EU referendum is put off, the more UKIP will make ground, not in terms of seats, but in convincing the public that we should leave the EU. Its quite possibly in every pro-EU supporter to give a referendum relatively soon, because if the British public do vote No to leaving, then it will take the wind out of UKIPs sails.

&gt; Anyway, I sincerely hope that an exit doesn't happen as I would in all likelihood be deported from Sweden, only to find that instead of being a half decent research scientist I would have to pick fruit or work in a restaurant to make a living.

Just be sure to remember that Classic Who is a thing. Too many people forget that. Also, don't watch Classic Who all in order- watch individual stories first. A few good starting points are:
 
Pyramids of Mars- The 4th Doctor and Sarah Jane are probably the most popular Classic team.
 
Spearhead from Space- The first colour story and the first with the 3rd Doctor. From this story up until the next series, he is exiled to Earth.

I don't really like to live and work in Sweden, but it's all I can do seeing as the pharmaceutical industry is essentially collapsing in on itself in the UK. Within the last 5 years there have been closures by Pfizer (Sandwich), AstraZeneca (Charnwood and soon Alderley Park), Novartis (Horsham). Merck and Glaxo have shrunk considerably, I can't even remember if Eli Lilly still have a site in the UK. I moved to Sweden because that's where the work was.

Debates are fairer in the sense that the people challenging the candidates aren't very likely to be sympathetic to their cause, but in practice it just results in misrepresentations of other party's policies; televised debates' own brand of soundbites (""you can airbrush your face, but not your policies""), and very, very little detail. 

They are popular because of the entertainment value, and people believe entertainment value will bring in a larger audience and therefore help inform more people. This doesn't happen because as I said, debates have no real content. What they do is make uninformed people think they are informed, and thus they don't feel the need to inform themselves.

You would need to make sure an interview is impartial, because if they are major hour-long (or more) interviews with party leaders, there will be wide coverage of it and plenty of opinion on the debate available. The broadcasters would already be scrutinized a lot by the rest of the media, incentivized to make sure the interview is done properly.

National heritage is one of the biggest earners in this country because of tourism. If we keep writing fucking graffiti on it and shitting and pissing all over it, it wont be there another 50. 

People are saying this isnt a big deal, because it can be 'cleaned up'. If you're so happy with someone shitting on something because its not a big deal, lets all come to your house, shit on your lawn, and graffiti your car. 

ALL materials can be worn, believe it or not. Here's an image of bronze after it has been touched by thousands of people: http://runlorirun.typepad.com/.a/6a0105370299b6970c01676128da40970b-750wi

You've all seen steps worn down by hundreds of feet. You start spraying graffiti on it, putting chewing gum on it, the life expectancy dfrops dramatically. 

So no, people shouldn't be allowed to shit and piss around it, and we should be incredibly careful about preserving them. We can't just fucking repair them. 

So yeah, it is a big deal.

That bowl of miscellaneous brown goop you've presented might be labelled as ""chocolate pudding"" or similar, but in general pudding is a collective noun rather than a description of a singular item. 

Cake is cake. I think your description is pretty good already, I'd expand it to include any and every bread-like sweet baked foodstuff.  

Sponge can be the foamed polymer, the marine organism, or a specific type of cake.. IE Victoria Sandwich. A sponge cake is one with a fairly light crumb-structure, with a sweet and fairly neutral flavour.

Pie is a hard one to define.. It's either encased, or not encased in pastry, where pastry may or may-not be present... Mashed potato is sometimes used as a lid, or not.. A lot of things may be called a pie... You'll have to just get used to this...

So in general... 

**TL;DR:** Sponge is a cake, cake is a pudding, pudding is served after the main course but before the cheeseboard, and pie is an anomaly that we use to confuse foreigners.

Even got a few stranger bits of [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Celli_Ddu).

There are relics of past industry dotted all around the island, ranging from ancient mines to [obvious relics of the sea.](http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/72574/south-stack-1280-x-618.jpg&amp;width=1280&amp;height=618&amp;altimage=/assets/images/missing-image.jpg)

Obviously being an  [island you can't really](http://www.celticcruising.co.uk/Resources/Images/penmon%20point.jpg) get away from the sea.

[Plenty of big fancy homes,](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoNa7UlkQIw/maxresdefault.jpg) if that's your thing.

The island has some unique ecology - and it's not just sea birds, the island is one of the strongholds of the red squirrel for example.
The island is also notable for it's geology, it sounds like hyperbole but Anglesey is truly unique in some of it's geology - that's a bit more niche but if it's your thing then you won't be disappointed. 

Obviously Snowdonia is just over the [bridge,](http://www.photoforbeginners.com/users/2034/thm1024/1344329476_IMG_0160.JPG) where you've got views like [this!](http://i.imgur.com/ClpIPYU.jpg) (that photo is actually mine, not just shamelessly taken from the internet like the rest!)

Oh and if you're into aviation you are guaranteed to see some [Hawks knocking about](http://www.drivearchive.co.uk/xplanes/xtra/atah1.jpg) in summer, if not large or faster aircraft. 

Anglesey is a popular tourist destination, but there are so many places, things to do and things to see that are off the beaten path. Didn't appreciate it when I grew up there, but I'd recommend it to anyone on a sunny day (again, note: Sunny day. Don't bother during a winter storm, unless being blown over is your thing.)

Perhaps you don't have as many role models or mentors within the industry who can model the behaviours you need to demonstrate in order to succeed. Perhaps you're struggling because of that 'women who negotiate are seen as demanding compared to men' dynamic. There's a host of embedded sexism in the pay-gap that comes with why people choose to go into different careers, why they prioritise what they prioritise that cannot simply be equalised out by adjusting for profession and experience. 

The article says that women tend to go into careers close to their traditional familial role - i.e. jobs with flexible hours that are more likely to accommodate their obligations than 'ruthless meritocracies'. Until industries open up to differing ways of working, like engineering and IT, and do something to reverse unconscious bias, it's not a self-selection in terms of preference that guide women's choices, so much as it is 'is this somewhere I can do the job, get ahead, manage the other priorities I have'.

null,false,buried_treasure,null,null,null,"Pudding is probably the one that's most confusing you. That's OK, it's used to mean lots of different things in British English, and frequently you just have to work it out from context.

On one level ""pudding"" simply means ""dessert"" -- i.e. the final course in a typical three-course meal. Its use in this sense is regional, but quite widespread and commonplace: ""what are we having for pudding, mum?"" ... ""fruit salad and cream"" wouldn't be an unusual thing to hear. Other words for dessert include ""sweet"", ""afters"", and I'm sure there are others.

Pudding can also refer to a specific item. In this case it's usually prefixed with an additional word that makes it clear what's being referred to: suet pudding, sticky toffee pudding, yorkshire pudding. As you can see from the last item in that list, puddings don't have to be sweet, unlike pudding (the course) which nearly always will be.

Similarly with pies, which as I'm sure you've become aware does not exclusively mean something made with fruit fillings, as it tends to in the USA. In general a pie will be anything -- sweet or savoury -- wrapped in a pastry case and baked, so apple pie, steak &amp; ale pie, and chicken &amp; ham pie are all things.

Further to that, the word has evolved to mean things that aren't necessarily encased in pastry.

***The problem is that Premier League teams do not give Everton the same amount of time and space. High pressing from other teams leads to football being played in the first two thirds of the pitch, much like this defeat. Teams quickly close down the passing options while the absence of width and movement compounds the issue.

Everton are easy to defend against in this current state. Pressing traps them in their own half; sitting deep sees the narrow setup ploughing aimlessly into any defence with basic organisational skills. Arsenal did a mixture of both, and the result was a home win for a team able to coast over the line in second gear.

There is no reason for this incessant shoehorning of central players into wide areas. Here it was Besic tasked with helping out Garbutt for long periods, the Bosnian constantly having to shuffle across to cover the two-on-one situations engineered by those in red.

Nobody wants to see Lukaku feeding on aimless passes into the channels, and then be expected to seize on his one and only clear chance in a match of endless toil. There is nothing to gain from inhibiting Barkley's natural game by asking him to operate in an inside-forward role.

Everton possess width, pace and invention at their best. None of those traits surfaced here, nor have they materialised over the course of this season. The players are there, though; the quality is there. It is on Martinez to employ tactics suited to them or risk seeing his stubborn dedication to various shapeless systems drag this season further into the mire.***",null,0,null,1425825466,null,0,false,0,cp85awg,null,t3_2yaxre,null,t1_cp85awg,null,t1_cp853x1,null,null,null,1427643944,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

The single biggest contributer to the wealth you enjoy in life is how much wealth you start with. There are some exceptions but that's hopefully not contentious. The poor stay poor, the rich stay rich. 

There are some statistics about how many news anchors and journalists are privately educated that I'll try and find. It's most of them. Same with politicians. That might not sound like an issue but have look at the rhetoric they're spreading. How many stories have we all read about benefit scroungers?

Obviously there is some limit to that; but it's quite hard to get data on this kind of thing. There are a few other studies looking at recidivism rates based on sentence - mainly from the US where you can have variations in sentences between states. Generally they indicate that sentence length has a minimal effect - if any - on recidivism rate, in some cases a longer sentence correlated with a higher chance of re-offending.

I bought their happy light matte primer in early October and only ran out a week or two ago with daily use.   

Rimmel is also a good brand to look in to as well.  I know a lot of people who love the Rimmel match perfect foundation, but can't say anything from personal use.

null,false,Bearmodulate,null,null,null,"&gt; Strict full suit-and-tie dress code

- My uniform was trousers, black shoes, black socks, sky blue button down shirt, navy blue blazer with school logo emblazoned onto the front pocket, and a blue and yellow diagonally striped tie (school colours). You were given detention if you wore it wrongly (shirt untucked, tie too short etc) a few times.

&gt;Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

- Not *really*. We had that for sports days and such but it didn't play much of a role outside of that. We had form which is basically a class of about 30 people who get together every lunch time with a form tutor to make sure everyone was okay with school and all that shit, we competed with other forms on attendance and such. Grand prize at the end of the year was a trip to Alton Towers.
As for taking classes we mostly just get put into classes based on our skill level, so if you're good at maths you'll be put into set 1 (and this will go down to set 9 for the worst) so you're put in classes of people with similar skills to you. It's almost entirely year-wide but we did have some classes with our form groups.

&gt;There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

- Nope, we just hung around outside or sat in the library. 

&gt;There is a captain/prefect for each house

- We had prefects, their job was mostly to stand at the doors to the school blocks at break times and make sure people weren't dicking around inside. That, and to pass any concerns anyone had on to the year leader etc (they had weekly meetings where all the prefects + year leader tutors got together)

&gt;Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)

- Nope, that was just year-wide. 

&gt;There are many inter-house competitions.

- Outside of sports day, the houses didn't really matter. We had a lot of competitions between forms though.

&gt;There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

- Not for the whole school, but there's one for your year group. They'd be picked from the prefects.

&gt;""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")

- This is something that used to exist, but not anymore. It was around when J.K. Rowling went to school.

&gt;Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin

- Again, you'll only find this in the posh public schools where you have to pay £30k/annum to get in.

&gt;Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.

- Only in posh public schools again, most other schools aren't so old. Mine was built in the 70s.

&gt;Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")

- No, teachers use our first names. We use their last as well as using ""sir"" and ""miss"" when we want their attention.

&gt;In-depth study of European and British history from the Byzantine Empire up to about 1945 or so

- We generally will learn a lot of ancient history, a lot of British history, and a lot of European history up until year 9 (where you get to choose what classes you want to take forward into your GCSEs), I chose history and so I did a *lot* on the tudors + period just prior, as well as World War 1, women's suffrage, post-war Germany and Hitler's rise to power and WW2

This is how it was when I left secondary school 5 years ago.

I'm assuming you're talking about the free schools anyway, not the paid public ones. Hogwarts would absolutely be a public school if it were real.

Oscar is very much the way to go and he is one of those players who plays better and better the more game time he gets.

A bit further afield, but still well known enough to have things for tourists to do, is the village of Grantchester.

If you like a drink, then in the city centre pub of choice is [The Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eagle_%28pub%29), famous both because it's where DNA was 'discovered', and because of its RAF bar where the ceiling is filled with signatures and doodles of airmen from WW2.

To compare him to Adebayor, he presents himself as much more supportive and ingrained within the team.

obviously the weekend is Game stuff

Malingering Monday: any thing from the past weekend that you want to rehash since the post-match thread is gone. this could also involve other teams/discussions. basically any thoughts  malingering around your head

transfer tuesday: speculative talk on what the team needs, who you would like to see go in and out, potential youngsters coming through the ranks, etc.

whimiscal wednesday:  a free talk thread for whatever the hell you want to say (I think its better placed midweek since the end of the week may be more dominated by game talk). this is where you post stuff about other inferior north london clubs

Throwback spursday (thursday. shoutout to /u/HipsterRyanMason): all your posts/thoughts/gifs about beloved former spurs

Fresh-topic friday:Let's get a discussion going before the weekend starts! things to ponder while watching the matches! player/manager related questions regarding their forms, talents, ideas, and other such stuff. like ""why does Lamela give the ball away in the final third (shoutout to /u/anstonfire for the example)

then obviously the weekend is devoted to the game.

again, not an original idea but it could certainly help foster a more centralized discussion and keep lazy posts off of the main page.

To actually finish from there with such a beautifully placed strike, almost 90 minutes in after sprinting another 50 yards or so takes *supreme* fitness. The team's on another level compared to most in the league.

 Larsson's free kick that game was also quite special, not much Hugo could do there so that goal's not much of a problem although the challenge (on Defoe?) was badly timed and out of frustration iirc. Some like [this](https://gfycat.com/MajesticPaleBlackfootedferret) are due to lack of concentration (Bentaleb should stick to Sig there) or other defensive lapses (mistimed challenges, not strong enough in them etc) but sometimes they just play well and score, yes nothing's perfect but sometimes you just need to recognise they played well.

Then we also miss chances - Kane's volley yesterday for example, if he tried to place it instead of blasting it he would've scored. Then they just do well too, Green made a couple good saves yesterday.

In recent years it has become bloody awful though. The police and private security have acted like arseholes and so have loads of the people attending, who see it as just another festival. The druids, whether you agree with any right or reasons they have to be there or not, can't actually do their thing anywhere near the stones any more.

As long as I can remember graffiti has been an issue there, though. I can remember driving past it on the way to Cornwall, when anyone could just park up and wander round, when it had CND signs and 'Ban the Bomb' as well as 'Southampton FC' painted all over it.

&gt;The __fencing response__ is a peculiar position of the arms following a [concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion). Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football), [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey), [rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football) and [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts). It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.

null,false,swug3,,UKIP,null,"*sigh*. Here's a story on why Russia is what its like today. 

300 years ago, Peter the Great ruled Russia, he modernised Russia, but at the (perceived) expense of the old Slav ways. Peter the Great created Europhiles and Slavophiles in Russia during his reign. These two ideologies have been the bane of not only the Tsars, but also the Communist leaders. Putin is a Slavophile. He fears western ideals from overtaking Slavic ones. 



Ukraine's importance isn't about where it lies between Russia and EU. Ukraine's importance comes from the Kiev Rus. The birth of the Russian nation comes from the Rus. Losing Ukraine is earth shattering to the Russians.

Back to Putin being a Slavophile. When you have a Slavophile leader, you will see expansion, not out of aggression, but out of fear. Putin fears European influence, he doesn't want a strong EU, he wants it to be weak, so they cannot challenge his Slavic way of thinking.

So people saying ""Oh its Russia's fault"" or ""NATO are continuing a policy they had in the Cold War"" do not understand anything about the situation at hand. There isn't a New Cold War (Yet). Its an Economic War. Russia needs the West to buy its Oil, and the West needs Russia's oil. At some point, someone will back down. 

NATO isn't building an Empire.

 The author of this piece is saying the same view that revisionist historians had in the 1970's saying that ""America is building an Empire"". Its factually incorrect and quite frankly, an ignorant view to have.

Nothing will ever change between Russia and Europe, its just what has happened and will happen in the future.

(Note, I am not defending Putin or NATO, I am just trying to give historical background on why it is happening. What is happening in Ukraine is tragic.)

null,false,zelwell,present,,null,"Well to say hes been poor recently is a bit unfair. Looking back over the past month he has:

* Aston Villa- An average performance in a poor team performance and scrappy win. Keep in mind Drogba started this match and put in an absolutely terrible performance. 

* Everton- not even on the bench. (I think he was ill?)

* PSG-off the bench with 10 minutes to go.  

* Burnley- outcome aside, an okay performance against a very defensive team. Then is subbed off after Matic's red card.

* Cup Final- subbed in the 88' minute. 

* West Ham- Another okay performance as part of a makeshift midfield that saw him receive little possession and play a lot of defense in the second half. 

In 6 games since the beginning of February he has missed an entire game, been subbed on in the last 10 minutes twice (PSG and Spurs), and average performances in what were probably the three worst team performances of the season so far ( Aston Villa, Burnley and West Ham.)   

So to say that he has been been ""fading"" and ""not offered much going forward"" in just three of our worst team performance of the season is unfair to him and to suggest we buy someone in the summer to replace him is just wrong.

Few minutes into the game and Gestede and Škrtel go up for a header, Škrtel hits peak height to win the header and as he remains at peak height Gestede's elbow/back of the arm is flailed towards Škrtel's neck. 

This isn't the initial problem, it doesn't look malicious and there wasn't much in it however because Škrtel was at peak height mid air, the elbow knocks him back and he falls back down to the ground on his back - he doesn't land on his feet, he slams on his back like something out of wrestling.

He's down for 7-8 minutes as the paramedics and Liverpool medical staff check him over, put a neck brace on and take him off on a stretcher. Some Rovers fans were singing a song for Gestede whilst Škrtel was down however when he was stretchered off he had a warm round of applause.

Kolo warmed up during that time and comes on.

We all know he's a strong fucker but I think to be honest before we start getting scared - he might just have been in shock and in pain, it might well not be something too serious.

&gt; A: Alright well here's what you do. What's your experience level? As you do this ritual, burn a black candle. Make a poppet (you know how those work, right?) and stuff it with herbs for peace. I suggest reading Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Herbs. You may even add an appropriate crystal to go with it. Then when the poppet it all sown up, bind it. Tie it with red and black ribbon around the arms and legs. Red for strength, black for binding. Wish for your relative to have a good life somewhere far away from you. Sew the poppet's mouth shut with black thread. When the deed is done, put the candle and poppet in a box and stash them in some forgotten dark corner out of sight.

Also comes with an elasticated rain cover with clear section and carry handle which I will never use.

Just because I know that underage sex happens a lot and therefore is should be accepted as a ""Well, it happens"" it doesn't mean I condone it.   

People are deluded if they think 14-year-olds or whatever don't sexually experiment etc. Just look at some threads on Mumsnet.

I agree with the disclaimer, and I think that's the angle that should be taken in Sex Ed.   

I can't help but feel that too many adults are in denial when it comes to this topic. I doubt any parent would like to imagine that their child is sexually active, but they really ought to at least try and objectively remove themselves from that and accept that sex and sexual activity does happen within the pre-16 members of society.

Cake can mean what you understand cake to mean, a dessert made with eggs, flour, butter, sugar, etc.  Sponge conjures up images of a certain texture of cake.  Sticky toffee pudding is first and foremost a pudding (because it's steamed, not baked), but could also be considered cake and sponge based on the ingredients and texture.

I think cake can also be used as a catch-all term for sweet things that can be eaten outside of after-dinner dessert, e.g. during a tea break, so it makes sense to me that brownies, flapjacks and cornflake cakes could all be cakes.  

A fruit crumble is a pudding because you normally have it as a pudding, with custard, but is not cake because it not made like a sponge cake, nor is it served for tea.  British husband disagrees apple pies are cakes.  Like much British terminology, it could also be a regional thing.

Although a trifle has some cake-like elements (contains sponge, and is attractively layered and decorated), my instinct is that it's not a cake. Maybe because it can't be sliced like a cake, and instead be scooped into a bowl?  Maybe because the other ingredients overshadow the sponge?  Also because you wouldn't eat it during tea time.
