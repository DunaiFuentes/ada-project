null,false,the_magisteriate,tardis,TARDIS,null,"Most of the overarching ""story"" from the end of series 4 onwards actually finished at the end of Series 7 or was reasonably self contained.

The Tenth Doctor regenerated, trapping the Master on Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. The new Doctor then meets Amy and encounters cracks in time which destroys the universe, which he then reboots, using a restoration field and help from River Song. He then flies off with Amy and her newlywed husband Rory to have a honeymoon. After the honeymoon, Amy and Rory wait at home for the Doctor to reappear and get a mysterious message telling them to go to America. They meet with River Song, watch the Doctor get killed by an astronaut in a lake, and then meet the Doctor 300 years younger than the one that just died. They go to Washington DC in 1969, find a young girl in a spacesuit (who escapes and is later seen regenerating) and overthrow an alien group called the Silence, memory-proof aliens who run the world with post-hypnotic suggestion. Stuff happens, and it turns out that the Amy in the TARDIS was a duplicate, the real one is pregnant, her baby gets stolen by the Silence and will become River Song. More stuff happens, the Doctor's timeline catches up with the start of the series where he dies, but it was actually a robot replica that got shot, and everyone thinks that the Doctor is dead except River, Amy and Rory. More stuff happens, Amy, Rory and the Doctor get trapped by Weeping Angels in New York and Amy and Rory get stuck in the past because of a paradox which the Doctor cannot risk breaking. He goes into seclusion, hiding until the Great Intelligence emerges, and meets a girl called Clara who dies and who is identical to a girl called Oswin from the future who died (both use the same phrase  ""Run you clever boy, and remember""). The Doctor again goes into seclusion to think about this ""impossible girl"" and gets a strange phone call from a Clara in the present day. She uses ""Run you clever boy and remember"" as a mnemonic for a password, rycbar123, revealing her to be the same girl. They defeat the Great Intelligence again, stuff happens, the Doctor obsesses over the ""impossible girl"", and at the end of the series she splits herself into the Doctor's timeline (to defeat the Great Intelligence, who had done the same but to destroy the Doctor's timeline) splitting herself across time. This is done at Trenzalore, which is where the Doctor's grave and final resting place is.

This is where the important stuff you need to know at the minute starts. The Doctor meets up with his past selves to save Gallifrey in a parallel pocket universe (if you do watch any episode you've missed, go and watch Day of the Doctor, it's the 50th anniversary special and is fantastic). He then goes to Trenzalore, which has a crack in time on it (from all the way back from Series 5) which is sending out the Gallifreyan coded message ""Doctor Who"", indicating that Gallifrey is inside and wants the Doctor to let them out. If he does, all hell will break loose so instead he protects the planet for several centuries, dying of old age. The Time Lords change history, giving him a new set of regenerations and allowing him to change history and avoid his death on Trenzalore. However, Gallifrey leaves and he does not know where it went. The Doctor Regenerates and it is revealed that the Master gave Clara the Doctor's phone number to engineer a plan to give the Doctor an army of Cybermen just to see what he'd do (by getting the Doctor to find Clara's dead boyfriend in the afterlife). The Doctor then sees the Master get killed by a Cyberman who he believes to be the Brigadier. Clara and the Doctor lie to each other and are then reunited and travel together.",null,0,null,1433779183,null,0,false,0,crzjals,null,t3_38yuc1,null,t1_crzjals,null,t3_38yuc1,null,null,null,1436823369,null,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

Section 5. [**Immigration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy#Immigration) of article  [**Lump of labour fallacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump%20of%20labour%20fallacy): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The lump of labour fallacy has been applied to concerns around immigration and labour. Given a fixed availability of employment, the lump of labour position argues that allowing immigration of working age people reduces the availability of work for native born workers (""they are taking our jobs""). This may be refuted by arguing that (1) skilled immigrating workers may bring capabilities that are not available in the native workforce (e.g. banking, academic research), and (2) that immigrating workforces also create additional jobs, thus expanding the economy and creating further jobs directly (e.g. setting up businesses and requiring local services or workforces) or indirectly (e.g. an increased population needs to buy more groceries, therefore increasing demand on shops, therefore requiring additional shop staff).

Other top teams weren't smashing down the door for Lambert either btw and he did improve later in his career but never to the level that would interest a serious top 4 challenging side. Lallana is another player that we vastly overpaid for and is a very decent player that came up through the leagues with Southampton. I might give you that one, but he's one of the exceptions. In MOST cases, players, especially attacking ones, hit their ceiling at around 24. Ings has one year of a key development time in his career and he's going to spend it on our bench. The other players you mention were all miles ahead of Ings at the same point in their career.

Lucas was one of the best players of his generation in Brazil when we signed him. From wikipedia: He was the youngest player ever to receive Placar magazine's Bola de Ouro (Golden Ball), given to the best player in the Campeonato Brasileiro – an honour previously won by the likes of Zico, Falcão, Careca, Alex, Romário, Robinho, Kaká and Tévez.

Alonso was wanted by Real Madrid but they didn't meet his release clause, before we signed him. He was very highly rated in la liga. 

Gerrard and Carragher came through our academy and broke into a top 4 team in their teens. No comparison there. 

Suarez's record when he was 22 - 49 goal for Ajax. How can you even compare that! He had 28 caps for Uruguay and 9 international goals at 22! Mascherano had 8 caps for Argentina at 22! 

Danny Ings has 9 U21 caps for England.

Edit: Forgot you mentioned Henderson. He was Sunderland young player of the year 2 years in a row for a team in the premiership and was making the England squad at the age of 20.

This one was done to death in the run-up to the Independence Referendum when people were concerned/hopeful that an independent Scotland would mean rUK was forever run by the Tories. 

Without the Scottish MPs, Labour would still have formed a government in every one of their post-WW2 election wins except 1964 (which only lasted until 1966 anyway).

Other than the swing towards the SNP, which obviously effects Scotland, the ""left vote"" isn't terribly fragmented by historical standards. The Greens are doing OK at the moment, but nothing unusual for minor parties.

It's hardly unprecedented for a government to win a second term, and the major party of a coalition winning seems similar. Nothing really unusual to see here, it's just party politics as normal. Eventually enough people will decide it's time for a change and the other side will get a go for a while. It might be 2020 or it might be 2025, but I don't think this is any more of a one-party state than the Tories from 1979-1997 or Labour being in power for 13 years after that.

'“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.  A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’""

Additionally, compare this passage with Matthew 25:31-46. 

For the section you quoted: what Jesus means here is that He must be the one that you love above all else, not that you literally hate your family and others.

So Edinburgh has a ton of stuff going on. I'm from a bit further north in Scotland and lived here a few years now (time has FLOWN IN) and still finding fun stuff to do daily. 

Edinburgh is like a city centre with a big castle, surrounded by lots of little villages which make up the massive city that it is. (Well to me its big haha)

I read you like castles, so first point of call could be to do a wee day checking out castle's. 

You obviously have THE castle in the heart of the city, which is quite big, bit of a tourist trap, but excellent to see for a good view round the city, the panoramic views are stunning. But then you have castle's such as Craigmillar castle (which is near a bad area sadly but decent to see and it's more like ruins, again great views of the Firth of Forth and Arthur's Seat), and a bit further out you have  Melville castle which is nice enough, and Lauriston castle. Dalhousie Castle is nice too, they have falconry and nice food but a bit out the city limits. 

Arthurs Seat and  a wander round Duddingston are worth doing, there's a really old pub called the Sheep's Heid in Duddingston which is nice for a wee pint, plus I'm convinced its haunted. 

There's lots of quirky pubs and eateries to check out, but I'd need to know what foods you wanted to try etc, what type of bars you liked etc. I enjoy eating in Edinburgh :)

I like going down Stockbridge, it's lovely for a walk about and food/drinks. 

You have a good base in Edinburgh, it's not far a bus ride from St Andrew's which is definitely worth checking out, again some old ruins and a nice coastal town. I would say do St Andrews and Anstruther in the same day (get a nice fish and chips in Anstruther and it is a beautiful little fishing town). 
You can also easily check out Glasgow for the day, there are again a TON of old buildings and stuff to get up to in that city.

Every household in the UK needs to pay council tax (there is a DISCOUNT if there is only one adult in the house of 25%) whether or not anyone in the house is working.

There is no such thing as council tax support, you are thinking of what is now called council tax REDUCTION (different to above) where your council tax may be reduced based on a means test. You apply for this on the same form as housing benefit to your local district council.
https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/help-with-your-council-tax-council-tax-reduction/council-tax-reduction-making-an-application/

This is what I'm guessing has happened;
Your mother has applied for housing benefit for your household and been given a council tax reduction, probably so she is not paying at all.

Now you are working, your household has moved up, and the amount of reduction you were getting has decreased, this may affect your housing benefit as well.

You and your mother are now jointly liable for the council tax.

There are other benefits you might get to help, you said your mum was on the sick, which I'm assuming is ESA, she may be eligible to apply for PIP. Also double check she is claiming CB and CTC for your brothers if they are still under age. Now you are working think about claiming WTC if you are over 16 hours a week, and go back on JSA if your under 16 (you can claim JSA while you have a job). If your mum is on PIP or DLA you may be eligible for carer's while you are living with her still.

If you're unfamiliar with benefits, the citizens advice website is great.

You can go into a citizen's advice bureau and ask for a benefit check, remember they are free and independent, and they will work out exactly how much you are entitled to across all benefits. Take your and your mothers financial details with you, and your mother if she can get there.",null,0,null,1433782444,null,0,false,0,crzl9ub,null,t3_38zuqg,null,t1_crzl9ub,null,t3_38zuqg,null,null,null,1436824434,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

As far as Milner goes... Lucas is only better than him defensively.  Milner does everything else better.  BR has shown clear as day for 3 seasons now that he's not the biggest fan of a dedicated defensive midfielder, he likes his midfield players to be much more dynamic than Lucas is (which I would bet a is part of why BR keeps Lucas out of the lineup for long stretches of the season before reverting back to him when he's got no other choice).

There'll be similarities, but anyone who has watched both can see that Sky is a whole lot better than Fox (and other news channels are better than Sky)

Again, try watching both. One key problem with the idea that Sky and Fox are identical is that Sky is subject to fairly stringent Ofcom regulations, whereas Fox isn't

In the past 15 years we've gotten very used to an incumbent government being opposed primarily by the actual opposition... but historically this has not always been the case (counter-intuitive though it may seem). 

For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s the conservatives main opposition was their own backbenchers - and essentially that is the situation again now. The Labour party is defeated and going through a prolonged period of introspection. What emerges from that remains to be seen, and I suspect it will be broadly two things; a blairite (in everything but name) school whose raison d'etre is to re-capture middle England to win in 2020, and a leftist-unionist wing whose goal is to go back in time to 1947. On a similar note, the lib dems are virtually annihilated and the SNP are not yet sure what to actually do with their 56 seats (except to extoll the value of their 56 seats and how important they are and how they'll be able to contribute or change something, at some point, maybe, possible, perhaps).

So really, that leaves the conservative party as its own voice of opposition - and you'll see names of backbenchers like Peter Bone, Steve Baker, Jacob Rees Mogg etc. more often over the next 5 years. 

Is this a bad thing? - Hard to say. In the 1990s backbencher rebellions in the conservative party effectively destroyed John Majors government and prevented him passing much meaningful legislation.

There are moreover plenty of working class and trade union Tories in the South West and West Midlands and some of the safest Tory seats of all are in the North of England.

Labour has quite narrowly been predominantly the party of areas with local economies based on trade union dominated industries: mining, manufacturing, docking, etc. The decline of these has put Labour in a death spiral. Blair briefly revived Labour with a coalition of supporters (particularly BMEs, anti-Tory middle class supporters, etc) though that has started to fall apart.

Second - get a lawyer involved. It really should not cost £3000! Where did that idea come from?

This is the biggest purchase you will ever make - don't risk cocking it up (and with respect, there is a good chance you would) to save a tiny fraction of the risk. The law is very odd and complex in this area, so the scope for mistake is large - however, a lawyer should be used to dealing with this and be able to sort it out without much effort, provide you and your partner are on the same page (sounds like you are) so your lawyers don't have to negotiate at length.

This is a good website to look at for the main tourist attractions in Belfast. They are all pretty easy to get to from a taxi or a bus. If you find time I really recommend getting up to the North Coast and seeing the Giants Causeway and Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge.

99% of Belfast is fine if you're worried about the whole 'Troubles' issue. Main rule of thumb like any city that you're not familiar with is just use your common sense, if the area looks dodgy just move on. Don't go wondering off somewhere unfamiliar at night! If you stick to the main part of the city you will be completely fine. If you're focusing on the Troubles I do recommend taking a 'Black Taxi Ride' or one of the 'Red Tour Bus's' around the Peace wall and both prod/catholic communities. These are tours that explain all about the troubles, history and culture of both sides. I took a black cab one last year with a friend who was visiting, really learnt so much about a city that i've lived in for 25 years.

Over stacking our midfield with creative players wont guarantee that we become a creative team. There must be a balance and space for everyone to operate in. Our midfield was a clusterfuck all season long. From weak performances year round in the CDM role and lack of that fluidness you're talking about on the attacking end. Sure, we were missing a striker to get in behind, but Rodgers was very stubborn in not adjusting to what he had at his disposal. That is on him 100%. Sturridge is not 100% and may not be all of next season. And Ings/Origi are not similar to Sturridge regarding his runs and both are young/unproven at a top club which has much more pressures than where they were. Therefore IMO we need to scrap this failed 1 striker attempt bc it simply has not worked for us at all since Rodgers came on board. A lot of the games we won last year were a result of an instant of individual brilliance from one or two of our players.

null,false,ThatFuckingElric,,Year 11,null,"Whatever revision guides or papers your teachers will give you, at least use them. They are written by your own teachers - they have a lot of knowledge in their chosen subject. I have a crapload of History revision guides which help me a lot. I used the revision papers all of my Science teachers had made - which were very useful. 

Also, as pretty much everyone would say, start revising early - about 2-3 months before your first exam. I didn't revise much except for my mock exams, and I always revise last minute. It's  inevitable for me. If you start revising early, you'll be able to hold all the information better over a long time.

Strangely enough, even though I revised last minute, it actually helped me - I knew all the stuff.

Teachers always try to make exams look scary as hell by making your mocks just one week long, about 3-4 every day, and by putting emphasis on exams in almost every lesson. Exams aren't like that, they're spread out across 1 1/2 months to allow you some time to revise and have a break.

A few months before your exams begin, if your school starts offering any revision sessions on Saturday or any other day (maybe even on school days), GO TO THEM! They don't care if you have to spend your Saturday morning revising History or Science, they want you to do well in your exams, they want you to feel proud knowing you did your best in the exam, they want you to have a good future.

Around a week or two before the exams arrive, don't bother doing homework if your teachers give you any. If it is to do a past paper, it's understandable as that will allow you to test yourself properly. If it is anything else, like ""write this 6 marker question bla bla bla"" for RE, don't even bother - time is of the essence, and it can be better spent revising for your exams.

So you were lying when you said this? They build their team around their best players - Modric, Rakitic and Mandzukic - and usually select either Brozovic or Kovacic depending on the opposition.

If Raheem Sterling plays in England's remaining qualifiers he will have 20 caps, 1 goal *before* he's 21 and England have a lot of wingers. This is just an example, I'm guessing there's loads more 21 year olds with 20 caps, 1 goal.

EDIT: Since Brozovic joined Inter he's started 13 league games; Kovacic only 10 I think. He can't even get in the Inter team regularly, never mind have the Croatia team built around him.

Very bad and dangerous way of thinking when designing anything. This is the whole 'the Titanic is unsinkable' train of thought. If you have two trains going round a closed loop you have to assume at some point they will hit each other and design it accordingly. All it would take is one buffer sticking out each end of these trains and the passengers would have only had bad whiplash and bruises vs missing legs and smashed pelvises. Here is an example train i found with a buffer (in orange) [pic](http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/news/features/iaapa_2001/tr_gallery/img/iaapa_interpark.jpg) one of those on each end of the train and you would avoid the crush injuries. Even better here is a Gerstlauer train that has a buffer [pic](http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/news/features/iaapa_2001/tr_gallery/img/iaapa_gerstlauer.jpg) so they clearly have them around but just decided not to bother.

Not only will she claim for psychiatric damage (being trapped on the ride for so long will likely lead to a certain level of PTSD) but Merlin Entertainments will want to settle this case at a high value to keep it out of court and therefore out of the media. Any decent PI lawyer acting on behalf of the victims will be aware of that.

The judicial guidelines for Above Knee Amputation award was set at about £170,000 – £245,000. I don't have the exact figures at hand but if you're interested they are contained within the *Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases*. Remember those figures are for the injury alone. There are other heads of claim that will pay out just as much. These include: loss of earnings, loss of future employment, cost of health and rehabilition sessions. There are many other heads of claim that will apply too. A pay out for these injuries and in these circumstances could easily reach £500k+.

Well, not literally. But if I did lose a limb, I'd love one of these new mechanical ones. It's amazing what they can do now. They still aren't as good as a real limb, but I could imagine that they'll be getting close relatively soon.

But you probably need a certain kind of mindset to be happy about having a replacement arm like this, instead of a biological one. I've recently read about how someone 'grew an arm' (sort of). Using a rat limb, they removed all the old cells, leaving the membrane scaffold to support the new cells. It's thought that this may lead to using donor limbs to 'regrow' using the recipient's cells so there's no rejection.

Go to Laverys and try buckfast, or even just get a bottle of buckfast for yourself from an off-license.  Get an Ulster Fry at some point.

They completely underestimated how much of their vote was just anti-Tory disaffected lefties who won't vote Labour because of Iraq or because they live in a Tory seat where people won't vote red. They're a party in search of a movement - since the war they've struggled to be more than a protest party, whether as the new home for the Labour right or the anti-war home. They've got a niche now as the civil libertarian/maybe soft on drugs party but the kind of demographic that digs that (young people) will eternally distrust them over their U-turn on tuition fees.

&gt; I know a party which emphasised rights for all people, progressive social and economic policy and above all pragmatism would be popular with the left and centre, a sort of electable Lib Dems. 

That is pretty much what New Labour was, but it collapsed because the left did one over Iraq and they weren't capable of delivering substantial change to the British people. I mean, they were in power for 13 years and what did we get? The minimum wage? What else, really? It was a semi-rosy period that a lot of British people kind of remember fondly, but not much actually changed. 

There is a massive amount of hard thinking to do in Labour because the party is dying. The trades unions are withering, the party is much, much, much too centralised (and that is killing them in Scotland) and there's no democracy or vitality. Being a member of the Labour Party feels genuinely uncool. They're bleeding people on the right to UKIP and on the left to the Greens and SNP. I think it's just a matter of time before Plaid start picking off seats and then what? Labour probably can't do more than expect to be heads of an anti-Tory coalition in office but it goes further than just recognising you're not the only lefties in town anymore.

He is someone who fascinates me and For those who don't know him he is the Southampton chairman who found Pochettino, revolutionised how they did business, and led them from league one to the premier league. 

He was absolutely ruthless in terms of making everything everyone at the club did line up with one goal. Make life more comfortable for the players with the goal of making them perform better. 

Here's an article from the mail a few years back detailing some of the things he did. How he had different types of training pitch installed to match the various surfaces different premier league teams use at their grounds so they could prepare for games on the appropriate type of pitch. How he knew the birthday of every player (and their wives) and made sure they all got a card on the birthday.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2515877/Southampton-masterplan-win-Premier-League.html

He was also the guy who brought in a policy of making an individually tailored mattress for each player for away games and sent a team on the road the day before players arrived for an away game to make sure each of their hotel rooms was cleaned &amp; prepared exactly how they liked it when they arrived. Chefs individually prepared their favoured meals. Everything was thought of that might make a difference on match day.

There has to be a limit at which you say that the residual risk is acceptable. To do that you evaluate every possible scenario, and its severity, and from those two parameters you calculate a risk score. From there you deal with the  risks one by one, until you have reached an acceptable level. Those risk with a higher score (i.e. more frequent or more serious risks) get more money, because that represents the best value for money.

If you already have a system which prevents cart collisions on track, and anyhow, you only let one cart around at a time, then the risk may be acceptably low, and what possible modifications could you make to lower it further?

While we don't know what happened here, it seems probable that there was a very unusual set of circumstances which together resulted in a scenario which had not been considered either by the manufacturer or Alton towers, and that now that this extraordinary scenario has been recognised it can be mitigated on this and other rides.

I left sixth form at 18 and went to Australia literally a week after leaving. Worked on a cattle station for 9 months before returning home. There was a lad from Manchester who paid a company £2500 to work there - guess how much I paid? Just under £900 for my flights and a visa.

I lived in the workers house on the ranch. Agencies would charge foreigners $300 - $500 a month to live there depending on the room, I was getting charged $200 and had my own room with a toilet and catering facilities. Agencies would pack 4 people into a small room and have up to 10 people sharing a single bathroom.

On average I worked 5 days a week, sometimes I would work 7 days a week depending on the work and I earned $420. Depending on what agency, placements would earn $250 - $300 for the same amount of work I did.

I saved up for 6 months and soon had enough money to travel around Australia and at the end of my trip I had enough saved to go somewhere else the following year (Salt Lake City in the States). Agency placements would have to work for something like 10 or 11 months just to have enough to travel.

Obviously not all agencies are the same but the people I met regretted going with an agency because you can cut out the middleman and do it yourself for much cheaper.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, I've been on two work holidays now and have gone by myself without the assistance of any company.

I do hate Blair, you're right, whilst he did some good, he also made Labour unelectable(again). Smith had the unions backing and lets not forget Black Wednesday and the sleaze of the Tory party at the time which Blair promised to get rid of.

I hate Blair because he went back on the few Labour values he promised. He didn't renationalise the railways, that policy now belongs to only the far left, he didn't end NHS internal markets to stop hospitals competing with each other, he accelerated them. 

He ran with the line 'Education, Education, Education' and brought in tuition fees. He began the privitisation which has given the Tories the all clear to privatise everything that isn't nailed down. 

Blair may have won three elections, but he did more harm than good. Especially to the Labour party, he loved mingling with corporate types, replaced sleaze with war crimes and then brought sleaze back.

This notion that New Labour is the only way to win is what keeps Labour stuck in the past. I'm not calling for a return to 1970s socialism. I'm just asking for a modern democratic socialist party, not the Tory-lite party that Labour is morphing back into. 

Next election if it's between a Blairite and Boris then my advice is that of Kinnock's 'I warn you not to be ordinary, I warn you not to be young, I warn you not to fall ill and I warn you not to grow old.'

Example: BR has done the same thing for the last 3 seasons. He starts the season with Lucas on the bench bc he believe Lucas can’t play CDM by himself. This yr he started with Lucas/Gerrard but then benched Lucas bc after one game everyone panicked and said Lucas with Gerrard would never work. Instead of changing Gerrards role, he benched Lucas.

Then 2nd half of the season he changes Gerrards role and he becomes much more valuable. Guarantee you he’s gonna do the same thing to Lucas this year. 

Regarding you comment, why must you only play one of those 5? We do need defensive cover in the midfield, be it through a new signing (my opinion what we need most) or trying some sort of combination involving Milner/Hendo/Can/Lucas. Only thing I know for sure is that all 5 of those can not start, that would be a defensive disaster. (not saying you said all 5 should btw)

But IMO I feel that you are trying to do the same thing we did last year, play players who did not show they were consistent or dangerous last season in the same system that didn't work and expect better results. You realize that Sturridge is still injured right? Who would be our sole striker that would lead us to glory with the players you mentioned? Even when we were rocking with SAS it was because Suarez was not a winger even though we were playing 4-3-3. He was a second striker most of the time and that's why it worked. We did not do that last year. BR constantly tried to play Sterling up top and it failed every single time. I like BR but his stubborn ways has really pissed me off this past season. 

Regarding my initial comment, Rodgers signed 2 attacking midfielders in Lallana and Coutinho. He then signs Markovic to play on the wing, and Sterling/Ibe promoted from within. Plus Hendo/Lucas/Can/Milner etc.. in the middle… Any sane man would realize that out of those 8-9 players that only 2, max 3 would probably consistently start. 

Bottom line, we will get absolutely no where if we are reliant on our current system next year. Our players are young and inexperienced. I still believe that Lazar, Can, Ibe and all of our young players have the chance to come good, but to go out there next year and expect them to finish top 4 and challenge for a cup in the same exact system that failed us miserably this year is a bit ridiculous. 

We need goals and lots of it to remain competitive. We need 2 strikers.  ",null,0,null,1433792402,null,0,false,0,crzrkt6,null,t3_3924pk,null,t1_crzrkt6,null,t1_crzqazz,null,null,null,1436828916,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

TV's changed a lot since the days of the classic series. These days, Who (like a lot of genre television) has individual episodes be fairly self-contained stories that develop and advance season-long arcs. Classic Who is formatted into serials--a story is usually 4 episodes long, and the familiar landmarks of a TV season (season premieres, season finales, etc.) just don't exist.

There's also not infrequently mismatches between the amount of story being told and the amount of time allotted to it, and sometimes this makes for strange viewing. You, as the viewer, are used to modern TV, which is so tightly plotted that it has nearly no loose bits, because the showrunners can't afford any when they have 42 minutes to tell a story. Classic Who... does not do that. It can have practically nothing happen in an episode. It can wander into a side plot that doesn't really bear on the main plot. Or, at the other extreme, you can have a story pared down well past comprehension. (""Ghost Light"" is well-thought-of among fans but is famously opaque.)

Not according to teh voters. The Blair era was the best time of their lives - they got what they had been after for decades - capitalism with a safety net. They got the NHS sorted, they got education improved, they got to make some money.

You talk about tuition fees - so I'll direct your gaze to Scotland. The SNP have abolished tuition fees and in England it's £9000 per annum - and yet there are more poor people in England going to university than in Scotland!!! How can that be? Easy - the SNP raided the schools budget to pay for the tuition fees. So those poor Scots? They don't even get the grades to qualify for university, because Scottish schools have been trashed. It's not money that prevents people from going to university, **it's grades**, it's always been grades and Blair introduced fees to be able to divert money into the schools budget to improve people's grades so they had a shot and weren't ruled out before they even reached 18.

The SNP have done the opposite - they've tried to recreate the 1960's when the vast majority got crappy secondary modern education doing woodwork when machines had already made that stuff obsolete, while the money went to their ""betters"" to pay their university fees. But at least in the '60s there were plenty of jobs for the unskilled. Today they only thing someone unskilled can do is cleaning toilets, everything else is done by robots.

null,false,ieya404,null,null,null,"&gt; It's hardly unprecedented for a government to win a second term, and the major party of a coalition winning seems similar. Nothing really unusual to see here, it's just party politics as normal.

It's actually *incredibly* unusual for a governing party's vote share to go up from one election to the next.  

Labour's vote share of 43.2% in 1997 fell to 40.7% in 2001, then 35.2% in 2005, and then 29.0% in 2010.  

The Tories won 43.9% in 1979, then 42.4% in 1983, 42.2% in 1987, 41.9% in 1992, 30.7% in 1997.

In both cases, the vote share of the governing party drops every single election until they eventually lose power.

It would be an utter travesty to take money from other needier parts of the budget (or put up taxes on poor people) in order to nationlise the railways and provide socialism for middle-managers!

Wakey Wakey! The era when the poor travelled to work by rail has long gone because a) work has changed and b) most people prefer to travel by car and c) the poor travel by bus and not inter-city either, they travel by bus *within* their cities.

You could end up wasting a lot of money due to trying to help imaginary people from the past, and the result will be hurting real people in the present and helping the well-off!

If you actually said, lets provide bus-passes for the unemployed to help them get to interviews, I'd say great!

Down the other end of Bold Street there's **Raggas** which is just incredible value for money and also the food tastes fantastic. The service is a bit slow though which can be a pain.

**Byron** do, for my money, one of the best burgers in town. That's in Liverpool One. Just good quality burgers, cooked well, not drowning in every topping imaginable. Also seen **Free State Kitchen** mentioned which is very nice too.

**Slim's Pork Chop** is also pretty great too, that's on Duke Street.

but i see the Balon Do'r as a marketing tool. these accolades are given to boost player hype and marketing for them.

Rodgers on the other hand has four more years. The compensation would be substantial. I was thinking this might have been part of the reason why they will not let him go after this season. Along with giving a chance to some of last summer's signing to improve and impress in the next season.

This time next year Rodgers' contract will be another year shorter and he'll do some work for his pay, one way or another. Also it's probably last chance saloon for quite a few players in the current squad. If the manager changes a lot of the team will have to change as well. So it could well be that BR's recruitment is being curbed, but more for the mid-long-term purposes than the short-term.

I could imagine the arrangement the manager has with the owners is something along the lines of: ""here's another chance, we'll provide you with the staff and player changes we feel might help you improve, do well and you get to stay on and pick a few more players, don't do well...""

The last part is pure and absolute speculation of course. It will be very interesting to see who will come in to fill the voids in the coaching department. However we might never truly know who will have been deciding on those additions.

A minority I'm sure.

&gt;I'm quite sure the middle classes and higher have benefited from it. They wouldn't have implemented it if they thought for one moment it would have negatively effected their own standard of living.

Everyone (generally-speaking) has benefited from it. Although not desirable, your own personal circumstances are not representative, because it has been shown that immigrant Labour does not negatively affect wages. 

&gt;They basically betrayed their own core voters as far as I see it. Add in Iraq and it's no wonder they are dying as a party

I think Labour's betrayal of their core vote has nothing to do with their stance on immigration. Immigration isn't really that much of a problem for most people, Labour's problem comes with their response to Thatcher's years of economic reform, which took us from an industrial economy to a primarily service-based economy. Their occupation of the middle ground and refusal to provide any substantial alternative to the Conservative party during the New Labour years mean they are no longer a party of the working classes. Their immigration policy is largely irrelevant, because although you personally feel hard-done by their policies, the truth is that most have managed fine. Labour did oversee an extended period of economic growth during their time in power, and it would probably be true to say that we'd never had it better. The economic trouble we've encountered recently was due to a global financial crisis rooted in speculative trading on the US housing market; that is what damaged job prospects in our economy, we were doing fine with immigration before then and no doubt we will do fine with immigration once the economy is healthier. 

I think the reason Labour lost some support at the last election is because people jumped to other parties mostly because they didn't want to see Scottish Nationalist MPs in government and because the Conservatives successfully ran a propaganda campaign that convinced a lot of people that Labour's fiscal policies were to blame for the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, and ruined any confidence people had that Labour could run the country. Although Labour have betrayed their historically-core supporters, most people tend to align more centrally and see a leftward swing of the Labour party as a bad thing, and immigration certainly hasn't impacted Labour's support too badly because [only 10% of UKIP's support comes from former Labour voters, compared to 45% from former Conservative voters](http://www.may2015.com/ideas/whos-voting-for-ukip) (assuming UKIP as the party of choice for someone concerned about immigration primarily). 

Though in truth, I think it's probably wrong to say that Labour are dying as a party. Their vote share has been about 30% over the last two elections, and 35% at the 2005 election that gave them majority government. And though it is pretty awful that they did preside over the invasion of Iraq, evidently people don't care that much. Predominantly Conservative and Labour MPs voted for that invasion, and the combined vote share of those two parties last month was about 66%. 

Doubtless there have been people who no longer feel the Labour party can represent them and have changed allegiances, but obviously people feel the same about other parties and switch to Labour because their vote share stayed the same. The Labour party are fine, but I really think the issue of their disenfranchised former supporters (and more generally disenfranchised people from across the political spectrum) really needs to be addressed with real electoral reform to something more representative. I feel you are right when you say Labour no longer represent the working classes (though I disagree with your reasoning), and I think that can only be addressed by giving people alternatives and making sure those alternatives aren't handicapped by our stupid voting system.

Likewise education. We can't undo automation. So going back to 1960's policy, like the SNP and removing money from the schools budget to pay for tuition fees is plain cruel. It condemns a generation to fail their exams and ruins their lives because they won't be able to get any work a robot can't do. All so their betters get a free education while it deliberately restricts the bill by making sure not too many people pass the entrance requirements. How could you even call yourself leftwing and propose something that cruel?

Normally, the adventure in absentmindedness would have stopped there, but the gate guard was busy, so he didn't try to stop me. Nope. I went to the bus stop and waited for 5 whole minutes before thinking that the bus was taking an awfully long time to get there and I checked the time on my phone. I almost had a heart attack, it was an hour early! Shit! I sprinted back as fast as I could, and went to French as quickly as possible, 15 minutes late.

There are plenty of direct quotes from him about his thoughts on Balotelli, as well as the articles that came out when we were on the verge of signing him about how he was being asked to sign some unique contract tied to his behavior, so I assume they told him something along the lines of, ""He's the best we can get at the price"" and Rodgers had to swallow it with the hope that some of Balo's natural talent might prove useful. 

You can slag off Lovren all you want but the guy was just the scapegoat for a very poor overall performance from our team at the start of the season without a proper DM protecting the back 4. Rodgers' system requires both full backs to essentially be capable of bombing up the field and that's only possible with a set DM. We started with Gerrard there and it was an utter mess. But that's really not something I can blame on Rodgers. Phasing out a legend is being between a rock and a hard place. 

Lovren still has every chance to come good. He was great for Southampton. He was very good for Lyon. If he doesn't get his confidence this coming season then we can call it a bad signing but for now I'll just say it's an unfortunate set of circumstances.

And slagging off Lambert's signing is about as dumb as people slagging off signing Assaidi. He was brought in for pennies.

Here's the thing about strikers and good teams. Teams that can score some goals will score more goals. This occurs on a micro level in every game. If you can get a goal in the first 15 minutes, as we often did in our second season under Rodgers, the other team is forced to play the game wide open. In a wide open game we will beat most teams. Unfortunately we didn't have the ability to get that first goal easily or right away and that meant a striker like Lambert, who could have gotten a good 8-12 goal haul across competitions as a fourth striker, would have been considered a very solid signing.

Unfortunately he was forced to, when he was utilized, be our best goal scoring threat. Instead of, say, coming on at the 65th minute on and putting in the vital third goal to finish teams off. 

Either way, the dude cost us nothing. No one expected him to set the world alight. But no one would have cared if he played this exact same way if we'd gotten 4th. The extra scrutiny only comes from our finish and when that's the case you need to consider what the point is.

There is an argument that regional pay, with staff wanting to work in less popular areas being paid more could help solve the problem - but then there's the issue of fairness in that.

Mini-North/South divide in Wales.  N Wales and Anglesey are essentially a different functional unit to South Wales, and is kinda treated like the poor bastard child of the two.  All the tertiary and specialist centres are down south, so money has to be spent by North Wales for patients to go to Liverpool/Stoke/Widnes for specialist services.  There's also a relative brain drain from North Wales to South Wales - paramedic crews being one such group that Cardiff benefits from at the expense of other regions.

Geography - a big problem as Mid Wales is (for all intents and purposes - unpopulated - Aberystwyth aside.)  That and weavy roads mean that services have to serve a much larger area that affect how efficiently you can do things.  Powys doesn't have a DGH (poor population density) and people who live there have to travel to whichever DGH is closer.  N. Wales also has a disadvantage in that whilst UHW has the DGH at Merthyr to cover the Valleys, there is no equivalent DGH to cover a large swathe of the country.   The M4 is the only motorway as well - the A55 is nice - but nowhere near as well connected.  This problem isn't accounted for by and large by the people who write clinical guidelines - so Wales will inevitably fail some time critical measures of quality due to the fact that to meet, them, we would have to oversupply capacity.

Population - The hospitals in N. Wales serve a proportionally more elderly retirement population - with increased pressures.  Newport and the Valleys are deprived areas - with socioeconomic status having a well established (and thought to be relevant) correlation with health and healthy lives.

None of the above excuses any potential poor management involved, but the Welsh NHS has some rather unique problems.  ",null,0,null,1433798086,null,0,false,0,crzv5jq,null,t3_391o0n,null,t1_crzv5jq,null,t1_crzqbc0,null,null,null,1436831558,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

For the record, I fully support LGBT rights - including gay marriage.  I think that church and state should be completely separate.  It's up to the individuals and their denomination, and the state should facilitate that. 

So am I 'opposed' to homosexuality?  It's an odd question.  Some people are gay, and it's up to them what they do with their lives.  I am not the judge, Christ is.  It's my job to live my life as an example and to share the Gospel.  If a gay person converts to Christianity, how they handle their sexuality and their faith is up to them - some chose to be celebate, some don't.

I love my religion and I am watching people using it to murder, rape, kill, behead, massacre and commit genocide with it.

Return to Homs is a propaganda because it makes the rebels look very good compared to what they did. It makes Abdul Al-Sarout look like a good guy, instead of a sectarian thug and murder who has now joined Al-Qaeda or ISIS. Can't tell which. It makes the siege on them look as if it was done by an evil government. It wasn't. The government had to station thousands of troops because they were kidnapping and murdering people on the basis of religon. Just like Northern Ireland it caused a massive backlash. There was a moment when Christians and Alawites were so angry that they were ready to attack Sunnis regardless of what they have done. Did you know the famous video of a man eating a heart in Syria was in Homs? He ate the heart of an Alawite and threatened to eat more. That is what those people have dealt with.

How evil these men are was shown last year. They were lost and were about to be defeated. The UN, Red Cross and Western government threathened the Syrian government not to kill those terrorists. What happened? They let 2000 terrorists go with a rifle. Before they left they burnt down the Churches. None of the people they kidnapped three years ago have been found. Dead or alive. The first thing they did when they reached safety was to send a car bomb that massacred 30 Alawite kids.

Thinking about how they massacred those kids in the name of ""Sunnis"" really upsets me. Animals the whole lot of them. They deserve to be shot instead of filmed.



Your pov is a bit idealistic. Geopolitics is immoral at it's heart. The British government is wedded to the Saudis and Turks because the Americans are. They may not have directly helped ISIS but the massacre of Yazidis last year was the evolution of the ideology that Saudi Arabia and Turkey promotes. The UK or the US doesn't care about that. Which leds to the natural conclusion that the only way for the ME to be safe and secure is for Western influence to decline.

Balotelli I agree was foisted on Rodgers and that's not a good situation for a manager to be in. Loads of managers struggle to fit square pegs into round holes, but it was so painfully obvious that Balotelli did not fit our system at all. We would have been better off not signing Mario last summer and signing someone in January when Sturridge went down long term. One league goal? Any one of the academy strikers would probably have scored more than that. 

Lovren, I can't agree with you. I've seen players struggle to adapt but I've never seen a player for Liverpool bought for that kind of money and just being totally unable to play football for long stretches of time. He had zero communication or rapport with Skrtel or Sakho, constantly exposed Mignolet and generally just made the wrong decision whenever he had a choice to make. He clearly over-performed at Southampton because of Wanyama and Schneiderlin, along with Fonte next to him. He was a joke at Lyon and their fans were thrilled to see the back of him. 

My issue with Lambert's signing wasn't the cost which was obviously minimal, but that he took up a striker position that could have been filled by someone far younger, more mobile and better suited to play alongside our other players. Lambert, Lovren and Balotelli were, for various reasons, terrible signings either in terms of return, money spent or both. I would go so far as to say that, for the price paid, Lallana was a bad signing as well. If you take 25m quid to Spain you could come back with the next David Silva, not the Diet Coke Southampton version. 

It's not fair to blame solely Rodgers or solely the committee, but it's very clear that the transfer system as a whole is not working. No other top clubs have the issues closing deals like we do, nobody seems to leak as much bullshit to the media and I don't see many of those other teams signing players who are so poorly suited to play in their existing setup. At least 48m of the 75m gained from Suarez was spent on those Southampton boys for almost not return. That's 64% of the best payday we'll have from selling a player for a long, long time effectively wasted. That's totally unacceptable and whoever was responsible should not have the authority to waste that kind of money ever again.

Ok, let's be real here. I'm with you. I even joined the party for the same reasons. That sounds crazy but let me explain. (this will be a wall of text, soz :/)

I genuinely hate how UKIP has become infested with *actual racists*, sexists and homophobes.

I was, and still am, socially left. Quite liberal, but I do sway economically to the right.

I still buy a copy of The Gardian on Saturday because I believe that they are the best media organisation in the world. I believe in their cause although I totally disagree with them siding with Labour.

I understand all viewpoints and I'm willing to accept them.

I'm a member of UKIP because of what happened to my family. Something so personal as my experience would probably change your politics overnight too.

It's nothing to do with views about race, or sexual preference. I've even experimented with sexual exploration myself, and I found that I was hetro. No big deal, people do it all the time. It's a part of growing up.

You know what I found?

I was at the pub with Nigel Farage this weekend. That much is certainly true.

Inside were some of the most disgraceful people you could ever meet. Actual EDL members. I didn't see their UKIP membership numbers but if I did they would have been booted out on their arse and reported.

These people are the real problem here. Genuine people who care about our country are trying to make it better for our sisters and nieces, and then you get actual racists trying to join in.

I suggest getting acquainted with First Great Western's bike reservations for the trip down from London Paddington.  All train services to Cardiff and Swansea are provided by First Great Western.  Most do not require reservations for taking your bike, but a small amount of trains do - better safe than sorry.

Inside Wales, almost all trains are run by Arriva Trains Wales, a different company.  They're stricter with the number of bikes on their services (smaller trains), so I'd book as far in advance as you can.  [Link.](http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/Bicycles/)

There's clearly a preference for British players there. We didn't get all of them, but we definitely put bids in for all of them.

Couple that with Rodgers saying stuff like: ""But British players are just as good technically and tactically as their European counterparts. That was always my idea – to put that into a team.”

It's hard to argue that we don't like British players.

Then look at the others we have been linked with in the past. Benteke. Vorm. Mignolet. Dempsey. All 'premier league proven'.

You won't get democratic socialism but you might be able to get social democracy if you were willing to look at the world as it is now and forge new types of policies.

For example, lots of the people who claim there is a ""left-wing"" route to power point to the SNP - but as I've shown, they are left-wing only in rhetoric - and paradoxically that is the secret of their success, people like left-wing *talk* but don't like left-wing *action*. They raise less taxes than Tories, their schtick is either to lie (as in teh referendum when they claimed that $116 per barrel was ""conservative"" and the price could be ""three times that"" or $330 - even though in the entire history of oil it's only been above $100 for five years and is now $65 a barrel), or they try to bludge money out of England in the name of solidarity (""if you really wanted us in the union you would shower us with money"" or ""If you really wanted us in the union you would exempt us from all cuts and let them all fall on the English"".

England can't pull off that trick, who can we bludge money off? And we can't raise household taxes either. But there are other sources - for example if we left the EU we would suddenly be able to tax Google and Starbucks and other companies for profits earned in the UK. Or we could at least attempt to reform the EU so we could levy those taxes.

*But Labour is refusing to do either*. Refusing to countenance leaving and worse, refusing to countenance reforming the EU in our way (leaving it up to the Conservatives to write the wish-list for reforms according to *their* tastes). And why? Small c conservatism again. We've got to leave things as they've always been. Which is rubbish of course. The world has changed, and we have the right to respond, we shouldn't have to cleave to the past willy-nilly. Yet that is Labour policy.

The irony is that Blair was the keenest on the EU but it is those who hate him that are most keen on the EU and most resistant to any change on this. 

(On the EU Yvette Cooper looks like the best candidate, Burnham will rubber stamp all EU nonsense and it's not clear what Kendall's polcies are).

Anyway, all I'm arguing for is a willingness to grapple with policies for the world as it is now. The idea that ""true Labour"" means cleaving to policies from the olden days willy-nilly is daft.

Phone HMRC. Ask them whether you need to be in Self Assessment. They'll check your circumstances against the criteria, and if it turns out you don't meet then they'll take you out of SA.

However, if you do meet the criteria then HMRC will just say ""you should have known that you have to do a tax return. Ignorance is not an excuse"", and you will probably not be in a position to make an appeal.

Criteria includes things like additional income over certain limits; benefits or expense claims over certain limits; previous years underpayments that cannot be coded out; even debts from tax credits for example that are being collected through your tax code; having an income over 50k and receiving child benefit; and so on. Ultimately its each individual's responsibility to check whether they should be in SA. If you shouldn't be in SA, all you need to do is make a quick call.

I've never got paid enough to continually feel like I was the grim reaper. 

I've even been accosted by a fucker who told me I was a cunt for doing my job WHILE HE HAD A FUCKING NEWSPAPER IN HIS HAND.

You don't want to actually pay for news. That's fucking obvious. Papers ABCs are dropping through the floor. You's don't understand the difference between news and editorial most of the time either.

Either live in a world of no news or fucking pay for news. Its a terrible thing. But publications need advertising to be able to do their job. Because no one wants to pay this is what its come to.  

Or just post BBC stories and deal with their shit non-investigative short articles written by people sitting in Blackstaff. 

You fuckers don't even want stories any more. You'd rather have video or pix. Papers wouldn't be dumbing down if you lot hadn't stopped actually paying bona fide journalists to do their job [edit: or had attention spans bigger than the average seven year old]. 

People die, infants, teenagers, everyone. You want to read about it? Pay for it, journalists need a wage too. 

Maybe if you's bitched as much about our over inflated civil service, terrorists or evangelicals or perpetrator ""victims"" of violence getting money I'd give more of a fuck. 

Quick caveat - its terrible what happened to this kid. I worked on a similar story in Scotland. The Scottish police and police from Thailand [I think, it was a while ago] were working together to catch the cunts who made him jump off the Forth bridge after he sent them pix and he was blackmailed by them.

Still think we need an efficient right back, Clyne, Janmaat or maybe even Trippier. 

I think Milner is experienced enough, strong enough and smart enough to play deep. And if he wants to bomb forward Hendo has the energy and know-how to fill in. Can has the ability to replace either of these two if anything happens, although Lucas would be better defensively obviously, than Can. 

I loved Coutinho in CM vs City in 13/14.

We qualified for the CL with Gomes in goal, fucken Fabianski had 13 clean sheets and was in the running for the golden glove! 

Keeper is really the only position in the game where you can realistically get away with having 1 good player. They hardly get injured, you don't need to really rotate them to keep them fit etc. This means finding a above average keeper is generally easier and cheaper than any other position on the field. Fraser Forster only cost Southampton about 10 mill.

Sure I'd like Hugo to stay, and for us to continue to have one of the best keepers in the world between the sticks for us. But if we sold him **outside the league** for 20+mill, and used that to strengthen our DM position or back line, then I wouldn't be too worried at all.

Apply for a working holiday visa online for Australia, I printed the form off online and sent it to them with my brothers card details so they could take the payment. A few months later I got a letter saying they had approved my application.

Go here after you get approved - http://www.seek.com.au/ and apply for all the jobs you're interested in. You'll find you will get knocked back or ignored most of the time but you will find an employer that will give you an interview on skype, the Australians are forward and will tell you there and then if you get the job or not. If they give you the job they'll give you a start date.

You'll usually have a few weeks before you start work, especially on cattle stations, it's important you travel out to Australia a few days before you're due to start work, I learned this the hard way, it took me 2 days to get to Adelaide from London and I never slept at all. When I finally arrived it took me a further day to get to my station so I was nearly dead during my induction. My boss was nice though (scouser too) and let me have a few days off before I started work so I could acclimatize and catch up on sleep.

I know you said you wanted bar work but I think it would be best to start out on a cattle station, get used to the way of life and then move on. Most cattle stations give you a place to stay and something to eat so you don't have to worry about accommodation which also is a big expense if living on your own.

You'll find that hardly no place of work gives cash in hand, it all has to go into a bank account. I'm not sure how simple it is to set a proper account up but all I used was a pre-paid mastercard that I could have my wages deposited into. There was a fee of $15 a month for that though.

If you're going by yourself then you will be restricted to what jobs you can take. Accommodation is expensive and wages for low-skilled jobs in big cities wont cover it unless you go with a mate or family member who will also be working and can assist with paying accommodation fees.

So to sum it up, get a visa, apply for a job (with accommodation included if going by yourself), book your flight and set up a bank account/prepaid card.

P supplied a substance to R in accordance with the offer, be likely to

Nah. The key is that ""and"" there. It would be illegal to sell if it were reasonable for the seller to assume that it's going to be misused. Which, isn't too far from the law on glue now. They can sell it to 16 year olds, but if they are of the belief it's going to misused then the age goes up to 18.

This is actually a well thought out bill, they have thought about avoid criminalising people that aren't making and selling what is thought of as a ""legal high"".

Two year loan deal. Atletico Madrid have the option to pay a small fee to us for Manquillo to return after one year, if they wish. (So, that would be sometime this summer window). After the second year, we have the option to purchase Manquillo on a permanent basis, if we wish, for £5m (?).

Therefore if Manquillo impressed then Atletico would be more inclined to take him back, whereas by taking him out of the lineup, Atletico are less aware of his progress. Along with this speculation though, we all know BR takes young players out of the line upor a few weeks/months anyway and they come back better.

This kid was reported as being invited to have a trial and tour the training complex last week so I assume Vieira and Wilcox liked what they saw and signed him based on that, rather than just blind faith on scouting reports and some Ligue 2 games. 

We've saved him from getting relegated to Ligue 3 as well and I'm sure his club could really do with the €250k we paid them so tbh sounds like a good move for everyone.

CC is a license, not the law, and it certainly doesn't apply to anything and everything. Despite what it says on his site, he can't (and I did look this up to check) simply use it when using other people's material. I also don't consider it to be fair dealing/use considering his usage doesn't match any of the [exceptions applied](https://www.gov.uk/exceptions-to-copyright) and is doing it under commercial use. Therefore, it's a derivative work (which isn't surprising since, while it's more visually aesthetic, it's incredibly similar to the official one) and you can't just decide to sell them without permission.

Of course, this is not even mentioning the whole using the TARDIS, which is trademarked, which also requires permission and is not at all subject to CC licenses. Of course, an awful lot of people do this, but most of them do it non-commercially so the BBC turn a blind eye a lot of the time (after all, in some cases, removing it would hurt the fandom, causing a disconnect, and do more harm than good). Just because he hasn't received a C&amp;D yet, doesn't mean it's legal and allowed. Hell, I got one of those after FOUR years. It's not instant.

On the note of the quote, Neon's videos existing is in no way disproving Moffat's quote. He clearly says ""I"". Hell, not all of Neon's videos contain original ideas (and most are just the same ideas over and over again). But forgetting that, Moffat (along with the majority of other TV producers in the world) is known for emphasizing a lot for publicity, and this was just before the series 8 premiere.

They seem to encounter the Doctor more closely as we approach Trenzalore. The ladder two both told the Doctor, ""Run you clever boy and remember..."" before dying.

Modern Clara said the full line before jumping in, ""Run you clever boy and remember me""

It is then possible that Clara created herself, as she says that she was created to save the Doctor. We then see her save the Doctor on Trenzalore by getting him more regenerations from the Time Lords. 

The Doctor then followed Clara into his own time steam, were they encountered a memory of the War Doctor, adding set up to the 50th Anniversary.
