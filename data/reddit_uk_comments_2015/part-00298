Companies where all they do is present news know this, and they also know that if they present you nothing but depressing shit all the time, you're going to get bummed out and leave. I personally know that I get sick of people fixating on negativity all the time - sure it's important, but holy fuck is it depressing. ""12 died in car bombing, up next, people in detention are being abused, later tonight, puppies are being tortured in farms all over Britain"". That gets to you eventually, and I don't want that every day.

The reason Al Jazeera doesn't care about this stems from the fact that Al Jazeera isn't a news company. They're a fact-gathering journalism company. They don't analyse the facts, they literally just go out and pay journalists to collect them without any bias or analysis. That's what they do. Oh sure, some of the stuff they collect they do present, but the presentation is very minimal by way of analysis and tries to keep it as restricted as possible.

**This is because Al Jazeera is not a news company**. People don't watch Al Jazeera to the exclusion of other news - news agencies license snippets from Al Jazeera to present on THEIR news broadcasts. The customers for BBC TV news is the viewer. The customers for Al Jazeera are BBC TV news and friends. 

So, they can ignore stuff like Cilla's death because they don't CARE if people get bummed out. That's not their business model. However, TV news can't afford to only give you negativity and ""important"" stuff, because it would result in people just leaving.

It's not that TV is ""dumbing down"" the news. It's that news is wising up to the fact that nobody can handle negativity every day.

EDIT: Also, don't forget that ""car bomb kills 12"" gets really samey after a while. People just start going ""eh, what's new, that's old news, we don't care any more. We want something new and interesting"". Cilla doesn't die every day, but nameless Arabic people do.

If you go for a drive in the countryside there are plenty of lovely little pubs serving food.  Just avoid Aylesham, Elvington and Eythorne.

The volunteers, both Irish and Ulster, were strategic political weapons that probably the UUC used to greatest advantage - Redmond's volunteers being undermined by an actual outbreak of violence among Irish republicans in 1916. It was this republican violence that copper fastened partition in that year, only for Carson to manage to bring down the government and as he seen it, give all of Ireland another chance to stay with the status quo.

Did the uvf change minds of others? Certainly changed that of the liberal Churchill:

&gt;if Ulster had confined herself simply to constitutional agitation, it is extremely improbable that she would have escaped forcible inclusion in a Dublin parliament

Did Britain really not give a fuck about Ireland? Obviously not, given the conservatives unionist position.

There's just no simple way of tackling it quickly without causing a whole world of hurt to the UK's economy. The joke is that the people doing the same jobs as most of the 'well off' people in London today are going to end up far worse off and nothing can feasibly be done about that; our entire country's economy is propped up by one city, dragging nearly all of the traditional 'high earning' professions into it only to then prevent them to ever actually save any money. House prices have risen 5-7x faster than wages, yet these huge companies can't / won't raise wages by anywhere near that amount - especially when there's a workforce of intelligent and insanely hard working people growing by the day in the Far East.

Seriously, there is no treaty that prohibits nationalisation. If you think there is, cite your sources.

I'll cite mine to be fair. Here is a lovely Q&amp;A between an MEP and the European Commission. 

[This is the question by an MEP regarding nationalising steel works in Belgium.](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+P-2011-010146+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN)

[This is the reply by the Commission.](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=P-2011-010146&amp;language=FR) Unfortunately in French only, but I'll translate the interesting bits below (highlighting mine):

&gt;Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission

&gt;According to Article 345 of the Treaty on Functioning of European Union (TFEU), the treaties do not prejudice the system of ownership in Member States. Therefore, **there is no Community provision prohibiting the principle of nationalization (or regionalization) of a company**.

&gt;It should be clear that in such circumstances, the public authority making the nationalization (or regionalization) should behave like a private investor in a market economy both in regard to the purchase price and the management of the business. Otherwise, the provisions of the TFEU (Articles 107 and 108) relating to State aid would apply.

So there's no problem at all with nationalisation, as long as the state runs it like a private investor and pays a market price. Only where they don't do that do rules about emergency state aid kick in.

To my knowledge, Brown's government didn't so much ""ask permission"" to nationalise the banks in 2007/8, as check with the Commission that their plans were within the rules (which they dutifully confirmed they were). There is nothing that the Commission can grant or refuse permission for in this regard- either it's within the rules (and allowed) or not (and not). If it's against the rules, the Commission can't ""give you permission"" to do it anyway- they don't have that power.",null,0,null,1438613981,null,null,false,0,ctpxndj,null,t3_3fj3ao,null,null,null,t1_ctpqg7v,null,null,null,1440254234,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Hey Guys,

First of all, I will add the timestamp as soon as I get home from work :)

I have an extra i5 4590 still in the box unopened and undamaged with everything that it usually comes with. Selling it as my brother gave me a 4690k so I will not use it for my girlfriend's computer.


Difference between buying it from me or amazon is £10 just because I am not going to use it.


Looking either for money or a used/new low to mid-range gpu. I currently have a r7 250 and I was thinking about an upgrade to the upcoming GTX 950. Will change my mind if I get a good deal here so feel free to show me what you have :)


Able to pickup in the manchester area. Also able to post it.

Cheers

-As you are married i believe your spouse would inherit everything (after tax), if you want to bequeath any personal items to anyone you should make a will, to ensure that there are no issues.

-To decide who gets what it is completely a personal choice, although if there any possessions you have which have shared sentimental value with someone i would suggest giving that item to them.

-You don't actually have to have a will set up by a solicitor or online, you can do it yourself. I believe the requirements are that it has to be written (there are a few exceptions, such as servicemen), although it does not necessarily state on what (there have been cases of wills written on egg shells).  It must be signed and dated by two witnesses who do not receive anything in the will. You must also be over 18, be of sound mind and make it voluntarily. If you make it yourself make a few copies and keep them in different locations and let your executor know where they are. 

-Your executor is the person you trust most to make sure the whole process runs smoothly and is not a giant fuck up, as many family arguments start over wills  

-You do not need to make a new will each time, although i suggest you do for big events such as marriage,divorce, childbirth, moving house and if your executor dies. I would suggest reviewing your will every few years 

- To amend your will you do not alter the original document but instead make something called a codicil, which must be signed and witnessed in the same way as a new will, then store the codicil in the same place as your will.


-Personal advice, as you are married and are unsure what to do if you both die, i would put in a clause which reads something like: I leave all my possessions to my partner as long as she exceeds me by 30 days, if not my possessions go the following people. Clauses like this are very common.

Firmino and Milner should also help in the goal scoring, never mind the other guys.

With a squad like Benteke (or Ings) upfront, Firmino, Coutino and Ibe behind him, Milner and Hendo in the middle, Can as a DM, and a defence with Clyne and Sakho, I feel better going in.

null,null,redzor,,Newcastle,null,"One aspect from my partner's family who is a small dairy cow farmer. Is that all the tractors driving up to stormont the otherway destroyed their legitimacy of a protest. People see those new tractors all shiny and know how insanely expensive they are. Not only that but farmers can apply for funding on those but it turns out its a loan.

So pretty much an insane amount of debt is put onto farmers who are unable to get out of dairly farming. You cannot just send all your cows to the factory we dont eat dairy cows here. Nor do we eat veal from the cows who they cannot milk nor afford to keep feeding.

The cost of maintaining a cow is growing year on year. And local food is always good news.

If a cow dies, farmers have to pay money to the government for that. milking equipment runs electric bills into insane amounts. If you dont milk your cows they can develop medical problems. If at all miss anything your cows health will suffer.

There is alot to dairy farming people tend to glance over. And the problem lies that there is massive supply but the demand is already being meet locally. The natural progression of supply and demand will force the milk price to go down or you end up wasting your product. Dairy farmers are so preoccupied most of have forgot how to be useful at all.

They really need to start adding value to their products. Like local mozzarella for the local pizza shops (very easy to make 30min job). Or home made butter. Or clotted cream. Or ice-cream. All of these are low cost, easy to learn things to do with their product their family is more than happy to help always.

I think farmers are in need to business training now a days to understand their issues properly. Not only that but i think food production is seriously tits up in the UK.

The shortage of feeds last year for animals was insane. People paying thousands of pounds for pretty much nothing just to keep their animals alive. And we shell out thousands locally to charities all the time where money rarely reaches the needy. Nothing like our well kept grass feed cattle (when its not raining) which are free to roam as they please and have a healthy natural life away from hormones.

Its time for farmers to get serious about self sufficiency thats how their grand parents done it. But it requires the government to help out. We have the best dairy in the world in NI in my opinion. You go to america and you make butter from their cream you can clearly see the difference in quality in a massive way. Our milk is much more natural and almost yellow'y, american stuff is all bleached and has very low fat content.

Actually, I think we should sell Adebayor and keep Soldado. Yet for some reason the club looks to be selling both before signing a replacement, which is an incredibly dangerous game which will also see the price of any striker we sign skyrocket.

&gt; Because that was under AVB. Only playing well under a manager you like is not a good character trait.

Or it could be indicative of bad man management.

&gt; Second choice is not first team football.

Then why are you in this thread? This whole debate is about having Adebayor as a backup striker. How are you still not getting this?

It's just one action. I'd also say the parliamentary democracy that Britain has given to Ireland has allowed Ireland to develop more secularly and begin to throw off the shackles of Catholicism. The legal system [as I found out recently] is generally based off of English law as well. So there's that little nugget too.... The laws of the land are quite beneficial in my view.

Not to mention that the first time the English came to war here was at the behest of an Irish King. King of Leinster if I remember correctly.  

I don't want to delve into a massive debate with you because I already don't care for your tone or the fact that by giving this example I now have to talk about the Uk globally. 

And we can't do that without talking about the Ottomans, the Romans, the Austro-Hungarians, the development of Europe into what it is today and so many other historical activities that we'd get bogged down and you already seem to be blanketing yourself in some kind of collective victimhood. 

[EDIT]: I also think the British gave the Irish, and many parts of the world, the idea of a professional police force. The RIC was the first one and the Garda are based off it. And I'm pretty sure the Royal Navy helps give protection to Irish waters. If not for them the Spanish Armada would be back but to take your fish and not to fire cannon balls.

Jailing this guy for ""20 to 40 years"" (more than  many murders get by the way) serves no purpose other than as a vindictive punishment for the sake of it. The goal of public protection is served by simply banning him from working in finance (which is also a pretty massive punishment, since it destroys his career) and the atonement element can be accomplished through fines/community service etc.

null,null,redditacc2015,null,null,null,"Well yes exactly, the people who own the houses at the moment aren't complaining - the government has seen to that. They're just looking at the value of their house rising and their low interest mortgage and seeing green. Take a guy born in 1962 who lives in North London and has a household income of £100k per year in the private sector. His pension will have been shat on but he couldn't care less because he has his house which he bought for £400k in 2000 with a £300k mortgage. He's now sitting pretty looking at Zoopla and seeing a £1.5m valuation for his 4 bedroom 2400 square foot house, and he's not bothered about paying off his mortgage at the moment because the interest rate's so low. Instead he's made some decent investments, goes on holiday a lot and is chilling. 

Who on earth does he think is going to buy his house? He bought it aged 38 having worked his way up to a decent middle management level alongside his wife's teaching job. He got on the property ladder at 26 buying a small flat for next to nothing, which he then sold (incidentally his biggest regret in life because it's now worth £1m), and a few upgrades later ended up in the £400k property. So what's he expecting, all of the current crop of young professionals working for companies paying pretty much the same as they did in 2000 to suddenly come up with £1.5m when banks are refusing to give out mortgages even a fraction of what they would 15 years ago? He could stay in there until he dies and passes it along (if he pays the mortgage off) but then it'll be a pretty boring retirement. House prices surely have to drop.

It's a completely untenable position, and the property prices at the moment are just being propped up by rich foreign investors and the early to mid 70s crowd who could still get onto the housing market back in the early 2000s.

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"Austerity is such a buzz-word. Labour has always throughout it's entire history espoused Keynesian economics as the ""one true way"" of running an economy. Keynesian economics say that you should be relatively liberal with the spending during the bad times (as the Darling plan back in 2010 would have done), especially on capital spending, and then try to run a surplus during the good times (helped by flogging off or profiting from some of those capital assets you built up during the bad times).

Like it or not, the economy has been growing consistently since 2013. That's about 3 years later than it should have been thanks to Slasher Osborne, but he still got us there eventually. Labour absolutely should be talking about bringing the deficit into check now; to argue for continued stimulus spending during growth years is economically illiterate. And what's more, the public are already bloody near unanimous on the subject; they *will* punish us for that.

Fighting tooth and nail against ""austerity"" was the *correct thing to do* back in 2010, but it is not now it's 2015, and almost certainly won't be come 2020. We will never win an election fighting last decade's battles.

What we need to do now is focus on rebalancing the economy, and making sure that the Tories don't ""rebalance the books on the backs of the poor"" while using growth to offer huge tax giveaways to their rich chums. That's an entirely different debate to one about whether balancing the books is a good idea in the first place.

Parties like the Greens can offer unlimited money to everyone forever safe in the knowledge that they'll never be in a position to actually do anything about it.

And there is no collective victim hood. I just can't wrap my head about anyone claiming that they're a force for good in the world. Thats straight up white washing, revisionist history.

Its happened with the Romans, Ottomans, The Huns and pretty much every other major power historically, given time I'm sure the same will be said for things happening right now. But that doesn't mean that they're a force for good, it just means that people have forgotten the impact of their negative actions. 

I'm not and have never once said that the colonialism never done anything good. I'm saying that the bad shit that came with it far outweighs the good, making it impossible for the phrase ""a force for good"" to be used by anyone who the most basic of historical knowledge.

The argument for Homeopathy being available on the NHS is that it provides doctors with a non-medical option that can provide the benefits of placebo without any potential harms. The counter-argument is to just provide sugar pills for this purpose, however it could be argued that there is a moral/ethical difference between a doctor providing someone with a pill and lying to them about what it is, and providing a homeopathic medicine, being honest about what it is, and allowing the patient to draw any conclusions about the medical benefit it will provide them.

I do feel uncomfortable about it as I believe, for obvious reasons, that it can be dangerous to allow misinformation about the effectiveness of homeopathic medicine (which is, essentially, no more than the placebo effect) to spread, but I can see the obvious reasons that doctors would like to be provided with that option. Plus I believe that ultimately the wellbeing of patients should be the top priority with health spending, and that probably trumps the potential spreading of misinformation.

null,null,pepe_le_shoe,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; the way to create jobs 

The truth that people don't seem to either know about or accept, is that the jobs exist, they just exist in London and the south-east, and require skills that our workforce hasn't necessarily been trained to provide.

If you want companies to move outside of London, you'll have to pay them in the short term, because for 99% of business, being in London will bring you the most advantage. Networking, (Employee) talent, and a disproportionately large/wealthy pool of potential clients. 

Even if your head office is somewhere else, you'll need an office in London if you're a large company, and people will always want to go there instead of where your head office actually is (I've seen this at multiple companies).

If you incentivise companies to move more operations outside London (admittedly very hard, because we let the problem go on too long without dealing with it), the rest will follow. People will go where the work is, and if a company sets up shop in a town, people will move to be within commuting distance, and more local stores will show up to service the increased demand. 

But, then you have to contend with all the nimbys who don't want lots of new people, businesses, office buildings, and blocks of flats, in their nice, quiet, economically unsustainable town.

&gt; Invest in rejuvenating a town centre by building planters and repaving walkways (creating jobs, albeit temporary ones, in the process). 

You can have the nicest pavement in the world, but if there's no job for me in your town, I won't move there. You don't need to attract me. In 2015, most people don't even have a choice, they get a job, 1 job, and they move where that job is.

&gt;Invest in building amenities, such as libraries, that will employ people and provide desired services.

Libraries don't need large staff, and don't draw people or businesses to an area.

&gt; Invest in infrastructure such as wider roads

Lol, they don't do this in places that are bursting and overcrowded, they aren't going to do it in places that are quiet and not overcrowded.

&gt;subsidised public transport

You'll have to wait a few election cycles... and even then, any subsidy is unlikely to offset the price increases between now and then.

&gt;better rail connection

in the UK? I can't wait 25 years.

&gt; fibre optic internet

Fibre is actually available in a lot of places, and a business will just pay the cost to get a line installed, which may or may not make it available to the surrounding area, depending on what they get/where they are/who their provider is (a lot of business internet providers don't do residential).
If you want fibre for your house, keep telling your isp, and try to organise a local group on your street. Between 10-20 houses, it shouldn't be hard to get together the ~5 grand needed for virgin to run a fresh line.

&gt; that businesses looking for a place to locate their newest office think that town might be a good option.

The biggest cost for businesses is the office space. They literally do not give a shit about the area, or whether there's fibre for the local residents. I have seen tonnes of office moves, none of that stuff is ever a factor. Companies looking to move will plonk themselves in the middle of fucking nowhere, if the rent on the office space is a few grand cheaper than their alternative option.

relegations... Quinn running back up the touchline to tell us a draw wasn't enough. (End of prem) Pollock lobbing the keeper from about 30 yards with a header in the penultimate game, and then beating Stoke 5 2 in final game and both getting relegated.

On the other hand, Moreno is older and more experienced now, but he was awful last season - he cost us a lot of points and made lots of errors, and has been the same during pre-season and should have done better for the Swindon goal yesterday.

I would say stick with Gomez, unfortunately Moreno hasn't shown enough last season or in pre-season to give me faith, whereas although it was against shitty opposition, Gomez has played incredibly well, so to be fair to him he should be given the spot since he has earned it with his performances. You can only beat you who're put against, so we can't use that against Gomez, he played better than Moreno and that's the bottom line, so for me, he gets the nod, but realistically I don't think he's our answer in the long term for LB.

Was it hard? No. Ish. The training we receive to ride motorbikes makes us hyper road aware compared to most drivers and we tend to preempt circumstances far further in advance. 

The difficulties came with adjusting to the size of the vehicle and the controls. Frankly, the ergonomics of car controls are TERRIBLE by comparison to motorbikes. On a motorbike ever single critical control is directly at our fingertips, seemingly perfectly organised to be used almost subconsciously. In a car they are all over the place. Imagine having to take your hands off the controls to change you headlight settings, to change gears. Imagine having to fundamentally change your grip on the handlebars to activate your indicators. Now imagine that even a substantially powerful car (I drive my wife's 1.6 litre turbodiesel Audi A1) requires by far more pronounced control movements on the throttle, starring wheel and brake and clutch controls. Everything feels slow, inefficient and laborious. And of course, they are big, clumsy vehicle by comparison, slow speed manoeuvres like reversing round a corner or driving through tight spaces are filled with an unnerving feeling that it's guess work, that the position of the vehicle is at best estimated, its horrible by comparison.

&gt;*Yes let's exit the EU - **as we know, all foreigners are rapists and murderers...** and some, I assume, are good people.*

I never said that. I don't see the relevance. Don't try put words into my mouth you dishonest cunt.

Unless you are being prejudiced yourself. That's an extreme assertion to make.

I specifically mentioned the word vet:

&gt;**vet** /vɛt/

&gt;*verb*

&gt;*make a **careful and critical examination** of (something).*

There are some 10,000s of foreign criminals in our prisons today. These are people who committed crimes elsewhere then came here, unconditionally due to EU policy, to then be arrested for their actions here. To *vet* them, which we can't now, allows us to check criminal histories and react appropriately. **That doesn't mean that all foreigners are criminals like you try to frame.** It just means that we can prevent the ones that are from entering and thus such crimes.

I must ask why you felt the need to make such statement? :

&gt;*Yes let's exit the EU - as we know, all foreigners are rapists and murderers... **and some, I assume, are good people.***

Do you think that I hate all immigrants or something? Is that your prejudice speaking?

More prison places would then, due to less crowded prisons, knock on to the courts being run efficiently and offenders playing out their full time which would mean less criminals on the street appropriately and a strong faith and deterrent in British justice.

&gt;&gt;*You don't want to be illegally detained right? You know, without trial or evidence?*

&gt;***Because our government would never detain people without trial...***

Sarcasm. Again.

I never said that *did I*?

&gt;This reminds me very much of Jordon Ibe at the start of last season, getting in the right positions but ruining chances with a poor cross or pass.

When Ibe was playing for the first team for the first few times he was still taking on players and beating them, his cross/finish might have been shit but he was beating people and causing problems, I have not seen this from Markovic at all, he doesn't take anyone on, he doesn't beat anyone with pace, he doesn't cross well, he doesn't shoot well, I really am baffled how he is rated so highly.",null,0,null,1438617677,null,null,false,0,ctpzwkx,null,t3_3fmph2,null,null,null,t3_3fmph2,null,null,null,1440255297,null,4,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

Benzoyl peroxide absolutely decimates the skin barrier IMO it is not suited to sensitive skin. Also it can be photosensitising so sunscreen is important. Although your cleanser is gentle there is nothing 'giving back' to your skin barrier, it is just 'take' or 'attack'.

For PIH sunscreen is critical, ideally all year round but at least when the UV index is 3+ (April onwards, even many cloudy and rainy days, see the Met Office website). Ideally for acne you would use a zinc oxide sunscreen - naturally anti bacterial - but these are a challenge to in in the UK.

All 3 of our main CBs attack the ball, mostly to try to cause a turnover or break down the attack as quickly as possible. They make more interceptions than either Cahill or Terry, but far more errors and fouls (as you will if you press the forwards so aggressively). 

The shielding point is a good one, definitely. A lot of the ""pressing"" is actually closing down because the ball has easily been moved behind our midfield line. That's our biggest problem - and I am hoping the Hendo/Milner experiment fixed it.

[Corbyn sponsored an anti-Israel event that had neo Nazis speaking at it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqAn_U3ddXE)

He's a part of the [Palestine Solidarity Campaign](http://palestinesolidaritycampaign.com/) which supports destroying of the state of Israel.

Corbyn has compared Israel to Nazis, and he shares a podium with Islamists. He accepts marches being segregated by gender to appease Islamists. Leafleters freely gave out Islamist literature which called for ""Putting the Jews to the sword"". Other leaflets called for a boycott of ""Israeli goods"" while, in fact, demanding the boycott of businesses such as Marks and Spencers which have historically been owned by Jews.

Corbyn supports a boycott of all Israeli goods, while he has no problem with doing business with the dozen Islamic countries that execute gays. Since Israel supplies 750 truck loads of goods to Gaza *every day*, a boycott does far more to harm the Palestinians than to Israel. 

He's a friend to Raed Salah, who said last year: ""Inshallah, Jerusalem will soon become the capital of the global caliphate.""

If you make somebody aware of something they are far more likely to report on it afterwards, a form of confirmation or selection bias. Confirmation bias in the sense that if you have a slight stomach ache previously you would have put that down to nothing, if you were on the clinical trial drug you are now probably more likely to blame the drug since you signed the form saying it may do this and to note the side effects for the research conditions.

First, the sugar rush of novelty. A republican Marxist peacenik fronting Her Majesty’s loyal opposition is a story to please radicals and entertain bored neutrals. As Jeremania spreads, commentators, devoted to the craft of reading too much into transient commotion, will suggest he “has a point” about capitalism and “engages young people” with his “authentic” idiom.



This credulous guff will go on until political gravity does its remorseless work, perhaps by the end of the year. Voters will grow bored of the joke. The unstable compound of trade union heavies and teenage dreamers that is Team Corbyn will melt down. Labour MPs will show no loyalty to a man who has voted against their party more than 500 times since 1997. Ideas such as zero austerity and withdrawal from Nato will lose their eccentric charm and acquire the infamy they deserve. Mr Corbyn will fall soon enough, and certainly before the 2020 general election.


The hard left will wail but with the pinched vocal cords of people who secretly know they are getting what they want. Their mission is to vent, not to rule. The more insidious threat to Labour is actually the soft left, with its undeserved sheen of respectability.


These are the people who elected Ed Miliband as leader in 2010 and egged him on through every vainglorious showdown with corporate Britain until he crashed into the electorate on May 7. Having shown such marvellous judgment five years ago, they now want him replaced by Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper, with their better-presented versions of continuity Labour. They still caress the dream of winning an election while situated some way to the left of Tony Blair, despite the evidence of the past two elections. Sadiq Khan, the London mayoral hopeful, is of the soft left, as are shadow cabinet members Hilary Benn and Lucy Powell. Ms Cooper and Mr Burnham themselves increasingly match the description.


On May 8, these people had a lot to answer for. Three months on, they count as moderates. By standing still as their party spasms leftward, they have attained a spurious credibility. Labour’s proximate problem is Mr Corbyn but its ultimate problem is the soft left. When he burns out, these crack election-losers will still be there, looking plausible and being diligently wrong about things.



Ms Cooper does not believe the previous Labour government was wrong to run a fiscal deficit after 15 years of economic growth. Both she and Mr Burnham think families should be entitled to tax credits for a third child. These views are not mad. They are just a bit too leftwing for Britain. For any serious party, that amounts to the same thing. The soft left is more electable than the hard left but then Mars is more habitable than Neptune: neither planet will host human life anytime soon.


Boil away the rhetoric exchanged by Mr Blair’s defenders and his Milibandite critics, and what remains is an argument about electoral viability. The soft left believe Labour can be more social-democratic than Mr Blair was and still win, even if it means smaller parliamentary majorities than those he achieved. Mr Blair has always doubted there can be a majority at all if the party departs a “millimetre” from the vigilant centrism of his own government. For him, the relationship between ideological positioning and electoral success is non-linear: a marginal move to the left does not cost a marginal number of votes.


The evidence is on his side. In 2010, Gordon Brown veered slightly from Mr Blair and lost. In 2015, Mr Miliband did the same and lost again. Twice in a row, Labour has scored a lower vote share than the Tories managed in 1997, when they were so roundly hated that a bill to proscribe them by law would have aroused only a few murmurs of disapproval from the Home Counties. The median Briton, who is 40 years old, has never seen Labour win a general election except under Mr Blair.


So, when Mr Corbyn goes, Labour will not be primed for power. That will require those on the soft left to retreat, too. They can start by admitting their complicity in his dizzying climb. It was their coded disavowals of New Labour that legitimised the more vicious renunciations we see now. It was their cultivation of excitable youngsters and blowhard celebrities that changed Labour from a professional political machine to a zoo where any passing chancer who voted Green five minutes ago can abuse long-serving MPs as traitors and apostates. Their legacy is a party that welcomes the slightly unelectable, the very unelectable and almost nobody else.

2. I think Gomez has probably been one of the standouts in terms of promise, he's played with great maturity and confidence for someone who is only 18 years old, although Bentekes goal is the standout moment of pre season for me.

3. It's between the trio of Gomez, Teixeira and the 16 year old lad who played RB vs Swindon (forget his name at the moment) I thought he was outstanding for a 16 year old.

4. I'd like to loan out Teixeira, but only to a premier league team and on a short loan, he could prove useful to us throughout the season, or maybe we could play him in the early cup games then loan him out?
That 16 year old rb could be loaned out, and I think Ojo is going out on loan already?

It's dumb to think about land in the country in terms of all space and try to divide it equally between everyone. Nearly three quarters of the country is taken up by farm land. So is that what you mean? That farmers are an elite and privileged class? If so, you're more deluded than I thought


&gt;But basically 21% of the population own a house,

How can you seriously be this fucking thick?

No, what it says is that for every 100 people in the UK there is 21 resident owned properties. You're correct there. But I think you miss the really simple fact that people do not all live alone in houses. There are such things as ""families"" whereby multiple people that are genetically or emotionally related share a single property as their place of residence. 

The modal number of bedrooms per house in the UK is 3. Three quarters of resident owned houses have 3 or more bedrooms.

People often bring up Henderson as a story of a player who persevered and made it, and it's a great one but sets unrealistic expectations of how often this really happens. 

Liverpool is a traditionally working class club and stories like this make us proud to be supporters and I get that. But so was United, and they are not the sort of club anymore that can afford to wait around for players to come good to remain competitive. There's always a balance to business and soul, and that's a separate discussion but we have to accept that we must remain competitive (not at all costs though, and FSG are, so far, very good guardians of this balance). 

United have less financial constraint though and greater recent success, so they can spend to bring in proven quality. We *do* spend a lot of money to bring in players too though, but we certainly can't afford to wait on every single player we bring in, especially those for £20m or more. 

Ultimately those legends won things, and that's what matters. That's why the discussion has to eventually be about what makes the team better, not how to fit in Lucas or why we must have a DM. The mythical DM might be the answer, but I feel we are not asking other questions because it *has to be the DM.*

As I wrote, I love Lucas. But I am not suggesting we sell him right away or throw him into the reserves - only that we assess if he is the right player *if we want to play a DM* and *if we should even be thinking about the DM as the only, obvious solution.*",null,0,null,1438621277,null,null,1438622744,0,ctq283a,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,t1_ctq1qqf,null,null,null,1440256391,null,5,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

As for the height part, it was a big worry for me when I first went up, but I found that worry quickly disappeared when you get up there. If you've ever had the window seat on an airliner then it's very similar to that, but you feel a lot less cramped as you have a clear canopy above you rather than a tiny window next to you.

If you haven't been on an airliner then the first 1,000ft is when you will really notice the difference. After that the sensation tails off and the higher you get, the less you notice it really. A good way to stop concentrating on the height is to fly the glider yourself. You'll quickly forget everything else that's happening when you're concentrating on trying to make a nice steady turn, or to even just flying in a straight line!

Not flown and aerotow before so I can't help you there, all I know is that it is a lot less dramatic than being winch launched.

null,null,Outron,logo,,null,"Here's a fairly good article, explaining the Aguero moment in image rights terms: http://www.postmatch.org/251/ronaldo-beckham-aguero-football-image-rights/

&gt;As he runs towards the crowd barriers there are large groups of camera men lined up and down the sideline who all take numerous photos of him – dozens of camera shutters clicking open and closed many times a second. That image of Aguero running down the sideline will be captured hundreds of times and relayed all the way around the world for months and years to come. It will grace the covers of newspapers, magazines, DVD’s, billboards, on the side of busses, in train stations – everywhere.

&gt;It will also be used in other campaigns that form a major part of international sports – to market the products produced by sponsors. Aguero has sponsors like Puma that pay him a lot of money (£5M for 3 years), so how do Manchester City, the Premier League, television stations, newspapers and other sponsors use the image of his goal celebration for free while some sponsors pay good money for the same rights? The short answer is that he is paid for all use of his image rights in the same way sponsors pay him. His club pay him an additional fee on top of his salary that includes all of these uses, while the topic is broad and complicated, it is often referred to as “image rights”.

&gt;In common law juristictions an image right is defined as a property owned and controlled by a person. It is the right of a person to own, control and administer his or her own image. Image rights for a person are similar to what a trademark is for a logo or name, or a copyright for an artistic work. In the same way that you can’t violate the copyright by claiming a movie or song as your own, with image rights you can’t claim an endorsement or ownership of a persons image without their permission.

Yes, a team above us could have a hiorrible season, for whatever reason, that means we finish above them. How do you measure this now ?

3 months ago I never even considered that Sterling would be worth £50M. How much is Ibe worth ? How do you factor that in without pulling numbers out of the air ?

I'm not saying his analysis or methodology is perfect. But I'm not sure how you can objectively analyse the as it is now.

The TPI index and the £XI seem a reasonable starting point. Until the market speaks and we find out that the 600K we paid for Sterling is now £50m, we don't know and anything else is specualtion. Of course, what Tomkins writes is also speculation but it as at least based on some data and doesn't seem to be complete BS.

&gt;I'm not saying that gets us into the ""Title Zone,"" 
Aye, the purchase value / wage bill of the players we have is different to what they would be if sold to another club today (and that could be up or down ofc). But that hasn't happened so the current purchase value &amp; wage is what this analysis is based on.

null,null,Tinie_Snipah,eng-hertfordshire,Montreal / Herts,null,"&gt;0.6% of the population of Britain owns 50% of the land – very much a small, privileged elite.

And they're farmers. They aren't ""privileged"" or ""elite"". They own a lot of land, yes, but they have to work that land all year round to make a living. It's a seriously hard way of life and is extremely cut throat. If you think that simply owning land makes you rich and powerful then you're deluded. A lot of farm land isn't suitable for housing, either due to the geography of where it is situated or the huge cost it'd take to turn empty fields into a brand new town. But that's not to say it doesn't happen. It sure as fuck does. But simply owning land does not make you rich or powerful.

&gt;not only will you pay no tax on its appreciating value

source

&gt;but you'll be able to benefit from numerous agricultural subsidies to enrich you further.

This is a common myth. Two thirds of farmers in the country get less than £5,000 / year in subsidies. If they do nothing then they get no money. A lot of sectors get no money at all.

But even this is misleading as most subsidies don't do much to actually help out the farmer but to keep prices low they benefit the big companies that buy and sell food to the masses.

Pig farmers, poultry farmers and vegetable farmers receive no subsidies at all.

True, some farmers make a nice profit out of the system by playing it, but they are not the majority and they do not live an easy, ""elite"" lifestyle. Most farmers do not want the subsidies because it is a shitty system. They want to get proper pay for their produce, but that would mean a slight decrease in corporate profits, and we can't have that now can we!",null,0,null,1438622436,null,null,false,0,ctq2zpf,null,t3_3fjxee,null,null,null,t1_ctq25rv,null,null,null,1440256817,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

When Lucas plays, you know you've a safeguard there should we lose the ball and perhaps the other team starts to break. That confidence of having someone like Lucas there to cover really gives Henderson / Can / Milner / Allen the license to go forward and either dictate the game or start to look for chinks in the oppositions armor. 

I can't agree with your opinion that Lucas is only above average, sure he hasn't been the same since his injury in the 11/12 season  ( If I recall correctly ) but he does a really solid job. He gets it , moves it on fairly quickly albeit basically. Should we need someone with a bit more tempo and rhythm to his passing , we have Joe Allen for that. Lucas does his job well and I prefer him to start in a midfield 3 to allow the other two to play to their strengths.

We are unfortunate as his position is seen as vital to some people of course, but who exactly is available on the market to come in and do his job better than him for a reasonable fee?

**Original Post:**          
It is with great sadness that I have decided to part with my Asus PB287Q. Monitor is in great working condition with no marks or dead pixels, very well looked after.  
Price: £275  
Delivery: Collection only (Newcastle-Upon-Tyne). Due to very large fee that would be required to ship the Monitor safely.

I get all those caveats, and if the CS rep explained them I would have been far less irritated.

Good points re: the router ownership. In the past I've never experienced VM caring about returning them and such, but maybe that's changed.

That still doesn't explain the experience I had 2 years ago when I moved house and took my router with me and they still had to deliver a new one... the CS rep in that circumstance went to great lengths to make up technogibberish reasons why routers were apparently tied to particular houses.

null,null,Zylias2,null,null,null," 1 - I think the squad as of whole has looked better. We didn't have the most challenging pre - season so it's hard to gauge, but I was happy with the performances of all the "" young "" players. Teixeira will probably get the most recognition, but I don't see him making the grade here just yet unless he improves massively, Suso was way ahead of him by the time he broke into the first team and Teixeira is 22 now, his make or break season.

2 - Gomez definitely, I'd love to see him start vs Stoke. So composed, physically strong yet agile , quick and good on the ball. I liked the look of Benteke vs Swindon as well, he looks rearing to go. Milner , Ings and Origi have looked really good to but the latter needs to work on his movement and finishing so hopefully that gets better.

3 - Ibe definitely. He has it all. He's super quick , great stature as well. Hopefully he just adds that little bit more quality to his final product and we'll have a star on our hands. Good people around him and a sensible head on his shoulders too which is a bonus.

4 - Most likely Ojo. I don't want to say Teixeria because he should be at least making the bench here. Ojo definitely needs to go out to a top championship side and show what he's made of. 

5 - Our defense is just below top 4 quality in my opinion and about on par with Spurs. Clyne was a big addition for us but we need cover in front of them so hopefully Lucas plays. No it's not Lovren's fault either. People seem to forget that the goal we let in that everyone flamed Lovren for was Skrtels man running off him and beating Lovren with pace and shot early. I'd love to see Sakho / Lovren play together but I think we're okay with a Sakho/Skrtel team. Moreno needs to improve defensively, and actually work on closing his man down in the box or show him to the outside rather than stand there and plant his feet like he did against Arsenal for Bellerins goal and yesterdays goal for Swindon.

6 - Our Achilles heel from what I've seen from this pre-season was we need to be a little bit sharper. Also, would like for people to actually watch Adam Lallana before raging for him to be a starter. He doesn't cut it for me, he dribbles into trouble far too often and lacks the pace to play on the flanks. He could be useful for big games in a Willian type role where he covers a side and helps defensively but I don't think he's good enough for a LW/RW or even a no.10 role with Coutinho and Firmino there.

You don't pull a taser when you have a person running at you with a knife...If it doesn't work you're dead. Those aren't risks you're expected to take to save the life of an armed criminal.

American cops can't learn much from British cops, because we work in two different worlds. I walk into houses, and stop vehicles all day with almost no fear. The same can't be said in a country where literally anybody could be armed, and they can end your life with the squeeze of a trigger.

Really the only thing I think US police need to do is to reduce the number of Police organisations they have, it's outrageous, and have something akin to a national standard for recruitment. At the moment, they have small organisations who recruit some absolute fucking nutcases with pretty much no oversight.

null,null,astonv,,Villa Till I Die,null,"I'll give you a 40,000 foot flyover of transfers that have come in and players sold/loaned out. As you may have heard, it's been quite a summer for Villa fans...Players coming in: Scott Sinclair, a left winger, came in on a permanent at the end of the season for 3.5 mil (all the numbers I'm using are Euros btw) from City after a fairly good loan spell here in 14/15. Just scored a hatty against Nottingham in a preseason friendly, so hopes are up for him this year. Micah Richards, a RB/CB, who has been given the captain's band in each preseason game, came in from City as well on a free transfer after a loan spell at Fiorentina. He will be playing CB in place of the injured Okore who will be back in September, and we will see how then Tim deals with his return tactically.The previous captain was He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, otherwise known as the ""Snake"". But actually, the previous captain was Delph who went to City in an utterly ridiculous series of events (look it up and you'll see what I mean if you didn't see already). Mark Bunn, a GK, came on a free transfer from Norwich to fill in the backup GK role behind Guzan that Shay Given vacated. Idrissa Gueye, a CM and very much a box-to-box player, came in for 12.5 mil from Lille in Ligue 1 (you'll notice a trend as you keep reading). He has superb athleticism and energy, and I am excited to see how he can affect play this year. Jordan Amavi, a LB and a very highly touted young prospect, came in from Nice in Ligue 1 for 7.7 mil. He is one of the most exciting transfers in Villa's recent history as we have struggled at the LB spot as of late. He is highly rated, promising (only 22 years old), loves to go forward at pace and use skill, will work back to defend, and is a fantastic athlete. He is the transfer that many Villa fans are most thrilled about. Jordan Ayew, a CF, came in from Lorient in Ligue 1 for 12 mil. With the departure of Benteke for 32.5 mil, Sherwood had some cash to splash around and, in my opinion, it worked against us here. 12 mil is a bit pricy for the unproven younger brother of Andre Ayew, but at 23 years old, he still has plenty of room to grow, so I am optimistic about Tim bringing him to form. In addition, he held out with his former club, and actually went rogue for a few days, solely because he wanted to come here, so I see it as a positive that he genuinely wants to be playing at Villa. Jose Angel Crespo, a CB/RB, came in from Cordoba for a fee of 1 mil. Most see Crespo as a backup, as he is 28 and is not a big time signing, however as the season progresses with injuries, tired legs, etc., he may prove to be an important piece of the Villa puzzle. Rudy Gestede, a CF, came in from Blackburn Rovers for 8.5 mil just a few days ago. He is a huge body (6' 4""), and scored more header goals in the last two seasons than anyone else in the top four leagues of English soccer. I am really looking forward to he, and Kozak (another big-bodied forward), banging plenty of goals into the back of the net this year. Our latest signing is Jordan Veretout, a CM, from...you guessed it, Ligue 1 (Nantes to be precise) for 9.9 mil. Another youngster, at 22, he is extremely promising and, along with Amavi, is a player with a high ceiling for growth. He is a set piece specialist, and makes key passes through the midfield. In 36 games, he scored 7 goals, so he may provide that extra spark from the midfield Villa have lacked. Personally, he is the signing I am most excited about as I think he could be a future club captain if he sticks around and improves to his potential level.

On the flip side, players we've sold include Benteke, Delph, Given, Luna, Sylla, Lowton, Wiemann, Bent, and Cleverley (back from loan here in 14/15 season).

This is the first time in years I have been optimistic heading into a season, and I hope the team will perform. It's a great time to be a Villa fan, and anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't realize the quality of the window we've had thus far. That being said, we have to be realistic and understand that forming a successful team will be a process and trust that Sherwood will follow through in the long-term, rather than berate him if the first part of the season doesn't go well.

None of the statistics suggest that Lucas is *not* an above average player. In fact, he's below average on some accounts for a holding midfielder or a defensive midfielder. You can blame some of the tactics for that, but given the way we play, can we afford to carry a player who *only* contributes defensively? 

And it's not like we completely stop leaking goals when he plays. It happens even with the solidity he provides so is the sacrifice to going forward worth it? And if it is, is *he* the right player to sacrifice it for?

EDIT: I'm only asking to challenge your opinion - I know it's an opinion, but there are a lot of ""mythical"" terms like fluidity, discipline, reading, tempo, rhythm, which don't mean a whole lot other than to the observer or unless it is completely missing. How do we compare Lucas' reading of the game vs Allen's?

**Original Post:**          
It is with great sadness that I have decided to part with my Asus PB287Q. Monitor is in great working condition with no marks or dead pixels, very well looked after.
Price: £300
Delivery: Collection only (Newcastle-Upon-Tyne). Due to very large fee that would be required to ship the Monitor safely.

I see him signal to other players to cover when he goes in and tries to break up a counter-attack. Or when he tries to anticipate an opponents pass and tries to step in, he looks over his should to see where the runners or our defenders are (In some instances he doesn't have the speed to get to the attacker in time - this could be that he hasn't adjusted to his slower speed or the toll the injuries has had on him yet).

I'm not saying he is world class, he's the best we have now and I FEEL more comfortable and confident in our defense when he is on the field, especially since our full backs like to get forward and Skrtel likes to make tackles that take him out of the game.

Those are just words. He's not the ""safeguard"" that you might think, and we know nothing of the ""confidence"" he gives Henderson when playing together. 

&gt;I can't agree with your opinion that Lucas is only above average, sure he hasn't been the same since his injury in the 11/12 season ( If I recall correctly ) but he does a really solid job. He gets it , moves it on fairly quickly albeit basically. 

He's saying Lucas is decent/good at passing. You're contradicting op while agreeing with him and avoiding the real problems.

&gt; That confidence of having someone like Lucas there to cover really gives Henderson / Can / Milner / Allen the license to go forward and either dictate the game... Lucas does his job well and I prefer him to start in a midfield 3 to allow the other two to play to their strengths.

&gt;A watchdog occupying a middle ground and shying away from controversial findings seems to me to be somewhat oxymoronic. Many have blamed the IPCC’s culture based on deference to the police on the fact that former police officers account for a large proportion of its 400-odd staff. According to a Panorama made by Mark Daly last year, **8 out of 9 IPCC senior investigators and just under half of their deputies are former police**.  This being the case, the IPCC’s impartiality is clearly questionable.

&gt;As human rights lawyer Jules Carey, of Tuckers, puts it:

&gt;‘When you look at the number of ex-police officers working there you do sometimes wonder if their canteen feels like a police canteen. It’s almost like an old boys’ club.’

They also mention:

&gt;Since the IPCC’s inception almost nine years ago, there have been more than 250 deaths in police custody.  No police officer has ever been convicted for causing such a death.

Thats fishy. I mean, they could have all died of drug overdoses, but how likely is that?

This is an episode of Panorama about the IPCC and its questionable impartiality of the IPCC. Very interesting and worth a watch:

Plus their first team average age is fairly young, so there is little chance of any of their young stars being given a chance.

So because of this, Barca have decided to sell off all their young stars but include a buy back clause into every deal (as they did when they sold Deulofeu to Everton recently). This effectively means that other teams will do all the hard work in making their youth team players into first team regulars, then Barca can buy back the best of the bunch at a discounted price. It's practically a loan deal as all the perks are in Barca's favour.

Personally, I think it's outrageous and I hope all teams across Europe reject the buy back clause as it just seems to be another way for a major giant of world football to control the transfer market and work it in their favour.",null,0,null,1438625893,null,null,false,0,ctq5d4l,null,t3_3fn462,null,null,null,t3_3fn462,null,null,null,1440257936,null,45,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,45,null

The British army as I said before were there to destroy the IRA, not build a peace process. So believe it or not the IRA weren't just 'we love bombing people Tiocfaidh ár lá yeooo"" kind of organisation, there was a just cause that they were fighting for, and the British army admitted they lost to the IRA on a strategic and military level and therefore the IRA won Catholics their civil rights, got all their prisoners out of jail (which is a recognition of political status), won a referendum *to allow the North to leave British rule*, got shared power so Sinn Fein could enter mainstream politics and got the British army out of Ireland. Yes I would say they got its goal seeing as the one thing they didn't achieve, a United Ireland, was given a platform to be achieved and is currently in the process. 


I don't 'love' the IRA, I'm fully aware of what the IRA have done. I do sympathise with their cause however. That's all.

The conspiracy, said the resemble the Mafia in its organisation and strength, includes well-placed and influential professional people and its tentacles reach into Westminster and Whitehall, police suspect.""

From the signals coming from Auchenowie it does seem like things are progressing well.  

On the Rangers website, there is an [article](http://rangers.co.uk/news/headlines/item/9761-five-minute-dip-unacceptable) on Mark Warburton being critical over a five minute dip in intensity at training. 

I'm really excited by that level of scrutiny and it seems that the standards and quality of training seems to have improved immeasurably since last season.

&gt;  Was it the same sort of football against the Hibs?

Against Hibs, we didn't really get started until after 40 minutes but we were pretty comfortable after that.

We were slightly weaker at the back but that's partially down to Hibs giving us more of a test.

Last week we also made a couple of dodgy passes to the goalies weaker foot but the communication seems to have improved this week.

The biggest criticism over the two weeks is the poor conversion rate of the chances we have been creating -- we've scored 9 goals, but it could easily have been more. I'm sure they will be working to address that.

It's encouraging to see how well we seemed to have transformed our style of play into a high intensity attacking game. I'm particularly impressed at the use of substitutions.

Now I admire Levy as a negotiator but his need to seemingly wait to the end of transfer windows before he makes his big moves puzzles me. This as a result you go into seasons still bedding in players who don't really then start to gel until 8 games in. The late business also means because you tend to buy established players you often pay over the odds during the scramble Berihino may be one example. (Villa don't worry about that we just buy OAP's on frees and players nobody wants on deadline day so there cheaper).

You change your will as needed. You can make hundreds of wills, the latest is the one that will be used in your death. Keep them safe, and make sure SOMEONE is aware where it is. If you want to pay for it, keep it at a solicitors. 

I would say its very stupid not to have a will, doesn't matter if you are single or married or with or without children. So many people do not have wills.

Sort of what has actually happened in Lucas' case. Remember, Rafa brought him not for his defensive capabilities, but to go forward and create chances. His injuries and the depth we had at the position when he arrived pushed him back. There was no way he was going to be more useful going forward than Gerrard or Alonso.

We should avoid making the same mistake with Henderson. I've said it before and I'll keep saying it; Henderson was at his best (brilliant best if I may) when Gerrard was not on the pitch and he was relied upon to create chances and pick out difficult passes. His defensive abilities are more useful further up the pitch than they would be shielding the back four, and diminishing his offensive out put.

I'm no legal expert (and I echo the other commenters that you go see one, i.e. a solicitor with property dispute experience, at your earliest convenience) but it surely is impossible for N to legally sell your son's half of the house without consulting him/getting his signature on the contract etc.

Edinburgh is a car-hostile city -- it predates the automobile by a few centuries and the center (the posh bit: the crappy run-down slums are all on the outskirts) is small enough to be walkable. Also, the predominant form of parking is on-street (most dwellings predate the automobile hence have to parking garages) so parked cars are typically overlooked by many, many windows, which makes un-observed car theft or vandalism really difficult. 

So you don't generally get car theft hereabouts because someone needs to get somewhere in a hurry. What you get is kids joyriding (in which case they're probably ripping off a dirt bike instead), or professional car thieves lifting a posh motor to order and stripping/exporting it.

It seems to potentially fit the following penalty clause criteria:

* ""The sum may be a penalty if it is ‘extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss which could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach’. "" 


* ""A provision may not be a penalty if it can be commercially justified and provided that its predominant purpose is to compensate loss and not to deter breach""


I did bring up the quality of training during the training as an issue - but by that time it was too late to leave as my 14 day ""payment-free"" period was over.

The point I was making by the fact they charged more than they paid me is that they profited from me greatly over the past 1 year 8 months, and so I did not cause any financial loss to them, which makes it more likely to be a penalty clause.

The most obvious is just how good is Lucas? In your post you seem to waver back and forth, understandably so. He does some things like tackling remarkably well, but others, like winning duels, notably poorly. The key to a great DM is consistency for me, and Lucas seems to have reached his peak. He will not suddenly turn into Busquets or Matic this season. For one reason, his body doesn't seem to be durable enough to handle a seasons worth of hard DM football. Moving on from that I think you hit the nail on the head. We had a great run against poor quality opposition with Lucas in the squad last year. Two things also happened during some of our on form runs: Migs regained his net, and Gerrard was injured. This does not mean that Mingolet was solely responsible for the wins, or the absence of Gerrard made us much better. The same can be said about Lucas. My sensibility tells me that yes, he surely contributed to the runs of good form, but he was not essential to them.

I've also wavered in supporting Lucas and wanting him sold. Stats aside, I personally feel he's too much of an injury liability to be counted on. I would be shocked if he played over 25 games for us this year.",null,0,null,1438628975,null,null,false,0,ctq7h1p,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,1440258929,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,null,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,null,"First off, this is an interesting, thoughtful post that you clearly spent some time on. Thanks--it makes the sub better.

But, a couple of things:

* I'm not sure it's been said that Lucas is a great reader of the game. There are players who play this way--like Alonso--and there are top tacklers who don't focus on reading the game, and getting interceptions, and just focus on when they can put a tackle in and win the ball back. Lucas is the latter, and he always has been. His tackling stats over the last few season have been superb.

* It's important to point out that Liverpool's system of playing out of the back should have nothing to do with takeons. Lucas isn't expected, intended, or really preferred to dribble around players who are pressing. And then it should be mentioned that he has 2 successful takeons from last year, and a success rate of 66.67%. That means he only attempted 3 takeons and he was successful in two of them. Hardly a negative point for him as a player, is it? Liverpool *pass* out of the back--they do not Bo Jackson Tecmo Bowl their way across the halfway line.

* Lastly, I think it's important to understand Lucas's role and not judge him negatively because of it. He is not in the side to do it all, or he would be in the side more often. Henderson is our box-to-box guy--Lucas is there to win the ball and keep  possession, period. While you're right that maybe Liverpool should have a top box-to-box player like Matic, I'd argue that we already do in Henderson (who has numbers very similar to Matic's, just with a more offensive slant, while Matic is more defensive slanted). Lucas is a specialist there to provide cover when we have a system that his play suits itself to. I don't think we'll see a huge amount of him this year with the addition of players like Milner and Firmino (who can add a lot defensively and offensively) and the emergence of Can.

The idea being that secret courts can overrule the democratically elected and legitimate governments of any country if the legislation they pass is any sort of threat to the interests of capital.

So let's say a government gets elected with a mandate to increase taxes on cigarettes. Then the tobacco companies would sue the government for their losses, or depending on the outcome of the legal decision made (which would be in secret as far as I understand it) overrule the bill. It doesn't matter who you vote for, the decisions about legislation would be made elsewhere by people who aren't elected, aren't accountable to the general public, and who make rulings according to what they feel is in the best interests of business.

It's part of a much broader campaign to insulate the market from democracy, so that no matter who you vote for the private sector can rely upon nothing impeding their ability to make money. It's part of the same thing which has seen Barnet council outsource all of it's services to the private sector - so now Capita runs the council's no matter who you vote for, and since Capita is a private sector company the details about their decision making are a matter of corporate confidentiality. It's the same principle as the Eurogroup, which is a an ad-hoc body with no legal basis, no minutes, no elections or accoutability, being in a position to veto all bill put before the Greek government. No matter who they vote for now, the Eurogroup decides which policy they can or cannot present before parliament. 


See [this](http://newleftreview.org/II/87/wolfgang-streeck-how-will-capitalism-end) 2014 piece by the economist Wolfgang Streeck:

&gt;Capitalism and democracy had long been considered adversaries, until the postwar settlement seemed to have accomplished their reconciliation. Well into the twentieth century, owners of capital had been afraid of democratic majorities abolishing private property, while workers and their organizations expected capitalists to finance a return to authoritarian rule in defence of their privileges. Only in the Cold War world did capitalism and democracy seem to become aligned with one another, as economic progress made it possible for working-class majorities to accept a free-market, private-property regime, in turn making it appear that democratic freedom was inseparable from, and indeed depended on, the freedom of markets and profit-making. Today, however, doubts about the compatibility of a capitalist economy with a democratic polity have powerfully returned. Among ordinary people, there is now a pervasive sense that politics can no longer make a difference in their lives, as reflected in common perceptions of deadlock, incompetence and corruption among what seems an increasingly self-contained and self-serving political class, united in their claim that ‘there is no alternative’ to them and their policies. One result is declining electoral turnout combined with high voter volatility, producing ever greater electoral fragmentation, due to the rise of ‘populist’ protest parties, and pervasive government instability.

And from his book *the delayed crisis of democratic capitalism*

&gt;The market could be made immune from democratic correctives either through the neoliberal re-education of citizens or through the elimination of democracy on the model of 1970s Chile; the first involves an attempt to indoctrinate the public in standard economic theory, while the second is not available as things stand at present. A strategy to dispel the tension between capitalism and democracy, and to establish the long-term primacy of the market over politics, must therefore centre on incremental ‘reforms’ of political-economic institutions:29 the move towards a rule-bound economic policy, independent central banks and a fiscal policy safe from electoral outcomes; the transfer of economic policy decisions to regulatory bodies and ‘committees of experts’; and debt ceilings enshrined in the constitution that are legally binding on governments for decades to come, if not forever. In the course of this, the states of advanced capitalism are to be constructed in such a way that they earn the enduring trust of the owners and movers of capital, by giving credible guarantees at the level of policy and institutions that they will not intervene in ‘the economy’ – or that, if they do, it will only be to protect and enforce market justice in the shape of suitable returns on capital investments. A precondition for this is the neutralization of democracy, in the sense of the social democracy of postwar capitalism, and the successful completion of a programme of Hayekian liberalization.

Having Gerrard as a regista was nice but I honestly think Suarez was the key that season and to a lesser extent Sterling and Sturridge.  Gerrard did probably help them flourish in an attacking sense but they excelled early in the season without him there as well.  

As for the alternatives, Allen is serviceable but too lightweight and really doesn't contribute much more than Lucas in attack.  I think I'll have a heart attack if Can starts there.  He has no positional disciple and will leave our back four exposed all game while forcing our other attack minded players to track back more.  He's overly dependent on his physical tools.  I don't think I've seen us play a single good game with a double pivot either.

If we started Lucas in the holding role against Chelsea two seasons ago and played for the draw, which was all we needed, we might have been champions.  Which highlights the real source of our defensive woes which are in my opinion Rodger's tactics.  He seems fairly naive and more than willing to give the opposing team all the space they want in return for more bodies in the other teams half.  Other teams also generally have an idea of how his teams will set up so they have plenty of time to identify potential weaknesses in our side.

Op addresses whether or not Lucas was actually a key component to that run and the answer is unclear.

My opinion is that Lucas isn't a ""vital"" part to our team. The issue of our defense hasn't fully been solved by Lucas (read all of OP's post, seriously), and if a fan on reddit could think of a realistic solution to our defense then I suspect a team of professional coaches could as well. It's a tricky thing and I believe it's more on tactics then personnel.

Regardless, the team needs to bring in another DM/holding mid/whatever within the next season for two as a replacement for Lucas down the road.

null,null,FeepingCreature,null,null,null,"No yeah, definitely. Saying it's a spectrum doesn't mean you're any ""less male"", like people are trying to exclude you from maleness, it's like... you can draw the line way big, and say there's a really sharp border in the middle where you have two really androgynous twins but one watches football and the other watches ballet, so one is like #masculine and the other is #sofemme, and that's obviously silly... on the other hand you have people who are like ""dude, I don't watch romcoms, that's _for girls_"", and you want to be like, ""hey, it's okay, I'm not questioning your guyness"", and you sort of wish he'd explore around more without being afraid of being branded ""not 100% guy"". I get that that's like an attack, but what I'm saying is, nobody wants to take your label away. Absolutely nobody wants to do that. That'd be horrible.

But also we have to be able to talk about the fact that there's ""guy things"" and ""girl things"" maybe, in a stereotypical way, and some people are comfortable sort of straddling the line, and some people are just ... totally naturally uninterested in anything girly, and most people enjoy some stuff from the other side of the nonexistent fence. And most people enjoy some stuff that's sort of .. borderline? Lots of girls like pro wrestling, and lots of guys like cooking and cleaning. And there's a whole _universe_ of stuff that people consider manly and girly and people aren't _points_, they're _clouds_ or _balls_ of various definition and sharpness, or totally weird sets that don't even have to be connected. And I guess you could just average it up and call that a spectrum, but I feel that does undersell the diversity at work. Like, there _is_ a spectrum and you _can_ sort of average people, but it has to be understood that there's necessarily an enormous loss going on in a classification like that. It'd be like looking at purses and saying ""you're 100% coin"" and ""you're 100% paper money"" and people would go like ""dude, I'm 100% paper, I don't know what you're talking about, $1 pieces are basically paper anyways, lots of paper guys have $1 pieces"" and I want to be like, ""hey, it's okay ... nobody wants to attack your paperness""

I guess what I'm saying is it's a wild and complicated social universe, and nobody can be reduced to a single point on some scale, _even if there is a scale_, and I wish people wouldn't have to be defensive about their classification. I wish people wouldn't be worried about their average position on the scale so much. I wish we could just say what we like without having to be afraid somebody's going to take our guy card away.

I blame the language for this. You can be like ""yeah I like ballet and naked firemen and sometimes I wish I had breasts. 100% guy"" and brains, like, all brains are _weird as fuck_, right, so this is totally something that can _make sense from the inside_, and there is a sense in which the inside is all there is, but I sorta wish I could say ""are you sure"" in a sense of ... I wish I could sort of split this up, maybe along a few more dimensions, and be able to say like ""yeah so you're a sex/romantic expression femme cluster _guy_, nbd"", but that's not actually a thing. And so I want to say, reflexively, ""are you sure you're not girly"", and that's an _attack_, and I don't _want_ it to be an attack. Why are there not words. Like, why is English not so like you can say ""yeah I'm a social!guy ident!guy stereo!girly!60%"" but not super awkward. Is there a subtext for this? Is there a handbook for the subtext? Can we standardize? _Please_? This is hard.

(Oh btw, if you keep editing a post, occasionally Reddit throws away a bunch of stuff you've written. This is not okay, Reddit. Always refresh the page after every edit.)

Like, you see it in this thread, people are like ""hey, everybody expresses themselves with a varied mix of interests on the gender spectrum"" and people are like ""oy, don't be rude, I fully identify as a guy"", and they're not even disagreeing. Like, they _can't_ even be disagreeing, because they're not _communicating_ in the first place, and I feel with the limited wordset that standard English gives us there really wasn't any way they _could_ have expected to communicate about this. And that sucks. And I don't know how to fix it.

I don't know. Maybe we need to learn that [everything about gender is complicated](https://xkcd.com/592/). Maybe we need to teach that in school somehow. I don't know how you'd do it without being preachy? Humans like their sharply delineated ingroups, and I don't even want to _take_ that from them, like, that's undeniably a _human-y thing_ to do.

As I mentioned previously, this is from the British army themselves

.


&gt; Lol you think catholis got civil rights in the 90s? Lol. Try the 70s. 


When PIRA activity started out they didn't and the British Army didn't care, the GFA agreement in the 90s was a topping off, it was still something the IRA fought for and won, which I believe is the topic at hand?


The rest of what you said was mindless garbage, what ever you want to link or joke about go ahead, and apart from that your points don't say anything. Make sure to say liked the IRA? What? 

The Nazi analogy was also pretty dumb. Seeing as the Jews were the cause so to speak this would only be relevant if I didn't approve of the IRA's aims? The much better analogy was the one I said. I sympathise with the IRA the same way Brits sympathise with World War II soldiers, I sympathise with the IRA's cause the same way Brits sympathise with the British army's cause, but I don't agree with killing innocent civilians the way both the IRA and the British army did


&gt; One of the IRAs main strategies was killing civilians


Well that's just untrue. The IRA would phone in warnings about the bombs they placed. Only 35% of the IRA's victims were civilians, compared to 50% by the British army and 85% by loyalist paramilitaries. The IRA for the most part was a war against the state. Almost all of the IRA's civilian killings came from innocent victims when attacking legitimate targets or tit for tat killings with loyalist paramilitaries.

Damien pls. Theres no evidence of this whatsoever. This shows your naivety. The SDLP told its supporters to ignore it and they did. 

&gt;Australia aren't independent, Africa never won independence it was agreed on upon by the British to introduce democracy until they lost interest, and as for India I never said the Brits couldn't be forced out, but if you wanted to leave the Brits wouldn't just let you. The IRA forced them out of the 26, Washington forced them out of America. I think you missed the point

Another example of ignorance. Labour dismantled the empire in the 60s. The Brits did let people leave.


&gt;When PIRA activity started out they didn't and the British Army didn't care, the GFA agreement in the 90s was a topping off, it was still something the IRA fought for and won, which I believe is the topic at hand?


Extra 20 year of chaos and murder for the craic.


&gt;Well that's just untrue. The IRA would phone in warnings about the bombs they placed


This meme again. If the IRA cared about civilians it wouldn't of planted the bombs in the first place.

Common sense isn't your strong point is it. I made it pretty clear that the SDLP told people to ignore the referendum and they did. Everyone had a chance to vote. People stopped themselves because of what the SDLP said, not the invisible loyalists that no evidence exists on.  

So ""The army was trying to create peace between both sides"" is the same as ""but then proclaiming to be a pillar of morality and justice is another"" I don't think so. 



&gt;Northern Ireland was created through gerrymandering to maintain British control of the Island (which if held today would be totally illegal but we'll ignore that fam) and the army was sent in with the intentions of retaining control and the status quo on the Island. Obviously they wouldn't have minded peace, but it would have been a happy accident rather than the reason for them being there.

There's a ton of mixed families coming up whose kids aren't raised on religion. Thus their political beliefs are based on sense rather than their parent's views. And if they think they are better off in the union (as far as I know they are) they will technically be UNIONISTS. 

The same can't be said for Protestant nationalists. If a UI is better for us one would have to do a fair amount of research to figure that out. And I think being in the UK is better off regardless. This means that since their views are based on sense they will opt to be unionists. 

As someone currently growing up through secondary school where there are a LOT of mixed students and students from other cultures, most recognise that being in the union benefits them in many ways.

Just because it achieved one thing doesn't mean it was enough? The British army post-1980 were there to fight the IRA, of course the IRA would fight back.


&gt; This meme again. If the IRA cared about civilians it wouldn't of planted the bombs in the first place.


They wanted to disrupt the functioning of the North by disrupting commerce and business, and making Northern Ireland as a state economically non-viable. I thought everyone knew this, were you not taught this in school? They phoned in warnings so as few as possible civilians were killed in the process.


&gt; Damien you're making me sick mate. Go to church or something. Legitimate targets. christ

null,null,L41r,null,null,null,"&gt; If by ""gender identity"" you mean personal preference for certain activities, such as lifting at the gym or sewing, then sure that's non binary, but I see no reason why that should affect what constitutes gender. 

By gender identity I do not mean adherence to traditional gender roles. The former is by no means predicated on or defined by the latter. By gender identity I mean someone's self-concept of their gender – something which has been demonstrated by study after study to be the result of a neurological structure. Behaviour is mutable, but basic brain structure isn't (well, not to any meaningful degree yet).

&gt; There is also evidence that says that what you call gender dysphoria is just a subclass of body dysmorphic disorder; a recognized medical condition that also encompasses issues such as anorexia.

First of all, it's not 'what I call' gender dysphoria, it's 'what the overwhelming majority of the medical community calls' gender dysphoria. Also, if you can find one up-to-date study from a reputable organisation that doesn't have *severe* methodology flaws and hasn't been thoroughly debunked which backs up your claim, I will be incredibly surprised, as the general scientific consensus is contrary to that, and common sense dictates that such claims are ridiculous. Namely, Body Dysmorphic Disorder is fundamentally an anxiety disorder, and as a result, the symptoms of it can be reduced or completely cured with psychotherapy and SSRIs. Gender Dysphoria cannot be treated similarly – as we've found time and time again and with study after study. If Gender Dysphoria were a subset of BDD, then SSRIs and psychotherapy *would* be an effective treatment for it and transitioning would only exacerbate symptoms. Instead, we've found the opposite to be the case.

&gt;As far as I am concerned, the notion of gender identity is total bunk.

[I'll let NDT tackle this one.](https://youtu.be/yRxx8pen6JY?t=9s)

&gt; As for CAIS, in a binary worldview they would be women. This very rare condition is generally caused by a mutation in the y chromosome that contains patterns for the protiens that respond to androgen steroids are mutated and do not function.
Using miniscule populations of individuals with genetic disorders is not satisfactory reason to discount a social construct.


First, here's an interesting fact: Gender Dysphoria is far more prevalent for the population of people with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, which is yet more proof that gender identity is an inherent neurological structure determined by androgenisation. 

Second, you were saying objective reality can be expressed by the traditional gender binary. It doesn't matter how small the population that falls outside a category is, if even one example of someone falling outside a category system exists, the category has to be revised so that nobody falls outside of it.

Can't see much else wrong with the formation, maybe Ibe for Lallana but I'm not sure between the two of them honestly.

Fair enough.

Hopefully you can understand that, without context, your comment seemed to be shutting down a fairly objective article. I see what you're saying now though, OP's posting history does seem to have quite a racist slant to it and your initial comment seems a lot more fair. To me at first, it seemed like you were painting a regular article as an extreme one in order to advance an agenda of your own.

I would still stand by my point in the context of this isolated instance, but in the context of OP's wider post history I see and accept the point you made.

I think we must be careful what to define as a ""racist agenda"". In the case of OP it is certainly present and you were quite right to condemn the post. However, I think we can all agree that in the same vein, we must be careful not to let an opposite but equally dangerous agenda rise in the form of censorship. Not commenting on this case as I think you were justified, but I guess my post was quite harsh because I'm so used to people tip-toeing around issues, as well as censoring them, when we should be openly discussing these in a constructive manner.

Thanks for the clarification.

null,null,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,null,"Oh! I was wondering how long it'd take this particular kind of sneering posturing to make it into /r/BritishPolitics. Dubious accolade for you to be the first to drag it through- anyone making anti-Corbyn comments from a non-Labour position is getting swarmed by bile like this in the other UK-centric political subreddits.

&gt;Liberal Democrats really don't like genuine left wing ideas do they?

That wasn't what I said, you clod. Corbyn's specific policies are largely Miliband with a STWC-esque slant- certain positions, like his outright offensive stance on the Falklands ""issue"", are absolutely, unequivocally *unelectable*. 

The only viable prospect I'd like to see less than another dysfunctional, authoritarian New Labour government is the present Conservative government's continuation for another decade. 

A Corbyn victory will be the greatest gift the Conservatives could have ever hoped for. They've fought against his brand of Labour before, and absolutely *destroyed* them *every single time*. Add the upcoming Boundary Review's inevitable transfer of ~30 seats from Labour directly to the Tories, and impossibility of winning a significant fraction of Scotland back within anything like a workable timeframe, and you've got a situation that would need a Blair/1997-style swing to win even a slim majority for Labour. 

Corbyn is incapable of that. Just about every single metric is weighed heavily against him. If he wins, Labour will retreat into its shell and merrily jerk themselves off inbetween patting each other on the back for ideological soundness for the next five years, and get absolutely massacred in the South- all the cards are in the Conservatives' hands as things stand, thanks to Labour's cowardice on the AV vote. 

&gt;You also don't have a prayer of changing anything with your 8 MPs. Serves you right for helping the Tories dismantle the welfare state for 5 years, a welfare state, which I remind you was a Liberal idea, William Beverage ( a Liberal) first came up with the welfare state, and David Lloyd George ( a Liberal) introduced national insurance and unemployment benefit.

This patronising bollocks isn't even tangentially related to the point I was making. Leave the posturing to /r/unitedkingdom, please.

Seriously. Read a history book first.

They boycotted it because of the reasons stated above.

People had a free choice but they decided to follow the SDLPs advice


&gt;Like who?

Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more. 


&gt;They wanted to disrupt the functioning of the North by disrupting commerce and business, and making Northern Ireland as a state economically non-viable. I thought everyone knew this, were you not taught this in school? They phoned in warnings so as few as possible civilians were killed in the process.


Everybody knows this Damien but how did bombing a small furniture shop in the Shankill with civilians in it or random bar attacks achieve any of that to name but few.  The warnings were bullshite. Someone would of called a newspaper in dublin. The newspaper in dublin called the Gaurds in Ireland then the Gaurds would call the Ruc and by that time the bomb was already off. The ira didn't give two shites about people and only phoned warnings to gain public support. 

&gt;My god calm down, the British army to this day use the term legitimate target with regards to the war in Afghanistan. It's a universal term of war to dictate moral targets. Soldiers are legitimate targets in war as are informers and such. Innocent civilians are not. It's a pretty simple concept of war without you acting all ""oh how could you"" about the using the phrase.


Why do you keep turning this around on the British army. I have no support for the war in Afghanistan. How is a RUC officer in traffic branch or a British army chef or two pizza delivery men a legitimate target. The IRA thought they were. Only psychopaths think like that Damien.

null,null,EverythingIsFine,null,null,null,"Considering I am getting downvoted for stating facts, I'll leave it from the treasury's mouth for you to figure out. Simply put, the government does not sell bonds in order to spend. Bonds are only used as an interest rate mechanism. http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmpubacc/349/349ap02.htm

A comment lifted from elsewhere: Government spending occurs by crediting bank accounts 100% of the time. A direction is given to credit an account. With taxes, the reverse happens. A direction is giving to debit someones account. These operations are taking place all day, all of the time.

The difference between the two determines whether the government has a deficit or a surplus in their bank reserves at the end of the day. They have to square up what they owe to the BOE. If there is a deficit in the bank reserves that is when the Treasury sells bonds, so that the reserves balance with the BOE is zero. (Bear in mind - *the money has already been created and spent first*) If there is a surplus in the bank reserves the BOE can buy bonds from the commercial banks.

At the same time the commercial banks have to do the exact same thing at the end of the day. Some will have given out too much currency in loans others won't have given out enough. So they buy or sell bonds in the inter-bank market to balance their books. Clearly it is profitable for banks with excess funds to lend to banks with deficits at market rates. Clearly it is profitable to be ""buying"" government bonds.

This inter-bank activity with the reserves at the end of each day is what sets interest rate. The BOE can make the interest rate whatever it likes through this process.

It is ludicrous and a lie to suggest the Treasury sells bonds to fund its spending. The bond dealings are done at the end of the day *after* the government has done it's spending.

Nowadays the BOE or the Treasury pays interest on the bank reserves. So you have to ask the question. Why the hell do they sell bonds if they are paying interest anyways ?

Pre-austerity fetish, if the treasury/government said ""right we need to spend money on the NHS right now, it's collapsing!"" They always then go on to say we have record low interest rates and we can borrow the money we need cheaply. They have *always* said that.

But the thing is...if we spend by crediting accounts why do we have to borrow at all to fund the NHS? We don't need to sell bonds to fund it, it can just be credited, as all government spending is.

The BOE can keep interest rates low, it can decide whatever the interest rate will be by what it does in the overnight market. The Treasury can choose only to sell 3 month bonds and nothing longer in the market if it chooses to. This will keep their interest rate low. It doesn't have to issue well yielding bonds whatsoever.

We don't need to sell bonds to borrow to fund the NHS, or any government spending. It would be far cheaper and easier if the treasury just credited accounts.

The issue of treasury debt is *not* a borrowing operation and you should think of the interest rate management more as a monetary policy, rather than a fiscal policy.

To simplify:

If the government gave the NHS £30 billion on Monday but only collected £1 billion in taxes on Monday. That deficit of £29 billion is destroyed on Monday night in the inter-bank market.

The same would be true if the government gave the NHS £30 billion on Monday but collected £35 billion in taxes on Monday. That surplus of £5 billion is destroyed on Monday night in the inter-bank market.

Daily deficits or surpluses are destroyed every night. Is is a simple double entry accounting book keeping fact. Taxes do not fund any of that process. Reserves are just moved up or down until they all balance to zero.

This is how the Bank Of England reaches it's over night interest rate target. 

So the question is, does long term debt *need* to be issued to achieve that interest rate control?",null,0,null,1438632892,null,null,false,0,ctqa7fg,null,t3_3flvte,null,null,null,t1_ctq60tq,null,null,null,1440260217,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

And they're wrong too. This is the continuation of many years worth of attempts to remove the general public from the decision-making process when it comes to issues that are potentially harmful to capital. We have these clauses in investment treaties and they've already eroded our sovereignty in a multiplicity of ways, and they've help speed up the break-up of the welfare state, public expenditure, healthcare NHS etc. 

&gt; ISDS just stops governments behaving badly

Notice how *behaving badly* is defined here as the democratically legitimate government doing things which could potentially harm capital and free trade. What he means to say is ""if the electorate behaves badly and votes for parties which don't prioritise business""

Let's take a look at these euphemisms, break it down a bit:

&gt;discrimination against foreign companies

In other words to prevent governments from being able to pass tariffs or carry out protectionism to develop nascent industry - which is a political choice. I'm quite in favour of protectionism in various circumstances, but this constitutes *bad behaviour* well excuse me but since when?

&gt;expropriation of assets without compensation

This is to prevent governments from carrying out nationalisation, even if they have a democratic mandate to do so. Compensation according to who? Who determines what is and isn't adaquet compensation? Who else but the state can say what is and what is't private property? 

&gt; those are the things it's designed to protect against.

Yes, exactly as I said the purpose is to protect businesses who might suffer from those sorts of policies by making it impossible for the general public to elect a government that can carry them out legally. 

In other words to insulate capitalism and the market from democracy.

I like Owen Jones. He engages in arguments in a positive way and he has positive motives. However he also suffers from the bubble mentality in that he thinks the circles he moves in are indicative of the nation as a whole.

Look at this thread with many people talking of how Corbyn is gaining support from all around because of x or y. This is all support from the inside. People who are politically active, people on Twitter and Facebook, Reddit and grass root supporters. He is also reaching people who may have voted Green or likewise. However this isn't a sweeping movement across the nation most of whom don't follow the mechanics of internal party politics as closely as we are doing here. 

Your last sentence sums it up: 

&gt; From my perspective it's really demonstrating a lot of right wingers and centralists are afraid of him.

This is a lot of the electorate. Whilst it's true you can move the centre I don't think you can move it as radically left to a point where the United Kingdom elects someone who is anti-trident, pro-Irish unification, anti-Nato, wants to enter a dialogue with Argentina over the Falklands and wants to increase taxes and spending to a degree not seen since even 1945 wins the election. 

Now people can still elect Corbyn, many believe it's worth it to have a true opposition to the Tories. Fair enough. However let's not play this deluded game where we pretend that it's only the right-wing narrative that would make him winning a General Election a momentous task. It will be. *It's quite unlikely he would win a General Election*. 

This is why the centrists in the Labour party are concerned. They would rather tone down the message and win an election than lose on a ideologically pure platform. 

The goal of politics should be to effect change and for the Conservatives and Labour this means winning an election. If that means you need to sacrifice something things in order to win then so be it. The Tories are doing that and so now they're cutting child tax credits and disability benefits.

Find your bond symbol here:

Bonds only trade in certain lot sizes, sometimes 100, sometimes 1,000, sometimes more or less than either of those. You can kind of work out what the lot size is through that LSE site and looking at the volumes of the last 5 trades in the bond that you want, if they're all multiples of 1,000 then it's most like 1,000, etc.

Enter an order with that lot size and it will go through. Make sure you select UK equities as the market rather than UK bonds, as well. It will work with UK bonds but for an ISA they ask you to specify an amount in currency to spend rather than an amount of shares so it's pretty much impossible to get the right lot size in the number of bonds that you're looking to buy by guessing the total value of the trade.

Presumably you don't work a seven day week? As I said sunscreen is important at least when the UV index is 3+, you would need to check the Met Office weather forecast for any time you are exposed. UV light can penetrate cloud and glass; late and early in the day there is a higher percentage UVA rays around which can darken existing pigmentation.

Do not use any topical that turns your skin bright red unless a doctor has specifically advised you to do so. Your skin is telling you loud and clear that the BP is causing irritation/ inflammation.

null,null,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,null,"&gt;We have got the message that you don't like him. ""I don't like him"" is not contributing things of interest to the conversation.

A cursory reading of my comment brings up these substantive points :

* He focuses excessively on references to the NUM strikes of the 1980s and the Iraq War, to the detriment of any positive, forward-looking vision he could set out.
* His speech was largely just ""nice things! not nasty tory things!"", content-wise - the only substantive stance he's actually standing on is being nebulously ""anti-austerity"", draped in the trappings of a Labour Party the electorate rejected time and time again the last time they reared their heads.
* I don't think he's a good speaker. At all. Cameron absolutely knocks him flat as a public speaker- he'd eat him alive in the Commons and any televised debates. Compare that speech with any of Cameron's Conference speeches- they're clear, they're focused, and they set out a distinct, coherent vision of what kind of country he wants to create. Corbyn just doesn't have that- take away the hype, and you've got a mediocre speaker who's spent thirty years on the backbenches for a reason.

I'm sorry that my opinion that Corbyn will be a catastrophe for the Labour Party and the country is irritating you. You're welcome to actually respond to the points, rather than complaining about somebody having the temerity to comment on stories *in political subreddits* about the politician who's been by far the most prominent political figure in the media for the past fortnight.",null,0,null,1438634653,null,null,false,0,ctqbfiv,null,t3_3fn7vw,null,null,null,t1_ctqb0pl,null,null,null,1440260859,null,0,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

null,null,L41r,null,null,null,"&gt; That's where the logic of this breaks down. If there's a spectrum, there needs to be definable points on either end to even call it a spectrum. What are the two points and how are they characterized?
 
By that argument the energy wavelength spectrum (of which colour is a part) doesn't exist because it doesn't have a measurable beginning or end, only hypothetical ones. The one point is a brain which has been androgenised to the point where it cannot be androgenised further. The other is a brain which has by some miracle not been androgenised one bit. As with maximum and minimum wavelength, both of these theoretically exists but does not exist in reality.

As for which is which, the female side would be the less androgenised side and the male side would be the more androgenised side.

Believe me, I detest gender roles as much as the next reasonable person, but just because I think that there's no reason to suspect that gendered behaviours have any neurological basis doesn't mean I don't think that neurological differences that are created by androgenisation exist. I think that they do exist and that there's no evidence or reason to believe that they have any measurable influence on behaviour or skills. In fact, the differences in question are likely mostly to do with gender-specific tasks and the brain's map of the body.

Are you familiar with phantom limb syndrome? It's when part of someone's body isn't present but they feel sensations of it being there because their brain's map of the body says it should be. 2/3^rds of cis men who'd lost their penises reported phantom penile sensations. 60% of trans men reported the exact same sensations.",null,0,null,1438634667,null,null,false,0,ctqbfvp,null,t3_3fiuel,null,null,null,t1_ctqaq2j,null,null,null,1440260865,null,1,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

null,null,ADozenNeverNudes,null,null,null,"No /u/yukyum is right - the fact that they made money off you in other ways is irrelevant, they still made a high initial investment. To be honest, you are raising a lot of very irrelevant points like you refering people now employed there. 

In law there is a common saying - don't put a turd on an otherwise appetising plate. Basically, limit yourself to a small number of good arguments, don't add another weak or incorrect one as it makes the whole case look bad. Throwing too many points in is a very common mistake lay people make. 

The law on recovery of training fees essentially considers three factors:

(I) Was the employee given fair notice?

(II) Is the training standard, or relate to core duties?

(III) Do the terms of recovery reflect a genuine pre-estimate of loss, or do they merely act as a deterint to the employee leaving?

I think it is fair to say your employer is home and dry on point 1. Point 3 is next most important. This is very fact dependant. The pre-estimate of loss is considered at the original time, it is then irrelevant if the employer does not then actually suffer that much loss, it only matters if it was reasonable to think they would. For example, if the training doesn't even cost your employer £20k then they can't possibly claim that back as they could never consider that would be an actual loss. Other factors in your favour are that there is no sliding scale, it would be more reasonable if the amount you had to repay over time decreased. Point two is useful if training is purely in house, if it was just the training required to allow you to do the job in the first place then that isn't usually recoverable, normally recovery is for thinks like external training. 

Also 14 days to pay back £20k is laughable. Your response was right, say nothing substantive until you get proper advice. Don't be drawn into saying something that will weaken your positiom without you even realising. 

To be honest your OP is quite confusing and often off topic so it is hard to tell what case you may have. All I can say is £20k is the most I have ever heard an emoloyer try to claim, it would be worth sitting down with a lawyer for an hour (even if it costs £250). I wouldn't be suprised if he advises a short letter on the law firm's letterhead to scare off your employer. Please note it is important to approach this factually, without emotion, give your lawyer all the information they need, but a lot of the points you raise do not matter - frankly, to use the analogy I referred to earlier, they are turds.

They had to guarantee savers deposits which was the largest 'expense' although a run on the banks never occurred so this insurance was never used.

The money didn't go into the banks pockets they just held up certain troubled asset prices. This happened primarily in the US though not the UK. It was called TARP (targeted asset relief program). They basically bought the bad debts to protect the banks customers.

What they were worried about was a big bank being forced to go bankrupt and regular peoples savings being lost. You've probably heard of 'too big to fail' that's what they were referring to.

In no way did government fund bankers bonuses.

The only instance people could make this argument (and it's very tenuous) is the government bailing out AIG which led to Goldman getting paid for the bets they made against AIG. This wasn't a direct case of government paying off bankers but they did ensure that Goldman got paid for bets they made against AIG (whilst AIG were their customers no less).

How you deal with that one is a bit of a grey area. That being said that was the US not the UK.

I actually highly doubt the guy in this documentary is a banker because anyone with a rudimentary understanding of finance would know that.

Anyhow, I agree with you too that the role of ""DM"" is really the myth, not Lucas being a good DM or not. Lucas is Lucas, and you judge a player by what he can *bring* into our game. Post FM, people like to think of players in terms of categories like CDM, AMR, DR etc. This is not the way you should look at player. Instead, each football *system* (not formation) has a set of roles, which then you pick players who can play those roles. 

Lucas' roles are (1) break up play in front of our back 4 (2) *cycle* the ball in possession (3) provide an outlet for the back 4.

(1) is self-explanatory, that's the usual ""CDM"" role that most people on reddit think his role is.

(2) cycling the ball is less well known, but it's actually Lucas' big strength. Watch him play, his role is to distribute the ball quickly to the players who can do damage, i.e. either the forward midfielders, or the overlapping wingbacks. He gets the ball (either by winning it, or from being passed to it by one of the back 4, or by the forward MF when we need to draw out their defense). This is his trademark skill -- in 2014/15, when he and Coutinho is on the field, just count the number of times Lucas passes the ball to him : it's because that's his job is to get the ball to our playmaker. He also provides a safe outlet to retain possession. In brazil, this role is call the *volante* -- and here is an old (but still true) [article](http://brasilivero.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/lucas-leivas-position-defensive.html) that explain his role, both in Gremio and why Rafa bought him.

(3) provide an outlet for the back 4. This is Gerrard's old role when he was our *volante* in 2013/14. In Rodgers' system of playing (and possession based teams), we seek to bring the ball forward on the ground. When our back 4 has the ball, the opposition has 2 choices : (a) press high (b) get back in defensive shape without pressing (btw, Rodgers like to do (a)). In (b), the defense has plenty of time to pass it to the attacking midfield so no problems. But in (a), the defense is under pressure immediately -- if they press with 2 up, then our 2 central defenders are both under pressure, so the only way out is to pass to the fullbacks. But in this case, the opposition has already slowed down our attack, and also has the possiblity of forcing an error from our CD. Lucas' role here is to provide the extra man for the defense -- notice how Lucas (and also Gerrard in 13/14) drop into the the same line as the 2 CD when the opposition press high. Once Lucas gets the ball, he reverts to his (2) role : cycle the ball.

Hope this helps. This is why we don't need a CDM  :we don't play with a true CDM in our system. We play with a ball cycler who also doubles to proteect the back 4. Gerrard was amazing as a cycler (role (2) and (3)) but was terrible as (1). Lucas is good in all 3 : the only thing he lacks compared to stevie is his long passing range (which was a crucial aspect of our quick transition play in 13/14).

null,null,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt; Think Warbutton has what it takes?

I feel pretty confident we will be able to get straight promotion. It's harder to say how we will do against tougher opponents.  The way I see it, Warburton's tactics are well suited for challenging for a league but it will be interesting to see how he sets himself up in the latter stages of cup competitions.  We might have to go with a more pragmatic approach in those sort of games.

&gt; Whats your thoughts on the signings so far?

- Wes Foderingham - hasn't really had enough to do
- Danny Wilson - we already knew he was a decent defender particularly from his performances last season with Hearts. He looks comfortable playing with the ball at his feet which should suit our new style of play
- Rob Kiernan - haven't seen enough of him
- James Tavernier - has played really well in both games. Seems like he will be a really exciting player. Good going forwards but remains to be seen how good he is defensively. Also glad that we now seem to have a competent free kick taker in him.
- Andy Halliday - really does seem to play for the jersey. Looks good at breaking up opposition play and it also seems a that he can find a pass.
- Jason Holt - seems to have made a decent start but I need to see more of him.
- Martin Waghorn - seems like a strong, energetic striker that will run all game. If he can improve his finishing then he could turn out to be a very decent player.

&gt; and do you think you still need to strenghen certain areas?

I don't think we need more players but a if we were to add more depth to the squad it could probably do with more wide players in the attacking areas. Templeton and Shiels will probably be okay for this season but I don't think they should be part of our long term plans.

&gt; Only managed to see Rangers play a handfull of games last year and everytime I watched them they looked pretty dreadful.

Last year it felt like a chore to watch Rangesr. Now I can't wait for the next game. I've not felt like that for a long long time.

Or look at the attack against British holidaymakers in Tunisia.

That isn't evidence. And it lists gender identity disorder as a related condition not because of any evidence that the two are related in cause, but so that it can look to see whether they are related in cause. The two have superficially similar symptoms, yes, but you have yet to provide any evidence that they have even similar causes, let alone that one's the subset of the other.

&gt;gender dysphoria is not a subset of BDD, and cannot be treated with SSRI's and psychotherapy

By definition, no such studies ever could exist, as you're asking me to find a study that proves the null hypothesis. It works the other way around – you need to find a reputable study that rejects the null hypothesis and finds that it is a subset of BDD and that SSRIs and Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy are effective at treating gender dysphoria. This is a basic fact of science and statistics that you would know if you were at all educated in them.

And it's not as if nobody's looked into it before – hell, loads of trans people take SSRIs simply because of the massive comorbidity between being trans and anxiety disorders and depression, so if SSRIs alleviated the symptoms of gender dysphoria for most, someone would have noticed by now.

Also, I think it incredibly telling that no reputable medical organisation recommends the prescription of SSRIs or the administration of Cognitive-Behavioural therapy instead of HRT and talk therapy to affirm one's gender identity.",null,0,null,1438636127,null,null,false,0,ctqcg88,null,t3_3fiuel,null,null,null,t1_ctqblaw,null,null,null,1440261340,null,1,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

You'll forgive my lack of sympathy for her. 

What's more, people like her take away resources from the genuinely homeless, who are often there due to unfortunate circumstances.

4-2-3-1 is actually a really defensive shape because you would have much less transition - it becomes a 4-5-1, 4-2-1-3 (most offensive) or a 4-4-1-1 whereas the 4-3-3 can become a 3-4-3, 4-5-1, 4-1-4-1 and 4-3-1-2 fluidly. Even a 4-4-2 diamond is possible if the forward comes deep and the wingers / inside forwards push through to pin back the full backs or run the inside channels. 

I do wonder if he's been experimenting with the 4-2-3-1 or 4-2-1-3 in preseason so he can use Milner and Hendo as a double pivot alternating holding and pressing responsibilities rather than just assigning it to one player. Scholes was always more advanced than Carrick but he could do some great holding if he needed to. Unique talent though, him. 

I think 4-3-3 is Rodgers' favoured though. He's a safe monkey bars man. Never goes from bar to bar in one go - needs to have a hand on each bar at any time. 

I suspect Stoke away will probably see a 4-3-3 with a Lucas base but I'd love for him to surprise us with his preferred formation and style rather than an overly safe lineup. We have lots of tougher away games coming up very soon - 3 points here is crucial.

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; EU - an elected parliament

The EU and the EU Parliament are not the same thing. The EU parliament is only one of the many institutions that make up the EU and you know this. Furthermore much of the power of the EU is not in the parliament which is little better than a rubber-stamping body.

&gt;Eurogroup - a meeting of elected national finance ministers

The Eurogroup is an informal, ad-hoc group that no-one votes for, has no basis in the consitution of any nation-state, and which can pass laws and exercise power without any democratic oversight. It doesn't take minutes, it meets in secret, and it's decision cannot be challenged by the vote in any country.

Finance ministers are appointed in most cases, not elected, and they are elected to national office not to the Eurogroup, which is an un-elected body with no democratic credentials at all - just the way capital likes it.

&gt;G7 - a meeting of elected heads of state

Elected heads of state? Does the Queen go to the G7? I don't remember voting in any G7 election. The ""heads of state"" are elected to perform a certain function within certain localities and are supposed to be accountable to the people. The G7 on the other hand has no constitutional basis, there are no G7 elections, there is no mechanism to challenge the decisions that are made there.

&gt;Davos (World Economic Forum) - A discussion forum with no regulatory or rule making powers

And yet ahere actual decision are made and real power is exercised at Davos. 

&gt;NATO - Run by council of representatives of the members elected governments

Run by people who aren't elected, can't be removed, aren't accountable to the general population and have no democratic legitimacy. 

&gt;Literally the end of democracy.......

Yup. Literally. None of these institutions, apart from the EU parliament (which has only very limited constitutional power) are remotely democratic. People vote for representatives in national democracies, the powers those representatives wield are powers we give to them and can take away from them. None of this applies to the things I've listed.

&gt;Seriously globalisation is a thing, there is no reversing that rules and regulations have to be made at a supra-national level for the betterment of everyone. 

Rules and regulations that are made for the betterment of *capital* and very often at the expense of democracy. Rules and regulations that cannot be challenged democratically, and which can override the wishes of democratically elected national and local governments, essentially reducing national and local elections to a sideshow and taking real power out of the people's hands and putting it behind closed doors.",null,0,null,1438637441,null,null,false,0,ctqda2d,null,t3_3fn7f0,null,null,null,t1_ctqcnfg,null,null,null,1440261730,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Well you kind keep it on the down low, but people tend to work it out as neighbours and can't hold their water to tell others but they'll never say that they know.

I**s it true you're not allowed to police the area you live in?**

Not any more. It used to be the case you lived in Belfast and worked in Fermanagh but now people work in say Belfast and live in Moira.

**I sat the initial screening test to join the PSNI a few years ago but never pursued it after that. What's the recruitment process like after that?**

The process is fairly rigorous, fitness tests etc. Like every recruitment process a few silly billys always get through.

**Do you enjoy it? is so/not, why?**

I work in uniform and I do but morale has never been lower due to the bureaucracy. If you like it it is tremendously rewarding. What other job can you talk to peoples children, stroke their pets on one hand, comfort people through grief on another. It is not an easy job though.

**Is there anything specifically about the PSNI you wish more people knew?**

Yes, I have never once in many many years witnessed and other peeler exhibit any form of sectarianism. We treat all sides the same (at least anyone I have worked with) and try our best to be civil in the face of some very very harsh 'customers'

Corbyn stood to inspire debate, and that has been exactly what has happened. And this debate is absolutely vital to the future of the Labour Party, because Labour cannot continue as a party of two poles of right and left, with the left being frankly bigger, that hate each other. The situation is pretty dire: the crucible of the party, Scotland, can't stand the Labour Party right now and is probably going to kick out much of the Labour contingent at Holyrood in the next election. The white working class largely votes Tory and if they don't, they vote UKIP. The left of the party has been bleeding votes since Iraq, first to the Lib Dems, now to the Greens and the SNP. Nobody really knows what Labour stands for anymore, except maybe loving the NHS or something. On top of all this are boundary changes and a fractured party system that are going to make it very difficult for Labour to get a clear parliamentary majority. 

Corbyn as leader offers the promise of two things: one, that new groups will join the Labour Party and maybe some of them will stay after he moves on, and two, that groups of people will leave the Labour and the rest of the party will be more united. It's possible he's quickly deposed in a PLP coup for a Blairite, in which case the left of the party will probably throw in the towel and move somewhere else. It's also possible he has a successful run as leader, shifts the party's paradigm leftward, and the Blairites go somewhere else...though I'm not entirely sure where that is. We will finally get a sense of reckoning about what the Labour Party is about. This has to happen - the can can't be kicked down the road anymore.

Lucas doesn't pass the ball solely side to side like Allen. You see a lot of forward passes in the middle of the park, as you said about Coutinho. Most of Gerrard's passes were long passes switching play. While this was great, it didn't keep play ticking on as fast as you can see with Lucas at times. Lucas gets the ball and passes immediately. He also is much more comfortable splitting the center backs when creating width when the full backs get up the wing (the position in which Gerrard slipped). Again, that plays right into Rodger's system with forward thinking full backs. This also creates space in the middle of the park for Henderson and Coutinho to have more space to operate. It also allows fluidity for the ""wingers"" like Lallana to have space to operate or come inside. 

Lastly on the passing and ball retention. Lucas always is looking to relieve pressure from the defenders with the ball. He gives them the simple option at all times. He positions himself to receive the ball safely and recycle possession. 

In terms of defense, Lucas breaking up play is one of the things that does set him apart from Allen and Gerrard in this role. He heads the ball away better than Allen, tackles far better than Gerrard, and fouls at the right time.

null,null,lobbmaster,null,null,null,"&gt; There are issues with this. Look at the average position of the opposition we played during that run - out of 10 games (excluding United since he didn't play) we played 7 bottom-half teams. The 3 top-half teams we played were at all at home. Our most difficult game was Arsenal at home, and we drew.
After Lucas got injured, we won 5 games in a row, including difficult wins against Spurs, Southampton (away) and City - teams hard to beat home or away.

Yes we had ""easier"" games during that run with Lucas, but during those 2 months where he was starting we were the 2nd most dangerous team in the league in terms of goal chances created, shots on target, shots in the box etc. 

Once Lucas got injured we plummeted to 12th-15th most dangerous attacking team in the league immedieately. We didn't create many chances in those 5 games we won after he got injured, we just scored a lot of crazy long goals, without us suddenly being blessed with good accuracy from long shots we would've struggled in all those games. 

I've [written about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/3001bb/a_new_look_at_the_underlying_statistics_in_the/) before also.. When for example Allen played instead of Lucas (and the team was otherwise identical) then Hendersons stats going forward dropped by 60% (key passes, shots etc), same with the team stats. 

When Lucas is playing he can hold his own infront of our defense and this gave Henderson a lot more freedom, and this is the main reason why I think Lucas should play whenever fit. He might not be ideal, but untill we buy another DM then he is by far the best option.. I also think he's ability to quikly move the ball from our half to the opposition half is overlooked too much, he's quite good at making 20-40 meter passes along the ground to our attacking players without much hesitation, compared to our other CMs. ",null,0,null,1438638113,null,null,false,0,ctqdoyx,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,1440261926,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

For me at least, I have to believe the economics of a candidates plan will work out. Promising nice things is all good and well (everyone likes nice things) but only if there's a realistic plan in place to pay for them. 

If I'm not convinced of that plan, then they might have well not made the promise of nice things.

So we should abandon democracy because it's too much effort? lol at least that's a bit more honest of you.

Although I'd actualy prefer it if those institutions (EU, IMF, WTO etc) were simply destroyed altogether. They're not democratically legitimate.

&gt;We elect a government and by doing so appoint them to make decisions for us for the next 5 years.

We elect a government, we don't elect the World Trade Organisation or the IMF, the election are for the House of Commons, not for the G7 or any of these other institutions. What power the government has is restricted to what the constitution says they can or cannot do. 

&gt;That includes representing our interests abroad and at world organisations.

They might be able to represent our interest abroad but they don't have the right to hand over these powers to unaccountable and unelected institutions. They have powers within a constitutional framework - the House of Commons, the crown in parliament, all the rest of it. We don't have elections to the IMF do we? 

&gt;David Cameron is the prime minster of a democratically elected government, to call a group where he is our representative ""undemocratic"" is ridiculous.

It's entirely appropriate. We didn't elect Cameron as prime minister, he was chosen by his party. We didn't elect him to be our representative at the G7 or whatever, he was elected to me an MP and then chosen by this party to lead them in the House of Commons. That's where his authority ends. These other institutions are totally undemocratic, with the partial exception of the EU parliament, which is constitutionally hamstrung but at least we can vote for it (however even there it's very weak semi-democracy) 

Powers are being taken away from the democratic sphere and being replaced by supra-national instutions which don't have elections, aren't accountable to the general population, can't be removed, and make policy in the interests of capital.

VAT, I will have to pay 20% for the total sale price of the order

- No, the person who receives the goods in the UK will be responsible for this, perhaps this is you but it's unclear.

Do I need a VAT registration number or anything? I just am selling to another vendor, so that will be the limit of my business in UK/EU.

-No you don't.

If the person you are selling to is VAT-Registered Business, they will be collecting VAT from their customers. Does that mean, I, the supplier then have to pay any VAT? It sounds like the responsibility of paying/collecting VAT is transferred to my vendor.

-If the person has a VAT registered business they will pay the 20% import tax up front, then collect 20% of their total EU/UK sales, this can be offset against the original amount they paid.

I buy from my supplier for $X, and selling it to my vendor/distributor for $Y. Do I pay VAT on how much I get the goods from my supplier, or how much I am selling it to my vendor in UK, when importing?

- This sort of complicates it a bit but they will be paying VAT on the amount they paid (you) for the goods.

null,null,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"That's a good point but there's a massive factor you highlight yourself - the change in formation.

From your post:
&gt; I'm not sure of course but I think that we formation change from 1 DM to Henderson+Allen playing together infront of the defense is an important factor to our declining attacking numbers. 

Also moving Sterling to RWB and playing Sturridge (who was clearly not 100% fit) up front for a few games until he got injured again is another significant change. 

I'm not blaming Lucas, but you can't say that it was the only reason our stats declined when we clearly made significant changes to tactics and personnel. 

Maybe Rodgers needs to be braver and stick to a formation and only replace the players (i.e. use Allen as a holding midfielder rather than suddenly shift to a double pivot for several games to ""compensate""). 

Our players are flexible in-game but it's not a thing you should abuse endlessly by changing formations every time there is an injury or clear loss of form by a key player.

Lucas is good at what he does and Allen does not compare, I agree. But if we want to occasionally play a holding midfielder in some games to let players like Henderson/Milner/Coutinho (in the diamond or in aggressive 4-3-3s) bomb forward because our forwards need help, then is Lucas the right player to protect the defence for a top 4 team?

EDIT: A key point I am also trying to make is that Lucas has the attributes of a defensive midfielder rather than a holding midfielder. He can pass the ball forward well and has comparable completion and distance stats, but he has zero output (assists, goals, clear cut chances created) and unpredictability (mixing short and long balls) and this will never change. When we are playing weaker teams in a high block, this absolutely kills our penetration because Henderson/Allen/Can/Coutinho/Gerrard needed to drop back to collect the ball from him.",null,0,null,1438639139,null,null,1438639407,0,ctqecao,null,t3_3fmrz9,null,null,null,t1_ctqdoyx,null,null,null,1440262231,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

No it isn't. There's no elections for the IMF. Or the WTO. Or the World Bank. Or NATO. Or the Eurogroup. 

Where's my IMF representative then? When did he or she get elected? How can I remove them if I disagree with what they're doing? What powers have they got and where's the constitutional framework they operate under?

&gt;I am perfectly happy for our elected government to represent me abroad

But are you happy about a treaty being signed which makes democratically elected governments subordinate to unelected court systems that meet in private and can overrule laws and policies that challenge free trade?

Who said anything about 50 elections a year btw

&gt;in a globalised world how do you propose we do things without super-national organisations like these?

We could fully do without NATO, the IMF, the World Bank, Davos, the G7 and the council of ministers. There are other institutions too that have real power that I would like to see destroyed. 

Who's this we btw? Because the purpose of these organisations is to regulate global capitalism, finding a new series of institutions that can make rules and regulations to faciliate capitalism and resolve disputes between capitalists on a global scale. This is traditionally the function of a state, so what we're dealing with is a state power being taken away from democratically accountable bodies (such as national parliaments) and replaced with un-elected and un-accountable bodies.

I'd like the EU to be replaced by something much less bureacratic and much more democratic, that existed within clear constitutional boundaries, which would be able to carry out the functions currently associated with unelected bodies such as the ones I listed.

null,null,SkiZag,lfc68,,null,"""at this role"" is the key phrase in my thought process. Gerrard's passing is clearly better. But I think that Gerrard's passing was much more useful when he was further up the pitch and under less pressure, such as the position that Henderson takes up. Gerrard had much more space and license to operate when Mascherano and/or Alonso free him up. I do not believe Gerrard freed other players up. Example being Henderson holding back to make sure Gerrard had cover, even though Gerrard was taking up that position to be the cover. 

I also was trying to point out the difference in the type of passing. Gerrard was much more adventurous in passing, which is great, but that is more useful and more safe if you have cover behind you. For example, I don't mind Coutinho losing the ball because he has that 1 great ball that comes off and leads to a scoring opportunity.

Doesn't seem like there's any point in these treaties at all then. Something tells me that if this were to actually happen then the powerful vested interests that these treaties are designed to protect would not throw their hands up with resignation and give in. Greece shows us just how willing the ""institutions"" are to subvert the norms of national sovereignty and democracy if and when it suits them.

&gt;A government that wants to just expropriate assets without compensation isn't going to care what the international opinion of them is anyway.

This isn't true. I mean Britain has nationalised assetts with only the barest minimum of compensation in it's not too recent history, as have most European countries.

&gt;For instance George Osborne has made a law requiring budget surpluses in times of growing GDP. If we get a socialist government presumably they'll just overturn it, not the end of the world.

That's a law which is on shaky constitutional ground anyway since, in theory, one parlament cannot bind it's successor. These treaties and laws like this are very close to making neo-liberalism a constitutional pre-requisitite embedded deeply in the structures of the governing institutions.

&gt;That is so short sighted its unreal.

""Barriers to trade"" - such as democracy. This is exactly what I'm saying all along - capitalism and democracy are basically incompatable, and as time is going on democracy is being weakened because it's a ""barrier to trade"" to use your own euphemism.

&gt;Urm........ ballsy statement, the last 3 are just discussion groups so whatever but the first 3 are fairly important.

Yes the same way the Eurozone just an ""informal meeting of finance ministers"" with no actual power. I'm sure the citizens of Greece would find that pretty funny as they send their legislation off to the institutions to be pre-approved before it goes to parliament. 

These organisations hold real power. They might wel refer to them in public as a ""discussion group"" but when that discussion groups tells the ECB to shut your banking system down to starve the population into submission, as they recently did with Greece, then the notion that these are merely talking shops is delusional. 

After all the world Parliament means ""discussion group"" but no-one would say they have no power...

&gt;Here's what I find odd, presumably if David Cameron meets Obama and they agree to work towards some goal (say, stopping climate change) you think thats fine, since they are both acting as representatives of their respective governments?

It depends whether in the process they create executive and judicial bodies which are totally undemocratic and strip power away from democratically accountable institutions.

I'm opposed to the idea that courts can overrule legislation passed by democratically elected governments if they don't conform to the decisions of unelected and arbitrary authority whose only purpose is to defend ""free trade""",null,0,null,1438640385,null,null,1438641408,0,ctqf3zg,null,t3_3fn7f0,null,null,null,t1_ctqepms,null,null,null,1440262594,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Julian Huppert's sadly-poorly-supported amendment would've seriously improved it:

It's like going to watch a boxing match and needing to confirm you're aware there's going to be a fight. Declaring bias in a column piece is likewise just redundant. You're not supposed to treat it like a piece of carefully polished, unbiased presentation, so it's unreasonable to hold it to the standards of one.

That's not even getting into the absolute worm's nest of what constitutes something worthy of note. There are people who will assume a chance meeting with an electoral candidate is evidence that the journalist is utterly corrupt. Plus journalists by the nature of their job have to have ties with 'VIPs'- or at least people close to them. How many of those need to be disclosed? How many can?

How about an example, Britian signs a treaty which says ""we promise we won't invade France"", that agreement has a lot of weight, the British government is generally trustworthy and sticks to its treaties. If instead Russia signs an agreement that says ""we promise we won't invade [insert former soviet East European country]"" that probably isn't worth the paper it's written on.

At the moment he's not fit to start for us, he actually makes the other defenders play worse as well because they don't know what the hell yes going to do.

I think Jones is right here (well, he has to be; he's just saying what everyone has said since Corbyn came around) but to dig a little deeper, the reason the Labour establishment is in such disarray is that they've profoundly misunderstood New Labour; they see it as a PR trick to take power and not as anything deeper. The lesson they get from New Labour is ""go towards the centre and you'll get elected"" while Blair's actual philosophy was ""put forward a modern
vision and you'll get elected"" or to say it shorter: BE. MODERN.

In the Labour Party in the 90s, being modern meant a pretty sharp turn towards the right, because it was stuck in a completely outdated mode of thinking, which Clause IV represented. In the Labour Party of the 2010s, I don't think there's need for a further trip to the right - and I certainly don't think there's need for voting for Cameron's welfare bill. But there is need for a vision. And in the absence of a modern vision, people (and particularly Labour Party activists) will default to the traditional, romantic left-wing vision which Corbyn incarnates - pretty well I might say. And that vision, for all the good feeling it radiates, is outdated and just plain inadapted to this world. It's also unelectable, but this shouldn't be the main argument; Labour shouldn't say ""yes, of course we want this, but the people don't"", they should say ""we don't want this and neither do the people because X and we are proposing Y instead"".

So you're saying unless *all* British governments agree to abide by the rules of these treaties they would no longer be trustworthy? Even if those treaties take up poltical positions that the government of the time is opposed to?

So unless every government that follows from George Osborne agrees in perpetuity to follow that treaty then Britain would be ""untrustworthy"" and suffer from some sort of punishment as a result?

Any examples? Reading the top 20 posts of last week I see the following broadly ""left-wing interest"" points of view:

* Daily Mail article comparison from 1938 and 2015 relating to the migrants presented without comment

* Concerns over Murdoch's influence on the BBC cuts

* Corbyn in the lead after trade union support

* Criticism of trickle-down economics

* Corbyn riding the night bus with a comment about how he keeps his expenses low

* Public supports renationalisation of rail and utilities

* Concern over ""fees to plead not guilty""

* Criticism of peers' expenses

* Comparison of UK and EU house prices relative to salary

* Article supporting Corbyn against 'mudslinging'

How is any of that insane? It's more or less what social democratic MPs say quite regularly. It's what left-wing mainstream media says. No one is calling for a class war or an overthrow of the establishment as the Communist strawman you've painted is.

[Look at the comments in this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3f09hj/a_man_has_been_killed_as_at_least_1500_migrants/) and tell me /r/UK has a complete ban on and hatred for right-wing comments. Note the lack of ""OPEN THE BORDERS LET THEM ALL IN"" that you would have left-wingers shouting from the rooftops in the top comments. 

Like any political arena /r/uk is generally divided on many issues. It does have a larger and louder left-wing contingent than a right-wing one but that's largely due to its outward demographic (young, white, university-educated men). But it goes at least somewhat right-wing on immigration, most issues of gender, racism and sexism, especially vis-a-vis new 'post-modern' activism, and on things like patriotism and nationalism. 

Although perhaps that is ""ultra left wing"" for you considering [you were defending the Confederate flag, justifying the South's secession and 'rebel' movement](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3fh0ch/the_man_who_burned_the_confederate_flag_has_a_gun/ctotv99?context=3) yesterday.",null,0,null,1438642337,null,null,1438648402,0,ctqg9xg,null,t3_3fmtdz,null,null,null,t1_ctqcbhs,null,null,null,1440263142,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Well as you've been seeing for yourself, policies that are potentialy harmful to capital can and will be made illegal under these treaties. Based on what little we know the idea is they can be struck down by unelected courts and compensation can be given to capitalists if the people choose to vote for any government that prioritises their 
welfare over that of capital.

And they vote for governments which are increasingly limited in the sorts of powers they exercise and are mitigated in their actions by other non-democratic institutions. Real power doesn't exist on the government level, a new state architecture is being formed out of things like the IMF, WTO, NATO, etc as well as through these treaties which will over a period of time take power away from places where the public can influence them via the ballot and put those powers into the hands of people who are unelected, unaccountable and have no sense of obligation to anyone outside of the rich and powerful.

Is that democratic? Does it mention anywhere in the Greek constitution that sovereignty and democracy can be bypassed to creditors?

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Yeah the current one and the one people expect to be in power subsequently.

Exactly. This means no matter who you vote for, governments will be bound to obey the treaties that George Osborne is signing us up to. This is manifestly undemocratic, but as I've been saying all along democracy has historically always been at odds with capitalism, and we're seeing capitalism's anti-democratic tendencies reassert themselves as a response to the crisis of 2008 and after. 

&gt;So maybe it comes down more to the trustworthiness of the electorate that gives these treaties value but the point it mostly just semantics.

No it's not semantics is crucially important. Signing up not just this current government but all future governments to a treaty which is highly political in nature, and which would take judicial and executive power away from the (democratically elected) parliament and place it in the hands of unelected bodies that we simply have no control over, which at this point haven't been specified, due to the secretive nature of the discussions, but seem to involve secret courts and arbitration procedures that take precidence over any democratic body and act as law. This is not just some random treaty it's laying down the foundations of a new form of supra-national institution that can regulate globalisation in a highly undemocratic way.

&gt;This isn't some formal process, as I said international treaties have value in so much as the expectation of the extent that they will be honoured. If that expectation changes then the value and faith placed in the treaty change with it. 

It's not just a treaty though, is it? It's a treaty which isn't just an an international agreement but a transfer of political power from elected institutions to unelected institutions. I think you're being deliberately disingenuous about this. Either spit it out and say ""I think that decisions about nationalisation etc should be resolved in private because that would benefit trade and capitalism"" or say ""I would rather those decisions be made publicly in institutions that are democratically accountable *even if* this is harmful to free trade, as I value democracy over capitalism"" rather than this sort of equivocation and dissimulation.",null,0,null,1438642929,null,null,false,0,ctqgm6s,null,t3_3fn7f0,null,null,null,t1_ctqgc63,null,null,null,1440263303,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So it's democratic for parliament to be bypassed by unelected institutions? For another unelected body, the ECB, to overrule a sovereign government?

&gt;No, we aren't in default

Greece isn't in default, they were in arrears briefly with the IMF but they've paid that back a few weeks ago iirc. The next big payment is due towards the end of the month, but right now Greece is not in default.

So now we've cleared that up, and established that neither Britain nor Greece is default, do you think we should allow the holders of British sovereign debt to overrule parliament and write policy instead of MP's? 

Also: could you point to me exactly where in the Greek constitution it stipulates that parliament can be bypassed by the Eurogroup when they're in debt? 

&gt;The Greek people have democratic options, if they want money from the ECB they can agree to their demands.

The ECB doesn't have the legal authority to issue political demands because it's not a political institution. Unless you think that the ECB should become the government of Greece (and idea that would appeal to some sympathisers of technocratic dictatorship no doubt...) 

&gt;Never said they didn't make decisions or discuss important thing, just like good old Dave and Barak make decisions in the Oval Office, within the remit granted to them by their respective legislatures.

You did. You said it was an institution that had no formal power, and carried no political role. Are you saying you were wrong?

* completely inflexible (they would ask that I work Sunday mornings from 5am, despite the fact that I lived an hour's cycle from there and there was no public transport)

* distrustful of ambition (I was told specifically that I could 'forget' being given any responsibility as I'd said I was considering going to university)

* bad at providing a good working environment (our staff room was a tiny table and chair in a room full of lockers, there were no staff toilets, the kitchen had no ventilation and we were only provided with one uniform)

* bad at giving you experience of what a real working environment is like (chatting with coworkers was discouraged and health and safety procedures were ignored)

Lucas is actually amazing at getting the ball forward to the right players. He doesn't make 60 yard incredible passes, he doesn't do a lot of YouTube-highlight worty through balls, but he does pass firm, accurate balls in tight areas to the likes of Coutinho, Lallana and Sterling last season. They are not only getting to the right player, but often also perfectly weighted on their strong foot to be able to turn on one touch pass it to another player.

This is something an average supporter often doesn't see. Not because they can't see it, but because they don't know how much it actually means.

We can see that the stats both says that Lucas has the highest amount of forward passes per 90min, while also having the highest pass completion. 87% accuracy when almost 5/7 passes are going forward. That's amazingly accurate.

He is also a great tackler, but Lucas also covers room and makes the other defenders around him better, as they have less room to care about. This is an ability that stats can't tell.

He is by no means a perfect player, as he has his flaws, but his strenghts is what Liverpool lack in the midfield from all the other players. In my opinion he fits better than both Allen, Henderson and Can in the defensive minded role. Can's natural ability and physical presence is great, but Lucas' ability to read the game and ability to get the ball to the right players is, in my opinion, more important than Can's abilities. I believe that Can is our future in the midfield.

I'm partially one of those people. I'm fine with something like the Godfather where the languages are mixed so I'm only reading the subtitles half the film, but not with a fully subtitled film, it makes watching a film a more difficult and less enjoyable activity. It really takes away from the entertainment and makes the actor's performances less compelling.

null,null,KM567,null,null,null,"OK, I'll respond to the points:

He focuses on the NUM strikes and the Iraq war, because these are important to the members of the labour party, not the issues themselves (although they are important), but what they represent.

* The NUM strikes represent a labour movement that was attacked violently, almost to the point of extinction, by the Tories in their pursuit destroy any alternative narrative to their own. Thatcher wanted to make sure no-one would be able to stand up to and fight against the forces of global financial capital that she released through de-regulation, that no-one would be able to undo what she perceived as her legacy.The members of the labour party see this as a symbol of who they are, in a battle between the miners (individuals whose work was the foundation of the economy) fighting to provide a decent life for themselves, their families and their community against the amoral forces of the wealthy elite who wished to continue living of the economic surpluses created by the rest of society and contribute nothing in return. In this conflict, the labour party took a stand and chose the side of the people, whereas the Tories took the side of the elite. This is representative of why they are members of the labour party and the cornerstone of the labour movement.
* Iraq represents a labour leadership that took the country to war against the wishes of the British people, the members of the labour party/movement, even against their own MPs, with the help of the Tories and using the same underhanded tactics as them, again something that brings up the question, what is the labour party for? if we start doing the same things as the Tories, then why should anyone vote for us other than tribalism, if we do nothing different when we are in power, then why does it matter who wins the election? This is something that became harder to deny as New Labour continued, with the authoritarianism of ID cards and excessive anti-terror legislation, the indifference to increasing inequality and the reluctance to actively support further democracy by implementing things like PR, lower voting age etc...
* The 1997-2001 labour government was one of the best this country has had in a very long time, but after each successive election, we achieved less and less, we conceded more and the reason why we should vote for labour as opposed to the Tories became more blurred. I agree, no labour leader (progressive left) is going to be able to win an election unless they create a ""positive, forward-looking vision"", but they aren't going to be able to say where we go from here, unless they confront our past, they can't just ""try to move on"" like Milliband tried.
* The ""nice things! not nasty Tory things!"" content is because this speech is not suppose to be setting out detailed policy mechanisms, its show where he stands on the issues and ***why*** he disagrees with the Tories on them. This is the first step in spelling out that ""forward-looking vision"" you want, stating what is wrong with the current direction we are headed.
* Whether he is a good speaker or not, is a matter of opinion, baring in mind any leadership candidate is going to debate differently now than after they are elected leader. The point is the tone, the atmosphere of the audience, there is a consistently a sense of hope for a better future around him for many people, something which Andy/Yvette have only had once or twice on a smaller scale. It might be hype it might not, it could collapse before the election, it could carry through, that is not important. what is important is that he can use this to start rebuilding the labour party.
* You said it yourself many times labour needs something like a 12.5% swing away from the conservatives to win if they don't get any Scottish seats back (10% if they get 20/25 seats back). Frankly, no candidate has a great chance of this, unless there is a complete collapse of the economy/conservative party, there is a small chance of this happening and if it does we need a leader who can capitalise on this. Kendall will not be bale to, she is not a great public speaker and rarely opposes the status quo, so it will not be credible coming from her. Andy/Yvette have a reasonable chance, Andy is willing to oppose the Tories more often but is inconsistent (i.e. welfare bill a couple of days ago), where as Yvette opposes less often but is consistent. Corbyn opposes the most and it is reasonably consistent/well informed and comes from a post-Keynesian perspective and he gets support from academia, which helps massively when you have a hostile press and lead a party that is perceived as weak on economics.
* Baring this in mind, the candidates chances of winning an election (an absolute majority) is Kendall with a 2/3% chance (complete loss of core vote will negate any win of swing votes), Andy with a 5-10% chance (maintaining the core vote, not enough progress on swing votes though), Yvette with a 10-15% chance (losing some core vote, but retaining most and good progress on swing votes) and Corbyn with a 5%-15% chance (retaining core vote, gaining back some of the lost votes from LDs, green, SNP, UKIP, PC etc.. and gaining some swing vote, mainly from those not voting currently or younger generations)
* In order of who will gain most votes/seats, it would be Yvette coming first, Andy coming close second, Corbyn close third and Kendall dead last. But neither of the them is likely to win, the best they have is keeping the Tories at a slim majority after boundary review/EVEL, so in reality saying he is not going to win, so don't vote for him is not a great criticism, since the other candidates only have a marginally better chance than him, meaning the 2020 election is not the priority, getting the Tories out is the priority.
* I agree with you, I want the Tories out ***ASAP***, but to suggest it can be done in 2020, is unrealistic (at best, in the kindest terms), so if you elect a leader and puts all our eggs in that basket, we really will be screwed for a generation. This means our best chance of being rid of them are either in 2025/2030 (thanks to the Lib Dems with FTPA, sorry had to be said, it is good idea, terrible implementation). So the question really is which of these candidates is likely to put labour in the right place economically/socially/politically at the right time to increase our chances in 2025/2030, which candidate is going to put the groundwork in to get labour elected in 2025/2030 under their successor? (since regardless of who wins, none of the candidates is likely to remain to be leader for)
* If we don't elect a leader that actually keeps in mind the 2025/2030 election and instead have one that just focuses on the 2020 election (like Ed did with 2015), after they lose it (the likely result, regardless of leader), we will be back exactly where we are now, expect people will have suffered another 5 years of Tory rule and the Tory narrative will be even further entrenched.
* Which brings me to how I see this leadership election. 3 factors. 
 1) Which candidate is going to actually oppose the Tories, capitalise on their failed policies/implementation and push/create credible alternatives to their illiterate economics/philosophy?
 2) Which candidate is going to rebuild the labour party; build up the activists/members, create internal structure/institutes allowing credible, consistent and popular policies to be created and bring the party up to the standard the electorate expects from a ""party of government""? (stupid phrase, but you get the point)
 3) Which candidate is going to sufficiently create a political narrative that can weaken the Tories, broaden the ""overton window"" and shift the centre ground to the left, enough so that their successor can break through the gap that they have created?
* Kendall fails the first factor completely without question, she has shown herself to be completely incapable of critiquing the Tories even when the goals have been wide open. She has given no indication that she is going to change anything about the structure/direction of the party and will just rely on the current obsolete levers we have now, so she fails the second question and she is effectively trying to shift the centre-ground to the right which will just make it easier for the Tories to appeal to their core vote and the swing voters, and make it harder for labour to do it to both. At this point she is a non-entity and she knows it, so she (and the other ""blairites"") have decided to throw a tantrum, throwing their toys out of the pram (something that actually makes labour more unelectable) and just snipe at the other candidates from the side lines. Her stupid comments about putting the country first trying to undermine Andy and take what he said out of context. When she accused (or rather had her supporters do it for her) Yvette of sexism and criticising her for not having a family, when Cooper tried to use her ***personal*** experience as a mother to try to relate to voters/members, something which she should as it is her strongest quality and it is the one of the few ways she can connect with people (particularly swing voters). I am not even going to talk about the behaviour of the blairites regarding Corbyn, because it is so blatantly unacceptable i don't have to, even if you personally are OK with that crap they have been pulling. (I am assuming as you have been overly aggressive with your criticisms of Corbyn, so i can only assume you have some personal vendetta against him, like /u/nifara said)

* Andy/Yvette/Corbyn reasonably pass the first question, Andy opposes but is inconsistent, cooper opposes less but is consistent, Corbyn opposes and is consistent, so he wins this factor by a slight majority. Corbyn wins on building the activists/membership and structures, Andy wins on credible, consistent and popular policies and Yvette wins on increasing perceived competency and standards. Andy wins on creating a narrative that can fight/weaken the Tories, Corbyn wins on broadening the window and Yvette wins on shifting the centre ground.
* At the beginning of the contest (in terms of who I will vote for), the order was Andy in a comfortable first, Yvette coming up on second, Kendall/Umanna a distant but possible third and Corbyn a non-contender. Since then it has changed, Umanna dropped out, Kendall committed seppuku, Andy is focussing too much on Corbyn,giving up creating the narrative and being inconsistent (welfare bill), my support for Yvette however has only dropped once, when she said she would not have Corbyn in her cabinet, even if the membership showed they supported/wanted him there, and would refuse to work with him. Before today, my support was Andy/Yvette closely battling it for first/second place and Corbyn in close third. However, after seeing your comment, annoyed by the sneering/arrogant  tone of your comment/attitude (not quite sure of the words to describe it, I just know that I don't like it and you have disappointed me acting like this, with the comments you have posted here on this sub and on /r/uk) you have made me feel compelled to reply (something I very rarely do) and write all of my thoughts about this down. Writing all of this, has forced me to think more comprehensively of my opinions on the candidates, than I have done previously and was likely to do. In doing this, my opinion has changed, Kendall is still dead last, but Andy/Yvette/Corbyn in my opinion are now very close in first place. I will see how thing change over the next couple of weeks, whether Yvette drops her ridiculous posturing against Corbyn and his supporters, whether Andy becomes more consistent and if Corbyn continues supporting/being inclusive of the broad church of the labour party. But I am leaning towards Jeremy Corbyn as my first and Yvette Cooper as my second, as a result of me having to think this over due to your unnecessarily condescending/patronising attitude towards Corbyn and his supporters.

P.S. I am still curious as to whether you actually think any candidate has a reasonable chance of winning the 2020 election? (even if you are going to be unjustly biased against Corbyn)

Greece doesn't have to accept a single thing the ECB says, they have that democratic option all day long. But the ECB isn't obliged to hand them money because they want it either. What about German democracy? it is in part their money being given away and they don't support it at all.

Basically it's fine unless you happen to live in a public place.

&gt; I know that carrying a knife in pubic is illegal

Not necessarily. I'm not a lawyer, so do your on research rather than relying on what I write, but basically you can carry (in public) an ordinary non-locking folding pocketknife with a cutting edge of no more than three inches for general use (no particular reason) - though some contexts such as football grounds may be a problem (if it's inferred that any knife in such a place is intended as a weapon). You can carry *most* other ordinary knives if you can show that you have a specific lawful Good Reason to do so (note that ""self defence"" is almost never considered a Good Reason here and generally constitutes an admission of carrying an Offensive Weapon (see below)).

This is all subject to the fact that under Offensive Weapons legislation you may not carry anything in public - penknife, stick, avacado, *anything* - that is made, adapted or intended to be a weapon (unless you have a Reasonable Excuse), though in this case the burden is on the prosecution to show it was made/adapted/intended as such.

There are few restrictions (in terms of blades) about what you can have in a non-public place. Some types of knives and blades (including automatic knives, balisongs, non-traditionally-made curved swords) are almost banned - you can't make, import, buy, sell, etc them though possession in private is still legal, you might face questions as to how you obtained them without breaking the law. But if you want to have a rapier\* in the privacy of your home for opening mail, that's fine.

I linked the quotes. 

&gt;Whether Greece is technically in default or not is a moot point.

Greece is not in default, technical or otherwise. This isn't up for debate any more than 2 + 2 equalling 4 is a point for debate.

If Greece is in a position where it's ""democratic"" for the holders of it's national debt to govern instead of MP's then why shouldn't the people who hold British sovereign debt govern instead of the House of Commons? If you think that's democratic in Greece does it mean it's democratic here in Britain? why the double standard?

&gt;1) accept the ECBs conditions and get a loan from them, 2) default and leave the euro, 3) find someone else to lend them the money (Russia maybe).

What gives the ECB the authority to make political demands? Is it a political institution? Is it democratically legitimate? This sounds like a bank blackmailing a sovereign government and operating well outside of it's own remit imo.

&gt;The option they don't have is ""demand people give them money no strings attached""

Another basic factual error to go along with the ""Greece is in default"" one - no-one has ""given"" the Greeks anythings. These are *loans* they get paid back *with interest* (infact the taxpayers of the Eurozone have made something in the region of 1.9 billion euro in profit alone from the interest on Greek bonds.

Because said sovereign parliament wants to borrow money, the conditions aren't on the parliament, they are on the money. It's not like the ECB just came along and said ""right were in charge now, do all these things"" in any random country it feels like.

&gt;Conditions which are political policies, such as privatization. So it's like the Bank of England saying ""we're shutting down the economy unless you agree to our political demands"" which of course are free trade, privatization, austerity, cuts, downward pressure on wages etc.

It's a nightclub in Hereford but they sometimes have more acoustic events. My brother is an acoustic singer songwriter and he's had a few gigs at Play in the past. 


There's also a lovely town about 45 minutes from Hereford called Hay-on-Wye. You might have heard the literature festival that goes on in the town every May. Contact ""The Globe"" in Hay. It's a nice old venue and the best place for live music in the area. I've seen many small bands there and had a great time. Hay has an alternative vibe which is good for small bands like yours. It's also a great town with lots of bookshops. If you get the chance, you should spend some time there. 


If you're interested in more festivals, Herefordshire has some good ones. Nozstock has just finished but I'd contact them to see if you can play there next year, it's a great little festival.

He's been here for almost a decade and been a influential squad player for the past 3-5 seasons. You're right, he could play for other teams and walk into the starting line up (maybe not teams as good at Chelsea but definitely solid teams) but INSTEAD he loves this club, has been here since 2006 and he is still willing to stay and be a bit part player with a specific role. 

I will always respect Mikel because a lot of footballers would be pissed off with riding the bench in and not being allowed to move forward much (he scored his first premier league goal in 13/14 after around 200 appearances) but he knows he has a job and he does it damn well. I have literally never seen him complain about lack of game time or the fact that he only gets to play one way... Just ask yourself how is it Mikel's fault that Jose and other managers rightfully see him as a player who excellently slows down the play of the ball and suffocates teams out of a game? Should he just ignore his managers specific instructions and try and turn into Hazard when he's on the pitch? No... He shouldn't. He is an altruistic clubman who is willing to put aside personal gain and hold leads for our team because that's his job. At the end of the day you may want to see goals but with Mikel on the pitch we don't lose points often and that means we win League titles. 

Also, would you believe a former Nigerian national team manager once criticised Chelsea for ruining Mikel's attacking instinct? In the U20s of 2005 he was rated the second best player behind MESSI and he played offensively... That's just further evidence of how he's changed his game style to suit our clubs needs. 
If you don't like that Jose shuts up shop then just say that but don't call Mikel lazy or a free loader when he's put his entire career into our club (this will be his 10th season) and literally adapted from his natural instincts to fit a defensive system. It's not his fault that managers see his talents as a way of getting a result and specifically instruct him to shut the opposition out. If you rate him on that criteria it's hard to argue that he's anything less than a good player not awful like people around here say. Being not entertaining doesn't mean you're a bad player...

&gt;Inside the Magpie Electricals shop, the proprietor Mr Magpie realises his business is broke as the television behind him finishes its broadcast for the day. Shortly after, a red lightning bolt hits the antenna over the shop. The television comes alive with the TV announcer's face and calls to the dozing Magpie. Within a few seconds the image on the screen lashes out with an energy beam, absorbing Magpie's face.
&gt;The Tenth Doctor and Rose land in Muswell Hill, London, in 1953, yet expecting to be in New York. Dressed in an Elvis Presley mode, they expect to attend a performance of the Ed Sullivan Show. However, the different skyline, a red double-decker bus, and a Union Flag tell them that, actually, they are in northern London on the eve of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.
&gt;By chance, the Doctor witnesses a person covered in a blanket being abducted by men in black. The Doctor and Rose hop on a scooter and race after the car. The car passes through a gated doorway which slams shut and a market stall moves in front of the gate, making it look like a dead end. The Doctor and Rose arrive shortly after, mystified by the car's disappearance.

http://www.scotland.police.uk/access-to-information/freedom-of-information/


I'm not sure how long it takes or costs to receive and answer but I think that it would help with your research and make your book/plot more authentic/ plausible / real.


You could (potentially) request which areas of Edinburgh have the highest number of reported car thefts, or ask for the number of arrests for certain types of crime like car theft or house break-ins etc.


It would be good to have that extra information alongside peoples' personal opinions.


Also maybe have a look through old news articles of incidents of criminal activity. Stv news, the scotsman, evening news and also maybe look on facebook for community pages. ""Tenants and residents in Muirhouse"" facebook page had almost daily posts about house break-ins or youths on stolen motorbikes earlier this year. They were good at providing reasons for things like the why the police helicopter was circling, or alerting folk to where crimes were being commited not long after they'd occurred  - they're kind of like a middle man between the residents and the police.


My personal opinion - the north of Edinburgh is a hot spot for crime. Places like West Pilton, Granton and Muirhouse have problems with drugs, theft, burglary. There are a lot of good people in these areas that are trying to do their best in life and contribute to society. We usually only hear about the negative aspects of what is going on in these areas which gives them a bad reputation- something that might link in with the girl in your book (?)


I hope that helps a little. Sorry if it seems to be a little over the top. I like to be thorough when researching things for myself. It's better to take a bit longer to learn as much as you can about something, makes for a better result :)

Celebs dying always seem to take up 90% of the news coverage for the next few days and Cilla Black is no exception. What fucked me off was during the London Olympics where the BBC were consistently broadcasting it on god knows how many channels all day every day. Yet when the evening news hit 95% of that was dedicated to the olympics. As if all the wars, murders and other current events had ceased temporarily so that they could all watch their countries throw the fucking javelin. I wanted to know what in the fuck was happening outside the Olympic stadium but that information was hard to come by with the BBC. Sure it was the London Olympics, a spectacular event in itself but the BBC's coverage of it took the piss at times when it came to the general news. And don't even get me started on the Beeb's ridiculous coverage of the Royal Family..holy shit.

A lot of people have complained about the lack of world news on the BBC, which is true to extent. Usually when they report foreign news stories they're huge incidents like the Tunisia attack, the Malaysian airplane story and so on and so fourth.

It would make sense if britain was violent before, and the gun laws directly changed that to the current rate, but that isnt what happened.

Ok this is just a stalemate, do you have reason to believe why the SDLP would boycott in otherwise? The poll was being conducted by loyalists.


&gt; Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more.


I already talked about Africa. A quick Google told me that 


&gt; In 16 December 1946, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization assented colonies, such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, to being independent. 


Do you have any more? 


&gt; Everybody knows this Damien but how did bombing a small furniture shop in the Shankill with civilians in it or random bar attacks achieve any of that to name but few. The warnings were bullshite. Someone would of called a newspaper in dublin. The newspaper in dublin called the Gaurds in Ireland then the Gaurds would call the Ruc and by that time the bomb was already off. The ira didn't give two shites about people and only phoned warnings to gain public support.



IRA bombings frequently went off without civilian death because of phoned in warnings. The IRA and British secret service had an agreed upon code to validate threats and then the area was evacuated. I don't know if you think they sent the message by owl or something but three phone calls takes less than a minute and the IRA phoned it in hours before. This was a wholly stupid point


&gt; Why do you keep turning this around on the British army. I have no support for the war in Afghanistan. How is a RUC officer in traffic branch or a British army chef or two pizza delivery men a legitimate target. The IRA thought they were. Only psychopaths think like that Damien.


You said it was sick how I described some IRA's victims as legitmate targets. I used an example of how the most strictly ethical military forces currently active also uses the term 'legitimate target'. The Geneva convention distinguishes between civilians and combatants . This isn't a strange concept but you tried to escalate into me calling innocent people targets, which isn't what happened. Two pizza men aren't legitimate targets but neither were 27 people in Derry. Victims of an organisation you yourself said 'were there to fight for peace'. Do you not see the hypocrisy? If you worked for the British army you were an active part of the armed British colonisation of Ireland and yes then the army of Ireland will target you. That's war. That's how all wars are.

Loans are a form of investment, they are not a charity. Giving is the wrong word. It implies that they're handing over money for nothing, when they're actually making a profit off their loans.

&gt; Also Greece is in default for all intents and purposes, really you need to stop kidding yourself on that one.

Greece is not in default. This is a clear and unequivocal statement of fact. No semantic game playing here. 

&gt;That is a creditor doing what they have to do to get paid

lol I thought they were giving money away just a few sentences ago! Make your mind up. 

The creditors (banks) are profiting from their investments (Greek bonds), not ""giving Greeks money for nothing cos they voted for it"" which is what you were saying not too long ago. 

I really don't think you have even a rudimentary knowledge of the issues at hand due to the constant basic factual errors you've made and mealy-mouthed backtracking you've engaged in throughout our discussion.

You wanna talk semantics? Talking about how Greece being governed by unelected creditors in the troika as being ""democratic"" is semantics. Describing the IMF, Davos, WTO, Eurogroup etc as democratic is semantics. Describing the behaviour of banks seeking profit from Greek debts as ""giving money away"" is semantics. Saying Greece is in default when it isn't (the next bond repayment to the ECB is due on 22nd of August ) is semantics, either that or a) a deliberate lie or b) total ignorance of the issue at hand.

More bullshite from Damo. Theres no evidence for that 


&gt;IRA bombings frequently went off without civilian death because of phoned in warnings. The IRA and British secret service had an agreed upon code to validate threats and then the area was evacuated. I don't know if you think they sent the message by owl or something but three phone calls takes less than a minute and the IRA phoned it in hours before. This was a wholly stupid point


Then why were some phone calls late? A simple life lesson is that if you don't want to kill anyone you don't plant bombs. Simple

The IRA thought so.

LOL. You have to laugh at your thought process. Ok. How many people were planted between 1969-2005.

null,null,LukeeT,null,null,null,"Here's the way i saw it and first off Hindsight is 20/20 so I'm not blaming our tactics really. The reason we played badly is partly down to Arsenal not playing well and not playing their normal attacking but possession based selves. My point of view is to never be scared into playing 3 in the midfield, but i often underrate Arsenal and to be honest most teams get dominated in the centre of the park against them, so 3 midfield is a fair precaution to take i guess.  

So, we played 3 in the middle of the park to squash their possession dominance and specifically make sure the whole between the midfield and defence was filled with the likes of Matic and Ramires as thats where Arsenals main threat is, especially with Sanchez out and Ozil looking good preseason. Also having a deeper more packed midfield reduces the likelihood of Walcott getting 1v1 against Terry or worse, in behind him, as midfielders have less time to pick the perfect pass for him and less space to aim at.  

Anyway, as Arsenal really weren't anything to shout about, they sat deeper, we had more possession in their third than expected. Fabregas was slow and yes Hazard looked tired / double marked but we had one less attacking midfielder than normal and so with Arsenal playing ""our"" counter-attacking style, we were left to play against a tightly packed well-performing defence with the creative Oscar swapped out for Ramires who wont exactly carve out opportunities in those situations as he doesn't really have the ""flair"".  

Again I love Remy, think he deserves a chance, but at the risk of agreeing with Michael bloody Owen too much, you can use him as a scape goat to a little extent (BEING HARSH HERE).

Your son has already lost his cousin.

Their relationship will not be repaired by his self-sacrficial restraint.

I am in litigation over a family matter at the moment, in slightly different circumstances. If I were confronted over my decision to see a solicitor, I would just be apologetic and explain I thought it necessary to ""just to get everything sorted out legally and above board"".

I actually find the language of solicitors' letters quite amicable and reassuring - ""our client is concerned that …""  and ""we hope you can clarify"" and so on. The na'er-do-well has every opportunity, in fact, to make a friendly agreement. 

My mother went through something more similar to your son's case than mine - when my gran needed money for a residential care, my uncle came up with an agreement that he'd fund it in exchange for taking over the business, and then my mother and aunt would be compensated from the estate after my gran's death. I can't remember the details, but my mother knew it was a bad deal, but was pressured by the fact that both her brother and sister had already agreed it and she was the only one that remained standing in the way.

My aunt and uncle have not rewarded my mother's acquiescence - since my grandmother's death they have just stopped pretending to give a shit, and the distance of their relationships have just become more apparent with time.

It's a highly acclaimed book written with incredible amounts of objectivity for someone so involved. The book is purely descriptive of actual events, there is no bias.

&gt; More bullshite from Damo. Theres no evidence for that


http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fref70s.htm


The referendums were conducted by the British government. A British government vowing to destroy the IRA and keep Northern Ireland in the Union. SDLP had every right to be suspicious. 


&gt; Then why were some phone calls late? A simple life lesson is that if you don't want to kill anyone you don't plant bombs. Simple


The response to the phone calls were late, or delayed. The phone calls were made before the explosions.


&gt; The IRA thought so.


No they didn't? They still killed civilians, nobody is doubting that, but you're missing the entire point here. Nobody is saying 100% of the people the IRA killed were legitimate targets but they had a very low rate of civilian death. Every active military force that has ever existed has killed civilians. 


&gt; LOL. You have to laugh at your thought process. Ok. How many people were planted between 1969-2005. You seem to forget that the majority of Northern Ireland sees the British Army as their army not some angry farmers. It would be different if we were all on your side Damien but we're not. The majority isn't


Again, more from your very absurd ability to misunderstand the basic concept of a legitimate target. Nobody said that plantations were legitimate targets, civilians never are. British army members are, which is why the IRA targeted them. How many times am I going to need to repeat this?  


&gt; Oh so did the Taoiseach give the IRA his blessing. Haha army of ireland. Jesus Damien you should write some mythology books. For now anyway Damien I'm done. Maybe next time we speak you may not support mass murder.

Pretty much yes

&gt;I have seen most of Liverpool's transfers this window on B/R before they were official

Because they'll post literally anything and everything. Of course some of the rumors are gonna be right. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

In terms of the Lacazette rumor, for example, they're just reposting a rumor from ""Fichajes.net"", which appears to be a Spanish rumors site. Not any kind of reliable source at all. It's best to stick to the few journalists who actually have some connections at the club and can speak with some authority. 

It also doesn't make much logical sense. Lambert's gone, but even IF Balo also goes, we still have Benteke, Sturridge, Ings, and Origi.  Last year Rodgers was content with just Studge, Balo, and Lambert (remember, he wanted Borini to leave), so I don't see why with four strikers, three of which just recently joined the club, Rodgers would be ""desperate"" to add yet another.

Furthermore, Yaya Toure is great at beating players one-on-one, has a great shot, has great strength and decent pace. None of these are Bentaleb's strenghts (I am still optimistic about his shooting though). Of course Bentaleb can evolve into a different player, but at the moment Ryan Mason has more in common with Yaya than Bentaleb does.
