He would have had much higher expectations too. The club, media and fans would expect him to take us into the Champions League from the word go, even though that won't happen with our current squad. It would have been pain and misery all round, or just very spursy.

Poch on the other hand seems to want to build a destiny of some sorts. He is looking to our academy rather than paying over the odds for relative unknowns from Europe. It wouldn't have been a surprise to have seen Van Gaal wanting us to make a few landmark signings over the off season to show him our intent to challenge and we'd have the same problem all over again when it inevitably backfires; the team can't play to his, the media and our expectations, similar to what AVB had and what Poch has now inherited. We've tried that, it's time to give a manager time and see if it yields fruit. The hangover from the Champions League season needs to come to an end. Everything from our expectations to how we react at the games needs to change. 

Don't forget, if all goes well, Poch will likely see in the new stadium which is a big fucking deal. Over the next couple of seasons he has the opportunity to lay the ground work for what we all want to see, a successful Spurs side playing out of a state of the art facility in the heart of Tottenham. 

I'm not going to lie and as much we'll all loath the comparison, I want Poch to be our Wenger (the twat). Stability, good football and importantly, entertainment.

My view is that he usually finds Lucas or Henderson when their in loads of space in the middle, it's not often he goes long or wide to Moreno on the left.

My point was most of the passes were simple, and they are. It's not his job to go long or find through balls, it's his job to find Hendo and Lucas who are open in the midfield.

I am of the school of thought that Cahill is a very good defender. He is good in the air, he does quite well when he goes to ground, and reads the game quite well in terms of blocks. However, he has his limitations.

Although he's similar to Terry in that he's brave and throws himself in front of everything, scores the odd goal, and is reasonably comfortable on the ball, I feel he lacks the tactical acumen that Terry possesses with a similar skill set. Even now with Terry's rapidly declining pace, for the most part he's very good at timing when to step in and make that challenge as he's dropping off. 

I understand that with a player like Sterling or Gayle who will burn just about everyone for pace that you can't dive in or you'll be left for dead, but giving them 3 yards and dropping off so you don't get burned isn't a legitimate solution either. 

Zouma isn't ready either, he makes errors, but he's young and learning and attempts to remedy them. He dropped off too often in the first half at Newcastle, did well to get a few blocks, but wasn't getting close enough. Second half he went through ball, man, and took everything just about every time. 

My issue with Cahill is his inability to adapt and iron out those kinks, it's the same problem all season, and most of last.

Regardless, really hope he finds some form, I still quite like him, even if I do think he's dog shite so far this season.",null,0,null,1422209434,null,0,false,0,co0ebcv,null,t3_2tlzj7,null,t1_co0ebcv,null,t3_2tlzj7,null,null,null,1424398322,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

Because I'm lazy and I'm going out in a sec for a fat-boy Burger King tea, here's the stats from Wikipedia. If they're dogshit, ignore them. 

USA - 12.6% of the population in 2010 were African American. 

UK - 3% of the population in 2011 were black or black British. 

That's obviously a very quick comparision but it's a pretty huge difference and because of that I'd expect there to be more opportunities for black actors in the US. We're totally different cultures with totally different demographics, of course things are going to be different.

Not according to the statistics for anti-Muslim hate crime. I think speaking out against hate in all it's forms is a good idea, and peace can only come from opening dialogue with all parties no matter how extreme, as was shown with the end of the troubles.

You claim that British society's issue with Muslims are minor, but I have witnessed ~13 years of warfare and rhetoric almost entirely aimed at Islamic countries.

null,false,badumfiara,num1,,null,"Thats a very trivial thing to say, 'get the best out of someone'. When it comes to Soldado and Ade, theres not much more a manager can do.. Soldado has been given opportunities on a plate and still managed to fluff it, you cant expect a manager to babysit him now can you? Same with Ade, he plays when he wants, we all knew this. Only reason he played for Tim was because he was brought back to the first team. With no contract extension or being played in the reserves in sight, he'll play how he wants. 

One of the key components to making pochs philosophy work is believing in him. I followed him very closely when he came to Southampton.. and thats what you saw, every player giving it their all (from the young ones like ward prowse to oldies like lambert) because they believed. 

One of the main reasons for him choosing youth (and hes said this before) is that its easier to instill this belief in them. They will be more willing to listen to him, and to apply his philosophy from the heart. For a person like Ade or Kaboul, whos seen a decent number of managers in his career, this is just ONE more guy with a bunch of new tactics. Plus the whole levy trigger finger thing might be keeping older players (kaboul, lennon, maybe even dembele by now) skeptical about how long this current manager will stay, so why bother diving in head first? 

As for the midfield trio, its stamboulis first year and he doesnt play regularly. Dembele and Paulinho have been shadows of their selves and I would argue they have been since before he arrived. 

Only thing about Poch that I have to say is a negative are his signings. They were not very impressive at Espanyol, especially not at southampton (ramirez was their biggest ever transfer at that point iirc). 

edit: I really dont know on what basis you're demanding a great manager. I would argue frank de boer (the highest regarded from among the bunch spoken about last time round apart from lvg) was a good option, but again only a good option. Currently tottenham arent a club thats very attractive to a 'great' manager.

&gt;Are countries like Sweden under threat? Is there any risk of them losing their sovereignty?

Well yes Russia has been testing there borders recently as a result they are looking to [strengthen ties with nato as a result](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/finland-sweden-strengthen-ties-nato)

&gt;Taiwan doesn't have nukes but has China breathing down its neck. Will China bomb them and invade?

Its defiantly a possibility china has been putting its neighbours  territory to the test recently, [for example putting an oil rig in veatnames waters](http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/learning-from-chinas-oil-rig-standoff-with-vietnam/). I could easily see a maritime boundary dispute escalating. If Taiwan had nukes china wouldn't dare touch them, but unfortunately they don't so china will likely continue to step up the pressure to ensure they comply with chinas interests in the area.

&gt;Has having nuclear submarines saved us in the past?

In conjunction with the US arsenal yes, see the cold war.

&gt;Where are our nuclear warheads maintained and serviced?

[HMNB Clyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMNB_Clyde) Though the missiles them them self's (excluding the war heads) are serviced by the US.

&gt;Do we currently have an independent nuclear deterrent that doesn't rely on the US?

Mostly we still rely on the US to service the missile launch systems, all though i expect we could make do if it was required. However the US doesn't have the ability to prevent the UK launching its missiles, it could just refuse to service them, meaning over time they may become faulty, unless we did it our selfs.

&gt;What would be more beneficial to the future of our country: A) £150 billion spent on a nuclear deterrent that ""protects"" us but has never had and never will have any practical advantages. B) £150 billion spent on transforming the economy by investing more in our public services and education system.

Balotelli is with Rodgers every single day and Rodgers is telling him what he told Suarez and Sturridge and Borini and Lambert. All of those players can press pretty effectively, of course some more than others. It's not rocket science. Balotelli clearly isn't listening to Rodgers or is just plain stupid. It's clearly the former.

I said before we signed him that it was never a good fit. Even though most people were excited of his arrival, he couldn't be further away from a typical Rodgers signing. I'm still staggered that we bought him when there were much better strikers out there and we knew months before the summer window opened that Suarez was going and Sturridge was injury prone.

null,false,walgman,english,London,null,"Here in Mexico it's acceptable to engage with children in the street. When I'm in the UK I try not to look at them. I had a nasty experience in Weymouth last year. I was walking round taking photos of the town when a group of kids came up and asked my name. I gave them my first name and all hell broke loose. I was being called a pedo in the street. Luckily there were some police nearby so I sought help. The kids were being pretty abusive and were spitting and screaming at me by this time. I was put into the car and checked out. I have no criminal record but I wasn't free to go. The police demanded I let them see the pictures and see my recent text messages. As an ex cameraman I'm acutely aware of my rights which I pointed out. The police acknowledged they had no right to demand but gave me the choice, 'arrested and taken to the station on suspicion or I show them my phone'. I showed them my phone. Nothing on it other than some pictures of old pubs and the harbour. 

Anyway the police said I had to be taken back to the hotel for my own safety since about 50 children had built up the other side of the road. The policewoman said this happens quite a lot in Weymouth because the children have pedos banged into their heads since primary school. In her words, they see every stranger as a predator. 

When an innocent man has to be escorted back to his hotel for his own safety on the will of some fucking sick minded children our society is broken and I don't think it can be fixed.

Landlines are NOT 'technology' - they are nothing more than copper cables. Its whats on either end that is technology.

Line rental (what we are talking about) is pays for the infrastructure that allows us to receive broadband (service). Many of you are too young to remember mobile phone line rentals and how they worked. You paid a fixed cost a month for the network access, then payed per text/minute. Later the networks realised that selling a fixed number of minutes a month, more often than not under utilised meaning they can drop the line rental fee and still make profits. Hence why today you don't see line rental but the infrastructure costs are still there. 

Back to landlines, we are at a point where someone needs to pay to maintain the cables and physical infrastructure to the homes - but nobody wants to pay. Who wants to pay the £1000s it costs to repair the cable for a few homes? What about investment? Who wants to pay the billions to bring anything faster than ADSL2 to homes?

Landlines are NOT about phone numbers or minutes anymore, its about access to the services such as a phone service or more importantly broadband. Phone numbers are free.

Its great marketing that you don't need line rental with Virgin but at the end of your bill, It's all still factored in and quite honestly not much cheaper than if you had JUST broadband. Heck Plus Net is as cheap as £10 a month for unlimited broadband. 

Line rental is a necessary evil with none of the broadband providers wanting to get into the business of maintaining infrastructure. 
The current system allows pretty much anyone with enough capital to start a broadband business.

In the end its a copper cable and your internet isn't going to get magically cheaper. ",null,0,null,1422211253,null,0,false,0,co0f9d1,null,t3_2tlz1o,null,t1_co0f9d1,null,t3_2tlz1o,null,null,null,1424397882,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

She came over on a ""Working Holiday"" Visa. [24 month visa, of which you can be in employmenet for 12 of them]

Towards the end of that, we applied for a ""Permission to Marry"" and then a ""spouse visa"".

that took us to 4 years residency, at which point she applied for ""indefinite leave to remain"", and eventually citisenship..

I believe the rules have now changed for ""indefinite leave to remain"" requiring 5 years, but you can apply for the spouse visa to be extended, bringing up the required residency time.

edit - also very important - keep bank statements, council tax, everything. - you'll probably need to prove residency for each and every month of that 5 years.

&gt;I want to say, and this is very important: at the end we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war at the end. Rational individuals: Kennedy was rational; Khrushchev was rational; Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies. And that danger exists today.

&gt;The major lesson of the Cuban missile crisis is this: the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will destroy nations. Is it right and proper that today there are 7500 strategic offensive nuclear warheads, of which 2500 are on 15 minute alert, to be launched by the decision of one human being?

&gt;It wasn't until January, 1992, in a meeting chaired by Castro in Havana, Cuba, that I learned 162 nuclear warheads, including 90 tactical warheads, were on the island at the time of this critical moment of the crisis. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, and Castro got very angry with me because I said, ""Mr. President, let's stop this meeting. This is totally new to me, I'm not sure I got the translation right."" 

&gt;""Mr. President, I have three questions to you. Number one: did you know the nuclear warheads were there? Number two: if you did, would you have recommended to Khrushchev in the face of an U.S. attack that he use them? Number three: if he had used them, what would have happened to Cuba?""

&gt;He said, ""Number one, I knew they were there. Number two, I would not have recommended to Khrushchev, I did recommend to Khrushchev that they be used. Number three, 'What would have happened to Cuba?' It would have been totally destroyed."" That's how close we were.


I'm not entirely sure I agree, because in the end rationalism did prevail. We're not a smoking crater..

If al Quaida or IS had parliamentary wings within their movements dedicated to peaceful reform through non-violent means then the Greens might - just might - have a point, even if these organisations' ends remained the same.

But the fact is that these are terrorist cells who regularly recruit and indoctrinate young people to go and blow themselves up in order to advance their medieval ideologies. They are purely violent organisations with abhorrent objectives.

And while I agree that education is perhaps the most effective way of combating these groups that's hardly an argument against banning membership of them. The only convincing arguments that can be made against their outlawing are: a) that it exacerbates the problem of radicalisation (which no one has shown) and b) that it's an infringement on freedom of expression, but then you'd have an argument as to why it should be okay for someone to join an organisation that advocates suicide bombing and mass slaughter. You'd also have a job arguing against all the other curtailments of free expression that are there in order to ensure public safety, e.g. incitement to violence (which membership of the aforementioned groups is tantamount to).

null,false,whistling_unicorn,null,null,null,"OK, to understand this properly you need to know two key things that are very different with roads in the UK and USA.

Firstly the majority of roads in the UK are centuries if not millennia old, even if we are not actually driving the exact same road (which in many cases we are) if you compare the [roman roads map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_Roads_in_Britannia.svg) to [the motorway map](http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/gbmwayhr.jpg) then you can see that our basic road network was established between 2000 and 1500 years ago. 

The second thing is that a lot more people in the UK live in what would be considered rural areas in the USA. Because we're so much more compact than the USA lots of little villages and towns have become commuter towns to larger cities and towns and because we restrict building so much (in order to protect our ever dwindling countryside) they do not become annexed into larger cities like they do in the USA, and people who live in these little villages and towns like how rural they seem. 

So basically both of these things have lead to a country that *fucking hates* building new roads.

Now a bypass generally aims to take through traffic away from a town centre and around the outskirts, to stop congestion in the centre of the town. This pisses off 1) the people who live in the countryside 2) Most people who are completely unaffected, because as I said, people just hate new roads, 3) businesses in the town who get less passing traffic.

The only people it makes happy is people who don't live in the town but have to travel past the town, so they are often protested against by everyone who lives in or around said town.

**Zouma** - Promising talent, but still very raw. Though he may have the raw skill, he has nowhere near the chemistry that Cahill/Terry have, and it is difficult to see Jose putting Zouma in a position of such pressure this early in his career. 

**Christensen** - Again, way too young, raw, not really an option.

The standard of video evidence has to be high, and you need continuity - the footage needs to be seized, and a good lawyer will quibble every little point regarding timestamps, digital manipulation etc. It's more complex than you would imagine, and can take up a good few hours. This puts the officer in the position of having to decide which is better for the public, sorting out the technicalities of all that to create a charge the CPS might not go with anyway, or actually being out on patrol and capturing footage of other offences themselves (much simpler to process as everything is already streamlined)

Either option could be correct, but whichever the officer chooses someone will potentially have an issue with it.

&gt; That's why such efforts are put into the IAEA preventing the expansion of the nuclear weapons club and things like the Iraq War happened. No one wants Iran to develop nukes, for example.

No, you don't. Disarmament means ""reduction or withdrawal of military forces and weapons"". Renewing Trident isn't a reduction or withdrawal, so it's doesn't count as disarmament.

Ok, do you honestly think, between working a fulfilling job that boosts ones confidence in themselves and is social acceptable, or living below the breadline when the only way out it through some form of deviance, they'd choose the second option? 

These statements you're spouting completely ignores the problems we have with the job market and our tripartite system of education that causes breakdowns in children who either don't care or who care too much. You are completely ignoring how much the system is against someone who is born into a non privileged position. It's a long, agonising road for a someone to end up as a 'dosser'. 

What about those with mental illnesses such as bipolar depression, anxiety disorders or undiagnosed negative schizophrenia? Or maybe those with a bad upbringing, either through physical, emotional or sexual abuse? 

If we look at the main reasons these people are 'frauding the system' by *helping* them then they may end up not wanting to off themselves and contribute in a way *you* and all others with your beliefs find acceptable huh?

Have a look at violent crime stats over the same period. Guns are a tool that do get used in violence but overall violent crime has fallen. Also, compare violent crimes per capita in the UK and US and you see that an armed society is a polite society.

&gt; And if the lunatic happens to be in charge of one of the states that currently have nuclear weapons?

Like North Korea? Even they haven't used nukes. If you think the US or the UK is likely to kick off nuclear armageddon, then you're a moron. 

&gt; Disarmament means ""reduction or withdrawal of military forces and weapons"".

And how do you think you achieve that? By giving up all of yours first to set a good example? That would lead to an arms race as states attempt to fill the power vacuum. The only way to achieve disarmament is by the most powerful convincing everyone else that they won't use their WMD against others first whilst providing sufficient incentives for other states to disarm.

There are clearly some mods on Reddit who are hogging the top spots of the largest subreddits and doing naff all work, but when it comes to mods being dickheads, you never really know what the other guy has done. 

Mods have to act arbitrarily - it's not possible to have a fair trial, presumption of innocence and a jury of your peers for this stuff - and everyone who experiences a mod action thinks it's unfair.

Mods hate discussing their actions because they don't know if you're a time-wasting wanker or just someone who's made an honest mistake, but if they explain their actions then there's a very good chance that the user will try to waste an hour of their time (which they're not paid for) arguing the point.

I really don't know that it's the mod ""personality type"" so much as it's the nature of the job. If someone becomes a mod because they want to have a positive effect on the forum, then they're confronted with the trolls and their actions, and it can be very hard to distinguish those from genuine users.

Obviously that depends how you define ""trolls"" and ""genuine users"", but forum users cover a wide spectrum of those who are intentionally disruptive, those who think things should be done differently, those who want to push some particular point of view, all the way to those who're just having a bad day or who have made a genuine mistake.

&gt; No, no, no. He isn't anywhere near world class at the moment, maybe in FIFA, but not in real life.

He isn't anywhere near the quality a club like Chelsea need when it comes to playing an important role for us.
He is better than Salah, but not good enough to consistently start for us, not in the slightest. I said a comment just like this about Salah before he signed and I am saying it again now. Cuadrado is a 100x better option for us. I hope this only a plan to be a ploy to get a better bargain for Cuadrado.
I don't know what is going on in the transfer room at Chelsea but going after these sub-par players has to stop. Douglas Costa, Salah, Atsu, Marin, Moses, etc. These guys are not bad, but you can't just bring them in and realistically expect them to suddenly become world class, especially if they are hardly tearing apart their own leagues let alone the PL. If we really want to bring in someone lesser known we should be going after someone like Brahimi, who is consistently showing at Porto the potential to be world class.

In short, this current fees system is a giant contradictory mess that helps no-one. The government aren't saving money and students have the added burden of a gigantic debt.

a. The streetview image you link to at https://goo.gl/maps/Gqrm3 shows **zero** cycle lanes.  We can see two eastbound road lanes at the left, then a tram-only eastbound lane, and then two westbound road lanes (which cyclists are expected to use because there's no separate cycle lane at this point) with westbound tram tracks entering/crossing them at a shallow angle.

If we turn around 180 degrees from the view you posted, you can see that a cycle lane STARTS some way ahead, with a cycle and an arrow painted on the main road carriageway to indicate where it starts.  You'll note the presence of the tram lines in that section of road (and no, tram lines are not used as markers for the edges of cycle lanes, ever).

b. People use road bikes to travel on roads, it's surprisingly logical and the clue is in the name.  I still don't understand what significance you think the name Athens of the North has with relation to cycling.

c. Very pretty map. It doesn't get away from the fact that sometimes people travel from point A to point B, when neither point is on the national cycle network.  Imagine, for example, that you are a cyclist currently located at the junction of Morrison Street and Lothian Road, and you wish to travel to Haymarket Station so that you can travel on a train.  What route do you take? Exactly.

As to your routes, all three are eastbound, and thus not exactly great demonstrations...

If I take either of https://goo.gl/maps/740F6 or https://goo.gl/maps/HFYEB and click the button to reverse directions, it directs me along the* exact route* we saw in the video where the cyclist crashed thanks to the poorly placed tram lines.

If I take your first route, and again reverse direction so that it's actually westbound, then the first route it offers does indeed miss out the troublesome road section - but only because it thinks the alternate route in that case is quicker.  It still offers a second route, which yet again takes us over that infamous section of road/tram.",null,0,null,1422220186,null,0,false,0,co0k4gd,null,t3_2tekhj,null,t1_co0k4gd,null,t1_cnzyabe,null,null,null,1424395612,null,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2,null

Perhaps. The problem is how you define 'terrorism'.  
If you use the dictionary [definition](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define+terrorist&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=SFnFVJeYGMr3UrPXg9AH#q=define+terrorism) then you get something rather vague like ""the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims"". But a definition like that could easily make some of the UK actions in Northern Ireland looks distinctly terroristy, which would mean that anyone supporting the government would also be a terrorist supporter. And governments don't generally like being thought of as terrorists (a viewpoint lacking in historical context given the [original definition](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=terrorism&amp;searchmode=none) of terrorism.  
So what 'terrorist' ends up meaning is ""people we say are terrorists"". And once you get to that state of affairs then the list begins to look considerably more arbitrary.

Risk analysis. Most likely outcomes. Known unknowns. Unknown knowns. We plan as best we can based on an uncertain future.

&gt; Thanks for calling me a moron, btw. It's nice when a debate requires straw men and ad-hominem arguments to gain ground. Maybe you're not quite as sure of the quality of your arguments as your bluster might have you believe? 

Read what I said again:

&gt; &gt; If you think the US or the UK is likely to kick off nuclear armageddon, then you're a moron. 

I didn't call you a moron. I said if you believe that the US or UK was about to launch MAD you are a moron. The only reason anyone would launch MAD is if they wanted everyone else to die more than they wanted to stay alive. That's why it is so important to keep nukes away from the crazies in the Middle East. The UK and the US would never do that, but if Iraq had nukes and ISIL got hold of them? All bets are off.

&gt; keeping weapons isn't disarmament but a perpetuation of the status quo

As already explained, security and trust are necessary for disarmament to occur. Some has already occurred but geopolitics have since changed. Giving up weapons carte blanche just creates a power vacuum and if done unilaterally it leads to an arms race as actors try to fill that vacuum.

&gt; [How will nukes be decommissioned?] By negotiated settlement, the same way existing disarmament has been undertaken

Which requires the conditions I've specified above. 

&gt; If you want to talk about credulity let's talk about having enough explosive power to kill pretty much everything on planet and calling that 'peace'.

MAD works so long as all parties believe the others to be acting in sane self-interest. No one wants to be first to push the button. Especially not a capitalist democracy. Beliefs like Communism or Religion complicate that however as they remove the self interest and the sanity from the equation as the ends are seen to justify the means.

**Heal: Hymn of the Eleventh Lyrics**

Something's different, something's changed

I'm a child rearranged

Ten lives stacked in your head; 

It's something strange


I make a friend, leave her behind

Come back and we start running blind

She's fierce, I'm free

We're getting on just fine


What a pair,

the storyteller and a thief

What's to steal 

when all you've got is grief


Chorus:
I am the storm

A god concealed

And I am all the things you never thought were real

I'm here to help

A brace and shield

But even with the name of Doctor

I can never heal


My dreamer and her soldier man

I knew them like my own two hands

They make me less a monster, 

More a man


My mystery girl

She picks me up

Through centuries she tells me run

Because she knows I always need someone


Someone to hush the rage

The darkness lock it down

And I have come to far

To stumble now


[Chorus]


Lost and found that's all my friends

But now coming to the end

I know the best of me remains in them


I know change is constant

But I make this promise

To count the stars the years, the names and not forget


I'm made of dreams

And not of steel

But I know every moment,

Every face was real


I'm skin and hearts

And I can feel

And since I have the name of Doctor

I will always heal


Oh, there's so much I can feel

And since I have the name of Doctor I will always heal


Paid my dues and did my time

I feel the fire, you'd best hold tight

The hour striking twelve

Nope. Not even sure how you think that can possibly work. There are two very different demographics between the home and away support. It's also a very different environment. 

The home support _has_ had the chance. Two campaigns, one of which was organised by a friend of mine, and without someone holding people's fucking hands the singing stops. 

If people care about the atmosphere at the ground? They sing. If they don't they sit there not singing then go online and moan about it.

Unless you are like Reus, Robben, Ronaldo, Bale, etc, and have a deadly shooting ability, where you cut in from isn't very important. Its about what you can do when you cut in.

You think when Hazard is on the right he magically loses his ability to cut into the field, or even is hindered by it? Not in the slightest.

I don't know how it really could have been, really. She looked like someone who couldn't defend a central plank of her own party's manifesto.

&gt;I don't see why she should be expected to speculate on what the precise numbers might be off the top of her head before they've been actually calculated.

With an issue as contentious as the Citizen's Income- something so expensive that it would cost *three times as much as the NHS, every single year*, ""how are you going to pay for it?"" is a perfectly legitimate question. 

It's not unreasonable to have the expectation that the party would have a significantly broader, somewhat valid *vague guess* of how they're going to make up those sums- particularly when it's this outlandish. 

Nobody is expecting down-to-the-penny estimates- but she didn't seem to have *any* reasonable clue of how it could actually, feasibly, be afforded. It's no damned good to have a policy without even knowing if it's even remotely possible- you might as well pledge to legislate away the colour purple.

&gt;I don't watch this show, but I can only hope that all party leaders are given similar grillings.

They are. It's a common thing. 

The difference with the major leaders, of course, is that they have a better handle on their own policies- and that they've made sure that the policies in question can actually be defended.

Being a Presbyterian I do have an affinity for them, some people would say that Presbyterians were treated worse than Catholics, but I'm not read up enough in the specifics.

A group of young Orangemen went down to Cork a couple of years ago to learn about it and I did quite enjoy it dispute the freezing cold.

Their initial goals of emancipation of Catholics and Dissenters were perfectly valid and oddly enough achieved shortly after the rebellion albeit in an entirely different way from how they wanted it to happen, by full integration to the UK. However the actions of them at Wexford, and Dromore (where Presbyterians were largely the perpetrators) were to be the undoing of their support amongst Protestants.
The political thinking was not uncommon at the time, drawing great influence from the French revolution (indeed the French sent troops and equipment) and the American revolution (Another story of Ulster Presbyterians) which in turn shows the influence of the Liberal thinker John Locke and 1689 Bill of Rights.

Which brings us nicely round to the Glorious Revolution and William of Orange. Some 3 years previous to the rebellion and as what was a running theme there were sectarian attacks across Ulster at the time, when one Protestant heard word of an impending attack he sent word to his friends and other Protestants to come to his aid. And using the rights afforded to them by the Bill of Rights they successfully defended themselves and formed a society to celebrate their liberties given to them by the great and glorious King William and to support and protect each other. This caught on lodges sprung up across Ireland. Many of these lodges were formed into militias and yeomanry by the local gentry  come 1798 and they marched south to fight the French and their traitorous countrymen. I have no idea the levels of dissenters in the early orange order, but I doubt they had the same level as it does now.

Upon the battle lines being drawn there are reports of members of an Ulster militia literally turning their coats inside out and joining the other side. Could their be a case of an Orangeman and a united Irishman? Possibly, doubtfully, and impossible to ascertain.

So there's an odd sort of parallel to them.

Chelsea Football Club, as a whole, goes absolutely monkeypoo and starts murdering people willy nilly. Half of the fans decide to start supporting Arsenal, and the other half decide that there's nothing quite like being a true blue, and back their team like they always have. As a result, the remaining Chelsea fans get rounded up and jailed for being terrorists, despite never having committed any crimes themselves.

Would this be just?

Onto a more relevant situation. How 'right' is murder and brutality? What reasons does it need to be for to become acceptable? Clearly there are situations in which it is acceptable, because we didn't come out of the second world war all bothered about how many innocent Germans we killed. America didn't pull out of the second world war calling themselves monsters for completely wiping out two whole cities full of innocent people. People have reasons for everything. Whether they're the right reasons or the wrong reasons all depends on which side of the situation you're sitting on. I would imagine most Americans cheered after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Are they evil? Would each and every one of them deserve to be locked away for cheering on the single most devastatingly huge mass murder of innocent people in the 20th century?

I think not. I think the Americans of the '40's were, and still are, totally innocent of any wrongdoing. Questionable, sure, but innocent all the same. I think we were right to come out of WW2 triumphantly waving our flags because we remained free from German occupation, regardless of how many innocent Germans we bombed to get that. In wars, lives are lost. Most of those lives are the lives of the innocent. We lost plenty our own innocent lives to the blitz, among many other German raids.

So why is that a relevant thing? I'm talking about war, surely, while terrorism isn't war. Actually, terrorism *is* war. Terrorism isn't a war between 2 countries, but war between a small faction and a larger population. Terrorism also tends to lend itself to being a buzzword. A label attached to 'anything we don't like'. Recently it was claimed that 9/11 conspiracy theorists are now defined as terrorists. To the best of my knowledge, questioning an official document isn't the same as slaying people for having different beliefs, yet as 'terrorists' (who haven't attempted to kill anyone) surely that means they'd have to lose their freedom under the very same rules that take away freedoms from people who actually have committed terrorism. Ironically, if we had the death sentence in place for terrorism, it would be us slaying people for having different beliefs, thus making us no better than actual terrorists when we deal with mere 'sympathisers'.",null,0,null,1422223208,null,0,false,0,co0lrku,null,t3_2tmv3m,null,t1_co0lrku,null,t3_2tmv3m,null,null,null,1424394776,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Let's see if I can put an answer to your question together without putting myself in an awkward position:

- If you're asking if females go to meetups, the answer is yes.
- If you're asking if any of the ladies that turned up yesterday are 'nubile' (Which by the way, is an odd choice of terminology), I prefer not to answer. I don't think it's fair/decent to ""rate"" people in that manner. So I'll just abstain from casting my opinion on this point.
- If you're asking if meetups are a good place to meet 'someone special', I'd say, probably not, because most people that come are more likely to be interested in making friends than finding a relationship.

&gt;__Chesterfield Parish Church__ is an [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism) church dedicated to [Saint Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary) and All Saints, located in the town of [Chesterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield) in Derbyshire, England. Predominantly dating back to the 14th century, the church is a [Grade I listed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_I_listed_building) and is most known for its twisted spire, an architectural phenomenon which has led to the church being given the common byname of the __Crooked Spire__. The largest church in Derbyshire, it lies within the [Diocese of Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Derby), in which it forms part of the Archdeaconry of Chesterfield.

It's a problem that could literally be solved today if every single person decided to stop voting tactically and actually be honest. So it won't be solved any time soon, but that isn't an excuse to be a part of the problem.

You could vote Respect, Pirate, Loony Party for all I care- all of them would be more morally correct choices than the ""lesser evil"" approach.

null,false,Froggerella,eng-merseyside,Merseyside,null,"Absolutely.  I recently had an incident where a guy accused me of cutting him off at a roundabout.  Now, I don't believe I did, as he hadn't even reached the roundabout at the junction before mine when I was pulling out, and the car parallel to me (going across the roundabout rather than first exit like me) pulled out at the same time - showing that I obviously wasn't the only one to judge it to be clear.  The guy was simply going far too fast, which is how he ended up very close behind me as we were pulling off the roundabout.

However, regardless of whether I made a mistake or not - let's face it, most people make honest mistakes while driving - his actions following this cannot be excused.  He began tailgating me.  I also kept slowing down, trying to get the message across that this wasn't ok.  After a couple of times of me doing that, I realised he was fully intending to intimidate me by tailgating me, and so I stopped slowing down in order to avoid any further risk.

When we reached the next roundabout, I was in the left hand lane to take the first exit, and he drove into the right hand lane alongside me.  At that point, he began shouting and gesturing to me through the window... and then as I was pulling out onto the roundabout, he swerved in front of me, causing me to emergency brake, and the car behind me to do the same.

If my reflexes hadn't been quick enough, I would have gone into his passenger side door due to the angle at which he swerved in front of me.  He then proceeded to get out of his car - on a busy roundabout, which his car was now blocking fully - and came over to scream at me through my window (I locked the doors as soon as I saw him get out of his car) and punch my car.  

He was a fairly large man, and he saw that I'm a fairly small woman on my own at the time - so easy to threaten, it would seem.

Luckily, I got his reg number.  Furthermore, the driver behind me came up to me after this guy had got back in his car and sped off, and gave me her details to act as a witness for the police - she described it as the worst road rage she'd ever seen.

The police paid this guy a visit, and when they spoke to me on the phone they described him as 'an arsehole'.  It seems he was pretty aggressive with him, there was evidence of drug taking at his house, etc... The outcome was that, although they couldn't prosecute him for his actions that day due to a lack of video evidence/police witness, they COULD serve him with an anti social driving order, meaning his car will get flagged up on the numberplate recognition systems in police cars every time he passes one.  They've ordered that he is subjected to both drink and drug tests EVERY time this happens, and they're hoping to catch him doing something.

As I said, it's possible that I made a mistake and perhaps misjudged the gap on the roundabout.  But even if I did - his behaviour was completely unacceptable.  And because of my report, and the way he acted towards the officers who visited him, the police fully believe they'll catch him driving dangerously in the next couple of weeks.  They seemed pretty certain of it.  And if they do, then good - that's one less dangerous driver on the road.  He could have caused an accident with his deliberate actions, and who knows what he would have done to me if I'd got out of my car.

So screw people who get arsey about ""grassing up"".  Perhaps they'll be the victim of something next time - whether it's threatening behaviour, or being hit by an idiot using his phone while driving.  They might think twice then.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"The real problem with playing three at the back is that in the modern game, most teams only play with one true striker.  The rule of thumb for most managers is that you want one CB to mark the striker + a spare man when you're defending.  Three at the back against a single striker means that you have one CB + two spare men, which then means you're gonna get outnumbered somewhere else on the pitch (usually in the middle of the park).

A traditional four man back line is a bit more adaptable, because if you're up against one striker, you're covered in the middle and so your fullbacks can press higher up the pitch.  If you encounter a two man strike force, then you rope one of your CDMs or fullbacks in to help be the spare man.

It also leaves you awfully exposed down the flanks and susceptible to counter attacks unless the back line is very well drilled.  Every time an opposition winger gets it, all they have to do is beat your winger, then they've got a free run up the pitch.  A CB has to move across to cover, and the other two CBs have to move with him in unison, otherwise huge gaps open up for clever midfielders to run through.

So even though there are lots of things I like about a three man defence (and thought for a while last year that we should do it), I don't think the team has the defensive discipline or shape to do it, plus I'm wary that we'd be even more exposed to counter attacks than we already are, not to mention being outnumbered higher up the pitch.",null,0,null,1422227374,null,0,false,0,co0o1jm,null,t3_2tndyh,null,t1_co0o1jm,null,t3_2tndyh,null,null,null,1424393715,null,22,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,22,null

Detection is straightforward. We have IR satellites to detect launches and Over-The-Horizon RADAR systems to track the missiles in flight. 

Defense systems are Much Harder. There is [the Russian system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-35_anti-ballistic_missile_system) which surrounds Moscow whereby they launch nukes at the incoming nukes and rely on neutron flux (and damn those below) and the USA's [GBMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense) which is still in trials for destroying devices still in space. But no-one has a ballistic missile shield that works or anything close to it. 

In the orthodox view of nuclear strategy this is a good thing, perhaps surprisingly. The reasoning is that anyone who invents an ABM shield is safe from the [Second Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_strike) effect allowing them to threaten others with nuclear weapons with impunity as they are now safe from any retaliatory strike.

I've been holding onto this ""Chelsea XI of mostly youth products"" pipe dream for too long.

As Jose once said himself, spending absorbent amounts of money on running a youth academy, but failing to ever really bring through players to the first team is counter productive. As a team with the aim of winning as my titles as possible, quickly, I think we'd be best served getting rid of the academy and just spending on the first team.

This means that I just vote for what I feel is most important. Last time it was making sure we didn't come off as reckless and continuing to spend willy-nilly – hence the Tories. This time I think that, having secured our position and primarily our ability to attract lenders, we should be spending – hence Labour.

There are several areas which I agree with the Tories more than with Labour (defence, crime - although not Theresa May, the environment) but there are also many areas which I agree with Labour and the Lib Dems more. However, I don't tactically vote. An advantage of being a student is that I can either vote at home or at Uni – one is a Labour marginal, the other is a Tory safe, so I can always vote where I think it will have the most impact.

I disagree that if no-one voted tactically there would be no problem. You would have the very real possibility that a minority party would get in on the basis of a split vote elsewhere. In fact, tactical voting is the ultimate expression of a key underlying tenet of any function democracy – the ability to compromise. If you can't compromise, you end up like some countries, burning down cities because you can't accept that your view is a minority one. Obviously, tactically voting in a FPTP system is not the *best* way to do this; implement a mixed-member proportional representation system would be much better. However, MMPR (or any kind of proportional representation) has its own drawbacks. FPTP Governments tend to be much more decisive, and some historians reckon it is one of the key features of Westminster-style democracy that allowed the Anglosphere to expand so much.

&gt;

&gt;Mignolet was born in [Sint-Truiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Truiden), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium). He first joined his local football team, [Belgian Second Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Second_Division) side [Sint-Truiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Sint-Truidense_V.V.), in 2004, eventually rising through their youth system to become their first-choice goalkeeper in 2006 at the age of just 18. In 2009 he made 29 appearances and scored a penalty in the league, as he helped Sint-Truiden to win the [Belgian Second Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Second_Division), and was named [Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_professional_football_awards) the following year after he helped Sint-Truiden to avoid relegation.

If you're wanting to get the three 'must dos' completed, you're probably going to have to spend a couple of days in and around the area, as you won't be able to get them all done in one day. Ben Macdui and Cairngorm should be doable in the same walk, check out this route [here](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/cairngorms/macdui-cairngorm.shtml).

If you're feeling energetic, you could do that walk (which would get both Macdui and Cairngorm) and then from the top of Cairngorm, head back down the path, but there's a path heading directly south down to the banks of Loch Avon. You'll descend about 500m and then follow Loch Avon for another 2.5 miles until you get to the Fords of Avon refuge, which is a good point to camp.

The main issue is that Ben Avon isn't as accessible as the other two. [Here's](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=14172) a route which starts at the same place as you would, but they don't go up Macdui and Cairngorm. However you can pick up the route from the Fords of Avon refuge and follow it towards Ben Avon (lots of scrambling, since there's not much in the way of paths).

From there, you could head south towards Braemar, before heading west. Glen Feshie is a bit of a walk from Braemar, unless you wanted to then leave from Aveimore, then you could manage it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend heading west until you get to Whitebridge, before heading south and following the path down to Glen Tilt, which is an absolutely beautiful location. All very easy to walk on, and you'll end up at Blairatholl at the end of it.

Basically all of the above is a vague amalgamation of your two routes, trying to get as much as possible. As others have said, www.walkhighlands.co.uk has a lot of useful routes.

&gt; Parliament retained under its own control the greater part of the temporary revenues, and relieved the sovereign of the cost of the naval and military services and the burden of the national debt. During the reigns of William III, Anne, George I and George II the sovereign remained responsible for the maintenance of the civil government and for the support of the royal household and dignity, being allowed for these purposes the hereditary revenues and certain taxes.[11]

&gt; As the state machinery expanded, the cost of the civil government exceeded the income from the Crown lands and feudal rights; this created a personal debt for the monarch.

&gt; On George III's accession he surrendered the income from the Crown lands to parliament, together with abrogating responsibility for the cost of the civil government and the clearance of associated debts. **As a result, and in order to avoid pecuniary embarrassment, he was granted a fixed civil list payment and the income retained from the Duchy of Lancaster.** The King surrendered to parliamentary control the hereditary excise duties, post office revenues, and ""the small branches"" of hereditary revenue including rents of the Crown lands in England (which amounted to about £11,000, or £1,451,144 today), and was granted a civil list annuity of £800,000 (equal to £105,537,736 today) for the support of his household, subject to the payment of certain annuities to members of the royal family.

Um.... really? That all sounds so lovely it is however nonsense. The Orange Order was formed explicitly to smash the United Irishmen and the unity between Catholics and Presbyterians 

&gt; In July 1795 a Reverend Devine had preached a sermon at Drumcree Church to commemorate the ""Battle of the Boyne"".[21] In his History of Ireland Vol I (published in 1809), the historian Francis Plowden described the events that followed this sermon:

&gt;""Reverend Devine so worked up the minds of his audience, that upon retiring from service, on the different roads leading to their respective homes, they gave full scope to the anti-papistical zeal, with which he had inspired them... falling upon every Catholic they met, beating and bruising them without provocation or distinction, breaking the doors and windows of their houses, and actually murdering two unoffending Catholics in a bog. This unprovoked atrocity of the Protestants revived and redoubled religious rancour. The flame spread and threatened a contest of extermination...""

The ""Battle of the Diamond was an engineered Battle"", hyped up on lies, misinformation and propaganda. Sectarian Tension had actually dissipated due to the actions of the United Irishmen. Only to be stoked up again.

&gt; Under the influence of the United Irishmen according to T. A. Jackson, political unity was replacing sectarian divisions in Ulster. This he says inspired ""public-spirited zeal"" in Catholic areas with areas like Armagh where the population had been evenly divided and the scene of sporadic violence between the Peep O'Day Boys and Catholic Defenders for years dying down to nothing under the influence of the United Irish. However with the arrival of the new pro-Catholic Viceroy, Earl Fitzwilliam the Peep of Day boys resumed their activity after nearly a two-year absence. Jackson suggests that it is impossible to miss the connection between this fact, and the lie propagated by the Clare-Beresford faction that Fitzwilliam was there to replace the Protestant ascendancy with a Catholic one. With Defenders, again in action, he says, every successful defence against Peep of Day attack being then portrayed as a ""Catholic outrage."" This ""artificially worked-up pogrom"" would culminate in what came to be known as the Battle of the Diamond.[9] In the aftermath of the ""battle"" which occurred on 21 September 1795 the Orange Society was founded, with the first Orange lodge established in Dyan, County Tyrone. Its first grand master was James Sloan of Loughgall, in who's inn the victory by the Peep O'Day Boys was celebrated.[10][Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Orange_Institution)

Within two months of the formation of the Orange Order 7,000 Catholics had been driven from there homes in Armagh.

&gt; He says that a determination was expressed to ""driving from this quarter of the county the entire of its Roman Catholic population"", with notices posted warning them ""to Hell or Connaught"".[18] Other people were warned by notices not to inform on local Orangemen or ""I will blow your soul to the low hills of Hell and burn the house you are in"".[18] Within two months, 7000 Catholics had been driven out of County Armagh.[18] According to Lord Gosford, the governor of Armagh:
&gt; 
&gt; It is no secret that a persecution is now raging in this country… the only crime is… profession of the Roman Catholic faith. Lawless banditti have constituted themselves judges... and the sentence they have denounced... is nothing less than a confiscation of all property, and an immediate banishment.[18]

The Formation of the Order was willfully spurred on by powerful elites who feared the unity of Catholics and Protestants.
&gt; 
&gt; The “Castle clique” of the Protestant Ascendancy retorted *""by rousing up the more ignorant, debased, corrupt, and reactionary stratum,""* according to T. A. Jackson. The objective was to create disunity and disorder under pretence of ""passion for the Protestant religion"". This view was shared by John Mitchel, who wrote *“The chief object of the Government was now to invent and disseminate fearful rumours of intended massacres of all the Protestant people by the Catholics.""* As a result of the efforts and influence of the United Irishmen, sectarian divisions were being replaced by political unity. Religion therefore was the last option left to the reactionaries, and to stock the traditional fear of the Papacy and hostility to the Catholic religion. Dr. Daniel Owen Madden says of this period:
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Efforts were made to infuse into the mind of the Protestant feelings of distrust to his Catholic fellow-countrymen. Popish plots and conspiracies were fabricated with a practical facility, which some influential authorities conceived it no degradation to stoop to; and alarming reports of these dark confederations were circulated with a restless assiduity""

She had answers, he didn't like them and did the Paxman trick of making small taunts etc to unsettle her - taunting someone that they don't have a detailed tax breakdown and won't until their manifesto is just riling them up on purpose.

To people already swinging towards the Greens he will come across as ignoring perfectly reasonable answers (details will be in the Manifesto) to try and nail her on detail she couldn't be expected to have. To people already swinging away from the Greens, she looked an unprepared wannabe who shouldn't be anywhere near power. It's not really going to change anyones mind.

I think truth lies somewhere in-between. Harsh interview that was belligerent just to be belligerent, but also a relatively ill-prepared leader.

Basic income is a hard concept to sell without a detailed example to explain how it works, not  a nice one to do in an interview situation. The wealth tax one was his best one, really had her there - she needed a better answer on that one. Immigration, seemed a really crappy line from him... he was basing it on fuzzy language, not a concrete promise. Also the arms industry thing, he based it on a premise he had no quote for (abolishing the arms industry entirely).

But she has to handle that better. He was setting himself up for a few put downs and mocking, she didn't go for them.

That would certainly explain how Plaid's leader can only speak some Welsh wouldn't it?

If you'd actually searched for a real quote instead of just making something up by making a value judgement based upon your own beliefs(where have I heard that line before?) you would have realised that they certainly don't believe that. Yes they believe in bilingualism in Wales but so do the Welsh Conservatives so that's hardly noteworthy. 

&gt; Ghandi being a nationalist says nothing for or against nationalism - come on, you know better than that.

Actually yes it does as it shows nationalism ins't uniformly bad. It most certainly can be as nationalism has been responsible for some of the greatest atrocities, but it has also been used for good as with Gandhi or Mandela. You can't paint it all with the same brush.

&gt; I'm singling out Plaid because I've had a lot of terrible personal experiences of meeting and dealing with them. I could go into anecdotes of them walking around welsh towns with banners and stickers calling ""ALLAN SAIS! FUCK OFF!"", but that's still not my argument

If you've had bad experiences in Wales then I can only apologise but are you certain it was the party itself or if it was just ""fringe candidates on all ends of the spectrum?"" Some UKIP supporters say similar things about immigrants yet that doesn't mean the party condones it, and as such I do not consider UKIP ""morally equal"" with the BNP.

&gt; I think that you're making a value judgement based upon your own beliefs.

What makes you think I support them? I just find it ridiculous that views such as the one you have still exist when it's quite clearly untrue for anyone who's actually looked at the subject without going in with any preconceptions.

Just like Van Gaal, he doesn't seem to take crap and stands by his choices. He just has balls. We needed someone to change the mentality and he seems like the right man to do it, plus he's so young hopefully he is here for a long time to come. Some of his decisions have been a bit strange but those have been decreasing each week.

Just remember, he doesn't have the squad he wants - there is a lot of deadwood. Either players who just aren't good enough, don't have the right attitude or both.

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

And

&gt;PD312 The Green Party is committed to the early conversion of economic, scientific and technological resources presently used to support the arms race, to socially useful and productive ends. Some military training areas should be decommissioned and used as nature reserves, with suitable provision for access by the public.

So they're basically expecting us to rebuild our military in the event of shit hitting the fan, but with a defence industry that's been dismantled. The policies are completely at odds. 

When it comes to the arms industry, it moves fast. What is cutting edge tech on year, isn't the next. It's very much a use it or lose it sector. Not something you can build back up at short notice.

Are you serious? She got absolutely torn apart! I want to like the Greens, and I would consider voting for them, but this was a disaster. You can't criticise Andrew Neil for tearing apart their policies when they're clearly flawed. And if they aren't flawed, then she ought to be able to defend them, and she couldn't. 

She also seemed on edge and on the defensive throughout the whole interview. To some extent, I can sympathise, because it sounds to me like their 'democratic' system of policy formulation is actually an opportunity for radical greens to unduly influence the manifesto. I mean, take the point about defence. I think a majority of people in the country would be supportive of a reduced army and no trident, but no sane thinking person is going to think that you could convert the military industrial complex in to a green energy one. It's ridiculous and, more to the point, totally unnessecary to state as a policy. 

Also, on the Citizens Income front, if you're going to start throwing figures around, you better to be damn sure you know how you're going to pay for it. Saying 'ask us later' is suicide.

Finally, there's obviously a bit of division between her and Lucas as to who is going to head operations up when it comes to the two debates, but allowing that to show in the interview was totally stupid, and could have been easily avoided. 

I'm sorry, but it was just amateur hour, really. The thing that worries me most though are some of the actual policies listed. Forget pie in the sky, some of them are more like pie in space.

Hope this is enough evidence for you. Oxford features much lower in any list than Cambridge, even so, Cambridge is not the best, in fact, these would show Imperial or LSE to be the best for grad prospects. This fact is pretty much accepted at other UK universities.

I spend roughly £30 a week on food however it can be less depending on what I buy. Sometimes I'll do batches of stuff and then freeze it.

There are a couple of shops on campus. Which one is the nearest depends on which college you are in. Spar and Central are the main ones.

The shop closest to me is Central. I try to buy as little stuff as possible in there because it is basically products from the supermarket with a 20% price increase. I sometimes go there to pick up the essentials during the weekend if I can't be bothered to walk to Spar.

Spar is a mini-supermarket thing.

By the way I would count the Kumars as 100% mainstream. 

Idris Elba probably did have a better shot in the US because US society has more black people and thus TV reflects that by offering more roles. It's not bad that there are fewer roles in the UK for black people in the UK than the US - that's just the nature of each society. London is not racist because of that. 

Nor is it racist rejecting black actors regardless of talent - there's more to it than that. As a casting director you should be able to do that if you feel a white person would suit the role better. As I said before the answer is no jamming someone non-white into a cast where they look out of place. If Midsomer is rejecting non-white actors  then that's probably because they don't feel a black woman with a south London Jamaican accent doesn't quite fit the tone of the show even if she was the most talented there. And that's fine - it's more insulting in my eyes to assume black people can't get jobs that fit them and instead have to be crowbarred in as the token non-white person. 

I think Lenny Henry has a point if black people are being under-represented as a proportion of their presence in the population but I don't see that to be honest. I think all you can do is prevent open racism encourage cultural output from minority groups and allow it to grow.

He also may have signed massively with united by that is not normally his style looking at his clubs he massively encourages youth development.

He always is definitely an unbelievable manager and I don't think his record of always winning things at every club he's been at would have ended when he joined us.


Poch is a nice fit for us, ATM but it is so short in his tenure. He needs time because you can't judge someone over a short spell and that includes saying he looks good, it's too early to say how good a fit he is. Could come summer, he signs absolute shit and we do badly.

Nah, this is nonsense. This is the Republicans in America saying Romney was going to win up until then night he didn't, and then refusing to believe it when it happened... despite Nate Silver reliably informing us all that it would not happen.

The reality of the polls all show that Miliband is likely to either head a minority or coalition government. The chances of the Tories getting back in are slim to none - a government has not increased its share of seats in history, and the Tories need at least as many as they have now, lose none to UKIP and gain some Lib Dem ones as they will not enter coalition again. UKIP will not gain enough seats to cast the Tories in to power over the other parties.

However that's not to say it has no effect on graduates.

I have mixed feelings about that place. On the one hand it's enabling people to use wood that might otherwise go into the ground or be burnt and I think it employs people who are transitioning back into work.

 On the otherhand, considering it's free wood, they sometimes charge more than a lumber yard would charge you when you take into account delivery, wastage (due to random damage, nails, chunks missing) and possible need to weatherproof or treat the wood. Also, they sell furniture that to me seems overpriced. 

I think it's going to be shut down for a big development of housing. Sucks that it'l have to close.

Take this figure with a pinch of salt. I would imagine this figure includes rebates for senior bus passes and student cards but also, these figures include all the subsidies for school buses and apparently un profitable routes (which they've gutted now). This figure is high and I suspect part of the reason to put the ticket price up, aside from fuel costs, is a guaranteed high income from all regular customers (who can get the bus way more often because it's cheaper).

&gt;If you dispose of:
&gt;
&gt;* a dwelling house (which can include a house, flat, houseboat or fixed caravan) which is your home, or
&gt;
&gt;* part of a dwelling house which is your home, or
&gt;
&gt;* part of the garden attached to your home
&gt;
&gt;you would normally have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on any gain
&gt;you make.
&gt;
&gt;However, you will be entitled to full relief where all the following conditions are met:
&gt;
&gt;* the dwelling house has been your only or main residence throughout your period of ownership, and
&gt;
&gt;* you have not been absent, other than for an allowed period of absence or because you have been living in job-related accommodation, during your period of ownership
&gt;
&gt;* the garden or grounds including the buildings on them are not greater than the permitted area, and
&gt;
&gt;* no part of your home has been used exclusively for business purposes during your period of ownership.
&gt;
&gt;The terms in italics are explained from page 2 onwards. If you meet all of these conditions, you will not have to pay CGT on the disposal 1
&gt;
&gt;You will not need to complete the Capital gains summary pages of your tax return if you have made no other disposals or chargeable gains and do not wish to make any capital gains claims or elections. 


It has to be classed as your main residence for the whole period of ownership in order to qualify for CGT relief

EDIT - Formatting

EDIT 2 - If you live in a property for only part of the time you own it you can claim some relief for that period (ie. reduced CGT) but you cant simply switch around your designed main residence to completely eliminate your CGT bill.

The CPS legal guidance states that driving through a puddle causing pedestrians to be splashed is likely to be considered to be inconsiderate driving.

The penalty is usually a fine and 3-9 penalty points. The court also has the power to disqualify the driver.

Another option would be for an offence against the person, such as a battery, to be charged.

It is a summary only offence which means there is a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment. This is not to be confused with common assault, which has the same maximum penalty but different requirements. The difference between the two is often misunderstood or not appreciated:

An assault is committed when a person intentionally or recklessly causes another to apprehend the immediate infliction of unlawful force.

A battery is committed when a person intentionally and recklessly applies unlawful force to another.

The offence can be committed intentionally or recklessly – that is to say, a person does an act causing unlawful force to be applied to another without the specific intent of doing so, but appreciating that his or her actions are likely to so cause unlawful force to be applied.

**So, where a driver has seen the puddle and has continued to drive through it, he or she may be guilty of a battery on the basis that they were reckless as to the unlawful force that would be applied to the pedestrians on the footpath.**

&gt;Pressing is a lot more tactical and complicated than people in here seem to realise. Lambert knows how to do it because he played under Pochettino. He might not actually get the tackle in himself but if his position is correct it allows the team to push up and pressure the player who is going to receive the ball, or force the player in possession to make a mistake.

I thought this comment was worth repeating.

I don't know if Balotelli has ever played in a system as tactically demanding as the one Rodgers employs. And Rodgers is the sort of boss who demands and rewards hard work on the training ground. If the player doesn't do that, the player does not get the time on matchday. Simple as that.

Borini works hard? He gets a start. Jon Flanagan works hard? Look at him starting against Arsenal last season. Sterling works hard? He gets regular playing time. Etc. etc.

If you don't work hard - no matter your level of raw talent - then maybe you are shipped off like Suso and out of favor like Balotelli.

All that being said, I do sympathise with Balotelli because I think there is too much at stake for LFC for Rodgers to have the time to take Balotelli under his wing, stick with him, support him, encourage him and help Balotelli grow and evolve into an effective player.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of pressure for Rodgers and the club to succeed and there is little room for error, little time available to focus solely on Balotelli's development and many other options available over Balotelli.

I can only imagine the pressure for Balotelli to succeed as well in a very limited amounts of time. I can only imagine the 24-year-old Balotelli getting more and more frustrated not only with himself but with the lack of opportunities and maybe reaching a point where he thinks, 'Why work this hard and risk injury and learn all these new tactics when I will be transferred in the summer anyway?'

Not a great situation for Balotelli and I'm sure a lot of it is brought upon himself as well. But Balotelli needs to meet everyone in the middle. If he expects the supporters, coaches and the club to give him a fair chance, then he has to do his part as well.",null,0,null,1422247265,null,0,false,0,co0z51j,null,t3_2tlx5o,null,t1_co0z51j,null,t3_2tlx5o,null,null,null,1424388385,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

If both happened to play for Chelsea, Mourinho would likely choose one based on form. 

Both players seem to embody the ""philosophy"" Jose is attempting to instill. I'm definite Isco's link up play with Fabregas and Hazard would be phenomenal, but I'm not sure if his tactically flexibility surpasses that of Oscar's which allows for such fluidity in our front three as well as our midfield. I'm sure Isco wouldn't struggle long to adapt to our system and he's relatively the same age as Oscar (22 and 23 respectively) so the room for growth is massive, but for now Oscar hedges Isco in my opinion because he has already established himself as an integral component to our philosophy and starting XI. 

That being said, while the potential for Oscar is amazing, he is not devoid of any criticism; His passing is sometimes sloppy and could be better and he doesn't necessarily have the ""vision"" to thread through balls consistently.

Of course, the big question is: How credible is this rumour?

That gets me thinking about where rumours come from. Because they can be:

* Outright lies. Which is hard for me to believe no matter how lazy or awful a journalist/media outlet is.
* A whisper. Which means *someone* is thinking about it, talking about it openly to a journalist, etc. Of course, it could simply be misdirection or misinterpretation or just wrong.
* A lazy connecting of dots (i.e. Raheem Sterling is young and a future star, LFC doesn't have Champions League, Sterling hasn't signed a contract, Real Madrid has money that Liverpool may want, Real Madrid could want Sterling to lead a core of young players for the future. Sterling to Real Madrid confirmed!!!)
* The truth.

Now, I am not familiar with Benzema's situation at Real Madrid. Is he unhappy with the club? Is the club unhappy with him? If so, then perhaps Benzema can leave for the right price.

But then why did Benzema and Real Madrid agree to an extension that would keep Benzema until 2019? If Real Madrid really wanted to move Benzema, then wouldn't a new contract with, I imagine, increased wages be prohibitive for some clubs or devalue Benzema's transfer value for RM? Or perhaps RM are being nice and hoping that increased wages will set him for better personal terms at a future club?

Liverpool may want Benzema but it doesn't really seem like Real Madrid are really willing to sell him. So then you wonder if Liverpool is willing to *overpay* for Benzema and if it's worth it to overpay for Benzema. Not to mention whether or not Benzema actually wants to go to England and play for an exciting but young Liverpool club who still seem to be a season or two away from regular Champions League play.

I, for one, love the business side of these things and the negotiations must be incredibly interesting for both the player/agent and the club.

- Raheem Sterling and his camp know that Liverpool couldn't possibly let Sterling go. Not only would it be a PR disaster for LFC, the club would also lose an extremely talented player who still has years and years to go. Therefore, Sterling and his agent can play hardball and battle for better personal terms.
- However, the club knows that how they pay an 18-year-old player (brilliant but still inexperienced) like Sterling can set a precedent for the future. If they are not careful, then they may set themselves up for an unfavorable situation when negotiating with, say, Jerome Sinclair (18), Jordan Rossiter (17), Jordon Ibe (18), Sheyi Ojo (17), etc. etc.
- I think the club also know that Sterling is likely not very interested in playing for another team for a variety of reasons. LFC would never sell within the league (at least not to a potential Champions League rival), Sterling wouldn't hear the end of it from LFC supporters and face the pressure from the team that overpays for an English future-star. Would Sterling go abroad? Again, who can afford him? And would Sterling even be assured the same playing time he gets with Liverpool? Does Sterling even want to be in Spain? France? Italy? To be a teenager far away from home, in a new culture, learning a new language?

LFC knows Sterling won't actually go anywhere other than Liverpool. Sterling knows that too. But then again, Sterling also knows that there is no way LFC would risk calling Sterling's bluff and having him leave the club.

So, it's quite an interesting situation and it will be fascinating to see how it all shakes out.

Ultimately, they'll get the deal done.

I think Sterling and LFC will agree to a shorter term deal (3 years) at somewhat higher wages. Sterling gets what he wants and will be able to renegotiate when he is 21.

Between the sightings list on [Clive's Website](http://www.whoisdoctorwho.co.uk/visualdata.shtml), and the statements that Clara made to the cybers in *Death in Heaven* whilst she was convincing them that she was the Doctor, it sounds like Nine went looking for her again and couldn't find her.  

It is also rather problematic in terms of timelines. Susan was on Earth at the end of a Dalek invasion (and during another one), and yet between the end of the Time War and, probably, *Victory of the Daleks*, it seems that there were no Daleks who would have been around to carry out that invasion. Certainly at the time that Nine went looking, there were none. In *Dalek* he was quite positive about that.  

As a result, it's really not clear that Susan's timeline would have been accessible to him then. Would it be now?

Further history to the case [here](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2014/B18.html), [here](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2014/B21.html), [here](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2014/B22.html), and [here](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2014/B26.html). The first source makes reference to Judge Orrell finalising the original order for 'B' (the child in question) in 2012 (paragraph 6). I haven't been able to find records for this judgement and this might be what the Mail is hinting at when it says the reasons for the judgement haven't been made public. However, as a quick read of the first five paragraphs of the 2nd source will reveal, the reasons are quite clear, viz: The Court has previously accepted that the father has assaulted the child requiring her to be taken into care.
  
Unfortunately both the father and his mother (i.e. the paternal grandmother) appear to have regularly breached the original order which has led, by degrees, to the imposition of a Hadkinson Order on them. A [Hadkinson Order](http://raydensolicitors.co.uk/blog/legal-news/contempt-of-court-and-family-law/) limits the wrongdoer's access to the Court until they rectify the breach. As the source indicates this kind of order is usually done as a last resort so it looks like they've pretty-much ignored every order set against them and instead of arguing their case using law and reason they have instead taken an adversarial approach throughout, and attempted to use insinuation and accusations of wrongdoing against the lead social worker in the case. This has persuaded no-one (except the press, apparently) that they have the child's best interests at heart.

I was a Yes voter but with a No vote have become more determined that the UK needs political change and, given we voted to stay, we should try to be a part of that. The worry I have is the Tories and UKIP, they have nothing to lose in Scotland (realistically one rubbish Tory MP and a foul UKIP MEP). Why should I have any faith in parties who I believe will end up in Government again and who have nothing to lose by screwing over Scotland? 

The SNP are a smart party, they don't really do principles they just do opportunism but they're good enough at it that they are becoming more and more popular as Labour tie themselves in knots trying to deal with UKIP rather than going back to their founding principles.  For all foreseeable elections (the next UKGov and ScotParl ones) we have no real opposition in Scotland and that is dangerous.

The problem comes that as our society changes, people who have jobs that have replication, or rather large influence of their actions, will be paid a lot more.

Have massively mixed feelings about this: On the one hand, it feels wrong crowing that schools aren't doing any better. On the other, as a teacher who quit because the whole culture of schooling became unbearable under the Coalition, this is something of a vindication.

EDIT: I've got to break this down a little bit because I know what was going on:

&gt;A DfE source said Hunt did not appear to understand that sponsored academies would improve faster because they had further to go

... Which made converting them into academies a waste of money

&gt;a 60% increase in the proportion of children studying core academic subjects at GCSE

This is my favourite shitty statistic from the DfE: They introduced a measure that had never been used before, then patted themselves on the back when the measurement 'improved'. Of course it changed! If you've never asked people to do something before, very few of them do it. Once they started asking schools to get more pupils into 'core subjects', funnily enough, schools started doing it.

&gt;Britain was stagnating in international league tables while the rest of the world moved on.

This is the other big lie. One league table showed not only Britain but numerous other wealthy countries surprisingly low in the world rankings. Note that not only Britain was 'stagnating'. Other league tables showed a much more nuanced picture, though all agreed that Finland was very high or near the top. Finland has highly-qualified, university-trained teachers, a relaxed school culture (no uniforms, even teachers dress informally), little focus on exams, no selection based on ability, and no academy, private, or grammar schools. Similar things can be said of other consitently high-performing school systems in nations similar to the UK.

&gt;Education secretary Nicky Morgan also faces further embarrassment after her high-profile consultation exercise on teacher workload [...] found that teachers named “government policy” as a main cause of extra work in state schools.

Chances are that you will receive whatever amounts to a state pension at an age of 68-70. On current reckoning this would be worth in the region of £150 per week (£7,500 PA) and should continue being worth this in ""real terms"", but there are a lot of potential changes of government until then, so who knows what it will look like.

Given that you own your house with no mortgage at 31 you are in an *incredibly* favourable position - most people at that stage still have a large amount of debt to pay down, eating into their monthly costs significantly.

/u/donaldtrumptwat talks about his works pension paying £450 (per week?). If it is weekly, it amounts to a notional pension pot of about £0.5 M. This is most likely a final salary pension, which are few and far between.

You will instead be looking at a ""defined contribution"" pension when you start working again. In this, your employer will pay a certain percentage of your salary (typically 3-10%) and you will pay some into it as well.

The main point is to start saving a reasonable amount monthly for a long period. Using a pension or ISA wrapper will improve the tax-efficiency and saving in ""real assets"" (stocks &amp; shares primarily) will generally protect you against inflation.

Assuming you could save £400 per month, earning 3% ""real return"" (that is, over and above inflation), over 38 years you would have a pot of money worth around £340,000. At a withdrawal rate of 4% this would produce an income of £13,600 PA, in addition to any state pension.

Make it £500 per month and the end amount would be £420,000, with an income of £16,800 at 4% withdrawals.

Bearing in mind that most people in your shoes would be spending £500 on monthly mortgage payments this shouldn't be too much of a stretch!

Hypothetically, though it's a vicious cycle in his case because when he does get game time, he's in bad form, and just gets benched for Willian.

Though I think the problems with him extend beyond that, he's never been really consistent at his time at Chelsea, and I - incorrectly - assumed that the World Cup might've been his nadir. I suppose it's up to Mourinho to see if his potential can be salvaged, or if he's simply on his way to Wolfsburg.

In such a scenario, could Luis and Azpi start as LB and RB respectively instead given that our flanks will be more attacking?

I'm not actually sure Azpi is a better attacking full back than Ivanovic at this point, honestly.

&gt; You can't when you're a Uni student.

Speaking of signing on, I ended up in a spectacular catch-22 when I had to re-sit some 2nd year exams, but could only sit them in January, so I had to basically take a year out.

During that year, I wasn't paid any maintenance loan (because I'd already got the loan for 2nd year, and hadn't started 3rd year, which makes perfect sense), couldn't get a job - because this was 2009 in Newcastle, which nearly 6 years later still has horrific levels of unemployment, especially youth - and couldn't sign on because I was technically still a student.

I ended up having to spend the couple of thousand pounds I was luckily left by my Nan when she died to cover rent/bills and not land my housemates in the shit with me, and after 6 months of this then had to move back in with my parents some 300 miles south just to get a job.

If either of those things didn't happen - my Nan dying, or my parents being able to take me back in for a few months - I don't know what would have happened.

&gt; The radical Islamist movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the Islamic revival and Islamist movement of the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.

&gt; Some have argued that ""without the writings"" of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb, ""al-Qaeda would not have existed.""[100] Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah.

&gt; To restore Islam, he said a vanguard movement of righteous Muslims was needed to establish ""true Islamic states"", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like socialism and nationalism. Enemies of Islam in Qutb's view included ""treacherous Orientalists""[101] and ""world Jewry,"" who plotted ""conspiracies"" and ""wicked[ly]"" opposed Islam.

&gt; In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden:

&gt; Islam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.[102]

&gt; Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden's mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda,[103] Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. ""Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison.""[104] Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.[105]

&gt; One of the most powerful of Qutb's ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not. Rather, they were apostates. That not only gave jihadists ""a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim,"" but made ""it a religious obligation to execute"" these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law

Its not like they don't have a ideology. However since the West and many others reject it they find themselves fighting for it. E.G: Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq/Syria today.  
The Green's are right to state it shouldn't be a crime to merely support the philosophy of the movement, however the media influence since 9/11 is so strong that people reject the idea outright considering these movements as enemies of the state.",null,0,null,1422269762,null,0,false,0,co15ppu,null,t3_2tpfb0,null,t1_co15ppu,null,t1_co14xb3,null,null,null,1424385284,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

There are no id cards and there is no subscription fee, there is no state and the people that claim to be leaders do not have absolute power.

ISIS, however is a common singular group so we can look at in one sense. ISIS contains disgusting and bloodthirsty members, yes, but it also contains bureaucrats and academics.
Personally, I think we should focus on how they came to be and how they are funded rather than focusing on individual members - as if we could stop an entire gang by arresting street level dealers.   They are well funded by saudis and they came to be because, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US made it *illegal to be a member* of the Ba'ath Party and sacked practically the entire military command structure. This has led to the existence of IS a group that - if they had the capability - they would absolutely destroy millions of people and justify it with some deliberately misinterpreted ancient scripture.

I don't know whether or not being *a member* of ISIS should be illegal. I just think we should ask if we think the same leadership that his pitted us against the middle east. That created the mess that is modern Iraq, should be allowed to do their tactics of more of the same.

The only thing that you incorrect on is the impact of immigration to low-income earners... it is in negligible as I said (and actually helps middle/high earners).  Here a story/sources with links to studies at bottom.   

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/29/migrants-wages-uk-immigration_n_5409319.html

It's counterintuitive I grant you, but there is no relevant impact on pay and with our unemployment so low there is no good fiscal argument against EU immigration.  EU immigrants are also less likely to claim unemployment benefits than UK citizens, so that is a false argument as well.   The cost of just letting good 'apples' would be very high, and difficult.  While you may get some support for this in principle (indeed a key reason for people voting UKIP) there would need to very clear proposal on how this would work and the real costs.  There is really not an issue that needs fixing when you look at the figures/studies.  

My last point is that given that EU immigrants are proven to help our economy, it is a political decision on where the contributions are going.

We know how many UKIP voters claim to have little understanding of UKIPs policies because their is a break for UKIP. ",null,0,null,1422271567,null,0,false,0,co162po,null,t3_2tmhpx,null,t1_co162po,null,t3_2tmhpx,null,null,null,1424385116,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

What you claim the club is responsible for is a commercial reality I'm afraid. People in some sections of the ground are discouraged from standing because the club _have_ to be seen to do that. It's the same for every other club. 

As for the lower tickets prices for younger fans: I've seen this touted a thousand times. Indeed, it's something the CST (and others) have advocated, discussed and lobbied for, but why do you think the club is yet to do something about it? Because there's no evidence it will make a difference. Take domestic cups, for example. They're the perfect opportunity for people who can't afford league games to go, but is the atmosphere noticeably better? No, it's not, and I'm speaking from experience. Was the game against Bradford a cauldron of noise when the team most needed it when tickets were £25? No, it wasn't. 

Further, it's not just about lowering prices, it's about whether those people are prepared to give up a significant part of their disposable income to go on a _regular_ basis. When I first started going on my own, I was an apprentice on truly shit wages, but I went because I loved football. The proclaimed love for football is a very different beast today and is often touted by people who've never been near a game on their local pitches, much less to a stadium to watch a match.

So, if we knock off, say, a fiver of the cost of a match day ticket - depending on your definition of a younger fan - how much difference do you think that will make? Hardly any, that's what.

Agreed on vanity and fertility treatment, but there are a couple of points I'd make:

1) Not all cosmetic procedures are for vanity. Keeping with your theme of boobs, someone who's got abnormal breasts (eg. one significantly larger than the other, or someone who's had a mastectomy) can have genuine emotional distress about their body image

2) Accident and emergency is down the dumps right now, but a large portion of the problem is the ridiculous waiting time to get a GP appointment and the difficulty getting an emergency appointment. I remember as a teenager in the early to mid 2000s it was unusual to wait more than 48 hours or so for your GP appointment. Now I have to wait a week if I'm lucky.

null,false,DRBB22,null,null,null,"&gt; This is the thinnest squad I've seen since the turn of the century in terms of numbers and quality.

In terms of quality? I'm sorry, that's completely ludicrous statement.

- Cech is now our #2 keeper, you only have to look back to the turn of the decade, let alone the turn of the century to find that Turnbull was our #2.

- Mikel and Ramires used to be **start** games for us just two years ago, what we've deemed to be starting quality then has now been relegated to our bench; that's an obvious improvement, quality wise. I expected Ramires to be better this season, obviously he's been struggling for form and fitness.

- Do you remember when we were utterly devoid of any attacking players with any flair circa 2012? We've got Schürrle and Salah now. They're obviously struggling in a squad that's pushing to be with the world's best, but don't doubt for a second that our squad - both the XI and subs - have come a long way in a short period of time.

- Last season, all 3 of our strikers were clearly not able to make any sort of sustained, meaningful impact in our title charge. Remy is our #2 or #3 striker this year, depending on how you look at it, and probably would've been first choice last year had he been here. 

The quality of our depth may not be sufficient to challenge the elite of European football, but I completely reject any suggestion that this squad is the thinnest in terms of our quality. Remember the days when we strung together Mikel and Ramires as our first choice pivot? Now they're distinctly behind a world class pairing of Matic and Fabregas. 

We've upgraded large parts of our squad quality wise since the turn of this decade, and whilst there's still obvious way to go, it's certainly not our weakest squad by any measure.",null,0,null,1422276038,null,0,1422276368,0,co173x4,null,t3_2tpdv6,null,t1_co173x4,null,t1_co16r15,null,null,null,1424384633,null,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5,null

The ending of NB probably does have the double meaning of North Britain and Nota Bene, that production rather over-emphasised that.

The social implications of this are that Mr Thomas Cardew is of the proper class, as he owned a prestigious London address, a country retreat (Dorking), and a Scottish estate. As Lady Bracknell says; ""Three addresses always inspire confidence"".

There's definite mockery of upper-class Londeners attitude toward Scotland; ""the Sporran"" is obviously ridiculous as a name, and use of ""North Britain"" would have been used for postal addresses, ""Scotland"" is the usual geographic identifier.

Identifying somebody by listing addresses as if for delivering post is **not** normal conversation, this is all satire. Jack is effectively presenting Lady Bracknell with Cecily's social curriculum vitae  (or ""resume"", as if applying for a job). This is obvious later when he says he also has prepared a list of other personal details including vaccinations. The facts he presents are obviously sufficient to ensure she's not *disqualified*, but aren't sufficiently strong to get Lady Bracknell's attention until money is mentioned.

Signing up for something is an indication of a belief, not the action of a terrorist.

The Green party rule came about during the times of the ANC, and we know how that worked out.

But think about the McCarthy era in the United States. Is that what we want? Witch hunts because of people's beliefs alone?

The stance of most liberals is that membership of an organisation alone is not enough to be a criminal act. It can be a protest, it can be a precursor, but in *itself* it should not be criminal.

Giving them money, helping them, sourcing recruits, yes, all those can remain illegal, but it is not right for a liberal democracy to at any one point in time dictate what *beliefs* are acceptable within it.
