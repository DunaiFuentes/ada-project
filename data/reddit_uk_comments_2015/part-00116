For the record - I *do* despise Islam.  I'm an atheist and criticizing religions is fair game to me.  Actually, I feel the same way about radical feminism and I think *all* ideas and ideologies should be open to fearless criticism.  

I strongly dislike Islam not out of xenephobia, but because I think it's a truly awful religious ideology, which is causing harm to many, but most of all muslims themselves.  You may certainly disagree with that point of view, but it is a point of view which I can and will defend.

Does this color my views?  As always, opponents will tend to see contrary opinions as being unfair and biased.  But that's true in any argument.

Am I unfairly using my comments on gays to savage feminism and Islam?  I don't think so.  I think it's an entirely valid criticism of current left-wing thought that support of Islam is wholly incompatible with support for gay rights.  And I think it's also valid to discuss the fact that there are more and more homosexuals who are voicing serious objections to feminism.

You're not very good at coming to conclusions. As evidenced by the fact that some incredibly weak and expected circumstantial evidence implicates Knox or Sollecito in your mind.

Gosh, did they find Knox's DNA in the flat? I wonder if it was because she lived there? Nah can't be. Gosh did they find a knife in Sollecito's kitchen? It must be the murder weapon even though it's nothing like the murder weapon and Knox must have done it because they found some DNA on it that might be hers and she couldn't have possibly have got her own DNA on it by using it in his kitchen.

Oh and she acted in a manner I wouldn't have expected someone to have acted after having her housemate murdered, being called a whore in the international press and being convicted of Kercher's murder and because I am an expert on human behaviour in every single circumstance I know for sure that she's definitely guilty.

Also, who is Rudy Guede? Actually, no, I don't care. It doesn't matter if there was a mass of evidence that he did it and that he admitted to it and that he implicated Knox and Sollecito on the direction of the investigators in exchange for a reduced sentence.

Starbuck being a female instead of a male in the remake of Battlestar Galactica had no bearing on the quality of character. Neither did the fact that Craig's Bond is blond. Iron Man 3's interpretation of The Mandarin was one of the best things about it.

When making an adaptation, you need to adapt. Create an interesting spin on an established character. Whether that means changing the background of a character. Changing the tone of the character like Craig's Bond did making the films a lot more grounded and serious. Or changing the characters accent. 

Aesthetics shouldn't hold back certain interpretations of a character. Otherwise the franchise will just stagnate and die. If Brosnan had done another campy piece of crap after Die Another Day, the Bond franchise would have died.

The same thing has been suggested to me and others I know - including one family of four who had it suggested to them that, facing eviction, they could sofa-surf at friend's houses while the council found them somewhere else to live.

I don't hear comedy, though. I hear two people reading from scripts going round in circles. One of them has to in order to retain her job and the other is making a cheap political point. 

For those who stuck the video out to the bitter end, they will have seen a page of details, stating how the JCP **should** have helped (I hate the word ""should"", btw. If I could delete one word from the english language, it's ""should"". You do it or you don't do it, don't ever bleat on about what **should** happen because, well, it's not, and you whinging abut it isn't going to make it happen. /rant)...which pretty much deliberately ignores the fact we all know these days - that the JCP is *not* there to help you. Many many times I've had it stated to me - in ten years of on-off unemployment - that everything you actually want them to do, you have to do yourself.

They asked me what my barriers were to finding work. My experience is in the IT industry, so I told them I needed to update my skills. They laughed at me and said they couldn't help. If I'd said I wanted to be a brickie or a security guard, they'd have put me on a course that afternoon.

So I went out and found a course for myself and asked them to pay for the course - some £2000. They ummed and ahhed and told me about the circus of hoops I'd have to jump through - including three separate decision makers at national, regional and individual jobcentre level.

I asked them flat out, at my initial interview, what help they'd give me - thinking CV help, cover letter advice, trade paper access, targetted jobsearch with local contacts...They clearly and directly stated that they were **not** going to help me at all.

There may be ways that this bloke could have been helped with travel costs byt he JCP, but there's no way on god's green earth that they're actually going to do it, and everyone knows that.

The conversation is egregious nonsense and does more to damage the point the caller is trying to make, rather than helping anyone.

Edit: When I say that they won't help, I mean with stuff that only JCP can do - like structured jobsearches using their systems, like putting me in touch with organisations who only work with JCP referrals, like access to their discretionary fund so I've got an outfit to attend an interview in...",null,1,null,1427548730,null,0,1427549859,0,cpti49v,null,t3_30kcdb,null,t1_cpti49v,null,t3_30kcdb,null,null,null,1432061661,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Yes, but this is one of the fundamental arguments against regulating free-speech.  We *can't* be sure that some of today's outrageous speech might not turn out to be tomorrow's truth.  

For instance - I remember casually dismissing stories of muslim rape gangs on twitter as likely motivated by far-right racism.  And perhaps they *were* being spread by racists.  And yet, the stories turned out to have at least some element of truth.  Similarly, I recall thinking that accusations against Jimmy Saville were likely tabloid-level smears.  And I bet I could find more examples - speech that seemed obviously wrong and offensive at the time but which later turned out to be partially correct.

There's also the worry that however well you think the speech laws are currently working - such laws are notoriously susceptible to political manipulation and it's not impossible that one day you could find out that it's *your* speech which has become targeted.

Modern Western Christianity is, by and large, more tolerant than  Islam. But then most places in the world where Islam is practised are much poorer and less well educated than the West. 

Both faiths have violent books that need to be interpreted allegorically to survive in modern society.

I'd expect electricity costs of about £15 per month for the first person and about £10 per month for each additional person. This is for a reasonably frugal household - i.e. no big screen TVs or uber gaming PCs or stuff like that. Just a laptop each, some energy efficient lighting, a modest TV, etc.

For an all electric house, I don't see how under £40 a month for the first person, and £15 a month for each other is realistically achievable, unless everyone is out all day and you keep penguins as pets.

The big costs are things with heaters in - any water heated electrically (electric showers, immersion heaters) are monster consumers.  Electric central heating or panel heaters (not storage heaters) will bankrupt you. I live alone in a modest flat, but the LL installed an electric boiler and radiators - last Winter, I was having to wear jumpers and thermal socks indoors to get the electricity bill below £120 per month.

The commonest ""phantom"" electricity consumer is an immersion heater left on - maybe the boiler was a bit iffy, so someone turned on the immersion for hot water. They can easily chew through £70 per month, and no one will notice until the get the bill. Obviously, if you have a combi boiler, then this isn't an issue.

Electric showers are expensive to run - budget for around £1.50 per hour of shower time. If you like a long hot shower, then going from 5 minutes once a day to 15 minutes twice a day, can add over £15 a month to the bill.

Yes it is.  But I used that specific example because it's something which we could all agree should be acceptable but which would be considered offensive to some religious conservatives.  

So, the question is - who gets to decide?  As another thought experiment - If muslims decide that a shop selling copies of Charlie Hebdo with Mohammed on the cover is absolutely beyond the pale then how do we arbitrate such things?  

One way is to try to sort out the good speech from the bad and then ban the really bad speech - perhaps through voting or through consulting wise men.  But, I think that all such attempts are doomed to failure.  

There is only one effective way of sorting the good ideas from the bad - and that is to subject them to criticism and debate where nobody has the final say.

null,false,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,null,"I agree, when I lived in the UK I liked Morrison's far more than Tesco or Sainsbury's. I felt like I could always get a good deal there due to the large quantities of fresh produce from the in house Butchers and Fishmongers.  Cooking for one it really suited me since I could pick up a small steak or salmon fillet for just a couple of quid to eat for dinner that night. It really suited that the meat wasn't all cut to the same size unlike elsewhere where it's all the same and vacuum sealed. Then again I don't know how that worked out if you were buying for a big family. Tesco always felt like a huge rip off where if you weren't buying loss leaders you were getting screwed. 

Now shopping in Germany is very different, they don't but anything like the level of effort into presentation in here. The only factors seems to be price and quality. For this reason they don't have a large value range except on some essentials, because the food is assumed to be 'Gut und Günstig' (Good quality and good value) already. Germans are definitely savvy buyers, but aren't so interested in getting stuff cheap but buying quality at the best cost. It's about a stable supply of food of fair quality for a fair price. British supermarket customers seem to more focussed on loss leading deals, general discounts and brand marketing. Anecdotally this is really obviously true here, recently I wanted to buy a cheap mop. Now in the UK I would just go to pound(insert word here) and buy some cheap Chinese made plastic, but in Germany is was a struggle, everywhere I went they were selling 20 euro mops with 10 year guarantees in a stainless steel finish, but no budget mops in the predictable places. (the German for mop is 'der Bodenwischer' if you're curious). This mentality is even reflected in the German language where 'Günstig' means something like 'value for money', and 'Billig' means something like 'cheap and tacky'.

Ultimately I think the big supermarkets in the UK just weren't prepared for the impact of the recession on British purchasing habits. Germans, the economic conservative savers that they are, have supermarket practices that more recession orientated at all times. 

With the recession British purchasers also moved away from branding to a degree.  For example Tesco was set up to offer either Kelloggs branded Coco pops at a few quid a box, or Tesco Value blue and white packaging Chocolate flavoured rice cereal at 1/4 the price. One was considered expensive, the other was considered cheap and nasty.  Aldi however would offer something between the two which would be of sufficient quality but not deliberately appear cheap. A large segment of the British market decided it wanted as much quality as the lowest price  it was available, rather than being split between cheap and low quality vs branded quality and pricey, and Aldi offered this compromise successfully. I also think people started to prefer consistently spending 20% less on their weekly shop rather than being subject to the limited time offer culture that's prominent amongst British supermarkets. After all that 20% weekly saving is something you can budget for, but you can't rely on buying up Pizza Express brand pizzas when they're 50% off. Of course this is why we saw the introduction of a third tier of products in the main supermarkets, the higher tier of own brand stuff that comes in nice packaging but isn't as expensive as branded.

Finally I think Aldi did a good job of rebranding itself in the UK. When I was a child Aldi was considered the skidrow of supermarkets, up there with Farmfoods and Iceland in terms of cheap food. Back then it felt like these were budget supermarkets for families with not enough money coming in and lots of kids to feed. However nowadays I hear typical middle class types proudly saying how they go to Aldi for the bulk stuff and Waitrose to top up on luxury items.

This is kind of the problem with the club at the moment, our top 5 earners (Gerrard 140k, Sturridge 130k, Johnson 110k, Balotelli 100k and Lallana 80k) have had a kinda bad past 10 months~.. none of them have done anything notable this season really... add in the factor that Gerrard and Johnson are leaving which frees up£250k/week and it's no surprise that Sterling's agent wants £150k/week as he has been one of our most important players the last 2 seasons.

Some people point at Coutinho's new contract (£75k/week) but seriously I feel like the club did him over on that, he'd get double that everywhere else and I fear clubs will be after him this summer.

Compared to what other players are on in the Prem.. Coutinho and Sterling are probably worth about £120-130k at the moment

I remember when, 10 years ago, a blond James Bond (and someone who didn't look too posh) was something groundbreaking and ""somewhere it's never gone before"". Craig was also 38 and pretty much unknown. The age was still a surprise to some as I thought they had wanted a to cast a 30 year old instead. Elba is 42 and a household name with a whole host of prior roles he is associated as. Especially if you've watched Luther. A clean break this would not be. 

Except for the fact he's black. That's it. That is the reason why it gets floated and that's the reason why you see lefty papers support it and you'll see the Daily Mail disapprove. Something new and exciting to explore new boundaries! /s Certainly we can all agree that it causes debate! That's good for the papers, that's good for advertising but is it good for the people involved? Is it good for the long term brand?

Ian Fleming did not write James Bond as anything other than white. James Bond has been portrayed by six white actors (and more in non film adaptions). James Bond is a cultural institution, just as Dr Who and Top Gear are; the worldwide reach and revenue are massive. As are their depictions of British culture and identity. That's why it's a point of debate and it gets people so wound up! 

Roger Moore is 87 years old and since from when he was born to two thousand years before that a 'Briton', an 'Anglo-Saxon', a 'Celt' and a 'Scot' were all clear ethnicities and cultures. Yes, Britain has changed this past century and Elba (like many others) was born and raised in London but if you stepped foot out of London you'd realise that the previous British ethnicity and culture are still alive and kicking! He is certainly a Londoner and British but he cannot be as English as someone whose family have been here a magnitude longer and there's nothing wrong with that; I thought we were told not to think in absolutes! 

This tricky issue of identity is in that it is a good thing that in this multi-racial country we live in (that didn't exist 87 years ago) to have common values, heroes and interests. But the replacement of white British institutions in favour of something else is unfair and new characters should be created that show that Black can be British rather than British is Black. 

Finally, money and global identity. A good film should hopefully sell well despite racial controversy but when Selma (a quintessentially Black identity film) makes $60m and American Sniper (a quintessentially red state American film) makes $600m I have to wonder why movie executives are more interested in pushing boundaries rather than celebrate existing identity - or at least celebrate all the money they'll make! This goes beyond our own particular countries though; who is James Bond to an Indian, a Chinese, a Brazilian, a continental European? He is white, he is posh and he is British. These stereotypes, cultural brands really, are useful and are described as 'soft power' - cultural influence.

It's all good fun to scapegoat Farage with his slightly quirky personality and the fact he is mentions immigration. 
He may have crossed your lines on a political level (despite not carrying out anything as he's not even in power!). 
Sure, protest away during his office hours but attacking him verbally in the presence of his family during a sunday dinner seems all too far to me for a man who isn't even in power. 
    The irony of all this.... The protesters are left wing liberals who would be happy if the greens came into power also support a policy to not make it illegal to be part of any extremist group. Therefore the irony of green party members protesting Nigel Farage for a few comments that aren't even that right wing is pure hypocritical. 

   Instead of just barely scratching the surface and reading headline gossip from major news sources scapegoating Farage, why not look a bit deeper into who the real evil people are that are actually in a position of power that are creating laws that protect the rich.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Ah defamation... not one of the UK's best laws as it is complex and a nightmare to defend against, even if you win it can be an expensive process to be involved in. Overall, I would not wish anyone to be on the receiving end of a defamation claim (although some recent reforms have improved the situation).

However, how serious are these guys? Is their notice from a lawyer or not? It sounds to me like they may be blustering? This is the big 'if' in this whole scenario.

Anyway, at its heart defamation is Mr A saying something to Mr B, about Mr C, which would cause damage to Mr C's reputation/professional standing etc. 

Fortunately, a recent amendment to the law means the company you reivewed would need to show your review caused it is likely to cause them ""serious harm"" (in a financial sense) - which is tough to show. However, if they show your review caused them such harm that is all they need to do. You have to raise and show a defence and this puts you on the backfoot. Two common defences are ""what I said was true"" and ""it was an opinion which I honestly and reasonably held and explained the basis of"".

What you said appears to be a mixture of both statements of fact and opinion. If they do claim against you, you may have to defend each statement you made. Now, you don't have to win every point if your review was substantially true (eg if I said ""Mr A was convicted of murder and stole a chocolate bar"", but only the murder bit was true I am ok as the extra incorrect theft allegation is not going to cause any additional reputational damage) but it could be a lot of work. 

Overall, I would be surprised if they did bother with court action. If they do try seek proper professional advice immediately (damages for defamation can be hefty). You could stand a good chance of defending yourself (the amandment I spoke of works in your favour) but you obviously can't give us all the facts here. However, given how much hassle these things can be if they really are serious the wiser option may be to give in and save yourself the time and money...",null,0,null,1427556039,null,0,1427556648,0,cptkt41,null,t3_30lj62,null,t1_cptkt41,null,t3_30lj62,null,null,null,1432062928,null,2,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

&gt;As of January 2015 [update], there are 97 episodes unaccounted for from 26 serials, including 10 full serials. By far the majority of the missing episodes are from seasons 3, 4, and 5, which have a total of 79 episodes currently missing. Of the 26 serials which comprised seasons 3-5, only five (*[The Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ark_(Doctor_Who\))*, *[The Gunfighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gunfighters)*, and *[The War Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Machines)* from season 3, and *[The Tomb of the Cybermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomb_of_the_Cybermen)* and *[The Enemy of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemy_of_the_World)* from season 5) exist in their entirety in the TV archives, leaving a total of 21 with at least one episode missing. By contrast, seasons 1, 2, and 6 have only 18 episodes missing in total from a total of 5 serials, with 19 of them complete. All but three of the missing stories have clips of various lengths surviving from different sources, with *[Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(Doctor_Who\))*, ""[Mission to the Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_to_the_Unknown)"", and *[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Massacre_of_St_Bartholomew%27s_Eve)* having no surviving footage whatsoever. While the Patrick Troughton era has more episodes missing (53 as compared to 44 for the William Hartnell era), there are more Hartnell stories completely missing (6 as compared to 4). Serials highlighted in   red  are missing all episodes. Serials highlighted in   yellow  are missing more than half of their episodes. All others listed are missing at least one, but no more than half, of their episodes.

Worldwide yes, locally and historically Catholics couldn't vote, own land etc., then later you had gerrymandering, poor education, Catholics being paid less and generally lower class etc.

This all stems from the initial invasion by the English and attempts to subjugate Ireland. Ultimately Catholicism was an easy way to differentiate between ""Irish who are Irish"" and ""Irish who we put there/joined our side"". If it weren't religion it would have been something else.

Also you don't seriously believe the Troubles were fought over the minute differences in religious beliefs right?

between the 30million work force thats £10 each.  It's not as though it's getting pissed away on a frivolous expenditure, it's getting spent on people that really need medical care.  When 99.07% of our taxes being funnelled into the NHS are being spent on us, I think we can afford that last little bit to accommodate the poorest and neediest ... whether that economically or whether thats because their hospitals at home aren't as well equipped to help them.

In the great scheme of things, when you're talking about such large amounts of money, you have to think what those amount mean relatively, and when it's only 0.3% that is relatively nothing.  £300million may be a lot individually, but collectively it isn't

&gt;

&gt;The __Principality of Wales__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Tywysogaeth Cymru*) existed between 1216 and 1536, encompassing two-thirds of modern [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) during its height between 1267–1277. For most of its history it was ""annexed and united"" to the English Crown. However, for a few generations, specifically the period from its foundation in 1216 to [Edward I's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England) completion of the conquest of Wales in 1284, it was *de facto* independent under a Welsh [Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales), albeit one who swore [fealty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty) to the [King of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs).

&gt;The Principality was formally founded in 1216 at the [Council of Aberdyfi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gwynedd_during_the_High_Middle_Ages#Aberdyfi.2C_Worcester.2C_and_Strata_Florida.3B_1216.E2.80.931240) and later recognised by the 1218 [Treaty of Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great#Treaty_of_Worcester_and_border_campaigns_1218.E2.80.931229) between [Llywelyn the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great) of Wales and [Henry III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_England) of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).    The treaty gave substance to the political reality of 13th century Wales and England, and the relationship of the former with the [Angevin Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_Empire). The principality retained a great degree of autonomy, characterized by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of *[Cyfraith Hywel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Law)*, and by the increasingly sophisticated [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_regis) of the [House of Aberffraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Aberffraw). Although it owed [fealty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty) to the Angevin king of England, the principality was *[de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto)* independent, with a similar status in the empire to the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland).  Its existence has been seen as proof that all the elements necessary for the growth of Welsh [statehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) were in place. 

&gt;The period of *de facto* independence ended with [Edward I's conquest of the Principality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Wales_by_Edward_I) between 1277 and 1283. Under the [Statute of Rhuddlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Rhuddlan) the Principality lost its independence and became effectively an annexed territory of the English crown. From 1301, the crown's lands in north and west Wales formed part of the [appanage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appanage) of England's heir apparent, with the title ""[Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales)"". On accession of the Prince to the English throne, the lands and title became merged with the Crown again. On two occasions Welsh claimants to the title rose up in rebellion during this period, although neither ultimately succeeded.

Except this is all proven to be lies on her part and US media spin about it that is still continuing (it makes a much better story right?).  

She had an interpreter present during the interview (Anna Domino) and Knox testified in court that she was given food and drink.  The interview was also at most 2 hours long and even her lawyer Luciano Ghirga rejected the claims that she was ever hit by police stating in court “We never said she was hit”.   Part of her sentence when she was found guilty was for slander against the Italian police involved and that is something that was never disputed by her legal team.

Is it possible she gave a false confession?  Yes well she absolutely did at first when she accused Patrick Lumumba (after she found out that Sollecito withdrew her alibi) and said she was there when he killed her (who by the way had argued with Knox and told her to go home from her shift at the bar she worked at and then texted her telling her not to come in for the next one).  The only time she admitted this wasn't true about Lumumba murdering Meredith was in a recorded conversation to her mother in jail (which she didn't know was being recorded) and her mother never passed this information on to the police.  It also continued to be very much factually incorrect and incompatible with Sollectito's version of events on many points after she lawyered up and had time to self edit, calm down and mentally review her movements and made a new statement after Lumumba was released.

null,false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"Well, ""path of least resistance"" is actually a bit of a simplification. Consider water flowing: it doesn't know ahead of time which way it goes, it just flows forwards and finds the way as it goes. Now, water does this by the pull of gravity or suction, in artificial systems.

Electricity flows through the least resistive materials it can find: where ever there are holes for the electrons to fill they'll try to fill them. More holes = less resistance.

Given two parallel circuits, one with higher resistance than the other, electricity will flow through both. *More* will flow through the less resistive path because there are more holes, but eventually current flows through the higher one as well because the number of holes available on the lower resistance branch gets filled up by larger flow of electrons.

It ""finds"" the least resistive path by flowing down whatever paths it can find. Electrons following in the flow of current keep following up, going down whatever path is least congested.

As such, electrons spilling out of a damaged cable looking to go to ground won't be going upwards into the water and the fish when there's ground all around them with essentially infinite holes to fill up.

Edit: To take an ""electrocution in the bath"" analysis, your body has more holes than the surrounding water, so in flow the electrons.

null,false,DrTenochtitlan,null,null,null,"This is a great question that lots of people have considered before. There are a couple of answers at play here, involving a couple of rules from the classic series.

 The Blinovich Limitation Effect came up in several classic episodes, and basically explained that you cannot cross your own timeline without extreme danger. Physical contact with an earlier version of yourself can be disastrous and cause a massive paradox. We saw some of the consequences of this in the Ninth Doctor episode ""Father's Day"". When the Time Lords were around, they used to be able to control and mitigate the damage if this occurred. (This was also discussed in ""Father's Day"".) However, since being placed inside the Time Lock during the Time War, they are no longer able to intervene and clean up any problems from such circumstances. 

Now, because of time travel technology, Time Lords obviously have the potential to violate this rule. That is why the Time Lords also came up with the Laws of Time, which are both legal and moral. We only know one of these laws by name - The First Law of Time. This law stated that it was forbidden for Time Lords to meet outside of temporal sequence. This law not only forbade individual Time Lords from meeting themselves in the past or future, but it forbade the Time Lord race from interfering in its own past or future. Likewise, under certain circumstances, this law could also apply to interference that would greatly alter the past or future of *any* planet. Now, since this was just a legal pronouncement, the rule *could* be broken. Sometimes, this was accidental, as in ""The Two Doctors"". Other times, it could be intentional in a grave situation, such as in ""The Three Doctors"" or ""The Day of the Doctor"". 

Throughout the series, we've seen disastrous consequences from ordinary people meeting themselves (Rose in ""Father's Day"", the Brigadier in ""Mawdryn Undead"", etc.). However, if the Doctor meets a past incarnation of himself, rather than the *same* incarnation, it is believed that this sort of ""tricks"" the universe into thinking that he is two different people, thus mitigating the temporal effects of the Blinovich Limitation Effect. It is still not wise and potentially dangerous, but since the Time Lords have special knowledge of time, it is generally accepted that it is possible to get away with it. Once the various versions of the Doctor separate, all but the most recent version of the Doctor experience amnesia of the event. This also seems to be a consequence of the Blinovich Limitation Effect, affecting Time Lords less severely.

(2)Without prejudice to subsection (1) above, a person who, when in charge of a [F1mechanically propelled vehicle] which is on a road or other public place, is unfit to drive through drink or drugs is guilty of an offence.

(3)For the purposes of subsection (2) above, a person shall be deemed not to have been in charge of a [F1mechanically propelled vehicle] if he proves that at the material time the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of his driving it so long as he remained unfit to drive through drink or drugs.

(4)The court may, in determining whether there was such a likelihood as is mentioned in subsection (3) above, disregard any injury to him and any damage to the vehicle.

(5)For the purposes of this section, a person shall be taken to be unfit to drive if his ability to drive properly is for the time being impaired.

I would imagine that the NI law is similar.

Basically you are in charge of the vehicle, you have access to the keys, the clutch, handbrake and breaks. You can control the vehicle, so you are drunk and in charge.

It was uncanny, both me and a colleague noticed constant tweaking and 'pointing' of phones towards us - we chose not to mention it or try to ban or block recording.. After all, why would my advice change? I'm acting with integrity and honesty, on the record or not the outcome wouldn't be different. I know this is ideal, and most managers (like your one) won't put their money where their mouth is.

I'd record it, or even better just ask outright if you can; and whether they mind? Have a witness there with you, (do you have unions at your workplace?) and then be open about it. Your manager would be hard pressed to decline recording under this circumstance, as the implication is that they are about to do something bad.

Legally, it's totally admissible. Phones and recording devices are ubiquitous; so courts can't deny their accuracy and evidential value. Here's a case where someone even [secretly recorded the adjournment of a hearing](http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2014/03/20/secret-recordings-at-disciplinary-hearings-can-be-evidence.aspx) which in my view is a bit cheeky - but hey-ho, they need to be being honest in any case. It influenced the outcome of their tribunal, and the court took it as evidence.

/u/uglecom 's comments about the work relationship are very important too. There's no coming back from this if you start recording things. 

Weigh it up, are you at the point of no return? Have you lost all trust in the manager to be able to conduct an open and honest conversation now?

From now on though - do ask for a 'friend' in any meeting. They can sit and observe, or by agreement take minutes of the meeting. After all, this benefits everyone right?

Leviticus is a set of laws setting punishments for various things to be considered crimes.  Even in the societies that practiced these laws, you didn't just murder people you saw breaking them - rather, they were subjected to legal judgement first.

As such, the more relevant description would be calling for the death penalty for homosexuality.  That may seem a fairly fine distinction, since that's still a pretty horrible statement, but I think it's an important one, and I don't think we should be restricting speech about what people want out of the political and legal system, regardless of how stupid, offensive and wrongheaded we consider them.  For a start, stopping the speech isn't stopping the belief, and may even assist in forming echo chambers of such idiots, by creating a matyr complex, and removing it from the visibility, and thus counterarguments and ridicule it deserves.  Further, it's not a program that has any hope of succeeding anyway, and the existance of such idiocy is probably going to make people *less* favourably disposed to such speech.  If it *does* actually become more of a problem, it'll at least be one we know about.

I'm opposed to the death penalty, but I think people should still be able to talk, campaign and argue for it (and likewise be talked at, campaigned against and argued with).  I don't think someone saying ""Murderers should be hanged"" is the same as ""Let's lynch that guy - he's a murderer"", and I think it's an important distinction to make.

And the rewards await those wise enough to take full advantage of cheaper surplus energy.

This is actually a problem engineered into the system by wind power. Wind power is inserted into the grid whether it's wanted or not completely at random. There's a burden in both having too little energy, and an oversupply on the grid. When there's too little energy they have to fire up gas and oil. When there's too much, coal and gas stations have their breakers tripped.

Because of this unreliability, National Grid (and the other EU supergrids) have to find solutions; the winning one at the moment is variable rate tariffs through the 'smart grid'.

For a counter example, I offer you this: would altering the character's gender change it unacceptably? I'd say it would: one of his fundamental characteristics has been his womanizing, with a sizeable addition of chauvinism depending on the incarnation; in the context of our culture, having a female character doing the same wouldn't be credible.

Actually no, we don't ""deserve to know"" something just because the government is keeping certain information from us.

There are lots of things that they rightly keep out of the public domain either because they pertain to policy decisions that have/have not been made, foreign policy stances or information critical to our national security.

You don't ""deserve to know"" who our spies are and where they are located, you don't ""deserve to know"" the locations of our nuclear submarines, you don't ""deserve to know"" what the Foreign Secretary truly thinks of the President of Indonesia and you don't ""deserve to know"" what operations your local Police are planning against organised crime in your local towns and cities.

There are a whole host of things that the government rightly keeps under a tight lid; you don't fundamentally have a right to know something just because the government keeps it a secret from you.

&gt; The electorate being willingly ignorant is one thing, but the state deliberately hiding its actions from us, to the extent that it persecutes somebody who shares these secrets, that is something that I cannot tolerate.

As I've explained, keeping state secrets comes with the territory in some jobs.

Our diplomats may not personally agree with our foreign policy stances and our Police officers may not personally agree with our national policy on drugs or immigration offences but we still to expect them to keep secret the information that is entrusted to them otherwise they shouldn't be in the job to begin with.

It is is not their place to decide whether or not this information should be in the public domain. Other than ""knowing"" what any intelligent person had guessed years ago, we have gained nothing from this and instead given away the deepest technical secrets of our intelligence services to hostile foreign powers, undermining the work of our own agents and and actively advancing the interests and countermeasures of theirs.

You're right in that the video maker makes no other argument than he hasn't got the money to catch a bus, though, and this is the reason I think it's just a poor attempt to make a political point. If you're canny enough to make a post to youtube, you're canny enough to mention **why** you need to catch a bus...also, the JCP callcentre people are looking for magic phrases that, when you utter them, you can actually get more help. If he'd mentioned a disability, or the distance he has to travel, or if he'd asked to be put through to his jobcentre to talk to the advisor directly, he would have got much further than just stupidly repeating ""I've got no money"".

To a point, you're right to criticise the video maker, **but** you're wrong to assume OP and the youtuber are the same person and you've missed an important and obvious point if you *actually* think he's got no money for bus fare.

The more we move on in years, the more any Bond film set around realtime can't maintain this fiction.

Craig has one more film at least before retiring as Bond; Idris Elba might take the mantle around 2020, at which point even a 50 year old Bond would have been born in 1970, reached adulthood in 1988 and served in the Cold War for a very short time.",null,0,null,1427566201,null,0,false,0,cptpp86,null,t3_30krdf,null,t1_cptpp86,null,t1_cptgrsk,null,null,null,1432065304,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,phys1cs,null,null,null,"Keeping it in the 123 account is probably the best bet. With a low, irregular income as a student, you really don't want to be locking money up for too long or exposing yourself to much volatility. Investment gains over 3-4 years are likely to be pretty small anyway (could easily be negative over that timescale), and your income should increase by a lot once you graduate. As ~~advice~~ guidance from somebody who can remember being in your position and knows a lot of people who've made life needlessly difficult for themselves:

 * Other than student loans (which are really more like a tax), try to stay out of debt. Cheap overdrafts for students and recent graduates do exist, but graduating with debt can be a major handicap once you have to find a job, move across the country, buy a car, pay a deposit to a landlord, pay bills, buy furniture and do all the other stuff that tends to come up when you enter the 'real world'. Interest rates and fees ramp up once you've graduated, just as a bunch of other big expenses come along. A very large fraction of students end up with big overdrafts, and plenty also have credit card debt. Many end up taking on more credit card debt on graduating. Seriously, avoid this.

 * If you can, avoid having a job during term times. It's not always possible, but as a physics student your workload will be relatively high, and you'll presumably also want to have a bit of fun. There really isn't enough time to do well in a science degree, have a social life, have a job and sleep. Lots of students do have part-time jobs, but they're often not doing the hardest degrees and it can easily mean missing out on some great experiences and/or getting poor grades. A pot of cash can tide you over during term time, assuming you also...

 * Get a proper summer job, and do some work in the other holidays as well. If you're proactive and start engaging with companies early on (like, in the first term of your degree), you shouldn't have much trouble getting a decent placement in industry for the summer months, and these usually pay upwards of £1k a month. Don't just wait until the penultimate year of uni. This will also seriously help with getting a graduate job later on, so it's a great investment all round. Take a couple of weeks off for a holiday if you like, but don't assume the long summer is just free time (many students do). Bar work, retail, manual labour etc. are all fine if you need the money, but the benefits of doing something relevant to your degree are immense. 

 * Avoid stupid spending. By all means go out and have a few drinks, but don't buy champagne for the whole bar. Sounds obvious, but the number of morons who manage to burn through half of their student loan in freshers week is astonishing. 

I haven't said anything about investments, because there's not much point really. Theoretically it's good to start as early as possible, but as a student your priorities should be elsewhere. Liquidity and the ability to borrow cheaply *for short periods in unexpected circumstances* are more important. You probably won't accumulate enough cash for there to be much benefit to an ISA - interest rates are better from current accounts and the real advantage of an ISA is building up tax-free income for the long term. The advantage is negligible if you only keep a couple of grand in it. Focus on getting a good degree, getting relevant work experience (that should also pay) and making the most of the uni experience. Graduating with a good job offer (or funded postgraduate degree) and no debt other than student loans is the thing to aim for.",null,0,null,1427567128,null,0,false,0,cptq634,null,t3_30lek8,null,t1_cptq634,null,t3_30lek8,null,null,null,1432065525,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

Sturridge is undeniably 1st choice.
Balotelli/Origi will be fighting for that second place, Balo isn't leaving LFC according to his agent
Borini will most definitely be sold, and if we end up buying another striker, it'll be a guy who is young and unproven at EPL, or hey, I know it's prolly a long shot but with Jerome Sinclair being loaned out one could possibly make the case for him to be used a backup option along with Lambert, again, it's far fetched and a long shot, just assuming at this point really.

But it's set in stone that no one that is considered world-class striker will be joining LFC this summer.

&gt;The 'creation of a million jobs' is bullshit - they have succeeded in creating low wage, precarious, zero hours jobs, as well as pushing people into unsustainable self employment.

I just looked it up there are a total of 697000 people with a zero hour contract job as their main job. Even if most of the jobs created are low paying jobs I don't really know they have still created more jobs than that. That is still a good thing, not all jobs that are created can be high paying management positions, every country needs workers, you cannot all be management. I was watching a speech by David Cameron, he is very slick, I will give him that apparently they outlawed zero hour contracts that deny you the right to hold more than one job, that is the main issue I can see with them that I can see anyway.

But as I said I am not equipped to know the truth about what you are saying not being in the country. So thank you for giving me your perspective.

I can say this, zero hour contracts, low paying work doesn't matter one bit to me if it was in my country. I would love it for my country. We have no real benefits anyway (example a child care grant you would get roughly 20 pounds a month here, roughly translates to 10 loaves of bread in cost of living). We have 25% unemployment and another 25% employed only part time or seasonally.

I like your concept of what happens to past regenerations. The character development and scripts are well done. The humor is just the right amount. The film values and the acting are good.  There are various references to the Classic Doctors. And the Doctor thinking he had regenerated into a Sontaran was too funny.

The Doctor is the greatest hero anywhere in time and space. He has seen the birth of the Universe and he has witnessed its end. The is one he chose for himself, as a promise to himself, it means ""Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in."" 

Doctor Who is the longest running sci-fi show according to the Guinness Book of World Records. 

The character and the show are popular worldwide. It has been broadcast outside of the UK since 1964 where it is popular across Europe, in Latin America, Japan, Canada, and the United States. 

Doctor Who has inspired generations of scientists and students. Naming a feature of the solar system after the show's iconic hero will immediately draw attention to the mission, and it will inspire a whole new generation to become interested in science. 

The Doctor's vessel, the T.A.R.D.I.S., is already under consideration, and so is his home world, Gallifrey.

Check the wording of the policy - it may be worth getting if it will cover any procedures you think you might want / need doing over the course of your internship.

2) There is a point to a pension scheme - free money!  Again, check the wording of the scheme.  If you put in 6% and your employer puts in the same amount - that's like getting a pay rise.  Which you can't take until you retire...

That tiny amount of money that you put away will - hopefully - continue to grow, even after you've left the internship.  You can transfer it to any future pension plan you may have.

I understand that sooner or later there will be a leaking roof, or random repairs, but to be honest I've never had a preferred electrician, plumber, or similar!  So I'd be hoping that any agency I did pick to represent me had a good few local contacts that they'd trust.  I've certainly seen from reading around that a lot of the management companies will charge you a fee on top of any repairs, pretty much for scheduling/managing it.  But I guess that's the reason why they're there - so I don't have to get involved, especially from a different city.

When it came to the income did you or they set the price, both that the tenant pays and that you receive?  I assume that we'd have to trust them to know what is a fair price, to make sure the place isn't sitting empty for long periods of time.

null,false,caseym4,null,null,null,"“Chelsea scouts will be in attendance.” It was a siren call that no ten-year-old boy could resist when the note came home from primary school. So there we were, wary parents shepherding excited children into a teeming sports hall one Sunday.
We walked in to find a frenzy of small-sided games. Give boys an hour to prove themselves a budding Eden Hazard or Diego Costa, and the evidence is that it quickly becomes a back-heel and step-over convention.
Casting anxious glances to see if any of the coaches had spotted their skills, they finished red-faced with effort. They were soon being ushered off to allow the next bunch on to the conveyor belt.
The session was run by a private coaching outfit with Chelsea’s blessing — the Barclays Premier League club hoping to unearth the odd special kid, the company trying to sign you up to holiday camps on the way out — and it felt part of an industrial-scale sieving process.
It came with a blunt conclusion that only a lucky handful would be picked out, and the head coach warning rather starkly that if you were not in an academy aged ten, it was probably time to start abandoning those dreams of being the next Lionel Messi.
Heads dropped — and that was just among the pushy parents — but knowing how much Chelsea put into finding the best talent, and not just in southwest London, that dose of hard reality was not a shock.
Chelsea’s academy is widely regarded as one of the best in the country for its facilities, coaching and ability to attract top talent.
For kids of a certain age, that requires substantial sums of money, and relocating families to leafy Cobham. Chelsea are not alone in the lengths they will go to — when the parents of one boy in Arsenal’s academy said the constant lifts to training were becoming overbearing, the club said they would send a taxi for their child, aged 12 — but they are far more effective than most.
It works. For the fourth successive season, Chelsea Under-18 have reached the final of the FA Youth Cup. No club has enjoyed such sustained success by its teenagers since Manchester United were sending out a youthful Bobby Charlton and Duncan Edwards.
And there is much more evidence of Chelsea’s dominance in this market. Examine the England junior teams picked ahead of this international break, from under-21s to under-16s, and you can see cast-iron proof of what one senior FA coaching figure has described as a reliance on Chelsea. They had 18 boys called for England duty which was not only the most of any Premier League club (five more than Tottenham Hotspur’s 13) but more than Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool put together. It was more than twice the number from Southampton, also recognised as a leader in the teenage field.
And it was not just the numbers but the quality of them: Patrick Bamford (forced to withdraw from the under-21s after excelling recently on loan at Middlesbrough), Lewis Baker (captain of the under-20s), Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Izzy Brown with the under-19s, Dominic Solanke, winner of England’s Youth Player of the Year who was suddenly told to leave the under-18s to train with the senior squad — and scored — this week.
England Under-16 involved as many as five Chelsea players, including Dujon Sterling who will surely cut the mustard.
So when we talk about whether we will get an England team to be proud of — as we frequently do because nothing brings the country together like the national football side, even if it is to be united in frustration — we need to care about what is happening at Chelsea’s academy.
When we ask if England can ever produce a team capable of winning a major tournament, what is happening at Chelsea is a distillation of so many of our hopes and fears. In Chelsea’s academy, we can see the quality which, I believe, reflects a slowly changing culture in England. There are talented kids coming through, if not yet remotely in the numbers required, then certainly with technical abilities which mark them as modern, progressive players, aspiring to be part of a new era.
Yet, with Chelsea more than anywhere in the English game, we also see the perils which Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, has once again been discussing this week with phrases like a “blocked pathway” and “glass ceiling” — terms that are now as much in everyday English football lexicon as “man on”.
While Dyke went oddly silent yesterday at a meeting of Premier League clubs when representatives from Southampton asked him to explain his proposals to enforce more home-grown players, no one can dispute his claim that English youth is struggling to break through into Premier League first teams.
At Chelsea the competition is stiffer than anywhere given the youth ranks feature not only the best of English, and British, but kids from all over the world like Charly Musonda, Andreas Christensen and Jeremie Boga.
José Mourinho does not even try to deny how hard it is to blood young players, talking of how the pressure, the expectations on the first team mean that “this is not the best habitat for a young player to be developed”.
None have made it through since John Terry. Hence the ridiculous frenzy when Loftus-Cheek played just seven minutes in a Champions League dead rubber and one minute against Manchester City.
Chelsea talk of their desire to promote one home-grown player into the first team every 18 months. The culture must change from the top, pulling the talent through.
Will Roman Abramovich demand a punt on youth? This is a question to interest all English supporters when we see the local talent gathered at Chelsea and the risks of blockage, of stagnation.
Yes, these English starlets can be sent out on loan, or sold, but we also know something can be lost in those critical years around 17-20 — and never recovered — if a young player is not exposed to regular, competitive, men’s football; if teenagers are not given first-team responsibility, if they do not follow a sustained path of progress, if they are not trusted but are just tossed away.
So we watch with fascination over the coming months and years to see if any of these English talents so painstakingly recruited by Chelsea are given that chance; the clock ticks, just like it does in the coaches’ room at St George’s Park which counts down to the 2022 World Cup Final when, according to Dyke’s forecast, England are supposed to be triumphant.
It is not nearly as simple to say that if Chelsea fail, England fail — but you only have to look through the youth ranks at Cobham to see that fates of club and country are closely linked.",null,0,null,1427569698,null,0,false,0,cptrgop,null,t3_30m4m0,null,t1_cptrgop,null,t3_30m4m0,null,null,null,1432066135,null,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9,null

[Your thoughts on reforming Islam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/30k371/your_thoughts_on_reforming_islam/)

One of the top comments - 

&gt;**Islam and reformation, two words that cannot go together**. Islam is a religion which has a book that is considered as the literal word of god. How dare you propose a reformation on the word of god? Couldn't god give a word which goes for each and every time interval of humanity, that we need to reform his book? 

&gt;You cannot reform Islam, it's against the logic of Quran and everything. Islam came to be universal and time-independent. Even saying that it needs a *reformation* is a clear step into heresy. In some Muslim countries, you could get killed for what you propose. 

&gt;I am not in for reformation. I am against Islam itself, reformed or not I don't give a ****.

There's just too much to list regarding my face routine, I've even been treated with Roaccutane for 6 months in the past, have tried everything from antibiotics and prescription items to homeopathic treatments, dieticians, £300 facials and expensive high end products and nothing works. I'm trialling Proactive at the moment as I'm really hoping the hype is true. On my lips I use Badger Balm very carefully, avoiding the edges, and am very careful about touching face/getting toothpaste anywhere/changing pillowcases and towels often. I have to say, over the last 10 years the acne is a lot better and it's the annoying body stuff that is annoying! Though, suggestions always welcome. Especially black head avoidance! 

In terms of everything else, I avoid all SLS, horrid chemicals that may or may not be bad etc. I use tea tree oil Dr Brenners to wash with, I exfoliate legs, thighs and arms with an exfoliator, usually from Space NK but for months I tried an facial acne one and that did nothing... I use organic shampoo. I shave with new 3 blade razors and Space NK daily shaving cream, it's really nice and rich though in the past I have used shaving oils or gels and neither were  much better. I even use conditioner first in the bath to make the hair soft. In areas where the hair is a bit more thick, I use an electric razor and then get a closer shave with a razor, the 'wrong' way. I only shave about every fortnight so it's not even very often! After shaving I use aloe vera or Dermol 500 and then I an ingrown hair potion from Boots but have used others too. I also use lots of baby powder (talc free).

They don't. That's why they've bought in [workplace pensions](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/about-workplace-pensions)

&gt;A new law means that every employer must automatically enrol workers into a workplace pension scheme

So if I were to guess, the idea (although not officially publicized) will be to wait for the current lot of pensioners to die off and say that anyone who becomes a pensioner after 2040 and has a workplace pension entitlement of more than £200 a week (or whatever) won't be allowed to collect a state pension.

Not really, no. gay people are still people, saying something like that isn't really any different than saying ""John Smith who lives on my street will be murdered"", which I'm pretty sure the police would see as a threat. You can't advocate the death of another human being and then claim your words weren't malicious.

&gt;Do you really want to limit our ability to discuss how we want the law to be changed?

If we're in a situation where there's legal discussion of whether you should kill groups of people purely for their thoughts, I don't think free speech is relevant any more.

Yes it's malicious, but that doesn't make it so unusual.  Much of political opinion is malicious.  Many people think there should be a law to punish people they don't like.

In any case, banning speech like this doesn't change people's ideas.  Rather it drives it underground.  Sure you can attempt to ban the worst parts of the Bible from being read aloud, but people are still going to read it and believe in it.

&gt;People aren't omniscient, they aren't going to weigh up every possible concept and decide which ones they agree with. 

No, but neither do we just blindly follow our neighbor.  In an open society we all test and evaluate our hypotheses in a kind of marketplace of ideas, pitting them against each-other to see which ones can survive criticism.  In fact - this is exactly what we're doing now!  We are in such a marketplace.

As others have said, ISA transfers don't count as part of your allowance.

For an S&amp;S ISA first you'll need a ""platform"". The platform provides you with an S&amp;S ISA account within which you can buy and sell shares, bonds, funds, and so on. The platform will charge you fees (broadly some are fixed fee, some are percentage-based), and if you hold funds they will also have an ongoing fee (percentage based). 

Here is a comparison of platforms (which also often provide SIPPs and standard taxable trading accounts): http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/

Vanguard is a fund manager - they provide funds (specialising in index funds) and have an excellent reputation for doing this, but there are other good options too. So you might open an S&amp;S ISA account with a platform, and buy Vanguard (or other) funds within that.

Many of us are of the opinion that low-cost index (""passive"") funds are the way to go, rather than more expensive actively managed funds, or holding individual bonds and shares. If you want to know more about this research the ""active vs passive"" debate online.

Share prices are very volatile so most people reduce this volatility by also incorporating bonds in their portfolio - again, there are index funds for bonds. (There are also REIT funds, which is basically a way of investing in property - this is usually closer to shares than bonds in terms of return and volatility.) Having these bonds in your portfolio reduces expected return a little but should give you a much smoother ride. As you get closer to the point you'll need the money, you'll probably want to increase the proportion of your portfolio in bonds to reduce the chance of your investments being down when you sell them. Someone with a high risk tolerance and a long (say, 30 years) horizon might choose 0% to 20% bonds, someone who's risk averse and close to retirement might have 80% bonds. 40% bonds is a typical one-size-fits-many proportion. 

Here's an overview of some low-cost index funds: http://monevator.com/low-cost-index-trackers/

If all that's leaving you with a headache and you want to keep it simple then you could do worse than to pick one of Vanguard's pre-mixed ""LifeStrategy"" funds. These come in 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% (and 100%?) bonds flavours for you to pick depending on your desired risk level, and contain other Vanguard (index) funds in a mix (with a bit of a bias towards UK equities). Note that they're named based on the percentage of equities in each fund, so LifeStrategy 60 has 40% bonds, 60% equities.

(I started with LifeStrategy 60 and have since added other funds to tune my asset allocation - it's a good way to have confidence that you're probably not doing something *massively* stupid when you're just starting.)

Note that even with a decent proportion of bonds you will have volatility and risk - I think Tim Hale (?) suggest you should expect that at some points you may well have falls of half the equity portion of your portfolio (so the value of an 60% equities portfolio will probably fall 30% in a year at some point). If you bail out when your investment falls then you'll likely miss the rebound and suffer from ""buy high sell low"" syndrome - so consider how you'll handle it psychologically.",null,0,null,1427577338,null,0,1427578002,0,cptv7lw,null,t3_30lwyj,null,t1_cptv7lw,null,t3_30lwyj,null,null,null,1432067971,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

You're of course putting me in the invidious position of having to defend the right of people to utter despicable opinions.  And no doubt some moron will leap on this and accuse me of endorsing such opinions.  But anyway -

Your best bet is to maximise both your income outside of term and your final grade. In this respect:

* Avoid debt if possible, but bear in mind that it might not be worth fretting your life away over staying in the black - you still need to study after all.
* Apply to companies early for summer work. (Preferably related to your degree or at least in some industry.)
* If possible, make this a regular thing. (I used to do specific yearly measurements for a chemical plant each summer. The money would cover most of my yearly expenses.)
* Work hard during term time, don't be afraid to ask the lecturers/postgrads for help if you find something difficult.
* Falling behind is the easiest path to failure so learn to structure your week appropriately. (New students generally find this quite difficult.)
* Stick with the 123 account or equivalent for the time being.
* Start thinking about investments once you've got a reliable income, i.e. post-uni.

It's abundantly clear from history that one of three things is true:

1) The majority of Germans in 1933 were comically evil people

2) People aren't flawless thinking machines and you can't rely on their critical thinking to stop them from approving of atrocities. 

3) hitler was telepathic

I'm going with 2.

firstly that's not relevant in the case of what you posted, since leviticus 20:13 says ""[..]shall be put to death"". As in, will be killed. Not will have a judicial review to find whether being put to death is the right thing to do.

secondly and more importantly though, I don't really agree that the difference is meaningful. If someone says they're trying to you hanged it's still pretty stressful and not something you should have to deal with, even if they're not standing on the scaffold at that moment.

This is hands down, THE main problem with the job centre.

Job searching in itself it a skill, and they need to train you up to be able to find work effectively. 

People need to be able to pick and choose what content to put in their CV, and how to format it. Far too many people have poorly formatted CVs with content like ""I enjoy listening to music, going out with friends and taking my dog for a walk"" - No, the job centre should critique your CV or even write one for you to give you the best chance. Currently only third parties do this, and their availability is extremely limited - at my local job centre they were only in one day a week, and you had to book 2+ weeks in advance. 

Potential applicants also need to have some knowledge of how employers advertise - and more importantly they need to know that the majority of businesses don't advertise at all, they just wait for applicants. Currently, jobsearch advisors will carry out a 10 minute job search with you, but that is a complete waste of time because it doesn't help; anybody can type a few search terms into Universal Jobmatch and send an email out. They need to show how to be more pro-active and recommend other methods which can be used to find work and attract employers. They also need to be making contacts with local businesses and forward suitable candidates for interview if any vacancies open up, which ironically is exactly what the job centre used to do.

Anybody looking for work needs to know how to speak to employers both at the point of application (If making the first contact in person or over the phone) and during the interview. Effective communication is an underappreciated skill and a little bit of interview practice and feedback would go a long way. Currently third parties are hired for this sort of thing, but jobseekers are only referred after 6 months and often the private companies only do it half arsed. I attended a course myself (Not through the job centre - industry funded) which gave fantastic interview coaching; they had a recruitment consultant poke holes in my CV and ask very difficult interview questions (The guy in question usually interviewed for exective/director positions and reminded me of Claude from the Apprentice). I held up pretty well and there wasn't much about my interview style that needed changing, but the confidence boost alone probably led to me getting a job later on. The job centre needs a dedicated interview coach in every job centre, and appointments should be offered from day 1 to people who need it.

The fact is that the job centre's resources are stretched. Advisors will spend most of their day dealing filling out paperwork and checking peoples job search history, which leaves them with little to no time to actually help the unemployed. They need to remove these bullshit JSA agreements to free up resources, and then focus their efforts on actually helping people.",null,0,null,1427579186,null,0,1427589974,0,cptw36f,null,t3_30kcdb,null,t1_cptw36f,null,t1_cpti49v,null,null,null,1432068385,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It doesn't matter if he had mental health issues.  This is mass murder.  His mental health status would be irrelevant in a court until sentancing, unless evidence could be provided to the judge that this should be taken into account during the trial, which would be very unusual in serious cases since the law applies to everybody equally.

I suspect that many other mass murderers, be they called ""terrorists"" or ""serial killers"", also suffer from mental health issues, but speculating on it in the media generally doesn't happen, because it is not neccessary since the story is salacious enough and such speculation would be tasteless.  However because this is the ""only"" angle the press have on such a bizarre story, they are running with it without a thought to the possible consiquences on already very vulnerable group of people sufferering from mental health issues.

Monkey boy said on SC: I have some ITK of sorts, probably not even worth noting but thought I'd share.

null,false,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,null,"Parliamentary Bills which are raised in the House of Commons (lower chamber), are automatically passed to the House of Lords for scrutiny. Any amendments made by the House of Lords must be considered by the Commons before the Bill can be passed. If agreement can't be reached, then the Bill moves back to the House of Lords. A Bill may move backwards and forwards between the two Houses before agreement is reached, so this stage is sometimes called “ping pong”. This ping pong is limited to one year, and in certain occasions the House of Commons can invoke the Parliament Act, which in essence vetoes any decision made by the House of Lords and forces through the Bill.

Bills can also be created in the House of Lords, and then the above process works in reverse with the Bill being scrutinised by the House of Commons.. although there is no vetoing act for the Lords.

There are a few constitutional conventions that also limit the power of the House of Lords. None of the Lords are publicly elected, and consist of 92 hereditary peers who are remnants of the old system where 'proper' Lords and Ladies (i.e. huge landowners birthrighted into the position via a peerage), would be appointed, as well as their sons ad-infinitum when they died. 

26 of the House of Lords are the 'Lords Spiritual'; Bishops from the Church of England. The rest (672, yes the House of Lords is **massive**!) of the sitting members are ""Life Peers"", which in theory are experts in various fields (politics, law, medicine, science) who have been promoted to the House for their contribution to society. However in real life we often see the various political parties parachuting in ex-Members of Parliament to try and swing the House of Lords into their favour. It's not good. But it is a lot less partisan than the House of Commons.

So, the Lords has slightly less power, as it cannot force through Bills, and is always seen as subservient to the Commons. It's still a pretty massively integral part (if very flawed) of the political process though.

First thing to do is start reading ingredients lists. Lose ALL harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates), fragrance, drying alcohol, anything alkaline (soap, baking soda).

My main trigger was shampoo *bubbles* running down my arm and my case was fairly mild.

Shaving IS exfoliation and damages the skin barrier, you do not need to exfoliate as well, and certainly never scrub at your skin because this is irritating. Not everyone can close shave - the men in my family sport 'designer' stubble because they are just too sensitive.

If you can find one a broad spectrum sunscreen based on zinc oxide is antibacterial and soothing/ calming.

Also review your diet and lifestyle choices - at this time of year and when using sunscreen oily fish is especially important for the long chain omega-3s and bioavailable vitamin D. Experts advocate up to four servings a week. Also whole eggs, seeds such as pumpkin and chia, walnuts, cocoa.

Dr Bronners is true soap, it is highly alkaline and decimates the skin flora and acid mantle. Little better than SLS (not the only harsh anionic). Do not try to avoid areas because that is impossible, do not use products that have red flag ingredients. 

Organic and natural is not better there are numerous poisons, irritants, allergens and toxins in nature. Read ingredients and the pH not advertising claims.

For exfoliating NO scrubs and NO over wetting/ soaking. At most a lactic acid or urea body lotion (hydrating and exfoliating at the same time). I like Flexitol hand cream, foot balm, heel balm (10%+ urea plus lanolin).

IME my skin was way less dry when I stopped over cleansing, over exfolaiting and hydrated from the inside. **Basically I give my skin what it needs dermatologically, I don't attack or fight it.**

Generally, no. Party lines are a bit more blurred in the Lords as they can't be voted out, so they're under far less pressure to try and ""win"" for their party.

The vague idea is that the Lords act as a ""hmm, are you sure this is a good idea - maybe you should think about this again?"" buffer, to temper policies coming from the Commons that might need more refinement.

Some of that is party-political, most of it is due to the Lords' own perception of what's good/bad for the UK. A recent example was the [proposed EU referendum bill](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25876649).

Like most things in British politics, it kind-of-sort-of works most of the time despite its major flaws.

You wouldn't in a million years sit down and create that kind of system from scratch, so bodies like the Scottish Parliament (which, in UK terms, is dangerously modern in function) are far more in favour of ditching it in favour of the unicameral parliament model that they use.

Within Westminster most parties agree it should be reformed, although nobody can ever quite agree how or when (that may or may not have something to do with the fact that many senior Westminster politicians end up living out their days as Lords).",null,0,null,1427582693,null,0,false,0,cptxs8g,null,t3_30mg7u,null,t1_cptxs8g,null,t1_cptx2wp,null,null,null,1432069184,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,Rabobi,null,null,null,"It is something to consider but I am forced to ask myself would one or two years make that difference when it comes to the least likely group to vote? I don't think so. This isn't a reason to deny them the vote though. I don't believe that most politicians that get into the position to run only care as far as the next election. I don't think Miliband only cares as far as the next election, I know there will be those on this sub that disagree with me but I also don't think Cameron only cares as far as the next election. I view them both as people who care about the UK, they have different methods and attract different demographics but I don't question where their priorities are. One is probably better than the other but I will keep my opinion private as it is irrelevant. But for those who do only look as far as the next election or the immediate gains not considering the long term, there will always be some, will this make them consider the long term? I don't believe that is the case, they may campaign to the youth more but it will not chance who they are, they are still not the type of leader that is needed.

I am also aware of the political aspect of this. There is the simple truth that the youth are more likely to be left wing. I am not sure about this one but I think the elderly are more likely to be right wing but I am unsure. I certainly don't think the voting age should be reduced based on some political idea by the left wing to gain more votes but neither should it be denied because the right wing wishes to prevent those votes. As I see it, the idea of a lower voting age is not harmful, people are ready at different times, some are ready at sixteen, others seventeen, others eighteen and perhaps some even later, some may be ready at fourteen even but there is no test so we have to standardize an age. But if at the end of the day some more people vote for a party they wouldn't have voted for in the following year it is not the end of the world, I don't think they will be scarred for life by the experience nor do I think the country would be demonstrably worse off by it either so if people want to do it I am ok with it, just do it for the right reasons not because you think it will advantage your side.

As far the elderly being denied the vote part. Its not just the elderly with immediate interests which indeed run counter to our long term interests. indeed by supporting such a system you would be doing just this, looking at your immediate interests not considering when you are old and no longer having the vote and have no recourse to get a government that would help you. But the question is would it force politicians take a longer view with their policies, I say no, the reason is the election cycle, to get elected you need to consider the short term effects of your actions, no matter who is voting this doesn't change, your policies can be great long term but unless people feel good about you at the time of the election your long term policies mean nothing.

But this is besides the point, even if it did, I would be against it.

I wouldn't put it past them tbh. My mate had to go and register his details at a police station because of ""rail ticket fraud"" once. He'd bought his tickets online and included the 16--25 railcard discount, then got hammered the night before the journey and lost his wallet (still had his tickets as he didn't take them out). The conductor asks to see his railcard when he looks at the tickets and he explains that he lost it. He's then told he has to pay the difference in ticket price, which he can't do because he lost his bank card. The conductor notes down his details and he finishes the journey. He gets a knock on the door from the police a few days later saying he needs to register at the station because he now has a criminal record. 

This might well be due to the fact that in his hungover stupidity, my mate gave the name and address of his friend to the conductor. The police obviously found out they had the wrong house and were able to trace back my mate's *actual* address from the bank card details from the purchase; my guess this got him into more trouble than he otherwise would have.

The following is an excerpt from Fleming Rose's 'Tyranny of Silence':

&gt;Leading Nazis, such as Joseph Goebbels, Theodor Fritsch, and Julius Streicher were all prosecuted by the Weimar Republic for their anti-Semitic speech. Streicher served two prison sentences. But those court cases served as an effective public-relations machinery for his efforts. The more charges he faced, the greater became the admiration of his supporters. On the occasions on which he was sent to jail, Streicher was accompanied on his way by hundreds of sympathizers in what looked like his triumphal entry into martyrdom. In 1930, he was greeted by thousands of fans outside the prison, among them Hitler himself. The German courts became an important platform for Streicher’s campaign against the Jews.

&gt;Aryeh Neier, who fled the Nazis with his parents in 1939 and later became a well-known human-rights activist in the United States, invoked the wrath of many when in 1977, as leader of the civil rights organization the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he defended the right of a group of Nazi sympathizers to march on the Illinois town of Skokie, home to many East European immigrants who had survived the Holocaust. Years later, Neier reflected that the ACLU’s argument for defending even Nazis’ freedom of speech had come to be widely supported in the United States. He felt that was because after they won the right to demonstrate, the Nazis failed to gain much attention, and the movement died soon afterward. The story serves as one illustration of the fact that the most effective means of combating Nazism was to defend the freedom of speech of the Nazis themselves.

&gt;I could not bring myself to advocate freedom of speech in Skokie if I did not believe that the chances are best for preventing a repetition of the Holocaust in a society where every incursion on freedom is resisted,” Neier wrote in his book Defending My Enemy.13 Neier points to several examples during the Weimar Republic when efforts to restrict the free speech of the Nazis were counterproductive. In 1925, Adolf Hitler was prohibited by Bavarian authorities from speaking in public. The Nazis reacted by producing a poster of Hitler, with his lips sealed with tape on which was written, “Alone among 2 billion people of the world, he is not allowed to speak in Germany.” That propaganda image so enhanced Hitler’s popularity that the authorities felt obliged to lift the ban.
The widely touted claim that hate speech against the Jews was a primary cause of the Holocaust has no empirical support. In fact, one might as well argue that what paved the way for the Holocaust was the ban on hate speech, insofar as it handed Streicher and other Nazis a glorious opportunity to bait the Jewish community in the bully pulpit of the courtroom. For supporters of democratization of the Weimar Republic, a far more effective strategy would have been to address Nazi propaganda in free and open public debate. But in Europe between the wars, confidence in free speech was running low.

Every year you can invest up to £15000, the deadline to invest is April 5th, so if you have 15k I suggest you add it before 05.04.15 and after that date you can add another 15k for the next tax year (05.04.15 - 05.04.16)

There are two types of ISA accounts, one cash ISA which is similar to savings accounts in terms of interest (ie. low interest) and a Stocks and Shares ISA where you can invest into stocks and funds and the gains are generally better but with more risk.

Hargreaves Lansdown is a platform, not an investment. The simply provide accounts via which you can buy investments (shares, bonds, funds). There are many other platforms, and HL may well not be the cheapest for you. Comparison here: http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/

I don't know if anyone is guaranteeing an above inflation return at the moment (something like NS&amp;I index-linked savings certificates would be ideal, but I don't think they're available now). There are index-linked bonds (and funds thereof) which would provide some protection from unexpected inflation, but I don't know if they're actually offering a non-negative yield on top of inflation at the moment.

You should be able to mix equities and bonds to outperform inflation over the long term with a good degree of confidence, but all such investments carry risk and in the shorter term may be more volatile.

AFAIK if you hold things only within an Share *ISA* then you shouldn't need to do a tax return for it (one of the advantages of this).

You can get a reasonable (though taxable) interest rate with some current accounts, subject to limits on how much you can have in them. From memory, 3% (taxable) on 3k to 20k in a Santander 123 current account. This isn't index-linked, so isn't guaranteed to match inflation, but may provide a better return than your savings accounts without the risk and volatility of investment.

For a die-hard Star Trek fan, it might very well be the opposite.  I'm sure for them, watching reruns of ""Star Trek"" is something that is can't miss for them.  

I would just guess that there are probably more Star Trek fans in America than there are Doctor Who fans, thus making it an intelligent business choice for the network.  Networks don't just throw shows on the air haphazardly.  I'm sure they have solid data showing that the lineup of shows that have is the best option at the moment.  

We also have to remember that BBC America is not quite the same thing as the BBC.  They are mostly distinct in their programming, and are completely distinct in their lineups.  

As for it being pandering, you are absolute right.  All networks pander to their audiences, because at the end of the day, the network is a business.  As a business, they need to air what is going to get watched by the most people at that point in time, so that they can get the most advertising revenue.

You aren't the solicitors' client, so they won't be able to speak to you- but once again, it's a good sign for you overall that there are solicitors involved: it indicates that there's someone in the picture who has a very real understanding of the requirements of trusteeship. Even in the the very worst case, it would help you argue that your sister was aware of her duties as a trustee.

At this point, you are best advised seeking legal advice before doing anything else. You can try the citizens' advice bureaux, or a local law centre (many universities have them). 

You should only get the police involved once you have some real indication or evidence that your sister is fraudulently taking money from the trust.

I'd suggest before you look into the tax situation before you get your Newcastle mortgage, to ensure you follow the tax rules for claiming it as an expense on the letting income. Depending on the tax band you are in, this could be saving you tax to the tune of 20-40% of the interest amount.

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"I'd just like to leave my thoughts here. 

While Neymar and Hazard do play in the same position, their roles in the team are a bit different, and their teammates make a difference as well. This is why I think its a bit unfair to compare them on their tracking back ability (like you said which I agree with) but also the number of goals scored.  It is more than reasonable to say Neymar is a better player than Hazard, but having more goals shouldn't be a *massive* reason. Why? He isn't given the freedom down the flanks to keep launching attacks like Neymar does. That's just how Mourinho's system works, everyone puts in a shift and everyone gives equal contribution. He is constantly tracking back and helping dave out at the back, tracking his man and working incredibly hard off the ball. He was criticized by Mou for not doing enough of it last year and now he is. I am 100% confident that if he were to play in a system where he had free reign to just attack, he'd be scoring more/getting more assists. Secondly, in our games, pay attention to how the opposition focuses its defense. The majority is focused on Hazard's flank because Willian offers almost nothing going forward, there is constantly an uneven balance in the defence of the teams we play against, as the large focus is on Hazard's side, two players always on him. Teams that play against Barca don't have that luxury to focus on Neymar, because they worry more about Messi, not to mention the best striker in the world as well. Thus, Hazard's a large chunk of contributions come in the form of his defensive efforts as well as opening up space for his teammates. He's also a huge part of our attack, many of cesc's assists have come through a chance/attack created by Eden. 

I also do think you could make a case for saying Hazard is a better dribbler than Neymar. He has the most takeons and dribbles of anyone across the top 5 leagues in Europe, trailed by none other than Messi. 

You mentioned his build and physique, but it is indeed those things that make him a better dribbler. His explosiveness and ability to leave players for dead do indeed have a large part to do with his physique, and may well be a big part of the reason he's a better dribbler. Now skill wise, yeah Neymar's probably better. 

&gt; And in regards to fouling, so what? What on earth does being fouled more have to do with your skill. If anything it is surely a negative to not getting passed someone. I am baffled that you would use this as any sort of evidence that a player is more skilled than another.

Well in terms of dribbling you could argue that it shows players are forced to foul him as a means to stop him, most of these fouls involve clear trips when he bursts past someone. 

&gt; Probably true, but for Neymars position and role on the pitch this isn't really a factor and should not be held against him. 

Completely agree, he has no reason to track back in the way that barca play, and it indeed shouldn't be a factor to judge him on. 

All in all, I think its really hard to determine which of these players is better, though I do think Hazard is more consistent. Neymar has a lot more ""off games"" for a lack of better terms, where he just simply can't get his games going. So perhaps consistency might be a factor, and on the other hand decision making could be a factor which Neymar could be better at (hazard is often too unselfish and doesn't decide whether to shoot/pass as well as neymar). Both fantastic players, whichever one we decide is better I think would come down to what we value more in a player, because these players are just so close. Personally I think its eden.

I like the HoLs, it has a wide base and generally keep the government in check, slowing down or adding amendments to the benefit to ourselves.  For whatever reason, it does appear those in the HoLs are more likely to vote for the good of the many than the good of the few.


There are really only three options.
Have elected HoL's which means it will become a popularity contest and mean more money being given to candidates who will be expected to return the favour, it means the current salary will rise as being a lord will turn into a career.  And now we have two elected chambers which is absolutely the worse idea.
 
2nd option.  Get rid of HoL and have all power in the commons where MP's make the decisions.  Fuck that.

3rd option, we involve the judiciary.  So instead of following the goverment in determining how sentencing and punishesments are handed out, we now give them the power to be judge jury executioner?

We have been letting a place out since 2011, and it's been fine on the whole. 

We use an agency (EPM) and although it's not been 100% at all times, they've generally been excellent. Although we obviously have to pay a fee, it's worth it just to have someone else take care of flat inspections, repair arrangements, and finding tenants. 

They've done that for us a few times now, and I think the longest it's taken between on market and let is about 5 days. The tenants have all been fine too, and I think that there's always been at least 3 or 4 to choose from (we chose first time, based on what EPM told us, then they've chosen the others)

Downsides were repair and replacement costs for the likes of shower grouting, window panes and the washing machine. However I think those probably go down as bad luck and just part of the deal when you get into letting.

Re tax, that's both a pain and a lot easier than I expected it to be. Keeping good records as you go is a smart move. Someone mentioned not being taxed on the mortgage interest, and this is definitely good - only the capital being paid off is taxable, the rest is an expense. Getting the breakdown of interest and capital has proved slightly tricky, but if you give your lender a bit of notice they should be able to provide it, if they don't as a matter of course.

If the former then I really would recommend getting something within the area of her existing properties then ask if she'll manage it for you while you're off working, etc. In this respect your sister's place sounds ideal.

Offer to pay her a cut of the rent and ask her to show you the ropes.

There are a lot of potential pitfalls with renting property, so having someone who knows what they're doing on hand will be a godsend.

Your mum will probably tell you this, but make sure you declare all your earnings from the property (you'll need to register as self-employed on top of your regular jobs). Then after a couple of years you'll be able to use the rental income as proof of earnings to secure a decent mortgage on a second property. Buy-to-let mortgages typically require a minimum 25% deposit, so you'll need to be doing plenty of saving in addition to the two year's worth of rent you've (hopefully) saved.

With the second house you'll have two lots of rent going into it, plus what you can spare from your job(s).

&gt; 
&gt; But another European country seems to be doing both with relative ease. Data I have extracted from the Eurostat database shows Germany’s exports to Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa are more than four times the value of UK exports to those countries – trade that represents a higher share of Germany’s total exports than the equivalent UK figure. Indeed, the UK even exports less than France to these countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the UK exports more to Ireland than it does to China (twice as much in 2011 and 60% as much in 2013). Overall, about half of UK trade is with EU partners (imports and exports). And while the share has been declining recently, the absolute value of trade with European neighbours continues to rise.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"The vast majority of mental illness is harmless. Even stuff like Schizophrenia, Delusions and Sociopathy. (AKA Hearing Voices, Living in a Fantasy and The Requisite for Serial Killerhood)

Most of these people KNOW they have a problem and live quiet lives on medications trying to fit in. We are talking 90 to 98% of people. A handful require in patient medical care. Either because they cannot take care of themselves or are a danger to others. 

Now the problem is mental health issues have an enormous stigma. No one Let's take a delusion. We think ""ZOMG! THAT GUY LIVES IN A FANTASY WORLD WE CANNOT POSSIBLY HIRE HIM!"" not ""That man's delusion is about lizard people living in his attic, it doesn't really harm his work. Let's support him"". 

See? Often you hear about how the lizard people cost him his job... When in reality it's not space lizards from the planet Omicron Persei VIII but just idiots from the Planet Earth. 

Now put this into perspective. It takes a huge amount of effort, training, sacrifice and sheer bloody mindedness to do a hard career. I work as a doctor so I recognise other fields that do the same. 

It's simple. If you often have to turn to people on a Friday night and say ""I can't do x,y,z with you this week, I have work"" you probably work in a job that requires work above and beyond what people think you do (Me? I have papers to read, teaching to plan and I work Saturdays too. Junior Resident = Work Work Work)

So it's not in my best interest to declare health issues that would stop me working UNLESS my work is guaranteed and safe. Which in the UK it is to some extent. Sure I may not be able to work as a vascular surgeon if I am a diabetic (diabetic neuropathy causes shaky hands) but I can work as a GP and there are retraining opportunities. We take care of ourselves because we have come to realise that if doctors don't take care of other doctors then no one else will.

There are none for the likes of Pilots. Mental Illness and you are out. Grounded. No one wants a ""crazy pilot"". 

The worst excess of Mental Illness occurs in a vacuum of acceptance. Let's look at depression. The suicides of depressives tends to occur in people who are backed up into a corner. Who don't see any other way out. Think the gay kid tormented at school and not accepted at home. In order to find acceptance he would have to cut out his family which is the corner he is stuck in and he chooses the way out of that situation which is to give up the fight and stop fighting. 

In this case it's a man who struggled to get a job as a pilot and a highly competitive one. Who despite the difficulties got a job as a co-pilot. Who probably had a mental illness that would have meant that the past few years were just a gigantic waste of money, effort and sacrifice. 

My suggestion? If a doctor provides a medical certificate stating a patient is fit to work, he cannot be discriminated against by his mental health. We need to make it clear that discrimination by mental health issues is not helping this situation. 

Out of every 10 people, around 7 will have a bout of depression each year. Most of us come out of it and move on. Part of that is knowing our problems can be solved. Part of that is our mental state and a lack of positive reinforcements in our life. And part of that is clinical depression. 

We cannot diagnose the dead. 

But I am also Asian. The cynic in me points out that if this man were a Muslim, or Asian he would instantly be considered a terrorist without the benefit of doubt of a discussion of mental illness.

As for a british comedian using a style which is 'ebullient, bug-eyed, prone to deliberately unwieldy metaphors and language at once childlike and ironically formal, hectically heightened to evade any suspicion of sentimentality or solemn self-regard.' 

That's a description of Brand as much as it is pretty much any other British comedian, as the article continues... 'It is the style of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, of Eddie Izzard, of Richard Ayoade; of the odd child who has learned to unman bullies using funny voices and elaborate language. If you grew up reading Smash Hits, quoting Blackadder at length in the playground and calling people “milady” for no clear reason, it may well be a cornerstone of your own sense of humour; even if you didn’t, you’ll recognise it, and know it to be at once charming and a bit exhausting.' -[source](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/how-to-build-a-girl-by-caitlin-moran-9573909.html)  
  
To pretend all these masses of overly vocal people against Brand are only against him because he's a bit too aggressive with the way he talks about peace and love or his verbal style is a bit to eccentric for the British tastes is frankly bizarre, especially when you look at the reception these same people give Clarkson and how they complain bitterly at the system which doesn't let him punch his staff at will and seemingly adore the endless and convoluted nonsense he spews when trying to talk about cars?!

My bro did similar, but he started at 16 and without any initial capital.

Left school at 16 with crap GCSE results, started working full-time at a place he'd worked the previous two summers; They trained him up as a forklift operator. The company was extremely busy at the time so he basically had unlimited overtime at 1.5x pay. Living at home with no outgoings meant he'd saved a deposit for a house 18 months later while still only 17.

At 17 you can't legally get a mortgage so that was put in our folk's names. He continued to live at home with no outgoings while pouring 90% of his wage (that's a guess, but it was a lot), plus all of the rental income into the property.

He'd paid for the house a few years later.

Wow, you are dumb.

So youre an Hindu or a muslim speaking a nonlatin or nongerman language and they use the word marriage? Where did they learn the word marriage from? Did the awful white people teach them it after raping them?

I think its pretty safe to say that marriage is a religious/associated-with-church ceremony. The word marriage is obviously associated with Church, to deny it is stupid.

My question now is why do they want to get a religious ceremony so much when they know its against the 1st rule of said religious ceremony. My main question is why would these fags target a hard working business chain, and want to literally, physically force somebodies hand to draw something they really dont want to do.

It's not the first case of pilot suicide and it's very unlikely to be the last, but there never seems to be a huge amount that could have been done to prevent them - and all the testimony after the fact that no one had a damn clue what was going on attests to this.

Although my personal opinion is that it's 2015 and the human race is no longer in a position where humans have to be in control of either planes or cars. Even when in full control of our faculties we fuck stuff up on a regular occasion causing death and mayhem. After all, over 90% of car accidents are human error, and most fatal plane crashes have also been human error too. Pilots are generally well trained, but even the best of them don't necessarily respond correctly to the situation... even when the plane has a fault, there's often a correct and safe way to deal with it, but unfortunately with a human at the controls this doesn't always happen either.

Cut:

- state support for religious apartheid education (and all its ridiculous inefficiencies, two teaching training colleges instead of one, two under-subscribed schools in an area where one would make more sense etc)

- teaching not especially useful but compulsory GCSE subjects like relgious education (replace with more IT if budget allows)

- the number of MLAs

- the number of departments

and sorry,

- Irish, Ulster-Scot etc? Yes, its nice to have hobbies, but I don't expect the Government to help pay for my parachuting passion. These economically unuseful indulgences need to be self-financing, not underwritten by taxpayers. It would be cheaper to send the kids at some Irish language schools to Eton than keep their tiny pupil populations with a form of education that the labour market is definitely not asking for. Sorry, but someone has to say it. Not alone on this either: http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/letters/john-odowd-is-wrong-to-give-irish-school-green-light-30871686.html 

Gain further efficiencies by:

- further reductions in the number of  councils (Birmingham Council represents over 1 million. Merge Belfast with Castlereagh, Lisburn, Carrickfergus, Hollywood etc). More efficiency and allows Belfast to bat at a higher level in terms of attracting investment by being able to give more resource to this. We're only creating Lisburn/Castlereagh to create a new rotton borough for the DUP. It stinks.

- consolidation of hospital services in the Belfast area. Its too small a city for 4 average standard hospitals. 1 world class hospital (with all its specialisation opportunities) is more like what happens in places like Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham, Oxford etc

- Use EU peace money for actually useful initiatives instead of glorified pension plans for former paramilitaries via so-called ""community projects""

- Relentless use of new regulatory tools to drive much better improvements in public health (e.g. measures on smoking and obesity - there's loads more that can still be done there) and thereby cut healthcare costs from avoidable chronic diseases

Revenue raise by

- a fat tax on chips, crisps, fizzy drinks and all the other crap we're addicted to (would have to include sausage rolls in there I'm afraid)

- fracking (and cut Government energy costs at same time)

- replacing road tax with user payment model (in car GPS recording technology now makes this fairly straight forward). Would raise more, and do it in a fair way.
