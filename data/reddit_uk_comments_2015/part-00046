He has to make sure that the company are not held responsible for anything that happens to you so he wants to know you are well, not likely to relapse and not likely to cause issues in the work place.  He may or may not doubt your ability to work but he has to do all he can to make sure your return doesn't cause you or the company further issues.  You can view that as being mercenary or you can view it as being compassionate - mostly the former I guess but the HR guy where I work is a good guy, so...

On the one hand you really don't have to tell them that much.  All they really need is that you have been signed off as ""fit for work"" by your Doctor.  Presumably you had a sick note at some point - if that has lapsed then you are fit for work, if it hasn't then you are not and need a ""well Note!""  My doc did write a note to the effect that I was ready to return to work.

On the other hand some opening up/honesty may be helpful.  It was for me but your situation may be very different.  I was open and honest about what had happened to me and my worries about returning to work .  My employer was great and I started back part time with their support. 

I guess it is up to you to gauge how much is best to tell them but I found it helpful to be perfectly open.  Your place of work may not be as kind as mine so do be mindful.

The first cause of this, more cuts by the fuck wits in blue at Westminster and a failure to transition this into DWP who pay the money in, not the council. 

Secondly, to my knowledge of people who work with all things benefits which is paid into an account is done so by the DWP meaning that the extra money which should not have gone into his account causing the backlog was done by them and not the council. I don't see how the council could pay it to him only for a day later to give that money back so I'm sure this is a DWP issue in respect to the money paid in. 

The DWP may have overlooked this as well because guess what? Just like the councils they're are very unstaffed because of cuts from your friendly neighbourhood wankers in blue again. 

The workload to workforce is under massive strain because of the cuts by the conservative government and shit like this will continue to happen as long as they are in government.

It's not a freedom in the USian sense of something guaranteed by a constitution or bill of rights, it's simply the law as it stands. Nor, by the way, am I making some argument based on a dodgy legal theory - it's all there in CJA S139, or if you want something official but easier to read: https://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives (though that advice isn't really complete, as an S139-exempt pocket-knife also needs to be non-locking, which is a matter of precedent rather than clear from the written statute).

&gt; Why just carry a knife around with you?

I find it quite useful, I have practically always (lawfully) carried a pocketknife of some type. I accept that some people don't find it useful - which is fine too. I'm not suggesting that people should necessarily carry a penknife, I'm saying that if they want to carry an S139-exempt penknife, then they can.

&gt; that you really desperately need to keep a blade on you at all time?

Who mentioned desperation? It's easy, lawful and extremely convenient to carry a (S139-exempt) penknife for utility purposes. So if you want to, you can. You don't need to have a desperate need for it.

&gt; These are the questions Mr ""I couldn't give less of a fuck"" Policeman is going to be asking.
&gt;
&gt; I'm fairly certain that having an open blade is enough of an indication to be taken into custody. Start whining about it's size and whoops now you're resisting arrest as well as carrying a weapon.

Well, personally, I've always found police officers to be fine with my use of pocketknives (not that it's come up *that* often). But I've heard reports of officers not understanding the law and confiscating lawful knives, or trying to get people to think it's unlawful. So it's worth knowing the law.

You can be arrested for practically anything nowadays. There used to be a more limited set of ""arrestable offences"" but it's now effectively unlimited - unless you can show malice or discrimination on the part of the officer, which would be difficult and still a matter of complaining after the fact. Having said that, I don't see any problem with using a blade for an appropriate task - if anything it supports your legitimate use of it!

Politely discussing the matter with a police officer (while complying with any instructions, not interupting, etc) is unlikely to constitute ""resisting arrest"", in my view. Getting shouty and claiming ""you can't arrest me"" would be another matter.

&gt; Get placed in a holding cell over night and released the next day without a charge.

I haven't heard of this being a problem with an S139-exempt penknife (which isn't to say it's *never* happened). If you're arrested and taken to a police station then the custody sergeant has to authorise your detainment, and they tend to have proper copies of important legislation (like the CJA) so you should have your chance to make your point that it's a lawful ""EDC"" penknife before it gets that far.

I'm not saying you couldn't ever have a problem (and attitude may be an important factor, as might age and socio-economic status) but I've never had a problem and I've not heard that many reports from people who have. I often encounter people who seem to think that carrying a (S139-exempt) penknife is a direct route to jail (do not pass Go), but I just don't think it's true.",null,0,null,1423078642,null,0,false,0,cob6wcu,null,t3_2uqxbo,null,t1_cob6wcu,null,t1_coaytxv,null,null,null,1424192336,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

I had to make a claim because at the time, my mum was unable to work due to illness so we were skint. As I'm not in uni at the moment, I was also hoping to get a job to help me get a little more experience in the real world before I made the jump to uni. 

The first time I applied, the person I was meant to speak to didn't turn up so they booked me another appointment a week later which was major inconvenience. The Jobcentre is not down the road for me, I have to take a few buses to get there so it was a bit of a pain to turn up, wait and then be told that I've wasted my time.

My coach was disparaging and wanted to know why I was applying and not at uni considering I got (4A*'s, 4A's, 2B's and a C at GCSE level)  and (ABB - psychology, english lit and biology at A Level). I explained that I wasn't ready for uni and wanted to try and volunteer/get a job (they clearly state that they have volunteer positions that you can do and still receive JSA) and she more or less brushed my explanation off and made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. 

Then she took it upon herself to say that it was down to me to find a job and that they wouldn't help me with that. I already understood that and hadn't said anything to indicate otherwise so that was a bit jarring.

Eventually, I had to ask to reschedule our meeting because I had to attend a hospital appointment with my mum (surgery). She wasn't happy with that but relented. I tried to ring her afterwards to let her know that I'd be unable to make our other appointment because of more issues with the hospital - no response. Emailed her. Nothing. I ended up calling the Jobcentre directly and was told that she'd gone on leave (on the day when we were meant to originally meet!) and that they were stopping my JSA because I hadn't attended the mandatory appointments. I had all the pertinent info in my diary/journal thing they give you, and relayed it to the woman. She was quite frank and told me that ""they didn't care"" and that I'd have to apply again on the fast-track thing. 

My mum ended up telling me to call it a day. We managed to get by in the end, thank goodness. I feel sorry for people who're dependent on this archaic and frankly, rather unfriendly system.

I think everyone sane (ie not a tory) can agree that trickledown economics doesn't work. the recent experience with Quantative easing shows this, with the vast majority of the money oured into the economy being concentrated at the top.

what does work is ""bubble up"" economics. more money in the hand of the poor. the poor spend, the rich save. Think of a CI as continual ""helicopter money"" and the idea of it being a stimulus becomes clear.

CI also frees the poor from crap jobs allowing them to try to start their own enterprises, a whole country of entrepreneurs awaits us.

&gt; If a club refuses to release a player or neglects to do so despite
the provisions of this annexe, the FIFA Players’ Status Committee shall
furthermore request the association to which the club belongs to declare
any match(es) in which the player took part to have been lost by the
club concerned. Any points thus gained by the club in question shall
be forfeited. Any match contested according to the cup system shall
be regarded as having been won by the opposing team, irrespective
of the score.

It's a request, I'm not sure how likely it is to be honored by the FA. But it's not a remedy pulled out of their ass. The issue I think isn't the remedy, it's the sanction itself. We were found to have violated this annex.

&gt; A player who has been called up by his association for one of its
representative teams is, unless otherwise agreed by the relevant
association, not entitled to play for the club with which he is registered
during the period for which he has been released or should have been
released pursuant to the provisions of this annexe. This restriction on
playing for the club shall, moreover, be prolonged by five days in the
event that the player, for whatsoever reason, did not wish to or was
unable to comply with the call-up.

I simply do not understand how we violated this section. He was not called up due to injury, right? He had no opportunity to retroactively add his name to the squad list which was due 18 days before the bristol city match. If Senegal had decided they want to call him up anyway, and wait for him to heal with hopes of using him later, then they have a point. But that didn't happen.

So the only claim they have is that our medical was misleading. But there's a separate annex dealing with exactly that!

&gt; A player who due to injury or illness is unable to comply with a
call-up from the association that he is eligible to represent on the basis
of his nationality shall, if the association so requires, agree to undergo
a medical examination by a doctor of that association’s choice. If the
player so wishes, such medical examination shall take place on the
territory of the association at which he is registered.

We fucking offered them a medical! They refused! What the fuck?

I think it comes down to how likely is it that your actions will cause a person to kill themselves?

I am not an expert on this but I assume that there a usual a combinations of factors that cause someone to kill themselves or to have a heart attack. 

If we're going to attribute these deaths directly to the Government then where does it stop? If someone dies after they were fired is that the fault of the employers? If someone dies after a verbal confrontation is that the fault of the other party? If an especially cutting Reddit comment is directed at someone who was in a very vulnerable state causes the unthinkable then what?

null,false,InfiniteTypewriters,null,null,null,"I recently supported a woman like this as part of my job. She had about five or six kids, all to different dads, the latest one from whom she was fleeing domestic violence.  She appeared to have serious learning difficulties but was completely oblivious to them. Her GP gave her sick notes for claiming unemployment benefit which simply stated that she had ""anxiety"". Nice thorough job there doc!

She wasn't a bad person, just desperately unintelligent, deluded and in need of support. She had apparently been sexually abused by her father and his friends as a child, but still maintained contact with both of her parents. I'm sure her experiences as a child gave her a totally warped view of what caring for a child means. 

All of her kids had developmental issues due to her complete inability to care for them. Each time they were taken into care their development came on in leaps and bounds, only to stop again when they were returned to her. Thankfully the kids have now been permanently removed from her care, after a recent incident in which she fled from the police in her car with the kids (baby and toddler included) unrestrained in the back seat. The car chase resulted in a crash but thankfully no one was injured. She was also sterilised after her most recent birth, I'm not sure how it happened but she obviously agreed to it.

I suppose my point is this. There is a woefully inadequate level of mental health care and social services support in the UK. People like this exist everywhere and it's sadly more common that a lot of people realise. If a society is judged on the way it treats it's weakest and most vulnerable members, we are sadly failing quite hard. 

We demonise benefit claimants. Parade the worst of them on TV to give the public the impression that all people on benefits are all lazy cheats. The ones I see suffering the most are those with mental health issues who are told by a ""health care professional"" that they are fit to work and then have their benefits stopped. A lot of these poor souls can barely feed and clean themselves, let alone attend a jobcentre to be patronised and judged by jaded and cynical jobcentre staff. So they end up living with little to no money. If they are lucky they will eventually come up on the radar of one of the few support services that are left to help in this country. If they aren't so lucky, they'll end up homeless, in jail, or dead.

I get you've been a fan since before I was born and all that. That's terrific. And I don't think we're failing either. My point all along has been that, as a fan, I don't understand being satisfied with losing, even if it's expected. Losing to Liverpool at Anfield is, by definition, failure though, regardless if you think that is absurd or juvenile.

In the big picture, we are doing well. Lately, we have had a decline in form. But I think you're getting upset more from your inferences than what I am actually saying. You can choose how to feel about West Ham however you like. And I don't need an immediate fix right now...though it would be nice, of course! But I think it is good and healthy to not be satisfied with losing nor with anything but absolute glory. It is frustrating, but it is how you make continual progress.

- Rise of Flight - a WW1 flight sim. It's slow, meticulously modeled and very good fun. Lots of close-quarters Biggles derring-doo. I'm playing the 'career' mode with a mindset of 'once dead, no reloading saves'. That makes even the long, slow flights back home terrifying.

There's a free version on their website, where you pay extra for more individual planes, or the Steam version where you pay to start off with a few, then buy extra 'packs'. It's very sadly underplayed, considering how much fun those old biplanes are.

- Dota. Competitive 'MOBA' game. You control a hero (one of a team of five) against another team of five. The heroes must change the tide of battle so an army of computer-controlled mindless grunts eventually pushes its way to the enemy base. Horribly addictive, competitive and fun. It rekindled a love of multiplayer RTS I'd not had for almost a decade.

- XCom Enemy Unknown. I've completed this once, got the expansion pack, tried again and died horribly and now, months later, have returned to it. A really fantastic game. You control an organisation tasked with training elite soldiers to fight off an alien invasion of Earth. You manage research, choosing new recruits and building technology, but the real meat of the game is turn-based random encounters in which your team of half-a-dozen future commandos kill a bunch of aliens. The game's secret is that you can customise, name, and improve each soldier, so you get stupidly attached to them and make up little backstories.

Post 2012: 30 years

Pre 2012: 25 years

2005/2006 academic year or earlier: When you turn 65

I'm guessing you haven't taken anything out after 2012, so it's either in 25 years or when you turn 65.

&gt; I feel this is hardly going to pay the loan off at a reasonable rate.

Your loan is growing at lower than inflation (currently at 1.5%) so not paying much just lets the loan shrink in real terms by the power of inflation. I would not focus on paying this off at all, it's extremely lenient and probably the cheapest loan you'll ever get. You can beat it with current accounts at the moment!

Sometimes you have great brand awareness and your logo is popular enough that people can just *tell* it's you. But that's not true of most things.

Very interesting first half. We've definitely been the stronger side, had a few fantastic chances but just been slightly off-target over and over again.

Mignolet has been strong. Looked confident, felt good to see him screaming at the back-line and ordering them about. His confidence makes me feel a lot better about having him there. 

Coutinho has been, as always, amazing. Consistent, creative, just lacking the goal. Along with Sterling who has been impossible to track all game long. Wheater will be having nightmares about Sterling tonight. Stevie has been absolutely silent though....

Howler so far from the referee. Don't know what game he's watching, but he's been fucking ridiculous so far. His job is to protect players and uphold the rules. Hasn't done either at all in the first half. Some ridiculous fouls coming in, with no result.

They're gonna tire and we're gonna score a couple in the second half in my opinion. 2-0 or 3-0 incoming. Also...Phil Neville hasn't been so bad really...

null,false,Erasmus_Microman,null,null,null,"&gt; That was a heck of a long post to not once say what you need a blade in a public place for.

Why does it matter? Do you think really think that a penknife has no uses (in public places)? Or is it more a case of thinking that things should be unlawful by default, unless you can be convinced of their justification.

The answer, of course, is any number of mundane things. Cutting cord when attaching stuff to a roof-rack or backpack. Impromptu picnics. Fixing a bicycle inner-tube when the puncture's near the valve and you need to trim the patch. Eating an apple in slices. Opening the clamshell packaging when buying a quick replacement for a piece of electronics that has died. Cutting tape on taped-up boxes (eg when you have a small box that you want to open and close a few times but not pop open and spill its content over the inside of your bag when it gets squashed - tape it up then slice the tape to open, rinse, repeat). Stripping insulation for impromptu electrical repairs. Peeling uncooperative tape/stickers off backing. That's just the blade, of course - I tend to use other tools in a penknife more than the actual blade.

&gt; Leave your knife at home or at work! I can't be stabbed by your knife when it's in your house. Someone can take your knife from you and stab me with it when you're just wandering around and getting it out for God knows why.

Where the hell do you live? In the New York Bronx? In the 1970s?

Seriously, are you worried about the scenario where someone first mugs me for my penknife, and then uses it to attack you? You must be aware, surely, that there are objects that would make far more fearsome weapons than my penknife in practically every homeware shop, pound shop, DIY shop, garden store, kitchen and shed in the country? Perhaps you've neglected to think of every glass bottle in a supermarket or off-licence? In most cases, every loose brick or handily-sized rock on the ground (look at the stats for blunt trauma to the head).

I'm sorry if the idea that a law-abiding person might be carrying a Swiss Army Knife might make you feel unsafe, but I really don't think you're focussing on the right scenarios.

We live in about the safest time in history when it comes to violent death (or infectious disease, as it happens) in practically every category (crime, war, etc). It's not because small sharp objects are hard to find, it's because violent criminals are relatively rare and they fear getting caught.

The media might lead you to think otherwise, of course (scare stories work - we're drawn to stories on things that might pose a threat) and this is a big problem (see the over-reaction to the terror threat, for example).

&gt; The police can detain you for questioning for up to 24 hours without charging you with anything, longer if it's for terrorism reasons. Who's more likely to be detained for questioning? The knife guy or the non-knife guy?

They can arrest you very easily. The can detain you for 24 hours if the custody sergeant authorises it. I haven't heard of any cases of this happening on the basis of an S139-exempt penknife being considered unlawful to merely possess in public and while this doesn't mean it hasn't happened, it's the sort of thing I take an interest in so I doubt it's at all common. (I have heard of cases of confiscation and later return of an S139-exempt knife (without arrest), and cases of question over ""good reason"" for other types of blade.)

""Who's more likely"" is the wrong question. We don't really know, of course, but if there is an insignificant difference in probability, it probably doesn't matter to most. The question is ""is it likely to be a problem"". In my experience, the experience of others I've read and spoken to, and based on my reading, I think that for most *reasonable* people, it isn't.

Let's put it this way: if it was a few years ago, when the police were occasionally arresting (but not prosecuting) people for possessing a camera, would you so strongly tell people not to carry one?

So if we use this straight-jacket of ""logic"" why would we care about a team we never see live anyway? Why not only follow our local team since that is what our geographic (like our historical) limitations should allow us to understand? 

Football fans don't follow logic. We don't get excited about City/Chelsea cause they got a weak history. A legacy is necessary to build on the ""lie"" we tell ourselves to pay money and time to watch this team.

null,false,Erasmus_Microman,null,null,null,"&gt; Who gives a shit about the safest time in history? 

You're worried about thing X (availability of small sharp things) posing you a risk of Y (stabbing injury). I'm pointing out that the risk of Y is very low and has successfully been much reduced in incidence without a meaningful change in X. If you're really concerned about Y, I'd have thought that might be of interest.

&gt; We've never been struck by a nuclear attack. I still don't think that it's cool that people have nuclear weapons.

That's not a good comparison at all. Nuclear attacks are rare but extremely severe events. The fact that there hasn't been one in a few decades doesn't itself mean that the risk posed is low, because even if the per-year probability is small the severity of the event (or, at the personal level, the probability of such an event affecting you, personally) is so high that you might legitimately still consider the risk to society or yourself to be of concern.

By contrast, assaults (with or without hand-held weapons/objects) are common enough that you can determine their likelihood with a high degree of confidence, and thus also the risk to yourself.

&gt; So that's all stuff that you just do in the street every day?

&gt; It is legal for some people to own guns. I don't think they should be waving one around in the street. 

Now you're resorting to, well, distortive hyperbole (to be charitable) or strawman argument (to be less charitable). I didn't say I did *all* of those things every day, as I'm sure you're capable of reading, but I do *something* often enough. I didn't suggest that anyone should wave around a knife in the street (or that they'd be safe from the law if they did). I don't wave my penknife around in the street. Nor my guns, for that matter.

&gt; Here's the way I look at it okay knife dude?

So the people who have a result of their benefits being stopped who then went on to commit suicide or simply starve to death are less important than a job?

No gun is held to their heads when they make the choice to cut benefits. They know this is not an act without consequences, but they do it anyway. 

If these people refused to carry out immoral orders and lost their jobs because of it, that would  be a moral victory. If enough did it, then the policy would have been stopped before it began.

I have NO sympathy for somebody who knowingly carries out immoral orders. THAT is moronic. Your attempts to deflect where the idiocy lays is just an excuse to cover up the immoral actions of your friends and possibly your own.

There are plenty of people who refused to do so (This thread is about one such person), so push the blame on somebody else if that's what helps you sleep at night, but don't you fucking dare try it with me.

You said that you always have a knife on you in public places. I don't object to people owning knives. I'm sure knives can be useful. Hell, I've got a kitchen drawer full of them. Just keep it off the streets okay big man? Keep it out of your hand yeah?

Did you really consider knife dude to be name calling? Man, I'd hate to call you an actual name. Who knows how quickly you'd come with the stab.

You're slowly responding to less and less of my critiques. Clearly you are unable to justify always carrying a weapon on you. And you say I'm the scared one?

null,false,TooLeft,null,null,null,"&gt;It's not that I do not think the Government have been barbaric in their implementation of welfare reform it's just that I worry about collection of a list of the dead and laying blame directly at them in lieu of a tribunal.

The entire argument you've just made is exactly what they are banking on though.

When they are implementing policies like the ones they did, and people tell them it will lead to deaths, and it does, they can rely on people like you presenting the reasonable excuse that we can't actually directly attribute blame.

And I'm not even having a go at you, what you've said is entirely reasonable and true - how can we directly attribute blame on something like this?

Saying that, although we cannot legally prove it, I am happy to declare the Government morally responsible - not for intentional murder as we cannot prove it, but for intentional lack of care. These are some of the most vulnerable people in society, and the government intentionally introduced policies and a working culture in DWP that made life harder for these people in order to ""encrouage them back to work""... and then some of the people either killed themselves or died from health problems.

If they hadn't been repeatedly told people would die and kill themselves, I would buy that the government were operating with honest intentions. The warnings have been proven correct, but the government ignored them.

TL;DR, it would be impossible to ever prove the government legally responsible. But they are morally responsible IMO.

I think Cuadrado will play coming off the bench, the variables of course are the fitness of the players aforementioned.  Given the run of fixtures we have upcoming (Everton, PSG, Spurs) this team needs to be rounding into top form.  But in terms of going to Villa Park, I expect the Birmingham side to defend with numbers and Cuadrado is certainly a more attacking player than Ramires or Willian.  Wouldn't be shocked to see him subbed on, would be more shocked to see him start.  But one would imagine Jose would like to 'break him in', before our run of fixtures upcoming.

Seriously though, the system isn't working if it's just making the richer richer and the poorer worse off.

It's just simply not a just and enlightened society that bails out wasteful bankers but all but criminalizes being poor/vulnerable.

Bankers shouldn't get to wreck the economy while disabled/unemployed are forced into 'workfare' which is at best morally and practically dubious, and at worst a uncomfortably close approach to slavery/indentured servitude.

I'm not going to say every banker everywhere was hive-mind working to reach this situation, but the greedy and powerful are broadly inclined towards increasing their greed and power, and they will find ways of justifying to themselves if it is (and it is) at other people's expense.

I could care less for the current party political scene, most are either the aforementioned cynical self-servers or just wildly impractical ideologues, and I know communism was tested and failed miserably, but this country, the west and indeed the world needs a cultural shift.
One in which easy targets (the poor and the vulnerable) aren't bullied and targeted and where it's unacceptable for the richest and the political classes which inadvertently serve them (usually they are one and the same) to concentrate obscene wealth (the blood and sweat of everyone else in society) into their coffers. Money they realistically don't need and will never spend.

In the long term this will probably require some drastic evolution of our capacity for empathy, and a decline in human greed and selfishness.

In the short term I think it means making parties like the Tories redundant, lifting the petty and daft legislation and rules designed to punish the poorest and the weakest (economically, social) in society, attempts to close the widening wealth gap, a return of social mobility, improved living wages, and finally building more affordable homes while attempting to weaken the insane excess that our property (and rental) market has taken to.

But I'm a realist, human nature is hard to overcome and I can't see many people willingly weakening their own economic positions for the 'greater good'.

Sorry for the TL;DR.

null,false,Trosso,eng-kent,Kent,null,"&gt; Sure - but agency is due to short-sighted goverment visions of training programs ie. not enough nurses/doctors due to insufficient training posts. Lack of GPs, poor GP working conditions, poor morale.

Yes but this isn't magically the tories fault - this is a long term problem that has stretched all the way back to Blair. This isn't passing the buck to Labour by the way but even if they implemented a policy now to train up more nurses it would still take 10 years before we reap the rewards of it.

Instead we pursue a policy of bringing in huge numbers of foreign staff.

&gt;Yes, the management is poor, but look at privatised industries - their purpose is profit for their shareholders. You want your surgeon to cut corners for the shareholder? Using the cheaper implant?

That's an unfair criticism as you're assuming the state is benevolent. The NHS is always under pressure to perform to certain criteria and hit certain targets which equally puts pressure on doctors and nurses to take shortcuts or cut corners - it's why these hideous scandals happen in the first place.

the main difference is, if the NHS does something stupid the government (especially a Labour government) will pump more money into the NHS black hole until it is fixed (if it ever gets fixed) whereas I feel the tories are at least trying to stop this NHS black hole from existing and get it to adhere to proper budgets.

&gt;You must know the state of the US health system. You want that disaster?

Scaremongering. Privatisation =/= the US healthcare system. France and Belgium run private hospitals and dentists etc and you pay for things and then get it paid back to you by the government. I believe this would really help people stop abusing the NHS for the tiniest thing.

I believe the article you're referring to is rated one of the best in the world, it just happens to have an unusually high level of mortality at the same time.

Increasing the speed limit, not covering some things on the NHS, energy policy causing people to freeze, environmental policy causing health conditions, not banning smoking causing cancer, not banning sugar causing heart disease. All of these issues come with warnings of future (avoidable) deaths. 

I would also say that successive Governments' failure to properly address mental health care is reasonable for a lot more deaths over time than these welfare reforms. 

Also I should be clear that I am not saying that the Government simply *cannot* be held reasonable for these deaths. It's just that above we've been presented with a list of people and information that they died around the time they had issues with the welfare reforms. We never seem to know about any other possible contributory factors.

To be honest I simply don't know. I think it's difficult. However the reasons I have given I am wary of taking such lists at face value. It's a very serious charge to say the Government is reasonable for all of them.

Most of Chelseas games require Oscar or Willian in the no.10 spot. Reason being is that they have a lot of energy in pressing, Oscar tends to make a run wide to a flank, using the space that Hazard draws out on the outside left channel by staying deep and making the fullback/defensive winger get tight to him. Hazard then gets past the defender meaning that Oscar and Hazard can then double up on a CB who is drawn out wide which gives hazard space for his mesmerizing runs. If Hazard starts in a no.10 role, then that movement is negated.

Willian should be dropped, simply because he doesn't have the creative ability of Hazard or even Cuadrado, he's very poor in terms of his final product despite being a good ball carrier with tremendous work rate, while Oscar's inconsistency in his finishing is a problem, he is a better incisive passer, a better crosser of the ball and is more comfortable retaining possession in comparison to Willian. 

I'd be inclined to use Willian and Oscar no.10, Hazard and Cuadrado on the wings and Remy as the backup option on a flank. I'm not a fan of using Fabregas at 10 because it usually means Mikel and Matic play together which makes our midfield slow to the ball and leads to us being dominated. While Ramires isn't a good enough ball player for us to utilise his physical prowess. 

Think Chelsea need another CM, one who is capable of playing at no.6, 8 and 10. Modric would have been perfect.

I also was never *obsessed* with anything. I asked a simple one-line question which you exploded in response to. We've only exchanged so many words over THAT choice of example *because you fucking kept commenting in response about that example*. 

It's pretty clearly not me who's obsessed. I asked ONE question. If you hadn't responded at all or just replied with ""I just think it's one of many examples people are likely to be misled about"" rather than ""woah woah WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO I MEAN? WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING. HOW DARE YOU. I WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED' then this whole fucking thing would have been so much shorter.

If you ever feel aggrieved by a ONE FUCKING SENTENCE QUESTION then maybe you should get off the Internet!

To reiterate: I WAS NOT TRYING TO ""CONVEY"" A POINT. AT ALL. I KEEP SAYING THAT AND YOU KEEP TRYING TO 'FIND' A MEANING. And you think I'm DODGING THE QUESTION. I can't answer the question! There was no point! It was a question...just to get an expansion on a point that was made! I cannot provide an answer to you when there is none!

Let me just summarize this:

1. I'm not obsessed with anything. You're pushing this point. If there was nothing really to say about your choice of example, how the hell have you written so many words about this?

2. I'm not dodging a question or failing to be honest about any sort of agenda. There was no agenda.

Do you know what's probably happened here? You've read a tone into words and become offended by it. You clearly read my harmless question as ""OH! And what the hell is wrong with two-men?"" when if we'd been speaking face to face you would realise it was a neutral question with no hidden meaning at all. Then I would have punched you in the face for being a fucking lunatic. 


Literally just go back and read these comments with the understanding that I was NOT TRYING TO CONVEY A POINT AT ALL. THAT IS NOT WHAT QUESTIONS ARE USED FOR.

Outrageous excuse and clearly trying to weave a sort of ""PC gone mad"" angle into the scandal. Far more likely that they were in cahoots, by choice or by coercion.

EDIT - To make my post clearer.

What I am saying is this. The excuse that incidents were ignored, investigations were never started because of the worry of being branded a racist are laughable. As if the police officers are worried about getting a reputation of being racially discriminate, what a joke.

I'm saying that the real reason they didn't investigate is something else and this ""Oh, we didn't want to offend the sex offenders' heritage"" is simply an attempt to push away blame from the police force, who were either helping in on it or being blackmailed/coerced in some way.

Seems like a very convenient way to ignore real issues, feed into a popular racial sentiment within the UK of ""you can't say anything nowadays, otherwise you'll go to jail"" and most pertinently, its a way for the police force to try and squirm their way out of getting any blame ""oh, we wanted to help but we'd have been branded racists, what could we do?""

Do you see the difference? Obviously it was race-related, that's clear to see. The reasons why they didn't investigate and the fear-mongering attitude perpetuated of ""don't say anything, or else you're a racist"" is very wrong though, its absolute bollocks, someone is covering their arse.

MARINADE: 4 Quails overnight in your fridge in a stainless steel pan or pyrex glass bowl with ample thin slices of lemon, about a two tablespoon of olive oil, salt, pepper, Old Bay, lemon pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of ground mustard.

GAMEDAY: Take the birds out the fridge and pat them all as dry as you can. Lay out wings down in a deep cast iron or baking dish. Let them get room temperature because you don't want cold meat in a hot oven. PREHEAT THAT OVEN to a whopping 500 (260 C) degrees. This will take a while. Maybe ten minutes. While this is going on melt half a stick of butter in a sauce pan with a shitload of minced garlic. Before you put the birds in the oven drizzle the butter and garlic generously over yon birds and salt and pepper them. SAUCE FIRST THEN SPICE.

TAKE EM OUT: Poultry got a rest! Take em out after 12-15 minutes depending on how tuned up your oven is. Move em from the pan to a plate so the meat itself can relax and the juices settle, get some more salt and pepper on them, and then cover them loosely with foil. Wait 10 minutes. Eat them.

As for JobCentre staff, I'm known for being really crap with people, and I could do a better job standing on my head. I also have a BTEC in customer service and another in team leadership which means if they ever put me in charge of a jobcentre, that jobcentre would be a fucking paradise for workers and clients alike. I'd set different targets, ones for helpfulness and agreeable results (rather than sanctions), and I'd make sure that employees meet a threshold level of being professional and ensuring customers are fairly and courteously treated. I would set up a system of appraisals for the staff, in order to track and guide their progress, and I'd get rid of anyone who sanctions a customer without a reasonable excuse, such as a well-documented history of blatant disregard for the rules and shown to have issued clear warnings that the sanction might happen.

The way I see it, a JobCentre is as much a customer service oriented setting as a large supermarket is. Just as there are standards of practice for Waitrose staff, in terms of making sure customers are satisfied, there should be the same for JobCentre staff.

I guess that's what their issue is. According to Giresse, West Ham prevented Sakho from joining their squad essentially by threatening them with legal action if he was injured while playing in the ACN. Since he was already hurt, they didn't take that chance. They would have put him in the final squad if they knew he's have been available for any first round match.

I reckon he was called up, West Ham interfered and they acquiesced at the last moment. That's why it seemed clear cut to me. He had been called up. I also reckon West Ham knew what they were doing, and that they would likely only ever face a minor wrist slap. Incidentally, I don't particularly blame the club seeing how the player was injured while with the Senegalese team in November.

I couldn't find the language on provisional call up vs final call up, and how the rules address each, but it looks as though FIFA hasn't made any distinction given their ruling. The only party, imo, that has any particular grounds for complaint is Bristol City. Thus far, they're getting the short end of the stick. Again, that's my opinion. I think we were the slightest bit naughty putting Diaffra on the bench.

Yet we were all herded in, and told to apply for jobs that had nothing to do with our experiences and abilities. That's the bit that rattles me, the jobcentre is funded by tax money, therefore WE are paying for the service, which is fine! But, the service should support me to find a job either in the industry I am experienced in, looking to move into (if this is a reasonable and achievable goal), OR the overpaid advisor should be trained in some sort of careers background AND have an aptitude for being good working with people from all backgrounds and finding out what we're good at and suggesting realistic and achieveable roles we could be best utilised in, given the work climate at the time. 

Last time I signed on, the twat said 'I found you a job!""
I looked in horror as he got out an advert for 'Primary school teacher'
Erm, i don't have a CRB or any formal training or experience which is pretty damn necessary. Besides the fact I don't really like children and have no interest in teaching young kids!
advisor said - if i don't apply to it, I will get sanctioned. 
So I called the school on my phone, rightr in front on him on speakerphone, as asked them in my best formal voice 'just wanted to confirm you need a Primary PGCE for this position?'
Of course the answer was yes, dur. 
Who are these clueless muppets telling me to work with kids when I'm not qualified, and have no interest in it? and threatening to sanction me if I don't waste my time filling in a school application form safe in the knowledge they will discard it straight away, and I'd be shit at it, putting kid's education in jeopardy? Seriously. 

I signed off the next week I was that pissed off. after very politely explaining to him that you needed a PGCE, he wouldn't take it. How can I, a (then) 22 year old know more about career options and training in a field I have no interest in than someone who is paid around £18 p/h at last count to deal with JOBS?

Religion drives through our society imposing itself on functions that should be free of it. People choose church weddings because they're fancy and traditional, not because of anything to do with God. And don't even get me started on Christmas.

I'm particularly appalled by the way church charities are being used to fill in the gaps appearing in our disintegrating welfare state. For some people they are being forced to use church-based food banks or soup kitchens or starve. And these are starting to be subsidised by taxpayer money. As someone who isn't devoutly religious (like most British people) I don't want my taxes spent on church delivered services.

You want quantifiable, objective results. By the end of it you will have; A, B, C. (no wishy washy shit like 'a deeper understanding of the organisation / business') See if they are willing to fund any kind of qualification or training in order to accredit you with anything / everything. [You want to make it abundantly clear what you want out of it and want to speak with someone on how you will achieve that.] (the worst case scenario is that you've been undercut from being paid a minimum wage of 6.50 an hour, down to 2.73 and you have gained nothing for that. If they won't pay you directly the minimum wage (by going the apprenticeship route) you want opportunities that will set you up further in the future.)

Since its in the areas of business, you want direct foreshadowing / specialist training. You don't want to be sat on a desk answering basic phone calls and doing printing. You want to be learning the specialist roles, because post that apprenticeship that is exactly what will go on your cv. 
Theres other things that you will probably pick up on, such as the work flow and the structure. The place I volunteered at, it was very small and 'family like'. The apprentice didn't do much and the manager only really got her, because he won the bid for funding. Truthfully I don't think they needed her for the job.

The fact that he's put such consistent performances so far, week in week out, is amazing and he's been instrumental for the team this season again. The hope/gamble from Mourinho, I imagine, is to get as many points as possible right now and hope that when he (and other key players) gets injured the title would be already wrapped up. I'm worried about this strategy, especially if we go far in the CL, but tbh José has no other choice. Hazard is essential to the team, we need his creativity, his dragging of defenders, his free-kicks and penalties won by running at defenders, his moments of brilliance etc. I read that Cuadrado can do that too, honestly I'm skeptical, but if he can I want José to use him instead of Hazard as often as possible in order to avoid injury out of fatigue.",null,0,null,1423094769,null,0,false,0,cobgxfc,null,t3_2ut2qg,null,t1_cobgxfc,null,t3_2ut2qg,null,null,null,1424182778,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

There's also Prince Regents pool and gym. It's smaller and not a lot to recommend it.

It's only weights and there's an instructor that directs each of you during your hour long slot. It's like having your own personal trainer every time you go but at a fraction of the cost. If you're crap at motivating yourself to going to the gym, this system works amazingly well.

Haines Phillips Architects appear to have done the design stuff for this application at least.

But AHA.

That image also refers to it as Collins Theatre.

And searching for that finds this: http://www.czwg.com/works/collins-theatre

&gt; A new theatre in London is a rare thing; a new theatre without public funding requires ingenuity and the potential for independent revenue. Located on a small corner site north of Islington Green, the brief was to maximise development potential in the provision of lucrative apartments and restaurant space, whilst providing space enough for a working theatre, its foyers and ancillary spaces. In addition, the proposed auditorium itself was to be the salvaged set from Oscar-winning film Shakespeare in Love.

&gt; The solution was to sink the entire three storey Globe-style theatre underground, and use the roof as a public ‘piazza’, itself covered with a glass canopy for all-weather use by surrounding restaurants. Above this was an amphitheatre of 72 apartments. Architecturally, the post and beam structure of the Shakespearean theatre proved a useful reference for a modern interpretation in glass and concrete, which could nevertheless invoke the more poetic image of a forest glade.

2. Emre Can is incredibly gifted. Totally unselfish but is quick, strong, skilled on the ball, not afraid to make a run forward, has great touch and eye for a pass, can use both feet and has a very good shot that's more consistently accurate/dangerous than Phil's or Hendo's. The scariest part of this is that Can isn't even playing in his natural position. He may well be the heir apparent to Stevie in terms of a tough, talented, versatile CM who can pass, score and defend. Cannot say enough.
3. If Phil is ever able to get more consistent with his finishing, he is an absolute superstar. The magic he had with the scoops over two successive Bolton players almost made me bust a nut. He is so smooth and slick on the ball it's a joy to watch.
4. Sturridge changes this team the moment he steps on the field. Creates space for others, is ruthless in the final third and has an innate feel of where to be.
5. Hendo's work rate is fantastic but he must start adding goals to his game. Some of the open shots he took were abysmal, particularly the one he sliced left to right. I don't care what goals he scores in training - once he gets on the field he takes some horrific shots and doesn't even put some on goal that he must (the crucial header vs. Chelsea immediately comes to mind).

I kind of feel odd leaving Sterling out, but I felt my list would be incomplete if I didn't put Lucas in. Sterling is absolutely a class act, but.. well here's my justification for each

**Gerrard:** Stevie G. The man, the myth, the legend. I think this goes without question, he's just amazing. A true talisman for the club, and it'll feel empty without him with us while he spends some time in the MLS. Few have given more for the club than he has.

**Henderson:** I guess this is where my underdog/recovery act love starts. Henderson was great at Sunderland, but came here and honestly felt like a flop at first. However, how he's improved over the years, going from 13 million pound failure to Stevie's successor for Captain, there's no way I can't include him. His attitude and just how classy his play is are great and his drive is great. Of course he has plenty more to improve on still, but he's only 24 and can only get better.

**Coutinho:** Our little magician. Not an underdog, but a brilliant buy from Inter and he's been the saving grace in so many games for us. He's going to be World Class for sure, if he isn't already, and I can't wait to see it keep happening.

**Sturridge:** Came from Chelsea where he basically flopped, and he's flourished great here. He's not been here overly long, but I can't see him leaving any time soon. Great player, great attitude, and a great guy to have in the club.

**Lucas:** Right, so here's the one that might seem questionable. If we think about it, though, after Gerrard, Lucas is really the big veteran for the club. He's stuck with us through thick and thin, and has finally gotten himself back to an absolutely solid regular with the side. I honestly classify him as a World Class Defensive Midfielder, and I think we're extremely lucky to have such a dedicated and hardworking player as him. He's rarely griped, rarely spoken out, and has been a great servant to this club. I'm delighted to see him back in the squad, and think that he can honestly fit into any formation we play, especially with Stevie playing more advanced now, and him excelling amazingly into the CDM slot.",null,0,null,1423100046,null,0,false,0,cobjyhy,null,t3_2ut2f5,null,t1_cobjyhy,null,t3_2ut2f5,null,null,null,1424179899,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

One of the major problems with rape as a crime is getting a prosecution is hard. If you can create reasonable doubt then it is nigh on impossible to blame someone.  

Say you were raped on a date. You didn't immediately go see a doctor because you were ashamed. By now the evidence has gone. You later went to the police. You didn't have any defensive wounds so all you have is a story. At the time you were drunk. 

Chances are the police cannot do anything. There is no way to create a case. If sufficient people complain then they can use a ""no smoke without fire"" logic to get someone. Which is why when I talk about rape to women I often say that ""it may be extremely hard and invasive  but please come see a police man and a doctor immediately. They can collect evidence and process it correctly and help put people away.""

Without evidence all that would occur is the case would go to trial and promptly get thrown out. There is no point in doing that, it wastes money and only helps rapists.

&gt; H discloses to her Learning Mentor that she has been assaulted by adult male and is having sex with another adult male. Mother told to ensure all children are safe and not allowed out. H is 13.

And this:

&gt; M had a termination at the age of 14 and was pregnant again at 15. She was removed from her parents to protect her and yet was allowed by her foster carer to continue the relationship with the perpetrator, even permitting him to accompany her on holiday. There was nothing on the file to suggest that the young person may continue to be at risk of suffering significant harm. Removing her from her family did not afford her better protection and in fact enabled the perpetrator greater access, 

And this really seems to indicate a core problem with the police:

&gt; Inspectors wondered if some of this inaction was rooted in the attitudes of some South Yorkshire Police officers to the victims. They did not seem to believe the girls or their families or those who reported problems. They did not treat them as victims. “The girls were blamed for a lot of what happened. It’s unbelievable and key to why it wasn’t taken seriously as an issue.” A police officer

&gt; “There was no awareness. The view was that they were little slags.” A key partner

&gt; “They didn’t understand the situation, and thought that the girls were happy, or complicit in it. The sense was that if there had been any offence it had been by the girls, for luring the men in.” A key partner

&gt; There were numerous occasions in which girls were not believed. They were threatened with wasting police time, they were told they had consented to sex and, on occasion, they were arrested at the scene of a crime, rather than the perpetrators.

&gt; Police did not understand the terror which many victims lived in and their consequent fear of testifying and their anxiety over whether police could protect them. Some of the crimes we were made aware of included rape with a broken bottle and girls being ordered to kiss perpetrators’ feet at gun point.

&gt; “[X] was terrified when she was in the hostel. She got a text saying that if she didn’t come out they’d shoot her. We called the police… Kids [staying at this hostel] are always seen as naughty kids and you could sense it as the police were coming in, ‘oh, here we go again’. They said, ‘well why doesn’t she just switch her phone off?’ I said if she switches her phone she’s going to be in massive trouble. There was no understanding of the danger they were in. They were also saying, ‘right then, what’s the number we’ll ring them.’ I said ‘No way, she’ll be killed!’ ” A key partner

The woman who wrote it used to work in the library, and she's a really nice person.

My work is very up and down, sometimes 0 days a week, next week 3 days, next week 6.

Anyway, me and my ex partner signed on a year ago as I was in a very lean patch work wise and as I get paid just a daily rate I was finding it impossible to get by.

Got an appointment, sat down.

First question was where we live as we could get travel expenses, 20p a mile.

Said where it was and the advisor said ""oh that's 6 miles out of town, so 6 plus 6 is 12, times 20p that's errr..""

I finished it by saying ""£2.40, but we actually live 9 miles out of town""

She starts ranting ""no you don't I know where you live, it's 6 miles, I can close this down now you know, don't question me""

I sat there open mouthed, but one of her fellow advisers came over and said ""yes they do live 9 miles away, the gentlemans correct""

No apology or anything, after that was a complete brush off, we was out of there within 5 minutes.

So as we were claiming as a couple and it was my work being affected I was the one who'd sign on

First Friday appointment is for 1pm, I get there at 1250am and sit down.
Then the door opens and a young bloke of around 20 comes running in, sweating and out of breath.

He says to the woman taking the sign on booklets ""so sorry my bus broke down, I've run a mile to get here""

She nods and he sits down near me, straight away the arsehole advisor who'd dealt with us comes over, stands over him, bends down to within 6 inches of his face and says ""you're 5 minutes late, I'm having you sanctioned""

He tries to explain but she holds her hand up to cut him off, I say ""hang on, his bus broke down""

She swings to me and says ""you want me to get security and have the 2 of you thrown out?""

After 3 months of signing on I get a letter giving me an appt with someone upstairs at the JC, just to see what's occuring etc.

It was a Friday in May, 11am.

I get there well in time, and report to the desk and the woman there says ""oh didn't no one tell you? He's ill so your appointment has been set for 2 weeks time""

I was furious as I'd given up a days work to be there and told her so, she immediately called over a superior who said they'd been trying to call me.

I told him on which number, he went to check and came back with a card with a mobile number on which wasn't mine, turns out it was someone with a similar surname 

2 weeks later go to the appointment, bloke is worse than useless and totally patronising, plus he couldn't hardly type on his computer.

He gives me 3 jobs to apply for on the UJM site, which I have to apply for within a week I think it was.

So as soon as I get home I sign on to UJM and try to apply.

First job, no longer available. That was a temp position driving for Argos to help with Xmas deliveries. Remember it was now May

Second job, helping out at a local cats protection charity shop, this required sending in a written CV, but what's this? Position expired April 21st

Third job, driving job in Braintree, but I'd already applied for it a week ago, sigh, ok I'll reapply

I counted over 260 jobs I applied for on the UJM site over a total of a 4 month period before work picked up again and I signed off.

How many replies? 1. Just 1.

And that was a joke as it was a courier job which the person who kept emailing me was changing the goalposts all the time.

£10 an hour plus all fuel paid for, sounded good to me.

First job was driving to Colchester, picking up a low loader, going to Kent to pick up a car, then driving it to Herts and dropping it off.

It never happened, he'd keep putting it off, making excuse after excuse. After 5 months of it he stopped responding.

So now, back to work being slack, currently earning £600 a month, rent set by the council at £81 p/w plus council tax at £87 a month.

Would be better off on the rock and roll but can't face at the moment any more of their vindictiveness and stupidity.

She mentioned for example that even Arriva Wales (whatever becomes of it) could end up being the ones that run the trains themselves, if she thinks they'll do a good job, at the very least, I imagine it will probably be the same employees.

Also great to hear her support for rebuilding the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line though, and how she considered the Welsh network ""incomplete"" (it kinda is). One quote that stood out for me was her saying that ""I would like in an ideal world to get on a train in Swansea, go all the way around west Wales and come back down by the east side.""",null,0,null,1423104018,null,0,1423104265,0,cobm7kv,null,t3_2ut71n,null,t1_cobm7kv,null,t3_2ut71n,null,null,null,1424177772,null,6,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,6,null

null,false,gourmet_oriental,null,null,null,"The ""billions"" for health tourism has only been quoted by one source, Jeremy Hunt with his dodgy report (and then repeated in The Daily Mail). 

Prior to the coalition coming to power, all previous investigations put the health tourism cost at around £10-15 million a year. 

The ""report"" included foreign nationals who actually pay tax in the UK, that ""should"" tell you all you need to know. In fact, the report itself stated that £1.4 billion of the £1.8 billion total was by people WORKING or studying in the UK. It leaves those that might actually be able to be classified as ""health tourists"" drawing (according to the report you are basically quoting) between £70m and £300m.

No survey into the cost ever made prior to Hunt's report ever put the figure anywhere NEAR the billions (and lets be clear here, even if you decided to for some reason to take the reports total of foreign nationals including those that pay tax as being ""health tourists"", it is still ""only"" £1.8 billion and the pensions increase I am talking about is over £103 billion a year (inflation adjusted) versus 1980 levels).

The pension cost has risen from 4% of all government spending in 1980 (£46 billion inflation adjusted) to 13% (£150 billion) in 2015. Meanwhile the overall welfare bill (including pensions) has remained roughly the same adjusting for inflation. If we continue to allow the pensions amount to increase, while keeping the welfare bill roughly the same as we have been doing, there will be NO money for the sick and disabled or any other group that falls into the welfare budget.

Any time a warrant is out for your arrest, if you feel that you are being unfairly persecuted for political or religious reasons, you could seek asylum in another country, and if they looked at your case and agreed that you were probably being persecuted unfairly they could legally grant you asylum. The law allows for that, it is not acting outside of the law.

If your argument is ""The law should be followed to the letter!"" then that's fine. But then you can't then turn around and say ""Well, yeah, but, *fuck* Ecuador's laws and all that embassy and asylum law bullshit, I wanna see Assange hung!"" - then it just starts to sound like you *don't* really care about the letter of the law at all, rather, you have already made your mind up and just want one particular outcome.

Sakho is fine and if Lovren sticks around, he's a reasonable backup LCB.  Throw in Jones and Wisdom potentially for cover and I think we're alright, although again, if anyone is sold (out of Skrtel, Ilori, Sakho or Lovren) then replacements are required.  Not including Coates in the mix as I see little chance of him returning to Liverpool.

If we persist with 3 at the back, then we could maybe use another, but at the same time 3 at the back allows players like Wisdom or even Flanagan to potentially slot in back there.

Broader point though is unless we sell someone (or someones) it doesn't make sense to me to stockpile more CBs, at some point we need to start offloading players rather than just always buying more.

We play with three at the back because it defensively allows LFC to play the ball out (even against a press), get width without sacrificing defensive shape and forces shots that Mingolet is more comfortable with handling (long range or shots that rely on reflexes), it really has nothing to do with the forwards.  In fact the system would be more effective with better forwards.  

Borini, as well as his agent, have said he is not leaving.  They say it every window.  
Aspas will certainly go in the summer probably for a loss.  I'd say around 5 mil euro.  
Alberto I think we need to give a chance.  He is, realistically, our only hope from set pieces as Henderson isn't very good at them and Gerrard will be gone.  
Balotelli will most likely be gone.  I like the kid but he doesn't fit the system.  I'd say around 10 mil euro.
Lambert I think will go too.  He won't play barely at all next season but he should be given a choice where he goes, probably for 3 mil pounds.  
Yesil is he even on Liverpool anymore?

I could see Sturridge, Borini, Origi and Ings being the forwards.  

Add Milner, Cabaye and maybe Song into the midfield.  Subtract Gerrard, Allen.  

Sell Enrique, Coates.  Let GJ walk, Manquillo will probably be recalled.  Give Sterling, Flanno, and Kolo new contracts.  Sign a defensive wingback that can play both sides.  Keep Ibe, Alberto (as mentioned above) and Illori.  

Sell Jones and bring in back up GK.

I think the man has the capability to boss the midfield against any team he comes up against, his long shots and range of passing today were also sublime. There will not be any, if there are any, that can take the place of Gerrard's stature at the club.

2. No doubt at all, and he's only 23! I don't see many goals in him, but notice that he scores very important ones. I think he'll be very much like Inniesta, always providing crucial contributions but not scoring tons of goals. 

3. Midfield along-side Can, still captain. He's done very well in that role so far and he can hold his own against the best. Our captain for years to come. 

4. In the defence until we get a decent center back in the team, even if it means he must play the position until next season. If we get someone like Subotic (highly unlikely) then we can move him up into midfield, but right now he's playing very well there and I do think playing there more will improve his defensive qualities of the game, therefore slotting more easily into more of a box-box DM role in the future.

null,false,paulrpg,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"I can see where you are coming from - so let me explain myself without the complete knee jerk reaction. First as a caveat the work that I do doesn't require ethics oversight as it is mostly energy storage and harvesting.

The first issue I have with the subject is that in recent events people with religious convictions are stating that something is immoral. I wouldn't want this banned because of free speech etc but it brings up the issue that if I bow to this purely from a religious reason - a religion that I don't follow - then surely I must consider all religions as to be fair and impartial. If I did this I couldn't eat the bacon roll I brought to work as my breakfast as Judaism sees eating bacon as immoral. I believe it is wrong to be held accountable to other peoples religious beliefs. Another good example of this is the cluster fuck that is Ireland with the can of worms being opened from a tradition of meddling by the Catholic church.

The second issue is that science can be abused and this is true. Over the 20th century science was used for horrendous things. To bring forward my point let me use an example. Lets say I developed a new technique to stop a child from developing a genetic illness - this is something they are born with unless I treat them. I don't have a problem with this being utilized to help children who are going to be born with it but I would have issue with this being used as a standard - if you don't get this them you aren't worth living.

As a scientist I try to understand and develop techniques to achieve a fairly simple goal. From my own work we have been looking at ways to store heat energy without loss over a long period of time. Ultimately I can't decide exactly how my work can be used. For example I believe the scientist who discovered how to use chlorine gas ended up devastated because his work was being used to kill or maim thousands during WW1. Was it his fault his government decided to employ his research in this way? Bearing in mind that many scientific discoveries are accidents can I be blamed for telling people what I found - even if my intention wasn't to do X?

This is my general argument, it isn't particularly well researched but I would rather give a proper answer to a genuine question than just leave it at a throwaway statement.",null,0,null,1423125061,null,0,false,0,cobuuhk,null,t3_2urxul,null,t1_cobuuhk,null,t1_cobu19z,null,null,null,1424169607,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

4: I think as either a box to box midfielder or as a deeper lying midfielder. His ability to pick the ball up and press on is impressive though, I think he and Hendo can create a ton of chances and havoc as two bullying box to box mids. 
5: Brad Jones, see ya. And as much as I hate to say it, I think Lambert, Borini, Enrique and Balo should all be looked into being shopped this summer. Just don't quite cut it for me.

BT, Virigin, EE, (Maybe Three and O2? But since they are merging meh)

This is based on the lines. BT Has its own lines with other ISP's lease and Virgin does its own networks. EE Provides mobile broadband for HOME.

So now its BT, Virgin, (Everyone who leases BT Lines which technically is still BT), And any mobile carrier on their own cell network providing mobile home broadband which I can fully say isn't many.. And if they are doing it the prices are very high.

So currently. Who do you go for if you want fast mobile broadband.

BT. 

So who do you go to for Fast Home Internet.

BT.

Virgin Isn't in all areas. And even if they were again this means that Virgin soon enough will control pretty much every house when it comes to internet. You can either take virgins 152MBit package or you can fuck off back to BT.


This is the point where the government steps in. Starts saying these mergers can't happen and for these companies to start getting there act together in providing better internet service for the entire UK. Including those which are Rural

I am slightly pissed off at this. Reddit is constantly going on about how mergers are a bad idea and how companies coming together can only mean trouble. Yet no one is caring about the Three and O2 Merger and no one is caring about the BT and EE Merger. Quite frankly I don't want the biggest mobile and the biggest landline communication companies doing anything short of competiting with each other and that is it.

Trust me. In a year maybe even 5 years. This will all backfire if this passes and everyone merges. I believe it took AT&amp;T, Comcast and verizion around 20 years to start merging with every single company out there to get the result they wanted.

This was a pretty decent image explaining how long it takes but the end result.

If we are talking potential replacements in terms of signings, I'd like to see FSG cough up the dough for the likes of Pjanic, Isco and I'll throw Pogba in there because everybody in the world wants him (as unlikely as any of those may be). It can't be denied that Gerrard is Liverpool, but as far as what he brings to the pitch those 3 come to mind in varying degrees. As far as in the team, Henderson is the only real answer in my opinion.

2. The only real competition for that spot has been Sterling and I honestly believe we'll see a steady fluctuation of who operates where. 

3. Ultimately nothing different than what he's been doing, he presses intelligently, he distributes almost as well as Gerrard does, he has no problems getting forward, he's dynamic. I think Pjanic would complement him as a signing, or Can would be the first choice as far as in-team selection goes because he's strikingly similar to Henderson and Gerrard, is showing signs of strong distribution and also enjoys getting forward.

This means that you'll be able to a much cheaper service from say a french telecoms operator (they've had price wars there for years) and use it as normal in the UK.

This means there is going to be a whole lot of movement in the telecoms sector in the next few years and all the big players are positioning themselves now to be able to cope. Expect a lot more deals springing up like this and also a lot of 'soft' operators (i've forgotten the correct term) like giffgaff etc springing up selling phone services in english but providing services from a different cheaper country.

This is a massive change from the status quo and is going to lead to hugely more competition.

This might be stupid jingoism but I am glad EE is moving to at least nominally UK based ownership. If only to stop the stupid vodafone advertising about being the only UK owned mobile company.

The OP didn't act like he is the next messi, OP just stated it was a bargain. 

Even out of position at CB he is making himself crucial to the team. Also OP didn't 'shit on' Lovren. He just stated a fact that he has displaced Lovren from the starting line up from despite high expectations and a high fee in the summer for Lovren.

You say that everyone has been shitting on Can, Markovic and Lallana all season but I haven't seen that. You can't think of the whole subreddit as one person. We all have varying opinions. I don't think many people having been having a go at Can or Lallana either. People didn't have huge expectations for Can and he has excelled. Lallana is finding form and fans knew they had to be patient with him returning from injury.

I agree that Lovren perhaps could have been made to look worse because of decisions that Rodgers made earlier in the season but that doesn't really take anything away from Can. I really am hoping Lovren can come good for us as that would give Can a chance to go further up the pitch which I think we need desperately.

The rest of your post is a tangent about how we all think Lovren and Balo are failures. I think they have done poorly so far but by no means do I want to get rid and I know there are plenty of like minded fans out there.

Anyway I just felt I had to post as I think you have made a lot of presumptions in your post, I hope you don't take it the wrong way I just mean to create meaningful discussion.

As far as broadband goes, we've got a very competitive market IMO.

First: Ignore any reference to an EU warranty/directive. It would take a while to explain why, but it is irrelevant/a myth/already in UK law. 

Second: A manufacturers warranty is nothing to do with consumer protection law. It is entirely different. Below is about UK consumer laws that are always in addition to a manufacturers warranty. 

Under the Sale of Goods Act all products sold in the UK must be of ""satisfactory quality"" and ""fit for purpose"". Those terms are implied into every consumer contract and cannot be excluded. Therefore, if an item is not of satisfactory quality or for for purpose the seller (the seller NOT the manufacturer) has breached their contract with you. Under UK contract law you have six years to bring a claim for breach of contract (the limitation period). However, if the device is not of satisfactorily quality then it wasn't when it was sold - this is the tricky bit so here is an example:
You buy a new TV. The TV works when you get home,. But then after a month of use, a wire breaks. Turns out after it getting hot then cold over and over for a month it snapped. Clearly that wire is defective and not of satisfactory quality. But here's the thing - it was always defective from the moment you purchased the TV. It breaking is the manifestation of that defect. Therefore the breach of contract occurred 1 second after purchase - and the six year limitation period started then.
Now let's say the TV broke after two years. Was it of satisfactory quality? TVs do usually last a while, so arguable not. You are within the six year time frame so can still make a claim!
But what if it lasts five years eleven months... well unless it was a special TV that isn't unreasonable. So maybe it was of satisfactory quality and you don't have a claim, despite being within the six year timeframe.
The six year myth becomes more obviously wrong when you remember it applies to everything - not just big ticket items. Does anyone really think they could complain if their ballpoint BIC pen didn't last six years? No, of course not. So long as the product lasts a reasonable length of time, reflecting its nature and price, that is a strong indication it was of satisfactory quality.
Therefore, there is no rule that says Apple has to repair a device a day short of six years.
People get hung up on the point about the defect being there at purchase, but that isn't a big point of you remember to separate the defect itself from the manifestation of it.

**TLDR: The ""six year rule"" is about the length of time you have from purchase to complain about faulty goods to the seller (NOT the manufacturer) rather than about the length of time goods have to last. Goods must last a reasonable length of time, and that depends on what they are, and the price etc.**",null,0,null,1423127180,null,0,1423127572,0,cobvbg7,null,t3_2uroin,null,t1_cobvbg7,null,t3_2uroin,null,null,null,1424169163,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

null,false,q_pop,null,null,null,"There is a flow-chart approach in our FAQ section about [what to do with money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment).

In general terms your first priority should be to pay off expensive debt (credit cards are the  typical culprit). If you are saving and receiving 1.5% PA on this but at the same time paying interest of 20% PA on a credit card debt you're losing out each month unnecessarily.

Once your expensive debts are repaid most people agree that an emergency fund is a sensible thing to put together. Anywhere between 3 and 12 months of expenditure. Most personal finance blogs talk about needing one for things like medical expenses, but that's because they live in the third world (USA) where healthcare isn't free at the point of receiving it.

It's still important to have an emergency fund though - not a ""I need a new gadget/pair of shoes"" emergency but a ""my roof fell in"" or ""my car packed up"" emergency.

The best place to save an emergency fund is something that has instant access. This could be a current account (for example, Nationwide, Lloyds and Santander all have current accounts that pay high levels of interest on small amounts of money), a savings account or a Cash ISA.

An ISA is just a ""wrapper"" for something else. In the context of a Cash ISA it's just wrapping up a savings account. Everything put within the wrapper is shielded from the tax-man (you pay income tax on savings *interest* usually).

There is an annual *contribution limit* to ISAs - £15,000 currently. This means that the most you can put into it in a given year is £15,000, and this is reset every April 6th. Interest within the plan does not count, and if you put £10,000 in and took it out again, you could only put a further £5,000 in that year.

In the short-term, the best account is the one that pays the most *after-tax* interest - that is, if your current account paid 3% before tax, and you paid 20% basic-rate income tax, it would pay 3% * 80% = 2.4% after tax.

The best Cash ISA rate is 1.5%, tax-free, so on the fact of it a current account is a better savings vehicle. 

The caveat to this is that once money is within the ISA wrapper, it is tax-free forever, and so there are long-term advantages to saving in an ISA.

As I mentioned above, an ISA is just a wrapper, so you will hear people talking about Stocks &amp; Shares ISAs on here - this is utilising the ISA wrapper around a stocks &amp; shares account, and so all the growth and income on the underlying assets is free of tax. In the current low-interest environment many people prefer using their ISA allowance for Stocks &amp; Shares.

As you're paying off debt and building your emergency fund, I would strongly encourage you to pick up a couple of the [""recommended reading""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/recommendedreading) books. You will learn everything from the very basics of personal financial management to setting up your own long-term investment strategy.

Prism: concerns over government tyranny are legitimate | Guardian
How to get round the political backlash of spying on your own citizens.
Spy on someone else's and swap info.

The “Five Eyes” alliance between the intelligence agencies of the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK effectively permits those governments to circumvent the prohibition against gathering data on their own citizens by sharing information across the Five Eyes intelligence community. The UK for example can spy on Americans and make that information available to the US government on its massive spy cloud – one that the NSA operates and the Five Eyes share. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/13/prism-utah-data-center-surveillance?CMP=twt_gu

If you are interested in reading more I have other articles on a wide range of political and economic topics and a couple that use the picture and evidence laid out in these articles to produce some summaries that show what is actually happening and what is going to happen in the world. It is nothing like the picture presented by the BBC, because the BBC is covering up the truth in all significant respects.

If you are interested in particular subjects, say the lies about the Iraq invasion of 2003 or bank criminality or the counter productive nature of drone warfare for example, I can post articles on those.

That the chaotic nature of the world being Fry's main gripe with the notion of God. His argument has absolutely no bearing in what religions do, or what they've done wrong or gotten right. Just that such an imperfect world has been created that no matter the absolute wealth of human kindness or charity, children still die needlessly. Unpreventable by the hand of men, no matter how ""fallen"" it is.

It's a simple argument and a stern criticism, but what follows is not only an apology for being unable to answer it but a completely needless defending of religion of a whole which was never brought into question.

Then toward the end he writes (and probably quite proud of his amusing observation no less) that if Fry doesn't believe in God then why even mention it at all? Why bring it up? Completely ignoring that this was a completely hypothetical question asked of him during the interview. 

Then there was the part about how not being happy with human suffering is a job best left to those who believe that we are a Holy creation, which I would say would leave a sour taste in my mouth if it wasn't such a clichéd line often used to say that if there's no universal justice then why do anything good at all?

Yes, it's a lot colder than the Sunshine State but it's relatively warm compared to the Northern U.S. Leave your shorts at home though. Even in the summer I think it barely cracks the 60's. 

Edinburgh, to me, feels like your average college town. You can walk almost everywhere and you're never more than 100 yards from a bar or club. The population seems to skew on the younger side so you shouldn't have a problem finding friends your age. Townies say the music scene is shit but I think it depends on what you're after. Bigger acts seem to skip here in favor of Glasgow but it seems like a lot of places have live music at least a couple nights a week. 

Honestly though, I would reconsider. You're not going to be able to legally work while you're here on a tourist visa and the exchange rate is going to kill you. Consider this, when I take £100 out of the ATM I'm withdrawing ~$160 from my account. PM me if you have any other questions and I'll try and help.

Yes, if you follow the new CPS guidance on rape. But it doesn't matter if it was illegal or not in the UK, because the alleged offences took place in Sweden and they filed a EAW. Just because someone runs away from the law shouldn't mean we call it a wash.

&gt;Might we be looking at the question the wrong way round then? Should we ask why other great thinkers, given that they have stumbled on the same problem, have not felt the need to dismiss God? Why have they nevertheless stood by the Christian claim?

&gt;In part it is because simply removing God from the equation does nothing whatsoever to eradicate the problem of suffering in this world. What we cut off when we dismiss God is not the problem of evil so much as our means of salvation from it. And this is a point writ large in history.

Well yes. Suffering is born from both human action (or inaction) and simply the nature of the universe. Removing God does nothing in the same way that adding God does nothing.

&gt;Both the French and Russian Revolutions, for example, encouraged violent rejection of Christ in the firm belief this would usher in a new Age of Enlightened Reason. It did not. It ushered in a reign of brutal terror, a destructive vortex of madness and death. In Nazi Germany, it was believed the substitution of Christianity with neo-paganism would give rise to a master race. It did not. It led to the unspeakable horrors of Auschwitz. And in Communist Russia, once Christianity was eradicated, along came the gulag and more indescribable human suffering.

This is because of the nature of people looking to seize power. It's got nothing to do with religion at all. Just as long (if not longer) is the list of religious atrocities.

&gt;I hope you don’t mind me sharing with you then that I find the banal destruction, wherever man has abandoned God (yes within the Church as well as without!) to be every bit as infuriating as the cases you note of worms digesting eyes. And I cannot help but note also, that while there have been many sinners who discredit the Church, those who have lived by its teaching, the Saints, are unparalleled examples of living virtue in history. Proof, I would argue, of what faith can do to save us from ourselves. It seems to perfect the virtue that is open to us all.

Saints who are not legendary figures in history have their parallels in non believers. Faith isn't necessary to show compassion and virtue. 

&gt;So let me, in the interests of fairness, briefly underline the huge contribution to life we discover wherever Christian faith has been allowed to flourish. You are known as an advocate of inclusion, toleration, respect and freedom. Are these not values stemming from a Judeo-Christian tradition? It was Catholic culture that gifted England its hospitals, historic schools and Cambridge and Oxford University. It was Christian culture that gave us everything from the architecture of our great Cathedrals to the paintings of Caravaggio.

There is no denying the history of culture, but that's not say such things are impossible or even unlikely without belief in God. 

&gt;But this artistic flourishing has rather dwindled as the Christian heritage has weakened. I don’t know about you, but I am of the opinion that Tracey Emin’s unmade bed, a fruit of modernist culture, cannot hold a candle to the works of Michelangelo, fruits of Christian culture. And today the world over it is the Church that continues to feed, clothe and care for more people each day than any other institution or organisation. Despite its many well publicised faults.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it has far more to do with the place and time and history than Christianity per se. This is a very romantic view of the culture. Pointing out only the great works produced and ignoring the poverty of the common people at the time, the brutal power of the church.

&gt;Noting these gifts is not a flippant point. For if we remove our Judeo-Christian values and beliefs from modern society, the values that inspired the creation of the West, then what do you propose we put in their place? A serious question as we try to navigate through a modern landscape that seems economically, spiritually and morally bankrupt. When you burst the Christian bubble what else do you offer the many people who look to you in modern life? I ask by way of warning. For it strikes me that modern liberal secular values are only found where they parasitically feed of a dying Christian culture. The values they espouse having been taken from the very Christian culture they seek to destroy. It is a path to nihilism.

Well perhaps we remove the un-needed trappings, such as belief in a deity. It does not take a brilliant philosopher to see that tolerance, respect and empathy are or intrinsic value to society. The values are not inextricably linked to the beliefs. 

&gt;But despite these faults it is also a place in which people are loved and held to be sacred. And despite the hideous blots on our copy book, which our sins represent, the fact remains that human civilisation has soared under the influence of Christianity. Why then dismiss it all simply because of the existence of natural evil? Would we throw away a beautiful novel, one imbued with truth, simply because one section proved hard for us to understand?

We can have community without religion, there is no need to dismiss it all, just the bits that are nonsense.

&gt;And if natural evil is a thorn in the Christian’s side, so moral evil is a thorn in the atheist’s side! For if there is no God and we are, as Darwin and Nietzsche suggest, cells with no purpose beyond procreation and existence, then why complain as you did? What possible meaning does life have? Why not cull in concentration camp or gulag? Why not kill those who contribute little but use up resources? Why not let the worm eat the eye? If we stop upholding the sanctity of life, a clearly theistic notion, then what possible reason do we have to be angry? It is simply what it is.

The importance of life is far from a purely theistic notion. In fact one could say it's part of basic biological drives. The idea that meaning must be some external force is folly. Meaning comes from within, even when people think it is external.

&gt;Perhaps then it is not that you disbelieve in God, so much as feel anger towards him and what you think he has revealed? If so I urge you to look again and see not only our grot but also our glory. For there must clearly be something of value in a Catholic Church that has lasted two thousand years, which comprises 1.4 billion members and which has outlived every regime that ever sought to destroy it.

This old chestnut. You're just angry at God. No. once can embrace aspect of Christian culture without belief, they can also point out the flaws in such belief without holding it.

 You say we both draw arbitrary lines. But they're not arbitrary. They have reasons behind them (unless you picked yours at random) and if they're shitty reasons, then it's a shitty place to draw the line. For most meat eaters including me for most of my life, the reasoning is ""I like the taste, I've always done it, and no one can stop me"". This is a shitty reason (you may have a better reason though), taste is a trivial reason for cruelty. On the otherhand if someone said ""I'm in poverty and therefore cannot afford to be too picky about what I eat right now"", that would be a much better reason. So while the ""correct"" line might not always be clear, or the line may be subjective (depending on your belief), there are still good and bad justifications for that line.

**Price of product:** £3.39 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots!

**Product claims:** ""NIVEA Creme’s unique preservative free formulation has remained under lock and key since its birth in 1911. It provides the skin with all it needs to stay pure, making it the all time beauty classic!

And it has just beaten a £105 luxury cream in a 4-week test carried out by Claire Cisotti for the Daily Mail. It has been dermatologically proven to be more hydrating for your skin and reduced lines more visibly than the more expensive cream.""

**About you:** Oily, dehydrated, acne-prone skin. Mostly non-sensitive.

**Your opinion:** This is an extremely thick, greasy cream. For this reason, I only use it at night - I could never use it in the daytime without looking ridiculous. However, I love it and will be using it before bed probably until the end of time. You get a massive tub for a small cost, and this works brilliantly over a serum or lighter moisturiser to keep moisture locked in, or even just on its own. My skin looks plump, moisturised and healthy in the morning after using this. 

The biggest drawback is how thick it is - it can be difficult to apply, though I've found that warming it in my hands and sort of rubbing it between my fingers before applying helps. Plus it wipes off on pillows, so I always put a towel over my pillow on nights that I use this. 

**Ingredients:** Aqua, Paraffinum Liquidum, Cera Microcristallina, Glycerin, Lanolin Alcohol (Eucerit®), Paraffin, Panthenol, Decyl Oleate, Octyldodecanol, Aluminum Stearates, Citric Acid, Magnesium Sulfate, Magnesium Stearate, Parfum, Limonene, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate, Cinnamyl Alcohol",null,0,null,1423133141,null,0,false,0,cobwiir,null,t3_2ohd33,null,t1_cobwiir,null,t1_cmn46sj,null,null,null,1424168032,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

If you get too close to me I'll think you're trying to pick my pocket or something and I'll be sure to let you know, even if just through body language, that you're too close for comfort. That one would probably just make me look a bit nuts as I'll likely look at people too much as they get within my normal bubble. 

I've got a background in engineering and I'm not dumb when it comes to *maths*, the metric system luckily isn't a foreign concept to me. 

And as for the headbutts. Really?? Is it common, like say I'm at a pub having a good time with some people, could I expect a friendly headbutt? Or do you mean if I'm in a confrontational situation to be wary of this?

&gt;if I bow to this purely from a religious reason - a religion that I don't follow - then surely I must consider all religions as to be fair and impartial

No, this does not follow. If you hear an ethical argument and you agree with the reason for it, why would that mean you have to agree with *all* ethical arguments? I'm afraid I don't see what you're saying here.

&gt;I believe it is wrong to be held accountable to other peoples religious beliefs.

That's now what is happening here. Perhaps we understand being 'held accountable' differently.

I'd urge you read [the statement](https://www.churchofengland.org/media/2162903/hfea%20mitochondrial%20replacement%20consultation.pdf) [PDF!] put out by the Church of England. You'll note that it doesn't mention God, the Bible or Jesus once. That's not how it works.

What you find is an excellent, sensitive, well-reasoned document. That doesn't mean everyone is going to agree with everything in it, but it is hard to characterise it as interfering, imposing religious belief etc etc. I cannot see that it is any way inappropriate for the Church to draw attention to certain points in relation to the questions at hand.

Regarding your own work, of course you don't know how your discoveries could be subverted. No one's suggesting you shouldn't push forward because of that. But when something does have ethical implications it's right that we should be able to discuss them openly. And no one should restrict the ethical systems used to contribute to such debates.

&gt;__Islandmagee__ (from [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Oileán MhicAodha*, meaning ""MacAodha's island"") is a [peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula) and [civil parish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_Ireland) on the east coast of [County Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), located between the towns of [Larne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne) and [Carrickfergus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus). It is part of the [Larne Borough Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne_Borough_Council) area and is a sparsely populated rural community with a long history since the [mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic) period.

&gt;As part of an agricultural [crop rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation) programme of old beans were grown to supply nitrogen to the soil. ""Bean Eaters"" became a nickname for the people of Islandmagee.

&gt;It is the site of Northern Ireland's main power station [Ballylumford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballylumford_power_station) and is the terminating point of the [Scotland-Northern Ireland gas pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland-Northern_Ireland_pipeline).

Look like it or not I am as British as you. If we are going to arbitrarily draw the line at ""Only Anglo Saxons"" then we are going down a road of stupidity. This entire mess came about due to ignorance and the inability of the Rotherham police to simply ASK about the issue and find some local Asian who was willing to stop the abuse and work to stop it. Instead they just went ""ASIANS!"" and threw up their hands. For fuck sake. If we can accept that the imbecilles who get drunk on the weekend and fight are human beings then we can accept that people with Melanin are human beings too. 

We don't speak of the EDL as a white problem, we speak of it as a problem with racists and ignorant people. We speak of this gang as precisely that. A gang of criminals. Their race has little to do with the issue.  

Guess what? This is no different  from Jimmy Saville's systemic abuse of children in places as open as hospitals. This is an issue of

1. A systemic failure of a police force to deal with rape properly

2. An unwilling group of people who didn't wish to deal with a gang of criminals

3. The failure of the state to properly intervene. 

Remember. Not one person even bothered contacting the Asian community about the problem. Want to know something? Historically speaking crimes like this have been fought by liason work rather than going ""FUCK IT ASIANS"". 

By delaying acting with the Asians the problem became polarised by douchebags and wastes of space from the BNP and UKIP and EDL. Now you couldn't accuse anyone without enabling revenge attacks from the BNP and EDL. Note the EDL were the group of people who fought Muslims by smashing up the stores of people called Patel (A Hindu Name BTW. Never mind the illogical stance on fighting Islamic extremism by harming moderate Muslims. That's like stopping the EDL by kicking over the little old lady who works in Barnados)

There were minority victims too, they got even less support often because the attackers utilised cultural norms to hide their abuse. In short? These guys were dickheads. Their race never came into it. The only people who made it a racial issue were the incompetent police and the racists. You can deal with this without the Sieg Heil Brigade.

null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"Perhaps I should have made my point clearer. My hinting at it in the first line was perhaps not explicit enough.

The argument most commonly made against Balotelli is that he's lazy and not intelligent enough to function effectively in Liverpool's system. Our main complain about Bent is that he's lazy and not intelligent enough to function effectively in **our** system. If you look at them, though... Bent does well when he can loiter in the final third waiting for service, Balotelli does well when he's allowed to drop deep to receive the ball and link the midfield to the attack.

Now do you see why I asked?

Ignore ages and current form, that muddles the discussion (because now we are no longer looking at Darren Bent, the England striker averaging a goal every couple of games; though I don't think that's necessarily a fair appraisal of his actual ability). Ignore fees and salary too. Just assume we can handle the financial aspects, and both players would agree to the deal (hence: ""hypothetical""). I'm thinking more along the lines of tactics. Who fits better, and so on. 

If you think that's oversimplifying it... look back to when we signed Bent. Would you have preferred we spent that money on Balotelli at the time?

Or how about if, for argument's sake, Bent had been out on loan this season to Swansea and was banging in goals (as we know he can) because he had better service there. We couldn't recall him from his loan, but now he's back because it's January (again, roll with it)... Do we still want to swap him for Balotelli?

What if Darren Bent was still 24, too? Would we still swap?

Essentially, I guess I'm asking ""Would Balotelli have been a better fit here than Bent?"" and/or ""Would Bent be a better fit for Liverpool than Balotelli?""",null,0,null,1423135247,null,0,false,0,cobwxck,null,t3_2uurzb,null,t1_cobwxck,null,t1_cobvvdr,null,null,null,1424167644,null,0,false,avfc,t5_2s569,0,null

By far the most common kind of abuse is verbal abuse directed at random members of the public, disproportionately by people of Asian or Arab extraction. This includes 233 incidences of verbal abuse which took place over social media (20% of the total). A further 20% of the total are things which we might reasonably expect to cause people to fear for their saftey - either direct threats, actual incidences of violence or desecration / vandalism of property, so you should be aware that although the total number of incidents might go up or down in a particular year, I don't have data on how the really really serious stuff changes each year.

The authors have gone to some pains to try and distinguish between anti-Jewish and anti-Isreali sentiment. They talk about around 440 incidents which were reported but not included in the final report because they represented attacks on Isreal rather than Jewish people *per se* (alternatively because the attack was made by mistake; they give the example of a Jewish person handed some change with 'Free Palestein' written on it, which would have been anti-semitic if done deliberately, but probably wasn't). They do note that around 38% of anti-semitic attacks also included an anti-Isreal component, making this task quite difficult to carry out perfectly - for example they argue that graffiti saying 'F**k Isreal' should be classified as antisemitic if it is written in an area with a high population of Jewish people, but not if done somewhere else. They do, however, classify comparisons equating Isreal to Nazi Germany as antisemitic, but not comparisons equating Isreal to aparthide South Africa. They argue that comparisons to Nazi Germany have a unique capacity to offend Jewish people and - while I'm sure they are correct - I'm not sure this is a good policy, since it will badly over-count people trying to make a non-offensive political point, but in general the approach looks like a good-faith effort to try and exclude lively political speech from being equated with verbal abuse.

I think, however, the report (and particularly the coverage of it in the mainstream press) is guilty of making it sound like a 'rising trend' towards antisemitism, which does not actually seem to be happening (the *Guardian* - well known for being hopeless with presenting data - have screwed up their graph pretty horribly, but I ran the numbers on Excel). The big rise was almost entirely caused by the not-a-war between Isreal and Palestein last year, with a 400% spike in antisemitic incidents in July and August. Another thing the report fails to look at is whether UK-dwelling Jewish people were passive recipients of this abuse or whether they were inflaming tensions by increasing the level of verbal abuse towards people of Arab extraction at the same time - it would be interesting to see the same methodology repeated with an equivalent group looking at Muslim or Arab people.",null,0,null,1423135706,null,0,false,0,cobx0sk,null,t3_2uurkg,null,t1_cobx0sk,null,t3_2uurkg,null,null,null,1424167553,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

apartheid upsets many Jews, it does not contain

&gt;Look like it or not I am as British as you. If we are going to arbitrarily draw the line at ""Only Anglo Saxons"" then we are going down a road of stupidity.

Great. I'm a second generation asian immigrant. There's not many people living in this country I don't consider to be British.

&gt;No they didn't.

Are you saying that nobody who fucked up legitimately thought that they would get criticized for going after asian men?

have you read pages 32-36? it's 5 pages of the report dedicated to documenting how incompetent this council is in dealing with anything involving minorities. Virtually every perpetrator identified was Pakistani. Here's some quotes

&gt;“Everyone here will say it’s not a race issue, that white people abuse too. That’s true,
but there is a race issue here.” 

A social worker 

&gt;“I got my knuckles rapped by [manager] on that occasion for mentioning Asian taxi
drivers… she had been told [what I’d said] was controversial and not to mention
ethnicity.” 

A youth worker 

&gt;On the ground, individual professionals felt under pressure. “We had specific
instances where taxis were involved [in CSE]. We tried to follow it up with taxi
licensing, but I can’t remember how far we got. We were constantly being reminded
not to be racist.” 

A former social worker 

&gt;“If we mentioned Asian taxi drivers we were told we were racist and the young
people were seen as prostitutes.” 

A former social worker 

&gt;“…you couldn’t bring up race issues in meetings… or you would be branded a
racist.” 

A key partner 

So you think every single one of these people attesting that race was to be kept hushed, every single one of these people is involved in a conspiracy to pass off the poor handling here as being influenced by race? 

Nobody is trying to dehumanize asians, or say that we should assume all asians are involved in CSE. what people are saying is that the fear of being labelled racist is itself a race issue

&gt;Remember. Not one person even bothered contacting the Asian community about the problem. Want to know something? Historically speaking crimes like this have been fought by liason work rather than going ""FUCK IT ASIANS"".

again, that is a race issue. it's not an issue with **the** race, it's an issue with race in general. The fact that so many were worried about being branded a racist, or inviting vigilante attacks from the EDL is a race issue. 

I'm really not sure what your point is. You are arguing against prejudicing asians because of Rotheram and Rochdale, but no sane people are doing that, certainly not the people you replied to. The idea is just that race, or perception of being racist, has been identified as a problem in the report based on testimony from a damn high number of people.

**Price of product:** £9.50 for 150ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots.

**Product claims:** *""The first step to beautiful skin is effective cleansing. Specially formulated to effectively clear away dirt and impurities, No7 Beautiful Skin Melting Gel Cleanser leaves dry complexions feeling as soft and supple as normal skin.*

*The gel develops into a non-drying oil to protect the skin’s natural moisture levels and hydrate dry areas at the same time. It then changes into a light milk formula for easier rinsing, so skin is left residue-free and totally refreshed. What’s more, it’s enriched with rosehip oil to really lock in moisture and offer a fuss-free approach to truly tailored skincare.*

*In trials, 85% of women agreed their skin looked healthier and 86% reported a more radiant complexion after using the gel cleanser.""*

**About you:** Oily, dehydrated, acne-prone skin which is mostly non-sensitive. So this isn't marketed towards me, but I love gel cleansers for helping rehydrate my skin and improve barrier function.

**Your opinion:** I actually really like this cleanser. I apply it on dry skin and gently rub it in for 30 seconds or so, leave it to sit for another 30 seconds, then splash with water and rinse off. It feels quite heavy at first, but it emulsifies into a white milk-y liquid on contact with water and rinses clean. After cleansing my skin feels clean but not stripped - it's nice and gentle, and smells okay. 

I wouldn't use this for removing waterproof makeup, or around my eye area at all. It doesn't sting, but I've got it in my eyes before and it made my vision blurry so I've kept it away from that area since. 

Overall verdict: I like it, and my dehydrated face likes it. I probably wouldn't pay full price, but with a £5 off voucher halving the price I'd buy it again.

The costs of buying a house are generally higher than people realise and it might be worth running the numbers including: mortgage fees, solicitor's fees, stamp duty, and so on.

As for where to save it, the biggest difference over such a short time period will be the amount you save, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't aim for some interest too.

First Direct offer £100 to join them, and pay 6% on a regular saver of up to £300 per month. That's the best rate you'll get on your regular savings.

As for the lump sum (and the proceeds from the first year's regular saver), you can either go for a traditional savings account (1.4% AER is the current top payer) or another current account (Lloyds Club, TSB, Nationwide Flexdirect, Santander 123 all pay 3-5% on different amounts).

The issue with this strategy is the time/effort cost and the fact that each current account application is effectively a credit request. You can minimise the effect by not requesting overdrafts.

From what I hear social workers can construe it as hostility and use it against you if they get involved with your kids and you act all *I know my rights*.

However, it can be very difficult to know what's what, because social services aren't allowed to comment on individual cases, not even to journalists of reputable newspapers. The privacy of the child is paramount.

AFAICT the family courts system is set up so that its overseen by the most senior and trusted judges, and they take these matters very seriously. However, there's no kind of oversight apart from them, because they're supposed to be the best.

I'm sure there's been at least one case where a child was wrongly given up for adoption, against the parents' wishes, and when the case got to appeal the appeal court judged in the parents' favour, but said it was too late now, all adoptions are final and that it's in the child's interest to stay with its new family.

But cellphone numbers are allocated geographically like landline numbers, instead of getting separate number space like pretty much everywhere else.

That created the issue that people can't tell from the number if it is a cellphone or landline number, and so they could not suddenly start charging people higher rates for calling those numbers without causing lots of consumer protection issues.

As a result, the US got reverse charging for mobiles - both voice and sms - the same way we do for roaming (and the reason for charging us for receiving calls when roaming is the same).

Yes, once you've picked a provider for a S&amp;S ISA they should be able to provide you with a form to fill in to transfer in existing ISAs (either S&amp;S or Cash). Be sure to use that kind of form to maintain the ISA wrapper - don't withdraw out of the Cash account or it'll count as a fresh deposit towards the limit when you put it into another account.

&gt;i'd be interested in a Vanguard index tracker, but frankly I don't know where to start!

First things first, there's a separation between the *platform* and the *fund* - Vanguard have a selection of funds, some of them tracking indexes, others combining several trackers into a more complex portfolio. But they only sell units of those funds in serious bulk, so unless you're investing £100k you'd need to go through a platform as a broker. 

Vanguard charge varying fees on money put into their funds - the basic index trackers are pretty dirt cheap though (especially when compared to actively managed funds - you have to pay for the manager and the benefit of doing so is debatable). 

The platform provider will also charge their own fees - different providers will have a different schedule of charges, potentially including fees for the initial account opening, per trade each time you buy into a fund/stock, an annual fee of a fixed amount or a percentage of the funds invested, or exit fees on withdrawal/transferring out.

Which provider makes the most sense depends on how you plan to invest - if you want to put in a single lump that'll sit for years then paying an upfront fee to a provider with no ongoing charges will be best, whereas regular investing is probably best served by a provider with zero fees per trade but a (hopefully low) annual percentage charge. They may also differ in which funds they offer access to, but Vanguard should be fairly universally available, or if not then a similar low-fee index fund from another fund provider.

I've been looking at the various options and (purely on the basis of fees) settled on [Cavendish Online](http://cavendishonline.co.uk/) for regular deposits - their only fee is 0.25%/year, no charge per trade. Potentially also hiving off lump sums at regular intervals from there to [iWeb](http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/share-dealing-home.asp) - they charge £25 to open an account, and £5 fees on each trade, but no ongoing charges (so a good home for a lump sum to be transferred in after it's accumulated).",null,0,null,1423140151,null,0,1423143860,0,coby38g,null,t3_2uris1,null,t1_coby38g,null,t3_2uris1,null,null,null,1424166545,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Young female member of staff was asked by the Manager to check out a cubicle in the female toilets as a lady had been in there a long time.

She went but was advised by the (very drunk) female occupant to ""Fuck Off"".

She returned with the Manager, who was also advised to ""Fuck Off"".

Following this advice a gentleman arrived in the toilets and was admitted to the cubicle by the lady whereupon it is assumed from ensuing noises that copulation had been initiated.

The Manager told them to stop shagging but was advised to ""Fuck Off"". When he threatened to call the Police he was told to ""Fuck Off"".

The Police were called during which time noises of sweet loving could be heard.

The Police told them to stop shagging. They were advised to, you've guessed it, ""Fuck Off"".

The Police broke down the door. The gentleman took exception to his amorous overtures being interrupted and decided to initiate hand to hand combat with the Police. Being outnumbered and very much drunker than his opponents the contest soon resulted in him being cuffed and carried out face down to a waiting van.

The lady was discovered to be laid naked and unconscious on the floor of the cubicle. Unfortunately it was apparent from the bodily fluids around the cubicle that the couple had unwisely chosen a wrong time of the month for their loving.

Shortly after putting on her jeans the lady also decided to attempt hand to hand combat which was soon under control. She declined the offer of putting on more clothes so was taken to the van bare chested, much to the appreciation of the other patrons.

Look at Diego Godin for example. One of Pellegrini's best players at Villareal, he got 4 goals in 110 games over  seasons.

Last season, he got 8 goals alone. Pellegrini just can't organise corners well and we are suffering because of that. We are weak when defending them too. Also, Kompany and Dzeko being injured obviously didn't help.

As for Navas as the taker, Silva would still take them if he was better - it's a set piece, everyone is already out of position, plenty of central players take corners.

Here is what I said...

&gt;they didn't want to investigate because they didn't want to be branded racist

What I am saying is this. The excuse that incidents were ignored, investigations were never started because of the worry of being branded a racist are laughable. As if the police officera are worried about getting a reputation of being racially discriminate, what a joke.

I'm saying that the real reason they didn't investigate is something else and this ""Oh, we didn't want to offend the sex offenders' heritage"" is simply an attempt to push away blame from the police force, who were either helping in on it or being blackmailed/coerced in some way.

Seems like a very convenient way to ignore real issues, feed into a popular racial sentiment within the UK of ""you can't say anything nowadays, otherwise you'll go to jail"" and most pertinently, its a way for the police force to try and squirm their way out of getting any blame ""oh, we wanted to help but we'd have been branded racists, what could we do?""
