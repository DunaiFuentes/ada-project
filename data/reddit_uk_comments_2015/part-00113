But mainly pensions will mean free money. If your employer offers a pension (they all will be required to soon), you should be able to get at least 3% free from them if you pay in 4% of salary, and tax free status will add another 1%. So for a cost to you of 3% you will get 8% contribution. Stick that into a pension for 30 years and it will have added up to something significant.

Apart from that a stocks and shares ISA is a good idea and a chunk left in cash. Buying a house is a very realistic goal for you so think about that - it can be seen as an investment but actually just owning your own place is a really nice way to live.

But, and for me it is a rather large problem that I just can't seem to get over psychologically. They ideologically put the needs of the many over the few time and time again. As a human this does not 'sit right' with me, I know we all say we care about society, but what we really mean is we care about 'our' bit of society, and how society helps 'Me'. 
This is why the other parties get votes and the Greens do not (IMO). The other parties appeal to our own little parts of society not to other peoples parts. 
We are by nature a surviving beast, and like it or lump it, we do this by exploiting everything we can, when we can and to who or what we can. This is just what we are as a species.

A recruiter will ask you to come in for a meeting because they want to interview you to see how you come across and to have the confidence to put you in front of an employer (client) that they work with. Recruitment is about relationship building. You win a relationship with a client and then you have to uphold that relationship, with 25 other recruitment agencies calling that client for their business. The only way to keep that client is to supply valuable candidates. Now, recruitment is incredibly fast-paced. When a recruiter doesn't answer your call, it's because they're busy. They're always busy because there's always something to do. If they're going to be late and they send you an email saying they're late, something will have ran over and they're doing their best to get there. You ask to rearrange and suddenly you become a waste of time and look like you're not interested because you couldn't commit. Recruiters constantly juggle in excess of ten candidates... You're not the center of their world. You're one person who could and probably will jump at the first job offer and you're not even remotely invested in the agency in the first place. 
The fact that you're looking to be self-employed in itself makes you likely to leave a job that a recruiter would get you, therefore damaging the relationship that recruiter has built with a company.

Companies will always offer less money. The fees they pay to agencies are worked into an annual salary. Just because you've applied directly doesn't mean that they haven't had the vacancy vendor to agencies. If you apply directly, it means that you've looked at the wage and have still applied. Company doesn't have to pay a fee and still gets you for less money. Its win win.

Everybody's expectations are high because there isn't really a skill shortage anymore. Great, you have a degree! So do I. Great you've worked in the field of your degree! So have I. Companies want to hire experience for less money to maximise profit. You're one of thirty thousand engineering graduates per year and you're expecting to walk into a job. 

Your portfolio has really good examples in your opinion. You're likely to be invested in the work you make. Other people may not see it that way, because it's subjective. 

I'm going to be totally honest mate. You sound like a dick head with a sense of entitlement which has been fabricated out of some sort of astronomical self-worth. This WILL come across in interviews, which is probably why you haven't had any bites.

After five years of deep spending cuts, the British public has largely come to terms with austerity, and most oppose raising taxes to spend more on services and welfare, according to the most authoritative annual survey of the nation’s political and social attitudes.


Euroscepticism remains relatively strong, with about a quarter of respondents saying they want to leave the EU and 38 per cent calling for a reduction in Brussels’ powers if the UK stays in. When given only a straight in-or-out choice, however, most would opt for continued EU membership by a margin of 57 to 35 per cent.


EU rules giving rights and protections to British workers are also popular: 69 per cent say it is “quite” or “very” important that they are free to secure jobs in other European countries.


This will cheer those who will campaign for Britain to stay in the EU should there be a referendum in 2017, as the Conservatives intend.


The latest British Social Attitudes Survey reveals that support for increasing taxes and spending more on health, education and social benefits has risen slightly to 37 per cent since the last election. But the longer-term trend shows a sharp move against welfare spending: in 2002 63 per cent backed a rise in expenditure.


“This stability suggests that what five years ago might have been regarded as exceptional trends are now part of the fabric of British public opinion,” the report’s authors write. “As such, they are trends of which the next government will have to take due notice.”
The most common position is that tax and spending levels should remain at the levels they are now. The government’s cap on benefits is a popular move, with 73 per cent agreeing that “no household should receive move in benefits than the national average income”.
“Our findings suggest we haven’t reacted against [the cuts] and have accepted the need to constrain taxation and public spending,” said Rachel Ormston, co-head of social attitudes at NatCen Social Research, which undertook the survey. “Still, very few people want to see spending reduced further so it will be interesting to see what happens if the next government imposes more cuts.”
None of the three main parties was advocating anything other than spending constraints, which might help to explain this attitude, Ms Ormston added. “But the question is: are they reflecting public opinion or leading it?”


Despite this muted reaction to the past five years of reforms, the country’s first experiment with coalition government since 1945 has not proved popular. Only 39 per cent now prefer coalition to single-party rule — down from 45 per cent before Nick Clegg and David Cameron announced their partnership a few days after the last election.


Ms Ormston said this was primarily driven by party political concerns. “Support for coalition government among Labour supporters dissolved overnight [in 2010] because they weren’t a part of it,” she said. “But Conservative support also tails off over time, perhaps because Tory supporters feel they could do more if they were not constrained by the Lib Dems.”


Contradicting the widely held notion that the British have become politically apathetic, nearly two-thirds say they follow political news on a daily basis and half discuss politics with family and friends. Interest has been fairly stable for the past three decades, according to the survey, which has been conducted annually since 1983.


Even so, suspicion of politicians and their motives appears to be becoming entrenched. More than half of Britons believe that the government does not much care “what people like me think”, while only 17 per cent of the public trust governments most of the time — little changed since the turn of the century but less than half that recorded in 1986.


The proportion of voters who “very” or “fairly” strongly identify with a political party stands at 37 per cent, down six points from the 1987 election, while the proportion with little or no party affiliation has risen by 16 points to 63 per cent during the same period.
Perhaps the strangest set of findings concerned the NHS, which is at or near the top of voter issues. Despite continuing rows over funding and organisation of the health service, satisfaction with the NHS rose from 2013 to 2014 by five points to 65 per cent, the second-highest level since the survey began.


But while most people accept the NHS faces a funding problem, there is little or no agreement on what to do about it. “The public may still value the NHS but it is far from clear that it is willing to take the medicine that might be needed to ensure that it does not suffer a premature demise,” says the report.
 
Banks start to regain public trust
They have been reviled as architects of the economic crisis and shamed by a series of scandals, but there is finally some good news for banks: the British public are starting to trust them again.
According to the social attitudes survey, the percentage of people saying banks are well run or very well run has risen to 34 per cent, up a full 15 points on 2012. This makes banks better regarded than newspapers, which only 26 per cent say are well or very well run.
Yet it is a far cry from 1983, the first year NatCen Social Research carried out the survey, when there was much greater public respect for large institutions such as banks, the BBC, the NHS and the police. Back then, nine in 10 Britons thought banks were well run.
While that figure had fallen to 63 per cent in 1994, the real collapse in confidence came after the financial crisis broke: in 2009, only 19 per cent of people thought they were properly led.

However I don't think he gets to choose the questions. After all why would he approve the questions of leader of the opposition gets to ask? Or the times when a question is asked which is not one of the ones put forward to the ballot?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister%27s_questions

&gt; Backbench MPs wishing to ask a question must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen to ask a supplementary question if they ""catch the eye"" of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.

http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/questions/

&gt; This means, in theory, that the Prime Minister will not know what questions will be asked of him. However, the Prime Minister will be extensively briefed by government departments in anticipation of likely subjects he could be asked about.

He certainly doesn't get to choose the questions. Obviously he could tell his own MPs what he would like them to ask but he can't do so for any other MPs or any rebels in the back benches.

The problem is, as much as it is important to maintain a positive relationship between the police and the public, sometimes force is needed. Using force will never ever look good. Do you base use of force on public perception of it or do you base it, as it currently is, by level of threat/resistance balanced against level of injury. I think the current system is actually the fairest because it means that there is a clear scale that can be measured against and it means officers don't have to second guess themselves and potentially end up getting injured.

This officer is legally allowed to use CS on this person. As you said the guy is showing passive resistance. The officer told the bloke several times to uncross his arms (verbal commands) which hasn't worked. The officer then goes to the next level of force on the scale which is CS spray. CS spray hurts as you said, however its effects last about 20 minutes then goes away. It is one of the least 'forceful' use of physical force he could use. By that I mean it is the least likely to leave long lasting injury.

This http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2204&amp;issue_id=92010 is an american study but it includes a use of force scale that broadly is the same across most countries. When you see these videos on youtube it looks very quick and like actions aren't being considered. This is not the case, watch again the video and consider the use of force scale and at which stage each use of force is used, imo his actions are legally justified.

Morally, when you get into it, is any use of force against someone else ever justified? it depends on context and it depends on the consequence of not using force. In this video what would happen if no force was used at all? it would be nice to say we are all civilised there would be a nice debate between the officer and the other guy and a general consensus would be met and everyone lives happily ever after.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Its absolutely shit. The place closes at the end of September and opens up again in March. Jobs are seasonal and very low paid and as a result many kids are brought up in low income families and end up with the prospect of leaving school to unemployment, a job wiping old folks backsides or leaving the town.  Unemployment is rife, drug use is high as is crime. In summer you can't move because of fucking tourists, all of whom seem to think they have god given rights to everything and who leave the place looking like an absolute shithole.

Pretty much most seaside towns are on the bones of their arse with little investment and what investment is done is targeted entirely at the tourists, fuck the locals they just live there. An example in Bridlington was the Spa Theatre. Millions spent on a theatre that benefited tourists and everyone over 60. They dug up the 500 yards of the road around it and replaced it with stone blocks so it matched the theme of the building. And then they spent £100,000s digging them all up and changing them because they were the wrong shade. And at the same time the local authority was closing down stuff for kids because of lack of funding.

As a kid you spend a fair bit of time on the beach but after a while you just stop going there because its either full of tourists or freezing cold and you've seen it countless times already.

And don't get me started on the fucking blue rinse brigade. They'll move to the place to retire because they remember the good times on holiday. And they will actively do absolutely everything they can to prevent any change from what they remember it being like in the 60's. They will campaign against any development, any projects to help the kids or to bring industry to the place. The stuff the kids do like jumping into the sea off the harbour wall which we had done in the town for over half a century, they campaigned to get outlawed because they couldn't bear to see anyone have fun. They got by-laws made to prevent kids congregating on the seafront during summer evenings because they felt the kids didn't have the right to enjoy it because they wanted to sit there with their fucking chips feeding the bastard seagulls. And they will bitch and moan and fucking whine to anyone who will listen when it gets to the first winter and they actually find out what its really like to live there.

The town I was born in, Bridlington, almost everyone I went to school with left by their early 20s. Everyone I know from school who is still there are on the bones of their arse, struggling to get by.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed living there as a kid until I was maybe 12 or so but looking back that was basically because I didn't know any better. Looking back I can see now how absolutely shite it actually was but without anything else to compare it to at the time I didn't know better.",null,0,null,1427365867,null,0,1427366500,0,cpr8ctu,null,t3_30b6rv,null,t1_cpr8ctu,null,t3_30b6rv,null,null,null,1432022538,null,37,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,37,null

null,false,Milemarker80,null,null,null,"In the interest's of fairness, from an insider's point of view, the many current issues the NHS faces isn't exclusively down to the current government.  But they definitely aren't helping.

We're currently expecting that hospital Trusts will end the financial year £1 billion in deficit nationally this year.  This alone is looking like it'll blow straight through the £8 billion needed by 2020 quoted in some parts over the last couple of years.  That's a pretty straight forward lack of funding (although there are also significant efficiency issues in play across massive swathes of the NHS, with many Trusts not embracing cost saving technologies, or just being incredibly badly run).

Other major factors feeding into both the financial issues and performance issues are local authority funding, which has been massively cut, resulting in less social services, both residential and day care / support wise.  This generally means patients are staying longer in hospital before a care package can be implemented and that they are readmitted more often due to a lack of support.

The inability of the NHS to react to changes in the populations healthcare needs is also a major factor.  Especially in younger, inner city areas, patients expect a healthcare system that meets their needs, on their terms and the NHS hasn't adapted quickly enough to that.  We're seeing significant increases in the use of urgent care services, as other parts of the NHS just aren't accessible in the manner patients want.

The problem is that we're in the position of having to redesign how huge parts of the NHS work, with less funding and resources than ever before while the current system is straining under the weight of increased patient demand.  With current funding, we can't manage to both address demand and redevelop services simultaneously.  Even with a huge cash injection, it will take years to recover from the current issues - services can't be redesigned overnight and we can't magic up staff for current (or future) services instantly.

Hell, staff wise alone, we need to urgently produce a long term plan for how students are attracted to NHS roles, trained and what clinical roles we'll need to be filled in 5 years time, when they graduate and start work. No organisation in the NHS is currently looking at this at a national level, which is deeply troubling considering the current thinking on moving care out of the hospital setting into the community.

I do believe that there is a facet of humour that allows us to explore the absurdity of prejudice by magnifying and amplifying it to even more absurd proportions (I do not think Boyle treads this ground often; he does seem, in my limited experience, more of a shock-comic). I think Steve Coogan made this point far better in his 2011 piece about the Mexican slurs on Top Gear by comparing his character of Alan Partidge to Clarkson.

My original point wasn't to forgive either party their output but rather to highlight that the point Boyle is making is that he comes under far more fire because his jokes are often topical to culturally sensitive items. This means that when he comes under criticism for them; it is easy for the line to be drawn between our sense of offence at what has been said and the root cause of this feeling.

With Clarkson, he throws out a nursery rhyme with archaic and hurtful language but it can be, by comparison, seemingly forgiven, because it does not hinge on any one item or person but rather a cultural understanding that what he is saying is slightly taboo. And with that glint in his eye he knows you get it and he panders to his demographic. And with that i wholeheartedly agree with Boyle that this behaviour is a cultural tumour that must not be tolerated.

and to everyone saying that he did not really 'pronounce' the word in the rhyme but rather mumbled it... does that 'magically' make it ok?!

But the average first time buyers price is somewhere in the region of £170,000 (which incidentally is beyond the reach of most people on an average salary without being helped out with a deposit by their parents), so they're going to have to build a large number of houses that cost significantly more than the £220,000 mark as they'll have to have loss leaders that are affordable. Obviously the more houses you can cram on a plot the better the profit margin, the more affordable homes that can be built. It's a bit of a vicious circle which only a massive land owner who doesn't need to make a profit on the land it owns can resolve by flooding the market with a significant number of affordable houses to reduce the land costs - but then it needs to be equally distributed, or the distribution of the affordable homes to be focussed on the areas where the costs of housing has disproportionately increased.",null,0,null,1427368376,null,0,false,0,cpr8ycf,null,t3_30cvqf,null,t1_cpr8ycf,null,t1_cpr8mv9,null,null,null,1432022819,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Second, why give Fabregas a free pass? He and Oscar were two of the most indispensible players for our side in the first half of the season. They're both currently in the middle of bad runs of form, and both have histories of being like that, so far. However, Cesc has an even more established history of tailing off in the second half of seasons, having done it all the way back to his years at Arsenal. You mention the ""style of Mourinho"" regarding Marin, but the hounding defense of Oscar is a significant element of his game that Mourinho loves to have in his players, so talking about Cesc replacing Oscar on the pitch without mentioning he is significantly worse at defense than Oscar (an element of his game that got Mata relegated to the bench and eventually sold) seems specious.

I'm not giving you heat, per se; I just really don't agree with where you're heading. Would you have wanted this change during the first half of this season, when they were rather seamlessly interchanging positions and looking generally brilliant on the pitch? I ask that mainly because those were the roles Mourinho envisioned for those two players, and if not for both of their seemingly chronic bad form later on in the season, they would still be showing his intent fantastically.

To me, the question needs to become figuring out how to stop those two from always dipping in form in the second half. Outside of that, if agree we need a more creative force on the right, but Mourinho seems to see that in Cuadrado, so I'm hoping that will pan out once he gets up to speed with his new teammates (probably/hopefully by next season).",null,0,null,1427368382,null,0,false,0,cpr8yek,null,t3_308dhc,null,t1_cpr8yek,null,t1_cpq88xh,null,null,null,1432022819,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;It was my understanding that free movement within the EU is a consequence of the euro and required for an optimum currency area to smooth out asymmetric shocks. As such I think there is scope for the UK to impose limits on EU immigration. We also need to think carefully about which sectors we want to import people to work in, and how long we allow them to stay here...

Nope, the free movement of labour within the EU is a consequence of there being a [single market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market). There are no import tariffs/quotas etc., so assets are free to move around between countries, to the economic benefit of the countries involved. You cannot realistically have a single market without workers in that market having access to labour independent of geographical location (the local equivalent would be saying only skilled people from Newcastle will be allowed to live and work in London from next year. If you're trying to create a fair and integrated economic environment across the country, then it's the wrong stance to take). The freedom of movement is a [founding principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers) of the European Union and it has been stated [before](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/eu-freedom-of-movement-non-negotiable-germany) that if we want to restrict EU migration against the principle of free movement, then we will no longer be in the single market; i.e. we will have to leave the EU.

As the report shows the crowding is on commuter trains.  Once hs2 is built all of the express services will move over the stuff currently run by virgin. These services are made faster as a bonus,  since we are building a new line why wouldn't we make it high speed.  It's being speced for 420kph so eventually it could save even more time.

&gt; We support a continuation of existing nuclear power and more research in to new nuclear technology particularly the use of thorium and fusion.

When did this become a thing? Last time I checked the official party website (a couple of months ago) it stated that the Greens were anti-nuclear. Seems they [still are](https://www.greenparty.org.uk/we-stand-for/safe-climate.html) (full manifesto is not yet available).

&gt; We totally oppose fracking, more fossil fuels are just not the answer especially with environmental damage done by the extraction process in fracking.

Fossil fuels are still required, although I'd consider them more like ""plastic ore"" rather than a fuel. AIUI fracking is safe if done correctly, so perhaps tighter regulation is what's required? And please, please, please do not quote the tripe that is ""Gasland"" as a rebuttal. Especially *that* scene with the water being burnt.

GMOs could help with the creation of base oils for further production, but it seems the Greens are anti-GMO; so how do you square that particular circle?

&gt; We will end austerity and increase public spending, this will stimulate growth allowing the economy to recover and crucially provide essential public services.

Will this be on-book public spending, or more PFI-hide-the-numbers-penalise-the-future bullshit?

&gt; In the long term we must end our economy's reliance on growth, it is clearly ridiculous to expect infinite growth in a finite world. 

Yup. Always puzzled me how we can grow ad infinitum. OK, technology does help (being able to to more with less) but panicking because the economy didn't grow seems pointless, so long as the standard of living improves; who gives a shit?

&gt; Establish an employee shares scheme to allow staff to own their companies.

Like back-in-the-day when workers used to own shares in the mill? It's a good idea, but at times hard-nosed decisions still have to be made. Probably better that it's done by the workers themselves than aloof executives.

&gt; We will tighten laws to prevent tax avoidance

Tax avoidance is a non-issue. Tax *evasion* is what you mean. Unless you are going to tell me that you willingly pay **more** tax than you are due to pay?

Have you considered the possibility of taxing gross income rather than simply profit? It's **much** harder to hide cash landing in the till.

&gt; We will take private business out of the NHS and fix the damage done by schemes like Private Finance Initiatives (PFI).

I'm cool with private business being in the NHS (after all, we want the NHS to concentrate on health not other duties) and see no issue with them hiring in outsiders for particular services/supplies etc. I am *not* cool with the NHS being forced into using private companies when they could do it themselves faster/better/cheaper. I would love to know how you will break the PFI stranglehold - renege on contracts? (FYI, I am opposed to PFI).

&gt; We will abolish outdated intellectual property law, such as that regarding 'format shifting'.

Too late, [that's been done](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2014/victory-format-shifting-and-parody-clear-last-hurdle). Worrying that you do not know this, and it calls into question your entire ability to comment on this area. As does your use of the nonsense term ""intellectual property"". What you are referring to here is copyright.

Hold the fuck on.

During the kickup over the Ray McCreesh playpark, it was found that 84% of residents were in favour of, or at least indifferent to, naming it after McCreesh. It was argued that, because it was in a predominantly Nationalist area, that the community had the right to honour what they felt were heroes from their side of the divide just as Loyalist areas have the right to put up murals for King Rat, for example.

One of the arguments put forward for the opposition of the name was that the Unionists disagreed with Nationalists saying it was *their* area, that everywhere should be a cross community area. That's not the way it works, and I think that's something that we can all agree on. There'll never be a Michael Collins mural on the Shankhill.

He punched Peers Morgan.  As I've said, that doesn't count because Peers lost his right to a soul with his actions.  As such punching him is morally fine.

Punching a producer who works for you, who by some rumours was one of the last people who could put up with his arrogance and demand for his *vision* being obeyed, that's not acceptable at all, but from what has been published, this is the first time he ever did that.

That isn't over and over.  It's not in the same league.

&gt;This is the BBC though so it's a different game

I'm a director of a newish company, we've got an office in some shared building space, it's shall we say economic?  The toilets we share with other offices are not great.  One Saturday, my co-founder found a drivers license covered in white powder.  After we've been laughing at what kind of looser addict would use their own state issued identity card license (more so now atomiser swabs are common) to cut lines, there was an awkward pause.  He turned to me and said *you'd have an intervention, you'd make me go to rehab, you'd stop me long before I got to this kind of situation right?* my reply was *of course, you'd do the same for me right*.  That's what you expect from a company that can afford to treat it's staff compassionately.

This has been handled badly by the bbc from day one.  Suspending JC gave them no other option but to fire him, not least because of the massive economic fall out of his actions (syndication penalty clauses will be interesting to see on the beebs accounts next year).  Worse yet, it's put the victim of the assault into the public spotlight.  Whilst I can't profess to know his mind, if he is like me (and I've been assaulted after work, but by someone who was technical junior, so bit different) he wouldn't want the whole production and project scrapped, he'd probably be far happier with an apology and a massive wad of cash.  Now he will be forever tarnished in his industry, and that's before we even get to the weirdos, 350m viewers, there will be some really odd weirdos....

So in short, I'm appalled the BBC let it get to this state, if his behaviour and drinking was so out of hand, management should have intervened, it's become clear the last few years how the BBC has turned a complete blind eye to the behaviour of it's talent.

Secondly, and more importantly, there is equity. The good thing about mortgages most of the time is that if worst comes to worst and you can't make the payments you can simply sell your home and pay off the debt (and if you've already paid some of it off and/or house prices have increased you'll have some extra money in your pocket). If house-prices decrease you'll have people in the situation where even if they sold their home they couldn't pay off the mortgage they took out to pay for it. This not only makes home-owners worried that they may not be able to cover their debts but also makes banks worried too as they suddenly have debts on their balance sheets that are suddenly risky. Once banks start to get worried like this they stop lending and the knock-on effects are terrible. Businesses need loans all the time so if that line of finance dries up the whole economy falls over itself and dies.

'Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he said the coalition's plan was ""failing dismally"". Instead of cutting spending the government should be increasing it by 2% of GDP, he added.

""It is deeply destructive to pursue austerity in a depression,"" said Krugman. ""Give me a stronger economy and I'll turn into a fiscal hawk. But not now.""'

Right now you get less jail time for rape than for murder, so if you rape someone, there's no incentive to kill them. If it's automatic life sentence for both murder and rape, you might as well kill your victim.

Likewise say you have a rapist who was part of pedophile ring or something, if they automatically have a life sentence without release, or the death penalty, and it's mandatory, how can you cut a deal with them? Commuting someone's 45 year jail sentence to 20 might be worth it if you're going to catch 20 other rapists.

But with self-service scanners, with enough confidence, you can steal things, but them in the bags provided and even get help doing so! 

An old work colleague of mine used to do simple things to get things considerably cheaper - one of the things he offered to me as a suggestion was, because we are both into working out, tuna. He would get let's say 9 tins of the good brand tuna, he would then get 1 tin of the store's own brand, making sure they were the same weight though (which is usually the case with tuna). He would then scan the store's own tuna, and put the premium ones onto the weight measuring baggage area. 

Another thing is that the basket area isn't weighed, so when you have one or two (usually the priciest one or two) items left, you click 'pay' on the screen and then the bagging area stops screaming ""unexpected item"" if you put a bag or another product on there (this is so that people can put their backpacks and handbags on there to get their wallets or put their shopping in them) and you can just put the few pricey items into the bags while your payment is being processed, unless you are being actively watched, you're not likely to be noticed or caught. 

- Just to say I don't actually do any of these, and I'm sure there are many more tricks, these are just a couple of tricks I've been told or have pondered when I walk around.

null,false,534e47,,Belfast,null,"  From reading the article, something here comes across as a little strange. A qoute in the article (towards the end) is stated as follows,
""Many evangelical Protestants are ardent fans of the national team and would dearly love to be present at the match. We wonder what efforts, if any, were made to have Sunday’s fixture re-arranged."" What I find odd here was that back when I was young and forced to go to church I was taught the following...... ""And he [Jesus] said to them, 'Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life'""(Luke 18:29-30). So if the Bible (the actual word of God in Christians opinion), states that whatever you have to give up for God, it/he/she will receive much more in your life-time and eternal life. So are these people who plan to protest not going against the word of their God? Does the pasage in Luke not say, give up what you have to for God? And if so, how can these people justify literally going against the advice of God?

 The other thing I found funny was this: ""A Christian protest  is expected to take place on Sunday. The Evangelical Protestant Society has issued a statement in which it said the football match was ""yet another step towards erosion of Lord's day in Northern Ireland"". This is a complete contradiction in terms. How can a person protest the will of others not to rest, by not in fact resting themselves? I take this idea from the Christians' Bible, were it clearly says, ""You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.""(Exodus 31:14). So is the opinion of these people that anyone who does not rest should be put to death?

 I think we already knew the answer to this, but this group of people are simply fundamentalists. They take a very strict view on their religious records and then seek to have society follow their rules. I was going to write a closing argument about these people, but in trying to find those Bible verses, I actually found a great answer to the question ""Is it a sin to work on Sunday?"" (along with [link](http://www.gotquestions.org/working-on-Sunday.html).

""In Colossians 2:16-17, the apostle Paul declares, “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.” We are no longer commanded to cease working on the Sabbath, nor is Sunday now the “Christian Sabbath.” Although many Christians prefer to take Sunday off and spend at least part of it in corporate worship, working on Sunday is not sin. Many Christians, such as doctors and nurses, have no choice but to work on Sunday and, as a society, we should be very grateful to them. But Christians who work on Sunday should do so with the understanding that worship is not limited to any one day of the week, but is to be an ongoing part of their lives.""

 Fundamentalist are constantly taking up the headlines with bad press.

*tl;dr - the ruling isn't really about FOI or republicanism, or privacy, but about the power of the Government to overrule a finding of a court.*

A copy of their ruling can be found [here](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/21.html). The Court was split 3:2:1:1 on the matter, with what look like some fairly strongly worded back-and-forth discussions between their opinions (criticising each other). It's important to remember that the main issue wasn't whether the letters should be released (the Court didn't see them) but whether the Government had the power to overrule the decision of a court, ordering the release.

From the first opinion:

&gt; A statutory provision which entitles a member of the executive (whether a Government Minister or the Attorney General) to overrule a decision of the judiciary merely because he does not agree with it would not merely be unique in the laws of the United Kingdom. It would cut across two constitutional principles which are also fundamental components of the rule of law.

This is, in their opinion, what this veto power does. It gives the government a power to simply ignore or overturn a court ruling. Which is quite a dangerous idea.

However, as the final (dissenting) opinion notes, the reasoning used is paradoxical, as it claims:

&gt; … it is not reasonable for an accountable person to issue a [veto] simply because, on the same facts and admittedly reasonably, he takes a different view from that adopted by a court of record after a full public oral hearing.

He would almost certainly point to the US as an example of this.

If you could analyze his view point now in the context of the current situation, that would be more worthwhile. Otherwise I don't see much of a reason to disregard his opinion. 

For the record, as an SNP supporter, this is something we have been saying for a while. That taking a less conservative approach to the issue would be more beneficial. We look to the US to see that austerity, as a be-all/end-all package, isn't the most efficient option. Particularly because austerity has a habit of screwing the pooch - people that rely on government services are disproportionately affected by sweeping cuts / tax increases that austerity demands. The bedroom tax is a good example of this, something the SNP have worked really hard on mitigating for Scottish constituents. 

Personally I can't help but think that the austerity narrative is driven in Europe by the Germans. Which is something that countries like Greece simply need (because of how toxic their economy was/still is) but something that the UK shouldn't need to take part in, especially now as we turn the corner and the economy starts to grow.

Human error describes a wide range of events, not just unintentional, but also intentional.

Quoting Wikipedia source: Human Error: Cause, Prediction, and Reduction

&gt;Human error means that something has been done that was ""not intended by the actor; not desired by a set of rules or an external observer; or that led the task or system outside its acceptable limits"".[1] In short, it is a deviation from intention, expectation or desirability.

I would say that crashing into the ground on purpose deviates outside of expecation and desirability, even if from the individuals perspective it was intentional.

And further, human error in piloting terms has a more relevent description:

&gt;Usually in an accident caused by pilot error, it is assumed that the pilot in command (captain) makes an error unintentionally. However, an intentional disregard for a standard operating procedure (or warning) is still considered to be a pilot error, even if the pilot's actions justified criminal charges.

null,false,Moolemon,null,null,null,"Hello, it's great you're considering Edinburgh! I have lived here for 14 years now and it's a beautiful city!

1. Housing in Edinburgh is more expensive than for example Glasgow. It obviously depends on the area that you want to live in. Nice areas with decent-ish priced flats to start out in could be somewhere like Bruntsfield or Tollcross. Just don't try to find a flat during the summer- all you will find are short-term lets at extortionate prices for the festival.

2. No idea about health care if you're coming in from abroad. If you're paying taxes and such I'm guessing you'd be on the NHS but I don't know too much about moving here and registering for the NHS. Once you move, you should register for a doctor. Healthcare/hospitals/prescriptions are free. Stuff like orthodontics are not, unless the care would benefit your health.

3. I don't know, sorry. 

4. Try s1 jobs, and indeed.co.uk. Gumtree is alright! I'd maybe try gumtree to find a flat to start out in. It's not the best for jobs but worth a look- personally I find searching on gumtree easier than the other job sites. Once you're in touch with the manager or the HR, it's a lot more face-to-face anyway.

5. Scotland is a really lovely friendly place! Edinburgh's a bit more uptight than Glasgow I've found, just more of a middle-class culture. During the Fringe festival, we cannot be beaten for culture.

That's really upsetting to hear about your last trip to the UK. Just out of interest, where was it you visited? 
I'm white/English descent so can't speak too much for cultural acceptance personally, but I have never encountered racism or witnessed it.

One thing I'd li,e to add is that I'm just out of a teaching degree, and have done experience in schools in Edinburgh. Tollcross primary school is one I would love to recommend- for Scotland, it's a very culturally diverse school, and half Gaelic if that's what you're into (more job prospects for kid). South Morningside Primary is where I went as a child and a really good school, not so culturally diverse though. The Tollcross nursery is also really nice and welcoming- I worked there for 3 weeks and it's next door to the primary school.

As in A will date B, C and D for maybe a month, then decide they don't want to see D anymore so they'll continue going on dates with B and C for another few weeks before making their mind up. It's usually no more than 3-4 dates as far as I know but even so, I don't think that's acceptable here.  

As I said though, it's more equivalent to courting. You wouldn't expect sex or really even going back to someone's place after the date unless you've gone exclusive. But it's socially acceptable to be casually seeing other people. I think that's the difference.

Here, in my experience at least, inviting someone on a date is like saying ""I'm interested in a relationship with you and want to get to know you better and see how we get on"", whereas in the US it's ""I find you attractive, let's see how we get on before I decide whether I'm interested in a relationship"".

&gt;During the kickup over the Ray McCreesh playpark, it was found that 84% of residents were in favour of, or at least indifferent to, naming it after McCreesh. It was argued that, because it was in a predominantly Nationalist area, that the community had the right to honour what they felt were heroes from their side of the divide just as Loyalist areas have the right to put up murals for King Rat, for example.

The playpark is publicly funded, the ratepayers McCreesh was involved in killing and their families have to pay for his glorification. Murals aren't funded by the council, nor is the memorial in the news story, it was put up without the NIHE permission.

&gt;One of the arguments put forward for the opposition of the name was that the Unionists disagreed with Nationalists saying it was *their* area, that everywhere should be a cross community area. That's not the way it works, and I think that's something that we can all agree on. There'll never be a Michael Collins mural on the Shankhill.

Yea well I'm really going to have to disagree that the city centre, beside the sports centre and the SRC should belong to one section of the community. That nothing really of that type in a residential area in south Belfast, but it still shouldn't be there.

Now I can understand why there haven't been many complaints, apart from of course the NIHE who owns the property and has been locked out, because it's quite discrete I've walked passed it on quite a few occasions and never really examined it.

&gt; So far, all the 'evidence' you've brought to this discussion is a Wikipedia article based on what happened 30 years ago.

Perhaps you are not aware, but Wikipedia sources most of its information. I know its difficult, but you can click on the little numbers next to a piece of information; and the site will take you to its bibliography...

What a day we live in huh?

&gt; the ONLY issue in fact- upon which the 'special relationship' isn't strong. 

Syria? Obama wanted us to commit to an invasion with them. We didn't.

Ukraine? The senate wanted to arm Ukrainians. We backed the EU's softly softly approach.

Palestine? America is a staunch ally of Israel, whilst our DPM has recently announced we will recognise Palestine if Israel doesn't improve its treatment of Palestinians.

Sure, you keep believing that we agree on literally everything except the Falklands; and I'll keep showing you instances of how this is absolutely false.

&gt; (and read more about it, the US ambassador to the UK was an outspoken supporter of Argentina and the move was hugely divisive domestically for Regan) 

Hmmm, should I listen to the President of America and his Secretary of Defence; or do I listen to the US ambassador to the UK who incidentally said nothing after the US administration officially came down on our side.

&gt;  was only to safeguard ECHELON and other significant SIGINT hardware based in the south Atlantic which is now obsolete.

Source? I think it was more the fact a Cold War was going on.

&gt; There's a different president, a different world, and even our own government have indicated the us cannot be relied upon.

I agree, they cannot be relied upon. I have never stated they could be, I'm simply saying you cannot be sure of their response given past events. In fact i even said this to you in my last response. Nice reading skills buddy.

&gt; But you carry on believing what you believe.

Oh I will, no random baseless-opinionated redditor will sway my beliefs. I'm sorry I don't believe the garbage you spew but I like evidence and empirical data. Not unrelated historical events plucked out your arse with no implication on current affairs.

&gt; Neither of us will convince the other and you started out by being wrong about the carrier so at least you're consistent.

Oh, this is a gem. I was wrong about the sea trials date, you where wrong about the ""not being operational until 2020"" and yet clearly I'm the one who will be consistently wrong for eternity.

You are a very intelligent person... That was sarcasm ;)

&gt; The Crimea comment was a deliberately patently absurd illustration of my point.

It was one of the worst arguments I have ever come across for proving whether the US would back a Falklands re-taking or not. Infact it's actually laughable that you still cling to it like some sort of instant debate winning peice of information.

&gt; OF COURSE the world's different now. 

Oh, you finally realised huh gramps?

&gt; Rest assured though, the fact that it went quite so far over your head and riled you so much is as amusing as it is adorable.

No they were not. The best performing countries are the ones who either didn't do austerity (i.e. the US) or abandoned their austerity program half way through (i.e. us). The ones who followed through on their austerity program (Greece, Spain, etc) look like disaster zones.

&gt; So he was categorically wrong. Cutting the deficit combined with QE worked, and he was simply wrong to say it wouldn't.

There has been no real cutting of the deficit the past 3 years. In fact the only real deficit cut in that time came because the economy started to grow.

&gt; What happened? The economy began growing strongly 6 months later:
http://m.bbc.com/news/10613201[2]

The growth followed on from the Tories pretty much abandoning their austerity program. The austerity happened in 2010 and was disastrous. Since then we've seen a real revenue neutral with a structural deficit cut. Austerity means real deficit cut now.

Krugman got it pretty spot on. The moment the Tories abandoned real austerity the economy recovered.

Let's cut that down a little.

The captain engaged the reverse thrusters while in flight, and despite the first officer and flight engineer's restraining him and trying to regain control, they couldn't save the plane.

In 1987 a Los Angeles to San Francisco [Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1771), a BAe 146, was hijacked by a former employee of the airline's parent company, who used his employee credentials to bring a gun past security. He killed four or five people on board, including the man who fired him, and flew the plane into the ground.

In 1994 a Memphis to San Jose [Federal Express Flight 705](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Express_Flight_705), a DC-10, was hijacked by a disgruntled employee who intended to murder the crew and crash the plane, in order for his family to receive a life insurance pay out. Despite all three crew members on board receiving blows to the head, they managed to subdue the hijacker and land the plane safely.

In 1994 a Agadir to Casablanca [Royal Air Maroc Flight 630](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Maroc_Flight_630), an ATR 42, crashed ten minutes after take-off, killing 44 people. It was ruled to be a suicide by the pilot.

In 1997 a Jakarta to Singapore [SilkAir Flight 185](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SilkAir_Flight_185), a Boeing 737, crashed into the Musi River killing 107 people. The Indonesian NTSC gave a ruling of ""technical investigation has yielded no evidence as to the cause of the accident"", three days after the American NTSB (who join the investigation if the aircraft involved was American made, regardless of where it crashes) announced their finding of ""the accident airplane’s flight profile is consistent with sustained manual nose-down flight control inputs"". The Indonesian authorities didn't want to scare people off flying, hence the differing reports.

In 1999 a Los Angeles to Cairo [EgyptAir Flight 990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EgyptAir_Flight_990), a Boeing 767, crashed into the Atlantic, killing 217 people. Once again there was disagreement into the cause; the Egyptian ECAA ruled it to be a failure of the elevator control system, while the NTSB ruled it to be caused by the deliberate actions of the first officer. This time the disagreement was due to a cultural attitude towards suicide.

In 2013 a Maputo, Mozambique to Luanda, Angola [LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAM_Mozambique_Airlines_Flight_470), an Embraer 190, crashed in Namibia's Bwabwata National Park, killing 33 people.

 I personally do not believe in a God, but having grown up in a religious home I found logic and science generally do not help when arguing your point with Christians. A problem I have with  is how they pick and choose the parts of the Bible they live by. Fundamentalist seem (to me) to take many laws from the old testament, but decide that the punishments are outdated. This is the subject I wanted to highlight most in my original post, but I think I beat around the bush a little too much.

 You make a great point about shellfish, and it reminded me of a point which I always ask Christians when talking to them. If the Bible forbids eating shellfish(or pork) and homosexuality, why is it ok for a Christian to now eat shellfish(or pork), but not be gay? Like you said, each person seems to pick the parts they like and run with that. Most of the time this is no problem, and I am happy to allow every person to their own beliefs and opinions, however when certain minority groups attempt to force their opinions onto the majority, even despite the lack of good to society, then my mind tends to close to them.

 In short, you are 100% right, if we are allowed to make clothes out of multiple fabrics and eat shellfish, then people should be allowed to spend their time however they desire on a Sunday.

Our society should be built on the needs of the many, and not the desires of a few (not to go all philosophical).",null,0,null,1427378153,null,0,false,0,cprcn0f,null,t3_30cshm,null,t1_cprcn0f,null,t1_cprauxt,null,null,null,1432024626,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

Its too long. It contains tons of redundant information. Saying you're available for salaried roles at the start of a CV makes you look money focused. Including your salary and when it was raised makes it look like you're only interested in remuneration. Putting your reason for leaving, as well as being quite defamatory makes you look bitter and likely to defame any company you work for. 

Your nationality isn't ""United Kingdom"", it's British and is still irrelevant. If you were the exact same person but your nationality was North Korean, would you expect to be treated differently?

The fact that you can drive is irrelevant. Having a section on 'commuting' is laughable. You could fly a helicopter for all anyone cares, as long as you turn up. It'd be different if you were applying to be a courier driver. But you're not.
Also, the play-by-play of what to expect in each section header is not required - hiring managers aren't idiots.

Your CV is meant to get your foot in the door, where you then attempt to sell your behaviours and attitude to a recruitment consultant or a key decision maker. You forget that these recruitment consultants have been hired by companies to represent them and their wishes, which is why they want to meet you.

Without even meeting you I've framed a preconception that you feel like you're worth 40k+ a year, that you're defamatory of companies with which you've worked. You're interested in only what a company can do for you and not what you can do for a company. You're disrespectful of other people's work (I believe you called it ""monkey simple""). You're not modest, believing your work is good and not really addressing room for improvement and overall, you have some large sense of entitlement. 

Also, being ""willing to entertain"" some ideas about why you're not being successful is not the same as actually taking constructive criticism. You being the problem is your 4th consideration. In actuality, it's your first and only. You are looking for a job. You aren't getting a job. You.

The whole process moved incredibly quickly for me, but I wouldn’t say this was the norm. From me clicking submit on the online application to receiving a job offer was exactly 2 weeks. The process was pretty standard, see below, but usually this would take much longer. Maybe even 2 months+. 
 
Most applications open late summer, to start a year later.
 
Application process   
1.       Online application    
a.       CV    
b.      Covering letter    
c.       Application specific questions (in my case, a couple of small essays about the future of the industry)   
2.        Online test 
a.       Numeric
b.      Reasoning 
c.       Interpersonal 
3.       1st phone interview – Mainly just a chat to make sure you can hold a conversation. Some questions like “Tell me about a time you’ve worked in a team.” “How would you handle a situation where you knew you could not deliver on time.” 
4.       2nd phone interview – Technical. For me this included things about programming, and various other computer science things. 
5.       Assessment centre – Put me up in a hotel in London for the night and the centre started very early the next morning.   
a.       Meet and great breakfast with other applicants and senior employees who would later conduct interviews – an ice breaker really    
b.      1st interview – quality based, testing your morals and such, finding out a bit more about you and your hobbies, personality etc. Talk over your CV.    
c.       2nd interview – technical, more course and role related questions – in my case incredibly hard, but they don’t expect you know the full answer, its often about approach    
d.      Team task – a problem solving task with 5 other applicants. Can be quite difficult, but you just need to show problem solving skills.    
e.      Online tests retake – this is just to make sure that you didn’t cheat on the online exams.      
6.       Wait and see if you get an offer    
    
As I said for me all this only took 2 weeks. They were super organised. But for some of my friends it took months. 
    
As you said you’re a mature student (I don’t know how mature) but one of my colleagues who started at the same time as me was 33 and got on to same grad scheme I did. So you’re still in the running for grad schemes all the same you would be for another job, and they’re a brilliant way to go (certainly in finance industry, and chemistry as weird as it sounds is perfect to do so). You get a great wage, a decent golden handshake, the benefits are great (pension, share options, private healthcare), continued learning and genuine career progression opportunities.

My argument though, is that the Hijab isn't a religious garment. It's not a part of Islam and is actually a fairly recent development. It mainly signifies female obedience to her male superior. Be that her father or husband.

The current line of succession still largely operates in terms of  male-preference cognatic primogeniture (as the Act that allows elder daughters to succeed over younger sons doesn't apply to anyone born before 2011), and no action is necessary for the heir apparent to assume the throne - it happens automatically, they don't have to be crowned or confirmed.

Therefore, Charles **will** be King, and there isn't anything anyone can do to stop it - short of Parliament abolishing the monarchy (again), or amending the rules of succession.

As to why abdication isn't straightforward: there is no formal mechanism governing abdication. If a monarch wants to abdicate, an Act of Parliament needs to be passed. There's no list of acceptable reasons for abdication either, it would be assessed on a case-by-case basis - Edward VI's abdication happened only because he wanted to marry a divorcee, which the Church of England would not sanction, and the head of the Church of England (the monarch) can't be at odds with the Church's basic tenets.

As for things like multiple fabrics and the other commonly spouted things they are Old Testament laws that have been fulfilled by Jesus and are no longer required.

As for the gay thing there is no specific line that invalidates that from either Jesus or a message from God whereas there are several opinions given by other people in regards to it.

It was awesome in the mid to late 90s as we had two clubs and a vibrant after club party scene. Plus there used to be quite a lot of jobs there within factories and hospitality. 

Things are different now though,both clubs are shut, one got knocked down to build another retirement home on some of the best real estate in town and the other is a restaurant/bar. Plus the council have had loads of houses built so there isn't enough jobs for everyone now. The scene in town now is very much a piss head one and the one club is like a meat market where men outnumber girls maybe 3/1. 

Low wages, high rent and extremely high house prices in relation to wages. It's the same problem across Cornwall. 

If you're into not having much money or working crappy minimum wage jobs just so you can live by the beach for the 3 months of the year the weather is OK, then Bude is for you. Oh also if you want a second home or to retire you might also consider it.

He could sell you the whole house at a large discount, but in that case any assessment for care home costs may consider him to have been deliberately removing assets. 

In addition, if he plans to keep any benefit from the property (i.e. live there at any stage) there would be complications with one or both of Pre-Owned Assets Tax and the gift-with-reservation rules.

If the property could easily be converted into two self-contained dwellings (brick up the stairs and put a new entrance on the first floor) you could *potentially* have the title split and buy half, but this will not be without significant costs and will take some time.

The short answer is that what you're proposing is unlikely to work.

Yes, we can pick up bad ideas from newspapers and television, but we are not blind receptors of propaganda- we have the ability to judge and weigh different arguments and in an open society we have the chance to compete different explanations against each-other.

He then goes on to talk about 'everyday racism'.

&gt;Eight days after it was installed, Incedal was recorded discussing plans to purchase a firearm. He told Rarmoul-Bouhadjar to keep in touch when purchasing the weapon: “Update me at every stage and just say the sausage is nice, erm, there’s enough sauce in it.” Rarmoul-Bouhadjar asked: “What’s the sausage?” Incedal replied: “Bullets. If there’s not enough sauce in it, you’ll have to make that decision if we’re going to take it or not.”

&gt;The two men were arrested and were found to be in possession of almost-identical SD memory cards wrapped in masking tape and concealed inside their iPhone cases. Stored on each of the cards were a number of documents concerning explosives, including the five-page bomb-making manual.

&gt;The examination also showed that Incedal had been communicating with another person, thought to be in the Middle East, who was using an email account in the name of Zaynab Alawi. The pair exchanged a number of messages referring to “straps” – slang for firearms. One exchange referred to “k 1122aaa shhh etc”, which the prosecution suggested was a code for Kalashnikovs, and “mo88m ssbayy style”, said to be a reference to an attack on a hotel, such as that carried out in Mumbai in November 2008.

It follows that as investments ""go up as well as down"", as every financial product ad says, so therefore home owners should take the rough with the smooth.

The only reason I bring this verse is up is because it says on the second last line 'nor thieves.....shall inherit the Kingdom Heaven'.

You could very well say that about him or someone, but then again, you'd effectively be engaging in a similar appearance of xenophobia, so I don't think that would be productive. 

The point, as I see it, is that it will obviously lend itself to being offensive on some level, and to being *seemingly* hateful, rather than necessarily actually hateful, regardless of what he says - though I agree 'hate' is probably a tad strong a word. People, typically SNP supporters, tend to pounce on this as if it were some kind of blasphemy when really it's not too unlike any other sort of reaction to any other political personality, party or issue.

No doubt he's been asked, it's clearly on the minds of the public, but he's a politician! What do you expect him to say, regardless of what he may or may not feel?

His report, which considered alternatives such as a secret ballot, was finished last year.

The government (now-leader of the House, William Hague MP) then decided it would bring forward the report, in which it was recommended that the current system of Speaker elections remain in place (to prevent party whips being able to control and manipulate the vote disproportionately, and to stop parties electing Speakers from their own party, who might be more favourable to them, through the whip system). However, they then forced through a vote on the exact opposite of Walker's report's recommendations: bringing in a secret ballot for Speaker elections.

In so doing, they hoped to oust John Bercow (hence his 'I'm not going anywhere' comment) and replace him with Lindsay Hoyle, who they presumably prefer - the talk being that Tories aren't happy with Bercow not letting them talk at length and interrupting the Prime Minister.

Walker wasn't told about this move even when meeting the Leader and Deputy Leader of the House yesterday evening. Instead as the Tories all got together at 10.30am in the House for a briefing in which they were compelled to vote yes on the motion for the change in procedure, and he was rightly incensed, as you see in the video.

The vote was defeated, thankfully.

tl;dr The Tories tried to ram through a procedural motion on the last day of Parliament to make Speaker elections less accountable in the wake of the publication of Walker's report, which was completely opposed to Walker's conclusions, and demanded that Walker, among others, vote yes on the reform.",null,0,null,1427382226,null,0,false,0,cprew0q,null,t3_30dbfh,null,t1_cprew0q,null,t1_cpre7tk,null,null,null,1432025686,null,145,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,145,null

null,false,insoundfromwayout,null,null,null,"Well he was saying that you can potentially be released from prison if found innocent, but cannot be reanimated if found innocent after your execution. So one case is obviously more severe a punishment than the other. 

To stay with the previous analogy: in one case the missing money can be potentially returned, in the other case it cannot. Thus they should be considered different cases.

There is definitely a principled difference between prison and execution.

In one case we say ""Look, as a society we have got together, and we are very very sure that you have killed this child. We had experts look at it the case, investigators investigate it, we have special labs to test blood and DNA, we had lawyers argue for and against you, trained judges to judge it, and we are very sure you are guilty, and so we are going to exclude you from society as a punishment and to keep you from committing any further similar crimes. However, because we are human, and therefore fallible, we are open to the possibility that we might be wrong about this, and we realise that if we ARE wrong about this, we would be committing a terrible wrong against you, on the same sort of level as the crimes we think you have committed. So, in reverence of that principle that no innocent man deserves this treatment, we have decided to imprison you rather than execute you, for in the unlikely case that we are found to have been mistaken, we can at least in part release and compensate you.""

It is a principled difference, because it's saying that society holds so dear the principle that it is wrong for an innocent man to be subject to punishment, that, knowing judicial infallibility is impossible, it limits itself in the severity of punishments it can give out, so as to exclude the punishments that cannot be rescinded (e.g. execution, dismemberment, branding, etc).",null,0,null,1427382533,null,0,false,0,cprf2nl,null,t3_30cswb,null,t1_cprf2nl,null,t1_cprafkv,null,null,null,1432025773,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

What makes you say that? The Swansea and Man Utd games? Because neither of those sides played any special system to shut us down. They just did what they'd been doing already, and they're tactically good sides.

&gt;I think we should have more faith with our defenders in a back 4

Why? We had to change to a back 3 to stop embarrassing ourselves in the first half of the season.

 &gt;especially with this reborn migs

Which is only a thing because of the back 3. He now understands and trusts a system. If it ain't broke, don't fix it

&gt;Fullback is still a worry, although if Can plays RB we should be fine there.

So this preposed system requires pushing Emre Can into a more uncomfortable position. I'll assume Moreno, who was poor in a standard back for will also be playing LB.

&gt;We need more players in attacking positions, we're not scoring enough

And the diamond fixes that? It has 2 ST and 1 AM, the current set up has 1 ST and 2 AM.

&gt; if a back 4 means we start conceding 1-2 a game but we start scoring 3-4 a game then that's fine.

Yeah it's fine, but it also barely makes a difference. We've been won plenty of games 2-0, all 4-2 gets is higher goals scored which is a low down the table of things to be judged on.

Also, where's the guarantee we'll actually start scoring 3-4 with this group of players? Suarez scored or created 42(?) goals last season, and that was alongside form Sturridge. Neither Sterling nor Balotelli will partner still returning to full fitness Sturridge to the same effect.

No I don't. I'm not talking about the improvements in technology, but the way in which it is used these days. 

Consider the Jamie Bulger murder. As memory serves, catching and prosecuting the killers in that case was entirely down to 'traditional' police investigations. They identified the boys responsible using CCTV and eyewitness accounts, and the conviction rested on forensic evidence. Wikipedia gives some insight into the police work behind it:


&gt; Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with ""two youths"" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV.[30]
&gt; 
&gt; Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body. Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests. A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched the features of the upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the toecap of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used ""some force"" when he kicked Bulger.[31]

Now, in that sort of situation, it's totally fair to argue that the '100% certain' point cannot be established. Everything might appear to fit, but it's impossible to be 100%. Mistakes can be made, and there have been enough high-profile cases where the best efforts and faithful prosecutions have proven erroneous. Barry George, the guy originally declared responsible for the murder of Gill Dando, seems one obvious example. Luke Mitchell is arguably another.
 
Skip forward 20 years though, and, again, have a read of the [Dnepropetrovsk Maniac's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnepropetrovsk_maniacs#Arrest_and_trial) case, and tell me where you think there can be holes in the case. Objectively, do you really think there is anything less than a 100% certainty that they were responsible for the murders? Do you think the videos of them killing people were (or could have been) faked, along with a convincing amount the circumstantial and forensic evidence implicating them? 


&gt; I would also argue that the death penalty as a sentence only for crimes when you are 100% certain of guilt, compared to reasonable doubt, wouldn't serve justice. Person A kills one person with 100% certainty so gets the death penalty, person B kill 10 people but only to a ""reasonable doubt"" standard so gets a life sentence, is person A more of a threat or guilty of a more heinous crime than person B?

Again, that's not what I'm discussing. My point's that the ""you can never be 100% certain"" argument is, in this era, just outdated. You're welcome to convince me otherwise.

&gt;Last time I checked the official party website (a couple of months ago) it stated that the Greens were anti-nuclear.

First off I should say that the manifesto in the link is for the Green party on Reddit not the real Green party so there are some differences, like the nuclear power section.

There are some really good (and not anti-science) reasons for being skeptical of nuclear as a solution to energy, like the environmental and social cost of uranium mining, unresolved issues on dealing with waste and the fact it remains an expensive and non-renewable way of generating power. Having said all that, the new influx of membership are a lot more pragmatic about nuclear than some of the older party members and so I think the official line will change at the next conference. Personally I think we need to  keep going with the nuclear we have at least as a stop gap while we find better solutions for storing intermittent renewable energy. 

&gt;Fossil fuels are still required, although I'd consider them more like ""plastic ore"" rather than a fuel.

I can definitely see your point here but plastic manufacture is just not the reason companies are interested in fracking, they want fuel and they are going to burn what they get out. While the finite limit on the amount of petrochemicals is a real concern (there are lots of things we really need plastics for) the bigger concern has to be climate change, based on present predictions we will run out of fossil fuels a long time after we have burned enough to cause irreversible climate change. 

&gt;AIUI fracking is safe if done correctly, so perhaps tighter regulation is what's required?

This may in fact be true but it is very difficult to do correctly. One of the big problems with fracking is the danger of contaminating water courses as [happened last year in California](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-reese-halter/fracking-poisons-californ_b_5986758.html), now as far as I understand it the problem in California was that fracking company had failed to map the network of aquifers around the site adequately. It may be possible to map aquifers more reliably and so avoid this sort of problem again but I believe it is rather a difficult task. 

At any rate, for me the problem with fracking is largely that it is a way of increasing the supply of fossil fuels which decreases the pressure on industry and governments to address climate change now.  

&gt;Will this be on-book public spending, or more PFI-hide-the-numbers-penalise-the-future bullshit?

Our famously fully costed manifesto isn't out yet but the increased spending will almost certainly take the form of more government borrowing. That isn't to say we don't care about the deficit though, the national debt needs addressing but should only be done once the economy has recovered. Using government borrowing to stimulate the economy when it is suffering and repaying when its healthy is sensible fiscal policy, even the IMF has said that Tory austerity slowed our economic recovery.

&gt;Tax avoidance is a non-issue. Tax evasion is what you mean. Unless you are going to tell me that you willingly pay more tax than you are due to pay?

Well both are problems, I think everyone agrees that tax evasion should be dealt with as the crime that it is but the tax system is built in such a way that their are many legal loopholes through which the wealthy avoid paying their fair share. Yes, its legal so they are entitled to do it under the current law but we think that the tax system should be simple and fair so that the rich have to pay back to society.

&gt;Have you considered the possibility of taxing gross income rather than simply profit?

Interesting idea, I'll have to have a think about that.

&gt;I'm cool with private business being in the NHS (after all, we want the NHS to concentrate on health not other duties) 

I think you mean services like cleaning etc? We were talking more about private firms operating elements of the health provision itself really. I can understand the opinion of people who say that the important thing is that healthcare is free at the point of use and if the state can get cheaper, better care from private providers then great. The problem is that the care just won't be better or cheaper in the long run, I work in healthcare and can see many ways that the NHS works to limit cost, we try to avoid unnecessary tests and when we can, we use cheaper drugs, that often work just as well, this will not happen when profit is involved. Private provision will mean more unnecessary tests which can be dangerous and may lead to unnecessary procedures when harmless anomalies are found and the most expensive, newest drugs will be used which again carry more risk to patients.

In terms of things like cleaning I can see your point but think that in house cleaners are more likely to feel part of the team, more likely to feel what they do is an important service and more likely to get treated well and paid right and all of that will give us cleaner hospitals.

&gt;Too late, that's been done.

Ooops! I have to confess, I wrote that section for the Reddit Greens and I'm not massively clued up on the area. I guarantee that there are people in the real party who know the score!

Thanks again for the questions, I hope I answered them, just about. Please ask some more if you like!!

As for Utilitarianism, seems to be another good bits in theory, poor in practical application idea.
My view is that the other main stream parties more successfully identify their potential electorate, and are better at targeting them with the issues that mean the most to them personally. With numbers at the polling stations showing an increasing voter apathy, and with this an apparent shrinking voter pool, is it any surprise that the Labour and Tory parties of the 70's and 80's have evolved into parties that are no longer recognizable as separate entities. They are now  just power seeking sharks fighting over an ever diminishing electoral mackerel pool ( I like Mackerel is the only reason ), with no real beliefs other than to get themselves elected, hence the constant knee jerk reactions to try and stay on the good side of the voters. And with UKIP weighing in now, ( Elections will tell how successfully ) the Green party is just going to end up taking the place of the Liberal/SDP/Libdem vote, always there as a protest vote never as a government.

There's some gender disparity in courses which certainly merits effort in trying to reduce, but, for example, it's quite difficult to recruit girls to do Physics or Engineering degrees at higher than 20% when only 20% of girls actually study Physics at A Level, which suggests the problem lies further down the age scale.

null,false,Cocktorpedo,null,null,null,"Hey, thanks for reading our manifesto! I should point out that this stage that while we are based on the real life GPEW, there are some relevant differences between us and the IRL party (parties, if you count scottish greens). I'll run through your individual comments since ~~/u/whigwham is probably super busy with real life stuff atm :)~~ nvm turns out he's online. Oh well here's my thoughts on it anyway :p

&gt;When did this become a thing? Last time I checked the official party website (a couple of months ago) it stated that the Greens were anti-nuclear. Seems they still are[1] (full manifesto is not yet available).

This is probably the most noticeable difference between us and the IRL Green party - while IRL there is still massive internal debate in the party, our MHOC version is almost entirely, and unashamedly, pro-nuclear. However, it is very important to note that we see nuclear as an important stepping stone between weening the country off fossil fuels and going full renewable - we hope that nuclear is eventually phased out as we go full renewable. But until then, this country needs it.

&gt;Fossil fuels are still required, although I'd consider them more like ""plastic ore"" rather than a fuel. AIUI fracking is safe if done correctly, so perhaps tighter regulation is what's required?

It isn't so much a problem with fracking as a method of extraction (although it certainly does correlate with ground instability); it's more that it feeds our countries obsession with fossil fuels, raising the barriers towards adoption of cleaner fuels (such as nuclear or renewables) by increasing availability. We do not want to encourage the use of fossil fuels any further than they currently are - and with oil prices as low as they are at the moment, i'm sure you can understand that they don't need any further encouragement.

&gt;GMOs could help with the creation of base oils for further production, but it seems the Greens are anti-GMO; so how do you square that particular circle?

The MHOC Green Party supports the use of GMOs, as we believe they are an important and safe method of increasing crop yields and farming efficiency. The biggest problems with GMOs (namely loss of diversity and predatory business practises, *monsanto*) can be overcome simply by there being more firms willing to sell genetically modified seeds, as well as tight regulation to make sure any potential damage to the environment, or to crop biodiversity, is minimal.

&gt;Will this be on-book public spending, or more PFI-hide-the-numbers-penalise-the-future bullshit?

This will involve government backed stimulus packages to stimulate growth - so no to PFIs, which we believe are extremely damaging to the NHS.

&gt;Yup. Always puzzled me how we can grow ad infinitum. OK, technology does help (being able to to more with less) but panicking because the economy didn't grow seems pointless, so long as the standard of living improves; who gives a shit?

As a broad left party, we have a wide range of opinions on capitalism - the 'infinite growth' part is certainly a common criticism. Outside of future colonisation of other planets, we are going to have to work with what we have - and we can all agree that pure capitalism is not best suited to sustainable growth.

&gt;Like back-in-the-day when workers used to own shares in the mill? It's a good idea, but at times hard-nosed decisions still have to be made. Probably better that it's done by the workers themselves than aloof executives.

I'm glad you agree :)

&gt;Tax avoidance is a non-issue. Tax evasion is what you mean. Unless you are going to tell me that you willingly pay more tax than you are due to pay?

We are committed to reducing both, as both are costing us [billions](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/74789000/gif/_74789048_tax_avoidance_evasion_464.gif). We will reduce tax avoidance through legislation, and crack down on evasion through legal means if necessary. In an ideal world, people should willingly pay their fair share to a society which has helped them to get them where they are today.

&gt;I'm cool with private business being in the NHS (after all, we want the NHS to concentrate on health not other duties) and see no issue with them hiring in outsiders for particular services/supplies etc. I am not cool with the NHS being forced into using private companies when they could do it themselves faster/better/cheaper. I would love to know how you will break the PFI stranglehold - renege on contracts? (FYI, I am opposed to PFI).

In the Green headed 3rd government, we (with the Lib Dems and Labour) passed a bill which [took ownership of all PFI debts within the NHS](http://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2ze5mu/b093_health_and_social_care_reform_bill/).

Secondly, of death penalty opponents, a few of them consider the issue of high enough moral importance that they would never vote for a death penalty supporter. For proponents, there doesn't seem to be a moral impetus to kill someone you could merely jail forever, so there's very few votes in supporting capital punishment. That's likely country-specific, in that there are notorious instances of capital punishment being used in the US as a vote-winning tool (Willie Horton, for instance).

I've heard the exact same argument for why women's lives are difficult. When they get into a lift with a man it is awful for them because they have a constant fear that they'll get raped. The backup for that claim is rape statistics and how men are likely to sexually assault women. 

If I'm walking alone at night down a street and there is a woman just in front of me. I feel a little nervous and want a way I can express I'm not going to hurt anyone. I don't think that makes me a victim. We're working against thousands of years of culture, biases and ideas. Everyone will always have to fight against the box other people put them in.

With that said I'm not trying to make out I need a public interest group. There are definitely attitudes towards gender, sex and race that society needs to address. 

If this video was a white man talking about prison statistics and how he is more likely to be labelled the aggressor in any news story where a female is involved then I'm not sure what the reception would be. I hope my point isn't lost in my ramblings.

The US budget deficit went from 10.4% in 2010 to 4.1% in 2013. They have cut just as hard as we did, if not harder. Though they are have been applying more stimulus since, but that's irrelevant.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States

&gt;There has been no real cutting of the deficit the past 3 years. In fact the only real deficit cut in that time came because the economy started to grow.

The economy growing was always part of the plan (obviously), check the projected figures from 2010. The fact that tax receipts didn't pick up as quickly as anticipated is why the deficit is still 4% now, not because they didn't cut as much as they wanted to.

&gt;Since then we've seen a real revenue neutral with a structural deficit cut.

Please explain what you mean by this.

&gt;Krugman got it pretty spot on. The moment the Tories abandoned real austerity the economy recovered.

In May 2012 Krugman was saying the economy will not pick up until the government completely changed course and started stimulating the economy (check the article I linked). It picked up 6 months later, with no stimulus at all. The government did not ""abandon austerity"", spending continued to go down (slightly) against a backdrop of 3% inflation:

&gt; Yes, its legal so they are entitled to do it under the current law but we think that the tax system should be simple and fair so that the rich have to pay back to society.

See, this is where the problem starts. Examine your pay slip. See that pension contribution? It reduces your tax bill. Isn't that ""tax avoidance""? Isn't that a ""good thing""? There's other examples as well, e.g. charitable donations. In the urge to eradicate tax evasion, don't throw out the baby with bath water and end up punishing the poor by actually raising the tax they pay.

Tax avoidance is often just careful planning (your and I can easily do it), tax evasion (e.g. creating artificial loan structures, or paying massive royalties overseas etc) is quite another. Telling one from the other can be tricky at times; hence ""tax the gross"", although that may be regressive in some cases I guess.

&gt; Interesting idea, I'll have to have a think about that.

Many young LGBT *do* suffer from internalised homophobia. the OP of this post admitted he suffered with it for a long time. I suffered with it until I was about 23. I'm still 23. It's actually a rather common issue which causes a lot of other issues, but people seem to think gay people come out at 18 and then their life time of hating themselves and thinking they're an un-natural freak of nature who shouldn't exist and being terrified of being rejected for being gay just melts away the next morning. But I anticapte being downvoted because I don't say what people like to hear, and told by heterosexuals who have no idea what they're talking about why I'm wrong. 

You know when gay people come out and are terrrified of being rejected now that people *know* they're gay, they tend to say and do everything people like to remedy that fear of being rejected. They suck up big time. I did it for years and years. That's why gay people always have the same opinion as you like ""Gay pride sucks"" or ""flamboyany gay people are annoying"" and never have any diverse opinions and just parrot the majority opinion. 

If this was 3 years ago, I wouldn't be replying with this. I would be replying with ""LOL totally, internalised homophobia so stupid. Stupid SJWs!!! You're so right. I agree. You're hilarious. I love you. I don't have internalised homophobia, no siree. It's a myth. People are just jealous they're not as masculine as me"". That's what I would be saying. Because I had internalised homophobia and said everything people like to hear to remedy my perpetual fear of being rejected by them for being the ""Bad Gay Guy"" and was a big fat suck up. You just have no idea 

You have no idea how many LGBT people deny they have internalised homophobia to avoid looking vulnerable or weak. I was one of them :\ But because they say what you like to hear, you don't mind. It's not interanlised homophobia. It's just ""common sense"". And anybody who dares suggest they have some issues is just a SJW. Even though they used to *be* that person and see themselves reflected in them. But no, I'm just a stupid SJW who is jealous of masculine guys or whatever.

It's hard enough getting LGBT people to open up about their buried issues without having people downplay it and validate them just because they say what they like to hear, but bring on the down votes for not parroting what you want to hear and sucking on your arse hole 

EDIT: i'm sorry for going off like this now, I didn't keep my cool which I should have. I was too blunt. I just went through internalised homophobia and kissed ass for so long and it fucked me up so now when I see people downplaying it or validating it it bugs me because I used to *be* that person and I used to say what they say and think what they think and ughhhhhhhhh",null,0,null,1427386973,null,0,1427391099,0,cprhwof,null,t3_30cvxr,null,t1_cprhwof,null,t1_cprduxa,null,null,null,1432027178,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

I would treat those surveys with a pinch of salt, by the way. Assuming that gay people aren't massively skewing the statistics, you'd expect the average number of partners for men and women to be the same. The fact that they're different suggests that men are exaggerating their number of partners and that women are playing it down. That's fairly consistent with societal pressure too.

**Maths ahead:**

Having said that, I don't know what their methodology is. With that in mind, there is another possible explanation for the disparity between men and women, but I still think Occam's razor favours men overestimating the number and women underestimating it. Assuming the effect of gay people is negligible, the [mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean#Definition) number of partners must be equal for men and women. However, if they're using the [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean#Contrast_with_median) instead, it's possible for a small group of very promiscuous women to skew things so that men end up with a higher number of sexual partners on average.",null,0,null,1427387692,null,0,false,0,cprie38,null,t3_30bb0z,null,t1_cprie38,null,t1_cprhd1v,null,null,null,1432027406,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Why do I say this, other than regional pride?  
Newcastle Airport is north-west of the city - so it's about 45 miles to Darlington.  
To do this by public transport will involve getting the metro (local light-rail network) into Newcastle then the train from there back down to Darlington. This will probably take about 90 minutes and cost around £20 each in total.  
I'm assuming you'd be flying directly into Newcastle with KLM? If not you also need to account for getting to airports in London - you can only get to Newcastle from Heathrow (BA) or Gatwick (EasyJet), so if you were planning on getting the train to London you'll still have to account for the transfer.


I normally fly to Newcastle from Heathrow (I live about 7 miles from Newcastle airport), but as Darlington is on the east-cost mainline and many of the trains stop there, it'll probably be much cheaper and easier by rail.  
Take a look at trainline.com - I book most of my tickets through them. Picking a random date of May 14th you can go Kings Cross -&gt; Darlington at 21:00 for £28 and at 22:00 (arriving at 1:30am...) for £16.30  
It's often cheaper to book two singles than a return...

I would argue that majority of people in the country and political parties all agree with the 4 positions outlined in the wiki article. 

Mixed economy: there are very few or no political parties or people that want total privatisation or total nationalisation.

Social security: no political party or people are suggesting we entirely get rid of all social security (pensions?).

Market regulation: no one is suggesting removing child labour laws.

Progressive taxation: everyone would agree that there has to be some kind of progression. 

Every slightly mainstream political party includes these 4 different policies, just to varying degrees.

&gt;This was defined in a court order handed down by Nicol as “a meeting that takes place in a room in which the door is closed and it is clear that no one can overhear from outside the room what is being said during the meeting”. The order further stipulated that “mobile phones must be switched off and any telephone landlines must not be connected [ie the line open] to any internal or external other telephone. No part of the meeting can be recorded and no notes made.”

&gt;A proposal that the order should also decree that the door to the meeting room should be locked, and that there should be no CCTV in the vicinity, was dropped.

&gt;I told him to say nothing and to hope none of his colleagues in the motoring press let him down. Happily they did not.

What he describes as Producer Choice was something that could be photographed and which the producer felt he could be, ""hung out to dry"" for endorsing. That sounds awfully like Clarkson reported himself to his producer for assaulting someone and was let off with it.

2013 inflation was 2.5% for the year, meaning the budget for 14/15 should have been £731 billion just to match inflation, which it was.

2014 inflation was 1.5% for the year, meaning the budget for 15/16 should have been £742 billion to match inflation. It was actually a few billion higher, mainly because the Tories have decided on a pre-election giveaway!

None of this of course has any basis on the years I'm referring to, which is 2012+2013. In 2011 inflation was 4.5%, so the 2012 budget should have been 4.5% higher than 2011 to be flat. Was it? Same question again with the 2.8% inflation in 2012 vs the 2013 budget.

null,false,CD17,null,null,null,"Hey, good choice of city! I had a couple Canadians living with me at the end of last year, so I'll try and answer this based on what I picked up from their experiences.

1. Housing - I assume you'll want to rent to start with rather than buy? In either case, the big two housing aggregators are [Zoopla](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/) and [Rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/). Either will be fine for finding a place, although Edinburgh can be a bit of a nightmare to find somewhere at first.

2. Health care - You will be covered by the NHS for emergency treatments, but you won't be able to register with a doctor until you have proof of a job in the country. [This site](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68) should give you a bit more information on this.

3. Tax - You'll pay income tax and national insurance via PAYE as any other employee. It will be different if you're self-employed, but I don't know anything about that (sorry!).

4. Jobs - [indeed](http://www.indeed.co.uk/) is probably the best bet. Gumtree CAN be useful, but in my experience it's more useful for under-the-table odd jobs than a steady salaried position. YMMV. You can also check out [s1 jobs](http://www.s1jobs.com/jobs/edinburgh/find) and [reed](http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/edinburgh).

5. Culture - well, this is a broad question! Edinburgh is a very open, friendly and multi-cultural city. I just took a look around my office (didn't even get out of my chair) and I counted 7 different nationalities. I seriously doubt you'll have any issues with cultural acceptance. Most issues that arise are people moving here without being able to speak English - this obviously doesn't apply to you.

Question: Do you think the QE money will ever be taken back out of the system? Or do you consider it to be part of the permanent money supply? I ask because the official line is that it will be rolled back, but your stance implies it is permanent. Hence, from my current understanding of your argument, while I don't necessarily disagree, that's not how the BoE and UK gov are presenting the situation.

Addendum:

(*) - You also need the economy to grow indefinitely of course, and that's a sensitive subject (see the end-of-growth crowd), but putting that aside, we know that growth comes in cycles, so one goal is to ensure we enter the next down-cycle with a manageable debt level so that we don't have to go through these difficult austerity 'phases', which historically have triggered revolutions and wars.

I think it's unlikely they'd accept a bid in the other case, though. If Roma is resigned to losing Pjanic, they only stand to benefit by having a bid from Liverpool come in and it be leaked to the press, alerting other clubs that they are listening and interested. I think entertaining a bid from Liverpool will also open the transfer to other clubs that could drive up the price who may not be sure they can make the deal work.

Why is survivability important? Surely usefulness is more important - despite forced learning of the old Welsh language for all primary school children for decades and many millions of public money the number of fluent speakers using old Welsh to communicate is falling, the number of fluent speakers is falling. All it's doing now is buoying the Welsh Class and providing an interesting view on historic literature.

Of course Welsh and Cornish people already share a common tongue, English. I imagine the uptake of which amongst Breton peoples is higher than their historic tongue too? France has apparently 25 Million English speakers to maybe 250 thousand Breton speakers so it doesn't appear entirely fanciful.

I thought Breton wasn't mutually comprehensible with Welsh / Cornish and that there was quite a lot of drift between those two as well - but I've not studied that position, just what I've heard.

Ofcom realised in the run-up to 4G that it was going to be very expensive for the five, as it was at the time, mobile network operators to pay for a national upgrade and meet the obligations in their operating license.

Vodafone snapped up the disastrously managed Cable &amp; Wireless, and got their national fibre network.

Orange and T-Mobile merged first, and still haven't really integrated their networks together properly - they were desperate to get into 4G-land first to win as much customer inertia while they ruled the market.

And now there's a reverse (in market share) take-over of O2 by Three. I'd put money on Telifonica buying out Three, but it makes sense when you think O2's 2G network is soon to be retired - so it's strongest asset isn't worth all that much as time goes on.

They would only have to care about 51% of the population. That is an unfair system as 49% of people won't have their opinions put across in terms of the head honcho. 

We'd then need an entrenched constitution which while it can ensure people's rights, however, this stops pragmatism when it is needed. 

If we take America for example right now, the whole political system is at odds, you have a democrat president and republican upper+lower chamber. So in reality, nothing can be achieved unless its of utmost necessity. 

With our Monarchy, it has transformed into a weird sort of paradox, where they don't have any accountability, but they do. They have to show themselves as being for all the people in Britain, whatever their political view's are or the people will turn on them.

This is a great system, since it gives the people a fall back plan if anything goes wrong in our current system. I.e. no government being able to form.

I also take the view that our best foreign ambassadors are the Monarchs. They go abroad to unite, to celebrate and to heal wounds, which I do not think a foreign secretary could do, as they have to tow the party line whatever happens.

Queens visit to Ireland is the best example I can think of in helping to heal wounds between the two nations. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8515165/Queens-visit-to-Ireland-extraordinary-moment-in-history.html

&gt; the monarch does have power that we don't know about. Surely that should worry people.

So do big businesses, unions etc. That's unfortunately how lobbying works. What Charles did was a stupid thing, but we should put it into perspective of the current political system.

No democracy is perfect, Constitutional Monarchy or a Republic. That't just how it is. We could go for a republic but that only opens up a new can of worms for the British people to deal with.

&gt;__""Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay""__ is a [vaudeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville) and [music hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) song. The song's first known public performance was in Henry J. Sayers' 1891 revue *[Tuxedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxedo_(vaudeville\))*, which was performed in Boston, Massachusetts. The song became widely known in the version sung by [Lottie Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottie_Collins) in London [music halls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) in 1892.  The tune was later used in various contexts, including as the theme song to the television show *[Howdy Doody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody)*.

null,false,SDSSJ102915172927,null,null,null,"&gt; Yes, unfortunately the ""fuck gay pride and effeminate men"" crowd does exist, but that doesn't mean that those who don't fit the stereotypes are suffering from the same issues. and accusing them of doing so has nothing to do with internalised homophobia and everything to do with shutting out opposing arguments.

Look, don't get me wrong. I totally agree with this. Remember, I don't fit the stereotype myself. I am not an effeminate gay man. I am ""straight acting"" too okay. I'm not some jealous queen like the guys in gaybros always accuse me of anytime I bring up stuff like this. I constantly get accused of being a ""jealous queen"" for having different views and people try to shut me down by accusing me of being a jealous queen, so I get the same treatment from people that you are talking about. 

But what you need to understand is when I say to another ""straight acting"" man he may have internalised homophobia, it's not because I simply disagree with his views and can't handle other gay people having views different to me and want to ""shut down opposing arguments"". I don't give a crap about that. It's because I used to *have* those views. I used to *be* that person. I used to say what they say and think what they think. It's because I've been there and got the t-shirt. And when people called out *my* internalised homophbobia, I denied it too! So it's not because I don't like gay people having views different to mine. It's because I used to *have* those views myself. That's the difference. 

The problem, is it's extremely difficult to tell the difference between a gay man who says he hates flamboyant gay men and it's his organic opinion, or whether he's only parroting the majority opinion to suck up. Remember, I used to *be* that person. And because getting LGBT people to admit they still have issues, and getting them to look vulnerable or weak like that is extremely difficult. Like I said, I would deny it too. So it's hard. Because you *see* your old self reflected in that person, and you know why they are saying it. But it's impossible to tell whether they genuinely believe that because it's their opinion or whether they are still trapped in the stockholm syndrome virtually all young gay people go through. 

That's the problem. Yes, not all men who don't fit the stereotype and parrot the majority opinion like ""gay pride sucks"" or ""i hate feminine men"" have issues. But all men who have issues usually don't fit the stereotype and parrot the majority opinion. So it's nearly impossible to tell who has buried issues they're refusing to acknowledge, and who is organic. See what I mean? 

And because I used to deny it too, even that's not enough to convince me if I see my old self reflected in someone. I understand how annoying it can be to have your POV disrespected and be accused of having issues you don't have. Because I get the same treatment being accused of being a jealous queen because people disagree with me when I'm not. So I appreciate that for sure. But the fact is, many of those people *do* have issues. But because nobody ever admits it, you don't know how to help them, and you don't know how to trust them. It's like stockholm syndrome in that way. 

But like I said, people have the mistaken impression gay people come out and all of their troubles melt away the next day. No. It takes years or even decades to *truly* come out of the closet in that sense. When you come out it's just a half way house. It doesn't actually cure your internalised issues. Only education and experience does that. 

It was only once I had secured good friendships and educated myself on the studies of homosexuality and slowly scraped together some self esteem as I grew up did I truly escape my internalised homophobia and stockholm syndrome. And that was FIVE years after coming out of the closet as a ""confident, happy gay man"". I never once admitted I still had issues after coming out. Think about that. 

If anything coming out makes some things even worse because people *know* you are gay now, so they have a reason to reject you. Once people *know* you're gay, you fall into the trap of saying and doing everything people want to remedy the fear of being rejected for being gay. Because when you're in the closet you don't have to worry about being rejected for being gay. But when you come out you do. People never seem to appreciate this. 

Coming out doesn't solve your problems, and many gay men will hang onto internalised issues without ever admitting it for the rest of their life, or live in constant fear of being rejected for being gay and kiss ass constantly to remedy that fear and never say or do *anything* which might give people a reason to reject them and parrot everything they say and do like stockholm syndrome, and then homophobes use this vile stockholm syndrome or self loathing to justify their homophobic opinions because ""My gay friend hates gay people too"". Or they feel being gay compromises their masculinity, so over-compensate for that and suppress any feminine or ""stereotypical"" qualities they might have and bash on fem guys, but deny they are insecure in their masculinity because they obviously want to look tough 

You just can't expect a person who's been brainwashed into homophobia his whole life, and then spent several years denying his identity and hating himself and internalising all the harmful myths we constantly hear propagated like ""being gay is against evolution"" or ""I don't mind gay people just don't be TOO gay"" without ANY alternative narrative or education because of Section 28 legislation, to come out and then have all of those problems just melt away in like a month or a year. Doesn't work like that. 

You don't spend 18 years in a closet and then just get over that in a week or two. Nor does a heterosexual spend 18 years being homophobic and just get over that in a week or two. If you don't make the effort to educate yourself on the studies into homosexuality and undo all the crap you've internalised from day 1 and replace the prejducied myths and assumptions with ACTUAL knowledge, you will never get over homophobia. Whether you're heterosexual OR homosexual. It's too powerful and too ingrained. From birth. 

It's extremeley difficult to crawl out of that pit when you've been in it from day 1, ESPECIALLY in this country with Section 28. And if you don't make the effort to educate yourself and undo the damage caused by Section 28, you'll never get over it. You'll just bury it in the back of your mind. But it will always be there and it will seep into everything you do. And people like me who have been there and got the t-shirt will spot it a mile away, no matter how hard you try to conceal it.

null,false,insoundfromwayout,null,null,null,"Well, that wasn't the point - the motion was arguing that the fact women have to pay for sanitary products at all is a type of sexist tax on their wombs. I was making the counterpoint that, if you want to see things that way, the fact men have to buy razors is a similar sexist tax on their beards. Neither was a point on the actual government tax rate, since the word 'tax' was being used more figuratively here.

However, I googled 'razor tax' it earlier actually when someone else brought it up, and it's pretty interesting.

If you google 'razor tax uk' or whatever, you get thousands of results, from major people, well known newspapers and blogs etc, all talking about this one issue: the tax on sanitary pads and tampons. Which is weird, because that's not immediately anything to do with razors or tax. They are all using the same line ""tampons are taxed, while men's razors are tax free"". 

It's mentioned [here in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/11/free-tampons-cost-feminine-hygiene-products)  
Here in the [Huffington post](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ellie-slee/the-bloody-cheek-of-the-tampon-tax_b_5363720.html)  
On a shitload of small feminist blogs  
EVEN on a [early day motion](http://www.edms.org.uk/2014-15/866.htm) by an MP, Charlotte Leslie

But no one ever gives any proper sources.

[One article](http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/17/poll-should-women-have-to-pay-tax-on-tampons-5066401/) mentioned 'a petition' claimed it. 
&gt;The petition Highlights a host of items which are currently exempt including ‘crocodile meat’, ‘edible sugar flowers’ and ‘alcoholic jellies’ (cold sandwiches, men’s razors and nuts also boast a zero per cent tax rate).

So I went to [the petition](https://www.change.org/p/george-osborne-stop-taxing-periods-period), which refers to [a list](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/things-you-dont-have-to-pay-vat-on-that-arent-tampons--eySqxP5uzg) - but the list doesn't mention anything about razors.

You can go to the gov.uk site and see the actual list of things that have reduced rate VAT on them [here](https://www.gov.uk/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services). And as far as I can make out, razors are not on the list anywhere. It's a pretty short list anyway, there are only four physical  products under the 'health' category: incontinence products, maternity pads, sanitary protection products, and low vision aids. No razors. And as far as I see there are no other overarching categories that razors would fit in to. 

And I found this article in the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/theres-nothing-luxurious-about-my-periods-so-why-is-the-government-taxing-tampons-as-if-there-is-10045629.html) which finished with a correction: 
&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that men's razors were tax-fee. However, they are not listed on the Government's list of tax exempt items, and the article has been updated to reflect this. 

So it looks like it is just a really, really, really widespread myth that lots of people have parroted without checking. 

I'm open to the possibility that I am wrong, if anyone can find anything solid that says otherwise, I'm not a tax lawyer and have only googled it a couple of times and not much more. But as far as I can find from actual government sources there is nothing to suggest that razors are taxed at anything other than the standard rate of 20%. So it is quite interesting that it gets said so much.",null,0,null,1427391747,null,0,false,0,cprl3hk,null,t3_308jwn,null,t1_cprl3hk,null,t1_cprjumq,null,null,null,1432028681,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I still think they were right to fire Clarkson, and I've lost a lot of respect for him as a person since the ""slope"" and the ""n-word"" nursery rhyme debacles, BUT yes - what about the whole team of tv writers, directors, producers and editors that have WATCHED the jokes the presenters make, condoned them, cut them into the show and then allowed them to air? classic case of this was the Hammond and Mexico controversy. obviously a joke that went terribly wrong, but he was the ONLY one who got the flack for it, and frankly, everyone involved in getting that to air (along with the slope comment), should've been - I dunno, reprimanded or something. 

Although it is entirely possible that Clarkson DID script the racist-ish things he said. He and Andy Wilman, as I understand it, are the driving creative forces behind the new Top Gear; Clarkson writes for it and helps produce it. But yes - I'm not sure that Top Gear isn't populated by vaguely racist-ish editors.

Frankie Boyle has said some outrageous things, and Richard Osman, in the full video, actually states that he thinks that some of the things he said were indefensible/inappropriate, so he, as a producer, is obviously of a different opinion than Boyle.

The number of speakers is on the **increase** and more young people are taking an interest in it. The complete fluency is overall dropping but numbers of speakers are increasing, just check the Assembly website for statistics. The way Welsh is taught in schools is not great but is getting better. The amount of money spent on Welsh teaching is minuscule in the grand scheme of things.

A big problem is that divided the Celtic languages are weak, in Brittany the French government has been pro-active in trying to lessen the numbers of speakers, seeing it as a threat to their legitimacy. Despite this Breton is still taught in most schools there and is used in daily life. The vast majority of English speakers in France are in the cities. Barely any English is known in the countryside.

What you've heard about Breton is correct, but exaggerated. It has drifted due to having France as a neighbour compared with England but is still close to the others, it's the accent that makes it sound incomprehensible more than anything :P

He is doing good for the UK scene, maybe on a minuscule level, but it does prove that we're here and can in fact produce something. Even if it isn't a player, producing a caster is just as good. 

Comparing IHL/your little UK Dota social group to being what the UK scene is then you're so wrong. Your ego gets the best of you sometimes, you think you know what's best when in fact, you really don't. It's your opinion vs quite a few thousand. I'm not saying Reddits decision on what's good/what isn't is true (in fact it usually isn't) but when you've got 4-5 well known professional players (who usually slag off casters) tweet and post about how they're actually impressed by a caster then i think that's saying something.

I won't disagree, his knowledge isn't as good as the people he's co-casted recently = with, but that's why he has a co-caster OD follows the play and usually the co-caster (who in my opinion, can't keep up with casting, but has the knowledge and notices the little but important thing) satisfies the audience need for why things are happening.

Matt Childs leaving was a big shock and big loss to the club.


Redfearn's been asked to start prep for preseason and such, so signs indicate he'll be here next year. Needs to be sorted sooner rather than later.


**What changed re: our form?** Diamond ran it's course, tried the 4231 against sunderland, not necessarily with the personnel intended to be used, and it came good. 

**On Adryan, what's going on?** Talented, lovely lad, but may have lost his way. Still young, like any of the other younger players, may or may not be here next season and that might make it tougher for him (Popey asks: no place for showhorse?) Yeah, we needed players who could put a shift in and get stuck in etc.

**Best young player?** *(Popey - mine has to be cook)* Yeah, he looks like any other scholar but then you realise he might be the best player here! Lovely lad, great setup for the scholars because there are genuine people in the system who care, Lucy Ward almost like a mother.

**Cellino and contracts:** Will Cellino be back? Contracts for young players? There's been noise made, Cellino loves the youth look at what he did at Cagliari, lots of youth brought through etc. Just have to wait.

**Kids ready for a tilt at Championship?** Starting vs Bolton with Cook and Mowatt and met with strange looks, he knew they were better, knew them very well, no fear cus that's how they were brought up. The more youth he added the more vibrant the team got. He also thought if he ever got the job he would always have fancied doing the team this way.

**Chris Dawson, where does he stand?** Shoulder injured, no op but he's done well. From where we are need to be careful of how many we blood at the same time. Chris Dawson will be a big part of Leeds for years to come but Redders needs to be mindful of not blooding too many at the same time and risking unbalancing the squad.

**Couple more debuts for youth before end of season?** Yes, but it needs to be a proper opportunity, doesn't matter when it comes, they'll be here for years if things go to plan so no rush.

(Stream died here, so missed a bit)

Players need to know when you're not happy, need to know standard and when not to drop eg the Fulham game, we were riding our luck and the players needed a bollocking. Thommo balances him but knows when he's not happy. half time talk has to be well managed, only 15 mins which fly by and hard to influence during the game.

**Relationship with Cellino:** Not party to Hockaday and Milanic's relationships with him, but needs honesty, he can't just give the answers he wants to hear, sometimes he likes it, sometimes he doesn't but need to be heard. Always wants to talk about football, helpful and understanding. After losing 4-1 to Ipswich, 'you won't win every game, you need to be human' 4-1 a walloping but need to move on. Will sometimes offer advice eg 'need to look this', which is helpful.

**Doing the retain list:** *(Popey: what if you say don't want him, not good enough etc, and it clashes with those who recruited?)* Has to be honest, not fair to the player to beat around the bush, need to be clear. might not like it, but need to build for the future, no room for deadwood.

**Antenucci spitting his dummy out, how do you handle that?** Get on with it, what's important is if they perform consistently they can get in the team and everyone buys into that.

**Hero growing up?** Used to sit in the East stand, can look up and see where used to sit from the dugout, very strange. At a time when we were winning everything, had to be Allen Clarke. Used to pretend to be him when he played.

**Out of contract players eg Aidy White:** No real news, the shift to playing wide would have suited him very well, on his road back may get a little bit of training in before the end of the season. Decisions need to be made.

**You had targets in Jan, are they still available?** Yeah, a few are but I'm part of a process, if they think it viable they'll go for it, if not we'll go through that.

**Benedicic and other youth?** Massimo misjudged the Championship, which he's admitted, the tempo, the strength, some technical, very good standard and difficult to play in. You need very specific players, just looks at Fulham. Takes a certain sort of personnel and exp to get out. They've integrated well and are part of a team. But no decisions made re their future.

**Of all the players who's come on the best?** Can't really single anyone out. As a group bought in very well, stuff throughout the week is generic, through the core of passing etc. towards the end of the week focus on the championship, how to beat a team like Blackburn while retaining our identity. Play our philosophy but be practical

**Improvements?** Defence solid, Midfield phenomenal, need extra dimension up top. Genuine attacking width needed, at the club we have Walters who can play there, so can Aidy but no pure wingers. Look at bournemouth, 2 wingers start, then 2 can come off the bench. 

**The option of returning to Academy, would you do it now, or is this your level now?** Get immersed in whatever he does, no matter the role enjoying the step up and feels he owes a duty to the players he has brought through. Doesn't want to pigeonhole himself, wants to have multiple facets. Not saying he doesn't want to manage, he wants to see this through and make it the best it can be. 

**Someone will come for you if it doesn't work out:** I'm aware of that, the best times I had as a player was Barnsley, not interested in anything else despite interest every year. Just enjoy yourself and not derail yourself. Enjoy working with other people and strive to improve. The decision may be taken out of his hands where he needs to look for a new club but he doesn't want to.

**Club is as good as it's been for 10 years, do you sense we can go far?** I do, I've seen how clubs are put together, where clubs are poor and they improve, might take some time, quick fixes are difficult but it's something we're working towards.

We need someone to sit next to Fernandinho who can pass and has a massive defensive work rate as well. That's the only way the 4-2-2-2 will work IMO is with two defensively very strong midfielders. That's why I think Pogba is actually not the ideal player for us that everyone talks of - he's a great Yaya replacement, but that's not what we need. Just like Yaya, Pogba's attacking brilliance would be lovely to watch, but his defensive lapses would hurt us in the big games, just like they do with Yaya. 

 We would be much better served with someone like Verratti, Schneiderlin, Nainggolan, Witsel - basically we need someone like Carrick, though hopefully better. He needs to be able to pass the ball well and start attacks, but stay focused on defending when the 2 fullbacks are right up the pitch. 

If we can get a player like that then Fernando may come into his own as a partner to that player and challenge Dinho for a starting place - but they'll never start together.

One day I was feeling particularly generous, so after suspending the father from a skylight, I asked the kid to sing ""ah vous dirai-je, maman"" to the tune of the alphabet song, but unfortunately I'd already begun exacting my revenge on the father for poorly educating his five-year-old before the child could explain that some people sing it differently. So you see, that one fateful night just outside Horsham has kind of stuck in my mind.

Either that, or children seem to be immensely proud of themselves when they can *nearly* sing the whole alphabet, and take great delight in singing to every family member or friend of the family who comes to visit.

Yawn. Which is exactly what normal people are referring to when talking about ""the deficit"".

&gt;It also went up 2012-2013 - not down by a small amount, actually up.

What? In 2011 we spent £694.2 billion. In 2012 we spent £694.4 billion. In 2013 we spent £673.9 billion and it's only in 2014 where spending has gone up to £714 billion. If you take inflation into account, it's only in 2014 onwards (by which time the recovery was already strong) that we started spending more.

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/year_spending_2014UKbn_14bc1n#ukgs302

&gt;Right, now having lost the argument, you've moved the goal posts, the spending is irrelevant it's the deficit we're talking about. 

Errrr, no. You said ""complete gutting of the austerity plan"". How on earth can you justify this statement when we continued spending less each year than the year previous? The deficit as a share of GDP has gone down every year also. There was no economic stimulus here, only a slight reduction in the pace of the deficit reduction.

&gt;Sure, you could say spending went down but if taxes went down too then you're just giving with one hand what you're taking with the other - an idealogical change, not austerity.

Not sure I follow you here. Do you mean tax *receipts* went down, or are you literally talking about tax cuts? If you mean literal tax cuts, I'm not sure you can call cutting taxes while simultaneously also cutting spending on public services so much that you end up spending less overall the end of ""austerity""!

So perhaps the better consequence of the jazz hands thing is not the action itself but the gesture that shows that it is an event where everyone can expect to be treated positively.

However I think the general concept of safe spaces, like this one, is something that is being taken too far. They can work as a short term remedy, and if these people want to do it at their own conference then that's fine. However I think the best way to deal with anxiety is to gradually confront it and move out of your comfort zone.

They say season 4 of the Wire is the greatest television season of all time. They also say that the final season was a major disappointment. 

The thing about Breaking Bad is that it gradually gets better and better and better. Season 1, although still compelling, is by far the weakest (partly because it's half the length of later seasons), and season 5 is (probably.. season 4 is also immense) the strongest. The way it slowly ratchets up the tension, scene by scene, episode upon episode, is masterful, culminating eventually with what is considered the greatest single episode in television history (Ozymandias).

And the Wire doesn't have Walter White.. played by 4-time Emmy winner Bryan Cranston.

&gt;

&gt;The __A23 battery__ (also known as __8LR932 __, __8LR23__, __GP23A__, __MN21__, __V23GA__, 23AE or __[ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI)-1181A__) is a dry cell-type [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity\)) mainly used in small [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics) [keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain) radio devices, such as [keyless vehicle entry systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyless_entry_system), home [security systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_system), [garage door openers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_door_opener), and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) [headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headset_(audio\)#Bluetooth_wireless_headsets).

&gt;An A23 battery is cylindrical, smaller than an [AAA battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_battery), measuring 28.5 mm long and 10.3 mm in [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter), with a typical weight of 8 [grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram). An A23 battery is an 8-[cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(electricity\)) device with a nominal voltage of 12 V. The higher voltage is necessary for the [radio frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency)-[transmitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter) and [receiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio\)) devices which A23 batteries often power. It has a capacity of around 55 mAh.  

&gt;A23 batteries are constructed of 8 individual LR932 alkaline [button cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell) enclosed in a wrapper.

This month’s podcast features an audio extract of one of the stories from Seasons of War : the unofficial Doctor Who charity anthology. The story is called The Celaphas Gift: it was written by Andrew Smith, who wrote the 1980 Tom Baker era Doctor Who episode: Full Circle (Part One) and its novelisation. He’s since gone on to write several Doctor Who audio adventures for Big Finish. The Celaphas Gift is read by Tracey Norman, with sound design by Simon Brett.

Seasons of War is available via donation in a variety of formats. Donations are in aid of the charity Caudwell Children, for disabled children across the UK, and so far over 6 and a half thousand pounds has been raised! It’s a great book, pretty essential for Doctor Who fans, written by a talented selection of writers affiliated with the cult show in a number of ways. You can donate what you like but please consider giving generously if you can.

Well maybe, I can't speak for everyone. From my perspective, I'm capable of understanding that if a girl tells me ""no"", or ""I'm uncomfortable, please stop"" or is drunk enough to not know where she is then trying to have sex with her is 1) unethical and 2) could get me into serious trouble. 

I personally struggle to see how the issue gets complicated apart from maybe if one person is drunk and the other isn't *as* drunk, there is some ambiguity as to when exactly a person is drunk enough for there to be unethical behaviour. The law is pretty clear though that the person has to be too drunk to consent, i.e. unaware of what they are doing. Everything comes down to personal morals after that. 

I do find it quite offensive that I'm assumed by some groups of people to have rape urges because I have a penis; I'm perfectly capable of telling right from wrong. In the grand scheme of things the consent workshops aren't an inherently bad thing, but I think it does highlight a difference in opinion between a more vocal minority among students and the rest of the student body.",null,1,null,1427398492,null,0,false,0,cprpkvi,null,t3_30cvxr,null,t1_cprpkvi,null,t1_cprjri2,null,null,null,1432030864,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
null,false,OhMySaintedTrousers,null,null,null,"I have two answers to this:

Firstly devil's advocaat (an eggy drink for the discerning demon): A consultation is not a referendum. They are two different words meaning two different things. It's quite reasonable, at least in theory, for a consultation to be carried out and the final decision to go against the majority of respondents. Because the decision-making body might be taking into account wider considerations, including the interests of people who didn't respond. (E.g. local people always oppose airports, and consultations reflect this; the wider interest includes the economic benefit to a city twenty miles away...)

Right, that's out of the way, now what I actually think: I've been involved with a few of these in my own small way. I think increasingly a consultation is a little box in the flow-chart of getting-something-done-in-the-face-of-widespread-opposition. The consultation may (truly) help measure the strength of public feeling, but like you, I believe that in more and more of these things the decision has been made, colours have been nailed to masts, before the damn thing is sent out. I would be very surprised if detailed preparations weren't already made for responding to (and then ignoring) the consultation too. 

Incidentally another box in my inferred flowchart comes before the consultation stage, and before controversial plans are even publicly *announced*: look out for the leak. The little, innocent looking leak that someone has been talking to such-and-such. It's very effective.

null,false,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,null,"&gt; It's true you can run a budget deficit forever if you also inflate the money supply in tandem (*) and in a controlled way. However, whether that's a sound basis for a stable free market is debatable.

I'm not saying it's sustainable in perpetuity, but the answer is not to make sweeping cuts to public sector services to minimise outgoings. I firmly believe there are probably wastes in public spending that can be improved, but those should be dealt with on individual merits, and the main focus with regards to the national budget should be on kickstarting growth and investing in business.

QE money leaving the system? It's hard to track, the banks will, it is intended, make profit based on the increased capital, and also will increase lending (maybe the latter comes first, w/e), and so the bank has all this extra money, and at some point the assets traded as part of QE will be traded again in different situations after being sold back. Who can say whether the money was 'recouped', do you look at the success of the banks who were the prime beneficiaries, is success of those banks necessarily indication of recovery (there are places where this seems irrelevant, so is it just London that recovered?) do you look at borrowers? do you look at poverty metrics, overall economic growth, or a whole host of features of the national economy? 

If the BoE sells back the QE assets to the banks, then it's sort of like the BoE giving really amazing loans with the assets as security, which is a fine concept in principle, and I have nothing against it on theoretical grounds, it's just such a hard thing to measure the efficacy of, and there's so many confounders that might be responsible for economic recovery.

Good article, there. I can definitely see where the author's coming from. I read the conference overview PDF that was posted here yesterday, and in so many places, it just felt like it had been written by children who'd spent the last 18 years of their lives wrapped up in cotton at their mum and dad's, who were freaking out at the idea that that sort of thing couldn't last forever. So obviously, basic income was a priority, along with it the notion that all people were special, regardless of who they were, where they were from, what they did and whether they worked or not, and as such, all people should be provided with a nice, warm home in an area of their choice, and enough money to be comfortable and do whatever they wanted, forever. Paid for by 'the rich', of course. It all just seems so transparently to be teenagers unable to come to terms with becoming adults, and having to face up to adult responsibilities, adult life, and adult work. It's kinda sad, really.

&gt; 

You mean normal people except the government of the day right up until they moved the goal posts? Bullshit. One minute is was 1/3rd reduced, next it was halved overnight. 

The second half of your point essentially boils down to - having failed to justify the deficit in your own terms you changed it to *as a percentage of gdp* - which btw, is BS. Then failing *even* by those terms, you've changed it to total spending, not budget deficit - which is not even what anyone is talking about.


You know what you're doing right? First you took into account the size of the economy once - deficit= size of economy * effective tax rate - spending. 


Then you decided to factor in the economy again - deficit as percentage of GDP = (size of economy * effective tax rate - spending)/size of economy

Now you're talking about spending - so you've *completely* moved away from the size of the economy.

1. Met/exceeded my job search requirements for 10 months.

1. Finally offered a job after my 19th interview.

1. Give the JobCentre notice (as per their procedure) that I will be starting on x date and that they need to stop benefits from that date onwards.

1. Stopped looking for work as I had signed the contract and had a firm start date &lt;2 weeks away.

1. Advisor at the jobcentre then informs me she is going to sanction me for not applying for jobs after having already found one.

1. I kicked off about it, they only backed down once they realised if they sanctioned me, I would have to turn down the job offer as I had absolutely no means of getting to work in my first month without that money.

I think you'll find this Economist article from Feb 2014 interesting. It's based mainly on census data from 2011. About 6% of UK children under 5 are now classified as mixed race. The group most likely to have a mixed race marriage is black Caribbean men, almost half of them. Lots of single Caribbean men came over here for work in the 60s and 70s and married white British women, due to the simple fact that the Caribbean women were back home in the Caribbean. 

The group least likely to have a mixed race marriage is South Asian women. 

In any area where you have a non-white population you will also have mixed relationships, especially in the inner cities. It's about as controversial and noteworthy as a short person marrying a tall person. We don't really get why Americans are still hung up about it. You may get second glances in really rural areas, but in those areas anyone not from the village gets second glances. 

Lack of segregation is a major factor, lots more mixing and opportunities to meet. People of all races attend the same schools and hang out at the same clubs. Sheer numbers also plays a role, we're still a white majority country so non-white people looking to date just have more options if they consider dating someone white.

null,false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,null,"There's a sizeable difference between leaving kids at home and having to take your kids to school a couple of hours into your shift. One of them is disruptive to your work schedule. The other isn't.

At the moment, parents take kids to school before work (ie. 8.30am) and then go to work for 9. Even if they dont take them, they tend to make sure that they get off to school before they leave for work. Whilst there hasn't been any comprehensive survey done as far as I'm aware, my experience of working within schools and conversations with people with many, many more years of experience than me tell me that kids whose parents leave for work before they go to school have a higher number of absences and lates. Not because kids all want to play truant, but because it raises the possibility that a kid might be non-seriously ill and decide that this is cause to take a day off, or for kids to oversleep, or any of those other things that crop up when you aren't used to taking responsibility for yourself.

If kids have to be at school for 9.30 (to allow same amount of time for registration etc. for lessons to start at 10) then for parents to ensure that their kid gets to school means that they have to start work an hour later.

If there *is* no school, then it's (mostly) irrelevant what time your shift starts because it has no relevance on your morning routine: you aren't making sure your kids are up and going to school, you aren't making sure that your darling Johnny isn't just ""ill"" because he hasn't done his homework, you aren't making sure that they leave in plenty of time.

There's a big difference between believing a child is capable of not setting your house on fire (which most 11+ kids are trusted to do I feel, especially with things like Facebook and mobiles making keeping in touch with them extremely simple) and trusting your child to get from your house to the school under their own steam every day.

&gt; Abstract: In this assignment I have tried to examine and illuminate the social differences in Denmark. The way this ~~have~~ **has** been done is by taking **point (not sure what this means?)** in my hypothesis which is that individuals with a large**,** annual income ~~is~~ **are** more likely to believe that it’s not the ~~governments’~~ **government's** task to adjust the income ~~dis-parities~~ **disparity (unless you are discussing more than one type of disparity?)** between people with low**,** yearly income and people with fairly high**,** annual income. The way this study has been done ~~is~~ **was** by using different ~~mathematic~~ **mathematical** formulas**,** such as the chi-squared test, which helps in **lightening (not sure what you mean here?)** the different opinions and ~~make~~ **making** them comparable. This paper contains a lot of social science theories and the explanation of social concepts needed to understand why social disparity exists between the lower classes of the society and the more wealthy class. This study can conclude that ~~annually~~ **annual** income affects whether an individual supports regulations ~~to~~ **which** adjust the financial ~~disparities~~ **disparity (again, unless you are talking about more than one disparity?)** between the lower and upper classes in the society.

PIZ BUIN® Ultra Light Dry Touch Sun Fluid is sweat and water resistant.""
About you: Combo dehydrated skin, Very light skin NC15, current hormonal outbreaks, very easily dehydrated.
Your opinion: Surprised myself by really liking this ... I feel it soaks in very quickly ('dry touch' huh), could't see a noticeable white cast (though I am pale). like the fact its water resistant and provides a decent base for the small amount of make up I use. It is fragranced, I love it as I tried this first while Scuba diving in the red sea so it totally reminds me of awesome adventures but not for everyone. 

It is very silicone heavy which I think makes it feel so silky smooth, not a problem for me but not for everyone.
Didn't feel greasy and spread easily.

May very well keep this one up for a while, good basic reliable sunscreen.

If you had a disabled child and someone at work made the joke that your child probably rapes your wife because he's mentally ill would you think there was some deep philosophical and thought provoking element to it?

The story is called The Celaphas Gift: it was written by Andrew Smith, who wrote the 1980 Tom Baker era Doctor Who episode: Full Circle (Part One) and its novelisation. He’s since gone on to write several Doctor Who audio adventures for Big Finish. The Celaphas Gift is read by Tracey Norman, with sound design by Simon Brett.

Seasons of War is available via donation in a variety of formats. Donations are in aid of the charity Caudwell Children, for disabled children across the UK, and so far over 6 and a half thousand pounds has been raised! It’s a great book, pretty essential for Doctor Who fans, written by a talented selection of writers affiliated with the cult show in a number of ways. You can donate what you like but please consider giving generously if you can.

null,false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; If it is such a huge issue then those schools could run a breakfast club, as many already do. 

Extending the teacher's working day? Despite [them not being paid for these additional clubs](http://www.videojug.com/interview/teaching-extracurricular-activities) and already being [overworked and underpaid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10923967/OECD-teachers-overworked-and-not-valued-by-society.html)? Or should we pass it onto support staff, who are [also in the same boat](https://www.atl.org.uk/media-office/media-archive/Overworked-and-underpaid-support-staff-are-feeling-the-knock-on-effects-of-teachers-excessive-workloads.asp)?

Breakfast clubs are great, and it's great that some schools offer them. To suggest that every school that needs to move to a 10-4 timetable as to avoid increased casaulties during winter commutes (which are, as noted elsewhere on this reddit thread, a valid concern when discussing this) should demand that their staff provide this club is unreasonable. We already ask too much of our teachers and it's breeding an unhealthy situation in which the only people teaching in England are those too incompetent to move abroad and teach there. Of the thirty or so people entering PGSE programs this year that I know, only two of them plan to stay within England over the next ten years. We should be making teaching a more favorable job, not creating more demands on their time.

The situation is currently so bad that [50% of qualified teachers eventually go into a different career](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/06/teachers-leave-profession-early) because they are overwhelmed by the workload. The article does say that some of the problem lays in poor support structure, but the overall picture painted for anyone that cares to see it is one that is fairly grim.

&gt;This is only an issue for those schools who would choose to open late in winter anyway

...and the parents of all of those kids, the employers of those parents, the clients of those employees and so on and so forth. A school near me shifted to having a short-day Wednesday where they finished halfway through the afternoon. A number of businesses immediately had to switch to early-closing on Wednesdays because parents needed to collect kids from school (due to lack of school bus, lack of trust, other issues, getting kids from school to another location for various clubs that sprang up, etc.). It *does* have a significant effect to change school timetables, and it's an effect that goes beyond just ""schools who choose to open late in winter"".

There's also a fallacy of choice here. Given the choice between doing something that places kids at risk and doing an alternative option that doesn't place kids at risk, it's very hard to justify the latter as an educational body. ""Think of the children"" is an argument that is very powerful in some places, and one of them happens to be governing bodies of schools.

&gt;all the available carers start work at 9am....wouldn't be able to delay the start of their shift for a few months of the year...

Employers already cater to this to some extent. I know a lot of parents that *already* delay the start of their shift. Delaying it further starts to get ridiculous however: it's one thing to have your employees turn up an hour late and make up time by staying late. It's another thing to have employees turn up two hours late.

Unless you're suggesting that parents work night shifts or afternoon shifts. These have their own problems, but it would probably solve the issue of ""parents having to delay the start of their shift"" and change it to ""parents being unable to assist with homework"" (which is an important part of the education system - and one that some parents don't understand feeling that the full pressure should be on the teachers, which also contributes to the overwhelming workload, but that's another thing altogether - and one that is [already proving difficult](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2905552/Two-thirds-parents-admit-t-help-children-school-homework-s-hard.html) for some).

Yes, perhaps there are ways that families can work around requiring to take their children to school at 10am, but  doing that as a family is difficult. You don't marry someone to sleep whilst they work, and you don't have kids to never spend time with them, and there are only so many flexible employers available that also provide sufficient money to support the family.

&gt;that just seems too specific and trivial a reason to continue to restructure the entire system of time

Trivial until you realise that you're expecting a specific set of regions to restructure their timetables and staffing and support systems just to avoid an issue that is avoided completely by keeping things as they are.

Naturally, there are many *many* other arguments on both sides of the debate. All of this is mostly aimed at informing you why we can't just ""change school timetables"" because it might make things more convenient. I'm honestly not particularly fussed on this entire issue (though if we stayed on BST, going to Double Summer Time *would* be problematic) as I work non-standard hours in any case and only really do 9-5 jobs during the school holidays when I do workshops and such.

My favoured solution to the entire issue of school timetables (which is part of this discussion on some level) is to make school match normal working timetables, with fully modular courses structured across a tiered-level system. Modular system would allow for gifted students to advance rapidly or have a wider breadth of courses, less gifted students could use the spare time for the out-of-class work. Homework would be a non-entity essentially, as you'd be given time within the ""school day"" to sort it out. Younger students would be expected for less time than older students, with students doing A-levels doing the full working year as a school year: this offers a clear transition into working life and working expectations. Unfortunately, this is a ridiculously large change from the current system: so large that it will never even be contemplated, let alone seriously discussed. This solution would remove the issues with work, because your kid would be at school whenever you were at work.

TL;DR [Get A BRAIN! MORANS](https://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/morans.jpg)

Seriously, is that the best you can do to defend your entirely objective and not the least bit emotional position? Are you actually daft enough to suppose that you have the misfortune to be the most intelligent and well-informed person in the room? 'Cos we're all royally fucked if you are.

As is well and widely known, many methods of energy production have associated costs not necessarily reflected in the purchase price at the point of supply, including renewables which enjoy a variety of breaks and subsidies, not least because the UK has a commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Get back to me when you've figured out how to spread the cost of nuclear decommissioning without the government stepping in to bail out Sellafield. Or don't - square that circle and you'll be a squillionaire anyway. In the meantime I suggest you spend more time studying the subject, and less lobbing infantile insults.

For some period of time, you got the feeling that most MPs were basically bags of meat whose primary duties were keeping their mouths shut, not doing anything embarrassing, and then, vote how they were instructed by their party leadership.

The work done by the backbench standards committee - increasing the ability of Parliament to regulate its own affairs, rather than the agenda being shaped by the government - seems to have had a really good effect. 

Now the select committees are operating with some independence, and an MP can do something interesting with their time in parliament without having to cilmb the greasy pole into the cabinet or shadow cabinet.

A surprisingly large amount of out emissions are from residential usages. People don't always think about it because it's not as immediately obvious as your car pumping out emissions is for example.

To put it into perspective, in 2013 the entire energy production sector in the UK produced around 178.5MtCO2, Transport 116.7MtCO2, residential usage was 76.9MtCO2.

What you said about it being warmer does indeed make a significant different on UK emissions. Residential emissions increased by 3% between 2012 and 2013 figures, that's partly due to the fact that the first quarter of 2013 2.7 years cooler than the previous year.

I'm talking about pouring hours into the scene, not his casting, in fact I'm the only negative person in this thread to have phrased my distaste for his casting in something that isn't ""He's shit lol"". With all due respect, if I really wanted to go pro at dota I wouldn't have taken the route I did, I play dota in my spare time as a hobby. If I wanted to go further than where I am I could pretty do it whether you believe it or not I'm afraid but I guess that looks too much like speculation than anything else. 

The only reason I mentioned pros flaming him is because you mentioned pros praising him? You've attempted to discredit something I've said by claiming it's irrelevance when I've already claimed that I don't understand where exactly this line of argument could go.

You have no idea how I feel about Durka JoeShow or Rusts, you're just spouting something you feel is true because you must think it helps your argument, but it really doesn't.

I feel as if I made it pretty obvious that I don't like his casting and pointed out why, I also don't like KOTLGuy, Basskip, Luminous, SUNSfan, Ayesee or Purge and I've hated on them quite a bit in the past and don't think *any* of them should be allowed casting gigs so your baseless accusation that I don't like ODPixel and therefore that must be why I have come out against his casting is pretty stupid.

Pointy, come on, you've really made one valid point in your two posts and that was my discrediting of the exposure his tweets could do for iSeries viewers which I'll happily admit I was wrong about to phrase it in such a way, but that still doesn't mean he is doing anything for the scene right now. I'm not sure why we're even talking about it though, it's not like anyone here feels that he should raise a flag for UKDota in the overall scene.

Shockingly, I think we could just hire in extra staff for this without the work collapsing.

&gt;It does have a significant effect to change school timetables, and it's an effect that goes beyond just ""schools who choose to open late in winter"".

Yeah, I saw pointing out that this is not something the would affect all schools. The fact that as you're pointing out some schools already run timetable whcih aren't just straight 9-330's kind of backs up my point that this isn't a world changer.

&gt;Unless you're suggesting that parents work night shifts or afternoon shifts.

They already do.

&gt; Yes, perhaps there are ways that families can work around requiring to take their children to school at 10am, but doing that as a family is difficult. You don't marry someone to sleep whilst they work, and you don't have kids to never spend time with them, and there are only so many flexible employers available that also provide sufficient money to support the family.

Why exactly is getting a kid to school an hour later than currently such a gigantic hassle exactly? If anything I'd think it would be easier. You could even just drop them off at school for 9 and let them play for an hour honestly you seem really obsessed by this idea that families would collapse because they had an extra hour in the morning for 2 months per year.

&gt;All of this is mostly aimed at informing you why we can't just ""change school timetables"" because it might make things more convenient. 

Yes we could. My local school changed its timetable last year an no one gave a shit because, funnily enough, people have lives that are complex and difficult and slight variations in school times tables are utterly irrelevant to the huge, huge majority of people. For those cases that might have a problem cause there are many many possible public policy solutions that would sort it. 

Changing the clocks would mean everyone got an extra hour of evening sun at the expense of one when most of us are asleep. People would have more time to go outside, power would be saved, there would be fewer accidents on the roads and kids would get to play. I don't really care that a few schools would get an hours lie in for 2 months of the year. They'd fucking survive. 

&gt;My favoured solution to the entire issue of school timetables (which is part of this discussion on some level) is to make school match normal working timetables, with fully modular courses structured across a tiered-level system. Modular system would allow for gifted students to advance rapidly or have a wider breadth of courses, less gifted students could use the spare time for the out-of-class work. Homework would be a non-entity essentially, as you'd be given time within the ""school day"" to sort it out. Younger students would be expected for less time than older students, with students doing A-levels doing the full working year as a school year: this offers a clear transition into working life and working expectations. Unfortunately, this is a ridiculously large change from the current system: so large that it will never even be contemplated, let alone seriously discussed. This solution would remove the issues with work, because your kid would be at school whenever you were at work.

So you always have to put things in perspective.

That being said, Tottenham is a healthy club with great ambitions, and a great place for Kane to grow; arguably the best place for him to grow. We're also financially secure enough to be able to offer him great deals year after year if he keeps improving.

Also, St Andrews is so conservative that I doubt the NUS Leadership would have any common ground with many of the Students. We were the only university in the UK that, to my knowledge, didn't uphold the sporting boycott of South Africa during apartheid.

In summary, **The Speaker**, the man in the center of the House of Commons, is essentially meant to be in a kind of unbiased referee. They are meant to maintain order in the House whilst also being fair in allowing which side to speak, argue etc. There is all sorts of other things they do but i don't know yet. I think they can punish/ban people though. A powerful position. 

The process of who becomes The Speaker is obviously important. Does it come to a vote... votes by MPs in the House of Commons are public. 

Charles Walker, the man getting angry and a little bit emotional runs a committee on the process of how the speaker should be picked. He wants it to be a vote (so it is more public and accountable) not a secret ballot. This is so whips have little to no power lurking in the shadows and their tactics will be largely visible. (I assume)     

**Whips** are, from my understanding people that persuade/threaten their own members to vote alongside their party. While i imagine they are some shadowy mother fuckers, I understand the need for them. If you want to go somewhere fast go alone, if you want to go somewhere far go together. And the more i understand about politics the more i understand the need for back scratching/favors in all sorts of situations because any amount of deadlock is very dangerous for any government/country.   

Charlie-boy has been working on this report since early 2013. (I don't imagine non-stop but these things take time). 

Anyway, my explanation is running the risk of being longer than /u/lgf92 but to cut it short. The whips, the House leader (Mr Hauge the bald man) and others have not only met with Charles about this, but have conspired against him (a member of their own party) and attempted to push through their own plans in a very short coordinated time frame to avoid any resistance/reaction to make sure that the candidate of the Speaker come to a public vote.

They had to look Charles in the face and basically chat with him as if he were a friend and party member (which is he), which is why he feels like a honorable fool.    

Also the applause from the opposition (mainly labour members if am right), and clapping is very un-parliamentary.
 
With this all in mind, watch the video again, it should make more sense.

Meeting people isn't difficult at all in St Andrews. You'll meet people first through your chosen accommodation, then through your course, then through any societies etc that you join. Even in my first few weeks there were always people to do things with, and then after a couple of months I had found friends both near my residence and from my course who I remained close with throughout. If you have particular interests/hobbies that you'd like to pursue whilst you're there, you'll have no trouble findings lots of like-minded people - this will also give you the opportunity to get to know students from varying years and courses, which is great. I wish I'd been a little more active socially, but even so I had countless fun times. Like with any other university, regardless of size, you'll get out what you put in - the only people I saw feeling bored or lonely were those who hid in their rooms and didn't make any effort to get on with people.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"Well your view may be that measuring the deficit as a % of GDP is ""BS"", but it's a pretty standard way of looking at the spending position that government is in, it has been used widely for a long time, and for very good reason: The number itself is irrelevant without the context of the size of the economy it relates to. 

You obviously know this, but just in case: In your sums, make the ""size of the economy"" number bigger and bigger, and see how a given spending figure becomes a relatively smaller and smaller amount. Doesn't really matter if you then divide the number by the size of the economy or not at the end, you'll find the same result either way. It's pretty obvious stuff really.

It's just like looking at the actual total government debt figure as opposed to debt as % of GDP. The total debt figure is just a big number, but when you see it as a % of GDP it makes sense.

You seem to think I'm some sort of Tory fanboy, trying to justify them or something. I'm not, I'm actually a LD fan if anything. But the fact remains that trying to spend our way our of recession in '10-'12 when we already had a 8% deficit would have been a stupid idea, and the evidence since then backs this up. The government didn't ease up on ""austerity"" much until much more recently and by then we were already growing strongly anyway, and with the private sector driving growth too as it should be. 

&gt;Now you're talking about spending - so you've completely moved away from the size of the economy.

This is another thing I find a bit odd: How can you on the one hand state that deficit as % of GDP is ""BS"" and that the absolute deficit figure is what's important, but on the other hand chastise me for talking in absolute spending terms to prove that in actual fact the government didn't really ease up on austerity much as they spent less year on year until recently? Would you prefer I used govt spending as a % of GDP too? I assure you it shows the same thing as the rest of the figures I've already given you do...

Finally if you remember the point I was *really* making when I dove into this epic bullshit, is that Paul Krugman was wrong to suggest in mid 2012 that we needed to spend 2% of GDP on economic stimulus to get any growth again. Doesn't matter if you agree how much we cut, how big our deficit still is or anything else... you must agree definitely DIDN'T do anything like that, and we actually started growing all the same 6 months later.

null,false,locster,uk,Leamington Spa,null,"&gt; the main focus with regards to the national budget should be on kickstarting growth and investing in business.

I see that as a circular argument. There has been an attempt to do just that by flooding the 'system' with money (low base rate and QE). It didn't work anywhere near as quickly as hoped because most of the new money was held by banks to shore up their reserve requirements, and they were also risk averse towards new loans, due to the crash and fears about the how far the system was being stretched. If governments could achieve more balance between income and expenditure during 'normal' times, then there is far more scope for forms of intervention that are more controlled, and not so fear inducing.

I appreciate that what I'm saying amounts to ""the best protection against a deep crash is to avoid a deep crash"", but when we suggest spending when the debt is already high, then we have to consider the risk in the medium term of having less nimble government finances in the event of another crash - something which still seems like a very real possibility over the next few years.

It's a balancing act. I agree that cutting essentials for the sake of cutting a budget is a bad idea, I think Greece is testament to that. People will disagree on what is essential though, my facebook feed is testament to that!

While i agree it is undemocratic the other things i said i feel are also important. The risk of deadlock. 

Also if you join a party, are there not party policies set by the leader? Also wouldn't the leader have more of a chance to actually get things done because of the people on their side? or voting on their side.

Again, im the one saying they seem like ""shadowy mother fucker"" but i understand the need. 

I'm trying to imagine politics without whips, where everyone was free thinking and not working as a whole. A school of fish that scatter instead of move as one. 

Not only would there be no need for the party since everyone would be independent but compromise would be impossible.

From what i can see about politics, it is all a balance.

Indeed most people will fall for the charms of a player like Sanchez who unselfishly gives everything for the team and runs like a rabbit during hunting season. That's normal. But also a bit shallow. A player who is more reserved defensively and more orchestral in attack, surely that is neither better or worse than the situation I sketched above. Yet people tend to forget or ignore that assists and goals are not the only way to measure the brilliance of a player like Hazard. The first half of the season he was just as good as Sanchez but in another way. If you know football, than you can see that he thinks much faster than most of the other players on the pitch.

null,false,mctt,null,null,null,"Here is a quick answer. I've made some assumptions, if they are wrong feel free to correct them.

1.There is no written contract. No loan agreement. If there had been you stand a much better chance of the law being of assistance to you. 

2.The photos and letter approach is something you have come up with yourself. These thoughts and plans don't have independent sensible advice.

Don't send anything to her or her parents yourself. Only a standard letter written by somebody qualified and independent from the issue is a sensible possibility. 

3.As I read yesterday, £8000 is a lot of money to owe and not a lot to own.
This means you got off light. 
From now you don't have to lend anyone money. Especially money you don't have (student loan).
Any future financial arrangement you make will be tempered by this experience.

Lastly, I want to caution again about the letter and photos idea. You may have noticed the publicity surrounding compromising revenge photos. Read up on this.

 The good news is that you live at home so you are able make money faster than if you were in a rental contract. 
Working and working with people will help to put this experience behind you and put it in context.

Again, I hope the assumptions are good enough for this opinion to make sense. I know it would be nice to have a silver bullet answer to just get the money back. Instead, consider this point of view;
