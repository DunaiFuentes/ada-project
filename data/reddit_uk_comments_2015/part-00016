I'm from San Francisco too, Safeway's at $1.64 for an onion. That's more than a quid! FOR ONE ONION! That's a ludicrous ripoff given that the onions are likely grown in the Central Valley, 90 minutes away. Mushrooms are $4.32 a pound, that's roughly the price of a kilogram here (2.2 lbs). 

Niche stuff can be really expensive - $6.09 for six Aidell's sausages (for the Brits, they're a local brand of high-quality sausages) is a lot. A pound of pastrami from the deli is $15.39! It's been seven years but I recall there often be a dramatic price difference if you strayed away from own brand items. You'll pay through the nose for anything that's imported or really high-quality (When I come home, I'll get a couple packs of dogs, some really good buns, good German-style mustard and sauerkraut, and end up about $40 lighter). 

But there are some things you get great value on, like avocados and cherries, and I think beef is cheaper as well. 5.5 lbs of chicken thighs for $8.20 is a steal by UK standards.

null,false,casey2256,null,null,null,"I guess this is why I wanted to go with the idea of personification instead of the more common idea of being ""self aware"". What separates us from the rest of species? Recognition of self right? Some will want to argue that there are other species that can recognize self. But then you need to ask well do they recognize self do to our experiments and what we have defined as self recognition or is it innately in them? So is it that we recognize self because of them through evolution or do they recognize self do to us? A bird called the magpie is self aware using the mirror test. It’s easy now to look in a mirror and say yep that’s me, but it’s a million times harder to say that this is just a visual representation of trillions of moving, living, self-replicating entities. 

This is the principles that I would like to use in defining self fulfilling prophecy:
Robert Merton's concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy stems from the Thomas theorem, which states that ""If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.""[2] According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to these perceptions. This causes people to have negative viewpoints. Therefore, their behavior is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

So we are just a bunch of self replicating entities that have evolved into a self recognizing being. 

Right now for me a self aware human would be the ideas discussed in the movie Lucy a man or woman human, that can access 100% percent of the electromagnetic spectrum both internally and externally. For machine or for a once inanimate object I would think being self aware would be along the lines of the movie Transcendence. Trying to create the one thing that both man and “god” have yet to accomplish utopia/heaven for all forms of life. 

Where I was going with the idea of Clara and the Tardis was more on the lines that if the Tardis could be human from the start and had never actually been a “machine”. Her and I do mean for both of them now would be different both in actions and thoughts.  So Clara would be the idea of the Tardis being a human being 100% learning about life, time travel, space from the sole viewpoint of being a human being. Where the being self aware part would come into place is sorta how us humans are as mentioned above,  aware that we are both human cells (clara) and bacteria (tardis). They wouldn't need to have the same consciousness. Much like I don't think  that the bacteria and the human cells within me share the same consciousness ((other then what I actually believe to be my own consciousness)Casey or mind). Since they are what I am made of however I do know that they “talk” and communicate with each other(and ultimately with “me”).  What if it took those 10 trillion bacterial cells and human cells working together to turn on our subconscious/conscious mind? 

I am not sure if this has actually help to explain the level of self aware/personification I was trying to express. But it certainly has been fun to think about. Thanks

Well I disagree. Local councils are elected, but you don't see them challenging the commons and say they should rule the country directly instead. Would you also rather local councils were unelected in case they did? What exactly do you think is going to happen, that as soon as they Lords becomes elected they are going to start demanding new powers? Even if they did they wouldn't get them, so what makes you think they are any different from any other elected body performing a limited clearly defined role?

&gt; I would rather get rid of it altogether and just have a Commons than have two elected houses competing.

I would rather have two houses, elected in different ways, for different term lengths, performing distinct separate roles. That's the way it works for the majority of democracies in the world. Our antiquated undemocratic system is not better, and the only argument against it seems to be fear of the unknown.

Why is he comparing Islam to the Holocaust? The Holocaust _itself_ was obscene, not just the mocking of it.  
Is he saying that Islam is deeply offensive?

Many publications have run cartoons mocking Hitler, because he started and led a movement which denied free thought and became powerful and dangerous. Cartoons which mock prophets and ISIS leaders exist for the same reasons.

Then he poses this what-if scenario:

&gt;  ...if a man had joined the “unity rally” in Paris on 11 January “wearing a badge that said ‘Je suis Chérif’” – the first name of one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen... Would they have seen this lone individual as a hero ...?

Well, people support Charlie Hebdo because those people didn't actually _kill_ anyone. Whereas Chérif Kouachi _did_. That's why no-one's defending him.

Later Hasan completely misunderstands Charlie Hebdo's Christiane Taubira monkey picture, which was actually ridiculing FN and Anne-Sophie Leclere.

And so on.

Hasan is normally articulate and persuasive, but this article doesn't make a lot of sense. His argument is full of holes.

**Edit**

Didn't shoot him dead, though.

my advice would be to play a lot more, until you are at least 5k+ before re-evaluating how to get your name out there and become accomplished. UK Dota inhouse league would be a good place to start I think with the minimum standard being 3kmmr+. You will learn a lot there I think and quickly realize to become ""accomplished"" and known is not something the average UK dota redditor can just give you a magical formula for - Most of the top recreational inhouse players are 5k+ (if not 6k+), most of who would not even consider themselves ""accomplished"".

&gt;Given the reaction to the Anglo Irish Agreement, where one of the proposals of which was cross border cooperation on security, it's a fair assumption that the DUP and UUP would have been against this particular proposal.

Doesn't stop them from [singing Blue is the Colour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHY1iyl-t0k). What might stop them is stewards though, there's no way they'd get away with that movement. Or these ones from singing [Chelsea Alouette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTf59dm-600). And just for shits and giggles here's [12 mins worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZuJanwKSgE) of these foreign non-English Chelsea fans chanting.

And I brought up the away fans to provide a control. Taking into account the different cultures home vs away, there's obviously a segment that wants to vocally support Chelsea. Besides that though, there are factors limiting how good the atmosphere is at home. 

It's not like 100% of the local, English Chelsea fans are all singing. So I find that saying the foreigners and tourists definitely negatively impact the atmosphere is lazy and flimsy. Does every tourist or foreigner sing the chants? No probably not. But not every English does either. Perhaps it's where they're sitting. The stands that are the most vocal are also where most ST holders are seated and harder to get into. Do you expect the tourist to get up and start singing when everyone else around them isn't? 

Re the maths: Yeah I mucked that up. I factored in away fans (3000) which made it 79%, but forgot that 79%+11% doesn't equal 100 lol sorry about the brain fart.

By all means if we can get in Hummels or someone else top class then do it, then look to move Skrtel on.

How would that work? If end-to-end encryption means that one key is on my phone and stays there, and another key is on the other person's phone and stays *there*, then how would the warrant be enforced?

They could, of course, seize the phone and demand any passwords or encryption keys. They can do that under current law (pray you don't forget your password, you could go to prison). But I would assume that they want to do this non-intrusively and in bulk.

Banning end-to-end encryption would, naturally, be the next suggestion of an idiot.

The difference is that the world was shamed into trying to make things better for a stateless people. This didn't change the British wanted list at the time though.

Terror groups come and go, they become politicised, they lose their edge and people see them as selling out so they spin off and create new ones. Faction after faction with little of no connection to each other in reality will emerge and try to grab the limelight and the best you can do is apply a label that covers peoples of 50 different countries.

In October, Rightmove predicted a 1.7% fall in prices. [According to the Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/october-2014-market-trend-data), prices actually _rose_ by 0.1%. For September prices, Rightmove predicted a rise of 2.6%, [whereas prices actually _fell_](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/september-2014-market-trend-data) by 0.2%.

Basically, don't believe anything Rightmove says about the market. It's all just PR and marketing for their website, and pretty successful too.

Also, take a look at their December analysis ([PDF](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/files/2014/12/december-2014.pdf), page 10), which shows the results of their previous months' predictions versus Nationwide and Halifax.

First question, is this study useful? Why are you comparing Swansea and Bristol? All research begins with a hypothesis, I am wondwering what yours is?


What useful information is there if we find out one place has a higher rate then the other? Social research needs to have an outcome that is useful. If you do find a big differnece, I would have a hard time writing about why that is.

You're assuming that that's ""a thing""- that we're currently paying people to do nothing particularly useful, and that these people are easy to identify and fire.

Maybe at the moment we're paying a few civil servants to do nothing but order the printer paper and ballpoint pens for the rest of the civil service. That's not sexy like fighting crime or healing the sick, so we could sack them saving £25k a piece. But we did actually need that paper and pens- that's a boring but necessary part of civil service life. 

No organisation- public or private- willingly pays people to do nothing useful. Generally speaking, if you cut jobs budgets and lay people off, *something* will suffer.

They just want a nice place you can have a drink with friends, get merry and stumble home a 1'oclock in the morning. 

It is a shame that pub culture is becoming a thing of the past. There used to be 10 good pubs in my village 20 years ago. Now that number is at 3, with one maybe closing down. The only ""pubs"" that now have a chance of staying open for long are chains like Wetherspoons.

While I understand why they'd want it, I'd never be happy to see a foreign Swans fan pushing for the 39th game, for example. I'd consider it a betrayal if they actively voiced support for it when it's common knowledge that those of us watching week in week out are dead against it.

It's a complicated one but I do feel like any distant fans should follow us in any boycotts or movements we make as an almost entire fanbase. My main thing with them is, when it comes down to it, that I fully welcome them to become one of us *so long as that's what they intend to be*, rather than just an outsider who is in it for solely their own entertainment. If the Liberty is unitied in saying that we don't want the 39th game, or we don't want foreign investment, then I'd be *extremely* bitter if we were undermined by the foreign support base.

I don't agree with everything I read on this subreddit, but everyone seems to have a respect for what the club is about, rather than just liking some of our players and wanting more players they liked lumped in. That's why I like being a mod here and why I keep getting involved in discussions, because I'm happy to share my club with the people here that I talk to.

2.2.1 The A14 Study identified that there is severe congestion at several sections and junctions of the A14 under normal conditions (i.e. during the typical dayto-day traffic conditions). Analysis during the morning and evening peak times showed that there are several locations where the average traffic speed is below 20mph. Analysis undertaken by the Highways Agency identified the A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon as the fourth busiest hotspot on the trunk
road network in England in 2008. A ‘hotspot’ is defined when a  congestion alert is issued when the speeds break down to below 30mph and include both severe traffic congestion and incidents.

And in what is surely the worst, dumbest paragraph of the lot is this collection of literary excrement:

&gt;Has your publication, for example, run cartoons mocking the Holocaust? No? How about caricatures of the 9/11 victims falling from the twin towers? I didn’t think so (and I am glad it hasn’t). Consider also the “thought experiment” offered by the Oxford philosopher Brian Klug. Imagine, he writes, if a man had joined the “unity rally” in Paris on 11 January “wearing a badge that said ‘Je suis Chérif’” – the first name of one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen. Suppose, Klug adds, he carried a placard with a cartoon mocking the murdered journalists. “How would the crowd have reacted? . . . Would they have seen this lone individual as a hero, standing up for liberty and freedom of speech? Or would they have been profoundly offended?” Do you disagree with Klug’s conclusion that the man “would have been lucky to get away with his life”?

Firstly, publications are free to mock the Holocaust. They don't because it'd be bad for business.  
Secondly, publications are free to mock 9/11. They don't because it'd be bad for business.  
Finally, the hypothetical 'Je suis Chérif' man would be exercising free speech.

I guess what i'm trying to say is that swansea have never been a global club and the majority of their support (if not all) has always been a passionate local hardcore. Now that your in the PL your popularity is growing and for some traditionalists (like myself) I feel as though top flight football is somehow taking away the passion and hardcore support that clubs such as swansea are known for. Do you agree? 

A perfect example is how you so millions of foreign Liverpool, Arsenal and Man U fans and proclaim how much they love their club and consider themselves fans having never even seen them at the stadium. Are you concerned with this possibly happening to the swans?

In reply to Q2 its refreshing to hear a level headed jack, and yes I have seen your posts on /r/soccer so I imagined your response would be more pragmatic!

Yeh born and bred merthyr. Historically its been a cardiff stronghold but with younger supporters having seen swansea become the first welsh PL team (plus a lot of bandwagoners) the tide is turning.

This is a rather childish and simplistic view, so I guess you're not particularly old?

&gt;A significant enough minority that any post that offends the group-think is downvoted. Just like it's happening to this one, as I predicted, as the lazy lefty students get out of bed during mid-day.

I agree that downvotes shouldn't be used just because people disagree, but I don't think there's a ""group-think"" at work here. Rather, it's just how Reddit seems to be as a site. If you go onto a more conservative subreddit, you'll probably find left-wing opinions being downvoted. Then again, you put in something childish and simple-minded like calling people ""lazy"", of course you're going to be downvoted and of course it'll confirm your bias.

&gt;He is asking that people stop name calling and supressing anything that contradicts their world view. I don't think he could be any more clear about that. He's actually doing the left a favour - more people would listen if you argued from a more mature angle and less of a self-righteous condescending one.

You should take your own advice and stop both the name-calling and the condescension.

While I'd agree with your sentiment normally, it is actually the case that the government is influenced by religious feeling from Christians far more than any other group. Also it's the case that Sundays are 'different' specifically because of the church. Indeed once upon a time it was a legal requirement to attend church. ALso the government follows the Christian line on certain subjects when the general public appear to be aligned the other way.

Consider debates/legislation on assisted dying, compulsory sex education/PSHE in schools or even the refusal of the last Labour government to remove the law requiring a compulsory daily act of collective (Christian) worship in schools.

It's really hard to find acne patches in the UK, no-one seems to want to do them. Some cold sore ones are, but not all are. My favourite brand are Dotz, they do three types of hydrocolloids:

* [Acne](http://i.imgur.com/na0St5Z.jpg) - pre cut in multiple sizes
* [Blister Plaster](http://i.imgur.com/I6NTJlW.jpg?1) - Two large sizes you have to cut yourself, thicker than the acne patches
* [Cold Sore Patches](http://i.imgur.com/qua2gxr.jpg) - 7 pre cut hydrocolloids thinner than the blister plasters, slightly thicker than acne &amp;amp; 7 thin plasters that are also useful to stop touching. They're also really really thin so you can wear them all day with no-one seeing.

I buy them in Poundland/99p Shop when I see them, but I saw the cold sore patches in Savers, and you can buy them on eBay/Amazon.

Nexcare Patches are an Asian acne patch that are also good. I bought some off eBay but you can apparently find them in the 99p shop at times. 

Most pharmacies do a hydrocolloid. If you can, lightly prick it with a sterile needle as it needs an 'open wound' to suck all the gunk out.

null,false,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,null,"&gt;I guess what i'm trying to say is that Swansea have never been a global club and the majority of their support (if not all) has always been a passionate local hardcore. Now that your in the PL your popularity is growing and for some traditionalists (like myself) I feel as though top flight football is somehow taking away the passion and hardcore support that clubs such as Swansea are known for. Do you agree?

Yes and no. The undeniable fact is that we were not selling out the stadium before getting to the top flight, we had to grow into it as it's double the size that the Vetch was. That means the people coming in are as it stands not pushing anyone else out. The West Stand was always quieter and had a lot more empty seats before this league, while the East Stand *generally* hasn't changed much (barring a few off games, generally in non-league competitions where people have ended up in the wrong areas of the ground).

The Premier League as a whole I find a bit detrimental though in terms of what you're asking about. A small but easy to notice aspect of this is how as a Football League club, our stadium had fans' flags all the way around. Now they've all been replaced with advertising boards that cannot be covered under any circumstances.

We haven't lost anything regarding our identity yet but there are some aspects of the Premier League that I'm very weary of and hope that it doesn't creep in too heavily. As I've said elsewhere, I think the foreign fans we pick up are as it stands culturally aware and respectful, and indeed it's our identity that draws them to us over the bigger clubs. I'm very aware that higher levels of success could change that.

&gt;In reply to Q2 its refreshing to hear a level headed jack

The reality is that my opinion is more common than you might think, even in the pubs on matchday.

Oh please, the loss of Byzantine lands would have meant jack shit to the likes of Frederick, Bohemond, Godfroi etc.  The Pope knew the score, but he sold it as a holy undertaking, complete with lists of atrocities the infidels were committing. 

&gt;Apart from that the only actual 'terrorism' on your list of barrel scrapings is the bombing of abortion clinics in the U.S

Only?  Surely one is enough to matter.  Had 911 been the only Muslim attack, would you be saying ""yeah it's not good, but it was just the *once*?""  I doubt it.  Secondly, admitting that Christians are and have been complicit in suffering all over the world, and then qualifying it with , ""it's not actually terrorism"" speaks volumes.  

Mother Theresa wasn't just a shit (incompetant) nurse; she knew exactly what she was doing.  All those people she allowed to suffer in her care, suffered because she thought it got them (and presumably her) closer to Jesus.

&gt;My point is that the biggest source of religious terrorism in Europe comes from Islam, and that cannot be denied.

Sure, right now that's true - is anyone denying that?

I've seen that poll report before.  You've no idea under what conditions individuals answered those questions.  A muslim talking to a pollster while his / her family was in earshot might give radically different answers if he / she was speaking in total confidence. 

Rather than trust the polls, it's easier to go back to the texts that you all (Jews, Christians, Muslims) believe in.  That's what I'm talking about when I say that you all have the same fundamental beliefs.  Mankind was ejected from Eden because of a women, that it's a good thing to offer your son's life as a sacrifice to a voice in your head, that it's the sporting thing to do to offer your daughters up to be raped by a town to stop ""angels"" from being hurt, that the slaughter of men and the slavery of women and girls (to be treated like your chattels no less) is OK as long Jehovah / God / Allah tells you so, etc. etc. etc.

The Christian cult has many benign members, no-one disputes that.  So does Islam.  But the belief system that the two share is not benign; and provides a divine mandate for the hardliners to use violence.  By perpetuating the belief system, you perpetuate the violence.

This is a common response, ""I don't have anything to hide"". Just because you have ""nothing to hide"" does not mean you have nothing to fear from this law. Surveillance is not about finding out if you are committing any crime. It is about finding out how they can manipulate you. There are things in everyone's life that they do not want out in the open. Even if those things are legal.

Let's play a game I want you to record every aspect of your life for a year, video recordings of your day, receipts from shops, your bank statements, copies of your emails, recordings of you phone calls. A list of things you watched on Netflix, the sites you visited, the comments you made on forums. Everything. I bet you won't do it.

It is not about what you have to hide, it is about if you want every aspect of your life out in the open for all to see.

I often find that this is not the case. I'm speaking mostly from personal experience but I feel that people only post their most notable parts of their lives on social media simply because that will get the most attention and likes.

I only ever see things like Celebrated events and holidays or Funerals and Tragic news posted on Facebook and other social media. 

Simply looking at someones Facebook page isn't a good insight into who they are and what goes on in their life.

Holtby is about the only thing they have providing consistent movement and sources of throughballs. He's also been playing mostly as the left winger in their formation since November, a position that is not at all conducive to his abilities. Yes, it has been disappointing, but it's still a team trying to find their feet and Holtby has been nowhere near among the worst of them.

null,false,Colonel_Blimp,null,null,null,"Brief answer as I've not got much time atm but I'm English (and a quarter Welsh!) and came to support Swansea because I lived there from when I was 1 in 1995. I lived in Wales down in the Gower for about a decade, a beautiful place to grow up but eventually my family moved to where most of their family live, Bournemouth. When I was little I had to support Bournemouth too of course because of my Dad, though my Dad tried to make me an Arsenal fan when I was barely able to talk. I resisted but admittedly I flirted with Liverpool for some time because Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard were my boyhood heroes.

But it was at the Vetch in its last few years that I really came to love football. I got invested pretty quickly and threw a right proper tantrum when we lost only the second game I went to! (Probably my earliest memory of a live game). Tragically I missed the Hull game because Dad was painting our guest bedroom and being 6 I couldn't exactly go myself, but we were dancing around the room when the good news came through on the radio.

Sadly we moved away then, when we were getting our shit together in League 2, and probably my low point as a Swan's fan was becoming a bit disconnected from the club during some depressing times after moving to England. However when we went up from League 2 I finally got back into it and followed our rise up from there as much as I could, even though I've been to only a few games since. I remember that we went up to the Prem during my first year of A-Levels IIRC (we won the League Cup in my freshers year at uni so it must be) and that playoff semi final, which I streamed on my laptop, was one of the most epic things I've ever seen. So after over a decade I've effectively followed us all the way to the best of my ability though I wish I'd had the confidence to go to away days on my own because I could have done in the last couple of years. 

I did manage to see us play away at Southampton in the League Cup season. Nathan Dyer's equaliser, the salute, and I actually remember really well the flawlessly observed minutes silence for Remembrance Day. 

On top of this I've been following my very local family club Bournemouth, so these days I basically say I support both even though on a personal level I feel more connected to the Swans - hence why when anything comes up about Bournemouth on /r/soccer I end up being a lone Swans flair commenting on it bizarrely like the Bournemouth flairs there. Been to tons of their games since and seen them play in three leagues, been in a few pitch invasions and I share a barber with their right back. Needless to say one of my big footballing disappointments in recent times has been that Shaun MacDonald hasn't become a key cog in Eddie Howe's Barmy Army.",null,0,null,1421175461,null,0,false,0,cnnt6aw,null,t3_2s6vcf,null,t1_cnnt6aw,null,t1_cnmqo72,null,null,null,1424897357,null,2,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,2,null

Sorry... I don't mean to be rude, but, are you actually being serious? /u/AnxiousMo-Fo gave basically why local councils are irrelevant - to explain further would just be patronizing.

&gt;What exactly do you think is going to happen, that as soon as they Lords becomes elected they are going to start demanding new powers?

That's what elected politicians do - they push for power. The European Parliament pushes for more power from the Commission and the national governments; local councils push for more power from Parliament within their jurisdictions. The Lords has limited power *because it is unelected*. Give it an entirely elected membership and you give it more legitimacy. Sooner or later it will push for more power from the Commons - how could it not?

&gt;Even if they did they wouldn't get them, so what makes you think they are any different from any other elected body performing a limited clearly defined role?

I don't see why they wouldn't get them. Indeed it would be pointless not to give the elected Lords more power. What clearly defined role would they perform? Is their role today clearly defined?

&gt;I would rather have two houses, elected in different ways, for different term lengths, performing distinct separate roles. That's the way it works for the majority of democracies in the world.

See... the fact that it happens in the majority of places doesn't really support your argument for two reasons. Firstly, it's important to note that the Westminster system has been copied to different degrees across the world. Some of those places have a second elected chamber because Westminster has two chambers, but a new country with a new constitution based on democracy isn't going to have a hereditary chamber so they make it elected instead. We shouldn't then just assume a second elected chamber is best because that's what some other countries have. Some of those countries have just a single elected chamber anyway. Secondly, you can't simply assume that because something is prevalent that it is good. 

&gt;Our antiquated undemocratic system is not better, and the only argument against it seems to be fear of the unknown.

Is anybody arguing for the status quo? I'm quite relaxed about FPTP and Life Peers as it happens, but I haven't mentioned that in this thread.

&gt;Having a Single house would be even worse though

Wait... it would be *worse* without the unelected, undemocratic Lords? Even though the commons is, basically, elected?

They can play the brinkmanship game as well - whilst I don't think they would be spiteful enough to do it, they can always just cut all trade with us, which will completely obliterate our economy.

I disagree that they aren't spiteful enough to do it. I think if and when the UK does leave they would happily let the people of the EU suffer for the sake of the project. That said, they wouldn't cut all trade because that would undermine them as acting in the best interest of their people even moreso than has already been demonstrated and with the UK leaving such an act would lead to the complete dissolution of the EU and they'll be desperate to prevent that after a secession has occurred. 

&gt; And as the US is tightening it ties with the EU, our bargaining chip as the intermediary between Europe and the US is diminishing rapidly.

We'll see how that goes, I doubt there will be many problems for the UK as a result of our geographic location, language and ability to negotiate freely.

&gt; Yes our trade is important to the EU, but not enough for them to bend over backwards to suit our whims.

My point entirely. WE wouldn't expect them to act against their best interests but for both us and them to mutually compromise on a deal that works better for everyone instead of only us having to make concessions because we can be vetoed. 

&gt; don't you think the EU would currently be more open towards the idea of reform in order to try and keep us in the EU?

I do think the EU should be more open to the idea of reform and am frankly surprised that they haven't been. Part of that is ideological, part of that is brinksmanship and part of that is dislike of the UK but another part of it is refusal to accept that BrExit is a very real possibility. 

&gt; From the EU perspective, it would be nice to maintain a good relationship with us, but if they can't they still have the US...

It isn't a binary option. The EU will spite the UK if we leave, I've no doubt, but this will be balanced against their own interests too. If they are lucky they'll strike the right balance between saving face, punishing the UK and retaining the EU but if they overplay their hand then the whole house of cards will come tumbling down and Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands and possibly others will queue up to leave too.

null,false,calculusprime,null,null,null,"""I welcome this opportunity to speak on this incredibly important matter of the day. We in Northern Ireland are well aware of the brutal realities of terrorism, yet the events in France last week shocked, I am sure, even the most hardened of us. The murderous attacks on the cartoonists and journalists at the Paris offices of the satirical magazine 'Charlie Hebdo' included the murder of two policemen and were followed by the murder of a policewoman and the hostage-taking and murder of four people in a kosher supermarket, also in Paris.

This trail of blood lays bare all the ingredients that make up terrorism in our age: fanaticism, intolerance, sectarianism and, above all, a complete lack of respect for human life.

I am acutely aware that we must not be selective when condemning terrorism. We remember the dreadful attack by the Taliban on the school in Peshawar, which left more than 150 people, many of them children, dead. This weekend in Nigeria, 20 people were killed by Boko Haram female suicide bombers, one of whom was reported to be just 10 years old. This comes after hundreds were reportedly killed by the same militant Islamist group last week.

Whether it is France, Pakistan or Nigeria, terrorism kills innocent people and is a threat to our civilisation.

The Paris attacks were an explicit attack on the freedom of speech, which is the central tenet of liberal democracy. We do not have to search very far for the motivation of the terrorists who struck in Paris; no one should give them any cover by talking of western foreign policy. The terrorists were explicit: they attacked a free press because, in their world view, the cartoonists insulted their religion, and the attack on the Jewish supermarket exposed their sectarian mindset. Anti-Semitism is appalling, as is the spate of attacks on mosques.

Let us, in our condemnation, be very clear: all institutions, including organised religions, should be subject to criticism and satire. 'Charlie Hebdo' ridiculed many institutions and all religions; it is part of the European tradition of satire. There is no absolute right not to be offended; that is something that we in Northern Ireland should always bear in mind. We should also remember the murderous attacks against the 'Belfast Telegraph' by the Provisional IRA, plus the attempted and actual murder of 'Sunday World' journalists by so-called loyalists. Terrorists cannot abide a free press.

A letter writer to 'The Daily Telegraph' said it very well this morning:

""We should show respect for other people, not their beliefs. These should be fully open to criticism, ridicule and opposition.""

If we believe in a free society, rather than in a theocracy of any denomination, we must defend the Enlightenment values of free speech, freedom of democracy, liberty, equality and fraternity from all others. If I can apologise for my French, we should all be saying, ""Nous sommes Charlie"", and I can certainly say, ""Je suis Charlie"", but also, ""Je suis Juif"".

Because they have a specific jurisdiction? So does the House of Lords.

&gt; I don't see why they wouldn't get them. Indeed it would be pointless not to give the elected Lords more power.

Why would it be pointless not to give them more power? Most democracies have elected upper houses that have less power than the lower houses. Do you think they are all pointless? Do you think that the current House of Lords is pointless, because it has limited power? It has the right amount of power, which is why no one is suggest that would change. Elected Lords would have no more ability to gain more powers for themselves than appointed ones do today, the House of Commons would still have primacy exactly as it does today and only the commons would have the ability additional powers to the Lords.

&gt;  Is their role today clearly defined?

Yes, it's basically a revising chamber with the power to delay or suggest amendments to legislation.

&gt;  We shouldn't then just assume a second elected chamber is best because that's what some other countries have... Secondly, you can't simply assume that because something is prevalent that it is good.

That wasn't what I was arguing at all. I was simply arguing that most democracies have elected second chambers who have limited power, very similar to the powers the Lords have today. So your argument that ""It is precisely the unelected nature of the Lords which makes it subordinate to the elected house."" has no basis fact. Elected second chambers do exist in other parts of the world, they work, they are subordinate to the lower houses, and perform different roles.

&gt; Wait... it would be worse without the unelected, undemocratic Lords? Even though the commons is, basically, elected?

Because it's not black or white, I'd rather have an unelected revising chamber than not have one at all. I actually think the House of Lords does a lot of good work, we all here agree it needs reform of some sort it seems, but it shouldn't be abolished outright.",null,0,null,1421179079,null,0,1421179639,0,cnnvi2c,null,t3_2s9kxb,null,t1_cnnvi2c,null,t1_cnntc3g,null,null,null,1424896141,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

null,false,newosis,null,null,null,"OK, so this is a bit of a complex subject but I will try and sum it up without writing a massive block of text.

Basically there are three routes you can take, one is the easy route and will give you all the advantages of being a full time employee, the other two are slightly more complex. Let's look at the simple one first:

There are companies that are set up to help people in your exact position, these are called umbrella companies (such as these guys; http://www.umbrella.co.uk/) and what happens is that you are set up as an employee of the umbrella company which then invoices the company you do the work for.

This has several advantages such as being all above board, very easy to set up and also means you will not need to complete a tax return. You will be on PAYE as an employee of the umbrella company so it's all taken care of.

This method, whilst being the easiest and simplest will mean that you pay the most in tax, so the second option is that you go as self employed. This is pretty easy as all you need to do is register as such (https://www.gov.uk/working-for-yourself/what-you-need-to-do) and then submit tax returns at the right dates.

The advantage of being self employed is that you will be able to deduct some stuff against your taxable income, which means you will likely come up on top against the umbrella company. The downside here is that most companies won't deal with sole traders / Individuals. This may not be an issue here though. To be honest I've never seen someone doing this, all my contractors are through companies be they there own or umbrellas.

OK so finally there is the most tax efficient option, but one that relies on the most leg work, creating your own company. You can create the company in about 20 minutes via the companies house website. However you will need to find an accountant pretty much from the off to help you get it all up and running.

With your own company you can deduct loads against tax as well as pay yourself a small salary, which is under the taxable allowance and then take the rest as a dividend which is subject to the much lower corporations tax :) Woop woop. However the tax man is wise to this and has invented something called IR35. Basically this states that if you could be employed by the company you work for you should, rather than be a tax dodging limited company. If it's juts one block of work you will more than likely be fine.


All in all I would say the best option would depend on how much work you intend to do for them and how much you will be paid. If it's less than 20k I really wouldn't bother with anything fancy and just go the Umbrella work. Same for if it's just a one off and not a long term thing.

From that I can only conclude that this sub is actually quite selective in its liberal values. It is happy to defend certain groups, but happy to discriminate against others. 

A comment such as ""Its the fucking Muslims"", made in any context would be immediately down voted, and quite rightly, but it seems people here do not feel the need to defend certain groups against such bigoted attacks, which itself is discriminatory. 

Doing mental gymnastics to try and defend bigoted opinions, which, no offence intended, is what you have done in your comment above, is exactly what many people on this sub accuse people who hold views they find offensive of. 

The historic influence the Church held in this country has absolutely no relation to the beliefs of everyday Christians in this country today. While Sunday trading hours may have been initially put in place because the Church had the power to insist on such things, they are still in place today because the government wishes it to be that way. To imply that the Church has enough power in this country to insist things stay this way is absurd. 

Where is your evidence public opinion being in favour of assisted dying? And sex education is compulsory in schools, so im not sure what you are implying there. While the government may seem to make decisions that reflect Christian values, it is not because the Church or Christians hold any extra power over them, it is simply that sometimes these values align with public opinion, not surprising considering how much Christianity is entwined with our culture.  

To attempt to blame them for Sunday opening hours, as if Christians had any more power or influence than every other individual in this country, is bigoted and should be treated as such.",null,0,null,1421180129,null,0,1421180856,0,cnnw7fj,null,t3_2s9vwj,null,t1_cnnw7fj,null,t1_cnnqbb1,null,null,null,1424895811,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Open seating so that if you and your mates want to come in together, you can sit together. Perhaps everything after the first ten rows (so for disabled fans and their carers, and the inevitible corportate sponsors) still get the closest seats. There would also be a greater need to get there earlier to get the best general admission seats. Thus increasing the atmosphere as some people in the video talked about. 

When I go to Anfield I always go earlier but with no one else around and loud music playing, the atmosphere doesn't build like it should. European nights everyone gets there earlier and the noise usually benefits from this. With G.A. seating you could end up with several thousand more people there an hour before the game so that they get the best available seats. 

It seems to me at least like the natural halfway point between what we have now and standing. 

Also, reducing ticket prices in the Kop would be beneficial. The whole ground needs reducing but if we start at the Kop that's a significant step forward. That's where the chants are started and if you're sitting there and ten minutes have gone by and you've spent 40 quid watching us struggle at home to Villa, singing takes a back seat. You know chants help the team but you don't want to be the one nob head singing if no one else joins in.

It's amazing though. In my last job the unions organised a strike over changes to the pension scheme (the ballot was only about 30% turnout)
About a week before I asked my colleagues in the office if they were striking. None of them actually knew the details of the pension changes or realised it would cost them several hundred pounds a year, while giving them less to retire on. When I explained it to them they were outraged, fully in support of the strike etc.
Day of the strike they had all but forgotten and went to work. Said it was too much hassle to inform our manager of their intention to strike and fill out a form. If they'd held the opinion that we shouldn't have gone on strike, fair enough, everyone's opinion is valid. It was sheer laziness though.

I don't particularly like Will Self either, but I don't think the definition of satire he uses is a bad one, in that the people have to be in a position of power. Of course groups like ISIS have power, but the byproduct of attacking Islam in general is that Muslims in the west get grouped in with all the nutters, and insulted whether they like it or not. I, like many others don't think people should be banned from expressing opinion, but found a lot of the Hebdo cartoons childish and in bad taste.

&gt;Why would it be pointless not to give them more power? Most democracies have elected upper houses that have less power than the lower houses. Do you think they are all pointless?

They're pointless if they have as much power as the House of Lords does today, but chances are they have more power than the House of Lords does today, because... they are elected. Also worth mentioning most countries have a fixed constitution which enshrines in law the powers of the institutions. We have a fluid constitution based on consent and convention - you can bet your ass an elected House of Lords would seek new conventions with its new legitimacy.

&gt;Do you think that the current House of Lords is pointless, because it has limited power?

I think electing Lords to the position as it is now would be a pointless exercise in dummy-democracy. Voting people into a position of non-power.

&gt;It has the right amount of power, which is why no one is suggest that would change.

It has the right amount of power for an unelected body. If it were elected, it would seek more power with its increased legitimacy. This is what political bodies do. As I said in the paragraph you didn't respond to.

&gt;Elected Lords would have no more ability to gain more powers for themselves than appointed ones do today the House of Commons would still have primacy exactly as it does today and only the commons would have the ability additional powers to the Lords.

How do you know that? Because you haven't heard someone say it before?

&gt;Yes, it's basically a revising chamber with the power to delay or suggest amendments to legislation.

Would you like it to keep this role? I believe in order to keep this role, it needs to be unelected. I also don't believe it is a sufficiently powerful body to warrant being elected - Ofcom is probably more powerful, but you wouldn't elect them (you wouldn't appoint them for life either, granted, but I'd prefer the system I mentioned in an above post).

&gt;That wasn't what I was arguing at all. I was simply arguing that most democracies have elected second chambers who have limited power, very similar to the powers the Lords have today. So your argument that ""It is precisely the unelected nature of the Lords which makes it subordinate to the elected house."" has no basis fact.

It requires a static constitution - the British constitution is particular in this. We are talking about the British Parliament. In places where movement is fluid, power shifts to local authorities from Parliament (no constitution prevents this) and from the Commission to the European Parliament (the ongoing treaty process for federalization of the EU allows this).

Changing the British constitution to allow for an elected House of Lords would quickly bring up further problems regarding its new role, which it would have to evolve into *even if some kind of purpose was stated beforehand*. What makes more sense is to keep it unelected, and have it populated by qualified professionals who can offer actual expert guidance rather than senior politicians (who do have a role to play).

&gt;Because it's not black or white, I'd rather have an unelected revising chamber than not have one at all. I actually think the House of Lords does a lot of good work, we all here agree it needs reform of some sort it seems, but it shouldn't be abolished outright.

Which company, out of interest? PM if you'd prefer.

&gt;1) Is union membership essential, and what advantages does it actually buy me? 

Not 'essential' per se, but I strongly recommend ALL employees of ANY company or civil service join a Trade Union.

Unfortunately so many don't join until they need the Union's help. If EVERYONE did this, the Union would not survive financially. 

Benefits could include:

*Collective bargaining: the Union negotiates on behalf of all employees
 
*Representation by and support from a TRAINED and EXPERIENCED person at any disciplinary hearings, grievance cases, Bullying/Harassment cases, etc.
 
*Legal cover: need the advice of a Solicitor for a dispute with your employer? The Union will likely cover the cost (you may require a 'gold' membership or whatever they call it...at extra £2 per month or something)
 
*The moral comfort that you and your colleagues are supporting each other by being members of the Trade Union. /_A Union is only as strong as the number of members it has_/.

&gt;Will I be seen as a scab if i don't join, for example? 

Almost certainly not. This is a VERY outdated view. Now if your Union members vota to go on strike, and you - as a member - refuse to walk out with your colleagues, then yes; expect to at the VERY least be given the cold shoulder by your colleagues. Companies are clamping down on this though, as they see it as Bullying.

&gt;Should I look at joining up immediately or is this something I can figure out later? 

As soon as practically possible. Keep your eyes open during your first coupleof weeks; you may well see a ""Union Noticeboard"" in the canteen/rest area. Failing that, ask a friendly colleague.

&gt;2) How do I decide which one to join? I believe there is a very obvious choice which is the PCS, but there are various minority unions represented as well. How do I weigh up which one to join?

I'm 99.9% sure that a single particular Union will be 'recognised' by your employer. 'Recognised' in this sense is both a literal term and a legal term. Basically your employer sees the Union as the sole Trade Union that represents it's employers.

If you really really can't find out, the TUC (Trade Union's Congress) website has a nifty tool that tells you. 

 
&gt;3) Do I have to declare my membership to my line management, etc?

Not AFAIK (99% sure), but in the event of a strike, I /_think_/ the Union has to give the company a list. Not sure though.

&gt;4) How much does it cost?

Ibuprofen is recommended for dental pain, but if that's not working, you have bleeding that won't stop, or swelling that's getting worse, contact the emergency dentist by calling 111. EMERGENCY DENTAL TREATMENT IS TEMPORARY, you will still need to see a regular dentist.

In the meantime, and I know this from personal experience (recent and recurring infected wisdom tooth), the temptation when you've got a pain is not to brush properly. That only makes it worse. Get a soft manual toothbrush and brush carefully, taking your time. A saltwater mouthwash can help with any pain caused by inflammation of your gums; Corsodyl and similar will make the discolouration worse.

Don't worry about how it looks for now, just worry about having a healthy mouth, which will be subsidised by the NHS. After that you can think about cosmetic things like discolouration. Nobody is going to do anything to your mouth without discussing it, and the cost, with you in advance. If they don't, it is a bad dentist and you should get yourself on a waiting list somewhere else.

My GP said I was fulfilling my responsibilities, and that Willis were burdening the surgery and NHS so they had to take full responsibility.

Willis did ask me to do it myself, so I told HR what my GP had said, and that I would take it to citizens advice. They immediately backed down and took on the responsibility.

Then there's the petition against certain pesticides, which got 2.6 million signatures and caused the EU to impose a ban on them: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/ccd-european-ban.html

Then there was the petition against the Bank of America introducing the $5 monthly banking fee. 300,000 signatures, it was scrapped within a month: http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-bank-of-america-no-5-debit-card-fees

Also 2,000,000 people signed the petition to free a rape victim in the Maldives who was jailed for having sex outside of a marriage: http://www.avaaz.org/en/maldives_global/ resulting in her conviction being overturned.

By doing a near 180 on their economic policies and cutting much slower... like labour said they would.

It's annoying that people will think the Torys turned around the economy when their policies led us straight into a near triple dip recession until they changed them to be like labours. It's also extremely odd that people blame labour for the recessions... they literally said 'If the bank fails we'll give you your money back, no need to withdraw it' and tried to stop the spread.

That is to say, the vast majority of people will be completely unaffected by this, but if suspected/accused terrorists are found to have used an end-to-end strongly encrypted communications service at some point, then they will also be charged with whatever new law prohibits such communication. This will probably end up extending to other classes of the accused where collusion is suspected, and encryption has been used. Gang-related crimes, paedophile rings, and so on.

In parallel, online communications services will be compelled by law to build backdoors into their systems, in a way reminiscent of the USA's [Clipper chip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip) proposal during the 1990s. Though as Snowden has suggested with his leaks, this has probably already happened in secret anyway. So some of this will be to legalise what the secret services are already doing in the dark.

All in all, this won't make any difference whatsoever to most people's everyday lives, and may help slightly to solve crimes. However, it will also occasionally adversely affect those innocent of crimes who happen to be suspected and can't prove that their use of encryption was not criminal. And if we are ever governed by truly malevolent, totalitarian powers, then this will be a fantastic resource to help them punish a whole new set of dissidents.",null,0,null,1421184393,null,0,false,0,cnnz43x,null,t3_2sabfc,null,t1_cnnz43x,null,t3_2sabfc,null,null,null,1424894455,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,chrisjd,null,null,null,"Wow, honestly I don't think you know enough about the current House of Lords to have a meaningful discussion. Do you honestly think that a house that defeated the previous government hundreds of times, has defeated this government nearly a hundred times, and has forced through some significant amendments to important legislation, the Health and Social Care act being a recent example, has less power than Offcom? So little power that it's not in worth electing it?

And when you say stuff like this:

&gt;&gt; Elected Lords would have no more ability to gain more powers for themselves than appointed ones do today the House of Commons would still have primacy exactly as it does today and only the commons would have the ability additional powers to the Lords.

&gt;How do you know that? Because you haven't heard someone say it before?

You are the one suggesting the Lords might seize power if they became elected. The onus on you to suggest the process that this might happen. They don't have the power to pass laws to give themselves more power, so if your concerns are anything more than fear-mongering or paranoia please do tell me, how exactly will they play out? Suggesting the Lords/Senate will grab more power for themselves is exactly as ridiculous as suggesting a local council might try and seize absolute power of their local area and start ignoring central government. Just because they would be elected does not magically give them the right, the means, or even the motivation to start grabbing powers over and above the role they have been elected to.

But since you asked

&gt;If it does good work, why should it be elected?

* Because it would give more power to smaller parties and lead to better debates with a more diverse range of opinions. It would likely be elected using a more proportional method, giving a voice to parties that locked out of the Commons due to FPTP (and reform of the house of commons voting system is off the table for a generation, so this is the only chance we're going to get of having at least one house being more representative of the way people vote).
* Because it would spread power out more evenly across the regions, currently most Lords come from London
* Because it would weaken the power of party donors, who wouldn't be able to be rewarded with peerages for cash
* Importantly, because that is what people want. Polls consistently show have an elected house of Lords is overwhelming popular. People don't want to live with an antiquated, undemocratic system. They want to live in a legitimate democracy, where every level of government is elected. The government passing such a popular reform may well increase peoples interest and engagement with politics, which can only be a good thing. The House of Lords could be transformed into a vibrant debating chamber, where people can watch their elected representatives pour over the detail of legislation and debate the pros and cons. Right now it's more like a retirement home for ex-MPs and party donors, where it's hard to tell if most of them are asleep or have just finally snuffed it. Despite the good work the Lords does do, it could be made so much better, it crying out for reform and making it elected is what the people overwhelmingly want.

Finally, the Lords is already party political, most Lords are loyal to a party, and the House of Lords desperately needs reform, we have the only legislature in the world where the upper house is larger than the lower house due to successive Prime Ministers trying to pack it full of Lords loyal to them. This is the only significant reform currently being considered is to make the House elected, and it's the only one likely to be considered in the near future. So why shouldn't it be elected, other than your paranoia about the Lords suddenly grabbing themselves more power once they get elected, which is just silly, what argument have you got against elections? Especially since, according to you, the Lords have an insignificant amount of power anyway, you do you want to deny people the right to elect them? Your ideal of a Technocratic house wouldn't work, qualified professionals are only qualified in one area, so they'd still be unqualified to vote on most legislation, plus they have no particular reason to act in the best interests of the public, plus it gives a huge amount of power to the bodies who get's to choose who get's appointed. Better to have an elected upper house that people can hold to account, Democracy is proven to be the least bad system of government, it's about time we had a proper one.

Edit: Here's an example poll about House of Lords reform if you're interested:

I don't have any doubt he's really fond of the club but the simple fact is that Southampton FC isn't a team that many kids grow up watching and dreaming of playing for, especially not in France. 

Champions League combined with how much he likes us is the only thing that might make him stay another season.

Narrated by Ali ibn AbuTalib

When Ali described the Prophet (peace be upon him) he said:

He was neither very tall nor excessively short, but was a man of medium size. He had neither very curly nor flowing hair but a mixture of both.

He was not obese, he did not have a very round face, but it was so to some extent.

He was reddish-white, he had wide black eyes and long eyelashes.

He had protruding joints and shoulder-blades, he was not hairy but had some hair on his chest, and the palms of his hands and his feet were calloused.

His plan is exactly that.

Stage 1:

* Spend a fuckton on cycling infrastructure
* Make it so noone can park anywhere
* Narrow roadways/ make driving awkward

Stage 2:

* Everyone now realises they never need to drive anywhere and bristol is a car free city.


Important things George doesn't understand:

* For people to ditch cars they have to have more than one alternative and the bus system certainly isn't anywhere near up to scratch. 
* People still need to be able to drive through the city to get to work elsewhere.
* Equal money must be spent on both cycling and motor infrastructure.


Bristol is a small city that is extremely easy to get around... in the centre... if you only need to go to the centre and not north to south.
The rest of the city (read: the more residential zones) is more spread out and difficult to get exactly where you want to go without a car (due to congestion and poor public transport reliability and routes).

null,false,tusksrus,null,null,null,"&gt;You are the one suggesting the Lords might seize power if they became elected. The onus on you to suggest the process that this might happen.

Okay.

House of Lords: Here, we're elected but have virtually no power. Can we at least repeal the bit of the Parliament Act that says the Commons can bypass our decisions? We've put a bill through for you to debate.

House of Commons: Well, none of us can think of a good enough reason to say no.

And from there the fundamental difference is broken, and rightly so, given the now elected nature of the Lords. Better to just scrap it than dilute political power and talent and create a constitutional headache for... for what? So people on /r/europe won't make fun of us for having an unelected house? They'll only go on about Twitter arrests more.

[edit: This is made more likely when the House of Lords is elected proportionally - they will see themselves as the *more democratic house with less power*.]

I'm not saying they will *seize* power, I'm saying they will request to become a more powerful body than they currently are now - and the Commons will rightly consent to that. The process will repeat itself *because political bodies are always seeking more power for themselves*.

Eventually it will reach a point where the Commons doesn't want to give more power to the Lords because the Commons wants to remain supreme. However by this point the Lords is causing too much trouble for the Commons (since it can without the Parliament Act protocol) that it's inevitable. The fluid nature of our constitution fucks us over due to lack of foresight about how human nature will play a role in having two competing elected bodies.


&gt;Because it would give more power to smaller parties and lead to better debates with a more diverse range of opinions. It would likely be elected using a more proportional method, giving a voice to parties that locked out of the Commons due to FPTP (and reform of the house of commons voting system is off the table for a generation, so

So. If smaller parties want more representation, they should be more popular. FPTP is a whole other debate (guess what - we disagree on that too. But you and I already had that discussion about a month ago and it's off-topic). The fact that FPTP is staying for this generation doesn't mean we need to radically reform a constitutional body, breaking the structure of Parliament, as a sort of second prize. Just campaign harder next time reform is on the table, and send out leaflets for the Greens and UKIP next May.

&gt;Because it would spread power out more evenly across the regions, currently most Lords come from London

This can be more easily solved by appointing Lords not from London.

&gt;Because it would weaken the power of party donors, who wouldn't be able to be rewarded with peerages for cash

State funding of parties would do an even better job - again, constitutional change to an otherwise unrelated body is not required for an issue like this. I don't see this making a dent anyway - they'll just get some other honour.

&gt;Importantly, because that is what people want.

Granted, this is a decent reason. But I think people believe the false dichotomy between the status quo and an elected Lords; that it is the only alternative. I also happen to disagree with most people about this. The fact most people want something doesn't, in fact, make it a good idea. This comes back to the prevalence is good fallacy. It's also boring a boring and anti-discussion point to make, to just point out most people (who probably haven't thought much about the issue) agree with you. That just means I have my work cut out to convince people - I already knew this.

&gt;Finally, the Lords is already party political, most Lords are loyal to a party

My proposal would change that, yours wouldn't.

&gt;So why shouldn't it be elected

I explained this - you seem to think I'm saying there will be a coup. I'm not. I simply believe that it's how things will go given the nature of our constitution and the nature of human beings and the nature of political bodies.

&gt;what argument have you got against elections?

Oh... you don't want to go down there with me. ;) I *like* elections - in principle. But people nowadays have a strange and very literal interpretation of democracy - that it somehow means that the people should always get what they want. To me, democracy is about a free society and the ability to depose the leaders through organized and peaceful means. Lords aren't leaders, or particularly powerful.


&gt;Your ideal of a Technocratic house wouldn't work, qualified professionals are only qualified in one area, so they'd still be unqualified to vote on most legislation

Yes... so only those qualified to vote would, by convention. It's like in the Council of Ministers at the EU - that's sort of the upper chamber there. There, finance ministers discuss and vote on financial matters, for example. 

&gt;plus they have no particular reason to act in the best interests of the public

Does Ofcom?

&gt; plus it gives a huge amount of power to the bodies who get's to choose who get's appointed

Eh... how huge? The Lords isn't massively powerful. It'd only give huge amounts of power if we made them elected first, then appointed through my proposal. ;)

&gt; Better to have an elected upper house that people can hold to account, Democracy is proven to be the least bad system of government, it's about time we had a proper one.

We could just get rid of the Lords - that's an option.

Edit:

&gt;69% support a half, majority or wholly elected second chamber. The most popular response was for a fully elected second chamber (33%). Just 5% support a wholly appointed second chamber.

I've been watching since 1984 from the PBS days on KCET, it's my favorite show of all time, and I absolutely and totally loathe what it's become.  I loved Matt and Karen. I loved Blink.  I was so excited for the show when Moffat became the show runner and the direction he was taking it. But then it became a confusing incomprehensible mess with River's timeline.  After that - the worst blow for me - Moffat shoehorned his own ""Doctor"" into the mythos.  What an incredible cheat that was.  And, oh yeah, Tenant regenerated twice.  Then Smith - is he number 11 or 12 now? I'm honestly not even sure how to refer to him now - well, he got really old but thankfully a bunch more lives came through a crack in the sky, so he's okay now.  Then he regenerated into a supporting character in his own show.  I think Capaldi could have been a great Doctor, but I'm so biased by how shitty the show has become from what it was when Smith started.  Lazy writing from a show runner who wants to piss all over the material to make his mark instead of serve the characters and the show itself.  I will always watch it, I will always support it - but it just makes me sad now.

null,false,lunarman_dod,null,null,null,"I think the ""Alpha"" part of ""The Alpha Course"" comes from God saying, ""I am the alpha and the omega"". As in, ""I am the beginning and the end"". 
So, the Alpha Course is called ""The Alpha Course"" because it's the *beginning* of a journey to find out about God. 

I'm not really sure if the Alpha Church you're speaking about is the same thing as The Alpha Course, because the alpha course really isn't a church at all. There's no worship, there's no singing, there's no prayer. It's not intended for people who believe that God exists, it's for atheists, agnostics, people of all faiths (even Christians too). We just tea and cake and sitting around asking about life's big mysteries.
 
As far as I am aware, most cults involve huge personal sacrifice, endless donations, indoctrinations into a belief system, a loss of individuality, turning you against your friends... need I go on?? I don't think any churches/mosques/synagogues in this city promote that sort of religion at all!!!!!

Anyway, in general I am aware that most people seem to regard all religion as a bit cult-ish. I really don't get why, but I guess these modern times have shifted life's focus to *materialism*, *personal success* and *living for the moment*. So, any group of people who go around say ""give lots of money to the poor"", ""revel in your friends'/rivals' successes"" and ""think about the long term consequences of your actions"" must seem pretty mad... But honestly, I think people would be surprised if they went to achurch (ok, maybe not Christchurch, I hear it's pretty funky!). They'd find that nearly everyone there is really normal, and uber-friendly. 

Anyway, we had the first session of the course tonight: about 15 folks turned up in total. We talked about lots of stuff, just discussing opinions. For example 

* ""does religion matter, or is it just a way of looking at the world?""
* ""is life meaningless without a god, or can you find purpose?""
* ""why do people seem to struggle to find a purpose""
* ""what really bothers you about Christianity?""
* ""what do you hope is true/not true out of the claims that Christianity makes?""
* general science vs religion stuff (and how they're totally compatible)

&gt;His proposed legislation [...] would provide a new legal framework for Britain’s GCHQ and other intelligence agencies to crack the communications of terror suspects if there was specific intelligence of an imminent attack

'Communications' is potentially vague in its implications.

People do seem to be slightly conflating what Cameron said with what Andrew Parker, director-general of MI5 said [here](https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/who-we-are/staff-and-management/director-general/speeches-by-the-director-general/director-generals-speech-on-terrorism-technology-and-accountability.html). Specifically, he says that terrorists use the internet

&gt;to spread propaganda, to radicalise impressionable individuals, *to arrange travel, to move money*. But most of all to communicate with one another, to plan and organise [my italics]

Labour had a financial services sector (one of the only things were good at) that rained tax revenues down on the economy and enabled massive public spending. We don't have that anymore so our economy is not generating much tax revenue (there are even people who want to make this worse by capping banker pay). 

These are all uncomfortable truths the left has no answer to. We've seen first hand what happens when a lurch to the left occurs. Its happening in France and Italy right now. If you think things are bad here they are far worse there. 

The saddest thing is that the left has convinced the more vulnerable in society that they can fix it all by spending and more spending when the reality is that if we do that the economy will tank and unemployment will sky rocket. And as we've recently seen a recession hurts the most vulnerable the most. So the left will end up hurting the people they have convinced to vote for them. They will of course never admit this and it will be evil Tories and bankers who are to blame.

null,false,G_Comstock,null,null,null,"I think you are 100% right to pick out keeping unemployment low as an area where the Coalition government has presided over a massive win. 

Clearly we can discuss some of the less than desirable aspects of that maintenance (zero hour contracts, increased proportion of 'under' emplyed part time workers) but it is a remarkable achievement nonetheless.

However what is discussed less is the sheer length on the recession/sluggish growth that was also presided over. If in 2010 any party had seriously suggested that it would take 3 1/2 years for the economy to stop being anemic there would have been gasps. 

In that respect at least Britian compares much less favorably with Europe and is very much part of the dunces class with the Iberians and Italians. Coalition economic policy (i.e. cutting ones way out of a recession) clearly exacerbated the economic cycle in this regard.

The reason I bring this up is because I feel we the electorate often compare a static economic situation in the run up to an election. i.e. how do our current growth projections compare with the rest of Eurpe/OECD. Based on that and other metrics we then conclude whether the incumbents have done a good or bad job. On the face of it this is reasonable but it ignores the fact that governments pull on any available economic lever to try and ensure as rosy a looking economic picture as possible in the run up to an election. Its the economy stupid is a lesson out politicians have learnt very well. Indeed its not unreasonable to talk about the economic policy deployed across a governmental term being explicitly aimed at ensuring the pre-election rosy outlook. 

It seems to me much more prudent of us as an electorate to compare the counties economic performance over the course of the entire term against expectations and benchmark countries. 

An analogy I dislike but cant improve upon is that of a shareholder. If come the hypothetical bi-decennial AGM a companies executive team presented encouraging quarterly numbers and good yearly projections the shareholders would nonetheless be remiss if they suddenly forgot about the previous four years of zero dividends and underwhelming numbers.",null,0,null,1421189419,null,0,false,0,cno2fze,null,t3_2sabfc,null,t1_cno2fze,null,t1_cnny9l2,null,null,null,1424892773,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Fight no matter how hard it may seem! Joel was fucking phenomenal(accidental Roberto) and with his form lately Howard isn't walking back into the team which is good. I've always called for him to be given a run of games and then judge him and I think he's proven why Roberto has put his faith in him. With the comments Roberto made about replacing the goalkeeper with someone more long term it's obvious he wants to replace Howard and not Joel. I honestly can't say that any of the players who finished the match played badly at all. Everyone was top class and it was just unlucky for us really.

 It has to be said though McGeady was an absolute fool for his sending off especially as he was having one of the best games in an Everton shirt in the first half. Barkley is also very strange he's not been the player he should be recently at all and I don't know if it's because of his position or something else but it needs to be sorted. Also quick side note how did Besic get taken off but Barry didn't? Seems a more logical choice to keep the vastly younger more influencing player on in my opinion.

 But aside from that great performance obviously I'm disappointed in the way it went especially with Joel missing the penalty which he didn't deserve to do because of how well he played and the result but the players can hold their heads high after that performance, we may not have won but it sure as shit doesn't feel like we lost!

You could have multiple of these, and the algorithm can figure out whether it's even possible, or to fulfil the sub schedules with some slack on certain services, prioritised to whichever sub-schedules the operators of the service see fit. (For instance, fast trains should take priority over slow trains, unless the slow trains will be delayed by more than 10 minutes, or something like that.)

Feed in real time data and this can be constantly recalculated and train departures/arrivals/time spent sitting on tracks stopped can be moved within slack periods to make sure that trains that need to pass each other or use the same lines for a while, can do, and that everything runs as closely to schedule as is mathematically possible (within the defined tolerance/slack).

I hope that makes sense, it's been a while since I've thought about this in detail.

Basically, if you define a service level, you can have computers adhere to it as closely as is actually possible and take away the uncertainty of humans getting it wrong sometimes. Or you can use it as a computer aid as one of the subways in a large global city does, for scheduling repair works overnight (I forget which subway this is... sorry)",null,0,null,1421189843,null,0,1421190080,0,cno2q61,null,t3_2s64n7,null,t1_cno2q61,null,t1_cno1vkt,null,null,null,1424892641,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What is the price range of the flats earning £650-£750PM? £110,000-£120,000?

The biggest cost you can offset is the mortgage interest (but not the capital) which is why so many landlords choose interest only. Examples of costs that you deduct: https://www.gov.uk/renting-out-a-property/paying-tax 

Assuming £115,000 price and £700pm rent you'd have a gross yield of 7.3%. £8400 gross rent. 

Minus say £3300 in mortgage interest, minus £1200 in service charge and ground rent, minus landlord insurance £180 etc. Leaving you with £4680 taxable. You'd keep 80%. So £3744. 

If you put down a 25% deposit on £115,000 so £28750 and was left with £3744 a year your geared return after expenses and tax is 13%.

Apparently that meeting wasn't enough to determine that I wasn't homosexual and so I received a phone call telling me that somebody was going to pop round to my house for yet another meeting.

I let this woman in and we're both sitting on the couch when she asks if I'm in a homosexual relationship with my housemate. I said no.

There's one less competition for us to get distracted and tired by. Yes, it would have been wonderful to win the cup, but we have enough to do in the league and Europe.

And my god, did we show fight today. We didn't give up, and we need to keep that going against West Brom.

The club let him go by either not offering a deal or offering a poor one. And how do you know Chelsea were not told of every offer Lampard had?

Nobody bar the club and Lampard knows the full extent of why he left, but he did and **the club let him go**. The fact remains if a deal we offered him was suitable enough, he would have stayed. It is quite apparent that was not the case, regardless of where he would potentially end up.

You think the club were not aware that if a player of Lampards status becomes available, for free, that there is the possibility of a big club would want him? They knew the risks by not offering a good enough deal, that's what happens with top players.

Firstly, that the people chilled in the Charlie Hebdo attack were somehow just as susceptible to the restrictions that Islam places on its' followers. 

Secondly, that a cartoon mocking a system of belief that is required to portray itself as a free choice that all its' members make, with no hint of indoctrination, is equivalent to mocking someone for something they cannot at all choose.

Thirdly, that discussing an issue in a manner meant to provoke discussion and debate and deliberately setting out to piss off as many people as possible are equivalent.

Perhaps Mister Hasan would like to explain why he believes that non-Muslims must conform to Muslim theocratic doctrine in regards to artistic portrayal of his, not our, prophet. Or perhaps he would care to explain why in one sentence he seems to be willing to permit all speech when he knows full well that such would never be permitted by precisely those like the two brothers that committed these atrocities in the first place.

The Charlie Hebdo saga is significant not because people died violent, bloody deaths for the sake of some scribbles on paper. It is significant because it is yet another stark, brutal reminder that some people are just straight-up fucking lunatics and they will fuck you up sideways if you so much as blink wrong.

I agree that freedom of speech does have its' hypocrisies and its' nuances, but that is precisely what makes it so valuable.

Some of these laws aren't just there for fun - they're actually to protect others and make sure that idiots don't hurt people. Sure we *could* all do 150mph on motorways (provided our cars allow it) but limiting that helps lower the chances or severity of an accident. 

Sure cyclists *could* try and thread their way through crowds of pedestrians at speed, but the law says they can't to help lower the chances or severity of an accident. 

It's an open and shut case I'm afraid. The police should be reported to their local branch. Your own anecdotes about dangerous drivers are irrelevant.

Both have spots looking south with a tremendous panorama of the city skyline (linked above), and both are big enough to make finding a quiet spot likely. The Botanics also has lots of other lovely spots, including some great indoor hot houses in case the weather isn't good for an outdoor proposal.

null,false,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmkay,eng-lancashire,"Blackpool, Lancashire",null,"I understand that some cyclists are dickheads, and frankly I agree. I see both types; the bad ones and the good ones. The good ones know that pedestrians and drivers are just as much of a person as they are. Personally, I try my best to follow the rules of the road, never undertaking at high speed (if it's at a junction and I have room to, I will, but if the light is green, I wait until the cars are moving before I do), and never go fast on pavements.

Then I see cyclists who constantly jump red lights, swerve in and out of cars and pedestrians. It reminds me of why we have these rules, but I would appreciate councils doing more to have cyclists have their own way of getting around; cycle paths. Getting cyclists who jump red lights, constantly speed on pavements out of the way would benefit everyone greatly. I have always been vigilant about pedestrians and drivers, and I think it's unfair that as a whole cyclists get slated for something that other cyclists do.

I think we need information to be spread about just how to behave on bikes. I hate the cyclists who don't follow the rules and are dangerous, just as much as I hate verbally/physically abusive pedestrians and aggressive drivers.

I don't think they should be reported; they were behaving properly. I did recently see a policeman in a patrol car on the phone inching his way into a bike box; which by the highway code is actually illegal, you can only be in this box if you couldn't help it prior to approaching the lights, otherwise it is exclusive to cyclists. I couldn't do anything about reporting him at the time, as I had no phone.

I would rather cyclists didn't ride on the pavements (aggressively) unless they couldn't help it (icy roads, I have had a wipeout before going at a slow speed, it's not fun, and heavy winds make it severely dangerous because I get pushed around by the wind as well).

Instead of, ""You WILL be fined if you are cycling on the pavement"", it should be ""You WILL be fined if you are aggressively cycling on the pavement"".

I understand speed limits. The green party wants to impose a 20mph limit on most roads, I would be very happy with this, as it stops drivers being so fast. It would make me feel safer, very safe, on the road.

&gt; Then I see cyclists who constantly jump red lights, swerve in and out of cars and pedestrians. It reminds me of why we have these rules, but I would appreciate councils doing more to have cyclists have their own way of getting around; cycle paths. Getting cyclists who jump red lights, constantly speed on pavements out of the way would benefit everyone greatly. I have always been vigilant about pedestrians and drivers, and I think it's unfair that as a whole cyclists get slated for something that other cyclists do.

I completely agree - with the solution too - but would point out that motorists as a whole also do get slated (by some cyclists) for something that only some motorists do. There are more motorists though - so perhaps it compounds the issue. 

&gt; I think we need information to be spread about just how to behave on bikes. I hate the cyclists who don't follow the rules and are dangerous, just as much as I hate verbally/physically abusive pedestrians and aggressive drivers.

Agreed again. We teach people to drive - but not how to think of other drivers. We don't teach cyclists *anything* and whilst that doesn't necessarily promise bad cyclists, it doesn't help. 

&gt; Instead of, ""You WILL be fined if you are cycling on the pavement"", it should be ""You WILL be fined if you are aggressively cycling on the pavement"".

That works, but speeds would have to be minimal, especially on streets with shops etc. where people coming out might not see a cyclist (and visa versa). 

&gt; I understand speed limits. The green party wants to impose a 20mph limit on most roads, I would be very happy with this, as it stops drivers being so fast. It would make me feel safer, very safe, on the road. 

I think that depends entirely on the road. Some are naturally badly designed and separate cycling infrastructure would remove the need almost all together. I don't think universal 20mph speeds would be a good idea, it'd probably cause more problems than it fixes.

I imagine there are bike lesson places out there; but maybe a government subsidised plan for discounted lessons for people buying 16"" or bigger bikes. These tend to be adult bikes (my SO is 18, nearly 19, she got a 16"" bike, I have a 20"" though I should be riding 18"")) so we could do that. Or just have it apply to all types of bikes.

I do believe driving instructors, though I've never had driving lessons and have asked my friend who does drive on tips for being on the road and has helped me be way more confident as a cyclist on the road, have been telling their learners how to look out for cars. I think it should be emphasised that we also need to lookout for cyclists. I believe this is already in place for motorbikes and the like.

Speed limits I think should be applied in towns/cities. 30mph for less dense areas but 20 in dense areas. In Blackpool at least, 20 in the dense area wouldn't create a traffic jam. I would suspect that in London it would, as I hear it already has such problems anyway.

Our council has been improving some roads but in my opinion do not care at all for cyclists. I think they redid a junction and took out the cycle box, I don't remember which one, but I'm sure it used to have one.

I would say 5 or 10mph (to round the numbers up) would be good for cyclists on pavements. Only for those that may be young. I do think that, just as aggressive drivers can be fined and had their license taken away, that aggressive cyclists should be told off, rather than the whole lot.

Saying that, I have gone past various police on patrol, cars and on foot, and they've never said anything. I did go fast on a pavement once, by accident, and I was stopped by a policeman. He was very justified in that action. That was before I rode on the road, and I am a wiser person, despite being 20.

Thank you again for replying &lt;3

I'm sad the thread is getting downvoted, I think more people should speak their opinions.

Oh and before I forget to comment on it; I also do agree we have great drivers. Many times I wish I could thank drivers for not driving into the cycle box, or blocking me from going past them when the lights are red and I can go as close as I can to the front. Sometimes people block me and it's a cycle path. It's not allowed to my knowledge. But they are sort-of 50/50 for these things in Blackpool.

Yep. After my final meeting in the jobcentre about it, it lasted around an hour whilst various people came into the room to ask me the same old questions.. How did we know each other (he was a friend of my girlfriend and was looking at being evicted if he didn't find another tenant) and where did we meet (I was spending most of my nights at the girlfriends parents place due to working in Middlesbrough and living in Newcastle). 

I think what done it for them was that the club I was previously working at was formerly the largest gay venue in Middlesbrough (cassidys for anyone familiar), however it was taken over by a bloke that manages the players bars in Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield and he turned it into a DnB nightclub. 

What can you really do to prove that you're not gay without having to invite your girlfriend around and put on a show in front of the woman appointed to determine whether you are or not?

They ended up just dropping it without telling me anything more and I didn't bother bringing it up again.

That final meeting was arranged around 20 minutes before my signing on time. It ran over by about 40 minutes and so afterwards I popped downstairs to see my advisor about signing on. She asked why I was so late for it and I explained to her where I was and why I was held up. She was equally, if not more disgusted as anybody would have been at having to go through that.

General comment - **look over your shoulders before you move off - every time**. Even though you're not on the road, you *WILL* get minors for not doing this, although I don't think they can fail you for it.

Moving the bike - Just move it straight out of the space to avoid hitting the cones, manouvre the bike into position and straight into the other space, again, just avoid hitting the cones.

Slalom &amp; Figure of 8 - This is the cause of most fails which I have witnessed personally. Don't go too fast, don't look directly at the cones, cover your back brake and grip the tank with your knees to take weight off the bars. If you do all of this, it's hard to fail. I'd probably practice this element the most.

Slow Ride - I worried about this in case the DSA guy didn't start walking fast enough, don't worry he'll start striding pretty fast. I expect his walking pace to be about 4-5mph, if you have a bike with a digital speedometer, practice riding at these speeds in a straight line. Shouldn't be too hard. Just cover the rear brake as usual.

U-Turn - This should also be called the ""don't look at the painted line"" turn. Use the clutch to control your speed as you turn, if you feel like you're about to go down, let the clutch out slightly and cover the rear brake so you don't go too fast. Make absolutely sure to do a proper lifesaver when you move off, then a second extended one when you actually make the turn. If you forget these looks, you'll fail.

Controlled brake - No speed requirement for this run, but do try and get to the required 50km/h speeds so you get a feel for it. Just simply stop the bike with the front wheel between the cones. Try and get as central as possible. Ask afterwards what your speed was, so you know if you need to speed up/down for the emergency stop/swerve.

Emergency stop - Don't over-do the back brake. Just use it enough that it's doing something, most of the braking here should be done with the front. Don't slam it on either, do it progressively. It doesn't have to be some crazy fast emergency stop, it just has to be relatively quick. You know when you get caught by a light and slow down really really fast for it? Like that.

Swerve - Use your body weight to help move the bike and hang on with your knees, again taking weight off the bars will allow the bike and suspension to work better. Try not to take the inside line either - the most common fail here is footpegs/boots knocking over a cone.",null,0,null,1421193464,null,0,false,0,cno4vtr,null,t3_2sbvw3,null,t1_cno4vtr,null,t3_2sbvw3,null,null,null,1424891534,null,10,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,10,null

Or take the number of people in the UK killed in the past decade by Terrorists, and then the number of people in the UK killed in the past decade by obesity and inactivity, and consider that terror can introduce massive legislative changes while obesity introduces almost none at all despite being far more lethal by a ludicrously huge factor.

Surely Terrorism is just the risk of living in a free society, like any other risk, and is actually a minor risk. It needs to be actively policed, but surely not to the point of losing key aspects our society? 

It's like reacting to a plane crash by making us all take boats again, despite planes being incredibly safe. It makes me buy in to the hidden agenda ideas because of just how stupid it is.

For example, an [American study](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818?print=1) shows that even outside America terrorism is a lower risk for US citizens than many other causes, but check out the main quote and consider many of the deaths were journalists and aid workers in war zones:

&gt;There were just 25 U.S. noncombatant fatalities from terrorism worldwide. (The US government definition of terrorism excludes attacks on U.S. military personnel).

I agree.

For the most part cyclists don't feel safe on the road. This is as a result of a either small minority of massively dangerous motorists or shocking road design. Both of these have a massive negative effect on cyclists. 


As a result of this cyclists are often split into two groups - fast and confident is one, and slow, passive and scared is the other.

The 1st group is not a concern. But the 2nd is, and it's unfair that they should feel the way they do. And unfortunately they will (and I personally recommend they do) use the pavement to avoid the very real danger that persists on our roads.

Still a bit hard when the wind coming down streets on your sides actually pushes you to the curb, they are shockingly strong forces.

And I'm glad police are quite lax about it. I just see it as ""If you're not a dick you're cool. If you are a dick, you're dead meat"". Police are very chill in the UK thank god. I do wish we'd report aggressive drivers against cyclists and the cyclists who are aggressive and run red lights.

I appreciate positive drivers who take care of the road users around them.

I try to match car speeds if I am able or go slower. I never try to purposely overtake a car. It is unfair that a cyclist should feel safe on the road or the pavement, in fear of a car or the pedestrian.

I've seen a chav mobile nudge an old guy on a cyclist. I had to go over to him to make sure he was fine. Driver behind me asked if he was okay as he saw. We gave the thumbs up, all was well.

I think it's acceptable for all ages of cyclists, pro or newbie, to use the pavements, if they feel justified. I don't think it's justified if they are fast/dangerous on the pavement themselves. They would be no better than the aggressive cars towards the cyclists. We must set an example that cycling is a good thing, and not something to show off. I think cycling benefits me in every way.

I think the situation in which Nike ended up with the deal was without enough competition. If an Adidas / Puma / Warrior / Under Armour can show interest it could push the price up. 

Although we're not as sweet a deal as the other big4 (kit sales-wise - L'pool,Arsenal,Chelski &amp; the rags). Nike have just lost United &amp; Arsenal in successive seasons, leaving a big gap in their sponsorship budget and a gap in top Prem teams. A similar club / deal to look at would be PSG who also get a much better deal than us and renegotiated in 2013 I think.

However, It important to remember though that sometimes these deals sound huge (coughUNITEDcough) but it's because the kit maker can also buy into making money off other (not shirt) merchandise and negotiate other benefits/ privileges which drive the price up (and can eat into our revenue). For example, Newcastle's PUMA deal is inflated because Mike Ashley offers better deals for selling &amp; promoting their other sportswear through SportsDirect.

Honestly feel bad for him as he could still have contributed quite a lot to another premier league side. Borini will never be good enough for a top 4 side, or a side pushing for top 4.

Sakho is very overrated on this sub. He is a good defender but also makes just as many mistakes as ""mistake prone"" Skrtel, whether it's a misplaced pass or diving in. We could have conceded a number of times this season due to his mistakes.

Even with only being 5 points off 4th atm, there is no chance we will get 4th unless we sign a top striker and GK in January (which won't happen). 

I think our best formation when everyone is fit is a 4-3-3. We only play 5 at the back currently because of the complete lack of athleticism in midfield with Lucas and Gerrard. Midfield 3 of Henderson Can and Coutinho. Front three of Sterling Lallana and Sturridge would give us a side with exceptionally high workrate and Can / Henderson both being able to protect the defense.

Well it's either having a duty or requirement to do something, or being accountable for the results of your actions. But seeing as people say these things to provoke reaction, it's obvious they accept that, expecting people to react within the law.

The responsibility of the insulter ends as soon as the target reacts, as the form of that reaction is a free choice. Do they send an angry letter or go and shoot them to death? That is not the insulters responsibility in any way. People in our society are expected to react within the law.

As an example.

It's some strange fundamentalist belief in justice inherent in the system. The poor deserve to be poor and the rich deserve to be rich.

I understand their ideas I think. The only way to pull people out of poverty is to take away the reliance on the state.

I knew what to expect and when she formerly asked if I was in a gay relationship with my housemate I just responded with a 'no' as formerly as she had asked. I knew why she was there and I knew she had the power to stop my claim and subsequently leave me struggling for the basics. It just wasn't a laughing matter. Put yourself in my shoes for a moment and think what your response would have been. Sure I could have put on a little fake laughter but the thought of it never even crossed my mind, I was too busy worrying about whether my claim was going to be denied and where I'd be getting the funds to pay my share of the bills.. To clarify, my claim was put on hold until a decision was made. 

She mentioned that I was the second person she had visited that day, the first was a female couple in which she said they both started laughing and therefore she wrote them off as not being in a relationship. From that I knew she had already falsely labelled me as cheating the system as she wrote on her clipboard and I was far from being in a laughing mood. 

It was this woman's sole job of determining whether somebody is in a relationship or not and yet the reasoning she would chose is a lack of laughter at being accused of being gay.

Of course we are; we are way higher in the table and scoring a lot more goals, however I don't think that proves me wrong. Firstly this kind of information is meaningless without a comparison. For all we know we could be playing even better right now if we had a different manager - you know, one who could actually change his tactics during match, or one who actually gave Zarate a chance, or one who doesn't persist with Kevin Nolan; whom it is painfully obvious is a spent force at this level. Secondly, 

&gt; we're not that different from last year

seems very incorrect to me. Our new signing have been integral in our improvement this season. Jenkinson and Cresswell have been outstanding, in both defending and going forward. Song has drastically improved our midfield and Sakho has 9 goals this season and its only January. Cole, Carroll and Maiga only scored 10 goals combined over the course of last season. The squad has been massively improved, and that is why we are doing so much better this year. Allardyce is the same shit manager he was last season - have you noticed that when our new players are injured and we play with a team that actually isn't that different from last year, and play hoofball with Nolan and Carroll we play like utter shit.

Read:   
&gt;""The likes of Reina, Agger, Mascherano, Alonso and Torres did not cost a fortune and certainly weren’t world-class when they joined...""

Absolutely true. They were not world-class when they joined. The article highlights Reina, Agger, Mascherano, Alonso, Gerrard, and Torres as the spine -- and here's the thing -- they were the spine, and also, the only functioning part of the team. Johnson was brilliant in flashes, but recall: the entire left side of our team was... heh. Not exactly the greatest. And, when we lost one piece of our spine, the team fell apart.

Now, we're not relying on a single spine -- the team is more flexible than that, and honestly, I'm a lot more excited about our future of this team than the abilities of our 08/09 lineup. As far as the 3-4-3, we are operating a more decentralized support structure for the shape of our team. [Here's what I mean.](http://imgur.com/xhkzlBa)

Compare this to the [08/09 team](http://imgur.com/NcvEKAt), and recall what happened when Alonso was sold. You'll forgive me for lumping in Kuyt and Johnson under ""weak support,"" but it's true -- they could not carry the team from those positions. 

Even last season during the title-run, our formation in attack looked closer to a 3-5-2. We were playing a 4-1-2-1-2 in name, but [we'd actually been attacking with 3 at the back for quite some time.](http://imgur.com/dXx7bKF)

I think we'll continue to play with 3 at the back, and I think we'll see it pay huge dividends when we suddenly insert a lethal finisher (Sturridge) into the mixture. I think we'll realize what a wealth of young talent we have at our disposal once the system settles down and our players begin to mature.

In my view, the only way to change this situation is for more LGBT people to hold hands. The more exposure people get to this in public, the more normalized it will become.

If those 3 aren't playing we're basically the same with better fullbacks. 

The last month or so Kouyate has been injured, Sakho has been injured and Song has been rotated with Noble (who was injured a bit) during the winter season. 

And to add to that, Nolan played quite well after coming on. He had a few incisive passes and provided cover to the defense once Song was off. He was unlucky to not get us a winner too. And hell, it was him being the calm head that made sure Tomkins and Noble stayed on the pitch. Today was a good example of what he does bring to the team.

In the end, Nolan isn't good enough to be a starting CAM or CDM but he has a spot in the side and he has proved today that we're better of with him.

The difference between the fund and the platform is like the difference between a supermarket and a loaf of bread - you can go to multiple different supermarkets and they'll all have bread. Some of the bread is branded and you'll be able to get exactly the same bread from whichever supermarket you go to, some of the bread is own-brand and only available from one supermarket.

So you open an account with a platform, and they may charge you some fees for that. Then you tell the platform provider which fund you want to invest your money in. The fund is run by another separate company, may carry its own extra fees to pay a fund manager, and you'll be able to buy in to most of the same funds from all the different platforms. Or some platforms might have their own funds which only they offer (which may just be a particular combination of investments in *other* funds).

Whilst azelaic acid (Finacea gel) is an excellent acne and rosacea treatment, it might not be doing the best for you. You might consider asking your GP to prescribe 4% nicotinamide AKA niacinamide (Nicam gel). It's a bit less drying, moderates sebum production, boosts ceramide synthesis so strengthening the skin barrier. Not better as such, just a bit different.

Both azelaic acid and niacinamide are useful for PIH, but you also need to be applying and reapplying a broad spectrum sunscreen particularly as we come into spring. Zinc oxide is a broad spectrum sunscreen agent, but is also anti bacterial so might work double duty for you.

Also review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle.

/u/JohnMulroy, thanks in particular for breaking down the context. From everything, it seems you hit it dead on the money: reinforcing infrastructure and trimming wages should be a main focus. 

/u/Blubbey, you bring up a really interesting point about what we offer players. Knowing we can't pay as much or win as many, the players we do land all share, for one reason or another, a desire to play for the Spurs. Though I gotta say in response to point #4, when you see clubs like Real Madrid or Barca (**COUGHCOUGH**Chelsea**COUGHFUCKERSCOUGH**) lose to a mid-level team, it reminds you player reputations aren't the only (or arguably biggest, even) factor to winning: you have to play well together in order to win.

I mean I don't think that the point most people were trying to make with all the protests etc was that they agree 100% with the cartoon but that you shouldn't be murdered because of what you say and you should defy people who do that kind of stuff. What point is he trying to make with his silly 'thought experiment'. 

&gt;Here is a thought experiment: Suppose that while the demonstrators stood solemnly...the other night, holding up their pens and wearing their “je suis charlie” badges, a man stepped out in front brandishing a water pistol and wearing a badge that said “je suis cherif” (the first name of one of the two brothers who gunned down the Charlie Hebdo staff)...Some might have thrown their pens at him. One or two individuals — two brothers perhaps — might have raced towards him and (cheered on by the crowd) attacked him with their fists, smashing his head against the ground. All in the name of freedom of expression. He would have been lucky to get away with his life. 

I mean it's completely made up, would almost never happen and seems to serve no purpose apart from as like a sort of rhetorical plaster because something has happened to 'our side' that seems ideologically inconvenient. 

Maybe because (for activist writers) there is a constant focus on what 'we' or 'our side' is doing wrong to achieve a goal and when something terrible that happens shifting the focus onto 'their side' it provokes a different reaction, but obviously I don't really know.

Raheem Sterling is overrated. To me, he's this super pacy guy who can take on defenders one-on-one by punting the ball forward and beating them on pace, that's all. I thought he improved a lot last season, but looking at his current form, I realise he was just doing better because of Sturridge + Suarez's movement in the box. They drew defenders away from him, so he was able to run at a defender and create chances. If you noticed, most of his goals were also tap-ins where his pace and a precision pass from Coutinho/Suarez/Gerrard created a favorable situation. To me, he won't ever be an effective lone striker up front that Brendan has been making him play recently, but rather a workhorse pacy winger creating chances at best. World class? I sure hope so, but right now, not even close...

Coutinho is what's keeping our team afloat. Without his creativity and ""Brazilian flair"", the team plays way too cautiously, and all attacks that don't include him are built painfully and slowly from the back, and usually the result of a lucky break due to a mistake from the opposing team. Henderson, Gerrard and Lucas all are either lacking confidence or been drilled to value possession above everything else.. they seem to backpass so often that we're stuck passing the ball between Skrtl-Sakho-Lucas-Sakho-Skrtl-Gerrard-Lucas-Skrtl-Henderson-Gerrard-Can-long ball-possession lost. Coutinho is the only midfielder that tries to turn, take on defenders and actually spark an attack. He should be starting every match in my opinion, and I rate him more integral to the team than Sterling.

I've never seen a defender more uncomfortable on the ball than Sakho. If given time, his passing is impressive, as compared to Skrtl who just punts the ball forward, but when pressed by opposition forwards, I get very nervous hoping he doesn't make a silly blunder. So far, nothing embarassing from him comes to mind, but I feel it's bound to happen sooner or later. He also slide tackles inside the box so often, it really is surprising to me that he hasn't given away a penalty recently. Can looks a lot more comfortable on the ball, and I hope Sakho can get some confidence in that regard, if not, I will never rate him to be a permanent CB option in the team. He's just starting now because all our defense options are so shit (I'm looking at you Dejan). 

I have near-zero faith in Mignolet. Like really, I actually prefer Brad Jones. I know that's blasphemous, but 2 seasons of flappy-bird antics by Mignolet in the box has really lowered my expectations of him.",null,0,null,1421207667,null,0,1421207879,0,cnocrcs,null,t3_2scbyc,null,t1_cnocrcs,null,t3_2scbyc,null,null,null,1424887706,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; House of Lords: Here, we're elected but have virtually no power. Can we at least repeal the bit of the Parliament Act that says the Commons can bypass our decisions? We've put a bill through for you to debate.
&gt; House of Commons: Well, none of us can think of a good enough reason to say no.

Okay, firstly as I've already explained, the House of Lords already have plenty of power, so there would be no case for newly elected senators to immediately turn around and complain that the position they had sought election for was not powerful enough.

Secondly, in the real world, the House of Commons does not so cheerfully give away powers. I don't know what world you are living in where they take the ""oh well what the heck let's give away our powers attitude"". Can you seriously imagine any government would decide to scrap the parliament act despite the obvious problems it would then cause itself to get anything passed? You don't think that MPs, who will be skeptical about giving away their own powers and causes themselves problems anyway, will not be able to foresee the problems that you foresee? The parliament act was hard won, it's not something MPs would ever just give away.

&gt; And from there the fundamental difference is broken, and rightly so, given the now elected nature of the Lords. Better to just scrap it than dilute political power and talent and create a constitutional headache for... for what? So people on /r/europe won't make fun of us for having an unelected house?

Not to please Europeans, but for the reasons I've already given.

&gt; edit: This is made more likely when the House of Lords is elected proportionally - they will see themselves as the more democratic house with less power.

Well then it's up to supporters of FPTP such as yourself to make the case that they are wrong. Also, whatever your views of using proportional representation for the House of Commons, there is a stronger case for using it for the House of Lords. This is because in a revising chamber, having as diverse as range of opinion as possible is desirable, and having one party being able to control the house with a minority of the vote would never be desirable for the HoL, as some argue it is for the HoC. This is why most countries use proportional representation to elect their upper house, even if they don't for their lower house (I know here I go again using real world examples as if we could possibly have anything to learn from other democracies).

&gt; So. If smaller parties want more representation, they should be more popular. FPTP is a whole other debate 

You're being disingenuous here, but we both know under FPTP being more popular doesn't translate into winning more seats, that's why I disagree with it. The smaller parties will be more popular in May, they probably won't win more seats though.

&gt; Just campaign harder next time reform is on the table, and send out leaflets for the Greens and UKIP next May.

Reform is already on the table now, two of the three major parties and most of the public support and elected House of Lords. So it seems you are the one who needs to campaign harder to get the reform blocked, and since the Tories are now the only major party who oppose this reform, send out leaflets for them next May.

&gt; State funding of parties would do an even better job

Well I do agree with state funding of political parties, sill it's not mutually exclusive to an elected House of Lords, and much less likely to happen in the near future.

&gt; Granted, this is a decent reason. But I think people believe the false dichotomy between the status quo and an elected Lords; that it is the only alternative.

In reality, it is the only alternative that is being offered or likely to be offered. But I'm not sure I even agree that people are just against the status quo, in the poll I posted only 5% supported an appointed House of Lords. That's any form of appointment, it would include your proposals too.

&gt; &gt; Finally, the Lords is already party political, most Lords are loyal to a party

&gt; My proposal would change that, yours wouldn't.

Oh I realise this, it was more a point that if you think the House of Lords already does good work, which I do, then you would already be supporting a party political house, so nothing would be lost by having it formally elected. Clearly you aren't convinced by the need for the House of Lords in the first place, so it's pointless following this line of discussion.

&gt; &gt; plus they have no particular reason to act in the best interests of the public

&gt; Does Ofcom?

Absolutely, ultimately Offcom is responsible to the government, whom we elect, and if it doesn't perform it's job properly it will be dissolved and replaced. It's not just an academic point either, reforming or replacing regulators can be an election issue, Ed Milliband is making the idea of giving Ofgem more powers one. 

The Lords on the other hand, either the current ones our your proposed technocratic house, are/would be completely unaccountable to the public. Once they get their seat they have no incentive to act in the public interest.

&gt; We could just get rid of the Lords - that's an option.

Well for reasons I admit I haven't fully gone into and don't have the energy to do so, I see the benefit in having a separate revising house and think it should be kept. You mustn't be that keen on your technocratic house idea yourself then, you would happily see the house scrapped altogether and give 100% of power to elected representatives. In fact what are we even arguing about, what do you actually want: a technocratic House of Lords or just no House of Lords at all?

&gt; So, twice as many people don't support a fully elected chamber as do?

Or to spin it another way, 14 times as many people don't support a fully appointed chamber as do. Granted, a poll with only two options, fully elected or fully appointed would probably have been a better example.",null,0,null,1421208079,null,0,1421228155,0,cnocz0o,null,t3_2s9kxb,null,t1_cnocz0o,null,t1_cno15wj,null,null,null,1424887607,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

These days its more to do with the traders union as well as the farmers union - who initially didn't want the bigger stores to put them out of business by operating on a Sunday. (Sunday market farms and small convenience stores basically.) 

When the law was liberalised back in the 1950's it meant a growth in the number of corner shops and farmers markets (who weren't restricted by the new trading laws.) They essentially monopolised the entire Sunday trading business for 40 years and therefore put the hammer down on anyone trying to repeal the law. (Think of all those tiny constiuencies where the farmers hold considerable political sway.)

However on the other hand you have to counter-balance this with big business. This is why the 1994 law only specifies a certain number of hours - as it kept both the farmers and corner-shop owners happy, but also the supermarkets. 

These days though its entirely anachronistic when you consider that most convenience stores are now owned by large supermarket chains and farmers markets are operating on a much more integrated scale - and wouldn't really be that affected due to changes in social habits in the UK.

null,false,BigPurpleAki,null,null,null,"Okay, first of all don't try an patronise me. I  don't just expect the club to go out and find a player of kompanys standard tomorrow for 1 million but, and this may be a surprise to you, there are players out there who will not cost the earth and will improve the defence it is just a matter of finding them, as Chelsea did with cahill and as city did with kompany.

Toure was never brought in to develop into a top class centre half he was brought in to provide experience to a massively inexperienced defence and to be used in a squad rotation system

Coates is finished at Liverpool and has been for some time it was quite apparent from the start he was not Liverpool calibre. I expect him to leave this year for ~2 million. A 4 million gamble on somebody with a reputation? Worth it in my opinion.

Illori has yet to have a chance to prove himself but is still young and is at a decent club in a decent league so no comment can be made about him as of yet. 

Lovren is a tough one. The club are not in the financial position to be able to write him off and I think must work with him to improve. The reason I still have hope is that what he is doing wrong is easily fixable on the training ground if he himself is willing to put the hours and work in. On the ball he is our most capable centre half but his awareness of his surroundings and decision making leaves a lot to be desired, but as I have said this a problem that can be fixed.

Sakho as I'm sure you already know is a player I rate highly and in my opinion will be our 1st choice centre half come the end of the season should he stay fit. I think he has the potential to be one of the leading centre backs in the prem in a few years. All the talk about him being awkward on the ball is rubbish he looks better and better each game. 

Kelly was a player I had high hopes for and he looked like he was on the way to developing into a decent player but ultimately injuries destroyed any sort of a chance he had of having a career with us. Had he managed to steer clear of injuries I feel he would definitely be challenging Johnson for the right back position if he hadn't already claimed it for himself

Wisdom is another player like Kelly who has looked a very decent prospect and is currently doing very well on loan. Give him a year or two of regular football at a decent premier league team and I think we've got a real prospect who would be in and around the 1st team.",null,0,null,1421211767,null,0,false,0,cnoeqps,null,t3_2s7yeb,null,t1_cnoeqps,null,t1_cnnoz35,null,null,null,1424886711,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null
