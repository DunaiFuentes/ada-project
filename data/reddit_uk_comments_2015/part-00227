The EU craves the legitimacy of the people.

The member state governments have overwhelming control of the EU thanks to the Council of Ministers and the European Council, and whilst politicians will always be politicians, the fact that the EU needs this to be popular amongst the public is why I think they won't sell us down the river. Of course, the final agreement will be public for more than a year after it's made which will be plenty of time for scrutiny, and the European Parliament shot down ACTA thanks to public pressure (something the EU negotiating team is very mindful of), so there's still hope even if it does turn out to be rotten. But that the EP shot down ACTA is merely another indicator that there's no reason to distrust the EU - because the negotiating team is already wary of what will be acceptable to the EP, to national parliaments, and to the people in general - and they will negotiate with what's politically possible to pass in mind.",null,1,null,1434388226,null,0,false,0,cs7cts3,null,t3_39wcwn,null,t1_cs7cts3,null,t1_cs7crji,null,null,null,1437552620,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

EU immigration will sort itself out as economies move to an equilibrium, and it won't lead to any sort of culture clash.  

Non EU immigration is so heavily controlled that it's almost a non issue now. In fact it's so heavily controlled that it's become damaging.

Successful asylum claims are such a small proportion of the total that they aren't really worth bothering about. 

Illegal immigration *is* a problem: illegals don't pay tax and NI, their kids sometimes don't go to school, and they are open to abuse and exploitation. The best way of dealing with this is draconian penalties for the employers, but that won't happen because it would mean penalising government donors and cronies.

Why?

It doesn't make sense. The students who receive a free education are effectively an investment by the state, it makes no sense to make things more difficult for them.

I still think it serves as a convenient excuse for someone who may or may not be keen on staying anyway.

If there was a real will to stay, a person would. It is not an impossible task, far from it.

&gt;Above stats resonate with my personal observation of the people around me as well: practically all masters students who are not from the EU leave at the end of their studies. PhDs sort of lingers a bit in that 4 months period, but ultimately they leave too when they find a job opening in other countries where it's easier to deal with the immigration process. Or they simply return home, like what I said originally.

May I ask why?

It can't solely be due to increased bureaucracy. I'm sure those figures wouldn't have been much different prior to the changes.

Is there just a prevailing attitude among most foreign students that their stay is just a visit, with eyes on a future elsewhere?

And may I ask how you get a free education as a foreign student?

What's the process?

E.g. the striker signing last summer - Sanchez would've cost 35m, and we were happy to pay that; Remy's release clause was 10.5m, and we paid that; Balotelli cost 16m. It's not as if there was a fixed budget we had to abide by.

We're still looking within the league because Rodgers would prefer to add players that have prior PL experience. With players new to the league and country, it's harder to predict how or when they'll adapt (Markovic this season is a good example, though he wasn't helped by the switch to 3-4-2-1). Given that the RB signing will be an immediate first XI player, it makes sense in this case to go for a player with minimal adaptation period.

&gt;Some Jewish and non-Jewish fans of [Tottenham Hotspur F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.) adopted ""Yid"" (or ""Yiddo"") as a [nickname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname) and ""Yiddo, Yiddo!"" as a [battle cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_cry) and often identify themselves as ""Yid Army"". While such usage remains controversial, for the overwhelming majority of Tottenham supporters, it is used with pride.  Some Jewish Tottenham supporters use it with a political consciousness of the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Others use it simply because many of the fans and owners of the club are Jews. However, the name was first given to the supporters as an insult, due to the large Jewish following at the club. This following started in the 1890s and 1900s when the club was the team of choice for ""East-enders"" - including large numbers of Jewish immigrants - who could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10. East-end Jews have mostly moved to the north and east London suburbs and Herts and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues to run in families (a famous example is [Alan Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sugar)). For visiting teams' supporters the Jewish connection continues to be bolstered by the large numbers of - easily identifiable - Hassidic Orthodox Jews living in South Tottenham and Stamford Hill; but in practice there is no evidence of Hassidic Jews attending football matches. Nevertheless, you do not have to be Hassidic to be Jewish, and Spurs still has a strong Jewish fanbase.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-30/how-little-it-cost-bribe-senates-fast-tracking-obamas-tpp-bill

Corporate issues like:-

Banking regulations

Environmental protections

Fracking (whether it is allowed or not and whether there are any environmental protections or compensation is paid for pollution or e.g. earthquake damage done)

Monsanto (whether their GMO seeds are allowed or not and whether consumers should be allowed to know whats in their food - GMO food labeling)

The price of drugs and medicines (patent protections will be increased, delaying the introduction of generic substitutes. This will enhance the profits of drugs companies while killing millions in the third world by making medicine unaffordable. It will also kill a fair few in the US)

Maintaining or increasing the profits of major Hollywood studios

Will allow increased Corporate control over the internet and how internet content will be able to be distributed. Increased censorship and reduced access to accurate information (Corporate propaganda will be more prominent).

Side issues:

TPP will cost thousands more well paid American jobs and depress US wages, creating more poverty in the US. Poverty also kills.

Working conditions will be degraded in every country that is part of the deal. There will be less employment regulation, fewer employee protections and less Health and Safety.

Wealth will be further migrated towards the top 0.01% and away from the middle class and the poor in every country. This will make the top 0.01% even more powerful than they already are.

There will be a reduction in the average standard of living of every country that is part of the deal.

The only winners out of the TPP deal are multinational Corporations, their CEOs and their major owners. Everyone else will lose out, including the economies of all of the countries that are included in the deal. (The politicians in each country will be bribed into passing the deal.)

As every country included in the deal will lose out, the other major winners will be those countries NOT included.

This means that apart from Corporate Oligarchs, China is the principle winner. ",null,1,null,1434390582,null,0,false,0,cs7edpw,null,t3_39wcwn,null,t1_cs7edpw,null,t3_39wcwn,null,null,null,1437024061,null,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

Modern leftist economic theories in practice don't last long and have resulted in mass starvation and death because the theories where not possible in practise.

We don't just produce players to play for other teams. Udinese are a selling club. Some might say Southampton are a selling club, although I wouldn't agree. Liverpool is still a team that at the start of every season aims to win as much as it can. It doesn't just set itself up to promote its players to the highest bidder. Being a drama queen and making out that because Sterling has got his huff on reduces the overall status of the club is nonsense.

Cool, and I'm happy to be set straight on the issue. I'm not a linguist by any stretch and I had to look up most of the words you used. e.g. ""dental stop"" to understand what you were talking about.  

I even read about [T-glottalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-glottalization), and it's interesting to see the incursion of T-glot in to RP. 

I love the different accents in Britain, I enjoy hearing the slight differences, and trying to place where the person comes from.  Australian has nowhere near the same range of accents.

I am aware that Britain has class and accent prejudice issues, and I actually do consider myself lucky that I haven't met any obvious prejudice against my Australian accent - except for cricket and rugby ;)

That isn't to say they didn't do anything wrong, of course they did, but if you're disappointed they didn't truly live up to the Labour ideals then I think you should consider that by compromising on some of it they managed to achieve a lot.

The corrupt minister flees under an assumed name to a country that won't extradite him (having lots of money helps), the corrupt investor gets filthy rich, while the taxpayers of the poor country are left with a huge debt.

Also, the BBC have neglected to mention some key factual errors and misleading statements in the Sunday Times article that were pointed out by Greenwald, one of which was then quietly removed (with no retraction notice).

What the BBC has done here is cherry-pick statements made by Greenwald in such a way as to do the absolute minimum to satisfy their requirement to provide ""balanced"" coverage of the debate, and have done so in such a way that lends maximum credibility to The Sunday Times.

&gt; *A UK government source told the BBC Russia and China had information that had led to agents being moved but added there was no evidence any had been harmed.*

Are we to take this to mean that the BBC, as well as The Sunday Times, are now also being spoon-fed statements on Snowden by Downing Street? In their article yesterday the BBC referred only to information contained in the Sunday Times article, but they seem to have since been able to directly obtain comments from Downing Street officials after these same officials declined to answer questions put to them by The Guardian.

&gt; *A spokesman for The Sunday Times said: ""This story was responsible journalism and another example of The Sunday Times setting the news agenda.*

&gt; *""We reported what various reliable and well-informed sources from within the government told us.*

&gt; *""We fully stand by our story, as did the BBC which also had it confirmed by government sources in its reporting yesterday.""*

It really hasn't. And the level of sincerity in your wording just shows a complete lacking in understanding of modern day economics. You will not find a consensus that 'austerity has been shown to hurt the economy' among economists. You will find some economists that agree with the assertion; but it is not a consensus, far from it. And even it was a consensus that doesn't make it economic fact because mainstream economics changes every 10-15 years.

&gt;Cutting welfare so it's harder for people who want to work to work isn't going to help get people jobs.

When you word like that then of course it wouldn't work. You're not looking at the argument for what happens later. 

&gt;The conservatives are not literate economically.

Define 'literate economically'...

A neo-keynesian will tell you that neo-keynesians are literate economically.

A socialist will tell you that socialists are literate economically.

A conservative will tell you that conservatives are literate economically.

An Austrian School Libertarian will tell you that Austrian School Libertarians are literate economically.

........see the point I'm making?

&gt;There was a thread recently with a list of over 80 economic academics pointing out how George Osborne's recent speech ignored the most basic of economics.

They ignored the most 'basic' MAINSTREAM economics...

They were the ones who called it 'basic' and of course they will use 'basic' to imply that there was a fundamental flaw in the economic arguments of the conservatives. The consumption function for a time was considered to be a 'basic' economic law; until it was later reinterpreted.

It still astounds me that almost 99% of people on /r/uk have economics degrees.

Everyone keeps talking about facts; it's really funny. If you could hand me a stone that literally symbolised a fact and that fact was that 'cutting welfare is damaging in the long run' then you single handedly have solved one of the most fundamental issues in economics; congratu-fucking-lations.

Lets look at the facts that the article lists.

Well; it doesn't provide the magical stone.

What it provides is an analysis/breakdown of the who is going to receive 'x' less because the government stopped handing out 'y' amount.

null,false,leredditaccounts,null,null,null,"Hi OP, allow me to clear up your confliction. Like many young people in the country, you've been fed this view all of your young life, that you must enjoy diversity and multiculturalism for a truly productive and happy society. And that these are just people who are trying to make a better life for themselves by illegally coming to my nation.

I'll make an analogy: How would you like it, if me and 10 of my friends came into your house, raided your fridge, your medicine cabinet, took your children's textbooks, took over your tv as we wish, and messed the place up something awful? We're just trying to make a better life for ourselves, surely you don't mind?

This is what happens: north africans are either paid by terrorists, or decide to risk their lives, to cross the sea, and instead of stopping at the first safe country (which they must do, by International Law) they come to france. Then they try to stow away on lorry driver's trucks, ruining the goods and produce inside them, which causes the lorry drivers material economic damage to their businesses, their livelihoods, and by extension, their own families.

These illegal economic migrants believe Britain will house them, feed them, and give them great healthcare and education, all at the expense of the british people.

Now, let us think for a moment the job of the British government: to govern britain. To ensure British citizens have roads, military, healthcare, education, and welfare.

Now consider that our population is going up hugely, and that our doctors surgeries are packed, our schools are packed, council housing is being given to immigrants instead of british people.

Not only this, but the British people, having been drinking the pro-immigration kool-aid their entire lives, believes that if we don't let this happen, then we're just awful, evil, people who hate others and don't want to let them live.

Now to return my earlier analogy, if me and my 10 friends are knocking at your door, do you let us in? If you say no, good for you. Because Britain can't say no, because they're just sneaking in and finding all kinds of ways to illegally enter the country.

Some British people are so misguided, they're even campaigning for the closure of immigrant detection camps (because they'd rather the immigrants were allowed straight on to british soil to live).

Oh, and btw, you made a mistake voting for the greens. They want to get rid of our nukes, get rid of our military, and have literal open door immigration (because they want to get rid of the concept of nation states and just have ""earth"") they are also sexist because they believe women are children who aren't responsible for their own actions (they want to get rid of prison for women).

But it's ok, because I too at the young age of 18 voted for a party I shouldn't have done, and I am now much wiser. We're all constantly learning. By the way, history also shows that multiculturalism and multi-religion has never worked, and has always ended in violence. Look at the buddhists vs muslims in burma, the intercommunal violence in India, the protestants vs catholics in Ireland, the serbs/croats and their genocide event with Bosnia, etc.

&gt;__Langton's ant__ is a two-dimensional [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) with a very simple set of rules but complex [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) behavior. It was invented by [Chris Langton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Langton) in 1986 and runs on a [square lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling) of black and white cells.  The [universality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computationally_universal) of Langton's ant was proven in 2000.  The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as [turmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite) which add more colors and more states.

I think it was good for Snowden to blow the whistle.

Others, such as [William Binney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxnp2Sz59p8) had been trying for a long time to do the same thing, but they didn't have the hard proof Snowden did and so didn't get the same coverage.

I also respect that he used good encryption to keep that data safe.

But, that data did contain identifiable information of both British and American agents based abroad.

When Glenn Greenwald's partner, David Miranda, was withheld at Heathrow after visiting Laura Poitras in Germany, he had over 20,000 of these documents in his possession, and the password to access them [written on a piece of paper on his person](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10276460/David-Miranda-was-carrying-password-for-secret-files-on-piece-of-paper.html).

That is a major operational security fuck up! There's no two ways about it, it just is.

So, I do worry about the people Snowden gave these files to.

It's fair to suspect that Chinese and Russian intelligence agencies would want access to these files, and would target anybody they suspected had access to them.

I don't find it that unreasonable that they found a weak link somewhere and exploited it.

The popular opinion was that he would be moving to Europe this summer, but DC just signed him to a big money deal in hopes to elevate his transfer fee even more/possibly hold on to him for another season.

Let me put it this way: RIGHT NOW Bill Hamid is as good, if not better, than Brad Guzan (the US/Villa #1), and Hamid is still a baby in GK terms at 24. The only reason he isn't the US #1 is seniority. Guzan never got a fair shot while Howard was the man, so he's getting one now. By the time the next WC rolls around Hamid will be the guy between the sticks.

If you watched any MLS/DC United, you'd immediately recognize his talent level. He is a cut above any US keeper I can remember, including Friedel and Keller.

EDIT: For the record, I'm no lover of DC United. They are a fierce rival of LA Galaxy (my local club) and I have no love for them.

He says ""Yes if the people vote to remain British then they should be able to be British Nationals, but we should also look at some kind of joint administration in the future, as has been shown to work in the past in similar situations"".

I'd have been interested to hear exactly what he meant by that before making a judgement on the guy. Sadly because it was clearly a complicated topic the host moves away from that discussion and instead asks ""would you like to speculate about war as I want to keep viewers engaged"". God I hate TV journo's.

I don't know what 'joint administration' is, or if it works or if it doesn't, but I don't think Corbyn's position is ""lets hand over the Falklands"", that's like saying ""This doctors position is that he wants to cure my illness by pumping me full of chemicals"".

Your using emotive language to describe the action to try to discredit the idea, and being overly vague about the actual important bit of the statement.

If he's saying C16H18N2O4S then I'm down with that, if he's saying C8H7NO2S then it makes a huge difference.

- It has two excellent universities producing highly skilled graduates and both engaged in industrial R&amp;D
- It has a good schools system even if too much of it is run by religious nuts, and the plastic tokens given at the end (GCSES and A levels) get more worthless with every year... mainland GB and other countries have the same problems on that score
- It has reasonable infrastructure and international connections even if both of these could be better
- It has sectoral niches in areas like financial technology, light engineering, agrifood and some pharma (i.e. it makes things the world wants to buy)
- It is part of a G7 country with fantastic links to the emerging markets of the former commonwealth
- It has a good chance of soon being part of a country outside the regulatory stifling environment of the EU, able to make its own trade deals with the world's emerging markets unencumbered by the frilly concerns of France and the mediterranean countries

No region on earth is doomed to be economically dependent. As the Italian city states showed in the 15th century, Spain showed in the 16th century, Netherlands in the 17th century, UK in the 18th century, USA and Germany showed in the 19th century, Japan in the early 20th, Ireland, Chile, South Korea, Finland, Czech Republic and China in the late 20th, and Estonia, Indonesia, Phillipines and Mexico are showing in the present century, embracing global capitalism, leveraging human and financial capital in economically sensible fashions, sufficiently rewarding entrepreneurship and capital risk taking, can make almost any place on earth wealthy and surplus creating.

All of these places described above were once dirt poor, people literally living in mud, with large sections of the population living subsistence lifestyles. They all turned themselves around.

Biggest threats are the sugary fantasies offered by socialism and the belief that handing all profits and control to big government and their highly fallible political masters will somehow create an economic nirvana. Various regimes around the planet helpfully tested that idea to literal destruction for us 1917-1994. It rarely if ever is the case. Market economics is what really delivers wealth (do the compare and contrast from the 50 year laboratory experiment of West and East Germany for example). Embrace the market. Its one of the (many) reasons I counter Sinn Fein so much - their debunked economic worldview is a threat to everyone's economic well being in Northern Ireland - protestant, catholic, atheist, muslim, mormon and moron (some of those group descriptions aren't mutually exclusive of course).

To say Northern Ireland CANNOT be economically successful is to suggest that we must all suffer some collective genetic mental and/or physical set of human deformities rendering us uniquely incapable in the history of mankind of being an economically productive society*. If I was like some other eager commentors on this subreddit I'd even suggest the view was therefore 'raceist' and bask in my obvious moral superiority from having found reason to accuse someone of it. But call me prim and proper, I'd prefer to hold that phrase back for serious situations lest it be rendered meaningless from silly overuse if that isn't already the case.

And if anyone wants to bring up the mealy mouthed ""but we're too small"" line, see Switzerland, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, San Marino, Andorra, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kowloon for reference.

Mind you.., if we REALLY have to have mandatory stormont coalition forever to 'protect the peace process' (as obviously Sinn Fein would have to start killing people again if they weren't allowed to be in government forever) we may never be allowed by those wise men and women in Sinn Fein (without any economic qualifications) to adopt market economic policies properly.

I did your bidding and wrote a little reply just for you. May I now return to my business?

What the study shows is that these top firms favour people who come across as professional, and this tends to involve soft social skills which are attributed but in no way shape or form limited to middle class people.

I can guarantee you that the NHS has just about the most incompetent, frustrating administrative set up that I have ever had to deal with. I've had to deal with councils, multinational firms, builders, private individuals, the lot. But nothing is as frustrating and hair loss inducing as trying to get anything sorted out with the NHS. There is so much red tape about the most innocuous of things and a culture of question-dodging (I've had someone say that they're not the right ""Jenny"" in that department, and referred us to another Jenny that had their maiden name after a long pause who was conveniently not in).

This isn't a ramble about the NHS being a nightmare for external people to deal with, but it gives you some idea of why situations like this eventually come about. I have zero doubt that internally they have exactly the same issues getting a budget for someone (a friend works in the pathology department, and they've been forced to get a locum one in as they're so understaffed but aren't allowed a full time employee).

But make no mistake, in any well run organisation any silly expense like the above would result in nothing short of a verbal smackdown.

So, you don't know the first thing about it, but you'll make an assertion about it anyway without even making the slightest effort to check?  What is this, the Internet?

IV's are critical to most block cipher modes other than [ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29), which isn't considered secure.

&gt; it's unlikely that Snowden was using debian with a really old version of OpenSSL

The point is these things can be easily broken in ways that are difficult to detect.  If it can happen to Debian (wildly popular, open development model, slow release cycles, many eyes) it can happen to anything.

FreeBSD had one recently too, the -CURRENT kernel random number generator was broken for 4 months, without anyone noticing.

In both these cases they were in retrospect fucking obvious.  Debian was using a custom patch to OpenSSL that removed a weird line of code in the random number generator seeding function, which should have set off major alarm bells to anyone paying attention.  FreeBSD was just failing to call the function that turned the new random number generator on - a ""noobie"" error, from a fucking *kernel developer*.

How much do you want to bet that the CSPRNG on your Windows box is fine?  You can't check unless you can read machine code, and what if the mistake (or ""mistake"", in which case, it could be hidden *very* well) is something entirely non-obvious, like a `|` when it should have been a `^`?  One subtle error could take you from something impossible to crack even if you converted the entire mass of the universe into computers into something a state actor can crack in an afternoon.

I played around with the points calculator for the Tier 1 visa a couple years ago and it was completely different. It used to have things like qualifications/degree, foreign income, age, dependants, etc.  e.g. if you were over 40yrs old, you would *lose* points, a PhD was worth more than a Master than a Bachelors. 

Tier 2 (working visa) is just a working visa, and most of the points come from the sponsorship.

I think UKIP had the idea of resurrecting the original complex points system.

Completely agree with your point above. If it were up to me, I'd staple a settlement visa with every PhD certificate issued in this country. Probably for the masters students too,  particularly for those who graduate from the Russell groups unis. Unfortunately that's not the case, despite how much I wish it'd be different. As for the why, I'd hazard a guess and attribute that to the government trying hard to cut that net migration numbers to the 'tens of thousands' target. It's just a blanket rule that applies to everybody, starting from removal of the post study visa in 2012, followed by various measures each year to make it difficult for international students to remain in the country when they finish their studies.

&gt; And may I ask how you get a free education as a foreign student?

It was a call for a competitive scholarship open to anybody in the world, regardless of nationality. Such thing used to be somewhat common at the PhD level - although it seems to be less frequent nowadays. Anyway, I did well academically and was lucky to be selected.

My grandfather came to this country young to study at an aeronautical school of engineering, he spent his days earning 100 pounds when the average wage was 5 pounds. He was determined, did very well in his young life, and came here through legal means because he was a skilled worker.

Everyday I see researchers who are east european, who are chinese, who *chose* to came here, because the UK has great exchange programmes with many, many foreign universities so we can share knowledge and add value to their research culture, and they do the same to us.

(Disclaimer: I by no means consider myself to be very knowledgeable about economics, but I gave an honest answer based on what I know about Northern Ireland and its politics.)

I was happy to see that you started off addressing points specific to Northern Ireland, but was disappointed to see that you quickly derailed and (i) made a bunch of general statements that ignore factors which are crucial in the case of Northern Ireland, and (ii) went back to your usual tactic of penning a polemic against Sinn Féin for whatever reason you find closest to hand.

Northern Ireland came into existence before the Republic of Ireland. If the republic is held up by you as a comparative case in which economic stability can be achieved, then why hasn't Northern Ireland achieved this level of prosperity already? The answer: politics - something you have ignored in your analysis, but which is central. While the violence in Northern Ireland has abated (despite the fact that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that Sinn Féin keep their finger on the trigger under the table), the political situation is still toxic and looks unlikely to improve any time soon. The Stormont House Agreement is the latest demonstration of how the Northern Ireland Assembly is unfit to govern the region - the big boys in London and Dublin had to sit them down for a talk to make any meaningful progress on policy.

You seem to have just picked a handful of examples of countries that have enjoyed relative amounts of economic prosperity and stability, and have made an extremely broad comparison which ignores the specific reasons that have made Northern Ireland an economic black hole and that continue to ensure that it is economically stagnant.

Given that Northern Ireland has to compete directly with the republic for investment in Ireland, and the republic has been ahead on this front for a very long time now, how do you see this situation changing? Also, given the uncertainty of the position of the UK within the EU, as well as the fact that Northern Ireland has no meaningful political weight with which to influence the British Government on this issue, it is almost certain that the republic will continue to attract the vast majority of investment into Ireland. Or do you feel differently about this?

For someone who is so passionate about unionism, and harbours such disdain for republicanism, I wish you could actually back up your claims with detailed and specific arguments instead of making a few generic comparisons and then launching into one of the polemics you reproduce here on a daily basis. We know you hate Sinn Féin. You're entitled to your opinion in that regard. I'm not even going to challenge you about that because I'm not a big fan of them myself.

However, my major problem with modern unionism, which you seem to exemplify to a tee, is that it appears to lack substance or intelligent voices that present a clear and credible plan for the future of Northern Ireland. All it appears to stand for is upholding the status quo based on historical loyalties and a dislike of Irish nationalism. Aside from the fact that I disagree with a lot of the things you write here, you don't seem like an unintelligent guy, which is why I specifically asked for your opinion here. Although, the fact that you found the topic of the thread ""slight ridiculous"" speaks volumes. What's ridiculous about Northern Ireland developing a properly functioning economy instead of living off of Westminster subsidies?

I must say, I'm pretty disappointed with your response. When young, educated unionists can't even make straightforward economic arguments without descending into ""us vs. them"" diatribe, then I genuinely think that the days of Irish unionism as an influential political movement are numbered. Does it honestly represent anything other than historical supremacy based on religious, cultural, economic and political suppression of Irish Catholics? Does it do anything in practice except to provide the Free Presbyterian Church and Orange Order with disproportionate political influence? If there is substance to Irish unionism, I genuinely fail to see what it is.

If it weren't for Westminster's money, I think that Irish unionism would already be a minority political position in an Ireland that was on its way to being reunified. The main arguments for Northern Ireland staying in the UK seem to be based around Westminster subsidised services like the NHS, and employment from the bloated public sector. What if Westminster got fed up of buying the peace and decided to let Northern Ireland fend for itself? How many unionists are pragmatic and would shift opinion on the constitutional question, and how many are unionist ""on principle""? Should unionism have something to offer these people other than effectively meaningless representation at Westminster?

Surely you can provide a better answer than what you've written above. For someone who also claims tot dislike the DUP, based on the way you conduct political discussions by mainly blaming themuns (and other such unrelated raging) instead of addressing the point under discussion, I wouldn't count out a political career in their ranks if I were you.

Have fun ;)

Edit: About the dates that you said you were struggling on, I can give an overview of the chronology. In the early 1930s, due to the Wall street Crash, there were giant numbers of unemployed and living standards declined. Things started to recover when WW2 came about. WW2 starts with the surrender of France in May 1940, and the evacuation at Dunkirk as a result of Blitzkrieg. After Hitler fails to eliminate British forces, he decides to get air supremacy to prepare for a naval attack. This is known as the Battle of Britain in Aug-Sep which was a failure for the Germans. After this failure, Hitler resorts to the Blitz to damage civilian morale in Late 1940-Early 1941. There is then an idle period where Germans are focused on the Eastern front, with the Siege of Leningrad and Stalingrad (1943). Ongoing is the Battle of the Atlantic where British food supplies are threatened through U boats sinking cargo ships. 1944 June is D-Day where German defeat is confirmed in the following months. After Battle of the Bulge Dec 44, the Germans are done for and their surrender in 1945 follows. After the war, Labor wins the election, with the NHS established in 1948.",null,0,null,1434400899,null,0,1434401480,0,cs7l6lu,null,t3_39xyzh,null,t1_cs7l6lu,null,t1_cs7hhr1,null,null,null,1437029268,null,3,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,3,null

Any evidence of that?

&gt;  and the password to access them written on a piece of paper on his person.

No, read your own damn source. It says that there was a password to **one** encrypted file on a piece of paper, it does not allude to the relevance of this file and there is no suggestion that this was a sensitive file.

&gt; That is a major operational security fuck up! There's no two ways about it, it just is.

If there is a security fuck up then it happened long before Snowden was on the scene, because not only can a contractor walk away with a vast swathe of documents, but that vast swathe of documents are apparently sufficiently sensitive to contain identifying information about agents.

&gt; I don't find it that unreasonable that they found a weak link somewhere and exploited it.

I agree it's likely (though I think it would be quite ignorant to believe it to be a certainty), but what more could have been done to protect the information? If there had been no leak then there would be absolutely no chance of reform, and there would still be a gaping security hole in the security services themselves.

Leaking is unavoidably high risk, but it does not appear that there was any other means to instigate reform. If people are still complacent despite the scale of the leaks, do you really believe that the security services would listen to a contractor raising concerns about the ethics of their practices?",null,0,null,1434401678,null,0,1434403892,0,cs7lpn2,null,t3_39xthw,null,t1_cs7lpn2,null,t1_cs7hsrg,null,null,null,1437029707,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

&gt; ""openssl aes-256-cbc -in top-secret-snowden-files-ayyyy-lmao.txt -out come-at-me-china.lol""

It's funny that you'd mention this, because `openssl enc` is actually a great example of how never to encrypt stuff.  You'd think it would be great given it's the official OpenSSL command line utility, wouldn't you?  Nope.

[Here's the relevent code that derives an encryption key from your password](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/enc.c#L450):

                if (!EVP_BytesToKey(cipher, dgst, sptr,
                                    (unsigned char *)str,
                                    strlen(str), 1, key, iv)) {

Let's check the docs for [EVP_BytesToKey](https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html).

&gt; Newer applications should use a more modern algorithm such as PBKDF2

Oh.  We should be using something more modern like [PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC](https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC.html), which is already kind of old.  Oh well.

`1` is the **count** parameter, hmm:

&gt; Increasing the **count** parameter slows down the algorithm which makes it harder for an attacker to perform a brute force attack using a large number of candidate passwords.

So, not only is it a weak algorithm to begin with, it's not doing *any* [key stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching), it's basically just a plain HASH(password + salt).  And what's the default hash?

        if (dgst == NULL)
            dgst = EVP_md5();

MD5.  A single AMD HD7970 GPU [can perform](https://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/) 8.5 *billion* MD5 operations every second.  Imagine how many passwords/sec China could test.  You could almost not have chosen a worse way to protect a password-derived key.

There's also no sign of any authentication information - no HMAC, no AEAD ([explicitly blocked by it](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/enc.c#L300)), so the encrypted data can be tampered with and it will still decrypt ""successfully"".

Your data would actually be stored more securely using [RedditStorage](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/38kn2g/redditstorage_a_cloud_storage_that_uses_reddit_as/) ([please don't](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/38kn2g/redditstorage_a_cloud_storage_that_uses_reddit_as/crw1o03)).

If only.

There aren't enough jobs for people to fill, this is the first problem. Demand for the entry level skilled jobs is so high that we have a situation where skilled jobseekers are taking anything they can get just to fill the gap. This is described as underemployment.

The second problem is there is a 'skills gap'. A good number of employers are complaining about the lack of skilled applicants when they advertise a position. This is due in part to an ageing workforce closing on retirement age, a reluctance to train up new employees (apprentices and graduates) and last but not least the companies want the skills of a senior level employee but on an entry level paygrade. A lot of these positions simply go unfilled and this lack of resource hampers the productivity of these companies, which in turn slows the growth of our economy.

These two factors combined, and we have a situation where young people who have worked hard to acquire skills find that they can't get a decent position that they are qualified for. These people are currently manning call centres, supermarkets, fast food chains or are unlucky enough to still be in the dole queue. Those lucky enough to have escaped the dole queue may only be on 'flexible' part time or zero hour contracts, but not by choice.

I'm inclined to agree with you that some work is better than none... but we don't even have that.

In other words, a part of the population that actively wants Northern Ireland NOT to succeed. 

Yes, that is a problem.

They don't represent the majority though, and its a problem many other economically small countries have to deal with like the baltic states (the recalcitrant ethnic Russian population), Belgium (Flanders seeking independence) as well as revanchist parts of Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey. Doesn't stop any of those countries recording high economic growth rates though, and when people's economic lifestyles start improving nationalist fantasies about ""the historic motherland"" etc start to lose their potency. 

As mentioned, the biggest blockage to our future economic wellbeing is permitting Sinn Fein to hold a position of permanent blockage on adopting market policies. The countries listed wouldn't permit that, neither should we.

Nope. Its the latest demonstration of how weird and nonsensical the concept of mandatory coalition is. No successful country in the world governs with 90% consensus (for that's what the 5 Executive parties represent). Its an impossible yardstick. Get rid of it. Tomorrow.

Zero thanks to Sinn Fein. They've opposed the ROI's market economic policies every step of the way. Good thing most people down there see them for what they are. Beardy unqualified romantics for an economic world that only exists in socialist mythology. Let them wax lyrical in the back of a pub, but sure as hell don't put them in charge of your treasury policy.

&gt;how do you see this situation changing?

Get Sinn Fein away from Government. Allow us to tax less and spend less. They can cry ""austerity"" from the sidelines and see if they can get majority (or even above 30%) support for the apparent obviousness of their economic position.

&gt; it is almost certain that the republic will continue to attract the vast majority of investment into Ireland.

Is it? If we are freed from the EU's over-reaching regulations and are part of Europe's largest proponent of the anglo-saxon economic model no longer held back by Brussels? You don't think the likes of Google, Amazon, Dell, Johnson and Johnson could be tempted with a small move to where costs and overheads are cheaper?

&gt;Does it [unionism] honestly represent anything other than historical supremacy based on religious, cultural, economic and political suppression of Irish Catholics? 

And that's why I really couldn't be bothered with this particular thread. 

Yes, I'm a free market atheist libertarian.

So that *obviously* means I want catholics to be oppressed. By virtue of the enormous crime of also being a unionist. Natch.

Its boring arguing with nationalists on this. That's your starting point of what unionism is and you don't like to be moved off it.

Frankly its also insulting that that's what you think unionism represents (and suggests your schooling may have sheltered you too much from meeting and getting to know actual unionists in person).

The amusing part is that you're acusing *me* of ""us and them"" politics though while simultaneously making an argument that unionists only want to do down catholics. 

Cognitive dissonance much?

&gt;Does it do anything in practice except to provide the Free Presbyterian Church and Orange Order with disproportionate political influence?

Get rid of mandatory coalition and there's a reasonable chance we can get rid of the malign influence on government of both Irish republicanism AND protestant evangelicals (i.e. voluntary coalitions of the centre parties, UUP, SDLP, Alliance, Greens and various combinations thereof, as was hinted could be the case immediately post GFA. Trotskyite creation of crisis by SF since has obviously changed the electorate scenario since but it could still be reversed)

&gt;What if Westminster got fed up of buying the peace and decided to let Northern Ireland fend for itself?

It'd be a good thing. Necessity is the mother of invention. You forget, unlike Sinn Fein, I SUPPORT less subsidy. Dependency is NI's biggest curse. Cut benefits, cut the public sector and introduce the user pays principle to public services. It can be done, and as the ROI and UK are showing, can be (indeed is likely to be) GOOD for your economy. Fiscal autonomy tomorrow my friend. Its a good thing.

See - all of this tedious and circular as I predicted.

Unionists will argue NI can be economically self-sufficient and (with reasonable cause IMO) lay some blame at Irish republicanism for preventing it being so.

Nationalists will say ""no it can't"" using the self-fulfilling argument that a large section of population don't want it to be.

Bacon sandwiches aside, the entire leadership of that party is just total crap. Even most of the potential successors are yet more crap from the Blair/Brown eras. Dan Jarvis might have been half decent (and he is new blood) but he sensibly ruled himself out, probably for a few years time after yet another shitty leader does more of the same

&gt; we got another 5 years of brutal cuts to our public services and schools, 

If you think Labour wouldn't have had to do something similar, that's some world class denial. Wasn't Darling himself saying there'd be ""cuts worse than Thatcher""? http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8587877.stm

The choices are brutal cuts, or slightly smaller brutal cuts

&gt;  eventual privatization of our NHS 

What the Conservatives have done so far is nibbling around the edges compared to what Labour did - Labour embraced private involvement in the NHS, the use of dodgy PFI deals for new buildings, and, let's not forget, they started the sell off of an entire hospital to the private sector (the Conservatives finished it). They also had a lot of non-health sell offs and outsourcing deals

&gt; and tax breaks for the rich, 

They've made some greater strides on tax avoidance than Labour ever did.

&gt; along with 7 grand salary increase for MPs 

Would have happened anyway - and possibly isn't so clear cut as ""they get more money"", if it means a reduction in other allowances

&gt; and living costs rising for the rest of our peasants, with no living wage in sight.

The process goes that the admissions team for your course will sit down with everybodys results and make a decision. If you have made the conditions of BBB (which you may well have) then yay uni! If not then a decision will be made dependant on many factors, including how off you are. Obviously in this case, ABC is the best possible scenario!
However, your whole application will (probably) be considered! So if you can get in touch with the admissions tutor (this information is usually on the website, at least an email address) and ask the same question it will not go down badly and they may be able to give you some more detail on the university's process when this happens, which I am not able to answer.

If you don't get in and the course you've applied for is in clearing then definitely ring! In my experience they would accept ABC in this case (this is a different process to the one the admissions team use so it is still worth ringing!)

However, there will absolutely be risk assessment procedures around lone working as it is regular practice in your shops. Does it matter that you can't physically count the cash and shut the shop up in the time they give you when it's considered safe (i.e. when you're closed)? No. You either stay on past the time you get paid to do it all, or you breach the health and safety policies around lone working and go and empty the machines, go and tidy the shop, count money at the counter whilst you are on your own in the evening. I don't know a single manager that doesn't do it. No one wants to have to do unpaid work.
The point I'm trying to make, and it's what my manager told me when I started training, is that if asked you don't do it. But if you do go out there during times when you're supposed to stay behind the counter, the risk is yours, and whatever happens will be on your head as far as the company is concerned.
I personally, firmly believe that it does need to change. From anecdotal experience, robberies have increased in my area since lone working was introduced.

So your definition of who is a selling club is any team that hasn't won a competition, and sells any player thats mildly peeved with their situation to the degree that they get themselves a move. So as there's only 3 national tournaments a year, and since nearly every club sell 1 player per year who wants out for one reason or another, that means only 3/20 teams in the EPL aren't selling clubs. This would be 2/20 this year based on Chelsea winning 2 of them. So really the only difference with De Gea is your determination that ManU are more likely to win something than us, which is an opinion rather than a fact. They might have come fourth in the league, but we went further in the FA Cup. Which means if Villa had beaten Arsenal in the final, but then sold Benteke they wouldn't be a selling club, but because they didn't win that one match they now are a selling club if Benteke can negotiate his way out. Right... that all makes sense. 

But really the crux of your sad weary crywank is

&gt;Udine and Liverpool are similar in one aspect. They merely produce players and sell them who more often than not then go to win shit with their new teams.

So the list of players sold by Rodgers is 

http://www.lfchistory.net/Transfers/ByManager/25-0

So who are the players we've sold that have gone onto huge success??. Did Agger win the something with Brondby in the famous danish league?. Fair enough. Reina won the Bundesliga as reserve goalkeeper I guess with his one league appearance all year. Did Maxi Rodriguez and Kuyt win anything?. Maybe they did, I have no idea. But really, other than Suarez, nobody has won anything of any note. So in 3 years, thats 1 player.  Lets create a drama, this is huge. The club is obviously in crisis mode. Quick people, get marching so we can get these fools FSG out with their witchcraft such as long term planning.

In East Belfast the DUP got 5% less than the combined UUP-DUP vote in 2010, so I think it's a stretch to say the unionist vote went up.

He also doesn't examine how people on the fence (non-aligned, people who haven't voted before, soft nationalists, etc) felt about the pact and the impact on their voting decision.

Nor does he examine the long-term results, they kept 3 seats they might have lost this time round, but what about next time as demographics continue to change? Will this pact convince anyone in the middle to vote for a unionist party?

There's also the impact on their rivals, in East Belfast, Alliance got 5% more than last election, it's hard to mobilise the base to this extent in normal circumstances, he doesn't examine the effect this could have on future elections.",null,0,null,1434407229,null,0,false,0,cs7p6ma,null,t3_39wgt6,null,t1_cs7p6ma,null,t3_39wgt6,null,null,null,1437032398,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

Or does that paradigm not apply you just because you're educated?If so, it's not multiculturalism that causes discord, it's a lack of education. 

And if you can honestly say you and your family have been productive members of our country (and it sounds like you could) do you not think others deserve that chance? Not everyone who is successful ends up doing it through education, and so they can't all come here through university as others do. I don't say that to downplay what your grandfather did - my mother came here to study as well.

Much like you, I am the child of immigrant. And although I would agree that too much guilt in general (white, male, etc) is being felt in the country today, I don't think it's as a result of European immigration. If anything, I would argue that the person matters more than the nationality - a reasonable African well get on much better here than an Irishman who picks a fight with every Englishman he sees. 

Multiculturalism isn't a failure by any stretch of the imagination - lack of education is. Now I could see what you meant if you said it's not our job to educate people, they should get educated and THEN come here. But that isn't an option for a lot of people. Whether the situations in their own countries are down to the west or not is entirely subjective in my opinion.

Personally, I have found that I had no trouble at all integrating with british society, nor did my parents. I don't think that is because we're Indian and we assimilate better than any other culture - I think it's because they both spoke english fluently and had degrees before coming here. In that way, I understand the point you're trying to make, but you must equally understand the way your argument comes off on the first reading.

I didn't accuse you of any such thing, nor did I even insinuate it. I was talking about mainstream unionism, as largely represented by the DUP, and I acknowledged that you do not seem from your posts on here to be a follower of their politics. Also, I directly asked you to explain the substance of modern Irish unionism to me, and in order to structure the discussion I asked you specific questions which laid out the major negatives, as I see them, of Irish unionism as a political ideology. You have every right to respond to my impressions of unionism by explaining to me its virtues as a forward-looking and progressive political ideology. I would welcome that.

&gt; Its boring arguing with nationalists on this. That's your starting point of what unionism is and you don't like to be moved off it.

Can you blame me for holding the impression of unionism I do when your reply to my questions about the substance of unionism is to throw my perceptions back in my face without any attempt to clarify them? Not to mention that you did so in the middle of another ""us vs. them"" polemic.

If there is substance to your arguments then surely you can do better than comparing Irish nationalists living in Ireland to Russian separatists in the Baltics, or calling the elected political representatives of Irish republicans Trotskyites (which they aren't).

&gt; Unionists will argue NI can be economically self-sufficient and (with reasonable cause IMO) lay some blame at Irish republicanism for preventing it being so.

You haven't ""argued"" the point. You've simply stated it as though it is fact and you have now failed on two occasions now to provide any intelligible analysis of the Northern Irish economic situation to back up these statements. Even worse, you have failed to provide an unbiased (by which I mean realistic, given the different political ideologies that have to coexist with one another in Northern Ireland) view of how the economic situation in Northern Ireland could be progressed in any meaningful way. (By the way, the suggestion that Northern Ireland should dismantle its system of government and remove its two largest political parties is in no way a realistic suggestion - its farcical.)",null,0,null,1434407571,null,0,1434407951,0,cs7pdqs,null,t3_39ughw,null,t1_cs7pdqs,null,t1_cs7mwu1,null,null,null,1437032573,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

So, one.   ECDHE_RSA for key exchange, AES-128 in [Galois/Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) for authenticated encryption with said keys.  There's no multi-layer encryption here.

&gt; We're back to you claiming there's a break for AES_128 aren't we?

I never claimed that.  I've said repeatedly it's unlikely.  All the other stuff?  The random numbers, the rest of the software, the *people*?  Often broken, often in subtle ways nobody notices.

To quote Snowden:

&gt; ""Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that *NSA can frequently find ways around it*.""

null,false,leredditaccounts,null,null,null,"&gt; If you're the son of an immigrant and you feel multiculturalism will always lead to violence, do you think of yourself as part of the problem? 

I think being born here, having a southern accent, love of cider, sports, and english literature, has meant I'm treated just as if I'm a white guy. My family lived on council property and all our neighbours were white, and we all got along fine.

I'm not saying everyone has to come here through education to be a good immigrant, perhaps a work sponsorship that was advertised there, or someone that wants to join the military here (which funnily enough was why my granddad first came over, he wanted to get citizenship then join the RAF and become a super cool fighter pilot, but he couldn't because being colour blind meant he failed the medical)

I think multiculturalism goes against everything natural in a person - animals feel comfortable around those who look and act similar to them, it's just a function of our biology. Clearly intelligent humans know that race has really no impact on a person's likes or character traits, it's more culture I think, which is why humans can live in harmony together.

But I also think humans are self-interested, and becoming lax on this area has led to the high amounts of immigration, and the domination of religion throughout history (and I really do think religion is one of the single worst things that has ever happened to humans).

Sadly, atheists are still a minority, and the religions are still growing (aside christianity, which is predicted to be dead in britain by 2067).

i love this guy
ynwa captain

EDIT- 
I get it a lot of other fantastic players have similar stats and you may not think he's at that level but i truly believe he does, he always puts in great balls when he crosses, decision making and passing is very good, stamina, strength, and pressing are near unmatched in the league. and he's a good playmaker, even this year he hit double digit assists without a consistent striker to bang 'em in. 

also he has scored quite a few for us, especially considering he's a box to box player, and now i believe he'll be hitting his peak soon. most of his goals come from around the edge of the box. 

this man is our future we need to always support him ynwa

It got progressively worse if the bike was sat. I worked out a couple of ways to free them off.

Clutch in as much as it will go, front and rear brake on start it in gear. Hopefully the starter motors pressure will break the contact. On a 125 might need two people putting weight on it so as to not just spin the rear on the ground. Could consider blocking the rear but that's generally how spokes get broken.

Failing that, sit on the bike point it down the road and press starter, let the bike rolling start. When the engine starts get a decent amount of speed up and snap throttle closed and full clutch the force of the rear will should snap at least some of the plates apart. Once you have one of the plates free you can just do aggressive acceleration/deceleration to free the rest. I found five minutes of this sorted everything out.

A couple of points to this:- 

* both the above arent particularly mechanically sympathetic.
* at least the latter is quite difficult, and dangerous. If you're a new rider probably best to get someone else to do it
* mine was on a Ducati, they have massive cylinders so the backwards compression is quite high a smaller engine might not have the brute force to do it. The starter motor is more powerful than most too for the same reason.
* a Ducati has an exposed and dry clutch mine had got rain in and rusted together. I'd wonder why a wet clutch not exposed to the weather could get like this.
* I eventually changed the plates anyway, maybe save yourself the risk and just change plates. 
* Taking plates out leveraging them apart with a screwdriver and refitting sorted them out till next heavy rain. 
* could the existing plates just be mis-aligned. I had this too - seperately - when two pressure plate return springs broke on the same side. The plate came out at 45 degrees so the plates were still being pushed together on one side - felt similar with a feeling like I had maybe 10% clutch rather than 0%. That said if you have new plates ordered its probably worth just waiting and being vigilant when dismantling rather than taking apart twice - esp if you are going to have to deal with the oil both times.
* be very careful taking advice from a stranger on the internet who's never even seen your bike ",null,0,null,1434408344,null,0,1434408981,0,cs7pucx,null,t3_39ygmb,null,t1_cs7pucx,null,t3_39ygmb,null,null,null,1437033037,null,4,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

Wow, that's aspirational. 

He doesn't want to tackle the Tory press lies about  ""Labour overspending"" around the financial crisis (despite the fact Tories backed the spending) because the public believe it anyway.

And he doesn't want to attempt radical change that effects the majority in society (instead of the minority) because Milliband lost  advocating slightly centre-left policies, so he assumes there's no way an election can be won running a left-wing campaign... Even though Milliband didn't make radical proposals to tackle the major issues that resonate with the majority of people, like housing, austerity, wages, &amp; inequality.


Accepting the neoliberal 'businesses are more important people' (I mean wealth creators are more important than employees) and pro-austerity, pro-privatisation, pro-fixation on the deficit rhetoric at the expense of actual people, will not get Labour elected again. 

Scotland should've been a wakeup call for Labour to make drastic left-wing policies that the majority of people will benefit from, not go backwards to Blair's  Labour version of neoliberalism which is essentially ""I agree with the Tories on pretty much everything but I'm going to be a bit nicer"".

I don't see them as mainstream unionism. I see UUP as mainstream unionism. How do you define mainstream?

&gt;I directly asked you to explain the substance of modern Irish unionism to me

I don't see unionism as an ideology. 

An ideology is ""a system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.""

Being a unionist doesn't in any way predict your economic or domestic policy opinion.

Unionism isn't an ideology, and in fact doesn't really deserve the -ism (perhaps where the confusion is coming from). Its simply an expressed preference on constitutional status. It therefore houses within it a vast multitude of ideologies. Left wing and right wing, liberal and authoritarian, religiously dogmatic and secular. That much is clear in all unionist parties. I can only speak for my own ideology. Libertarianism. Unionism is my constitutional preference, not my ideology. And that particular ideology is a tiny tiny part of unionism, if it could even be described as a part. Probably about 3 of us all told. But heah, got to start somewhere...

But given I don't see unionism as an ideology I can't really answer the rest of your questions as I don't recognise the premise they're based on.

I accept some DUPers get on like unionism is an ideology though. You'll need to take your points up with them therefore.

* The possibility of paying money for membership and not getting any tickets at all

* Being online to try and buy tickets the moment they are on sale, preferably an hour or so beforehand.

As others have said, membership can't guarantee you tickets to a specific game, and to an extent it can't guarantee you tickets to *any* game. It's not really first dibs on tickets - without membership or a season ticket you basically can't buy tickets online at all. On top of that the big games usually have qualification criteria based on how many games you went to last season, to the extent where they're basically as good as sold out before they ever make it to general sale.

It's a risk, but since he is in the EPL and he is known to be one of the better English prospects it's natural for him to demand more in wages because of homegrown rule. This will become a liability if he doesn't live up to that price tag. Which so far, he kinda hasn't.


Bale:

No way in the world is he worth that much. You can make the argument that he is the biggest player (maybe bar Rooney) the UK has to offer. But is that what 100m should buy? NO! He never really showed that potential to be worth that and didn't DOMINATE like previous record breakers have in the past.


James:

Obviously a great transfer for Real and he is honestly worth 80 million. BUT if Real did their research BEFORE the WC and invested in him prior to his claim to true fame. They probably could have snagged him for ~40-60 million.

null,false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,null,"&gt;You think that an anti-austerity platform would be bad? 

We saw how utterly miserably people rewarded Miliband's position this time around. Beyond losing a few floating voters to the Greens (which didn't lose them enough to substantially affect the election's outcome), austerity wasn't the issue that swung the election away from Labour- the thing that crushed them, overwhelmingly, was perceived economic competence. 2007 still looms large in people's memories. 

Anti-austerity politics worked in Scotland, but the SNP's rise is substantially more complex than simply being marginally to the left of Labour on some populist issues. It'd be disingenuous to put that down to their stance on austerity.

The stranglehold the austerity discourse has had over the window of ""credible"" positions the public seem to want to vote for isn't something that can really be broken by Labour- certainly not after the sheer damage done by the past five years' ludicrous incompetence in defending their record. 

The time to take an anti-austerity platform was the 7th of May 2010. The damage to Labour's credibility has already been done in the public's view- finding a backbone and defending their record would have been necessary to counter the Labour-sold-us-up-the-river narrative *then* if a pro-growth stance were to be credible at any point from then onwards. As far as the public's concerned, the crisis was Labour's fault- and the past five years' pain's been a matter of struggling to pick up the pieces they left behind. 

That narrative's embedded so strongly into the national consciousness that it's not going to go away. A staunchly left-wing Labour leader would be a gift from the Gods to CCHQ's press operation- the ""*Chaos of a Labour Government*"" line wasn't chosen without reason. It *works*.

&gt;Anti-Trident?

Really, really not a deciding issue for people that care about getting rid of it, but a *huge* issue for people who care about keeping it. The Cold War really isn't so long ago, and the Russians have hardly been pleasant neighbours this past few years- an anti-Nuclear Deterrant Labour platform would be an open goal for CCHQ - ""playing politics with the nation's safety"", and so on.

&gt;He's suggested a vote, if I'm not mistaken, on the Falklands.

[We had that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013). The result was 99.98% of the population voting to remain, unequivocally, British. 

That this is even an issue for *anyone* after one of the most overwhelming democratic results in recent history speaks of a certain kind of moral cowardice on the part of anyone still calling for them to accept some kind of joint administration- they've voted to remain with us, in response to a referendum question that left no doubt whatsoever that it left no opening for such an arrangement. 

The only people in politics still willing to so much as give the Argentinians the time of day on the topic are people who never moved beyond 1983.

&gt;You really think that a brushed-aluminium candidate would be best for Labour?

Yes!

Given the choice between a mediocre result in 2020 and an eighties-style demolition, Labour ought to choose the best available. The country hasn't voted for a strongly left-wing Labour party for decades- with ample reason. 

&gt;Come now Locutus; given the scarcity of Lib Dem candidates who would you vote for in 5 years time

I'll vote for whoever had the greatest chance of extracting the Conservatives from office. If they pick Corbyn, that won't be Labour.

I think you're underestimating the scale of the mountain Labour has to climb next time- the boundary changes the government's going to push through will slice another 30+ seats off what Labour can reasonably expect, every one of them going to the Tories- the chances of Labour winning back any significant ground in Scotland are vanishingly small, and the Lib Dem vote has been squeezed as far as it's likely to ever go. Labour aren't likely to win the election unless they can capitalise on a major failure in this government's term- to exploit that, they *have* to field a candidate the public will perceive as charismatic, credible and *safe* after they've been filtered through the media.

Most of the other candidates meet at least two of those criteria. Corbyn meets absolutely none.",null,0,null,1434413194,null,0,1434413384,0,cs7slkk,null,t3_39wnc0,null,t1_cs7slkk,null,t1_cs7q8r3,null,null,null,1437035202,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

Agreed. The obvious example demonstrates that much.

But the issue, I worry, isn't so much the sticking-to-principles aspect, so much as the principles being out of key with the set of principles the public will actually vote for. 

I don't think Corbyn's got that, however nice it would be to see a resurgent Old Labour.

Agreed, completely.

I'm a huge fan of Harman. Were she standing, she'd *completely* outclass the rest- were it not for her woeful civil liberties record, I'd be tempted to join up to vote for her myself. She's consistently been a tireless supporter of progressive causes- even if I disagree with her on a fair few fronts. She's difficult to dislike, frankly- seeing her talk at my university was quite an experience.

Ah, I think you're doing the Greens a disservice there- they're significantly to the left of the tepid shower we're seeing from Labour this time around. The contenders are a singularly unimpressive bunch, but with the exception of Corbyn, it feels like they haven't moved an inch from 2010- the nebulous centre-centre-left of convenience.

&gt;Mr Clegg was a man who ditched those principles for power and you have witnessed first hand the results of such a move. 

I think this is a touch unfair on Clegg. As his principles go, I'd say he stuck by them- the issue was the party's platform in the first place. The 2010 manifesto was a populist mess- name a bandwagon, and the Libs had jumped on it- people seemed to conveniently forget the brouhaha over Cable's coming out with that announcement that the Lib Dems would advocate ""savage cuts"" before the election as soon as they got into a position to implement it. The only U-turn that ended up mattering from a policy standpoint was the tuition fees vote- the rest was all blowback from a public that felt betrayed by the spectacle of the Lib Dems' no longer being the party of Charles Kennedy. The Orange Bookers' positions were in the open long before the election.

If nothing else, I'm rather glad that the efforts to rebuild the party won't be dominated by the toxic Orange Book tendency- the party's seen what happens when it swings away from the thirty year long strategy that clawed its way back into a position of relevance for a bit of short term gain, and I think we'll learn from that.",null,0,null,1434415097,null,0,false,0,cs7tozw,null,t3_39wnc0,null,t1_cs7tozw,null,t1_cs7t6rl,null,null,null,1437036076,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

&gt;  The report states that in late April 1982, they intercepted a message sent from naval headquarters ordering the Belgrano and its escorts to a grid reference within the exclusion zone and not back to base as the Argentines later claimed.

&gt; The Belgrano was sunk by two torpedoes fired by the hunter-killer submarine Conqueror on May 2 with the loss of 323 lives a number of miles outside the exclusion zone.

&gt; “For some reason they decided on a rendezvous point still within the exclusion zone,” Major Thorp said. “Whether they were trying to raise a thumb at us I don’t know. At the time I thought it was strange thinking why didn’t they go straight into port?”

&gt; In his new book, The Silent Listener, Major Thorp wrote: “The findings of my final report stated the destination of the vessel was not to her home port as the Argentine Junta stated but the objective of the ship was to relocate to a prearranged RV within the exclusion zone.” ",null,0,null,1434415870,null,0,false,0,cs7u4xd,null,t3_39wnc0,null,t1_cs7u4xd,null,t1_cs7q1nw,null,null,null,1437036461,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

I went into it thinking the exact same thing - that evidence and a rational framework gives all the answers, but politics corrupts it. During my degree I had a chat with a former Chief Scientific Adviser at a government department. Nobody disagrees that policy should be evidence based, he said. The problem, as he explained it, is that a perfectly randomised double blind trial rarely exists when we need it. The evidence isn't always very good. Even when it is, it can only give us an idea of outcomes. Our priorities are something else entirely and are often informed by ideology. It's for this reason that although technocrats take over where they can, where priorities are uncontroversial (e.g. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee), for the most part our government is made up of ministers rather than committees of scientists, economists and engineers - partly because ministers respond to the public will, partly because when the evidence is poor they have to take really tough decisions that scientists can't help with. ""That's when they really earn their salary,"" he said. 

One very valid criticism is that ideology often adopts the modes and styles of evidence based thought to disguise itself. Policy makers often look for reasons to do things they have already decided on. Ministers say what they want to do and then ask for the evidence to back it up.

Licences are weird. (If you have an auto car licence, and pass a lorry test (C or C1) in a manual, everything is upgraded to manual, but a BE entitlement stays auto only (unless you do manual CE, maybe (but you could pass CE in auto...)))

Edit: For Posterity

A: Motorcycle
B: Car (gross vehicle weigh (max) up to 3500kg) and 750kg trailer (or car and trailer combination up to 3500kg)
BE: Car with trailer (towing vehicle up to 3500kg with trailer up to 3500kg)
B1: Restricted Car/Trike Only issued to those with disabilities (the little picture of a van is stupid) 1 seems to indicate subclasses
C1: 7.5t vehicle. Subclass of C
C1E: Vehicle+trailer combo up to 12000kg. Restrictions! Older licence holders and those under 21 can only have a combo up to 8250kg. Also the trailers GVW must not exceed the GVW of the vehicle. So a 7.5t tipper pulling a 3t digger is fine (and a valid usage). This rule doesn't apply to BE or CE
C: The fun stuff. My stuff. Anything up to 32t with a trailer weighing up to 750kg. No combos of say 18t tractor vehicle and 10t trailer.
CE: You are a god of the road. Drive whatever the fuck you want. (Up to 44t. Tractor vehicle can weigh more than the trailer.
D1: Minibus. Vehicle with over 9 seats weighing up to 3.5t (4.25t if disabled access equipment is fitted). Max seats is 16.
D1E: Minibus plus trailer. Weight is never explicitly mentioned but probably follows BE limits (as that's all a minibus is, a big van).
D: Coaches and buses. Anything over 16 seats. This includes 90 seat articulated buses. Which is stupid. Also these are limited to 62mph. C class vehicles (LGV's) are limited to 56mph... Argh!
DE: Coach and trailer over 750kg. Rare.
F: Tractor
G: Tracked Vehicles
K: Pedestrian Powered Vehicles (tarmac rollers, lawnmowers)

At the end, when the light had gone from the past lit Gabilan mountains, it suggests how after Lennie's death, George has no hope for himself, and becomes another migrant worker with no friendship.

* **Animals &amp; The Natural World**: this is man vs nature, a recurring theme in OMAM, showing how what humans are doing now go against nature and should be stopped. 
e.g. at the beginning, when the sycamore tree limbs were smooth from being sat on and the path was ""beaten by boys"". This deterioration and lack of respect for nature goes against the natural way of life, much like the migrant workers. The horses before Curley's wife death also go wild and make a lot of nice, suggesting the disturbance humans have on the natural world &amp; the animals at the beginning and end show the cruelty of nature, as well as man's disturbance of it.

* **Items**: represent what is important to a person, and references to the cold truth of 1930s America.
e.g. in Crooks' bedroom, we see a ""mauled copy"" of the Civil Right's Code and a dictionary, showing how he is desperate to try and educate himself and achieve the American Dream.

null,false,Fingerbob,null,null,null,"There's loads of devices out there which let you stream TV or movies. I've got a few of them, so I'll try and describe what's good and bad for each.

First off, see if your TV is a smart TV - if it has a network connection (wired or wireless) it might have apps, and if it has apps it'll likely have iPlayer / Netflix / Amazon instant / 4OD and some others. My Bravia has a great selection of apps, and I probably use it more than my other streaming boxes - but some TVs are pretty crappy in that department, and older TVs likely won't have any of that stuff.

If your TV doesn't support streaming, your next stop will likely be some kind of box or dongle. I've got the Amazon Fire stick, a Chromecast and an Apple TV. They all support the main streaming on-demand services (iPlayer, Netflix). If you want something specific (5OD, 4OD, ITV player, Hulu, Amazon Instant for example) then it's best to check the box supports it before you purchase. If you want to watch movies on something like iTunes, Google Play etc then the best place for that will be the equivalent device - but they pretty much all have services that let you pay for movies with similar selections.

If you have lots of Android devices, I'd probably plump for a Chromecast. If you have lots of Apple devices, the Apple TV ain't bad. If you don't, then I'd probably go for the Amazon Fire stick.

Chromecast can be used to stream media from a local media server (a NAS like a WD or Synology box, or Plex for example). I've not seen any easy way to do that with the Fire stick or Apple TV. Not sure if the Roku supports local media streaming.

Chromecast doesn't come with a remote - you need to use your phone/tablet/laptop to control it. This can be good or bad depending on how you want to use the device.

Apple TV is expensive for what it does, unless you want to stream from another Apple device (macbook, iPad) in which case it's useful.

I've tried a Roku 2, but don't own one. From reading the reviews of the recent Roku units, I'd say that the Amazon Fire stick is probably just as good as any of the Roku boxes (but I could be wrong!) If you've got Amazon Prime, you get the Amazon Instant Prime video for free, and the Fire stick works well for that. I use the Fire stick on the kids' TV and they find it easy to use.

Before I got my Bravia I used my PS3 for streaming both local and on-demand content. PS4 does on-demand pretty well, but doesn't do local streaming at all currently. I don't own the recent XBox but I'm confident it has on-demand streaming abilities to match. If you already own one of these consoles, give it a try before you splash out on another box. I wouldn't recommend buying a console just for streaming TV but if you have/want one anyway, they're probably just as good as the cheaper alternatives.

Happy to answer questions about the devices I do own, hope this is helpful.

We just barely scraped the beginning of the season without Suarez and we arguably lost the title because Hendo got suspended the last three matches. We didn't have Europe and we got knocked out of the cups early so we could only concentrate on Saturday. Have you forgotten how many people were quick to disregard our form because we had rest compared to other squads? Never mind that they were bigger squads.

""Personally i think we would have been better off with 1 player like Sanchez than say...""

Yeah, except one player you cited was injured (surprisingly based on his career) and one player was young (for the future). Balo was a shit buy through and through. And Rodgers didn't want him. That much is clear. But we only went for Balo BECAUSE...dun dun dun...we couldn't get Sanchez. And who are these imagined ""1 player(s) like Sanchez""? 

Where are they? I'll tell you where. There are hardly any of them. And the ones that do exist think exactly like Sanchez. Why go to fucking Liverpool (the city) when I could go to London and get paid more. 


We'd all love to be able to sign a Sanchez, but as you said in your own damn post, it's easier said than done. 

We needed to sign squad players though. That's a fact. You can't play in Europe, two cups, and the league without a massive squad. It's why lower league clubs have actually been upset to get into Europa league. Because their squads can't handle it and they end up in the relegation zone. 

Because FSG's policy is to buy young and sell for a profit, most of our squad buys were not established players. Can (who was forced into and forced himself to be a starter), Marko, Lovren (even, when you consider we had two starting CBs already), Lallana (even, when you consider his starting usually means a rotation of attacking players who also deserve to start) and Balo were all arguably squad signings because there was no guarantee they'd start. 

Honestly, without the depth of our squad this year we would have had no options for dealing with the absence of Sturridge. Rodgers having so much depth in different positions allowed him to tinker to find a lineup that had us as the form team of nearly 2/5 of the season. That's no small thing. 

So yeah. We can't just sign a star like in FIFA and expect it to sort itself out. You need a squad first. ",null,0,null,1434425502,null,0,false,0,cs7zxn4,null,t3_39yei2,null,t1_cs7zxn4,null,t1_cs7p08e,null,null,null,1437041186,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Assuming you're on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (the norm in England and Wales) then the default position is that you have the right to leave at the end of the fixed term without formal notice.  The Office of Fair Trading wrote a [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284440/oft356.pdf) some years ago where they took the view that any clause which seeks to impose a notice requirement was unfair and therefore unenforceable:

""3.78 A tenant is not required to give notice to bring the tenancy to an end at the
end of the fixed term. That is because a fixed term agreement comes to an
end at the end of the fixed term, and no periodic tenancy will arise if the
tenant then leaves. We appreciate that landlords will want to ensure that
their properties are not left empty between tenancies, but object to terms that
impose a contractual obligation on the tenant to give notice in order for the
tenancy to be terminated at the end of the fixed term. This could allow the

Thing is, if you're not going to make key2 the same way you made key1, now not only do you need to double-up on the cipher, you've got to double up on the key generation too.  So, a second, different cryptographically secure random number generator, which a second, different mechanism for seeding, and a different way of combining that with the password to produce a secure key.

Piling on complexity like that tends to be frowned upon.

Maybe, but there's certainly room for doubt.

The relative weakness of state schools is an obvious and significant issue too (and probably one that's easier to fix, although still very difficult).

But the narrow focus of ""the professions"" is a significant problem too.  The top-of-the-top employers won't even sully themselves at mere Russell Group universities, they hoover up strictly Oxbridge only (and maybe graduates of one-or-two particular subjects at other Top 5 institutes).  You can be the best in your year outside of those Top 5, but you'll have to do twice as much work to get in.

It's all a big self-perpetuating system that only benefits itself.  A handful of big law/consulting/finance firms, all serving the same handful of international businesses (and government) headquartered in London, which are nearly all staffed (at senior levels) but the alumni of the law/consulting/finance firms.  Of course it makes business sense to hire people who will fit-in to this world, but it's also incredibly bad for the economy generally, and the 99.9% of the population that don't fit-in to this world, that this small (in terms of people) part of the economy is such a big part when measured in turnover/profit.

Even when the companies in question aren't even British (which hardly any of the consulting/finance firms are), they still inject themselves into this system.  While people defend the hiring practices of these companies as ""hiring those who they think will do well"", it's also true to say that the career paths at the lower-end of these companies are specifically designed to be a continuation of the slippery-slope of a pecking-order that the candidates have been climbing since their public-school days.

The truth is, the system isn't that great either, it's a machine that chews through as many posh-graduates as it can, and only a percentage get through to the inner-clique that forms that circulates through the revolving door between government and private sector at director-level.  The rest will fall out and not be welcome back, but still quite often having earned/learned enough the way to be successful at something else.

Indeed many of the career paths outside of this world are better: in terms of interestingness, work/life balance, and even money (at lower levels).  One of the biggest problems is the rarity of opportunity outside of these London ""professions"", just as much as there is difficulty getting in to them.

Why could they not get a British person to do his job so we could have denied him entry? If there were no British people who could; why did we not train some up so we didn't have to allow him into the country?  

By your own logic, your own grandfather should have been denied entry because he's simply not British. He *wanted* to come here, but that's not good enough. He *had* skills, but that's also clearly by your own logic not good enough. Again, in your own words, ""be objective, not emotional"", to you he's someone important, to the government he's a statistic. As statistic that vile ""newspapers"" are using to whip people up into a frenzy over an *invasion* and making the government do idiotic things.   

Do you really not see how incredibly short sighted it is to not jump at the chance whenever a skilled migrant wants to live in this country? Or would you rather the government panders to people like you who put nationality before skill?  

All that will do is take away the advantage Britain has over every other nation in Europe which it gained through the English language and good universities. People will just go to Germany and France, despite the language differences. Some universities, particularly in Germany, are taking advantage of Britain's xenophobic tendencies already by offering courses in English. Therefore, why would the most skilled people in the world continue to come here?

2010 was not the time, as you think. People had no idea of the shitstorm that awaited them, and probably still don't. We'll see what happens in the next couple of years but I doubt that the average working person will be happy to vote tory next time around.

OK, with the Trident thing I think that it's more important to use the defence budget to keep that 2% thing going. The Tories have refused to commit to that, and should that budget go below the 2% mark then you will see some very angry NATO members indeed.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;Our story begins, as these stories often do, with an up-and-coming politician. She's a deeply religious woman and a member of the Conservative party.  

&gt;She is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, her party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'.   

&gt;At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination.   

&gt;The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims.   

&gt;Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider.  

&gt;He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant.   

&gt;Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle.   

&gt;Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear.  

&gt;A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.
