Many obious choices seem to be already tied to bigger clubs. Is there anyone from Eredivisie?

Mortality associated with certain conditions. glasgow blatchford , SIRS / APACHE and all of these scoring systems exist for hunreds of conditions as well as parameters like BP , pulse etc etc.
. If a person comes in with a condition of severity x and their mortality is much higher than a comparable hospital look at why. This is done in many papers already.
The severity means that you dont get slammed for seeing a lot of patients who may just be very ill- scoring systems provide a rough indicator of a prognostic marker so to speak.

Average time to see patients - of course - it should be included but at the moment it is the be all and end all of A&amp;E departments - see the example I gave where you discharge people purely to meet the numbers, and that bbc link furthers that.

days spent in hospital after admission - assess the hospital based on the care the patient received. If patients all require ICU intervention or are in hospital for much longer than national average for disease severity of x somewhere in the link something is being done badly, it may be the case that late diagnosis in A&amp;E is causing increased mortality or increased hospital stays.

In addition, true human motivations are still mostly unknown.  There are some flawed studies that suggest we tend more towards altruism than self-interest, but these are focused on young children who are not fully developed, physically or mentally.  It is hard to argue that we have no natural self-interest (indeed a lot of 'altruism' is explainable by kin theory and long-term self interest).  

As to your two points: 

* People most certainly will innovate without financial incentive.  However, they generally demand or seek benefits of some kind.  Anti-Capitalists fail to understand that influence, reputation, power, sex and so on are economies as well, just as much as physical resources or services are.  

* Competition can absolutely exist in a non-capitalist framework.  Sports teams still existed in Soviet Russia.  There was still competition under Feudalism.  Market Socialism or forms of Mutualism would preserve most elements of capitalism except private ownership of means of production (though it, too, would result in massive inequality and has numerous flaws).  

Competition is ultimately natural as long as there is scarcity of any kind- of food, of water, of resources, of attractive mates etc... We can draw a direct line from survival instinct to self interest.  Eliminating the latter is impossible without eliminating the former.  And while self-interest is compatible with socialism on a small scale (eg. in isolated communes or in tribal societies), it is highly questionable whether it is compatible in civilisations of tens of millions of people.

That sounds reasonable. The headline kinda doesn't.

Anyway I gave up smoking nearly two weeks ago now....certainly wasn't advertising or any number of campaigns that made me want to stop - it was the visible effects on my health that did it...being out of breath, tired, low stamina in general....I figured this isn't right at 34 years old, and decided I was a bit sick of it.

So far, so good. Off the patches today actually...they seemed to just be prolonging the cravings, to be honest.

I think he would have been watching, monitoring and planning for weeks in advance of the meeting and based on evidence he has seen, decided to take a course of action to rectify issues he has seen in the management of the squad. I don't think the decision to part ways with Marsh and Pascoe was because of scapegoating or because they were bad at their job; from what we have heard they are very good at their job. I think that it is was their relationship with Brendan that ultimately led LFC to part ways with them. The inability to disagree with Brendan or contradict what he was doing when he makes a bad decision (And he has made some baffling ones with player management, tactics etc.). I think FSG want someone working with Brendan who will speak up, tap Brendan on the shoulder and say, ""Mate, I think you need to rethink this situation, you are about to stuff this up"".

Bold St is chock-full of cheap, independent eateries ranging from Moroccan to Caribbean. It's also right in the center of town.

At the top of Bold St is the Bombed Out Church. During my first week here I was told to meet someone there and spent ages looking for a pile of rubble, but in reality it's just a church with no roof. At night the windows glow in different colors and they host events ranging from meditation to gigs. Tons of character!

Although religious buildings don't interest me I would say you should 100% check out both cathedrals, one on each end of Hope St, which is a couple mins' walk from Bold St. One is like a giant space ship and you can do the Rocky run on the stairs outside, and the other is just freaking huge.

null,false,TheBobbyDude,null,null,null,"Aguero is amazing at poaching... Mainly because everything he does is with a purpose and straight to the point. He is unimaginable clinical.   He is smarter than every defender around him and he can thread needles with his shots.  

But to say he is best as a poacher is wrong I think.  I get what you're saying because peligrini played him all alone up top a lot and so he would just wait at the halfway line for long balls.  Much of this season I wanted him to come back and get involved in the link up play more but he didn't which frustrated me. 

And it frustrated me because his link up play is pretty incredible.  He just needs teammates who think like him aka silva.  If he had a few more players like that around him and another striker to hold the burden of keeping pressure on the back line then you see Aguero at his finest. 

Aguero with negredo in 13/14 you see the real Aguero.  His dribbling skills are immense, defenders can never one on one him because he has become somewhat messi like with his foot skills.  The ball is glued to his foot.  He knows exactly how to throw a defender off balance, making enough space to burst three yards and then thread the needle with bullet speed and precision.  Most poachers don't do that.  

I think next season with a some more creative players in the team and a new striker in Bony we will see Aguero dropping back and linking up in build up play which he didn't do so much this year. 

Also poachers don't typically create their own goals and that's aguero's stand out trait.. He will have multiple defenders on him and then create his own goal from a hopeless situation nearly every time.  That's his most unique attribute.  Winning in hopeless situations.

The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of football players within the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) (EU).

&gt;The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract [without a transfer fee being paid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_transfer_(soccer\)).

&gt;The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player [Jean-Marc Bosman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marc_Bosman):

Sure, he has helped us knick a few goals over the seasons and played a large part in our success. But I think city fans may have some ""blue tinted shades"" when it comes to dzeko..

Aside from his occasional goal, he provides quite little. 

Not great movement, never is going to beat/turn his man unless its on the flanks, and that is not where we want a striker like him. His touch is god awful, really. Shows way too much of the ball to the defenders, his hold up play leaves a lot to be desired.

He is hard to pin down. Almost a finesse forward, more of a goal poacher. But in the modern game, it really takes more than just being able to poach a few goals now and then.

Now with injuries, age.. 

I know we won't recoup a large fee for him, and its always difficult trying to find a striker who is willing to spend a fair amount of time on the bench, competing with top players..

It would be a bit sad seeing dzeko leave, as he seems a very nice fella and has helped the club progress.

Aspiring to be the deepest squad in world football seems a bit pointless since it would take years if not decades to get there. It's also not like Chelsea don't have depth. One of the world's best keepers, one of last season's best LBs and one of Serie A's best right wingers from the past few seasons are all currently squad players at Chelsea. You expect a bit more depth in midfield and in defence since there are lots of roles there and you need players with different attributes for different tactical set ups. I really hope Mourinho does make a couple of big signings in those positions for depth and tactical variance, but it just seems unrealistic to ask for another expensive striker for a system which almost never plays with two strikers and doesn't have enough money to just buy in all the talent it needs.

It was the Master who would refuse. But here in the Planet of Fire, the Doctor pretty much sets up the events which cause the Master to ""die"" and even when the Master pleads for his life the Doctor does nothing. And it seems to affect him quite a bit. He isn't just letting an enemy die but a dear old friend too. He is obviously conflicted about the decision but the last time he allowed an enemy to live he got the resolution from Resurrection of the Daleks.I mean it is even underrated by the writing/production staff. They don't even really address the emotional fallout of it at all when the Master turns up alive later which I think was a mistake.

If fairly low I would get a gtx 960 or the upcoming r9 370 for around £130. A bigger HDD is simple, do you have a disk copier? If so, simply buy a new hard drive like a western digital 2TB, plug that in to the disk copier with your current disk, plug into secondary computer and run, you will end up with two identical disks that can be used, you may then need to format the rest of the drive through a piece of software like GPARTED when plugged in :) You can also use 'dixml,' and 'partitionmagic.'
Your PSU is most likely fine, novatech generally offer long warrenties so long as you haven't done anything stupid with it, and 750w is more than enough for a system like yours, however if you still want to 'upgrade' go with a trusted brand like Corsair, Fractal Design, or Silverstone for an added fee.
Hope this helped.

#The Koreans

* Seoul was founded in 4000 BC by Sejong the Great several miles away from Uluru and next to 4 deposits of salt.

 - This allowed Seoul to grow very quickly; it had 232,000 citizens by 3050 BC, and Busan, Jeonju, and Daegu were all settled by 2880 BC.
* However, Ashurbanipal, leader of Assyria, the only other civilization on the continent coveted lands that Sejong currently owned. 
 - He amassed an army of spearmen, composite bowmen, and warriors and sent them into Seoul, which he took over by 2550 BC. Half the population of Seoul were killed and Sejong was killed. Soon after, Ashurbanipal defeated the Korean Empire.

#The Polish
* Casimir III founded Warsaw in 4000 BC. However, there were very few luxury resources in the starting area, so the early Polish Empire was plagued by unhappiness and starvation.

 - However, one of his scouts discovered the Fountain of Youth nearby, and their happiness increased literally tenfold. 

* He took over Assur in 1876 BC, and Assyria's capital became Seoul.
 
* Poland stayed relatively dormant until 1360 AD, when they discovered the radio and then adopted the order ideology, becoming the first communist state. They spread their ideology once other civilizations entered the modern era and adopted their own ideologies. This led to the 2006 bill which made the world ideology order.

Long version:
The number of non ""selling clubs"" in the EPL is currently... 5?

ManU, ManCity, Chelsea, 'Pool (but closer than I'd have thought three years ago), Arsenal... 
Spurs fans would say they aren't, but they are - it's just a matter of the price being right. 

Everyone else - given the price being right, they'll sell. The financial benefits reaped by selling a star player that would just force their way out in a year or so anyway outweigh the benefits of having an amazing talent who is upset by being on say, West Brom's squad. 

Buying: There are probably 10-15 ""Buying"" sides in the whole world, 
Neutral: 5 or so squads with the financial and social capitol to not be forced into selling a player they don't want to (of note, holding out for 11 months and then selling isn't the same thing), 
and then
Selling: every other squad in the world is a selling squad - just a matter of the right buyer appearing. 

Example - River Plate/Boca Juniors likely wouldn't sell to anyone in South America, but if Abramovich were to show up with a bag of money, they'd sell. 

We are in the selling category, at the moment there aren't a great number of players on the squad that other sides in the EPL are interested in acquiring - we have a solid squad, say, potentially top 7 were a whole season to go the way the Jan-May 2015 campaign went... but if a talent like Rooney/Bale/Owen, or even a good-not-great player were to come through the academy, a larger squad would buy them sooner or later.

&gt; I have been reporting on issues of drug use for BBC television since the 1990s. When I hear that the Local Government Association has called for an outright ban on legal highs, I recall how often I have heard drug specialists, academics, lawyers and police officers tell me that prohibition does not bring about the result society would like. Prohibition of alcohol in 1920s America spawned a vast network of speakeasies and Mafia criminals. Prohibition of drugs has not brought the drug trade to an end; it continues to be one of the world’s most established criminal enterprises.

&gt; I understand that local authorities are hoping that the Bill, once passed, will enable the closure of head shops, which, among their other goods, sell what are called legal highs—out in the open. This is exactly where they need to be: where they can be identified and monitored rather than being driven underground, where they will fuel another criminal network.

&gt; What resources in money and manpower will be made available to tackle the criminal activities that will result from a blanket ban? All psychoactive substances need regulation, which is why we have strict rules governing the distribution and availability of alcohol. In a recent BBC “Panorama”, I reported on the major crisis of alcohol-related illnesses among the old. When I subsequently asked, in this House, whether the Government would consider a minimum pricing policy in England to limit the damage that those who would so self-harm can do, the Government refused. Such a policy operates in Scotland, which has seen a fall in alcohol-related deaths. I would like the Government to explain the paradox of being so ready to ban substances sampled by so few, while refusing modest moves against other acknowledged dangerous drugs enjoyed by so many.

&gt; In seeking to regulate psychoactive substances, examples are often given—as we have heard several times—of what happened in Ireland and is happening in Poland. I have the same statistics and will not repeat them, but it would be worth the Minister examining in some detail exactly what is going on in Ireland and Poland, and then giving us the up-to-date information.

&gt; I look forward to Committee, where we can explore in more detail the ways to regulate NPS and inform and educate all our citizens about the risks that they might consider taking. We have a fine example of a drug control that we might follow. The campaign to reduce smoking is an ongoing success. Steadily and thoroughly, generations have now grown up knowing the risks that smoking brings and seeing on packages and in retail shop notices a constant reminder of the risks they must live with. I am eager for the Government to pursue a policy that brings forward such an informed awareness in the young about the continuing temptation of NPS.

This article is just shit stirring. Schools have had this software in place for fucking years, if not Impero then something like Securus. And you know what? Its completely fucking necessary. 

When you drop your little darlings off at school you give over a duty of care to said children, meaning the school has a responsibility to ensure the child is in a protected environment. Guess what? The internet isn't a lovely land of rainbows and sunshine, you categorically need software like Impero because its the best at what it does. Its basically a glorified word list that integrates with AD, you set the policy that you want, i.e. the word ""porn"" and in the event of that word appearing on someones screen it will send a little prompt to the admin, it will also normally take a screenshot or start recording their screen. It can close the window on their computer, it can blank their screen or disable their mouse/keyboard inputs. Its fantastic at what it does.

It comes prepackaged with words like ""cutting"" or ""self harm"" because its specifically designed for a school environment where young teenagers may be experiencing abuse or bullying so i ask is it still wrong to track these kind of things? It will also flag up extremist content by default (which is no different from what the guardian is saying its only implementing now) whether it be about ISIS or the KKK.

Now as 1984 as this sounds, because of said duty of care us horrible Nazi Mods are 100% forced to use this software because if little Timmy stumbles on videos of people getting their heads cut off and doesn't like it and tells his parents you can bet your bottom dollar they will be down at the school in a flash complaining.


As totally lovely (and time saving) it would be to not have to implement these policies on the entire network, if you're under 18 then no you probably shouldn't be looking at GTA V, school is also not a good place for gambling, watching porn, torrenting or using TOR.

null,false,Frose91,cnty-uk,London,null,"The reason they aren't applying or having a job is not because they are lazy or don't want to succeed. That's what you don't seem to get. Forget about the people on disability and the people abusing the system, they are a minority! Almost invisible even! This isn't about attitude, this is about a broken system.

Suppose you graduate from university with a masters. You start looking for the job you worked so hard for but find there aren't a lot of them. The standard requirement for a job is 3 years of experience. No one will hire you, so you can't get those 3 years of experience. You're basically going in circles. Now what? You can't get another job either because no one will hire you as you're overqualified. You can't do an apprenticeship either as you won't survive 6 months without pay. So you just spent 4 years at university and there's no job to be found.... Must be the bad attitude, right?

Now suppose you weren't lucky enough to be able to graduate for whatever reason. You've been working two minimum wage jobs, 70 hours a week just to be able to pay the rent. You know you'd earn more on jobseekers but you struggle on because you'd rather work than abuse the system. At one point you break, can't go anymore, completely burnt out. This has to stop. You decide to go on jobseekers hoping you'll find another job. You don't find another job and wind up being depressed. You're not applying as much as you should, but even getting out of bed is a task at this point. You don't go on disability because you still want a job, you want to work but you see no way out. Also the bad attitude, right?

Do you know why I had to set up my own company? Because no one would hire me. I was extremely good at my job at a very young age, but no one wanted to hire someone my age. Not old enough to lead a team, they said. Talented, but I should apply again in a few years time because people who had been doing the job for 20 years were as good as me and people would actually listen to them. I was so extremely lucky that my dad had the funds and time/energy to help me set everything up. Without that, there's a very real chance I would have been in one of those situations. Even today people who don't know me think I'm too young to do my job, to lead. But not everyone can set up their own company, most people would have to continue searching.

Don't you get that none of this is attitude? That this is because of a broken system rather than the person who's out of a job? All of those people you are judging have a story, their own reasons it isn't working out and problems. They tried, but somehow nothing goes right. The wrong place, the wrong time, too young, too old, not the right contacts, not enough experience, overqualified,... We don't need psychologists or attitude readjustments, we need a better economy, a system that works, jobs that actually pay, a real support network that doesn't make you feel guilty for failing but encourages you to keep going until finally something works out...

The apprenticeship is available for the graduate's qualifications but it's unpaid so they can't do it. There are a few great jobs available but you need 3 years of experience, how is this person supposed to do what it takes? How will this person avoid ending up on jobseekers?

For the person who never graduated you could argue that those two jobs they did were available for their qualifications, but the conditions are so bad this person can't keep working like this.

Are you saying that even if everyone in the country were to have a job, the lowest paid members of our society don't deserve empathy just because they weren't clever enough to graduate or had problems along the way? Should we leave the weaker people in our society behind, should they have to work in these conditions even though they can't help it if they're not very clever or the school system failed them? The jobs they do are important, these people deserve to be paid well, helped, and respected just like any other member of society.

• Lowering the voting age would get people involved with Politics at an earlier age. This helps educate and inform young people better on the cornerstone of society (democracy). It may help to combat voter apathy if people can be engaged in politics from a younger age.

• By lowering the voting age you are not just giving 16 year olds the vote. Currently, some people will get their first say in how the UK is run aged 22/23 (if they turned 18 the day after the previous election). With a new system, the oldest someone could be would be 21 for their first vote. I think we would agree that is a fairer system for those who are a year young on election day.

• Finally, this would mean many more people are still at school for their first vote. This means schools can help kids get on the electoral register and could even take students to the polling booth as a class.

• Lowering the voting age would get people involved with Politics at an earlier age. This helps educate and inform young people better on the cornerstone of society (democracy). It may help to combat voter apathy if people can be engaged in politics from a younger age.

• By lowering the voting age you are not just giving 16 year olds the vote. Currently, some people will get their first say in how the UK is run aged 22/23 (if they turned 18 the day after the previous election). With a new system, the oldest someone could be would be 21 for their first vote. I think we would agree that is a fairer system for those who are a year young on election day.

• Finally, this would mean many more people are still at school for their first vote. This means schools can help kids get on the electoral register and could even take students to the polling booth as a class. This means they don't have to rely on parents who may be as apathetic as we assume all 16 year olds are.

null,false,TomTheElder,null,null,null,"&gt; In all the big European and EPL games Last season Jose seemed to want more control of the midfield than Matic and Fabregas offer alone. Usually this meant dropping Oscar and playing either Mikel, Ramires, or even Zouma.

I actually think he did this for the opposite reason, in a way. It's a big myth that you win the midfield with physicality and defensive qualities. You dominate it with quality in possession, and ability to break pressure. This is why the two teams in Europe who most dominate the midfield (Barca &amp; Bayern) play with a high intelligence, high skill, low athleticism, low defensiveness midfield.

Jose brings on Ramires, Mikel, and Zouma because he knows we will struggle to dominate the midfield against the very best teams: we just aren't a team set up to do that. Those three guys are *much* more useful when you won't dominate midfield, because they are great at screening the back four (also Ramires is useful on the counter which is how you will end up playing when you lose the possession battle).

So I think the question is do we want to shore up our counterattacking style or do we want to try and boss the midfield on the biggest occasions? If it's the former then sure, get another athletic box-to-box player. If it's the latter, then we need genuine quality in our signing.",null,0,null,1433964183,null,0,false,0,cs245i4,null,t3_397z64,null,t1_cs245i4,null,t1_cs14o3p,null,null,null,1436884300,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

I did my little routine of testing all of my pens and putting them in my exam pencil case at home ([one of the ones with a sliding zip](http://www.isources.com/ProductStore/59/b-zip-lock%20pencil%20case.jpg)). When I got to school, the sports hall was freezing - even colder than normal. We got through all of the ""check your pockets for mobile phones"" stuff with no problems. Then, the head invigilator told us to fill in the details on the cover.

I reached for a pen, and quickly realised that I couldn't open my pencil case. I wrestled with it for about a minute, while everyone else was writing their name. I put my hand up, and told the invigilator that I couldn't open my pencil case. He didn't believe me, so he tried opening it, with similar results. The thing just wouldn't open.

At this point, a really old invigilator noticed that something was up. She also tried to open my pencil case, and mentioned that in the 20-odd years that she'd been an invigilator, nothing like this had happened before. By now, everyone else in the hall had written their details, and all eyes were on me. The first invigilator found the scratchiest biro known to humankind, and gave that to me instead.

At random points in the exam, invigilators stopped and stared at my pencil case. Before we were dismissed at the end, another one tried to open it.

When I got home, the first thing I did was try to open my pencil case. It opened without a problem - it was just the cold stopping the slider from working.

And when you're met by scorn and vilification,  by all means respond with defiance, but also kindness and empathy.  If you have patience and wisdom,  you can change these outdated ideas with your actions and words.  That is the best way to bring about meaningful change.  

Hence why I question how effective a film like this really is though at bringing about this kind of change.  I think it fails to show positive cases as my own,  which may lead to a warped percection amongst viewers. You need to give hope as well as highlight the problem, and to me this leans to far on one side of the debate - a populous view that seeks to demonise Muslims. I don't think that was the reporter intention,  but certainly many Muslims will see it as that,  particularly those who harbour such views.

In my opinion, he's a no-brainer. He's going to be a world class talent eventually and Monaco might be willing to sell for a half decent offer. I'd be happy to see pretty much anything thrown at him because it's a solid investment.

* **Firmino** - Hoffenheim - 23 years old, second striker.

He was my favourite player to watch in the Bundesliga last season, although he's suffered through Hoffenheim's poor season this year. I think he could easily grow into Suarez's place. He's got an eye for goal, he could easily become a very deadly striker. City &amp; United both want him apparently, so he'd cost an excessive amount.

* **Gregory Van Der Wiel** - Paris Saint Germain - 27 years old, Right back.

He's quick, he's good going forward, he's defensively reliable, a step up from Glen Johnson and he's only been displaced by Serge Aurier this year who has been amazing to his credit. 

* **Mat Ryan** - Club Brugge - 24 years old, goal keeper.

Quality distribution is something we don't get with Mignolet and I'm not holding out hope of that improving any time soon. Ryan is yet to come into his goalkeeping prime, but his distribution is nothing short of excellent. I'd certainly prefer him to Bogdan.

* **Aleksander Mitrovic** - RSC Anderlecht, 20 years old, striker. 

Mitrovic has a reported £15million release clause. He's younger, more versatile and a little cheaper than Benteke. So if we're going to splurge on a target man, I'd rather see us go for Mitrovic who can score goals. He's an excellent player inside the box, great movement and has the world at his feet at this point.

**OR**

* **Domenico Berardi** - Juventus, 20 years old, forward.

If we're running away from the idea of a proper *traditional* center forward, I'd love to see us lodge a bid for Berardi. He played as a right winger for Sassuolo this season on loan, but he doesn't fit Juve's hard-working, defensively sound winger archetype. He's almost certainly not going to get many games ahead of Tevez, Morata, Llorente &amp; Dybala. 31 goals in 61 at the age of 20 is **ridiculous**. I think this kid is something special, seems to have a hunger for the game and I don't see why he couldn't grow into a Suarez-type striker given a few years.

Takeaways and Order at the Counter type places (this can be everything from McDonalds to pubs to Nandos): No you don't really tip. You can tip delivery drivers but it's more often a case of ""Keep the Change out of a £20 note"" rather than ""Here's £20 for the food, and £2 for you."" (in my experience this also applies to taxi drivers). There's no obligation to though, and a lot of people might find it a bit awkward if you try and give them a tip, especially in somewhere like McDonalds or Subway.

For an Eat-In type restaurant, again, I generally would go for around 10% for a tip if I was leaving one. Leaving a tip is entirely optional though, and it's really more based on the service you received and  whether you think the staff deserve it. A lot of places will give you the option of adding a tip onto the bill if you're paying by card, but this often isn't given directly to the staff directly, so that's something to bear in mind.

Pubs: Basically, unless you're either a local/regular at the pub, or you've made good friends with the bar staff whilst you've been there; don't tip. Again, most bar staff will find it weird if you as a random person start tipping them. At bars the same rules apply really, but also they're generally going to be busy, and tipping will slow down the service, so you may well end up annoying the staff by trying to tip them.

In terms of things to avoid/rules to stick to when out and about (not just going out for a meal), the main thing is just don't be a dick. We're a friendly lot really, even if we do seem a little quiet and reserved. If you're polite and not too loud or patronising, then you won't have any problems. Some smaller places might have some specific little customs or similar, but I can't really think of any off the top of my head. If you're not sure, just ask.

Don't queue jump, try and avoid calling things quaint or cute, and again just avoid being a dick. If you wouldn't do it at home, don't do it here. The only other thing I can think of would be don't try and use slang/expressions that you'll hear people saying. I've heard many a tourist try and say ""Alright mate?"" or similar and it just seems unnatural. 

Finally, yeah excuse me is a perfectly fine way to try and get some help or attention. You might find people are a little confused by being called Sir or Ma'am, as it's quite formal, and doesn't really get used that much outside of higher end shops/restaurants. ""Excuse me"" by itself will be fine, or even ""Hi, can I ask a quick question?"". 

I hope you enjoy your trip, and feel free to give us a shout if you have any other questions. I feel like you might be from North America from all the tipping related questions, so if you've got any other queries about the differences between here/there, feel free to ask away!

Oh, one last very important thing (adding this because I just saw another poster mention knives). Don't bring a knife, or if you absolutely must, bring a small Swiss army knife style knife, rather than something that is entirely a blade for a blade's sake. In the UK, carrying a non-locking knife over 3"" long in public, without a good reason (camping/work/etc) is illegal. Locking blades are illegal to carry in public full stop. Unless you have a very good reason for it, it's advisable to not carry a knife on you as it can lead to both a large fine and/or a prison sentence.

Biking would be a good option. What I do frequently as I have a free train pass is go to one station and then walk to another and get a train home. With Brit Rail Pass for around $800 you could definitely get a train to one station and cycle another. I am not fit enough to do so but it would definitely be a great experience on a bike. I know $800 sounds a lot but for a whole month, if you are going to be getting at least 1 or 2 trains a day it would definitely save you money. Beware of the ""advance tickets"" mentioned. They are cheaper for a reason, some often have to be used for specific trains and specific times. It's ""use it or lose it"" on those ones, there is very rarely any flexibility if you miss the train.

Firstly the quote in his book is ""some people say it was a controlled explosion"", some people - not necessarily him.

His first point is that we have so little trust in our media and politicians that we need to keep our mind open to any possibilities. That's not saying it was a conspiracy, but that we should keep our mind open to conspiracies. 


Then he says he thinks it's interesting the relationship the Bush family have had for years with the Bin Laden family, and the way the media report things with an anti-Islam bias, and how these terrorism attacks are used to enforce further controls on the public through things like the snooper charter.


He said these things, because those are the things he thinks people should be talking about, he then dismisses the claim that the American government did it by calling it a ""daft conspiracy theory"".

Every patient interaction-- at least by senior medical and nursing staff-- is guided by professional knowledge and constant risk assessment. There are whole departments in every Trust to review the activity and mortality data you suggest you'd introduce.

The 4 hour target is a positive measure and has been associated with huge improvements in A&amp;E care. Any patients with conditions that can't be managed in that timescale should move elsewhere be it AMU, STU, GAU, HDU etc where they can, allowing A&amp;E to manage accidents and emergencies. If the patient needs to stay in A&amp;E for clinical reasons then they should and do-- and Jeremy Cunt can FTFO with his target.

A poor A&amp;E 4-hour target almost never reflects poor performance of the A&amp;E department itself. Rather is is more reflective of the state of the hospital as a whole. If patients needing further clinical input haven't anywhere to go because of capacity problems elsewhere (""No beds"") then that's not of A&amp;E's making, it's inevitably because well patients can't be discharged to make way.

Looking at the facts,  there are 30 times more homicides in the UK a year then there terrorism convictions.  (600 vs 20). 

And of course a city as big as London is bound to draw most of these,  as there are statistically speaking far more Muslims living there then anywhere else in the UK. It would be more useful to look at a statistic that measures radicalisation based on population density. 

Ultimately this figure is bound to be far smaller then other types of extremism in the Uk, yet do you hold that same sentiment for groups likes Britian First?

To you I say this: there is no need to fear Muslims in their entirety because of the very tiny chance that a few you meet may hold ""radical views"". There is also little evidence to show that extremist thought always leads to acts of violence.

&gt; How much do I tip at a sit-down-and-order restaurant?

If you are given the bill after you eat then you have the option to tip (about 10%) then (but you don't have to). If you order food in a pub you will typically pay at the bar when you order, so then you don't tip unless you really want to (there might be a jar on the bar), don't tip if you order drinks. We have a different culture to tipping, excessive tipping and other signs of wealth are often viewed as distasteful.

&gt; Pubs - how common is it to buy the barkeep a round? Can I tip or is that a no-no?

Basically never, I mean you can, but its pretty weird, I've never known anyone I know to do it. Old creepy guys buy hot barmaids drinks, but they basically never take the drink it, they'll just take the money. They will appreciate it, but they'll also think you're weird. 

&gt; If I'm eating at a family run restaurant/cafe in the country, are there any rules of etiquette I must keep in mind?

The number 1 thing americans do is talk really really loudly, and particularly talk really loudly about other people or things. So just really tone down your voice, talking really loudly about how beautiful things are is considered funny to us, its sweet because you're being complementary, but it also is a classic american tourist trait (i.e. walk into the small cafe and boom ""OH MY GOD LOOK HOW QUAINT IT IS!!"". I know people who are considered quiet in the US, but are super loud in the UK. 

&gt; Are there are absolutely horrific things foreigners do that I must not? (I know I mustn't cut queues).

Nothing really, there are lots of foreign people in the UK, just be polite. Saying ""alright"" is a greeting like ""how are you"", you respond with ""yeah, you"" or something similar

&gt; Can I draw someone's attention by saying ""Excuse me, sir/ma'am""? Or is there a better way?

lol, don't call people sir or ma'am, its considered weird, we have actually sir's and ma'am's (people with knighthoods) and they aren't the average man on the street. ""Excuse me...do you know the way to the tower of london"" is fine. Or if you're about to in any way inconvenience someone then ""I'm sorry...do you know the way to the tower of london"" is also nice.

&gt;

&gt;The __Hubble Space Telescope__ (__HST__) is a [space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_observatory) that was launched into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) in 1990, and remains in operation. With a 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) mirror, Hubble's four main instruments observe in the [near ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_ultraviolet), [visible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), and [near infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_infrared) [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). The telescope is named after the [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer) [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble).

&gt;Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere) allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with negligible [background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_(astronomy\)) light. Hubble has recorded some of the most detailed [visible-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics), such as accurately [determining the rate of expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Using_Hubble_space_telescope_data).

&gt;Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy). The HST was built by the United States space agency [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), with contributions from the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency), and is operated by the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Telescope_Science_Institute). The HST is one of NASA's [Great Observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Observatories_program), along with the [Compton Gamma Ray Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory), the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory), and the [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope).

null,false,thatcambridgebird,null,null,null,"Cambridge-specific advice :) - if you're doing the tourist thing, please please please don't feel pressured by the punt touts (the guys with boards who'll come up to you and say ""are you punting today?"" or otherwise try and persuade you to go on an overpriced boat trip). They're only after their cut of commission. I promise you, as a local, that you will have far more fun if you pay to hire your own punt instead and boat down the river under your own steam. Yes, you will crash a lot. Yes you will probably be complete crap. But you'll save a lot of money, have fun, and still see beautiful buildings and sights. If they ask which route you'd like at the desk (they should offer the Backs, or Grantchester) then in your limited visit I'd recommend the Backs, because you'll see all of the colleges and so on. 

Afterwards, a nice pub to sit at is The Eagle - extremely touristy, but look it up on Wikipedia and see why :). 

If you have time in your trip, go to Grantchester. Again, quite touristy - because of the association with Rupert Brooke, the war poet, amongst other things - but well worth it.
 
Final word of advice - if you do go punting and the punt pole gets stuck, LET GO! (and that's not a euphemism!) I've seen so many people fall in trying to rescue it - and believe me, you don't want to fall in and swallow a mouthful of the Cam ;) ",null,0,null,1433968834,null,0,false,0,cs27l4w,null,t3_39c11k,null,t1_cs27l4w,null,t3_39c11k,null,null,null,1436887108,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

Evidence please.

&gt;""Vaping"" is not a valid cheat to get away with smoking in public.

No one said it was. It's not smoking, it's an alternative. 



&gt;Why can't you show respect and refrain from your addiction until you're in the privacy of your own home?

Why should I when it's not actually harming anyone else? I mean I don't vape in restaurants and I keep it away from people in general but why should it be banned in all public spaces? Why shouldn't I be able to vape in a nightclub or venue for example ( which is also where I mainly work )  when it's the same stuff that's coming out of the smoke machine or hazer? 


&gt;And what's the problem?

The problem is that it's not smoking and you're trying to say that it's the same thing without the evidence to back that up.

The fundamental research will have been done there and that may have shown a promising compound, but they will have signed a partnership with a pharma company to bring that research forward.

Not enough - it's frighteningly expensive to bring a drug to market from the lab.

For every hundred compounds that leave a University, only one may ever make it to the market and even then it may be no better than the current market leader.

To even get to that point, you have to spend all the money to research and test the other promising compounds that didn't make it.

Some interesting Southampton related data in this report. 

**Players Out related;**

Of the top 100 big-5 league players with **greatest probability of a transfer**, the highest ranked Saint is ... **Graziano Pelle** #51 (surprise!) with a value of @ €15 million, then **Nathaniel Clyne**#71 (no surprise) a value of @ €20 million.

In the list of the top 100 big-5 league players with the **highest transfer values** the only Saint is #51 **Sadio Mane** with a value of €31 to €35 million (wow, stunned). The report has  Sadio at a medium level of likelihood of transfer, which is unfortunately the same level as David de Gea! Not sure how much we paid for Sadio, but I believe that means his value increased at least 30% in less than a year, which has to make Saints an attractive destination for other players?

Also of note several of our potential players out, do not make the top 100 with greatest probability of transfer, maybe that means they are less likely to leave? If we have to replace any players we should certainly look at the bargain list of players out of contract or with less tan a year left, some good DM's in those lists in case of emergency. Funnily enough no mention of **Osvaldo** in either greatest probability or highest value list :)-.

**Players In related;**

Of the top 100 big-5 league players with **greatest probability** of a transfer **Charlie Austin** is rated **#1** with a €10 million price tag, I think that means Saints will have to compete hard and maybe even pay more to get him? Next are **Stefano Okaka** and **Saido Berahino** at #37 an #38 respectively, but with Stefano @ €6 million and Saido @ **€20 million**.

Saints are not linked to any of the players in the top 100 big-5 league players with the highest transfer values. But a surprise at #85 **Calum Chambers** @  €25! Which I think means Arsenal made money on him already? If Toby leaves do we have a buy back clause on Calum, or maybe get him back on loan? Also if Gareth Bale keeps falling in value the way he did this year, we might be able to buy him back next year :)-.",null,0,null,1433969164,null,0,1433972895,0,cs27tsy,null,t3_374oc4,null,t1_cs27tsy,null,t3_374oc4,null,null,null,1437561455,null,1,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,1,null

Why should it matter if 50,000 people turn up and make a loud noise?  They could all still be wrong.  If I saw a large crowd of people protesting e.g. how evil abortion is, it wouldn't change my mind and stop me from being pro-choice.  

As far as I'm concerned, the *only* reason anyone should change their mind about anything is if the quality of the argument is sufficient to convince you of its merits.  And you don't need a crowd to do that - just one person with a good enough argument.

Having said that, I think there may be a case when it comes to disadvantaged minority groups whose voice is not normally heard.  If you can't get your views published or get any air-time because of discrimination then perhaps a big noisy protest is your only non-violent option.   But, even then, I think that it's still important to have people who can actually articulate an argument.  Marching is not enough.

null,false,AiHangLo,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"e-cigs deliver nicotine to the brain, the action of the nicotine releases norepinephrine into the bloodstream, and the norepinephrine causes systemic vasoconstriction. Over long time periods this chronic vasoconstriction increases the rate of arteriosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries that occurs to a certain extent in all people as they age. It causes problems with the heart since the arteries don't stretch as easily when blood surges through them. Everyone gets it eventually, and chronic nicotine use causes it to develop at a younger age.
Atherosclerosis is chronic inflammation of the artery wall that accompanies the binding of excess LDL and vLDL cholesterol which eventually lead to plaque build up. Most strokes are ischemic strokes caused by a blood clot, which usually forms at the plaque site and eventually becomes dislodged. The other major category of stroke is hemorrhagic stroke which occurs when cerebral arteries burst due to excessive cerebral arterial blood pressure or weakness of the arterial wall, or both. Ischemic strokes (and most heart attacks) are related to atherosclerosis, while hemorrhagic strokes are more related to arteriosclerosis.
Tobacco use, like e-cigarettes, delivers the arteriosclerosis-hastening nicotine, but it also contributes directly to atherosclerosis because of the chronic, systemic inflammation caused by the various toxic and carcinogenic components of cigarette smoke and smokeless tobacco additives.
So, e-cigarettes do not have the same health risks as tobacco, and while they are in all likelihood considerably safer than tobacco over the long term, there's no reason to believe that they won't cause chronic hypertension as well. Probably not to the same degree as tobacco use, but I'm sure they'll be confirmed as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in time.
Side note: I realized that I answered a slightly different question than the one you asked, but I figured I'd leave up my comment because more people should know about this stuff.
Interesting fact about nicotine for those who bothered to read this far: long term tobacco/nicotine use significantly decreases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease

Complaining whilst sat there obviously seeing people with more serious issues than their chesty cough come in after them and seen before them.

I may have a broken finger and have been waiting for an hour to be seen when a child comes in gushing blood from a gash to their head. I can wait longer whilst they sort out the more serious cases first. I'm not going to complain and kick up a fuss because someone with a knife stuck in their chest comes in an hour after me and goes straight in.

If passed it can be repealed by future governments as they see fit, and I imagine most of them would see fit as it would stop preventative fiscal stimulus if it was required. 

So imagine for a moment the economy is growing (it is) and you are legally bound to maintain a surplus, would that make it unlawful for the government to, say, propose widespread tax cuts? And isn't that exactly what this government did in the Queens Speech? 

Let's pretend for a moment that the economy keeps growing, let's say it even reaches the dizzy height of 5% growth for some nominal sustained period, let's say a year. At the start of the next year some unexpected economic shock takes place. The banks being silly again, or some Eurozone nonsense, the root cause doesn't matter, this is a hypothetical. 

It becomes quickly apparent that growth is going to slow, if not end completely. Period 1 shows growth down to 2%, most forecasts are saying 1% next period and declining beyond that. Does the government of the day have to do nothing until we stop growing completely? That's just irresponsible.

Quite a lot of reports will be tax evasion, which is illegal therefore is reportable. This would more usually be investigated by HMRC, not the police. 

&gt; TI gave the example of a foreign official who had declared a salary of $100,000 a year putting £20m through a UK bank account. While such a transaction looks suspicious and clearly merits closer scrutiny, if the person requesting it has not been found guilty of stealing the money in their home country, the UK police would be unlikely to find enough evidence to block it; the transaction would therefore be marked “approved” and sail through the system.

This looks dodgy as fuck right? Except not really. A lot of people making $100k pa *salary* have their fingers in various legit pies, or come from private school and have large family wealth. Alternately he's brokering some kind of investment deal. The bank, agent or whoever is noticing this may not be in a position to enquire about how a guy on $100k pa manages to have £20m - at least not without risking ""tipping off"" the subject. So they consider it and decide to be on the safe side that this is more than speculation and it gets reported. 

Hence SOCA/NCA get swarmed with reports of which presumably 99% really are of very little value, and the other 1% is at risk of getting missed. I imagine that all these reports are really used for is when the individual being reported already has a red flag against their name, so it's more like a source of evidence than anything to identify brand-new intelligence. 

The legislation creates a huge drag net and this picks up a lot of garbage.

Wicker man. 

I'm not angry (but mostly sad). 27% of Britain (and mostly English...) voted Tory. Who cares? if it were Labour, UKIP or even Lib Dems there would be little difference between the lot of them. - Because, I'm not sure if anyone realises yet, but voting changes very very little. A part from what Oxford and Cambridge person gets to choose some things that do not change but for you or I. (Well unless you're part of the top 10%!?) 

And I wasn't being sarcastic... Most Tory voters that I know and whom are my friends usually are quite sad and depressive people who blame everything on someone else; 'welfare people stealing our tax', 'immigrants using our NHS'. It's all me me me and self indulgent... But then again we do come from a history of worldwide self indulgence and I too enjoy the fruits of that past.

There's much worse than hate threads there are niche subs on this website my pure innocent mind couldn't even contemplate. 


Word of advice, if you're ever deep in comments of a thread and see a variation of the question ""what's the most awful sub on Reddit"" or ""Whats the worst thing you've seen on reddit"" close down your internet...go outside. Please benifit from my experience.

The Squigy ones are quicker to put in and do the job fine, a plus being you don't need to roll them up like a sausage with dirty hands (my gloves are always filthy).

The Soundear set with wired speakers and a headphone jack are used when i'm not caning it and fancy a bit of music. Also I use them as headphones for the computer at home.

I like having the option both squidy and soundear as well as a big fuckoff bag of moldex depending on the situation. Riding around London I don't bother with earplugs at all now, only if there will be prolonged motorway work or for long trips/touring.

I doubt it.  The world is richer and healthier.  The dirty secret which THEY don't want you to know is that over the long run, things are generally getting better, and for more and more people.

Newspapers are very good at playing on our fears and taking every little upward blip as sign of a worrying trend which will lead to the downfall of humanity.  Plus, it's kind of their job to tell us about all the bad things that happen in the world.

Yes, there are some worrying stats quoted in this article, but apply some skeptical thinking.  How does the author know that this is related to 'aspirational parenting' as opposed to any number of other possibilities?  Seems to me like it's little more than the speculation.

Also - you have to be really careful with these sorts of stats.  Perhaps they're rising because we're now all more aware of a particular problem.  Or perhaps it's because parents or their children are more likely to seek out medical help.  Or maybe it's because doctors are more willing to make a diagnosis.

**At a takeaway or order-at-the-counter type place, do I tip? How much?**  
You're only expected to tip when eating in a restaurant that has table service. Even then, if the menu states that they take a service charge (usually in the small print at the bottom) you don't need to tip. Tipping when you're not expected to will often come across as a bit odd, if not creepy.

**How much do I tip at a sit-down-and-order restaurant?**  
10%, or thereabout. There's no need to work it out to the penny, so roughly to the nearest whole pound is fine. When paying with cash for the meal, most will often round the cost plus the tip up to an easy figure and leave the lot together for the staff to keep the change.

**Pubs - how common is it to buy the barkeep a round? Can I tip or is that a no-no?**  
The only people buying rounds for any of the staff in the pub would be friends of the staff. I'm sure they wouldn't mind the offer, but it'll most likely be politely turned down. I'm assuming that by ""barkeep"" you mean the landlord (as in the pub's owner). You don't normally tip in pubs, but a lot of pubs these days where food is paid for at the table and they have waiting staff can be treated as a restaurant as far as tipping is concerned. You don't need to tip the bar staff, and there's no need to tip if you pay for your meal before it is served.

**If I'm eating at a family run restaurant/cafe in the country, are there any rules of etiquette I must keep in mind?**  
Other than a few things that I'll point out at the bottom of this post, just treat it like any other restaurant. Tip if there's no service charge and you feel like they deserve one.

**Are there are absolutely horrific things foreigners do that I must not?**  
Sure, but they usually boil down to people just being a dick and we're just as bad when we're abroad. We know that you're American so we expect you to occasionally do American things and we'll probably just find it funny. Be careful where you say ""fanny"" though, as that means ""vagina"" over here.

Americans in particular are known for being loud, which is fine in a pub for example but not so good in a quiet restaurant. Try to keep your voice to a similar level to others in the room and you'll be fine. Oh and don't compare everything to the States. A stereotypical American will tend to reply to everything with a sentence along the lines of ""Well, in the States we..."" and it isn't appreciated.

**Can I draw someone's attention by saying ""Excuse me, sir/ma'am""? Or is there a better way?**  
Just ""excuse me"" is fine, but if you must say something after that use ""madam"" rather than ""ma'am"". It's old fashioned though and sounds a bit formal, so you'll usually only hear people use those terms when they're working. You'll be referred to as sir or madam by waiting staff, for example. If you need to get past somebody and they're in the way, ""excuse me, please"" is normal.

**Other stuff**

* If you're in a touristy area or a city, you'll find that people will be much more accommodating if you get things wrong. In the more remote areas where there aren't so many tourists, you'll find that as they're less used to foreign people making the odd mistake they might be a bit sharper with you. Trust me, they're just as bad with any English who don't have a local accent, so don't take it personally.
* If you're lost or otherwise stuck, feel free to ask a local but try not to just pick any random person on the street. The police are there to help, so if you see an officer (who obviously isn't busy chasing a criminal or something) feel free to ask them for directions. Another tip is to buy a can of coke or something from a nearby shop and ask whoever is behind the counter while they serve you.
* Tourist information centres. In tourist-heavy places like the Lake District you'll find one of these in each large town. Make use of them. They'll have leaflets, some of which will be free (ask first if it's not already stated) and they're manned by knowledgeable people who are more than willing to help.
* Please don't imitate us. Try not to pass off using English words as if you're trying to speak another language. I've seen people from all sorts of countries using words like ""mate"" and ""geezer"" in an attempt to fit in, and it just comes across as odd and slightly insulting. We watch a lot of American movies and know what you mean when you use American words, so if in doubt just resort to those. Apart from ""fanny"". Seriously, that word can get you into a lot of trouble if used in the wrong context.

As I mentioned before, we're not going to hold anything against you if you make any mistakes. You're likely to find that your accent will allow you to get away with Americanisms as we sort of expect it.

Either way, most of these points aren't aimed at the sort of person who checks with people over the internet to make sure that they don't offend anyone. The fact that you actually care about how you come across to people shows that you're conscientious enough to get along just fine. Just enjoy your visit, make a few new friends and have a great time!

It's plenty effective. Things like the God delusion helped me to understand my latent and at the time undefined atheism. It helped me to ""transition"" to being an ex-Muslim quite smoothly and without a lot of the hangups others have suffered. I didn't feel the slighted tinge of guilt.

Muslims in the UK in general are horribly ignorant on the basic nature of humanity, being atheist, being gay, trans, feminism etc etc etc are simply brushed under the carpet.

Muslims are always looking to play the victim and feel like everything is about demonising them. Can't be helped.
We can't wait for the glacial pace of progress (and sometimes regress) Islam is making in the UK.

What Muslims need is a ""We're Here! We're Queer! Get used to it!"" sort of shit for a whole range of social issues.

Here's the one I remember: a league campaign that never seriously threatened for a Champions League place, an uninspired Europa League that ended in the first round of the knockout stages, a fourth-round home FA Cup defeat, and a Carling Cup final defeat to Chelsea.

From the off, this cunt has an agenda to portray Spurs' season in a bad light. 

It doesn't mention why Atletico Madrid are less valuable. They are in the most debt of any club in Spain's professional leagues. That includes the second third and fourth tiers. Yes, it's true, and it's been well known for *fucking ages*. Hence their knack to snap up young players and sell them on for millions.

He speaks about:
&gt; Our priority is the trophy cabinet not the balance sheet; one based on sentiment rather than business

Well, did he see some of the beautiful displays of footballing ability we put on this season, as opposed to grinding out results? He acts like there's more money in placing as runners up in a cup final, and that Levy sent orders to stop them winning. There is a noticeable paradigm shift from ""get as many points as possible, and do whatever it takes"" to ""if you play good football, then the points will come"", which has been proved by many smaller clubs without the financial clout. 

There is a noticeable difference. Especially when you realise that we weren't actually that reliant of any one individual. Those of you might say that we were of Kane, but he merely provided the end result to wonderful service (with the exceptions of that goal versus Chelsea, ohhhh my) -- which is his job. It's just that he is *fucking good* at his job. People seem to forget how much Chadli stepped up this season, too, and only remember Kane and Eriksen. We really are a more unified band, with each person representing a component in what is shaping up to be a well-oiled machine. Just a little too well oiled at the moment, as there are a few leaks here and there.

&gt; While we take some stoical comfort in the passion and loyalty we show to the club when things are going badly, Levy just sees us as numbers to be taken for granted. He knows there are enough people, like me, who can be guaranteed to renew their season tickets come what may.

If numbers matter so much to Levy, then here's a number for you: 5. 5 year contract. When has he done that? That is a commitment we look like we are seeing through. 

This guy seems to be coming from a ""good ol' days"" point of view, yet there isn't the capacity in the stadium for everyone to watch the game. When every other team ends up with a 55/60k+ capacity stadium, and we're around with 36k, it makes it difficult to get it like the good ol' days, where people *could* go and watch the game. Instead, people, like this writer, keep renewing their tickets despite not fucking liking what they see.

If you don't like it, then moan from your armchair. Or your office chair, whilst you're writing about politics; which, by the way, maybe you should stick to.

Takeaways for Saints;

1. It's easy to forget we played without our first choice striker the whole season, who would have added on average a further 12 goals!. (Would that have put us into the CL?).

2. Pelle is extremely good value as our second choice striker with 11 goals, obviously he was really first choice without Rodriguez, which makes him an outstanding value.

3. Long yes we overpaid for him, but he is among the top three third choice strikers in the league.

4. Mayuka less said the better at this point.

5. Sadio Mane is the joker in the pack, do we list him as a striker or a midfield player? Who will be our fourth choice next year, hope it will be an U21 graduate who we can invest in for the future, Gallagher?

6. Next year should be fun if Rodriguez comes back to anything like his  old form and puts in the average # of goals for a first choice striker, and Pelle retains his form. 

7. From a transfer perspective Austin is well priced, Berahino is maybe priced a little high?

Here is my lineup next year if we get him.

----------------------------- Howard/Robles ---------------------------------

Coleman/? --- Jagielka/Browning -- Stones/Galloway --- Baines/Garbutt

------------------- Barkley/Barry ----- McCarthy/Besic --------------------

Lennon/Deuofeu ----------- Payet/Naismith ----------- Cleverley/Mirallas

--------------------------------- Lukaku/? -----------------------------------

I think Cleverley is going to be a great signing for us and will play Pienaar's old lefts-sided playmaker role if Mirallas leaves. Payet can slot into AM, this will push Ross further back into hopefully a CM. I assume we are going to get either Lennon or Deuofeu to play on the right and I honestly either one will be fine.

This looks like a massive upgrade on this years team and the only real change is an attacking midfielder who can produce assists. If Garbutt signs on then all we need is a second right back (Academy?) and a second striker (Long?).",null,0,null,1433979252,null,0,false,0,cs2eahb,null,t3_39cu6u,null,t1_cs2eahb,null,t3_39cu6u,null,null,null,1436892252,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

I (and I think everyone else) is on about parental leave for a newborn child! As in maternity/paternity leave. 

That's now 12 months total to share, but it only starts when the mother decides to stop her own maternity leave (which is slightly more favourable in terms of pay than the shared one).

So of the woman takes a month maternity leave, the couple would then have 11 months to share between them how they like (either at the same time, or alternate).

Coincidently, I am from Ilford,  the place where they went to find conservative Islamic views. If they would've stopped any of the younger,  British born Muslims,  they would've received very different answers.  But of course that was not the story being told here. 

To the outside observer,  that context is lost,  and it appears if this is a widespread view held by Muslims in the UK. But from my own experiences, the problems surrounding apostasy are just as much to do with culture (ie family honour in south Asian communities) as they are to do with religion. This was another important point missing in the piece. It is important to make these distinctions as the casual observer can easily miss details like this. 

In my view conservatism in British Islam is very much decreasing,  and it is only a matter of time before more secular ideals proliferate through a younger generation. All your hysteria does nothing to help the situation. In fact,  it only further entrenches divides. 

Unfortunately all real progress takes time,  and the only substitute for that is tyranny. Do you suggest we use force to make conservative Muslims adopt a more secular worldview? Should we ban Islam?

Not in my opinion. The keepers you listed are a class below Thibaut and the chances of us being able to actually get the player in to improve our right wing so significantly are very low. A keeper like Courtois wins us 10 points a season MINIMUM. Not just from his brilliant shot stopping but also from the sheer number of opportunities he prevents from materialising by grabbing pretty much anything that's put into the box. He is unmatched by anyone other than Neuer who is a good 5-6 years older. I'd have Courtois over Pogba every single day of the week.
Also you mentioned not so many Pogbas, but what exactly is it that makes him so unique? Oscar's been a regular starter for us this season in a title winning team.

However, international duty becomes a problem. Teams can miss their best players for months during euro/World Cup years, or just your regular stretch of friendlies in general. Players will miss a lot of time for various reasons. It will hurt the prestige of the league; most people tend to mock or laugh at summer leagues as if they ""not serious"" because they play those months. Also it causes conflict with international club competitions. Games can come at random times or when your team hasn't played a game in a while or hasn't gelled yet and lacks squad chemistry.

I found this bit interesting.

""By the way, any criminal that really wants to can convince your phone to connect to a false tower for a pittance"".


What exactly are the capabilities of these boxes and how far can they convince your phone of what? Because, I mean, I don't really care if people are pulling IMSI/ESN data off of my phone, but if any internet data etc. can be pulled down the wire then you're looking at mass bank fraud if one of these runs for any length of time in central London. I'm presuming, given that I haven't heard of any mass bank fraud or any such thing, that there are several stages between me and the tower that protect me from such things. However,  what does it take to get that proctection to work? 

What I find bizarre is that if it *is* only IMSI/ESN data, then how does pulling data from *one* tower allow you to ""find the exact location"" of a person? Is it supposed to be pulling GPS data? Does my phone broadcast a non-encrypted signal  containing it's precise location across an insecure band that can be hijacked by a fake tower? That seems unlikely (would an engineer do hat?) so is the article misleading (and you need multiple towers to triangulate), or is there something else in my phone that tells it where it is and lets these towers pull the information?

This article hasn't really told me anything useful other than ""hey, the police might be able to do what every telecom company in the country can do without telling you"" and that isn't really surprising. Heck, I'm not even sure that it's worrying. Identifying me and telling people where we are? My bank can probably tell you where I am and what I'm doing as well. As can the people that run Nectar cards. And anyone that runs a CCTV network in London. And Transport for London can give you a pretty good idea of my location at all times as well, and if they can't, National Rail probably can.

&gt; Kirk, Herbert Victor (b. 5 June 1912)
&gt; Politician; Unionist MP (Stormont); Northern Ireland Executive Minister January-May 1974
&gt; 
&gt; A graduate of Queen's University Herbert Kirk became a chartered accountant before entering politics when he was returned to the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1956 as the Unionist MP for the constituency of Windsor (1956-72). At Stormont he soon established himself and by 1962 had entered the cabinet as Minister of Labour and National Insurance (1962-64). This was subsequently followed by spells as Minister of Education (1964-65) and as Minister of Finance (1965-72). After the suspension of Stormont and the introduction of direct rule in March 1972, he supported the policies of Brian Faulkner, then leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). Kirk was to prove a close ally of Faulkner in the political discussions that were to lead to the subsequent moves to establish the power-sharing Executive and the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement. Elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in June 1973 for the constituency of South Belfast, he was appointed to the Executive as Head of the Department of Finance (January-May 1974). After its collapse in May 1974 Kirk decided to sever his ties with politics and returned to pursue his business interests.",null,0,null,1433983683,null,0,false,0,cs2gw6x,null,t3_39ciod,null,t1_cs2gw6x,null,t3_39ciod,null,null,null,1436894183,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

I checked their ""about us"" page and it's changed in the last few days. It used to mention a HQ in Nairobi (or another large city in Africa) but doesn't anymore. It also seems to have [mentioned](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kGVPouUws0IJ:www.sky105.com/p/about-us.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk) company number 6784543 which is a now dissolved clothing company that was based in London.
Their terms and conditions page decides to switch font for the words ""Sky 105"" halfway down the page.

There are no names associated with articles, nor with any other part of the site. They have no other useful online presence, apart from being submitted to reddit on a few occasions.

It seems very sketchy.

So I've done some more research. I picked a couple of random articles, and googled to see where they actually came from.

1) This article OP has linked is actually a word-for-word copy of [this Sky News article](http://news.sky.com/story/1499287/tobacco-firms-should-pay-to-help-smokers-stop)

1) [Silicon Valley just sent Obama a strongly worded warning](http://www.sky105.com/2015/06/silicon-valley-just-sent-obama-strongly.html) is actually just a stolen [Reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/cybersecurity-usa-encryption-idUSL1N0YU2F620150609).

2) [This article about an Australian man with a rare blood type](http://www.sky105.com/2015/06/a-man-from-australia-has-saved-more.html) seems to be a mix of articles. Some of [this huffpost article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/james-harrison-blood-donor_n_7546026.html) is copied verbatim as well as some of [this CNN article](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/09/health/james-harrison-golden-arm-blood-rhesus/index.html).

null,false,ZachsMind,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"Both actors are busy so this is probably impossible, but if I were pitching a series that featured these two characters, the inciting incident for the first episode would be something that intrigues them both: something in the universe that isn't supposed to exist and yet does. Something that most people ignore but both Jack &amp; Jenny are uniquely attuned to these things, because they themselves are paradoxes, both cuz of events in their past and due to events that have yet to happen to them. What would that be? I dunno yet. Whatever it is, it's been tailor made to attract only these two people and bring them together in a certain time and place in the universe. It would then be established that someone or something beyond them is playing them, manipulating them, and probably leading them into a trap. Following the clues should probably get them killed, if it weren't for the fact that cuz they're temporal paradoxes, they can't die. However, things can happen to them that would make them wish they were dead. It's a curiosity killed the cat kinda thing. How far down the rabbit hole would these two be willing to go? The answer is all the way, but with a lot of soul searching and daring each other to take each plunge and all kinds of other shenanigans. No these two do not end up together. Well heck I could have them have sex in the first season that's not the point. It wouldn't be a will they won't they kind of thing. Their relationship starts antagonistic and there may or may not be romantic sparks but becomes more like war veterans who have shared experiences no one else would ever understand, and Jack isn't the one who gets Jenny pregnant. It's someone else.. or maybe something else. It's space. There's aliens. She's a clone. He's trisexual. Heck she's probably trisexual. Anything can happen and probably would. 

Ever seen Midnight Run? Running Scared? Planes Trains and Automobiles? 48 Hours? Die Hard With A Vengeance? Into The Night? DOA? Hanky Panky (only without the hanky panky)? 

I could do this without ever involving The Doctor at all. He'd just be mentioned superfluously. Jack and Jenny may suspect his involvement somehow but that'd always be a red herring. I also wouldn't need to tell the story on Earth. In fact ideally this tale would take Jack and Jenny all over this galaxy and perhaps a few others. Into the distant past and even multiple distant futures. I could even confirm that in Jenny's distant future, she is destined to be the prime matriarch of a very large extended family of powerful temporal travelers. I could also confirm that in Jack's distant future he's destined to become The Face of Boe. The story would make it very clear these two will never die until after their fates were achieved and that's not for a long time to come. They are chained to their fates, but it's a very long chain. What happens between now and then however is anyone's guess. 

In their immediate future, they'd be running after something, only occasionally aware something is also after them, and multiple factions would always seem to be just a few steps ahead. I know what some of these factions are, but those discoveries would be saved for the next to last season, or never revealed at all. The possibilities are perhaps literally endless.
