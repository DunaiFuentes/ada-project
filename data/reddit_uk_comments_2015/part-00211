A bailiff would only visit if they had actually taken you to court, you lost, didn't pay and then ebay instructed bailiffs to collect the money.

One thing to remember: a debt collection agency has no special powers, they are just a company that sends letters and makes phone calls to try and get people to pay.

&gt; I've had threats by 11 different legal firms to take me to court to recover the debt also.

And yet no one has yet, after 5 years for a 5 figure sum. That to me is a big indicator they know they are trying it on.

Remember that after 6 years a debt becomes statute barred - they can no longer pursue it through the courts - VERY important though - if you make a payment in respect of the debt or acknowledge the debt then that clock is reset. [Info here](http://moneyaware.co.uk/2013/10/statute-barred-debt)

There is advice here that says lawyer up, I wouldn't do that *just* yet, not at least until you get a Letter Before Action or court papers drop through your letterbox. Solictors cost money and you can fight this yourself with some help.

Bentaleb was a key player, but Harry fucking carried us.  I shudder to think where we would have been without him.

There's also a simpler way to look at it: Bentaleb wasn't one of the 3 best players in the league at his position.  Kane ... was.  (Hell, to be fair, teams typically play with more CMs than strikers, but Nabil wasn't one the 5 or 6 best CMs either.)

Oh, and then there was that funny time that Harry Kane won two consecutive Player of the Month awards, which only Bergkamp, Fowler, and Ronaldo have ever done.  (Not to mention Young Player of the Year, though that's a little unfair since that's very much an attacking player's award, so not a good point of comparison with Nabil.)

Right, and then there's that bit about Kane having the best goal-scoring season of any Spurs player since Gary Lineker.

Sorry, but between Kane's season and Bentaleb's, it's not even close.  And that is no slight on Bentaleb, at all.

Just to play devil's advocate, if the operator is capable of putting the ride into an unsafe state, that's still a design flaw IMO. No one should be able to ""override"" a safety system that can cause an accident like this. 

Since we're making assumptions, it was probably either an automation design flaw, a design flaw that allowed the operator to put the ride into an unsafe state, or a design flaw that caused a sensor to fail to report where the trains were in relation to each other.

Seriously, Sharia Law only exists in Britain if it does not conflict with British common law. It was introduced to accommodate the Muslim community, many of its members wanted to be tried under Sharia Law for any religious cases.

There are a few problems with this:

* Sharia Law favours men. Muslim women are incredibly disadvantaged under Sharia Law, and there are charities set up to protect Muslim women from oppression, should they disagree with Sharia Law.
* Just because someone says that they are Muslim does not mean they wish to be tried under Sharia Law. They might see themselves as British first and foremost, which means if the other party in question wants to be tried under Sharia, then there's a problem (usually that means British law takes precedence).
* Misuse. Some non-Muslim people were using Sharia Law because it granted them better deals.

Basically, the simple premise was if something in Sharia law does not interfere with British law, then it can be used. If Sharia law *does* interfere with British law, then British law will always take precedence, e.g. there is no capital punishment in the UK, therefore, you cannot use Sharia law to administer capital punishment for any crime.

I applied for universities that I wasn't entirely sold on for lack of a better option (UCL and KCL), didn't get in by a sliver and rushed into clearing. But I left Leicester at the end of the second year after a bout of depression and having completely mucked up my dissertation, and got a job at a computer retailer.

I know it's not at my current employer, however. Too many rotating managers, some of which are awesome and others who are walking disasters. Low pay, boring shifts with no customers and incompetence at every level of the organisation.

In the Irish famine, the government and the Queen actively blocked aid from Turkey and presumably other countries. [Wiki]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland–Turkey_relations )

And as for the Bengal famine of 1943 (similarly to previous famines in India) grain continued to be exported from the area and some say that exports increased. The British army also took a scorched earth policy on the Indian Myanmar border fearing a Japanese invasion, yet did not supply the people with rations.

As a foreigner you shouldn't stick out too much and people are used to all sorts there. In Bristol or Manchester however, it's more likely people will take note of your accent. Not saying that there'll be any trouble at all. Just people may draw attention to that. 

As it's a study abroad program you'll most likely be put into university accommodation, hall of residence we call them. Given that all of your university choices are 'city' university rather than 'campus' the halls will be spread throughout the city as will the academic buildings. You'll also get your own room, we don't do roommates or 'dorms' here. Don't worry about that, it's fairly normal and you'll be able to find your way around just fine. 

The others have said, London is expensive but it's an amazing city. With only 3 months you'll be pushed to travel and explore that much of the UK. You won't be the only foreigner or American for that matter, but be sure to befriend some natives. 

Unsure whether you'll have to do exams for the term/semester (some university use 3 terms while other use 2 semesters to split the year) but rule of thumb for universities is the lectures and seminars don't contain 100% of the knowledge to achieve the top grades. One has to do extra work to get those top grades. 

As for mannerisms... in London, people don't like talking on public transport. Don't try and start conversations with strangers, with friends obviously it's fine. But when I lived in the States it was far more likely that random strangers would start a conversation. Stand on the right hand side of escalators when you're taking the underground. 

If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to pm me. I lived in London and have also been abroad for study in both Europe and the States so I know what it's like to be a foreigner in a strange country.

I think the main thing is they don't want every discussion on here to be about new players taking up 30 new threads a day.

When frankly anyone with a succinct enough opinion and a solid one can make it count in a megathread and can still have a proper discussion. It just seems as though people aren't willing to use them properly than actually that Megathreads are a bad idea.

It's like people actually expect the top post to be a discussion rather than a joke, that's never the case, this is bloody reddit. Jokes are quick and short, read quickly and upvoted quickly. Most actual discussions I'm ever involved in on reddit, particularly these kind of smaller subs never involve upvotes.

And then factor in the fact that shit loads of the people that use the subreddit don't actually always use the comments or in fact come here for the discussion. They come here to read articles.

And frankly the megathreads are far better organised and a give all the sources properly in brackets now and links. Which is pretty decent for anyone with a brain to quickly asses their validity without discussing it with 100 equally unknowledgable fuckwits wondering how they should while away their time now they've no longer got a beautiful game to watch.

And I'm sorry that turned into a rant. But the idea that people just posting shit ad infinitum is better than a toned down reasonable thread with rumours and potentially 1-on-1 discussion is stupid. The number of times discussions are simply repeated between threads is ridiculous. The number of times I've had to come up with why I dislike Mikel. The number of times I need to come up with why Griezmann would be a ridiculous buy. I really don't need to put my thoughts down 15 times in 15 different threads to discuss with people who will just ignore the arguments and not move on.

Ideally the people using the megathreads would be posting jokes and having actually reason discussions. But that so rarely happens on here.

Bentaleb has had a promising start and I think he has the potential to be world class, but let's be clear: he's not world class right now. He's not one of the best players in the league. He's young, and he's improving because of investment from the club.

It's a shitty attitude that he should be paid the same as people who have played for a decade more on the back of a single decent season. And I don't get the ""pay the man"" posts we have here. Do you guys understand how the club even works?

If you ""just pay the man"" now, what happens when we've no higher to go and he's 25? What happens when we have another academy breakout at 19 and they want £50,000 a week because they were better than Bentaleb? We can't do any of that shit because we *have* to do better than our means.

A wage structure is non negotiable, and it's the only thing that holds this club apart from Leeds and Aston Villa, who have both been in our position. Leeds were in the CL ffs. You don't fuck your wage structure if you want to stay competitive with a lower budget than everyone else. Having said that, you don't want to lose players that if you had to buy/replace them would cost you £20m+ and you certainly don't want to do that on the cheap.

There is no easy answer. It's made a lot easier if Bentaleb recognises that as well as his service to the club, the club has served him (he was released from everywhere before we picked him up and he's clearly come a long way).

I would rather that Bentaleb/'s agent relented than Levy, even though I think he's one of the top prospects in Europe. Tens of thousands of pounds per week is crazy money for someone so young, I can't really connect with the idea that £40,000/week is going to meaningfully impact his life vs £20,000. We're talking more than a million pounds a year for like a 19 year old boy. How do you reconcile that money at that age? What does that do to you?

The behaviour described as failing to properly classify complaints; encouraging complainants to go away rather than register a complaint; and closing cases without thorough investigation of allegations is not restricted to police forces who feel overburdened with work.  In my experience, these unethical and unprofessional practices are carried out at other levels of government where their managers pressure staff to achieve unachievable targets/goals without providing them with the requisite tools or means to do so.  Short of whipping a dead horse, managers encourage and then turn a blind eye to these abuses in order to please their own hypocritical masters. Statistics start to lack any meaning but are trotted out as being performance measures.  Unfortunately, statistics often lie.  Overwork burns out dedicated staff.  And the management push for paper stats encourages the less dedicated  and/or new workers to begin to think these practices are the new norm.  They end up to be the norm. Those who speak up against these practices wind up discredited, moved out or ostracized.  It is a career limiting move to speak truth to power and work in the public interest.

It is pathetic that our leaders do not properly fund the hiring and training of sufficient staff to deal with crime, particularly crimes against women and children.  And, in turn, to fund the psychological rehabilitation needs of the victims.  And to develop and deliver educational platforms to educate everyone on the rights of women and children and their legal recourse in the event they are violated.  Laws need to change to treat sexual violence as serious crimes entailing long prison sentences.

As for Cali culture vs London, depends on So Cal or Northern. I lived in San Francisco and there are parts where the two cities are very similar. Both have 'hipster' zones. Police are a LOT nicer here on the UK. They'll help you out with nearly anything. 

As for weather. I don't know what time of year you'll be in London, but that is one stereotype that is true. It rains... Loads. But there are some sunny days in summer where everyone and their mums will take their tops off (it's disgusting). 

Also before I forget, another slight difference is tipping. In the UK waiters do receive a proper wage and therefore a tip of 10% is maximum. Unless it's unbelievably good service which you deem worthy of special recognition. You don't tip at bars for drinks.

Also we keep our washing machines in the kitchen not in the bathroom. I've found this confuses many Americans. We also do drink tea like there's no tomorrow. 

A standard greeting is 'hey, you alright?' this is not implying that there is anything wrong with you, it's similar to 'hey, what's up?' 

As the other comment said, we insult each other a lot, but I'd be weary of trying to join in as it takes a when a gauge what is acceptable. Also it would be poor taste to make fun of the UK whilst there. Natives can do it, but you can't, much like you can complain about your family but not others. 

As a student you'll be doing a lot of drinking (drinking age is 18) so be prepared for pubs, bars, and clubs often. For students during the week is more popular than weekends as it's cheaper and often 'student nights'.

The tacit assumption in these cases that the male party had the power and therefore must have consented is a huge issue and it's an issue that comes from the automatic way power is assumed to be a male thing by and large.

If you want to try learning to code, start with Python on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/).

If you want to try something else, have a look at what's available on [edX](http://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org), [FutureLearn](http://www.futurelearn.com) or [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). There's also a lot of good material on YouTube - Crash Course World History, for example. If you want to learn a language, you can get started easily with [Duolingo](http://www.Duolingo.com) and learn vocabulary with [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/) and [Lingvist](http://www.lingvist.io/).

He's not supposed to be David Tennant nor is he supposed to be Matt Smith because then it wouldn't be right. None of the doctors exhibit the same personalities otherwise, what would be the point of regeneration?

Basically, those people wanting to jump ship because they don't like Peter Capaldi aren't true fans of the show. In addition, perhaps they don't fully understand the concept of regeneration. Heck, after David Tennant left and Matt Smith took over, there were plenty of naysayers; so this situation isn't exclusive to Peter Capaldi. Most people don't like change, and a lot of people cry when their favorite characters are replaced, which makes it even harder to accept the change. Combine that with the less than stellar script writing, and you have a unfair assessment of Peter Capaldi's portrayal of The Doctor. 

Personally, I've enjoyed what Capaldi has brought to the character. He's dark and mysterious, yet kind with a warm spot. He's complicated and dangerous, yet wise with a hint of vulnerability--all that makes him fun to watch. In addition he's still stubborn, which plays amazingly off of Clara's stubbornness.

null,false,Quagers,null,null,null,"&gt;It is written in a such a way as to give multinational companies a huge advantage on trade.  If a public hospital is built close to a private one, the private hospital has the right to sue the country for expected losses.

Calling it now, I bet it doesn't say that and that is their ""interpretation"" of what it allows, based on absolutely zero legal background.

Looking at the section linked its just the same old arguments about ISDS.

Edit: For instance for those who say ""TTIP will stop us nationalising things because companies will sue"", here is the actual text (yes this is TTP, but its unlikely to be that different, these provisions are pretty boilerplate.

&gt;**Article 11.7: Expropriation and Compensation**

&gt;1. No  Party  may  expropriate  or  nationalize  a  covered  investment  either  directly  or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (“expropriation”), except:

&gt;(a) for a public purpose;

&gt;(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;

&gt;(c) on  payment  of  prompt,  adequate,  and  effective  compensation  in  accordance with paragraphs 2 through 4; and

&gt;(d) in accordance with due process of law.

&gt; 2. Compensation shall:

&gt;(a) be paid without delay;

&gt;(b) be  equivalent  to  the  fair  market  value  of  the  expropriated  investment immediately before the expropriation took place (“the date of expropriation”);

&gt;(c) not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier; and 

&gt;(d) be fully realizable and freely transferable.

Which is exactly how any reasonable country (including ours) would do it anyway without this treaty! This is squarely aimed at the sort of countries who will turn up to the gates of your oil refinery with a truck full of soldiers and say ""this is ours now, fuck off"". The only powers governments forfeit is to act badly.

Edit 2 (as I read through): Also, safeguards for health and the environment.

&gt;Provided  that  such  measures  are  not  applied  in  an  arbitrary  or  unjustifiable manner,  or  do  not  constitute  a  disguised  restriction  on  international  trade  or investment, paragraphs 1(b), (c), and (f), and 2(a) and (b), shall not be construed to  prevent  a  Party  from  adopting  or  maintaining  measures,  including environmental measures:  

&gt;(i)   necessary  to  secure  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  that  are  not inconsistent with this Agreement;  

&gt;(ii)   necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health; or   

&gt;(iii)   related  to  the  conservation  of  living  or  non-living  exhaustible  natural resources

and,

&gt; **Article II.15: Investment and Environmental, Health and other Regulatory Objectives** 

&gt; Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure  that  investment  activity  in  its  territory  is  undertaken  in  a  manner  sensitive  to environmental, health, or other regulatory objectives.

Plus looks like Australia has a specific exemption for their healthcare systems, as is planned for the NHS under TTIP,

&gt;**Annex on Health** 

&gt;The  following  measures of  Australia  shall  not  be  subject  to  the dispute  settlement  procedures under  Section  B  (Investor-State  Dispute  Settlement)  of  the  Investment  Chapter:  measures comprising  or  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme,  Medicare  Benefits  Scheme, Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator

I wonder if redstatements even read the text of the thing they were linking to before they came up with their sensationalist little hospital story, I certainly can't see anything in there which would obviously lead them to the conclusion they came to.

Edit 3: Ohh look the courts **aren't even going to be secret** (my emphasis below).

&gt;**Article II.23: Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings**  

&gt;1.    Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Parties and make them available to the public:  

&gt;(a)  the notice of intent;  

&gt;(b)  the notice of arbitration;    

&gt;(c)  pleadings,  memorials,  and  briefs  submitted  to  the  tribunal  by  a  disputing party  and  any  written  submissions  submitted  pursuant  to  Article  II.22(2)  and II.22(3) and Article II.27;  

&gt;(c)  minutes or transcripts of hearings of the tribunal, where available; and  

&gt;(d)  orders, awards, and decisions of the tribunal.  

&gt; 2 **The  tribunal  shall  conduct  hearings  open  to  the  public**  and  shall  determine,  in consultation with the disputing  parties,  the appropriate  logistical  arrangements. However, any  disputing  party  that  intends  to  use  information  that  is  designated  as  protected information or otherwise subject to paragraph 3 in a hearing shall so advise the tribunal.

So may I ask what would you recommend doing? Still going to that uni, or maybe taking up some courses in UK that'll help me get into a better one (not really sure how this works in the UK though)? Or is it possible to transfer?

No shit, really?  Here I was thinking that causality was bunkum.

You're arguing from hindsight here, ""oh, it was avoidable"".  But that's not a useful thing to say.  Rollercoasters are intrinsically hazardous systems, and while you can add as many safety features as you like in, you cannot design out the inherent danger in strapping humans into large metal structures and sending them zooming around at high speeds.  While you can add in failure modes and other system elements, you cannot guard against all possible combinations of failure modes, because there's basically an infinte combination of these things which are possible.

This is why post-hoc attribution to a root cause is completely unhelpful.  It's almost always a combination of small failures, each in itself insufficient to cause an accident but in combination they are enough to cause one.  However hindsight bias always gets in the way, and leads to blame being assigned, because people ""should have known"".

Story time, pull up a sandbag. Back when I was in uni in central London I saw one of these chuggers and having nothing to do I thought I'd listen to his story. I was told of the kids in Africa that have no water, need mosquito nets etc and so I decided to sign up. It was only £5 a month, right?

2 months later I get a call from a credit company demanding to know why I haven't paid my bill, then I start getting letters from 5 other companies. The charity was a scam, purely getting people's details for identity theft. It took me months to clear my name.

Moral of the story kids, NEVER EVER give to chuggers. There is no guarantee these people are who they say they are. All a scammer needs to do is get some tabards printed saying 'action aid' or something and they appear real. Sometimes the chugger themselves may not know its a scam.

For that matter I rarely give to charity now. I hate when they put on the sob story on TV saying 'these people need money' without giving a shred of evidence that their previous donations have made a blind difference.

null,false,BaBaFiCo,null,null,null,"I'm going to look at it from a different point of view. What has already been expressed here is good in terms of the parents and pupils so I won't add to that but I'm going to selfishly look at it from the teachers' point of view (who many forget are employees not volunteers). 

An academy, as many have said, is free from the ties of the Local Educational Authority (LEA). As has been said, this allows schools to operate free from what could be their damaging influence or tailor things to suit their individual school. But what has not been said is how these academies are allowed to operate free from some of the important rules we have in place in state schools. 

1) Academies do not need hire teachers with a qualification in exactly that - teaching. In fact they are free to hire whomever they please! This can be a pro or a con. On the one hand, this allows them to bring in specialists, such as engineers, artists or scientists who may be experts in their field but don't have a teaching qualification. However, this also allows them to hire Joe Bloggs to be a body in the classroom, despite no experience in teaching who might utterly fail the hundreds of children he sees each week. As a teacher myself (unqualified!) I can tell you that it is a highly specialised profession. The reason I disagree with Teach First (the scheme that allows those with first class degrees to go straight into the classroom) is that subject knowledge =/= ability to teach the subject or even control a class. By allowing academies to bypass teacher training it can increase the likelihood of unfit teachers in the classroom. From a selfish point of view it also means that teachers can be sacked from or passed over for a role that is given to the cheaper, unqualified teacher.

2) Academies don't employee staff in the same way as state schools. This reason is often overlooked because teaching unions know that it is better PR to focus on the effects on the children than the effects on the teachers. But it boils down to the fact that teachers are employed either for a year or indefinitely by state schools, but baring extenuating circumstances, they are guaranteed their role from Sept 1st to Aug 31st each year. As well as these, teachers follow a set pay structure that means pay is equal across the country (except in and around London where living costs are taken into account). Academies are free to hire and fire as they please and can pay as they please as well. The pro of this is that they can get rid of underperforming staff much more easily and offer financial incentives for performance. However, this can also lead to a high turnover in staff, poor morale and a lack of continuity for students. Staff can be unsure of their job security and anecdotal evidence of experience is that academies will fire masses of staff members to cut costs with little warning. This led to rolling strikes at a local school.

I started on a 12k job out of uni, it was fucking awful. shit job, shit pay. but i got experience from it, moved on up.

11 years later, i'm earning around 4 times that , and i could be doing better than that if i'd actively pursued a higher wage at every opportunity. It has required me to move cities several times, but thats the cost of working an industry that's based largely in major cities. I don't do software engineering either - as a job I wasn't fond of it , so along the way I switched to more Sysadmin type stuff.

things I would/should have done better

* worked for a year or two before going to uni. I was an idiot at 18, and 2 years of life experience, plus wages and savings would have put me in a much better position
* work during uni part time - not for the income - but for the experience which makes
* ditto summer work, ideally in something IT related
* got a decent degree mark.]
* stayed in shit jobs too long because i didn't want to move cities

null,false,Pikul,lfc87,null,null,"&gt;If a transfer committee/DoF is in place, who gets the final say? I'm under the impression that it's usually the manager that gives the ""green light"" when pursuing a player.

Director of Football has the final say, on the so called transfer committee, Rodgers does.

&gt;I'm not asking for names but what is a transfer committee normally composed of? Analysts, coaches and scouts?

Manager, analyst, recruiter, and someone to look at the financials. I think there another role, but I can't remember.

&gt;What are the advantages and drawbacks of hiring a DoF? Pros and cons of a transfer committee?

A DOF is a sole person who calls all the shots regarding the players we need and if anything goes wrong the blame is on him, while the manager is left to just coach. I'm guessing here as none of us really know, but with a committee, members will shortlist players based on their own analysis (traditional scouting, statistical etc.) and through several meetings will shortlist a bunch of players that we will further scout before agreeing on a few that we will attempt to sign. How much we're willing to spend on a player is also analysed, this is where I believe Ayre is most involved. 

Even though Rodgers has final say, there's multiple people to blame if something goes wrong. I believe there's nothing wrong with having a 'committee' as we call it, every club has numerous people involved in transfers, scouting etc.. But there does appear to be something in our transfer process that isn't right, maybe some people are given more control than they should have, I don't know.

&gt;If a manager pursues a player without the blessing of the DoF/committee, would the manager face any repercussions besides possibly being sacked?

I don't believe that could possibly happen at any club as there's other people involved with transfers besides the manager, club executives etc. Rodgers appears to be given a certain freedom though, it's widely believed Lallana, Lovren &amp; Lambert are exclusively his signings.


Most of this is guesswork really, none of us really have any true insight to what goes on behind closed doors.

If none of that works I'll use IRC (Networks: IRChighway or Undernet, Channels: ebooks, ebookz or bookz ) which has a surprising amount of books I haven't found elsewhere.

If I'm desperate I'll move on to Usenet NZB indexers if that doesn't work then I download the entire index of Usenet ebook groups and search them, ending with public trackers and finally search engines.

In some situations I've even bought a paper copy of the book and OCR'd it, then put it in an appropriate format myself.

I've got a Paperwhite so I tend to search for MOBI or decrypted AZW or AZW3 files. Though a decent EPUB or even HTML file converts fine in Calibre with the occasional bit of editing required.

I tend to go for decrypted retail or quality 4 or 5 releases. Some of which are actually better than the retail releases as they've been proofread and not just OCR'd.

Not that it matters but like I say I only ever do this when I can't legally buy the book in a decent format or quality.

It had some giraffes, some ostriches, some crocodiles... anyway, there was this American tour group going through the exhibits with a tour guide. We'd opted out of the tour because we were mostly zoology/ecology students on a field course, so we were just wandering around looking at the various different things.

At one exhibit one of the American guys was talking very loudly to the tour guide. He was saying ""make them do something, they're all sleeping"". (They weren't sleeping: they were extremely ill because of the poor conditions.) So the tour guide picks up a stick and starts hitting the crocodile with it. Predictably it rouses itself from its stupor to make some nice.

The man asks if he can try, then starts trying to poke the crocodile in the eye, all the while loudly exclaiming how the alligators back home are far more ferocious.

In another part of Kenya we were touring a local school. We'd bought a large stock of pencils, books, rubbers etc to give to the children of the school because it cost us like £20 each and bought a shit ton of supplies. Anyway, there was this other group of people visiting the school as well. When we were speaking to the youngest class of children I heard one of the women in the other group say (loudly, of course) 'these people smell so bad, they're so poor.' She was American. Didn't seem to be able to moderate the sound of her voice **at all** because later on in one of the only bars in town she kept attracting glances from locals all night because of how loud she was. Constantly. With almost nothing interesting to say.

Those are examples of bad people, with which I don't mean to imply OP is a douche. I have an American friend who consistently speaks far too loudly for the setting - she's lovely, but when we are out together I do cringe sometimes because of the noise level.

(I should add - I am not anti-American nor do I think all Americans are like this. But in my experience Americans **are** louder than your average Britain person and that can take getting used to from both the British and the American.

Tip - putting the chain loosely around the rear wheel will not stop thieves nicking it. They YZFs are beautiful bikes - they're the prime target for a lot of ""lift into back of van"" type crimes. Looping a chain around the rear wheel will not stop two blokes whisking her away. 125s are very light, compared to bigger bikes where the weight alone might be a deterrent.

Get something like an [Oxford Ground Anchor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/30/dp/B007N2X38E) and install it properly. Loop the chain around that and the frame of the bike. It will make it much, *much* less desirable to steal, as it will no longer be a quick and easy job. Even if you can't loop it around the frame, loop it around the wheel instead. The thieves will have to bring a disc saw and a set of wheel-removal tools at the bare minimum to remove the chain, but at the same time risk damaging the frame of the bike, so they will likely not bother. Whereas with just a chain around a wheel, they can lift it up.

I wouldn't mind that if only:

* There were more jobs for people above 50
* We understood that one doesn't have the same set of skills/interests at 25, 45 and 65. Meaning we must allow people to evolve gracefully during their life and there should be state-wide long term strategies to guide and support people's evolution. At least in France, our training story is just worthless.

Basically, if you simply push the retirement age without telling people a better story regarding their work evolution, you won't get support from them.

I believe, lots of elderly people are happy to continue being part of their community, they just don't want the same job they had at 30.

It's not, men are rarely shamed for sleeping around and women often are, whereas women are rarely shamed for having little sex and men often are.

I: Did you manage to say goodbye to Steven Gerrard
MS: Yeah, he was a player of our team for a long time and now he is leaving. The farewell party was quite good.

I: You should have an offer on table for a new contract but you still did not sign it. Is that right?
MS: No I did not sign a new contract

I: Rumours are that LFC will pay you the full wage only if you play in certain, high amount of matches, is that true?
MS: Yes, that is not acceptable for me

I: So this is the obstacle that kept you from signing a new contract?
MS: Cerainly. This is the kind of a contract that is usually offered to players who are much older than me or are injury prone. I dont feel that I am that old and I dont have any injury problems. The contract they offered me is unacceptable and that is why I did not sign it. Currently I still have one year left on my current contract. There are some rumours about the interest from other clubs but I dont concern myself by that. Now is the time for national squad, vacation and what happens after depends on my will.

I: 6th place in BPL is surprising (in a negative way- this word is hard to translate to english) Whats your opinion on this season
MS: The season was not succesful because we did not achieve the goals we set in the beginning. There is almost no difference between finishing 5th or 6th, we would not qualify for CL anyway. The main cause of the failure was that we lost Luis Suarez, that kind of player would be missed by any club. There were a lot of new faces in the club before the season started and it takes time for them to adapt. Thats why the first part of the season was as bad as it was. The second part was better but we fell off in the end.

I: BR offered his position as a LFC manager but after the discussions with the owners it seems that he will stay. Are you personally happy with this decision?
MS: Whether coach stays or leaves, that is up to the owners, players do not influence this decision very much. I think that BR proved himself as a manager, the owners backed him, so I can say for myself that I am happy.

That doesn’t mean somebody else is picking the team for Brendan [Rodgers, the manager]. But Brendan needs to set out with his team of people which positions we want to fill and what the key targets would be for that.

&gt;“He has a team of people that go out and do an inordinate amount of analysis work to establish who are the best players in that position. It’s a combination of things. Despite what people think and read, it’s not a whole bunch of guys sitting behind a computer working out who we should buy. It’s a combination of old-school scouting and watching players — and that’s Brendan, his assistants, our scouts — with statistical analysis of players across Europe and the rest of the world. By bringing those two processes together, you get a much more educated view of who you should and shouldn’t be buying. And perhaps as fundamentally, how much you should be paying and the structure to those contracts.”

So, he wants to further limit free speech.  It's the idea that you can stop bad ideas just by banning them.  But there's no evidence that this ever works.  The only effective way to kill (or at least limit) a bad idea is to defeat it with better ideas.

Having said that, when I was a teenager, I couldn't wait to leave the place. I found it very dull so moved to London at the earliest oppurtunity. But I have friends who grew up there and have never left so I think it might be just me. And now I have my first child on the way, I have even considered going back.

We're apparently paying Milner like a starting player, but as long as Hendo is here, Milner shouldn't be in our starting 11. Milner and Hendo together are no where near strong enough defensively to cut it, meaning that they'll probably need to be flanked by a DM like Lucas. Thats certainly a strong defensive stance, especially if we're gonna keep the 3 central defenders, but my oh my thats not a lot of creativity and attacking ability. 

They could also play them with Coutinho, which would give us far better offensive abilities, but i'm sure attacks lead by Aguero, Silva, Toure or Hazard, Costa, Fabregas are shaking in their boots by the prospect of a mighty Liverpool defence in that case. 

Meaning if Hendo and Milner plays together, we'll probably have to play both a DM and Coutinho, leaving us with Coutinho and 2 other attacking players who are somewhat special offensively(Oh boy I can't wait for Ings to start 25 games in place of an injured Sturridge), to go with decent offensively Hendo and Milner. Will that get us top 4? Maybe, depends on the players flanking Coutinho, and lets just say Ings isn't gonna cut it. Will it get us closer to winning the league?

Do you ever go off the internet and talk to people? They'll generally express concern if their daughter is sleeping with a different man every week, usually more so than if it was their son. It takes some basic social awareness to know that our society views male and female sexuality in different ways.

No, I'm not, I'm suggesting that their gender does not define how they will react, therefore to disregard male victims of statutory rape  purely because they're male is sexist.

&gt; You've completely lost me here.

I'm saying that the law should be applied to people equally regardless of their sex, I don't see what's so hard to follow about that.

Think about my argument this way, men are generally encouraged to be more competitive and outgoing than women, men who are like this would this would suit a competitive job or career well, but that doesn't mean men should instantly be regarded as better candidates for this position than their female counterparts.

Gender roles hurt those who don't fit them (and arguably hurt those who do occasionally), saying this case isn't important because boys are more likely to want sex ignores the possibility that this child was traumatised by this experience.

null,false,Subotan,,wow so blairite such kendall many votes,null,"Mate, you honestly have no idea about the deeper context of the Muslim far-right in the Middle East if you think everything was hunky dory before 2003.

Where the West screws up is swooping in and blowing stuff up, then fucking off a few years later and providing no support for those forces in the Middle East which do value and protect human rights. The fucking off is the problem here, because it means the gains we do make in restoring stability and building a regime which is committed to human rights (which is the only long term solution to Middle East political instability) collapses (See Iraq, Libya).

Iraqis turned out en masse three times to vote in general elections after 2003. For years after the War in Syria began next door, Iraq was at peace. This is because Iraqis, even Sunnis who supported Saddam and who now support ISIS, initially had faith that the system we'd built with them would survive and protect them, even as Maliki turned Iraq into a sectarian Shia satellite state of Iran. Likewise Libya - helping in Libya's own destruction of Gaddafi then ignoring Libya's incredible needs has led to a second war. Tunisia is also receiving the bare minimum of support, whilst Sisi's grotesque Egypt receives billions in military aid.

The invasion of Iraq will probably be seen by historians as a huge blunder - but the fact that we let Maliki erase the things we did achieve from after 2006 will be seen as an era-defining catastrophe. The West needs to be involved in the Middle East to help our allies fend off butchers, and that includes using military force when the situation requires. Don't act as if your isolationism, which has killed hundreds of thousands in Syria and now Iraq, is the position which stands for human rights and peace in the Middle East.

""The UK's job market tightened further in April, with the number of vacancies climbing and the number of jobseekers falling. There were 1,033,435 job vacancies in April, according to figures released today by job search site Adzuna.co.uk. It marks a post-recession high and is 25.6 per cent more than in the same month last year. Meanwhile, the number of jobseekers dropped to a post-recession low of 795,967, a 30 per cent decline on the year. The developments take competition for places to a record low of 0.77 jobseekers per advertised vacancy, down from 1.39 in April last year. The ratio of jobseekers to vacancies fell in 32 of the top 50 cities. Adzuna.co.uk co-founder Andrew Hunter believes businesses could be facing a shortage of skills.

The probability question I found hard when I first looked at it, but then I came back to it after and realised it's actually pretty simple.

This is how I did it:

1. 6/n * 5/(n - 1) = 1/3

2. Multiply these two fractions, and you get: 30/(n^2 - n) = 1/3

3. Multiply both sides by (n^2 - n) and you get: 30 = (1/3)n^2 - (1/3)n

4. Minus 30 from both sides (to get = 0, which leads to: (1/3)n^2 - (1/3)n - 30 = 0

5. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the 1/3s and you get: n^2 - n - 90 = 0


I did Stage 1 like that because it said there were 6 sweets, and the probability of picking two is 1/3, therefore the second time he/she picks the sweet, it must be 5 (already taken one out) out of (n - 1) because the total has been reduced by 1.

&gt;They'll generally express concern if their daughter is sleeping with a different man every week, usually more so than if it was their son.

I'd suggest they'd express concern for both.

&gt;It takes some basic social awareness to know that our society views male and female sexuality in different ways.

Yes, they do - but not in the way you're describing which sounds like something from the 70's.

&gt;No, I'm not, I'm suggesting that their gender does not define how they will react

Define, no. Affect, certainly.

&gt; therefore to disregard male victims of statutory rape purely because they're male is sexist.

Who was disregarding anything? Half my replies seem to be addressing your agenda instead of the point I was making.

&gt;I'm saying that the law should be applied to people equally regardless of their sex

I've been pointing out that it's daft to apply the law as if gender is irrelevant when it's so demonstrably not. There's a difference between equal and identical.

&gt;but that doesn't mean men should instantly be regarded as better candidates for this position than their female counterparts.

Indeed it doesn't, but neither does that translate into refusing to acknowledge their better suitability either (in the name of equality).

&gt;saying this case isn't important because boys are more likely to want sex ignores the possibility that this child was traumatised by this experience.

Good job I didn't saying that, eh? See what I mean about 'agenda'?

Peter Robinson, the DUP, and the wider Unionist/Loyalist side of the community are in complete denial however that Unionist/Loyalist crimes exist and as such, victims of their considerable amount of crimes are often left out in the cold. 

They have proposed bills in the past to specifically stop those even **suspected** of IRA involvement being classed as victims if they were killed in shoot-to-kill incidents or other incidents like Bloody Sunday or whatever. 

That would mean introducing a guilty-until-proven-innocent mechanism into law here, quite a first for any 'democracy' in the world.

null,false,NeoNerd,null,null,null,"My undergrad was a LL.B. in Scotland, so four years rather than three.

My second year was the undergrad peak of taught time, classes and exams. I think I had 13 exams over the course of the second year. Third and fourth years had a huge drop-off in taught time - I had 4 hours of taught time a week in my fourth year. At the same time, the material became a lot less practical and a great deal more academic. Those factors, together with an (entirely welcome) expansion in my social circle and life led to a drop-off in grades after second year. Unfortunately, the degree classification depended entirely on the final two years, so I ended up with a high 2.2 rather than a 2.1.

I went back for a postgraduate year, which was a new peak in taught time, work and classes. It was also entirely, completely practical law rather than academic law. I loved this year (although plenty hated it) and did well. 

Career-wise, a 2.2 held me back for a couple of years. It prevented me applying for plenty of jobs and hurt applications otherwise. But I'm now in my targeted job after working my way up through my employer. I started off in a non-legal job, moved to a very junior quasi-legal job, then to a junior legal job and now to my 'dream job'.

It was (to my 18y/o self at least) a bit of a moral dilemma. Secondly, at what point should a supermarket cut their losses on produce? Is it acceptable to mark down a bunch of food to 10p to make sure that at least some cost is recouped? Our bonus was tied to our waste bill, which was astronomical due to utter fucking incompetence, but it encourages staff to make sure things sell instead of going to waste, which means decisions regarding when and how to reduce prices are often taken on the fly by people who are frankly not aware of the greater supply/demand problems of the shop, leading to further losses and problems with supply over the following days/weeks. Thirdly, if something doesn't sell, or if there were products found after closing that should have been marked down and sold, should staff members be able to purchase the product at reduced prices? It can lead to a culture of hiding produce, or not marking it down to a reasonable level so that staff can pick what they want at dirt cheap prices (yes it's fraud but find me someone working in a supermarket who gives a shit), which makes the whole situation an absolute rats nest for management.

He's quite good at running forward with pace and his passing is alright from what I can tell (picked up a few assists from RB) and from what we saw last season he has a good shot on him, also means his defensive duties can be lessened as he does struggle with defending in that RB role. However this is a risk and I think i'd rather we bring in a new player who can slot into the first team and use Bacuna and Gardner as rotation options. Bacuna is a little rough around the edges, but still very young. I reckon that we should take a punt on him in midfield (as well as bringing in another player, whether that is a new signing or Gardner), if not he's still a handy player to have, a good utility player.",null,0,null,1433415750,null,0,1433417992,0,crv6ka3,null,t3_38i1h1,null,t1_crv6ka3,null,t3_38i1h1,null,null,null,1436718865,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Don't get me wrong, the kid looks to have bags of talent, but having signed Milner we now have can, Hendo, Milner, Allen who all play the same midfield role as a box to box player.

Obviously a striker should be our first priority, and after that I really hope we're doing everything we can to make the nathaniel Clyne situation a reality, but after that what we need is a solid CDM. None of Can, Milner, Hendo, Allen or kovacic fit that role. Lucas is either or out or won't be able to play ever game.

Speech and action are very different things.  You can be for the freedom to express any idea whilst being against the freedom to harm others through your actions.

Of course you then get the argument that some types of speech really can harm other people.  And I agree with that - but I still don't think that you can just legislate bad ideas out of existence.  For one - it just doesn't work.  There's no evidence that e.g. banning holocaust denial has actually led to a reduction in the belief.  Moreover - there's a real danger that speech-codes can be mis-used for political purposes to silence critics.

I wanted to pay my credit card bill and sent the money online from Natwest, but it went to a completely different account and when the bank said my card hadn't been paid off, I got onto both the bank and Natwest. 

Natwest were ridiculously unhelpful and after phoning them 4 times I was finally put through to somone who knew how to help me. Since I didn't know where the money went, they did a call back of the money and said this could take up to a month to get back into my account. 

I have since found where the money went - to an inactive account I had as a teenager, with Nationwide. When I phoned Nationwide they were really great and a huge contrast to Natwest. 

My advice - see if Natwest can call back your payment as well. Try phoning through a few times (before 5pm UK time because although the callcentre people are still working, the offices of the people who can actually do stuff are shut). Eventually you might be able to get to someone who can actually help. 

As for complaining, I really don't know and I wish I could help. I, too, was very frustrated with Natwest and couldn't find where to complain. Perhaps Twitter?

How do you know the life story of every single person you know who has self harmed? Not being diagnosed doesn't mean that you're not ill. Being open about it doesn't mean that it's not real.

&gt;How many times in recent years have we been chasing a player and they've signed for a rival Premier League team over us?

No other team was desperate like we were, our offer's base salary was apparently higher than City's and Arsenal aren't going to pay £150k/week to a player to sit on their bench, he isn't better than any of their options and that would mean he's on more than Ozil and Sanchez....

This would be an amazing signing if we didn't have Hendo.

My job is very hit and miss, some weeks work 6 days, lately been working 1 if I'm lucky.

It's far easier at the dole office if you're either 0 hours a week or 16+

When I was with the ex we were back and forwards all the time, of course they fucked up housing benefits, the JSA rate (one month for example I earned £1400, was getting between us JSA at £55 p/w, I told 7 different people on the phone it's not right, was assured it was and come back next month), then last summer had 3 months where I earned on average £250 a month, was getting £14 a week housing benefit plus £11 a week JSA so was having to go to wonga to make up the shortfall (again told it was right)
Then in September time got all brown envelopes through the door saying had been overpaid £700 in 2012/13 and with fines would have to pay back £1400, yeah right I could do that on no income

Anyway, long ramble, but if I'd been working 0 hours we'd have known each month or week where we were and could have budgeted accordingly (would have got £112 JSA, £61 CTC, £20 CB and £30 maintenance off her ex, plus just have to pay out £14 a week bedroom tax plus £4 a week council tax), could have easily managed on that but I wasn't the type to just sit around all day and be happy doing so

On a similar topic this is one thing no government has ever sorted out, making work pay, as I was no better off at all working 1-2 days a week as its using petrol plus wear and tear etc.

But scroungers? The social club I go to, I hear it all the time.

There's one fella there who's never worked, he's on disability for a mental problem, you'd never really know it if you talked to him, and loads there say ""get a job"" etc, usually said jokingly but that must hurt being repeated all the time

The job I do, I interact with people from all walks of life, a few who've been on the dole all their lives and to be honest have no chance of working.

They'd be called scroungers, but the parents didn't work, their parents didn't work, and the cycle continues, plus a lot aren't the brightest and they've got mental problems.

A local hotel did a recruitment drive in winter time, the dole office sent the ones I've just talked about along.

The jobs were waiters/waitressing and I can tell you no one would want them serving food, their clothes are raggy, dirty hands etc.

Not saying it's their fault so much, no ones ever taught them different.

So of course they never got the job, a hotel isn't going to employ someone with black fingernails to dish out the steaks.

So again, the cycle continues and will keep continuing until there's a proper scheme to help these people, rather than the shitty disgusting sanction system and crappy workfare which doesn't work ",null,0,null,1433419407,null,0,false,0,crv7mj1,null,t3_38hmyd,null,t1_crv7mj1,null,t3_38hmyd,null,null,null,1436719727,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,hoffi_coffi,null,null,null,"I used to do reductions in a supermarket years ago and I (and many customers) often asked if we donated food to charity. We didn't, we binned it. The main thing I dealt in terms of numbers with was bread. Sometimes it would be trolleys full of it. Especially from the bakery where things had a shorter shelf life (french sticks would be rock hard). I was always told that it didn't make financial sense to donate it - the transport costs and the fact it wasn't a set amount each day meant it would cost more than just buying the stuff in (not that such a donation would have been made! Would it be worth a homeless shelter waiting for an unknown amount of stale bread to come in each night? Do they actually *want* this stuff? 

Fresh stuff wasn't too bad, we reduced it to the point where it was pennies, then the rest could probably fill a basket. Usually weird stuff or bashed up boxes. Then the chillers had some stuff to bin which was heavily bruised or off. Ambient stuff - hardly any, tins had such a long shelf life that they rarely needed chucking. Dented tins were reduced (again to pennies) and if they were really badly broken, we were told to bin them in case the food inside was damaged or the seal had gone. If stuff was out of date, apparently the store could be held liable if it was given away. Not sure if this would be the case, but as I said, this was only a small amount of stuff anyway. 

So I love the idea in theory, it sounds great not chucking out edible food, but I am not convinced it would actually necessarily help. If a set amount could be donated each day, maybe topped up with unsold goods, that could work? Either way it could kick supermarket up the arse, if they *have* to give away their unsold food, they might think about it and not overfill their shelves.

I don't know about childcare that well tbh as I'm not a parent but it's a major complaint of those I know who are. (as it basically forces one parent not to work, which has serious effects on their career and the economy of this country)

To be fair I was living in Exeter and Edinburgh which aren't cheap but compared to when I spent a month living in Salamanca or two summers in Hamburg and Berlin - the cost of housing in the UK is generally higher than abroad with the exception of other major cities  - I'm moving to Barcelona soon and the cost of housing there is slightly less as a fraction of wages, but that'll get you a reasonable (though still small) penthouse studio with a sunny terrace rather than a ridiculously small rabbit hutch studio like many of my friends in London have.

The UK really does have a housing crisis - it's not all just whining. We just didn't build enough shit for years, and where we did build it there aren't enough jobs because for graduate jobs it's insanely focused in London.

Ricky Lambert was at least as decent as Ings. Now Ings is much younger and has loads more potential and is available for ""free"", I get that. He also fits our style better than Lambert. He also played for a shit team. But right now, theres not really anything that suggest he would have been a difference for this club, if he had been here in place of Lambert. 

Borini played for an equally shit team, but didnt do quite as well, I agree. But lets not pretend that Ings set the world ablaze in Burnley compared to Borini. He did *slightly better*. Born fucking sucked for us and couldnt get in the team, and when he did play, he did next to nothing. We dont need someone who is slightly better than Borini in the squad.

why has it taken 9 months to try and negotiate it? how come Kane and Mason's deals were wrapped up quickly? he would be offered atleast on par with Mason which is 35k, and that is respectable.

btw, he isn't a defensive midfielder, so i don't see why you are trying to put him just behind Schneiderlin and Matic.

null,false,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,null,"Well I dunno. Most of the jobs are in London, the housing in London is truly grim and you pay a small fortune for the privilege of enduring it.

I looked at the cost of living and realised I was much better off in Barcelona as the PPP is better there even though the absolute salaries are lower.

If London stays too expensive to attract workers who aren't in Finance or whaterver earning like £60k (and I was offered £30k which while it isn't great for tech, it isn't too bad either for a first job) then they will just go elsewhere.

Berlin has tech companies too, as does Barcelona and the UK is shooting itself in the foot by putting everything in London and then making it far too expensive to live there.

Although one thing I _did_ notice and do have to concede is that some people are absolutely insistent on working in London - I'd want to live in the South to be near my family ideally but I really don't understand why some people demand to live in London because it's more 'sexy' or whatever and then complain about the standard of living. 

I just hope that if I come back to the UK I can come back on a more senior salary so London isn't so grim, or I can find a job in a different part of the UK.

It's a good point about repair costs too - but in my field I also have to worry about job security as technology companies aren't the most reliable in the world and so buying a house is a bit of a pain if I am quite likely to have to move. I just wish I didn't get wrecked by really high rental prices because of that. (But again, it's really only in London that it's insane.

My main advice would be to stop thinking of a career - in my mind, those days are over. There is no such thing anymore as a job for life, i.e. a career. Start thinking of finding a job that you don't mind and perhaps even enjoy. 

I gained average GCSEs, went onto to gain atrocious A-levels (Ds and Es) because I had no idea what I was doing. Somehow I got accepted into uni for a Psychology degree, pushed through and completed it because I figured a degree is better than no degree and came out realising that to get a career in psychology is nigh on impossible because I should've been writing papers and working as a research assistant all through uni.

Gave up, was unemployed for a year. Volunteered with a mental health charity just to get people off my back for being unemployed and lazy. Found out that a) I liked working with people, and b) I needed money.

Applied to a care work agency (btw agency work - any agency work - is the easiest job in the world to get) and got a zero-hour contract with minimum wage pay. Got sent to work in care homes. Didn't like that. Asked to be moved to the home care department. That was a little bit better but as it turns out care work is not really working ""with people"". You do a task, you get out, go to someone else, do a task, get out *ad nauseam*.

Got asked to cover a shift for an assisted living place and got assured that its not a nursing home. Fucking loved it. I was finally actually working with people. Eventually got asked by the manager to join their staff on a contract. Worked there for a year on £8 + change. Left after the politicking got to me. 

While working there, I met someone who was  physiotherapist. Their job sounded interesting so I researched my options, found a post-grad course and applied. Got in, gained my qualification, started working for another agency as a PT while doing applications for full-time posts. 

Eventually after another year, got a full-time temp post at a hospital. Worked there for a year, got depressed half-way through because of more politicking, found another job and quit. 

While working at the hospital though, I realised that I wanted to study medicine as there are many more options for work with a medical degree than plain old doctor. 

Am currently applying for a biology module from OU and applying for medical schools and seeing what happens.

I have a permanent, full-time job @ 27k in the meanwhile and if my ambitions don't happen, well I'm sure I can find something that'll keep my interest for a while. Maybe the biology stuff will lead me down another path. Who knows?

Life is long, I'm mid-thirties and bounced around from place to place with various jobs and by talking to people and lucking out I've somehow ended up where I am now. 

You're young and there's so many opportunities for you out there. You've tried retail and don't like it - great, you can cross that off the list. Find another job. Look through listings and apply to something that sounds interesting. If that doesn't work out, fine, find another job. I've known many people who get stuck in a rut purely because its easier to stick with what they know (even if they hate it) than it is go out there and change. And believe you me, change is as good as a holiday.

**TL;DR:** Get a new job, any job, that's not retail and see what happens. Don't think of getting a career - those days are over. Find a job that you're happy in. If you end up being happy and doing that job for 3, 5, 10 years great. If you're in a job that you hate, change. Its that easy if you're motivated enough.

If you take the money being spent on the likes of A4E, Maximus, sweetners paid to Workfare 'employers' and instead gave it to the unemployed in the form of individually tailored training packages (or even just a chunk of the raw cash for 6 months for those that generate their own, approved, plan) I think the vast majority of unemployed people would be able to sort themselves out. 

Most unemployed people (myself included) know exactly what the problem is, how to fix it and what local vendors can supply the thing for the best price.  It's a lack of raw cash and ability to save up for the thing in any reasonably time frame; as an example if a driving lesson costs £24p/h and you can save at most £1p/w from your JSA... by the time you're anywhere approaching the ability to past the practical test your theory certificate has expired and I'm being very generous with skill retention when it comes to the gap in-between lessons. 

But time and again, when the subject comes up... people would much rather just give the unemployed a bit more of a kicking than do anything meaningful to sort the situation out.

He's not world class, he's not going to get us the title, but it means we have money to spend on other players too. You can't just go out and get world class talent because all the other clubs will be looking for them too.

Just look what happened last year with Sanchez ending up at Arsenal and we ended up with our 5th choice in Balotelli because we couldn't get our other targets (or wouldn't pay them like Sanchez).

Milner is a great start to the transfer window, no-one is saying anything more.

As for bringing us closer to winning the league, he'll bring us closer to 4th which is closer to winning the league than 6th so yeah he will. But the league is at least 4 or 5 seasons away with good transfer windows in each of them and CL football.

We need to haul in Spurs, Arsenal and United and then get lucky with some signings and hope we get another Suarez, sort out our defence and then get very lucky and overhaul Chelsea and City.

As far as the comparisons go, Ings played for a worse side than Borini's Sunderland and scored more goals.  Lambert was superb for Soton, but didn't fit into our side at all.  Ings will fit much better, he has the qualities we tend to value and make the best use of when it comes to forwards.

No one is saying Ings will come in here and score 20 goals. He's not gong to show up and revolutionize our attack.  I also think I pretty clearly stated he'd be a good squad player, not a name for the first 11 consistently.  He has a lot of room to grow and could end up something special in time, so perhaps we can get the best from him and he can grow into that role for us.

As I already said, we also need a star player to come in, someone who is already top quality, ready to go straight into the first 11, and bring us at least 15 goals per season reliably.  Ings is not that, no one expects him to be that, and no one is claiming that he will be that.  Like it or not we have 0 reliable strikers at the club at all.  Sturridge is too injury prone to be counted on and then all of Balotelli, Borini, and Lambert are eithe rnot good enough or straight up the opposite of the type of player we need and won't be able to perform as a result.  1 striker isn't going to fix our problem there because the problem is much better than 1 player.",null,0,null,1433425499,null,0,false,0,crva60n,null,t3_38hs8x,null,t1_crva60n,null,t1_crv971c,null,null,null,1436721705,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Depending on your field of study and the type of essay questions you encounter, the tips I can offer for writing a good essay are: 

- Be analytical and have a coherent argument. Don't be descriptive. Narrative is a waste of time, only put in the necessary information to make your point. Critically engage the literature you are dealing with. Be persuasive and use empirical evidence and scholarly work to persuade and substantiate your own argument. 

- Have a coherent structure, linear argument, and make explicit indication of where your argument is going. Always show in the introduction what the reader is expected to read and what you hope to argue. The conclusion should reflect this by stating what you have looked at and what you have said. Conclusions tend to be evaluative and build upon your essay and provide an ultimate evaluation (but do not provide new information). 

- It's always so easy to forget throughout your essay - but link back to the essay question. Ensure that everything you write relates back to your central argument and the question at hand.

- Avoid using I - i.e, I argue and I believe etc. Better choice is, ""this study"" etc.

- Practice makes perfect. Asking for feedback and advice from your lecturer/advisor always helps, as you will often find each of them will have their own essay style preference. I've had some lecturers that wanted a balanced argument throughout and then a conclusion measuring the two sides. And some lecturers I've had wanted you to take one side of an argument and critically engage it throughout.

null,false,cac2008,null,null,null,"Sure enough. I don't donate to charities now though for a number of reasons:

1) Apart from a rare few, I see no evidence that their individual campaigns are effective. They're basically asking us to give them money with no proof that it leads to anything. The TV adverts try to emotionally lure us in without giving objective evidence of their past successes. We should be choosing who to give our money to based on evidence, not based on who hired the most expensive PR company.

2) There's often too many charities working towards the same thing. A quick search on CharityChoice returned over 50 breast cancer charities all doing basically the same thing. It seems to be in vogue to start a charity with someone's name on it, rather than fundraising or assisting an already established charity.

3) Many foreign/international aid charities are regularly criticised for making the problem worse, by disincentivising the government of these countries from taking any action. This issue is often discussed in international development degrees.

4) As a generalisation of above, most charities deal with symptoms, not causes. Whilst some people do indeed need the 'plaster' of a foodbank this does not deal with the deeper issue. Yes, charities dealing with international disaster response don't need to consider this, but a charity that aims to provide charitable help for higher education for children from BME groups only helps individuals, and doesn't even consider the *cause* of the issue.

5) Charities often benefit the state as opposed to the society. Any large scale support by charities or philanthropists to provide 'essential services' is fundamentally ethically wrong. It carries severe risks of altering the balance of funding from the public sector to the private sector, exposing those who are most at need to the vagaries of the market. Those most vulnerable then only receive fluctuating care of gradually decreasing quality.

6) Charities promote favouritism of causes, not fairness. People tend to donate to issues that appeal to them, but this then leads to money being diverted from needy but unpopular issues, to those in vogue. Instead aid for needy causes should be handled by the Government, but this one at the moment is looking for any excuse to pass the bill onto the private sector (see point 5).

TL:DR - there should be no need for charities, as it should be handled by the government. In attempting to start new charities, promote existing charities and support campaigns we are letting our existing government cut their social net even further.

1: The bank/finance company owning the property was the claim of the original post that started this, which you were replying to. That was a pretty big giveaway.

2: If you weren't referring to the bank, who exactly were you referring to? Since you have made no attempt to identify anyone other than the bank, and have engaged with discussion up to this point on the basis of discussion of the bank.

If you were referring to an entity other than the bank, perhaps you would like to explain what you were referring to, why it is that you feel that entity holds the legal estate, and why it is that you didn't feel the need to clarify that you were changing the topic of discussion when you chimed in on a topic in progress

I don't know when we past the point of no return but I only see it stretching into endless conflict until the Islamic faith starts to whither as religion fades with the passage of time.

We've spent years over there meddling to ensure good oil prices. The cost of that is a lot of people angry at our intervention and it boils over in the form of 'burn the infidels' because that's the only way that some of them can articulate their anger at being economically hamstrung, and having oppressive Sheiks propped up by Western money as those they rule over live in squalor devoid of respect of their basic human rights. Spot where the anger at the West comes from. How would you feel if, instead of spending money on schools and hospitals, Westminster announced it was going to buy Dynamo Kiev and take them to Champion's League glory?

As a result, you get people thinking it's all religiously motivated and so you get counter movements arguing that Islam is fundamentally opposed to Western ideals. But is it governments saying that or tenured Oxford professors publishing books calling people deluded? Is Dawkins in on the big conspiracy, or is his response to the violence his own decision?

The Establishment isn't furthering the rhetoric of Islam being opposed to the West; the very opposite is true. How often do you hear politicians and journalists trying desperately to keep the peace while private citizens go on a warpath against Islam? But of course the two sides are now so riled up to fever pitch that you end up with terrorists attacks clearly motivated by religion, exacerbating the problem, with both sides thinking that the solution to the dispute is more disagreement and a refusal to find a common ground (see: /r/atheism for one side, and any Islamist terror cell for the other).

There's a natural flow of events which is quite easy to trace. Tony Blair played a part but arguing that he's the culprit and that he therefore should't be in the job is daft. If anything he's a piece of the puzzle and having been exposed to a lot of this stuff on a level of detail which I (or you) can't grasp then could it just be slightly possible that he's better qualified for the role than you or me?",null,0,null,1433426679,null,0,false,0,crvaryk,null,t3_38hj9i,null,t1_crvaryk,null,t1_crva39o,null,null,null,1436722185,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

African kids are starving because their own countries are doing fuck all for them, something many of these charities are making worse by disincentivising any action from their own countries. Why should they have to do anything, if we'll feed and clothe the worse off in their own country?

That's a bit of a wide leap from talking about charity isn't it? No I don't think they should be fined, I think the bloody government should be fined and taken to court for allowing this situation to get in such a mess in the first place, but whilst charities are going to get these people they help they rightly need, they also ensure that the government will cross yet another social care topic off the balance sheet.

I'm actually ok with him dropping out of the champions league and giving up on any trophies because he wants to play every single week, and get a big fat signing bonus and crazy wages until he's 35.

Especially up to Christmas when he rejected the offer, but this is being treated like when Kagawa finally got out of United.

In the end, I think it's a good thing  that we didn't give him the 4 year deal and letting him go and replacing him with someone better is a sign we're looking to improve. No team in the last 8 of the CL would want him, and if we're aiming that high then we should be getting better players in. Especially as he's going into his 30's.

I don't think the UK options are that great, as already noted quite a few of the regulars are using Asian sunscreens. Do be careful with the alcohol content of some tho, that may well not suit your dry areas.

Do consider your budget: sunscreen can get quite expensive when you are applying and reapplying the recommended amount. That is at least half a teaspoon to face and neck, if you reapply once a day you would be using a teaspoon (5ml) a day which means a 50ml bottle will last just ten days.

Even when not dealing with PIH UK experts recommend we all use sunscreen whenever the UV index is 3+, which is many days from April onwards, including cloudy and rainy ones.

Lukaku wanted out - from what I understand he said he wanted to be starting regularly - which is a fair demand for an up-and-coming young striker - and we couldn't guarantee him that over Costa, our new signing. 

Bertrand and Salah were bought as young prospects - Cuadrado is 29. He was Fiorentina's best player, arguably. There is no 'he had potential but couldn't live up to it', he was as finished as he is going to get when we bought him.

And De Bruyne wasn't a Mourinho player. He was bought under a different manager with a different plan for Chelsea. Mourinho decided he wanted our well-drilled, well-disciplined team, and De Bruyne didn't fit into that.  
Sturridge was the same - bought by one manager with an idea for the team and playstyle, sold under a different manager with a different playstyle.

Also, how long were each of the aforementioned players at the club? Salah, IIRC, was with us for a year, and I don't think anyone else was there for less.

But, any worker in any company is going to want the wages that are commensurate with their value. In the world of football negotiations can be a bit messier than in, say, manufacturing because of agents and chairmen. But, at the end of the day Bentaleb is a current phenom and future star and if Levy pisses him off by quibbling about a few million quid then we deserve to remain the perennial underachievers. 
There are moments in time that define a club. 3 years ago we had a chance to take our success and push to the next level by signing Moutinho. It appears that Levy's standard negotiating tactics weren't right for that signing and we missed out. We were 1 point short of CL qualification that year - a point that having Moutinho on the team would have easily remedied.
A year later Gareth Bale's pic is displayed in Times Square in NY as NBC gains EPL broadcast rights in the U.S. Breaking the bank for Gareth would have provided unlimited exposure for Spurs in the U.S. creating multiples of fans greater than we currently have here. Instead, we sold Gareth and NBC coverage opened at Anfield and Spurs are a distant 5th or 6th interest in U.S. coverage.
I'm not saying we need to break the bank on all signings - in fact I generally admire Levy's operation. But, a real leader knows when to bend philosophy to maximize growth and Levy is too steadfast in his own rules to recognize this. If we lose Bentaleb because we are unwilling to pay him his worth, then we are idiots who deserve what we get.

My impression of this, having done the charity gig and been involved with some homeless charities, is that most people would rather pull the ""I need a few quid for a bus to get home routine"" rather than attempt to impersonate a charity which potentially requires a bib, id card, forms, clipboard, some charity related materials etc. 

And then when you consider how people actively avoid chuggers and that in most cases chuggers don't even have the ability or permission to take cash I consider it unlikely. I'm sure it happens, but I think it is pretty rare. 

What does happen with more regularity are scam callers impersonating charities and scam door-to-door people as the chances of getting caught are significantly lower. That's my take anyway.

now, what i want fans expectations to be is that he will be adjusting to the league, team, coach, and everything else around him, but much quicker than we might expect. this season should see him get 10-20 matches and score somewhere between 5-10 goals. anything else will be a massive bonus.

We've also got about 20 stadiums that make the Emirates look like an outdated dump. I'm not exaggerating either, I've been in the Emirates several times (Gooner). The corporate facilities in your average NFL stadium are staggering compared to it, and most of those NFL stadiums are about 6-7,000 seats bigger too. 

Plus you vastly underestimate how many Americans care about football. The World Cup final got 5 million more viewers in the USA than it did in the UK (26.5m vs 21m). Obviously the UK has 1/5th the population, but football is among the most important cultural activities in this country, if not the single most important. There is a huge gulf between that and not giving a shit about football. MLS has shown huge growth and there are a legion of leagues that Americans follow - the Mexican League is arguably the most popular of all due to the huge Mexican/Hispanic population and the Premier League gets 500,000-1 million viewers on a cable channel early in the morning (a 12.45 kickoff is 4.45 am where I grew up). I grew up in the US and remember pre-1994 World Cup, the game was barely on TV except on niche channels for foreign people, you couldn't buy a shirt if you wanted one, and the US national team was comprised of college kids and played most of their games in front of about 5-10,000 people unless it was a plumb friendly. To see the growth is staggering - soccer is basically mainstream now. 

We shouldn't have the World Cup in 2022 though, just because it looks really bad, as if we only initiated proceedings to get the WC. That's not what the Justice Department does (we have a military base in Qatar, so this could get real sticky), but people abroad will believe it.

I can't think of a possible reason why Arsenal would want Milner, especially with 150k/week but even if they did want him the only reason Milner would choose Liverpool over Arsenal would be a guaranteed spot in the starting 11, can't really be that proud to beat a rival to a transfer on those grounds, that is if Arsenal were even seriously interested at all which I very much doubt.  Under no grounds would Arsenal make Milner their highest earner above Ozil and Sanchez and take away their playing time for Milner to play.

However, I do have an issue with the fact that the establishment is perfectly happy to use aspects of Brendan Hughes' interviews to arrest republicans, but conveniently enough the Police Ombudsman then strikes out the only mitigating circumstances* mentioned in that same evidence. It sets off alarm bells that the judiciary appear to be picking and choosing convenient parts of the same sources of evidence to suit their prosecution.

My problem isn't with the case being brought against Ivor Bell. I actually agree with his prosecution. I'm just concerned at the way in which the available evidence is being interpreted.

I would like to see justice for all parties, but it appears as though politics and attitudes are so deeply entrenched on both sides that it's going to be a long time before Northern Ireland can move further forward.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"First off both renting and home ownership have their place in society - I even rent myself.

 That said it's roughly a zero-sum game. In the long run any rational landlord must make at least enough money to cover the cost of owning a property, renting it out and repairs. Those costs are baked into the rental of any property. The only exceptions are where landlords are actually making a loss which is only [~10%+ of all landlords](http://www.landlords.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/quarter-small-landlords-break-even-or-run-loss).

Ergo renting does cost slightly more *in the long run* than home ownership but without the variance of having to deal with repairs. Ownership (whether living in the property or renting it out) is slightly cheaper *in the long run* but with increased variance &amp; risk (e.g. repairs and leveraging).

I often read that owners deride the cost of unexpected repairs and use this as justification of owning as being more expensive than renting. Yet even landlords still have these costs and yet rationally must still come out on top (or at least break even) in the long term for it to be worth owning property. One difference here however is that those who own &amp; live in their home might make most costly repairs more often than a landlord (since they gain the direct benefit by living in the property).

*presumably either they don't realise or are speculating on property prices.

There is another whole slew of calculations taking leveraging and capital gains (including taxes!) into account which makes the whole system much more complicated than this but sufficed to say: if someone is making money they must be making it from somewhere and they sure as hell aren't making it from the banks.",null,0,null,1433431648,null,0,false,0,crvdndg,null,t3_38ettx,null,t1_crvdndg,null,t1_crv8sv1,null,null,null,1436723657,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

That is a very significant amount. Man U who finished 4th are more than double and they're absolutely going to spend about £100m on incoming transfers, with or without selling players. That kind of financial muscle is not possible to compete with, flat out. Arsenal in 4th there are about 2/3rds higher/have 5/3rds the revenue and wages.

I don't really disagree (I live here after all), I just think shitting on the US is the wrong way to go. The US held a great World Cup and could hold one again tomorrow. Just because they don't live and die football like English people do is an unrealistic standard, there's very few nations on earth like that. Even nations with World Cup trophies (cough France cough) don't live like that. 

Also, the last bid by England was the first that didn't assume England had a natural birthright to host the Cup 'cause that's where football comes from. By all accounts the 2000 bid was massively self-satisified with lots of handwaving away about stadiums that, at that time, had not been replaced or refurbished, and they lost UEFA support by double crossing Germany (who it was believed had let England host Euro 96 in a quid pro quo).

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"I think the argument for austerity and balancing the budget faster is more to do with uncertainty, hence the notion of being fiscally conservative. People are too quick to shoot down the idea of austerity without trying to understand the merits the startergy may hold. IMO there are several reasons why austerity and reducing debt quickly is important, firstly another recession will strike one day and going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre.
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult to achieve. It's worth pausing to think that Japan which has the oldest population in the world and who is also a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past decade. The other looming issue is that of European stagnation and an overall global slowdown which could hit the UK hard as it searches for new markets outside of its shrinking pool of consumers.
The country is sold on austerity, the next government has a clear mandate off the public, to rebalance the economy and get debt down as fast as possible. It’s rare for a public to be sold on the idea of less public spending, other social democracies struggle to cut spending programs and end up having to pray for growth to return as debt continues to build up. We don’t, we can take a faster route using both growth and reductions.
My fear is that if we don’t take the Conservatives opportunity to reduce debt, we may never do it. Governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although its gets there by slightly different means.
If the UK’s debt can be dealt with now when we have both the political will and the means then lets do it before we have a government that doesn’t have either the will or the means. Having said all that weak global demand is making me pause for thought, I am by no means convinced by the policy.",null,0,null,1433434985,null,0,false,0,crvfr1w,null,t3_38ib57,null,t1_crvfr1w,null,t1_crvb5so,null,null,null,1437572290,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

25-30% is a massive overestimate of the UK's net contribution to the EU budget. Digging out the full current data is a bit difficult, but [here's a nice table from 2011](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union). For 2011, the total budget is 118.4 billion euros, of which the UK contributes 11.2 bn and receives 6.6 bn. 

Based on the linked data, if the UK left, income would fall to 107.2 bn, and expenditure would fall to 111.8 bn. So there would be a budget hole if the UK left, but from 2011 figures it's about 4%, not 25-30%. It would be a bit greater now as the UK's net contribution has been increased by about 10-20% in recent years with the GDP revaluation, but still in the single-digit percent level.

Where Patrick Stewart can read a headline and see the bakery claiming they're being forced to endorse a message they find offensive, a judge can look at the law and see that printing a message does not equate to endorsing it, either in common perception or in law.

null,false,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"Although a woman *sans penis* can't commit rape by the strict definition of S1 SOA, she can commit the S4 offence of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The burdens of consent etc. are identical, and if the offence involves the victim penetrating someone's anus or vagina with any of their body parts (so a female forcing a male (or female) to have sex with them), then the sentence is a mandatory life one.

All law is, to a greater or lesser extent, an attempt to categorise certain wrongs. You could easily construct the legislation (like burglary, with the theft act) to have a number of 'parts' to rape. S1 SOA rape could easily be S1(a) rape, s2 SOA assault by penetration could as easily be S1(b) rape and so on. But why? What purpose is that achieving?

There is some argument to suggest that rape and assault by penetration is a distinction too far, but that's legislation for you - the government of the day decided that this is how they wished to define it, and that's that.

null,false,Nymthae,null,null,null,"To second year is the worst jump personally (Chemistry). I had no flexibility in second year so all my lectures counted, and counted equally. Plus lab reports and lab hours were a big chunk of every week which was something that increased a lot between first and second year. They just *expect* more of you, which I think makes it harder. I could've done so much more work though, I did the bare minimum (tutorials, lab reports) well, and didn't bother with revision until right before the exams. If i'd have been doing worse it might've kicked me into more work, I don't know, you do whatever you're satisfied with. I valued having free time to do other things that kept me relaxed and less one-dimensional. 


Inherently, I was just bad at one area but I had no interest in it so it was difficult to do anything about it compared to the other bits. As long as you just keep attending and do what is expected of you to a reasonable level you should be able to maintain your grade. If you want to improve then it's looking at the inefficiencies in your working (whether it's doing more work, or doing it in a more productive manner). 


73 / 69.5 / 70 and just finished fourth year. Probably coming out with a 2.1 though. I have a job lined up though so a 2.1 or a first makes zero difference. The main benefit of my 'position' was effectively being guaranteed a 2.1. If you can work hard in early years then it does take off the pressure later on as well as building a stronger foundation. 


I did a year out in industry for third year however - completely different kettle of fish. Most time intensive (work 40 hrs/week, self-study modules, dissertation, presentation) but I really enjoyed working in a working week routine. 


As a general observation: by third year, it seems people have worked out how to work a bit better and there's no real jump in work load - it's just different work or more taxing mentally but it didn't pile an extra load of assessments or anything. Also tend to prioritise doing a bit of work over going out most nights. 


On my course, most people do far better in their final (fourth) year because of the project element.

Alcohol is used socially and people know their limits and can enjoy a beer, but note it causes huge problems and it is an offence to drive or fly an aircraft when drunk, for example. I wouldn't turn up to work drunk, but I know that having had a pint the night before will not affect me the next day. Alcoholics may be drastically.affected by their addiction, however.

Cannabis, I have no doubt most people can enjoy recreqtioanlly and not to the detriment of their work or life in general. But again, it is psychoactive and illegal to use,  (whether it should be is obviously.debatable, I believe it should be legalised). But it's again strong enough to make driving or working in critical jobs a bad idea whilst high.

Then we have drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine... A completely different class of.drug and I'd hope you'd find few who would advocate the 'right' of anyone in a role where public safety was at risk being allowed to use them 'recreationally'. I personally.don't believe that there is such a thing as social or.recreational use of this class of drugs - they're too damaging.

So I think it's right and proper that there is drug testing in many jobs. I think that anything to do,with aerospace is one of them. whether cannabis is included or should be is up for debate, but I know many people in excellent jobs who refrain from drug use because it would end their career overnight if they failed a drug test. Thats their choice and their priorities.

Unless you think buying RBS shares is the best way for the government to get a good return on its money, it should sell and use the money for something else. Money invested in education or R&amp;D funding would deliver far greater returns than x billion pounds invested in RBS. Putting it towards paying off the debt would be a far lower risk investment, albeit one that currently has a crap return. Putting towards normal spending that allowed an equal reduction in taxes would let individuals and businesses make their own investments, which would probably in general do better and with less risk than RBS.

The initial investment was arguably a good one, because it had the payoff of helping to prevent the collapse of the entire financial system, and because the government was one of few groups capable of making the investment at the time. Now that the urgent danger has passed, the government should accept the loss, sell the shares and redeploy the capital somewhere it can make a real difference. Whether you think that should be in debt repayment, infrastructure, schools or whatever is a matter of politics as much as economics, but I don't see anybody campaigning for the government to invest *more* in banks.

I am saying that the share price reflects all the available public information at any given point in time.  Random walk is a corollary of the EMH, by the way.

&gt;If an investment manager can make money it means that the market is not efficient does it not?

No?  The market averages a positive return over the long term.  Just because the fund manager doesn't beat it consistently doesn't mean his fund's return is necessarily negative.  The market can yield an average of (say) 15% and the fund manager an average of 10%.  He's still 'making money', and it doesn't suggest anything about the market being inefficient.

Is this maybe some conflation about what it means to 'beat the market'?  When we say that we mean that you outperform the market by achieving a consistently higher rate of return than it does, not merely that you don't lose money.

I made a point of using the word generally for this reason.  Markets are generally efficient.  The inefficiencies you're talking about are not material to this discussion.

We are asking the question ""Does RBS' share price reflect its expected growth?"".  For all practical purposes in the long-term divestment of the government from a large holding of RBS stock the answer is 'yes'.

I don't think Navas' style is a good fit for the rest of the team and its regular starters. I don't think he brings as much to the table as a winger can. I think that Nasri's form early in the year is a much better example of the most effective wing play for us. In particular, that creative element on the ball is critical for me in our attack. So, I don't see Navas as having a big role here, and certainly not as a starter. I would rather explore what may become of Nasri, Jovetic, or (before he left) Milner in that role. However, Navas can be a good situational sub where pace and crosses in is really what's needed, perhaps late in a game or the like. The question then is if his wages are worth it. I think we could probably get a very similar player much cheaper. 

Of course, Nasri had a big drop in form and reportedly big disagreements with Pellegrini. Nasri also never ran back on defense as much. Nevertheless, for the reasons given above, if choosing between the two, I would rather try to repair Nasri (and even Jovetic) for his greater potential to become a first choice player on one of the wings. For some reason I don't think that's what's going to happen though.

&gt;BUT financial analysts Deloitte predict better days ahead now Ladbrokes have signed sponsorship deal.

&gt;THE Scottish Premiership suffered an £11million hit in revenue during season 2013-14, it can be revealed.

&gt;Financial analysts Deloitte released the figures as it was announced EPL clubs achieved record profits – soaring by 29 per cent to £3.26billion.

&gt;But it’s gloomier news north of the border, with the numbers largely down to Celtic’s £11m drop in total revenue due to poorer records in cup competitions.

&gt;The figures relate to the season before last – the first campaign as the rebranded SPFL Premiership – with the top flight enduring an 11 per cent drop in revenue.

&gt;The Hoops accounted for more than half of both the total revenue and total wage costs of the top-tier outfits.

&gt;They generated £64m in revenue that season, compared with less than £6m on average for the other 11 clubs.

&gt;However, on a brighter note Deloitte predicted more postive times ahead. The SPFL recently signed a four-year deal with Ladbrokers to make them their title sponsor – our league’s first one in two years.

&gt;The deal is worth around £4m.",null,0,null,1433441062,null,0,false,0,crvjp43,null,t3_38jqn9,null,t1_crvjp43,null,t3_38jqn9,null,null,null,1436728035,null,3,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,3,null

Germany's export-driven model, alongside the single currency, is one of the chief causes of the crises in the Mediterranean States, and ultimately it will come back and bite them in the arse (or be moved elsewhere).  German banks are precarious things at present, and a lot of their insurers in the UK/US are a bit nervous to tell you the truth.

&gt;One issue with socialism/communism is that there is never an incentive to do well. 

Surely, assuming capitalist arguments about motivation simply being related to money are true (hint, they aren't, or at least, it's more complex), then if the workers is getting the full value of their labour, rather than just a slice of it, they will be _more_ motivated to ""do well""?  Whatever ""do well"" might mean in this case.

null,false,HiFiHair,null,null,null,"&gt;Labour hasn't been a truly socialist party in a long time and their only election victory in the last thirty years (correct me on that?) has come from Blair's centrist approach.

Re: the 1997 Labour win, a centrist approach combined with an electorate perhaps tired of almost 20 years of continuous Conservative government, a John Major administration mired by scandal and perceived economic mismanagement, a Scotland yet to be disillusioned by the ""Red Tories"" and all of this prior to the rise of UKIP.

It seems unlikely we'll get that combination again. Which is why I think it's so wrong-headed of the Labour candidates to be nostalgic for 1997. The conditions aren't the same.

Labour's move to the centre and the rise of Scottish and English nationalism have lost Scotland to the SNP and increasingly the North of England to UKIP (seen by many as the new party of the working class). The Tories are holding their traditional base and have made gains from Labour again due to English nationalism and irrational fear of the SNP.

Labour won't challenge this by being Tory lite, as they were in 1997. In fact in many ways Blair was more Tory than the Tories in 1997 - he advocated lower taxes, took a more authoritarian stance on police and justice. But I think taking a similar approach now, with their traditional base eroded, would be very damaging for Labour; it'd cement the positions of SNP and UKIP defectors without offering a reason for Tory voters to abandon a Tory party which is currently strong.

I'm a Labour supporter. But right now I don't see an obvious strategy for Labour to remain relevant in the new political landscape.

Personally, I'm a socialist but not a communist, although I think it makes a fine utopia to aim for.
