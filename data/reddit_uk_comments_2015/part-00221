We were at our best (Decemberish - February) with Dembele at CAM, no one can deny that. He could hold up the ball long enough without getting crowded out or losing possession, and Eriksen on the left had much more time to compose himself and influence the game. We've looked toothless since Dembele was benched in March.

This sub is so fickle and ripe with double standards:

* Dembele doesn't score enough despite not really being bought to be a goal scorer, but we're fine with Eriksen/Lamela/Townsend/Soldado almost never scoring lately. 
* In the pivot we still expect him to score, but we never hold Mason and Bentaleb to those same standards. 
* We think his lack of chance-creating passes and through balls is a deal breaker, but praise Bentaleb for being a cog in the machine and not making risky passes in favor of keeping possession.
* His ability to hold the ball under pressure is amazing but not apparently worth it, yet every time we see Eriksen crowded out at CAM we bemoan our luck to continue losing possession in the middle.
* On a similar note, he has amazing ability to hold on to the ball and give others around him time to get involved in the play, and then wonder why Kane's looked so isolated since Dembele was benched.

Seriously, I hate reading comments in threads like this. On his day, the guy is one of our best, toughest, and most reliable players.

I have never rated Guzan very highly. Villa have had, in modern years, a number of outstanding keepers (bosnich, james, schmeical, friedel) and he isn't in the same category. Probably similar to Sorensen, but much better than Enckelman.

He had (I think) two solid seasons where he proved he was capable of playing in the premier league.

This season, his form has been erratic. The clips you won't be able to see are the numerous times he's made minor mistakes - coming out for crosses when he has no chance, or not coming out when he should have. He's lost a lot of confidence. In fairness it doesn't help playing infront of a poor back four.

At his best, he's a capable mid-table PL keeper. He hasn't been at his best this season. Sherwood clearly doesn't fancy him and Given can't be relied on to play a full season, not at 40.

hmm

few things to consider: 

RBS was a blow up of unbelievable scale. Perhaps we should applaud the Gov for downplaying it to the extent that public attitudes are where they are now.

Since being bailed out, it has undergone numerous tranches of asset sales, to cover the costs of its underperforming/failed assets. Thats essentially selling good to cover bad. 

Automatically, each of these sales decreases the attraction for investors and revenue generation avenues.

Right now, the stock is still underperforming.
 
Here is a comparison with several indices around the world including the FTSE, DAX, SP500, Nikkei and Shanghai composite

http://cl.ly/image/3g3K2l1V382Q

now many out there claim that due to a bond bubble, investors are forced into stocks to hunt yield, which is why indices have been posting all time highs all through 2014 and 15, leading to many to expect a sharp correction in stocks in Q3 this year.

This could be a smart trade by the Treasury... seeing the writing on the wall, and offloading a position which could tank even further... If you see Risk management from this perspective, they are probably saving the tax payer several more billion than they are perceived to be loosing. 

Also, it could be claimed that RBS being defacto Gov owned has restricted it from getting back to the levels it could be considered to be fair value.",null,0,null,1434003884,null,0,false,0,cs2rmgl,null,t3_39cmnp,null,t1_cs2rmgl,null,t3_39cmnp,null,null,null,1436902015,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Glad you enjoyed it anyway. The next one is the first one I didn't write and is part of another two parter. It's written by my friend, we put fake names in the script by the way. We wanted to get to the daleks quickly because they're key to the doctor in this series (You'll find out soon). 

The tone is quite different, especially in the second part. I'm interested to see what you think, here is the link below (I'll be also posting it on the main page, but I might as well send you it now)...

The victim in a case of rape or one of the sexual offences listed in the 1992 Act is entitled to 'anonymity' in the press. Once an allegation of one of the relevant offences has been made, nothing can be published which is likely to lead members of the public to identify the victim. The offences listed in the 1992 Act include most offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, part 1.

In this case the victim involved was part of a sexual crime, and didn't want her privacy violated any further, so what I assume is that naming the offender might identify the victim. He is also in jail for 16 years, meaning that the victim is not in any immediate danger.

Studge - we agree on, that's cool.

2012 was 3 years ago, and he's since been a bench keeper for Bolton and  subsequently released. I didn't say Bogdan isn't better, but he certainly isn't some dramatic improvement. Obviously the first choice is the first choice for a reason mate. What I'm saying, is that there is no need for such a dramatic difference in quality between number 1 and number 2.

I'd rather us not bring in Falcao to be honest, he seems too much like another Shevchenko or Torres, but on the plus side he won't have either the transfer fee or general squad importance of either of those two players. Torres fucked us not only because he was bad but because of his huge transfer fee and wages that crippled the club from being able to move on from him, Falcao might end up being shit but we can just cut ties with him in a year and we have Costa and presumably Remy. On the other hand there's always the chance that after another year removed from his injury he makes a bit of a comeback and is closer to his previous level which would probably mean we win the league again to be honest.

Where I work 90% of patients who are admitted are seen by a consultant within 6 hours. Some of the 10% are because they have been triaged and assessed by a senior registrar and transferred to another hospital, or some who present very close to an inevitable death. It used to be the case that consultant ward round the following morning would be seeing 30+ patients who may have presented almost 24 hours ago.

This is because a&amp;e had to change, and drag the rest of the hospital with it.  It has been successful in driving change.

null,false,Harrison88,null,null,null,"Something doesn't smell right here. Either, they think you didn't tell them he was self employed and should have completed a tax return, or he received notices in advance asking him to complete one. He wouldn't have just got one letter with £1,800 in fines and penalties. He must have received letters telling him he is due to fill out a tax return, reminder letters, the first £100 penalty notice, then further notices informing him of growing penalties. All of that would have happened before going to bailiffs.

Unfortunately, you've already submitted the tax return so can't ask for it to be withdrawn (if you don't feel one was legally required). It's not just self employment when you submit a tax return, it can be any untaxed/under taxed income (e.g. high pension with multiple sources of income).

Best advice is to call HMRC, ask to dispute the charges. They'll tell you to write a letter and complete a form SA370 (note the letter at the end of your reason in the relevant box on the form, make life easy for them). If you can, get advice from an accountant as to the wording. You will have a better chance that way. Alternatively, you can save money and do the letter yourself (addressed from and signed by him).

You might struggle with the first appeal - they have certain reasons they will allow penalties to be removed but they're short term but they have been a bit more flexible recently. You want to dispute why you didn't need to submit one and therefore shouldn't have to file at all. Tell them you filed as you were worried about further penalties but you dispute needing to file in the first place if all of his income was already taxed at source (note: I don't know the full facts of your case). If he received notice to file and ignored it back in early 2014, you're going to struggle to do anything other than prove why £1,800 is something he can't afford and ask them to reduce it. You'll have better luck with the first tier tribunal that you can take it to if the first appeal fails.

If some group of social justice warriors get to dictate what to ban or not this website will become a shadow of it's former self. These people are professional victims who seek to be offended and triggered at anything and everything so the possibility that one of these people could get to control what speech is allowed or not is terrifying.

Another thing I noticed, which is off topic, is how people like FPH can garner large support by turning fat people into villains. ""I hate fat people because they are a burden on the health system, your taxes are all spent helping these fat people!"", these types of statement rile up the masses and turn these against all fat people. It is a strange new form of controlling people. Another time I noticed it was when Elon Musk said people driving cars will be a thing of the past. A few stood up and basically said that will never happen, I will always drive myself because its my favorite pastime. These people where vilified because people starting saying stuff like ""Do you know how many people die each year in road accidents? I'm not letting you put my life in danger because you want to drive you greedy fuck!"". There is this dangerous push of trying to control everything people are allowed and not allowed to do because there may be an element of danger evolved. These people are actively pushing for a nanny state and smearing those who want personal freedom. Scary times.

When you refer to a bailiff, do you mean an actual bailiff, or someone from HMRC? This is important because if it's a bailiff it's been through the courts and it's rotting on his credit status.

Find out:    
a. What was the basis for requiring a return.    
b. Who provided that information.    
c. When was a notice to file issued by HMRC?    
d. What address was it sent to?    
e. Was it actually received? (That one's for you, not HMRC.)    
f. On what dates were penalty notices issued?    
g. What address(es) were they sent to?

On top of this, has any return been submitted?

Those questions should be enough to get an idea of whether the penalties are legally due. If no notice to file was issued, the return didn't have to be submitted. Similarly, if the notice to submit a return or penalty notices weren't served on the right address they're not valid.

HMRC seems to issue penalties without any human interaction or human intelligence, so it's probable no one has ever looked at it. HMRC's debt collectors just pursue the debt on file, so they wouldn't see any underlying failures.

Finally, look into whether a, 'reasonable excuse' exists. Reasonable excuse is a particular thing in this case, Google it and see if there are relevant circumstances.

Interestingly enough HMRC has been getting it in the neck recently for just waiving penalties.

If the shape of a 'crash' was a deep dip followed by a return to current levels or higher then, so long as you're buying or rebalancing throughout, you'd benefit from having bought while they were down. But if they stay down afterwards for longer than whatever time horizon you have in mind then you've lost out.

How it compares to 100% stocks is even more of a crapshoot because it depends entirely on how *that* market performs in the same time period.

&gt; The flat is in London and I expect to be able to rent it out for £500 more than the mortgage cost, what are my income tax implications? 

You pay tax on the profit. That is, you can deduct the cost of the mortgage *interest* as well as other things like repairs, wear &amp; tear, etc.

&gt; We own it between me and my girlfriend so any income would split between the two of us.

Yes - you will each need to fill out a self-assesment. Or hire an accountant to do it for you.

&gt; While I'm not living in the UK I want to rent out the flat that I own. I don't want to have to tell me mortgage provider about this as I think that would mean my mortgage will be more expensive. Is this illegal to do and what would happen if they found out?

Welcome to mortgage fraud! http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-2462805/Can-I-let-new-house-telling-lender.html

You've broken your contract with them. This will not end well for you.

&gt;  Assuming i keep paying the mortgage, how would they ever find out?

The names on the bills will change, or you'll ask the bank to send the statements elsewhere (unless you want the renter reading your financial info), or any one of a hundred small mistakes.

&gt; If I get landlords insurance is that effected by the fact I haven't told my mortgage provider?

The terms and conditions will almost certainly say ""you must have permission to let"".  They will want to know who has an interest in the property before they insure.

If you lie about it - or try to use regular insurance - you'll be committing fraud.

&gt; Am I silly to get a family member to help manage it while I'm away and would it be better to pay for a renting agency to do it?

Very silly.  Does your family member know how to draw up a legal contract? Do they know how to register a deposit in a scheme? Do they understand what legal checks must be performed on tenets?

&gt; Has anyone done anything like this and got any helpful hits and tips?

Either get consent to let, or switch your mortgage to a BTL product. You can do this with the same mortgage provider you're on now.

Get a managing agent who can make sure everything is legal - safety checks, deposits, contracts, etc.  You can have a friend / family member do the repairs etc - but they won't be much cheaper than an agent.

Speak to an accountant about being a non-resident landlord https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/rent

Interesting metaphors, but not really applicable.

Targeted surveillance of internet traffic is not like 'finding a needle in a haystack', it's like finding An A4 document containing the information you want, amongst a warehouse full of files full of A4 documents, you're going to have to give each document a cursory read, to see if it's relevant. It's not a needle in a haystack, it's a needle in a needle-stack. So you have to look at all the needles, to decide which needle is the one you wanted.

My preferred approach is for all the 'needles' to be looked at superficially as they pass by, and only those which match criteria from a warrant or specific tasking, be interrogated more deeply. And for everything else to not be recorded.

In practical terms, this would mean looking at IP and TCP packet header data ephemerally, and only looking at anything else, should a target IP addresss be present. i.e. You have a warrant to investigate joe bloggs's internet activity, because he's suspected of a crime - so you get his IP, and you have the ISP pass you only traffic originating from his IP, at times the ISP confirms it was assigned to him.

&gt;which is what they're currently doing

LE communication surveillance was previously conducted in a manner fairly close to how I would prefer it done. GCHQ is a different beast altogether, and it gets murky when you wade into the law governing it, and the fact that they are fairly comfortable ignoring the law when it suits their purpose.

To get back on topic. Whether or not the mobile phone surveillance at issue is acceptable, would depend entirely on what is done with the incidentally collected data. If you're only looking for joe blogg's phone, and you don't retain or interrogate any of the other devices observed, then I think that's OK. If this device just stores all the data it can get its hands on, then that's not OK, but because they're being so secretive, we just don't know.",null,0,null,1434015295,null,0,1434015562,0,cs2uugg,null,t3_39aopu,null,t1_cs2uugg,null,t1_cs2ugqf,null,null,null,1437560522,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Like any other country of size and influence, Russia has a history of sponsoring disruptive elements in other countries to weaken its rivals, and it's no great stretch to imagine that they have budgets and departments earmarked for ""interference"".

Right now Russia wants the EU to be weakened, to wrest influence back over the former Warsaw Pact states. Getting any state to leave the EU, or at least paralyse it, is an obvious goal. I find it hard to imagine that Russia *hasn't* provided some sort of covert support to UKIP, or that it isn't doing the same with other notable anti-EU groups in EU member states. 

What I *don't* think is that this is a mutually agreed arrangement; during the Cold War the Soviet Union helped disruptive groups in the West without their direct knowledge, and those techniques won't have been forgotten.

Buddhism (what little I know of it) seems much more like a way of life rather than a belief in some supernatural being that will make it all better once you die.

* Wisdom (This will change when we sign  new RB)
* Moreno
* Skrtel

I'm not saying that all landlords are a curse on the country or that rental properties are a bad idea. They fill a very necessary role in our economy in providing short-mid term accommodation for people who don't want to put down their roots yet.

But the problem is that houses are a necessity and very limited in availability, so we can't have some people owning all the houses and everyone else being forced to rent because they can never outbid the property investors with greater capital, which is what is happening now. It's not a fair free market at all.

Essentially, property investors (as a whole) are acting like a monopoly, using their immense capital to buy up any property that comes on sale before an actual home owner can get it, or outbid them on it because they know they can make a long term profit on renting it out.

You may have worked your way up from nothing, but so what? That doesn't make it ok for you to become a property monopoly.

Basically, Cameron **has** to get the numbers down. He's got 5 years of government in a party with a long history of tearing itself apart over Europe, and we all know that for the most part Europe is a proxy for the dirty word ""immigration"". Chances are in 5 years time we'll have voted to stay in the EU... but that isn't going to kill UKIP or euro-skepticism, in precisely the same way that the Scottish independence referendum hasn't killed Scottish nationalism - it's emboldened it to new highs. If he hasn't made some progress on the great 'Immigration Elephant in the Room' his party will suffer for it at the polls, potentially drastically if there is a split or a UKIP resurgence. It's probably worth pointing out for people that don't live in the South that UKIPs GE performance is probably a poor indicator of their popularity, as a lot of last minute UKIP would-be voters swung back to the Tories because of the perceived threat of a Labour-SNP alliance. 

So how does he get the numbers down? He can't turn away Europeans because of the EU... although he can make the idea of coming to the UK less appealing. The problem with that is a lot of the poorer EU nations that make up the bulk of our migrants are in such a dire state anyway that the UK is still appealing even if the lure of social welfare is withdrawn. Plus, he'll know that the evidence doesn't really back-up the idea that immigrants are coming here for benefits (although many clearly do claim in work benefits). The only thing he can change is non-EU immigration... so that's what he's doing.

The irony is, UKIP have long argued that being a member of the EU is bad for immigration - because it prevents us recruiting talented people from around the world, and forces us to accept anybody from Europe.

Absolutely!  As I said - you can always find a few nuts who will question anything.  In Pinker's case he's continually beset by ideologues who want to take him down a peg or two but so what?  The existence of naysayers is not evidence that they have a point.  The only thing which matters is whether their arguments can stand up to criticism.  And they don't, because there's just no getting away from the fact that Pinker and Roser have got the data on their side, whereas their critics have nothing except ideology.

null,false,bobstay,null,null,null,"&gt; Do you think that accessing the UK by train is the best way to see the most of England/Northern Ireland bringing my bike with me?

Apologies if this comes off as flippant but - the best way of seeing the UK by bike is... by bike. In a month, you can travel a long way. The entire country is only 550 miles long - you could do that in a week if you're happy doing 100 miles a day. You'll see so much more on a bike than looking out of a train window - and you can stop at any time when you find something interesting.

There's a [National cycle network](http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map) which avoids fast roads and will take you through some lovely back roads, quiet places, and little villages. A good site for planning your route using it is  [Bikehike](http://www.bikehike.co.uk/mapview.php) (click OSMCycle at the top right of the map).

If you do need to travel a long way with a bike, though, the train is definitely your best bet, although it's far from cheap. Maybe two or three train trips, and the rest by bike?

A note on camping - in most of the UK (scotland and dartmoor excluded) it's illegal to wild-camp. People do it, but you'd have to be careful to hide yourself well. Campsites (campgrounds) tend to be quite well organised with good facilities (showers, toilets, etc), but also not so cheap (budget £10-15 a night for a small tent). A good website for campsites and reviews is [UKCampsite](http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/) which has a bit of an archaic search system but lots of reviews of each site.

Edit: Oh, and if you're choosing a tent, consider getting one that goes up outer-first or all at once. It rains here!

In England I'd suggest Manchester is a an excellent option. The city (by name) itself is not huge but its in the middle of a big conurbation (Greater Manchester) so lots of people and lots of big towns near by. Loads of choice of places to live, easy to commute, plenty of cheap but safe areas (as well as some cheap but dangerous! research areas) vibrant night life and a decent economy. Its also a cosmopoliton city - people from around Europe and the world; not all UK cities are like that - London, Birmingham, Manchester and maybe Glasgow are probably the most cosmopolitan cities with other places very variable. Very nearby you also have Liverpool and Sheffield - both vibrant northern cities and nice places to live. All 3 have big university populations; in particular Manchester with it's ""twin"" city Salford has one of the biggest student populations in europe.

In terms of an area the North West of England gives you a lot of choice of big cities, and going forward there are big plans to improve rail connections and invest in the region so there may be more opportunites in the short and medium term for new residents. They want to connect Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield with high speed rail crossing the Pennines towards Leeds - it'll be a huge project of it goes ahead. There are also more advanced plans for a high speed connection from London to Birmingham to Manchestet and on to Glasgow. Bith should boost the economy somewhat.

It took a over a year of proving his worth and fending off repeated false claims of drug use for the father to get access to his son for four nights a week. The mother still tried to restrict access between them and as a result she was eventually whittled down to supervised contact after social workers reported the boy to be emotionally unsafe in her care. 

Note that when the parents first split, the father was only afforded contact in the mother's presence. There's such a clear disparity and bias here, both in the way custody is handled and in the way this abduction is being reported.

Little to no sympathy should be given to the mother in my view. She's fully aware of what she's doing and the severity of it. These articles should be emphasising the danger the child is in and urging the public to be on the lookout rather than the headlining  her reassurances of their safety along with multiple family interviews defending her character.

* At a takeaway or order-at-the-counter type place, do I tip? How much? - No need to
* How much do I tip at a sit-down-and-order restaurant? - 10% if the standard of service warrants a tip. You can tip more if the service was truly exceptional
* Pubs - how common is it to buy the barkeep a round? Can I tip or is that a no-no? - Recommend against tipping, some places will have a tips jar on the bar, so you can put something in there if you want. You can buy whoever's on the bar a drink if you want, but be subtle about it (as other's have suggested, adding ""and one for yourself"" on the end of your order is sufficient)
* If I'm eating at a family run restaurant/cafe in the country, are there any rules of etiquette I must keep in mind? - Be polite and have good manners. If you hear God Save the Queen starting, then ensure you stand
* Are there are absolutely horrific things foreigners do that I must not? (I know I mustn't cut queues). - Never, ever, under any circumstances insult the Royal Family! You would be locked in the Tower of London for all eternity!

Ok, I'm just joking on that last one. Just be conscious of others and polite. British society and has historically been really quite easy going and laid back, so long as good manners are used. Essentially, if you walk into someone you must apologise. If someone walks into you, you must apologise. ""Sorry"" is sufficient here. Finally on this point, please don't call a Pound a quid - it just doesn't sound right in any accent other than a British one (Brit's should never call a Dollar a Buck, it just doesn't sound right).

* Can I draw someone's attention by saying ""Excuse me, sir/ma'am""? Or is there a better way? - Sir/ma'am would probably be viewed as a bit old fashioned here (most people addressed as Sir would have been Knighted), just saying ""excuse me"" is often enough.

You've moved the emphasis on the falling in love to place the blame solely on women. He never said that women *make* men fall in love with them.

That's not him framing it, it's you.


It was obviously a ridiculous and ill-thought thing to say but rather than make one old man's sexist comments into a gender issue, why can't we recognise that its an individual social deficiency on the part of those who can't work around the opposite gender?

Nothing at all is needed or expected.

&gt;How much do I tip at a sit-down-and-order restaurant?

10-15% is normal. More for better service, if it's poor service then feel free not to tip them. It's a bonus not their wage. Some restuants will automatically add it - you don't have to pay it.

&gt;Pubs - how common is it to buy the barkeep a round? Can I tip or is that a no-no?

Not expected or needed but it will get you served quicker. 

&gt;If I'm eating at a family run restaurant/cafe in the country, are there any rules of etiquette I must keep in mind?

No loud shouting, swearing etc.

&gt;Are there are absolutely horrific things foreigners do that I must not? (I know I mustn't cut queues).

Americans tend to be louder - try to tone it down.

Don't do the ""I know someone called Dave in London - do you know him?"" line... it's annoying.

Remember that we might be a small country but there's a lot of cities &amp; town squished in. Don't assume you can cover it all in a week just because you could have covered that area in the US.

The thing that concerns me is Scotland Yard issued a statement that they had found 3 ""loaded and operational"" firearms in the car.
It later transpired that at least one of them was deactivated.

That doesn't affect the legality of the Police response because you often need to closely examine a gun to check if it's deactivated - so you assume it to be live.

However. Such a statement means that the CSI who collected, inspected and bagged those firearms *didn't know the difference between a loaded gun and a deactivated gun*. Or that the Police Spokesman knew the shooting was going to be of dubious legality and felt they needed to bolster their statement with embellishments (""See! Loaded operational guns! We've got some wrong 'uns here"").

Someone must have told the spokesman what they'd found, which means *either* they didn't know what they'd got, *or* the spokesman embellished the facts.

I shed no tears for Rodney, he was a wrong 'un.

But that someone ""might"" have a gun is not sufficient cause to shoot them. There needs to be imminent threat to life, and an independent enquiry has indeed found the shooting to be unlawful.

Moreover, Police making statements that later are shown in Court to be patently false (and which should have been reasonably known to be false when they were made - not errors made in good faith) really, *really* doesn't instil confidence in the force.",null,0,null,1434022907,null,0,1434023122,0,cs2wu16,null,t3_39ckmj,null,t1_cs2wu16,null,t1_cs2rnpl,null,null,null,1436905757,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;__The Protection from Harassment Act 1997__ (c 40) is an [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament) of the [Parliament of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom). On introducing the Bill's second reading in the House of Lords the then [Lord Chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor), [Lord Mackay of Clashfern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mackay_of_Clashfern) said ""The aim of this Bill is to protect the victims of [harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment). It will protect all such victims whatever the source of the harassment—so-called [stalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking) behaviour, racial harassment, or anti-social behaviour by neighbours.""  Home Office guidance on the Act  says ""The legislation was always intended to tackle stalking, but the offences were drafted to tackle any form of persistent conduct which causes another person alarm or distress.""

The public has outright condemned him, that proves we're a progressive society, why must there be more punishment? It quickly stops becoming about the issue of equality and turns into a campaign to exact revenge on those who don't have the same progressive beliefs. 

There's a growing trend that mob justice gets it's own way, anyone who offends is not only publicly humiliated but ends up fired and having [their life completely ruined](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html) by the ruthless public outrage, it absolutely should not be happening because someone ""said something you didn't like"", people who offend are now essentially treated like actual criminals. It's no wonder everyones afraid to actually speak their mind anymore.

If you go through history and look at the personal views of some of the greatest scientists, they were assholes. James Watson discovered DNA and was outright racist &amp; sexist, mob justice would've had him fired before he made that discovery.

We have a FAQ packed full of information, including a section on [budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/budgeting).

Your main mistake is not accounting for the ""one-offs"" (which are never really one-offs. They come around regularly enough that they should be included in the budget).

Your partner is contributing 25% of the household budget's fixed costs (rent+bills+food) - is this deliberate? Myself and my wife have always contributed in proportion to our relative net earnings, which always seemed the fairest way to do it. 

Your emergency fund is the right place to take this cost from - that's what it's there for. Yes, you may need to delay house purchase a little, but it's not like you thought the crowns would be free?

In the first instance, I would run through this: [MSE Budget Planner](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/Budget-planning), which forces you to consider **all** the costs you may not consider otherwise, and also shows you where costs can be painlessly and painfully reduced.

I have had a great experience with YNAB over the past six months. If you subscribe to the YNAB philosophy it becomes an effortless way of budgeting (it's basically a pre-packaged envelope budgeting system).

I am mostly referring to people's belief in what science allegedly says. It seems to me that no one knows much about what science says. Scientists themselves seem to specialise in certain subjects and know little about other stuff. Yet the hoi polloi seem to get very cocky about whatever they think it is science has told them. This leads to a general belief that things discovered using the scientific method are implicitly good or useful yet so far all it's led to is the destruction of the biosphere, i.e. 250 years of fun at the expense of the next 100,000.

BTL is the biggest problem right now. Lack of homes too, but fixing the immediate problem is easier. New builds are being sold to foreign investors, whom are just escalating the problem.

Homes should not be a business model. Right now BTL are double dipping on profits; high rents and increasing house prices. People renting from them are getting screwed over doubly.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; If the police service makes mistakes then the police service should be charged.

If you kill someone it is murder.

As defence you may make a claim of necessity - that it was necessary to kill them to prevent them killing someone else.

Who you are makes literally no difference to that.

I always remember as a cadet visiting the base Guardhouse. The RAF Policeman showed his various bits of belt kit including his sidearm.

Someone asked the obvious question ""Ever shot someone?"". He said no, and told us in no uncertain terms that if he shot someone it was murder until he showed that it was necessary to protect life or ensure base security.

This case has been through the IPCC, and the inquiry has found the shooting was unlawful (unlike the majority of Police shootings).

The officer fired, not the Police Service.

Sometimes it is in fact the individual who is guilty of misconduct and not following the training that they have received or the standards they are required to abide by. This case will examine whether that is what happened here.

If you didn't have some level of individual responsibility, Police Officers could go around beating the shit out of whoever they liked and the recourse would be ""sue the service"".

The public need to stand by the Police Service, and the Service by their Officers, but if one of them does not uphold the standards they are paid and trained to maintain, then it is right that they - individually - are held to account.

These responsibilities come with the patch - if I walked down the street with a baton for my protection, I would be arrested on Offensive Weapons charges. The mere act of possessing CS spray, a handgun, or an SMG even in my home would be a crime under Section 5 of the Firearms Act.

The Police are given special dispensation to carry all of those on the street. That dispensation comes with conditions, and it's not unreasonable that Officers who do not abide by those conditions are held to account.

&gt; We have charged someone with murder for making the wrong split second decision while acting for his country. The same charge as someone who tortures and cuts the head of a pensioner.

Which is why crimes have sentencing guidelines and scales. Someone who is found to have made a fatal error of judgement in the course of their job and who shows remorse will get a different sentence (or even get the charge knocked down to manslaughter) as compared with someone who showed sadistic delight in torturing someone to death.",null,0,null,1434027185,null,0,1434027958,0,cs2yhn2,null,t3_39ckmj,null,t1_cs2yhn2,null,t1_cs2xk2k,null,null,null,1436906768,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

ADSL, which uses an ordinary telephone line, has been practically synonymous with home broadband for several years in the UK, but it's not the only technology available.

Virgin Media is the only major ISP offering a broadband connection without a phone service, (although their prices may not always be competitive with phone+broadband bundles). They call it ""fibre optic broadband"", but it's actually a cable service - they use a [hybrid fibre-coaxial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_fibre-coaxial) system, in which users have a cable modem and/or TV set-top box connected to a coaxial cable in the street, but the coax actually only goes as far as a neighbourhood node, which is connected to Virgin's network via a fibre connection.

It's the same cable TV network they've been operating ever since they acquired NTL, but they've re-branded it in order to jump on the ""fibre"" bandwagon.

BT offers real fibre connections to homes with no copper wiring, under the BT Infinity brand (confusingly, they use the same brand for FTTC). However, as far as I understand, having a phone service is compulsory with all their packages (the [phone service works through the fibre line](http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/42641/~/connecting-your-phone-service-to-bt-infinity-%28fibre-to-the-home%29)).

Even if they don't make you have a real copper phone line, BT still lists ""line rental"" as a separate item. That doesn't really make much sense, but the ubiquitous ADSL+phone packages they're competing against are all sold using some Only £2.50/month ^^^^+£16.70 ^^^^line ^^^^rental bullshit, and BT want their fibre prices to look OK next to that on comparison sites.

We underperformed by finishing 6th. But how can anyone expect anything to improve if we continue to sign players like Bogdan as a backup and are happy with mediocrity? 

Generally we have about 40m net spend, possibly more this year due to the increase in television money. Our ability to sign another top striker solely depends on selling Balotelli, Lambert and Borini and getting their wages off the books. If we can recoup 15-20m in fees for those three that would be ideal. That would give us ~55m to spend. Another striker will most likely set us back 20-30m. I personally don't think we'll sign a DM unless either Lucas/Allen leave (though I don't agree with that either). 15m for Clyne would be expensive for a RB but given the english tax it's expected. If we sign a different RB it will definitely be cheaper than that. So if we bring in a Striker for 30m, RB for 15m, we'd have 10m for a GK.

Nobody is saying it means that, the argument is that the consequences the mob justice want are extortionate. People lose their jobs and have their lives ruined because they say something people find offensive, it's absurd. 

What we're actually doing now as a society is treating people who have a view the public don't agree with essentially as criminals in the way they're ostracised from society and lose their employment. 


&gt;However, that does not mean his employer should be forced to keep employing him if they disagree with those views.

It absolutely should though. You shouldn't be firing scientists because they have a different opinion to people, they're hired for their work in science, everything else is irrelevant.

If everyone who was an asshole got fired, very few people would be in work. Lot's of people have views the public hivemind would disagree with, what this means now is that they just keep the views to themselves for fear of sparking outrage, people are afraid to discuss certain things, that doesn't sound like a very progressive society. 

Some of the greatest scientists in history would've been fired before they completed their discoveries if this new SJW mob were around back then.

If you even looked at any recent goalkeeper transfers you would see how wrong you are but i'll list some for you anyways:

Keylor Navas to RM (2014): £7.9m

Handanovic to Inter (2012):  £8.5m

Ter Stegen to Barca (2014): £9.7m

Ospina to Arsenal (2014): £3m

Caballero to City (2014): £6m

Claudio Bravo to Barca (2014): £9.5 million

Each and every council has the right to calculate their own cost. Im sure part of that cost calculation is down to all sorts of things such as available space, quality of roads, and trying to discourage congestion.

Its not fair to assume each and every town and city has equal amounts of space and equal amounts of road problems that need solving. So its quite logical to expect costs would be different from area to area.

Edit - just saw this comment in the comments...

&gt; if these are public roads then anyone can park there.

Not so (well, I dont believe so anyway)....Parking spaces are for parking, roads are for transporting people. Its not the council's responsibility to supply people with free parking. If they do, its logical to assume we collectively are paying for their privilege.

Speaking as someone who moved to Bradford for uni and ended up staying over 15 years, it's not a bad place. In my uni years it was great for being a small friendly campus with a big bar scene and plenty of social stuff going on.

That changed massively with tuition fees coming in, and an increase in international students who (to generalise) don't tend to go out and party so much.

Then of course the recession hit, and it hit places like Bradford that weren't top of tree to start with harder than most. That along with things like the long delayed westfield shopping centre leaving a hole in the city centre made the place feel a bit forgotten and unloved.

The shopping centre opens in november, there's a new bar scene being to flourish with places like The Sparrow and Bradford Brewery opening...and generally there's a feel that things could be about to turn a corner.

Bradford will always be a few steps behind Leeds. Which always gets the investment first, and is close enough by that its an obvious alternative for shopping and going out.

Bradford is a patchwork city, nice parts next to dodgy ones and it's always been that way, crime is higher than it should be but (touch wood) in fifteen years i've never been a victim of it.

Harm was caused *before* the kidnapping. The harm was what convinced the judge to grant full custody to the father, which resulted in the kidnapping. 

&gt; My point here is that the claim he was being sexually abused should not be ignored because they couldn't find evidence of it

So what should be done? Should the father be denied access to the child just based on an accusation? Remember, that custody was only granted to the father because the court found the mother to be causing emotional harm to the child. Are you OK with that? What would you do?

Given that we know: mother found to have inflicted emotional harm + no evidence of harm (physical, sexual or emotional) from father + mother kidnapped child, I'm inclined to side with the father. Of course, it might turn out to be a different situation, but it's irrelevant to speculate without evidence.

I really think it's helped me developed personally. I used to be pessimistic and wary of many things and I enjoy things more now, without always being concerned with planning everything. I don't spend much on cars, electronics, etc. and save much, but travelling has been an amazing enriching experiment for me. 

I also think that there is a 3rd alternative to:

- spend everything and get 20k credit card debt 
- spend nothing, live frugally and retire 40 with £1mln on the bank

It's a great accomplishment, but at 40 you have other priorities, responsibilities and want other things in life than 8 months backpacking, which [this man](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/funds/11484747/Im-28-with-50000-savings.-How-long-before-I-can-afford-to-quit-work-and-travel-the-world.html) didn't understand either it seems.

So far financially hasn't been bad for me growing from £30k yearly to £500 daily. I think that my youth is more important than saving the maximum amount of money on such money. 

I would definitely recommend going out there, 8 months in a bit long maybe if you're going for a first time. But travelling is a great way to spend your life.

Shop smart. Don't buy ready prepared meals as they are always more expensive than cooking your own - however, don't put off buying discount pizza etc if you see it. Just don't spend more than you really have to. All the meat I buy tends to be lesser known (cheaper) cuts that I can still make something tasty from....

Everything in that is designed to give this industry over to Big Pharma and wipe out the small players.

I am not advocating a strict 50/50 split in living expenses if there is big disparity of income - but contributing 450 pounds per month and having everything covered does not seem to be fine to me. What does he/she do that allows for contributing some but only that little? 

Side note: you need to account for the unexpected expenses - to be honest they are expected its their timing that its unexpected they need to be budget for. I realised that almost every month I have something in the category of one-offs. Its a totally different expense every time and its always one that you pay only once, but they are consistently there - and I am certain that there will be more over the next few months.

All in all you should be fine, Cambridge while expensive is cheaper than London and living with a partner is cheaper per person than alone.

/r/fatpeoplehate went too far. But I found some of the titles funny. Shame on me for laughing at fat people falling over but it's funny. I watch it every night on ""You've been Framed"" whats wrong with looking at a subreddit dedicated to it?

Either way the main concern now is reddit admins having a fucking backbone and actually going through with what they said. Currently all they have done is ban /r/fatpeoplehate and the 50 odd subs that spawned becuase of it being banned. However, Racist content, Nude Babies, Dead People, Dead Babies, Abortions Etc all still continue to be posted without a hitch after multiple hundreds of reports to the new reddit system.

Also I like Lucas, I was fired up and don't even know how poor Lucas ended up in the cross fire.  I'm sorry Lucas, I hope you stay too.  

Second.  The reason I think Bogdan is a good choice is for a few reasons.  The primary one is that I don't think LFC will spend over 20 million this window.  I think after the RB situation is solved that will be it for the most part.  Maybe some signings here and there for the youth team and academy but nothing major.  So I saw value in the free signing because if LFC are, in my opinion, not going to spend a lot of money than back up GK is where I would mind them getting it on a free.


Are there better players than Bogdan available for less than 10 mil?  Yes, of course.  But I doubt very much that any will want to come and be a back up for the wages LFC are likely to offer.  He IS an upgrade on Jones and that might not be good enough for you but I feel like he is good enough for me as a back up.  I understand that you think they should get an even better backup GK and I get it.  It isn't a crazy notion, but in my head, with the circumstances I believe the club are in it made sense to me.

null,false,fuckin442m8,null,null,null,"&gt;Harm was caused before the kidnapping. The harm was what convinced the judge to grant full custody to the father, which resulted in the kidnapping.


The reason full custody was given to the father was because the mother took the son to the hospital because she claimed he had been sexually assaulted by the father, no evidence of sexual assault was found so the mothers actions were deemed harmful to the child.

All I'm saying here is that the hospital not finding evidence of sexual assault doesn't mean it didn't happen. 

I'm saying that the claim should be fully investigated with child psychologists coming in to interview the child and look for signs of sexual assault.

&gt;So what should be done? Should the father be denied access to the child just based on an accusation? 

No, but the claim should be extremely thoroughly investigated, which due to previous cases involving child sex abuse, I find it hard to trust the thoroughness of our judicial system. 


&gt;Remember, that custody was only granted to the father because the court found the mother to be causing emotional harm to the child. Are you OK with that? What would you do?

Yeah, because she took the son to hospital claiming he had been sexually abused, how do you know that isn't true? Just because they found no evidence of it? That isn't proof. 

&gt;Given that we know: mother found to have inflicted emotional harm + no evidence of harm (physical, sexual or emotional) from father + mother kidnapped child, I'm inclined to side with the father. Of course, it might turn out to be a different situation, but it's irrelevant to speculate without evidence.

According to a bolton fan 

&gt;  The most concerning misconception is in regards to how far up Adam Bogdan is on the Bolton Wanderers' goalkeeper pecking order. Let me assure you, he's firmly at the top. The only reason he made so few appearances last year was due to him being unlucky with two fairly serious injuries. Don't threat, not the niggly reoccurring kind, well at least I hope not. Yes, the only reason it appears that Andy Lonergan and then Ben Amos were chosen ahead of him is because early on in the season he suffered a broken finger, which saw him side-lined until late on in 2014. Then, in near on the immediate after math of his outstanding performance at Anfield, he twisted awkwardly in training and suffered ankle ligament damage. Upon his return, he was benched for two games until the in-form Amos returned to Manchester United, and then he continued his fine performances between the sticks until the season came to its conclusion. Our other goalkeeper, Lonergan, was released this summer with no effort to keep him at the club, unlike with Bogdan.",null,0,null,1434032494,null,0,false,0,cs318ll,null,t3_39aleg,null,t1_cs318ll,null,t1_cs30p1b,null,null,null,1436908297,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

You should, because you keep saying dumb things and don't even realise how dumb they are.

&gt;The reason I called you a loony fucking idiot has fuck all to do with your gender and everything to do with your agenda/victim complex.

The reason you called me a loony fucking idiot is because you're not a nice person, and you lack the ability to argue in an intelligent way, so you decided to throw a toddler paddy instead.

&gt;You would obviously think it's all because of gender because you can't see things any other way

You would obviously choose to pretend it's not about gender because you are so unempathetic that even when it's SO obvious that this is an issue with a sexist misogynist dinosaur making horribly sexist comments, you try and mansplain them away and insist there's no gender issue with a nobel prize winner telling **girls** they shouldn't be in his lab.

You are charging yourself to clean the house you live in purely for the purposes of on paper having 16hrs to claim tax credits. Under HMRC tax laws as you are using the house for personal use you cannot legally claim any expenses for any materials used to clean it as a tax deductible expense in your business which should tell you all you need to know about the legitimacy of what you're doing.

Whats worse is that if you probably worked out how many hours you actually spend on the business and include everything business related you do such as the time taken to do the books, you probably do 16hrs anyway.

&gt; It seems to me that we would just be arranging our affairs in a tax efficient manner

Except you're not. You're doing it for the sole purposes of qualifying for a social security benefit you are not entitled to. It is absolutely nothing like the examples you've given. In those cases you merely pay less in. In your case HMRC would award and pay you £1000s. 

The fact you can't even see that this is wrong really saddens me. The fact a moderator of this forum cannot see it is blatant benefit fraud is even sadder.

Did you read the sources? Or do you feel you can speak on the issue and recommend things before doing that?

&gt; At that hearing there were further issues of fact as a result of allegations made by the mother against the father, all of which the District Judge rejected and, in relation to which the District Judge found that the allegations had been fabricated by the mother to frustrate contact.

From the linked sources. Further:

&gt; Reports were ordered from the Local Authority under section 37 of The Children Act 1989; orders under that section are made where a court is so concerned about a child that it requires a Local Authority to report as to whether a care or supervision order might be appropriate in relation to the child. Further the very eminent child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr Berelowitz was instructed to report. By that stage Ethan himself had been joined as a party to the proceedings on the basis that his interests within the proceedings would be promoted by a guardian; this is a step that is taken in particularly complex private law cases to ensure that the court has sufficient information about the welfare of the child. Thus the court had the benefit of a wide spectrum of professional opinion – the Local Authority Children’s services (‘social services’), the guardian and Dr Berelowitz.

and

&gt; The author of the report that the Local Authority filed under section 37 of The Children Act 1989, a social worker, did not recommend the commencement of care or supervision proceedings. However she did take the view that Ethan is not emotionally safe with the mother and that he should live with his father on the basis that the mother would have only supervised contact.

and

&gt; Dr Berelowitz observed a warm relationship between Ethan and both of his parents. He reported that the mother did not accept that the father was innocent of the allegations that had been made against him; he considered that the mother had questioned Ethan extensively. He recommended that Ethan should live with his father and that the mother’s contact would have to be supervised.

and

&gt; The guardian, Tara Bolton, also gave evidence before the District Judge and her recommendations mirrored those of Dr Berelowitz.

What more ""investigations"" do you want? I agree it is a serious issue, but we have *three* different skilled and qualified sources telling us (1) father is OK and (2) mother is not. How many reports do you want? 5? 7? 

Of course, the court does recognise the view you are putting forward:

&gt; A hearing was listed before the District Judge on 27th May 2015. On 25th May 2015 the mother took Ethan to a hospital, making further allegations against the father of abusive behaviour towards Ethan; medical staff did not find anything that substantiated the allegations, although that *of itself* could not be conclusive about the allegations that the mother made. However, the mother then took the stance that the father should only have supervised contact with Ethan.

And yet with that in mind:

&gt; The final hearing on Wednesday 27th May was listed for two days. It was the third hearing which considered allegations that had been made by the mother against the father. At that hearing the District Judge intended to deal with the allegations that the mother had raised against the father of sexual misconduct arising from the 25th May ... The judge rejected the allegations ... The Judge made a positive finding that Ethan had been exposed to emotional harm by the mother and also found, inevitably, that the mother had acted in breach of two court orders.

So *maybe* this father has fooled CPS, psychologists, the kids guardian and the courts. But I do not think taking that stance is in fact neutral. Unless we want to sit and shout at every court case accusations of corruption, we should have some trust in the judicial process (unless you can point to some conflict of interest here?) and say it is most likely that the father is innocent here.

Untrue though.

1. Between Kane, Bentaleb, Pritchard, Dele Alli, Dier and Tom Carroll, our youth prospects are amongst the brightest in the Premier League.

2. The fact we've finished fifth this season, in what was probably one of the most competitive seasons within the last twenty years, is a tremendous outcome.

3. Our team quality is the most balanced it's ever been, our XI is really strong

               Lloris
        Walker Dier Vert Rose
            Mason Bentaleb

        Vlad Fazio Wimmer Davies
            Stambouli Paulinho
        Townsend Dembele Chadli

&gt;for which no evidence had been found by medical professionals

Once again, I'm found repeating myself, sexual assault does not always leave physical evidence, how do you know that they didn't just check for physical signs of abuse? (which is what they usually do).

&gt;And, unfortunate as it may be, our court system works based around evidence. If you don't have any, your claims are worth shit.

Yeah and yet when you're presented with the horrific cases of sex abuse over the years, the numerous stories coming out every week about institutionalised abuse, you'll scratch your head and ask ""how is this happening?"". 

Sexual assault does not always leave evidence, every claim should be thoroughly investigated, that doesn't just mean doctors looking for physical signs (which is what happens in most cases) it also means child psychologists and the like investigating the childs behaviour.

The fact is most of the historic sex abuse cases happened for years because people dismissed them due to lack of evidence.

Fair point about Reina/Doni/Jones but now it makes sense to me why they got rid of Reina - saving about 3m a year having Mignolet instead. If you think about it actually, Mignolet's transfer fee is basically covered by the wages we've saved + Reina's transfer fee. Anyway I don't think they'll go down that route again in order to save money, although the cost wouldn't be as high since none of them would be earning 100k/wk.

And as for Allen, yeah we could do with clearing him off the wage bill and generating a few million from him before signing a DM.

Yeah but if your house has gone up then so has your equity improving your buying power in line with the price rises of other houses. So yes there's no benefit as such but compare that to the scenario where you don't own a house and the prices of bigger houses have gone up anyway which puts you at a disadvantage. You're no better off but importantly you're not worse off!

You can also benefit from it in a different way. When you take out a mortgage the Loan to value ratio has a large impact on the interest rate you'll be offered. Loan to value is the difference between how much the house is worth vs how much outstanding debt you have on the house. If your house value goes up by 25% then your LTV ratio also goes up which means you can get a better interest rate and pay off your mortgage quicker!

An (contrived) example: Your house is currently worth £100K you put in a deposit of £10K so your LTV is 90% which means banks give you an interest rate of 5% over 20 years. 

Now if the value goes up by 25% you now ~~own~~ owe £90k on a £125K house Thats a LTV of 72%! With that your bank is much more confident it can recoup their costs if you default so they offer you a lower rate of 3% over 20 years.

that 2% difference in mortgage rate adds up very quickly in the first year it's £2000 or £166 a month less interest you're paying.",null,0,null,1434034502,null,0,1434113287,0,cs32ha0,null,t3_39fbxt,null,t1_cs32ha0,null,t1_cs2z8ex,null,null,null,1436909366,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

- Resistance and energy loss

- Electric motors

- Transformers

- Nuclear fission

- Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden Experiment

- Static Electricity

- Friction

She doesn't need to be locked up, but her unstable behaviour needs to be considered when the courts assess the level of access she should have with her child.

She should also be punished for skipping her court date and evading prosecution, perhaps monetarily and with a suspended sentence.

Who is to say that she won't kill herself and the child rather than give him up? Who's to say that she won't kidnap him again? 

At the least she needs rehabilitation as she is clearly a danger to herself and her child. That should probably come in the form of counselling and regulated access to her child.

Probability of **at least** one blue was 48/90. The only combination that would *not* get you at least one blue (the combination that wouldn't get you *any* blues) was red and red. This mean that red, red was equal to 1 - 48/90. Therefore, red, red was equal to 42/90. Then you did (n/10) x ((n-1)/9) (n being the number of red counters). 

You have n/10 as there are an unknown amount of reds among the 10 counters and then it decreases to n-1/9 as the amount of reds decrease by 1 when selecting 1 red counter, and so the total counters decrease by 1 to get you 9.

As such, (n/10) x ((n-1)/9) would get you (n^2 - n)/90. This is equal to 42/90 (the probability of red counters). Now you have (n^2 - n)/90 = 42/90. Take out the ""/90"" part and you get n^2 - n = 42. With a bit of guessing, n = 7 therefore there are 7 red counters.

He had to play out of position in the 3 at the back formation  as did others. But otherwise he played here he is comfortable.

I think the issue is that he didn't play enough. He looked poor at the begining of the season. But then after he settled a little he looked a pretty decent player with a lot of potential. With interestingly a lot of his better games coming from wingback such as the game v Sunderland. But the issue is that he didn't play enough.

Anyway I think the talk of letting him leave isn't because the manager isn't impressed with him but because Markovic hasn't settled in and is perhaps homesick.

Yes, the solution is to fix the housing market. Interestingly, and I know that it is a terrible back of a fag packet type calculation, but if it cost on average, say £50k to build a house, the government could build 320,000 by spending £16bn. Roughly the amount of the  housing benefit bill. Why not do that for a few years?

Then, all that money would go into creating jobs, paying for materials etc etc. There would be positive knock on effects for the economy. Also, more houses would be built, lowering house prices and rental costs, thus lowering the housing benefit bill at the same time. 

The government wouldn't even have to spend all that money on council house type things - it could be used in part for grants or loans to individuals or whatever.

There are plenty of managers out there who have had some exceptionally stunning seasons in an otherwise fairly middling/inconsistent career - Hodgson, AVB, Moyes, Redknapp, and possibly could add Rodgers as well. People are happy to call Klopp world-class because of two or three good seasons at Dortmund and the handful of trophies he won there, but ignore the fact that the rest of his managerial career has been thoroughly average. 

If he's such a great manager, what happened to Dortmund this season? What happened to Mainz when he got them relegated? What stops those same issues being repeated at Liverpool? How is he any different to a striker who had one 25 goal season and a ton of hype without being able to consistently repeat it?

-------------------------------------

I am writing to express my concern about the Snoopers' Charter having returned to the forefront of Government agenda in the recently-announced Investigatory Powers Bill.

Unchecked surveillance harms democracy, prevents journalists being able to do their jobs and destroys privacy of us all.

Nothing to hide is a failed argument, just look at the way GHCQ/NSA have been know spied on charities and lawyers of families suing the UK government.

In the UK's recent history the security services have covered up state murder and child abuse - e.g : 

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/15/mi5-kincora-childrens-home-northwen-ireland-sexual-abuse.

Just because GHCQ helped to defeat Nazism doesn't mean that the public should just trust the organisation with unchecked surveillance, they presently have the power to potentially swing an election, in a good democracy they would not have.

AFAIK, the EU doesn't mandate this, that is entirely our own political decision. The really ridiculous way we treat non-EU migrants is pretty much entirely because we don't have any power to completely rework the EU labour market. That is entirely Britain's fault. The honest thing to do is to admit that immigration *is* a good thing, letting people with skills and a good education work here is a good thing, letting people who are married to British citizens come here is a good thing (there's a ridiculous thing now where the Home Office is turning away people married to Brits while pretty much anybody married to a non-EU citizen [or a Brit who has established residency elsewhere in the EU and is coming to the UK] can get through no problem) and our economy will gain skills and be more dynamic for it.

&gt;  Workers are expected to go where the work is, and it's championed as one of its strengths... I wonder how many of the kids coming over in a diaspora from Spain and Portugal would much rather have jobs in their own country, but can't because the work is elsewhere.

Well, duh. But letting them just fester in their own country, unemployed and left to rot, isn't the answer. That gets you a breakdown of social order and a move from the political centre to radical parties.

&gt; . In many ways the UK is really lucky - we're ""where the work is"", but it might not always be that way. I'd be horrified to think I, or my children might have to go and work in Portgual one day, just because there is no work in the UK. It's one thing to be expected to move from Plymouth to Nottingham for work. It's another thing to be expected to go from Plymouth to Krakow.

Better Krakow, surely, than Toronto, or Auckland, or Sydney, or Cape Town, which is precisely where British migrants went at the turn of the last century, the 1920s, the 1950s...hell, today, really. Where ya think many of them white folks in Canada/Oz/NZ/SA came from?

From a holiday point of view - I suggest you think hard about why you want to go for 8 months. I know plenty of people who went travelling at about your age - and all of them said that they went for longer than they needed to. A friend of mine spent his gap year trying to 'discover himself' while travelling - he ended up discovering he already knew who he was, but now he was poorer.

Leaving yourself wanting more, is not a bad thing! 

A couple of other tips:
* Buy a flexible return ticket - these are generally more expensive, but will allow you to adjust your return flight much more easily. A flexible return ticket is often still cheaper than flying on two one-way tickets.
* Don't rule out a slightly more expensive airline. For example - it might be slightly more expensive to fly British Airways, but they'll be more forgiving if your plans change, and the airmiles you earn on a long haul trip like that can be traded in for a lot of stuff - you don't need many airmiles to fly for almost nothing in Europe (other airlines are available!)
* Expect to get bored/homesick/lonely - It doesn't matter how independant you are  and how many times you've done it before, or how set you are on it - if you are travelling in an unfamiliar place for that long alone, you'll begin to feel it.
* Expect to get ill - travelling can be stressful and tiring, and you'll be eating unfamiliar food.

Not that any of this should matter. The Islands want continuation of the status quo so anyone else trying to impose their will on them is frankly just being a fucking fascist. Argentina's argument that they are all settlers and therefore have no right to self-determination is hilariously audacious. Argentinians are themselves not native to South America and they continued their genocidal expansion into native lands for decades after the Falklands were re-occupied by Britain. According to Argentina Falkland Islanders = Settlers and Patagonians = Rightful owners of the land even though the Falklanders have been there much longer. 

It is disgusting that Argentina actually has the audacity to scream victimhood and imperialism. It is ridiculous that Argentina wants to go back to 1830s borders and hypocritical that they won't apply that to anywhere else besides the Falklands. Nobody would claim that Poles in Prussia have no right to self determination, or Russians in Siberia, or Japanese in Hokkaido, or white people basically anywhere in the New World.

Ehh... You're not really making a solid point here, considering you've taken a small selection of games (less than 33% of the games Guzan played this season). For comparison, I could look at the ten games from November to January and say he conceded only six in ten games (over Christmas, no less!) and talk him up. It's not really honest though, is it?

Taken as a whole, the stats seem to suggest that Guzan is... roughly average, actually.

Check it. A comparison with PL keepers 2014/15 who have played at least 20 games (a crude measure to identify ""starting"" keepers; there are 19 of them, for the record) according to Squawka.

**Goals Conceded:** Guzan ranks 4th highest.   
Pretty condemning, right? But it would be silly to place the blame for all of these goals on him. It's a start though. And so far, yeah, maybe you have a point.

**Clean Sheets:** Guzan ranks 10th, with 9 in 34 games    
Literally smack bang in the middle. When juxtaposed with the previous stat, we get the suggestion that it's perhaps a fair assessment that we don't ascribe all the blame (or even most of it) for that high tally on Guzan. For comparison, Hugo Lloris -- widely considered to be among the league's best goalkeepers -- played almost the exact same number of minutes (3060 for Guzan, 3063 for Lloris) conceded the same number of goals, and kept one fewer clean sheet.  

**Distribution:** Guzan ranks 8th, 60% overall completion.    
Let's break this one down a bit. There are several different categories here. Guzan ranks as follows:    
* 17th for thrown out (95% completion)    
* 9th for goal kicks (52% completion)    
* 4th on kicks from hands (37% completion)    
* 8th on other distribution (58% completion)    
Overall, pretty average. Ignoring his thrown passes, he's actually significantly above average in terms of completion rate, and I would have said distribution was his weakest point before seeing the stats. Interesting, no? Also of note was that his average pass completion distance was among the shortest in the league (17th, just 38m) though it's not clear what that signifies, given that the two keepers with shorter average distances are Courtois and Mignolet. Does perhaps put a tint on the pass completion stat, though. Makes sense he'd rank decent if he's making shorter passes on average. Would be better if I had a breakdown of completion rate by pass distance perhaps... but we make do with what we have.

**Saves Made:** Guzan ranks 8th with 83    
Sheer numbers-wise... that's decent. Fabianski finished first with 126 saves, and McGregor was bottom with 54 so 83 isn't far off where you'd expect the middle to be. Let's break this down, though. Not all saves are equal, are they?    
* Diving saves, 11th with 37    
Why is this important? Well, less diving saves would suggest superior positioning. Less than half of Guzan's saves required him to dive. Notable.    
* Other saves (i.e. not diving, not with feet), 2nd with 44    
Again, this implies solid positioning. If he didn't dive, and didn't use his feet, it means he had to be directly in the shot lane, positioned to use his hands. Only one keeper in the league made more saves of this type, and only one other made more of this type than diving/feet combined. Major plus point for Guzan in terms of positioning, I think. Aside from that, it's hard to use these numbers meaningfully though. You could make the case that more saves in the ""other"" category denotes good reflexes, but we don't know the distance from goal for each of those shots. Also, a goalkeeper who faces more shots will inevitably make more saves on average... I don't see a save percentage metric though, so I can't reliably provide that. The only reliable conclusion I can draw is that these figures suggest good positioning.

**Claims:** Guzan ranks 6th with 103.    
Solid. Not really much more to say here. Suggests a good command of his area to average three claims per game, with only six failures all season. His total attempts (109) ranks 4th.   
However, six puts him 3rd for failed claim attempts. This is somewhat expected (more attempts means more likely to fail) but when you consider that Courtois has the same number of claims and no failures... you realise that those six failures perhaps correlate to mistakes that might lead to goals (or at least chances). This is perhaps underlined by the fact that Guzan's 94% 94% success rate on claiming balls into the area ranks 17th. Overall it seems to suggest that Guzan is generally good when claiming balls into the box, but that he does misjudge a little more often than most. I'll speak more on that possibility in a second...

**Punches:** Guzan ranks 7th with 16.
Okay, it's sort of hard to interpret this one. In a way, you could consider it to be a measure of confidence (in himself and his defenders, since punches don't often go far; Mignolet, Fabianski and Hart all average noticeably more punches than other keepers and have pretty solid defences in front of them) or a sign of poor judgement when coming to claim crosses (can't catch it, so I'll punch; perhaps more likely with Guzan, given the comparatively low claim success rate). I won't read too much into it as a result, though, because we can't draw meaningful conclusions without more data. Either way, though, Guzan falls roughly in the middle (the mean is 16.47, median is 13). Fair to call that average, I think. I'll also take the view that he'd have less punches if he were better at judging aerial balls in the box perhaps, based on his relatively high claim failure rate.

**TL;DR version:** In summary, the stats point to Guzan being average to a little above average overall for a starting goalkeeper in the Premier League, based on key points of shot-stopping, distribution, command of the area and positioning. It is also implied that positioning is perhaps Guzan's strongest attribute, given his relatively low number of diving saves as a percentage, and high volume of successful claims.",null,0,null,1434037417,null,0,false,0,cs34fo6,null,t3_39emts,null,t1_cs34fo6,null,t1_cs2vhi5,null,null,null,1436910727,null,9,false,avfc,t5_2s569,9,null

His instinct is to be more attack-minded because of his qualities there.

I think if we bring in another box to box midfielder who can play alongside him then he'll be able to show all of his qualities more effectively -- in his first season, Yaya and him would sort of rotate going forward and that helped significantly. For the most part, Yaya simply shirked his defensive duties this year and left the entire midfield to Fernandinho which was often too much (as it would be for most anyone).

Specifically, they say that women have a ""slightly"" higher success rate (50% vs 63% in sole residence cases), which is discounted as being because they tend to have custody already and courts want to avoid disruption to the child. The conclusion reads:

&gt; Our research found that the success rate for mothers and fathers in applications for orders to have their children live with them was similar within our sample.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Mothers and fathers sought the residence orders for different reasons. There was a clear correlation between the presence of very serious child welfare concerns, local authority involvement and applications by fathers for residence. While transfers of sole residence were rare as the courts as the courts sought to preserve status quo where transfers were ordered they were disproportionately likely to be transfers from mum to dad and to feature welfare concerns and children’s services involvement.

This is best understood in the context of sections 4.4.4 and 4.5.2.1, which tell us these concerns are overwhelmingly supported and make up the majority of cases where residence was transferred. This is the exact phenomenon being discussed: men are bringing cases in more extreme situations where you'd expect them to win. That success rates overall are ""similar"" despite this could itself indicate a bias: in the same way you might expect more women to win because they're the incumbent carers, you might expect more men to win because their cases are more likely to involve serious concerns about the other parent, but the paper only takes one of these two things into account for its headline conclusion.",null,0,null,1434038506,null,0,1434038775,0,cs356ef,null,t3_39f7ci,null,t1_cs356ef,null,t1_cs2w9u3,null,null,null,1436911317,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,null,"&gt;I have heard they have increased their bid for a current French international and remain hopeful they will clinch his signature.

This could be either Gignac or Remy. ""Bid"" makes me think Remy, as Gignac would just be a wage offer. Still, could be either.

&gt;I also believe that the Club are considering a multi-million pound offer for an African international who has the potential to go on and become one of the best players in Europe.

This one piques my interest because everyone was assuming he meant Ayew when he mentioned it yesterday. Now that we know that isn't the case, I would say either Alex Song (who we ""haven't given up on"") or possibly Senegal's Idrissa Gueye. I'd love Gueye and he makes more sense in this context because Song is already pretty well established.

&gt;There have been reports linking West Ham with a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Yohan Cabaye and my sources indicate to me that although the Club really like him, they are not convinced that PSG will be willing to sell him this summer.

Could be a smokescreen due to the rumors PSG has been offering him to clubs. Could be that those rumors were falsely created/exaggerated after Cabaye had a down year last year, too.

&gt;West Ham have also been linked with moves for Olcay Sahan and Burak Yilmaz in the last 24 hours but my understanding is that the Club are not making moves for the duo.

Not surprising. Felt like journo speculation more than anything. Gotta get clicks, right?

&gt;With Slaven Bilic arriving at the Boleyn Ground this week, there has been rumours surrounding who will be appointed to his backroom staff.

Keep hearing that there will be a few ""West Ham Legends"" on the staff. Specifically, I have heard Steve Potts will get a promotion and take over for Macca as lead assistant.

Sticking him LB is what he needed. Ya Johnson isn't exactly a popular figure but when we were calling out for a system change it wouldn't have been the end of the world to put him back in at RB in a back 4. Is Moreno, Sakho, Skrtel and Johnson really that bad as a unit? I don't think so. 

Fair point about Can, but Allen was inconsistent so I see no reason that he had to play over Can in CM if we switched to a back 4 again. Can, Hendo and Gerrard would have been a solid trio at the back end of the year in my opinion, especially if you had Gerrard more advanced because he was our most natural goal scorer in the side for most of the run in and could have helped add a few more goals, while Hendo and Can looked after some of the more defensive duties. 

Rotate the front 3 then with Sterling, Lallana, Ibe, Marko, Borini, Lambert and Balo. I don't think Lallana played that well that he definitely deserved to start. Same with Sterling really. Ya Ibe was great but he's a kid so doesn't have to play every game, and we clearly had nothing to play for I don't see why we couldn't test out the likes of Can, Marko, Moreno and Manquillo in their natural spots to prepare for next year. If the style and selections we used in the last few games is a sign of next season then I'm very concerned.

Whatever a valuer tells a family their home is _actually_ worth (and often these are just figures relative to current market prices on similar houses), a purchaser will often consider the _real_ value to be what they paid and not a penny less (or rather not much less, sometimes what they need to pay off their debt).  Whilst that's perhaps illogical, it's not _so_ crazy in a country where the housing market has always slumped and then recovered and gone higher (perhaps partly because it's a rigged market, but nonetheless true).  It's just a waiting game.

If you think about it, it's similar in the stock market.  People who rush in and out in bull runs and panics get seriously burned.  People who play the waiting game tend to win over long periods, particularly where they are invested broadly in indices and baskets as obviously many individual companies do go to the wall and never recover their value.  The problem for most people is that they need their money now or soon or sometime, and they don't have long enough horizons, they can't afford to lose in the short term to win in the longer term, and they're not solvent enough.  So they get driven out of the market, crystalise their losses and making thunking great big ones.

The Hull ferry is overnight and Rotterdam port is the middle of nowhere, but harwich to hoek van Holland is about half an hour's drive from the Hague.

&gt;The recent redevelopment of London’s Haggerston estate in Hackney — now called City Mills — and Packington estate in Islington are “fantastic examples of how these concrete blocks can be torn down and replaced with streets”, he said.

The report says:

&gt; Mothers and fathers sought the residence orders for different reasons. 

There is no way those two statements could be more contradictory.

&gt; mothers primary applied for sole residence (ie the bit relevant to what you are saying about similar success rates) to retain their position as carer and fathers mainly applied to become career, this is laid out in sections 2.8.1 and 2.8.5

&gt; they were more likely to involve child welfare concerns and local authority involvement which makes when considering that mothers generally apply to retain their position (social services are less interested if a child is already not living with a parent that would cause them harm)

Yes, you're now saying that there are differences, where as before you were saying that there weren't. You are an abnormally bad liar. The problem is that only one difference was taken into account for the headline conclusion: the difference that makes 63% vs 50% ""equal"".

If i had the choice would i not owe 30k? Sure, but i didn't have a choice. As nice as it is to lament simpler times its not going to change the fact that a degree is required, especially for what i work in. Can't really equate it to 30 years ago because my job simply didnt exist.

As far as the productive citizen angle is concerned its definitely not as bad as people make out. Regardless of tax, NI etc for every £1 i make over £21,000 i keep 91 pence of it. This seems like a decently reasonable tradeoff as weighing up having my degree enables me to get a job so i can earn X - SL. Without the degree, sure i wouldnt have to pay it but my projected earnings would be far lower.

Also the debt does eventually get wiped off and if i was to find myself unemployed tomorrow i just don't pay it, im not going to get bailiffs coming to my house and taking my TV or car.

But some areas are great too. Let's not forget that. And there is a lot of redevelopment in there though I find redevelopment only occurs in some of the worst areas.

Bradford has a great history of underselling itself and the long term locals hate the place but sometimes they don't see the wood for the trees.

The number of people who go to university is not more than 40% and may be as low as 27% currently depending on the methodology you use:

http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/jun/04/higher-education-participation-data-analysis

Furthermore, in the 80s and 90s there were polytechnics but in 1992 they merged with the universities system which results in the largest single bump in the number of people participating in the higher education system but numbers on the awards from the polytechnices are hard to come by. Roughly speaking it looks like they account for about 13% of the current degrees awarded looking at this and simply subtracting the last year before they were counted from the first year they were:

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/social-trends-rd/social-trends/social-trends-41/education-and-training.pdf

To put it another way, it's not a million miles from 1/8 doing a degree as you say and 1/8 doing a polytechnic qualification so 25% of people engaging in some form of education after school - that's not a million miles from the max 40% we have now.

I know people will think that sounds like nonsense because it seems to be so improbable against the rise in student numbers but there's a few other things that affect this. The UK share of international students has grown massively in this time (they are now 1/3 of students in UK HEI) and the population has increased dramatically as well.

Another way of looking at this is looking at this though is in terms of expenditure on training and higher education:

http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/22738/1/SN02631.pdf

What you can see there is that the total UK expenditure on education has been growing very slowly with a spike in 2008 (that's because of the recession's affect on GDP though I think).

Finally, the other element of these numbers though is the number of jobs that require a degree. The number of jobs that demand a degree has grown from 10% in the mid 1980s to about 26% now. Meanwhile, at the same time, the number of jobs with no requirement for a degree have been in decline for years: 

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22268809

So basically, the number of UK young adults getting *some form of training after leaving school* has increased slightly, the number of jobs requiring a degree has *increased by 150%*, the amount the country spends as a percentage of GDP on this education has grown slightly and the cost to the individual students has increased from nothing to £36,000 for a 3 year degree.",null,0,null,1434044625,null,0,1434045010,0,cs39kr0,null,t3_39fveu,null,t1_cs39kr0,null,t1_cs32ai9,null,null,null,1436914642,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Due to my area being rural we still have a big powerful lobby group within that sector.  Made a point about reaching out to the farmers who are unhappy with the Tories and was told they had a self interest in keeping some things the same.  This is the same group who voted in favour of blocking strikes from farm workers but decided to strike and block some main roads around diary distribution centres in the local area when things did not go their way. Tory party have strong support from them even if they have lost so much.  Tories removed a series of safe guards in the name of the free market which impacted the farmers. 
I was aware of a small group of self interested farmers who gain loads of subsidies from the EU. Around £1 million goes between something like 10 farmers every year.  Say farmers been told small number are just land owners.   

One of the points made was we should expand to other groups but should not place all hopes on the farmers.  Something which I agree with but still worth reaching out to this group after all most UKIP voters are apathetic who turned out to vote.  SNP showed the power of apathetic voters even in safe seats.  

When it came to the meeting one or two most was disappointed with the current state of the party.  Mainly the format money not coming to local CLP. Hints about voting reform.  Also was told that was somebody else around my age and put in touch with him signed up on a mailing list.  Was also given the name of somebody who is quite a socialist.

Then the 1980s suffered huge unemployment when we had to cut off subsidies to all the unprofitable state-owned industries. In the 1990s, the economic decision to try to join the precursor to the Euro led to interest rates that actually hit 15% at their worst. Oh, and throughout the entire period, you had shit food, terrible housing quality, and awful service from state enterprises - it took months to get a new phone installed, for instance. The unemployment rate is currently a touch over 5%, real incomes are far higher, and anyone can get a student loan for living costs and tuition fees that they only have to pay back if they get a good job.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"Did you watch us play with wingbacks, not just watch but did you observe them closely? I feel that there's some stupid stereotype surrounding that position. The wingbacks were at winger's position all the time when we attacked and weren't forced forced to do that much defensive work. If Rodgers hadn't given him a chance at wingback he might have sat out most of the matches as he wasn't good enough to budge Coutinho, Lallana or Sterling (or Ibe) from their positions - they were much more decisive and productive with their play. The only chance for him to get semi-regular game time was at wide midfield. What would've been worse, him not getting any gametime at all or him getting very decent run of games at either right/left wingback? 

He had some very good games there, he made himself undroppable for a period of time. Why wasn't he played in position of Coutinho, Lallana or Sterling? Apart from the fact that they are currently better than him, Lazar can't turn with the ball. His playing style requires him to have space in front of him. Until he gets comfortable with playing to his back to goal and turning with the ball under pressure we can't use him in those positions. It's clear as day.

If you want some indication how wingback's and winger's position differ in position then I'll give you an example or two. 

First game - Everton at home. Markovic started as a right winger. His average position? http://www.liverpoolfc.com/fixtures2014/first-team/liverpool-v-everton-8268/opta-match-stats. A little infield but looks alright for a winger.

Second game - Arsenal at home. Started as left wingback. His average position? http://www.liverpoolfc.com/fixtures2014/first-team/liverpool-v-arsenal-8231/opta-match-stats 

As you can see, the positon differs only little, he's just a little lower and more wider. And to add to that our formations with wingbacks almost always were unbalanced. Markovic was nearly every time the wingback who did more attacking work. That pushed Can higher and Sakho lower and it gave us a bit safer feeling at the back.

If we take the Tottenham game where he played as a CAM then you can see that he is on average at around the same zone as Ibe was at wingback - Lazar is even lower than Ibe. http://www.liverpoolfc.com/fixtures2014/first-team/liverpool-v-tottenham-8237/opta-match-stats. Also, notice, how low Tottenham's fullbacks are? That's about their normal position, maybe a little lower than usual. You can turn off other team's positions if that's distracting.

The only game where he looked completely out of place was Southampton away and there was a reason for it. Southampton pushed us hard on the wings and we had two non-fullback wingbacks. We didn't have much balance in that back five and we were forced to swap Can and Lovren to fight against Pelle and their right fullback overlapping - that mixed things up even more. Moreno was rightly brought on for him.

The point - wingbacks aren't fullbacks, far from it, especially in our system. We used them as wide midfielders - just a little lower than usual wingers. Think James Milner in City. When one was higher up the field then the other wingback was further down and Can and Sakho made sure that Moreno and Markovic both had support from the back.",null,0,null,1434048579,null,0,false,0,cs3cfo8,null,t3_39frj3,null,t1_cs3cfo8,null,t1_cs3apvc,null,null,null,1436916081,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

I suppose one thing that I noticed was that even the normal people there take a risk approach to healthcare. So, if they were younger, a lot of them would just think that the risk of something major happening was low and carry on regardless. Also, even when people have health insurance, there are a lot of costs associated with healthcare anyway. Like we have an excess for car insurance, they have something called a deductible with their health insurance, so they would end up having to pay the first few thousand dollars of any cost anyway. Even the co-pays with going to see a GP, or the ~$150 copay of going to the A&amp;E. That mindset is ingrained in them. Even people who had insurance would then find that their company wouldn't pay for something anyway - there are still loads of medical bankruptcies over there involving people who thought that they were covered.  Sometimes, people found that it was cheaper for them to buy their prescriptions themselves from Costco or Walmart or something, than to get it through their insurance at a normal pharmacy. It really is a market and risk approach to healthcare at every level.

Oh not this bullshit again. 

The greenbelt is just a tiny amount of the countryside. There'll be plenty more to visit if it takes you fancy, and we'll only need to build on a very small amount of the green belt to offer adequate housing for our citizens. 

We have currently built on 8% of our country, and that's enough (although not really) to house 63,000,000 people. It's not going to take much more to accommodate more. 

Quit fucking whinging. It's only ever the anti immigration crowd whose hearts bleed for the green belt because they just want one more weapon in their arsenal of wankstain anti-immigration rhetoric.
