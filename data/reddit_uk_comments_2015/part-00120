null,false,DEADB33F,null,null,null,"I rarely recommend credit cards for anything, but in this instance I think it may be a fair option.

If used correctly credit cards offer up to a 56 days interest free period on purchases.  

Use your savings to pay your moving costs, deposit, etc. Then use a credit card for your first month's groceries.  
When your first paycheque arrives, use it to pay your rent, utilities, and your credit card bill off in full. Use the remainder to buy next month's shopping.  
If you start to run dry before the next pay period use the card again for the last week or two but ensure that you pay it off in full again as soon as you're paid.

After a couple of months you'll be on your feet and will no longer need to use the credit card for daily purchases. 

Using this method you'll have paid zero interest on your CC purchases or had to pay any overdraft penalties, nor had to take out a loan or borrow money.

---

NB. Only follow this advice if you feel you have the self control to carry it out without treating your available CC balance as 'extra money'.

Don't be tempted by cards offering long interest-free periods or things like that. You shouldn't need them as all cards offer 56 days interest free and that's enough. Those longer periods offered are designed as traps so you'll spend your available CC balance then 6-months later can't afford to pay it all back and so start accruing large amounts of interest.

The secret to credit cards is to use them only when you have to and pay them back as soon as you can.",null,0,null,1427809784,null,0,1427810482,0,cpwmt05,null,t3_30tlvi,null,t1_cpwmt05,null,t3_30tlvi,null,null,null,1432115641,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

However I do believe strongly in progressive taxation of some kind, that those with more should contribute proportionally more than those with less (rather than say everybody paying the same flat rate of tax).

In the Bill Gates example, if you imposed a windfall wealth tax of 99% he'd still be left with $790 million, meaning he still has a lot of effective purchasing power. He can afford a lot of rent payments, electricity bills and grocery shops with that. Whereas if you imposed the same proportional wealth tax on someone on the breadline, you'd probably make them homeless.

And you can extrapolate that logic backwards to see that even someone with only a modest amount more money than someone else perhaps should be expected to contribute more proportionally. As the money they're left with still leaves them with more purchasing power than someone for whom an equivalent percentage of their income could leave them not being able to afford the shopping one week, for example.

Hmm. I hope I've articulated that right.

Edit: Something else to consider is that wealth tends to pool and needs some mechanism to be redistributed away from those who have it. One device is interest rates, so if you hang on to your money in savings it'll depreciate naturally. But those with money tend to have the most access to measures which mitigate that loss of value. They can invest the money in property or other forms. They can pass the money on to their heirs. So once earned money can stay within a small group and not necessarily benefit society at large. So it's useful that it be redistributed by some means or other.",null,0,null,1427810569,null,0,1427812050,0,cpwn7jm,null,t3_30wzn0,null,t1_cpwn7jm,null,t1_cpwmwy2,null,null,null,1432115832,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

Similarly, because she was out of the UK for longer than is technically allowed by the Tier 2 settlement rules, a Tier 2 case worker is technically supposed to refuse her application. The decision is *technically* correct. 

The thing with all of the above is that at any stage of this process, someone had the power to stand up for her and fight for her case. They could have passed the case higher up the management chain and argued that discretion should be applied in her case, and the lawyers could have chosen not to pursue the allowed appeal. Staff at UKVI aren't always powerless in the face of the rules - discretion *can* be applied, if someone is willing to give a shit.

I'm kind of surprised that there is nothing in the Tier 2 rules about academic field work. They just state that if someone is out of the UK for a certain period of time then they broke the rules (unless it was for illness of bereavement) but it's pretty apparent to everyone here that her academic duties abroad were instrumental to her job *in the UK*, and shouldn't count as ordinary absences.

I'd describe the Germans as efficient (I know, surprising right?), they created fewer chances, but were much more clinical, whereas England played well until we got close to the goal, then we'd blow a lot of chances.

Given the way the game was, Can did well when called upon, but didn't have too much of a chance to make a big impact.

As someone who studied engineering (I finished last year) I would definitely not like to see there be more spaces available for technical degrees. I was in a class of ~250 my first year and that's just one university. Deciding that everyone must get a degree has meant that 'menial' jobs now require them and for certain technical jobs they are also now required where they never used to be.

Accounting is a very good example of this, I have a friend (25yrs old) who went to college to get his professional qualifications, takes 2 years and is free, but my cousin (23yrs old) followed the same route but whilst going through college accountancy firms began only hiring university graduates, who have studied the around same amount of material but over 3 years and have paid to do so, meaning he's had to go to university to be able to get a job passed the base level of employment.",null,0,null,1427811636,null,0,false,0,cpwnrpl,null,t3_30solb,null,t1_cpwnrpl,null,t1_cpwjvry,null,null,null,1432116096,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Say they didn't blow it on drinking, the taxi and the rubbish associated with going out and getting wrecked. Then they could spend it on something else that possibly has more societal value or offers entertainment that has less damage associated with it.  

The drinking culture in the uk is absurd, there needs to be a massive educational push and looking at how to address
it in a productive manor.  

From my experience most people don't even like to get wrecked, a large issue with drink is that it literally incapacitates peoples ability and will which is why they drink to much and end up being sick or causing issues for others. 

So in short ""if everyone drank sensibly"" maybe they would have more money to spend on other things that do less damage or even have more in savings which would benefit the economy in different ways.

However, I feel that they can't criticise it because the religion is practiced by a minority ethnic group. They feel it would be racist to do so, so therefore shift the blame to the person complaining, 99% of the time a white ethnic person. They are literally blinded by political correctness, and the myths of ""white privilege"" and how everything is at fault of the whites. I've literally heard my friends say this when discussing Islam and it seems they struggle to understand the impact and effects the religion actually has on what they consider socially normative.

Ask them about Christianity, however, and you'll set them off on a tirade. Why? Because the majority is white :)

He makes it look really easy, so if you haven't ever actually tried to do it then it might not look quite so special.  So basically, he brings the ball down off his chest at a pretty weird angle (so the ball bounces a little fast and flat), it's bouncing away from the goal, and he's moving away from the goal.  In one motion he's able to turn his hips like 120* and get his foot wrapped all the way around the goal, all while pretty much jumping in the air so his foot makes the right contact with the ball.  The way he snaps his body around to still generate power onto the strike while he and the ball are bouncing away from the goal is just nuts.

Yes, you absolutely can near-guarantee the chance of getting tickets.  You need two things - a True Blue membership, and a membership in a Platinum-level overseas supporters club.  Chelsea sets some tickets aside for every game for members of overseas supporter clubs. 

There are a couple caveats here.  You need 5 LPs to be able to get tickets through your supporters club.  But the good news is that you get 5 bonus LPs just for getting a TB membership before July 31st.  The other thing is that you need to know WHEN you'll want a ticket as ordering through supporters clubs is done quite a bit ahead of time (3-6 weeks ahead).  But other than that, it's easy.  I've been to numerous home and away matches using overseas supporters tickets.

If you tell me where in Canada you are, I can help you find the supporter club most applicable to you.

Yes, they gave up some of their core policies (student tuition fees still smarts, for example), but I shudder to think how bad the Tories could have been if they were governing solely, even in a slight minority government.

This time round it's a bit different: if the Tories were to go it alone as a minority government, they will have many fewer seats than in 2010 and so be forced to compromise more, as you state.

&gt;In July, 2012 during the ""Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals"" conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:

&gt;&gt;Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.

Various species exhibit the capacity to problem-solve, to communicate via sign-language, to *deceive* others of its species, a capacity for numeracy, tool-use, etc. And to a greater degree than some members of *our* species are able to.

B) *Even if* we accepted that animals are not ""capable of intelligent thought"" (which is incorrect), would you then be okay with eating unintelligent humans? What about the seriously disabled or brain-dead? After all, they aren't capable of intelligent thought either, so why not eat them? I hear human meat tastes a lot like chicken.

exact thoughts on sterling...i just hope he signs a 3 year extension this summer, 120k/week would be fair for both parties, and keep him improving year on year. if he bangs in 15-20 goals next season and becomes even more influential, slog him off for 100m. hopefully by that point, we would have lacazette, sturridge, ibe, ojo, coutinho and more that would be the spine and sterling leaving would be  minor blip. sterling, though, could be a 60-70m player by the end of next summer in my opinion. and we'd be stupid to not sell.

laca is perfect, would love to have him. he literally checks every box, including durability. yea de bruyne's price tag worries me and i feel like he's actually in a perfect set up at wolfsburg. son is perfect becuse he can play any attacking position, is athletic, can score and very hard working. 

excited for this summer to come (and go) and we'll see the damage. im semi worried for rodger's job, but i hope fsg see what's really cooking in the kitchen.

Even if something does not have a high tax on it then that money circulates around the system and from what I can tell then get's stuck in low risk parts of the banking system or perhaps in property or maybe things that don't actively cause illness.   

If you feel we need to collect more tax in general that's fine but why collect it from alcohol specifically ?

I don't disagree that alcohol might pay for the damage it does It may or may not do and I think taxing potentially damaging things in a way to offset there damage cost is a good idea but I don't know what the actual data is as to if people getting wasted is a net finical benefit to society.  

It's also Worth keeping in mind that many models of that sort of thing don't tally social or the longer finical costs, for example the counseling for a kid who's parent was an alcoholic and then the damage that does over 50+ years.  

But based of the amount of death, the mess of town centers and the amount of police and medical time spent dealing with specific aspects of uk's drink culture I tend to lean in the direction that UK would be better off if people were not getting wrecked all the time. 

Just don't see how you came to the conclusion that people not making themselves sick is better than people making themselves sick. 

I just think some sort of action needs to be taken to change the drink culture in the uk, probably education mostly and maybe even more laws in terms of how alcohol can be marketed or sold. 

Don't get me wrong though I'm not against drinking or alcohol I brew my own wine and love making and drinking certain drinks. I just think the ""getting wasted"" culture is something that's depressing and damaging.

Labour have very little hold in England outside North London, Newcastle and the socialist triangle in the north between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.

In 2010 the Tories won 39.5% of the English vote, well above labour (due to the anomalies with boundaries that goes back to the 1990s), with just 8 seats won in Wales and 1 in Scotland out of 306 seats. Basically the English do tend to vote very strongly Tory - this is even more so outside of labours metropolitan areas.

Yeah I read a report saying he was turning down £180k a week; if that's true he can fuck off right now. If he gets his head down and agrees around £120k I'd be over the moon.

That's exactly why I'd love Son. He's so versatile, but he'll score goals from midfield and he works his ass off.

What the Tories usually blame Labour for is ""not fixing the roof while the sun was shining"" (Cameron used that phrase during the faux-debate IIRC).

In 2008 (and almost every year that decade) the government ran a deficit of 2-3% of GDP despite the good times rolling.  If Labour balanced the budget when the economy was booming, or indeed ran a modest surplus, we'd have had less total debt to contend with when shit hit the fan and less of a deficit to cull in the aftermath.

if he turned down 180k (lol if we offered that fuck off) but if he turned it down and we offered it, then sell him to highest bidder. we could definitely get 40m for him. if hazard was worth 32 from ligue 1, sterling is definitely worth 40 at the same age. i would also argue that sterling has been more impressive at 20 than hazard was. hazard is definitely the better player right now, but sterling is definitely performing at a higher level than hazard was at his age, and sterling did it in the epl not ligue 1 which admittedly the last decade has been on the decline in terms of top to bottom quality.

Thats like saying the guy who passed to Torres when he got tackled for the corner won us the CL. It was in no way a direct consequence, like Essien's bad clearance which had it drifted a yard left or right wouldn't have resulted in the Iniesta goal. Even thats not a direct mistake and we don't blame him for it when it was a shit ton more direct that this.

2) You can just update the settings on your specific computer to use google dns. Exactly how will depend on your os, but basically the two ip addresses you need are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Google ""how do I change my dns for windows 7"" or whatever your os is and you should find usable instructions.

&gt;You're comparing this to a holocaust where human beings are killed is idiotic, not to mention offensive. They are not victims, they are animals.

It's pretty bigoted of you to think that animals can't be victims. If you kick a puppy to death, you don't think the puppy was a victim?

Nothing you're writing here is anything other than the knee-jerk reaction of a speciesist. There's no content to your argument other than an instinctual response to the idea that maybe animal suffering matters. There's no argument at all, actually. All you're doing is shouting ""That's offensive!"" with no actual reasoning behind it.

How about you actually tell me why you believe the amount of suffering experienced by those in the Nazi holocaust (about 11 million) is *worse* than the suffering experienced by 280 billion over a similar same five-year time-frame?

You might not think an animal is worth *the same* as a person, but presumably you don't think it's worth *nothing*, seeing as you presumably see yourself as a good person. So do you really think 11 million humans outweigh 280 billion animals? Because I find *that* pretty offensive.

You say his smacking was the result of frustration. I wonder what verbal abuse he might have used in the place of smacking to relieve that frustration; and how much worse that might be affecting you to today.

The tickets themselves ended up being 45 quid a pop and we sat in the very back row of the ground floor in the Mathew Harding section.

 I emailed the landlord of the place we were staying at, when the tickets arrived she picked them up and placed them in the flat for us. The third party site is by all means not the way to go since the tickets were marked up(becomes a true blue member tickets are way cheaper) but if its your last option its definitely worth the risk.

 The game itself was incredible we scored in the 92'nd minute and if i remember correctly it was super frank who swung in a cross and no one got on it.

The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement ""receives the same judgement in philosophy and... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith.""[58] (The original document from the Inquisitorial commission was made widely available in 2014.[59])

Where on earth is there a reference to Galileo being incorrect? The model was rejected solely on religious dogma. Galileo also was not competing with Kepler. With Galileo publicly going toe to toe with the Catholic church there would never have been a culture change. Kepler would have also been told to be quiet.

In the end Galileo was finally imprisoned because he obeyed the Pope's wish and put the Pope's own argument in defence of geocentricism in his book.

Speciesist? Absolutely I do believe humanity (and dogs) should be our major concern. Not I might add at the expense of the entire ecosystem but that's a different argument. But me, you and everyone else are worth more than all the cow's there ever have been. 
Again animal suffering does matter I don't believe I argued against that but it doesn't matter as much as human suffering. I'm sorry if that offends but it plain doesn't.
A puppy can't be a victim because it isn't self aware (dependant on the breed and age) but the people who saw it happen would be because such cruelty is a terrible thing. However we aren't talking about kicking puppies to death. We are discussing eating habits which rely on animals far less worthwhile than puppies. 
The only exception to my rule is pigs because they are to a certain extent self aware but that is why I do not eat bacon.
I understand that we are going to have to eat less meat in future, I don't eat too much already. My issue is that human suffering is vastly more important than animal suffering. It's not a holocaust, or a genocide or anything like that. When done in a humane way it's is simply the act of feeding ourselves.

&gt;A puppy can't be a victim because it isn't self aware (dependant on the breed and age)

Even aside from the fact that self-awareness comes in degrees and dogs do possess it to some degree: So self-awareness is your criteria? The fact that it can experience pain and suffering isn't enough for it to qualify as a victim when you deliberately cause it pain? That seems pretty fucked up. Where in the definition or concept of victimhood does it require that the victim has self-awareness?

&gt;The reason being humans are capable of more than any of those animals.

Not all humans, though. What about the severely disabled? Those in a permanent vegetative state? Babies? The very elderly? There are animals out there that are stronger, faster, more intelligent, capable of *more* than some of these groups of humans. Do you think it is ethically acceptable for us to eat these humans? After all, they're not capable of the things you seem to expect of humans and, given that your criteria is some kind of vague, arbitrary capacity or potential, in order to be consistent (and therefore not irrational) you'd need to argue why there's a significant moral distinction between the two that doesn't come down to ""because my feels.""

&gt;My issue is that human suffering is vastly more important than animal suffering. It's not a holocaust, or a genocide or anything like that. 

Again, this is just specieism: it's a prejudice not backed up by anything rational. It's purely emotive, an instinctual, gut response. There's no logic behind your belief.

You repeatedly say that you care about animal welfare, but then give reasons why you think we shouldn't give a shit about how we treat them. According to you, animals cannot be victimised, and their suffering (even though it is real and traumatic) is of secondary concern to your taste buds. A cow might well not have *eual* moral worth to an adult human, but in terms of the sheer scale, can you *really* say 11 million humans outweigh 280 billion animals?

In the numerous history books written on the subject.

No, it was rejected because it didn't work as well as the better model, Kepler's, and contained numerous errors.

Kepler's work was accepted without question by the church as soon as it passed peer review, in fact they paid for it to be published and distributed. In fact as I already said, they had been enthusiastically endorsing it for over 10 years without ever ""telling Kepler to be quiet"".

Not quite.  He was a [sinecure canon of a chapter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus), such people were the administrators or government of Warmia.  He was never ordained and took the bare minimum of orders to maintain his job.

The church blatantly deemed [heliocentrism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#Religious_attitudes_to_heliocentrism) is be [heretical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei#Controversy_over_heliocentrism):

&gt;Biblical references Psalm 93:1, 96:10, and 1 Chronicles 16:30 include text stating that ""the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved."" In the same manner, Psalm 104:5 says, ""the Lord set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved."" Further, Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that ""And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place.""

&gt;By 1615 Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition, and his efforts to interpret the Bible were seen as a violation of the Council of Trent.[57] Attacks on the ideas of Copernicus had reached a head, and Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and Copernican ideas. In 1616, an Inquisitorial commission unanimously declared heliocentrism to be **""foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.**""

It's really not as difficult as it might seem at first. You can easily replace most of the meat you eat at home with Quorn or similar product which IMO tastes really good. You can buy chicken pieces, beef, chicken fillets, ham slices, burgers, pork/chicken pies, and more.  There are other brands like Stella McCartney and Amy's Kitchen that are also great veggie food. Just last week I had a (Quorn) steak pie, chips and a beer for dinner, tasted great. I'm not really missing out on anything. And cutting meat out of my diet has actually given me a much better appreciation for other food out there, particularly vegetables.

I really do recommend looking into it, there are plenty of resources out there like http://tryveg.com/ and plenty of reasons to make the switch, whether it's for ethical, environmental, or health-related reasons.

In reality it sounds like you will be obtaining your seeds from a private source in the UK or wherever. where as the shop i worked for would buy big brand name seeds from big UK wholesalers and all receipts and tax documents would be provided, legit business.

Also the seed industry is quite a saturated one right now, with all the developments in the US canna industry &amp; Spanish social clubs, new breeders are popping out of the wood work almost every other week. even the underground uk scene is producing some breeders winning cups over in Amsterdam, like truecanna genetics and lady sativa genetics.

As for the first part of the post (I'm on a kindle so actually quoting what you said is a pain in the arse) dogs do possess self awareness to some degree. I would say it becomes wrong to harm any animal arbitrarily. Again we aren't discussing animal cruelty a s commonly understood. Just your version of it.

From a scientific point of view rather than your own emotive response (I doubt whether I am guilty of that, but even if I am your choice of such an emotive subject shows that you aren't blameless of emotive arguments) I would say that since it cannot conceive of the pain it suffers other than as a feeling it cannot be classed as a victim. 
Also you keep accusing me of emotive arguments and having no logic. I struggle to find it in your own I'm afraid and I'm beginning to wonder if you understand what it means.

The Bundesliga is more similar to the PL than pretty much any league in terms of the way the game is played there. I'd still suggest most low Bundesliga teams aren't that great. The gulf that isn't replaced by compensating tactics seems far larger in several leagues than the PL. I'd admit that seems lower in the Bundesliga.

Everyone here seems to be complaining about the Bundesliga really because they rate it highly. And in fairness it has improved dramatically in recent years.

Italy by all accounts is another story, if not an opposing story. It is unbelievably terrible in quality. (Maybe even at the same level as the French league ahaha)

There aren't many European leagues to leave out of a Top 5 then really are they. That argument is a bit pointless. Perhaps you'd rather the use of poorer or lesser leagues. If you rate the leagues in an order. And then you have below the top 2, then those are obviously poorer. How much do you even talk about the Eredivisie or even the Allsvenskan? Barely ever I imagine. And the Eredivisie is a historically important league but I don't think many would argue it's a really good league would they.

null,false,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,null,"You write in very large paragraphs (Presumably because you're on a tablet) so I hope you don't mind if I try and pull out a few of the key points as quotations and offer some responses to them, because there's a few parts of your answer that are really part of the same line of reasoning. The first bit is about intelligence:

&gt;Cow's, deer and chickens can't so let's eat those because they cannot conceive of the suffering of other members of their species.

&gt;Kicking a puppy would probably be classified as victimisation by most people I agree. From a scientific point of view rather than your own emotive response (I doubt whether I am guilty of that, but even if I am your choice of such an emotive subject shows that you aren't blameless of emotive arguments) I would say that since it cannot conceive of the pain it suffers other than as a feeling it cannot be classed as a victim.

Do they need to though? Is it a morally relevant factor? They, as individuals, experience pain in *exactly* the same sense we do; possibly even more intensely, actually. So isn't that enough for us to respect? Do we really need to be able to say that one chicken can comprehend the suffering of the chicken next to it before we say it's wrong to kill it? Why isn't its own ability to suffer and experience pain enough?

I'm also doubtful of your claim that they cannot comprehend the suffering of other animals. For example, chickens actually form fairly complex social relationships and bonds with other chickens. They have friendships and enmities, with groups and hierarchies. I find it difficult to believe that one chicken cannot recognise that the one next to it is experiencing pain, if for no other reason than evolutionary reasons that it's pretty important that you know that the thing next to you is being hurt so you should probably escape or fight. Pigs, for example, experience massive amounts of psychological trauma on the way to the slaughterhouse because they're intelligent enough to work out where their friends went, what happened to them, and what's now going to happen to them, which is the whole reason why the people who maintain these factory-farms try and devise methods of making sure the pigs don't know where they're going or what's happening.

&gt;We are actually capable of comprehending the suffering of our own species.

This is the problem though, *some humans aren't*. I mean, consider just one of the examples I posed in the last post, of those who were involved in some kind of accident that led to them being put into a Permanent Vegetative State (PVS). These individuals are not capable of comprehending the suffering of their own species. Can we kill and eat them? Is there any ethical reason why we shouldn't if on that same basis we can do the same thing to, say, chickens?

&gt;I would say it becomes wrong to harm any animal arbitrarily.

What's ""arbitrary""? Because for me, ""their meat tastes good"" is pretty arbitrary, but for you it seems not to be. At least in most of the developed world including this country, we don't need to kill animals to survive, to live healthy, happy lives, or even to enjoy great-tasting, nutritious, and healthy food. So why do it?

&gt;Also you keep accusing me of emotive arguments and having no logic. I struggle to find it in your own I'm afraid and I'm beginning to wonder if you understand what it means. My definition is that you rely on reason, science and experimentation to come to a moral decision (where morality is the issue). What's yours? 

My reasoning for my stance is pretty simple. I argue that there is *no* morally relevant difference between humans and other animals that makes it morally acceptable to kill the latter for meat but not the former. Whether it's intelligence, consciousness, capacity for reason, emotion, memories, relationships with other beings, etc etc. - there is no feature you can show me that humans possess that I cannot show some animals possess and that some humans do not.

I think there are strong independent arguments for why it is morally unacceptable to kill said human 'marginal cases', and that I think by extension apply to animals as well.

There are other reasons to condemn killing animals for food as well. The amount of pain and suffering we cause them is truly horrific. The environmental cost is huge: it costs us 12 pounds of grain to get 1 pound of meat in return, and 30% of the earth's landmass is dedicated to that very process. And the contribution to climate change from thing like methane levels is significant.

*Never* sign into anything when contacted by anyone claiming to be from anywhere, ask them for their customer service / tech support telephone number and call them back.

You can almost never go wrong with this method, although there is a scam whereby they don't actually hang up, play a dial tone down your phone and fool you into thinking you're making an outgoing call when you try to dial out. The only way to avoid this is by switching phones, from landline to mobile or vice-versa.

I'm actually not quite a vegan haha. I'm somewhere in between vegetarian and vegan. I don't eat any meat or anything with gelatin in, I don't use leather products, and I buy oat or soya milk instead of dairy milk. When I'm eating in a restaurant with other people I'm generally happy to just stick with the vegetarian option. My main blind-spot ethically which I'm open about are eggs and cheese, though I always buy eggs from neighbours who I know don't kill any of their chickens and feed/look after them properly. Plus I reckon I'm still doing a much better job of minimising animal suffering than 99% of people so I'm probably not going to be first up against the wall come the revolution!

I guess the thing to think about is really that last bit of what I said, about why I'm a veggie.

null,false,TheTrooper92,null,null,null,"Sorry, as /u/worly mentioned - I'd be getting money from my girlfriend (or alternatively a tenant in the second bedroom) towards the mortgage.

Using HSBC mortgage calculator on their website I put through the numbers as an example:

Property value: 300,000
Deposit amount: 30,000
Term: 25 years

A selection of the mortgages they offered:

Cheapest: £1,143 per month (3.7%)

One from the middle: £1,395 per month (4.0%)

Most expensive: £1,546 per month (4.9%)

Obviously the interest rates could change. But if I'm getting even £600 from the girlfriend or a tennant, then I'd feel confident I could afford the rest if I were taking home £2,200 after tax.


Potential example:
Mortgage = £1,600 per month

I get money from girlfriend as rent = £600

Therefore I have to pay £1,000 towards the mortgage.
I would be taking home £2,200. Leaving me with £1,200 for everything else.

Regardless, this wasn't about affordability. Although I do appreciate everyone's input and concerns you've raised. Even if I did manage to wrangle an impossible mortgage, I'd hope that I'd then be rational enough to work out the figures and see if I could physically afford to pay it every month. And then refuse if I knew I couldn't afford it.

The post was more around the first part of this situation - is there a possibility of getting the mortgage in the first place with some help from parents. Not so much focusing on whether or not I can afford it, since I can work that out myself.

Once again, appreciate all of the feedback and points you've all raised. Cheers for the help!",null,0,null,1427821464,null,0,1427821756,0,cpwtvmf,null,t3_30uvrr,null,t1_cpwtvmf,null,t1_cpwm2j7,null,null,null,1432119040,null,-1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,-1,null

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; Yes they were the single largest party in England in 2010

By a broad margin of 2 million votes.

&gt; Also remember 39.5% was their peak in recent years

It was their highest level since 1992. However, In 2001 (their worst year in recent memory) they still secured 8.3 million votes - not that far below labours 10.7 million. This is to do with the boundary issue that has existed since the early 1990s. Essentially the demographics of the constituency boundaries has changed on the ground, but hasn't been updated in legislation. This will be some ways addressed in 2020 when boundaries will be redrawn to have roughly the same number of voters (+/- 5% of a national average). Most predictions suggest under current conditions the Conservatives would win an extra 20 seats. 

Essentially it means labour wins more seats with fewer votes than the tories must get to achieve the same number of seats. 

It means that the number of MPs in the house of commons doesn't necessarily reflect very well the actual numbers of people voting tory - and as I've shown above they poll consistently well in England. 

You are of course facetiously correct to point out they didn't achieve over 50% of the vote and therefore are not a ""majority"" but the bottom line is they are (and look to be) the most voted for party in England by a fair margin. Infact only twice in the last 200 years has a party secured more than 50% of the overall vote - in 1900 and 1931, (on both occasions Conservative). The trouble with your inference is that you jump to the conclusion that anyone not voting Tory would be happy with any alternative. It probably isn't true, and indeed the 10-15% of the population that are expected to vote UKIP would probably for the most part prefer a Tory government as a good example.

* Continuing to apply severe penalties to those who manufacture, import or deal in illegal drugs, and clamp down on those who produce and sell unregulated chemical highs.
* Establishing a review to assess the effectiveness of the cannabis legalisation experiments in the United States and Uruguay, in relation to public health and criminal activity. 
* Legislating to make the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs independent in setting the classification of drugs, while remaining accountable to Parliament and the wider public.
* Enabling doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use.
* Putting the Department of Health rather than the Home Office in charge of drug policy.

Which is not the same as either Labour or Conservatives.

null,false,thebirdandthebee,null,null,null,"Alonso was shunted out of the club. Basically circa 2006, he lost form, so Rafa threatened to sell him. Alonso came back into form. 

Then, Rafa was pissed off that Alonso took time off from an important match because his girlfriend at the time (now his wife) was having their first child, and he chose to stay instead of going out to the match (I think it was with an Italian team). Alonso said that he wouldn't have minded flying out to join the team, but it was important for him to stay with his girlfriend (considering they were Spanish, in a foreign country, and according to him, when he spoke to other footballers like Carra, it seems that their wives resented them being away at matches when they were giving birth). Rafa missed his father's funeral for a match, so Alsono's decision didn't sit well with him at all.

There's more to it, and if you do the google time machine, you'll see how long and painful the transfer drama was. Alonso was linked with Serie A but Real Madrid stumped up the £30 million LFC wanted. 

Rafa's man management skills were his undoing (it works -- until it does not work) and Alonso said that after Rafa threatened to sell him, he remembered that football was a business, and Real Madrid was a better club than LFC and he wanted to go back home. Benitez forced Alonso to force the transfer, because himself and Alonso didn't see eye to eye at all. Also, the club needed money and homegrown players, so they were supposed to go after Gareth Barry. 

*I know*. 

Alonso didn't get a chance to say goodbye to the club, because his transfer came through in August, when LFC were going to play a friendly before the season started,  and he found out in the airport queue on their way to Norway. Got dragged out of the queue, and got on the first thing smoking to Madrid. There are youtube clips with his interviews, but none with him on the field doing the ball bouncing seal act like all the players do.

Note this is not necessarily bad and I did the same thing. To them income tax isn't that relevant (not earning enough to care), pensions don't matter (probably won't live to get one), NHS important but not top of the line (young people are generally the fittest) and basically the most important issue to them is their freedom. Freedom to say what they want, go where they want, do what they want. And the one impacting that is things like drug laws.

Also they are likely to be the ones who are most falling foul of drug laws. Drug using adults can do it at home, those who live at home with parents have to go outside and do it (particularly weed which stinks) and therefore greater risk of getting caught. 

They probably also have friends who regularly use *something* and also likely have been caught and had what is seen as an unfair punishment.

Again I am not saying anyone is wrong for supporting drug reform (I agree, decriminalise it and save a butt-ton of money) but I think this site has a clear bias in favour of legalisation, sometimes the detriment of other policies.

After weeks of shadowboxing and phoney wars the UK general election kicked off in earnest on Monday with Ed Miliband, the opposition Labour party leader, making his pitch to British business. It is not an easy sell. Many chief executives fear he would lead a leftwing government with far less sympathy for business and the private sector than New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.


Mr Miliband’s speech at his party’s 2011 conference, condemning “asset strippers” and “predators” who were “interested in the fast buck, taking what they can out of business”, alarmed many. Their anxiety was stoked by Labour’s planned two-year freeze on energy prices, and his pledge this weekend to stop private suppliers from gaining a profit of more than 5 per cent on National Health Service contracts.


Some believe that Mr Miliband, a former adviser and Labour minister who has not worked outside politics and academia, holds profitmaking in contempt, despite his assurance that he backs “the vast majority of our businesses that have the right values and do the right thing”. One head of a FTSE 100 company says: “Their response when they see business is to regulate it. They don’t trust businesspeople; they don’t trust their motives; they don’t trust their intentions.”


Mr Miliband is seeking to replace the Conservative-Liberal coalition led by Prime Minister David Cameron. With most opinion polls suggesting the May 7 general election will be the tightest for a generation Labour can ill afford to alienate anyone.


It is trying to strike a balance. Mr Miliband believes that the financial crisis altered attitudes to free market capitalism, and opinion polls suggest voters are more suspicious not only of banks but of big business in general. Labour’s energy freeze policy and other proposed interventions in, for example, privatised railways, have polled well. But it does not want to break its relationship with the private sector.

Suspicion is not confined to outsiders — the policies articulated by Mr Miliband and crafted by Stewart Wood, a former university professor who sits in Labour’s shadow cabinet, horrify some on the party’s right. “They don’t know what a market is. Their view of a market is a mechanism for businesses to abuse or to inflate prices and fleece consumers,” says one former Labour cabinet minister. “They talk about capitalism needing to be reformed, but what they really mean is at best tolerated, and at worst controlled.”

There is a disjunct between the deepest fears of Mr Miliband’s critics and the policies that Labour has set out in its manifesto. Although some are more interventionist than the previous Labour government, for example in the regulation of banks and changes to merger rules to stop takeovers that are judged against the public interest, they are a long way from the socialist “alternative economic strategy” advocated by the Labour left in the early 1980s.


Indeed, Lord Wood cites as the inspiration for the policies a leader on the party’s right — Harold Wilson and his government of 1964, which attempted to reinforce industrial policy and forge “a new Britain” in the “white heat” of scientific revolution. “We cannot go around telling businesses ‘we won’t introduce changes’ because it is not true, but this is not an attempt to attack business, grab wealth or anything like that,” Lord Wood says. “We want a high- wage, high-skills economy.”


Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, points to the UK’s poor productivity performance and rising insecurity among low paid workers. “We want to retain open, dynamic markets but there are aspects of industrial policy we can introduce without conflicting with that,” he says. “You are always recalibrating to the new challenges you face, and the degree of risk that has moved from employers to employees has gone way too far. That’s not only unfair to the individuals but is inimical to quality and higher productivity.”


For some, the stumbling block is one of rhetoric and attitude. “I have a lot of respect for Ed Balls,” says Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors. “He was a very good City minister and instinctively understands the dynamics of business but I think that people are scared by the theoretical approach and doctrinaire views of Ed Miliband and Stewart Wood. Miliband doesn’t take much interest in business and he doesn’t really relate to it.”

This reflects an internal tension. Mr Miliband and Lord Wood talk of breaking with the past, turning decisively away from New Labour, while Mr Balls and others including Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, and Liam Byrne, shadow minister for science and skills, emphasise continuity. The latter are keener to reassure businesses and ease hostility. “Producers versus predators was a poor way to express it. If you start making boxes for people that are labelled good and bad, you’re on the wrong track,” says one adviser.


The producer/predator speech was not accidental. It reflects a school of thought that became influential 30 years ago, when Labour was trying to regroup under its then leader Neil Kinnock after Margaret Thatcher’s heavy electoral defeat in 1983 of Michael Foot, the most openly socialist of its postwar leaders. The UK suffered from high unemployment and bad industrial relations, exemplified by the 1984-85 miners’ strike, and Labour looked outward to the productive and harmonious German economy.



It concluded that the UK was prone to short-termism, an economy over-dominated by the City of London, lack of co-operation among employers and workers, inadequate training and low industrial productivity. One remedy lay in continental Europe, especially Germany, with its regional Landesbanks and local savings banks offering long-term finance to smaller companies, its commitment to apprenticeships, its antipathy to speculation and worker representatives on supervisory boards.



Mr Miliband’s call for “not financial engineering, but real engineering” reflects this tradition, as did his condemnation of the allegedly “predatory” private equity ownership of Southern Cross, a failed UK chain of care homes. It recalls the description of German private equity funds as “locusts” by Franz Müntefering, the former chairman of the Social Democratic party. Conversely, Mr Miliband praised Rolls-Royce, the UK aerospace company and engineering employer.
“I think they are still quite keen on the European model. I see Stewart [Wood] taking as much as he can from Europe, although realising there are things that cannot be transferred,” says Mark Wickham-Jones, a professor at Bristol University who has studied postwar Labour policy. Mr Miliband first met Lord Wood in Berlin, when he was visiting David Soskice, a friend and former tutor. Lord Wood worked on his PhD under Professor Soskice, now at the London School of Economics.


Prof Soskice studied the differences between the UK’s liberal market economy and the “co-ordinated market economies” of countries such as Germany, and Lord Wood wrote a chapter of Varieties of Capitalism, a book he co-edited with Peter Hall in 2001. He is now sceptical about whether the UK can usefully follow the German model and believes it should instead pursue a path similar to that of the US and countries such as Denmark, reinforcing high-value industries in clusters based around research universities, as with Silicon Valley and Stanford.




The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists



“I have great respect and admiration for Miliband and Wood, but the German system is different to ours. I think we’re much more like the US and that’s the direction we should go in, rather than trying to counter it,” says Prof Soskice. Lord Wood says that the UK needs “a twin track strategy” of learning from Germany for some industries, such as engineering, while adopting the high-value cluster approach for others.


In practice, the German model is not the biggest cause of angst for business leaders. Many agree about the problem of short-termism and shareholder pressure to get rapid results. They bemoan the skills gap and the difficulty of finding younger recruits with suitable training, and would not object to new funding institutions such as Labour’s planned British Investment Bank. Mr Miliband’s firm support of UK membership of the EU , and his rejection of an In-Out referendum, also play well.


They are more alarmed when Mr Miliband talks of “fixing broken markets”, or as Lord Wood puts it, “repairing and reforming” them. Some fear that, while Mr Miliband talks about seeking more competition in areas such as banking and energy, he actually wants to fix prices and cap profits in various industries to win favour with consumers.

New rules
Lord Wood disputes that, pointing out that “the energy market price freeze is not the policy but an intermediary step” while the industry’s regulatory structure would be reformed. In banking, Labour has focused on trying to create more “challenger” banks. “In neither case is the state taking over from the market. I know this is not how it is sometimes perceived, but the philosophy is to sharpen competition,” he says. In industries such as retailing, which are already sufficiently competitive, there will not be similar interventions.



But he makes no secret of his ambition for how a Labour government would change the UK’s economic framework and the economy’s supply side, comparing it to the scale of free market reforms under the Thatcher governments of the 1980s, albeit in another direction. “Business and the economy are at the heart of our political project. Thatcher was right: if you change the economy, you change the character of the country . . . Markets need rules and in some key areas we think Britain needs different ones.”


There is a touch here of Wilson’s election-winning manifesto in 1964, after 13 years of Tory government, with its talk of “a selfish get-rich-quick mood, in which public interest subordinated to private advantage” and of ensuring “the consumer gets better value for money by attacking selling rackets of all kinds”. Lord Wood also cites the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, the US president who promised “a square deal” for Americans by busting corporate trusts.
Such ambition stirs worries among businesses, and elsewhere in the leadership. “People saying ‘Let’s have a revolution, let’s change everything’ makes businesses think there must be something we aren’t telling them, but there isn’t,” says a shadow minister. The question lingers as to how to judge Labour — on most policies, or on Mr Miliband’s tone. Many business leaders would prefer not to have to find out, but they may have no choice after May 7.

Business agenda: Supply-side changes laced with greater competition
Many of Labour’s business-related proposals focus on changing the supply side of the UK economy — how its labour market, education and training system, and financial framework operate. They also emphasise the importance of increasing the level of competition within industries.


For lower-paid workers, it wants to increase the minimum wage to £8 per hour by 2020 (it is currently £6.50 per hour for those aged 21 and above), and to encourage more employers to pay the “living wage” — defined as a higher basic rate — (currently £7.85 per hour outside London) through tax rebates and reporting requirements on listed companies. It would also prohibit “exploitative” zero hours contracts.


On training, it wants to introduce a technical baccalaureate for 16- to 18-year-olds, and ensure that all young people study English and mathematics until the age of 18. It would require private companies with major government contracts, including infrastructure projects, to provide apprenticeships and give employers more control over standards.


Labour promises to cut and freeze rates (local taxes) for small businesses and set up a British Investment Bank to foster more lending to the sector. Its task force on small business calls for the establishment of a network of local banks called Sparks, modelled on German Sparkassen savings banks.
The party’s proposed competition regime is one of its most controversial policies, since Mr Miliband promised to freeze domestic energy prices until 2017 as part of a “reset” of the market. It intends to force energy companies to buy and sell on an open market, while increasing competition in retail banking and fostering “challenger banks”.


Labour wants to extend industrial policy across the economy, including service sector employers. It says that it intends to “secure the jobs of the future by backing sectors where the UK has a competitive edge”.

The trade in Cannabis would be the subject of a Royal Commission (see below), with a view to establishing a fully legalised, controlled and regulated trade. Small-scale possession of drugs for personal use would be decriminalised. The starting point would be advice to policing authorities to caution rather than prosecute for offences of drug possession for personal use and to refer offenders to the health-care services (see DU411). Subsequently, regulations would be brought forward removing criminal sanctions for simple possession of controlled drugs for personal use. The recommended sentences for small-scale supply would be non-custodial options. The possession of pipes made for the use in connection with smoking of opium would no longer be a criminal offence. A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use. This commission would, after wide consultation, consider and recommend frameworks of social, economic and health conditions for drug use and supply.

Radical Islam's prevalence has much more to do with the rise of Islamism as a religious and political philosophy rather than socioeconomic factors, in my opinion. The Muslim Brotherhood in early-mid 20th century Egypt, and the thinkers it produced, shaped the Muslim world throughout the 20th century. Saudi also exported its own radical doctrine.

null,false,brokenairguitar,num18,,null,"I thought this stat was useful when thinking about the articles that rhetorically ask ""where would Spurs be without Harry Kane"" as it makes little sense to just negate ALL of his goals. 

So there are a couple options to investigate as I see it: (i) assume that a player finds himself in all the same positions as Kane but converts at the expected amount, which is why I posted this blog article; (ii) assume that Kane is replaced by a league-average striker with that striker's goal tally.

To achieve the 2nd point, here is the list of [top goal scorers in the league](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/index.html?paramSearchType=BY_STAT&amp;paramSeason=2014-2015). If we imagine that Kane is replaced with someone like a Sakho, Jelavic, Diouf (all of whom scored 8 so far) then we can see Kane is out-performing the ""average"" (not statistical, just fuzzy qualitative) striker by over two-fold.

Combining these two ideas, we can see that Kane has real talent in the form of positioning (as his expected goals by positions is almost 14, good enough for 5th overall).",null,0,null,1427824558,null,0,1427825722,0,cpwvx13,null,t3_30xlby,null,t1_cpwvx13,null,t3_30xlby,null,null,null,1432120002,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

One winter I wasn't long into the ride before a bunch of kids in a coach started pointing and laughing at me, and wouldn't stop. More kids came to the back window, until it was full of pointing, giggling teenagers. Of course, I didn't take kindly to this, and got angrier and angrier, until I was flicking them the middle finger, and changing down a couple of gears to overtake. 

What I haven't mentioned yet is the bike I was riding, and what I was wearing. Given that I hadn't ridden the trip yet without it pissing down at some point I'd  hunted through my dad's garage until I'd found a few things I thought would make the trip better.

This and companion apps on mobile devices could (but shouldn't to any well adjusted player) make it more likely that someone could use the behaviours they learnt in-game in the real world.

Section 1. [**National identity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Northern_Ireland#National_identity) of article  [**People of Northern Ireland**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%20of%20Northern%20Ireland): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;In Northern Ireland, national identity is complex and diverse. The two most common identities are [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people) and [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people). Most people of Protestant background consider themselves British, while a majority of people of Catholic background consider themselves Irish. This has origins in the 17th century [Plantation of Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster), when mainly-Catholic [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) was colonized by Protestant settlers from Great Britain.

&gt;In the early 20th century, most Ulster Protestants and Catholics saw themselves as Irish, although Protestants also had a strong sense of Britishness.  With the onset of the [Home Rule Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Rule_Crisis) and [events that followed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_revolutionary_period), Protestants gradually began to abandon Irish identity,  as Irishness and Britishness moreso came to be seen as mutually exclusive. In 1968 – just before the onset of [the Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) – 39% of Protestants described themselves as British and 20% described themselves as Irish, while 32% chose an Ulster identity.  By 1978, following the worst years of the conflict, there had been a large shift in identity amongst Protestants, with the majority (67%) now calling themselves British and only 8% calling themselves Irish.   This shift has not been reversed.  Meanwhile, the majority of Catholics have continued to see themselves as Irish.  In the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), both Protestants and Catholics overwhelmingly see themselves as Irish. 

&gt;From 1989, 'Northern Irish' began to be included as an identity choice in surveys, and its popularity has grown since then.  Some organizations have promoted 'Northern Irish' identity as a way of overcoming sectarian division. In a 1998 survey of students, this was one of the main reasons they gave for choosing that identity, along with a desire to appear 'neutral'.  However, surveys show that 'Northern Irish' identity tends to have different meanings for Catholics and Protestants.  Surveys also show that those choosing 'Northern Irish' regard their national identity as less important than those choosing British and Irish.

Well...do you hate them equally? If not, choose the one you hate less.

Or alternatively, if you feel they're equal or that the difference isn't worth worrying about, vote for a party you *don't* hate.

Or if there isn't a party you don't hate, even enough to find them significantly preferable to any of the others, probably spoiling your ballot is the best idea.

Whatever you do, *don't* think of it as a one-off decision with no impact beyond deciding the next government. Broad voting changes change the nature of political debate, affecting who politicians pander to and what policies the main parties (even if hateful) reckon will be vote winners.

So while the original core and the top tier might not be racist, they have a portion of their members who probably don't realize that UKIP advocates more migration from non EU nations and less from EU nations, and come up with crazy shit that gets in the papers. 

Also some people claim that anti-immigration is racist by itself, which is that. 

My tuppence is that UKIP is going through the teething problems that plague all new parties. Its not had time to establish its position and its rapidly expanding. It gets a influx of idealists who speak before thinking and the whole party gets branded with their ideals. Greens are facing a similar problem, though not quite to the extent. SNP, PC etc all had similar problems during their early years. A few nutters even slip into the well established parties. 

If UKIP and the other new parties survive to the next election (and I hope they do, more parties will hopefully mean the big two will actually become distinguishable again, and pulls us away from the two party calamity that is the US) then I suspect that they will have worked out how to manage who they select much better, rather than a Mad rush. Tories, Lab etc have all been laying the foundations for the election for years and years. Grooming candidates etc. UKIP, Greens and the smaller parties have basically set up their campaigns in the last couple of years ago. 

And again, any Anti-Immigration sentiments is jumped on by various elements of the media as racist. I think that was long term foolish of the liberal media, because it meant that rather it being debated on, it was basically forced into a pressure cooker and the results long term is frustration and anger.

They are issued cannabis warnings at three times the rate.

&gt;Every year, between ten per cent and 15% of all indictable offences brought before the courts are for drug possession. The people who get prosecuted are young – often very young.

I think the best way to get his pay reversed would be to just decrease his next pay by the £280 (And you'd give him the £200 if he's already given it to you.) However, this would mess things up now anyway as the next pay will be in the next tax year so it wouldn't be a legitimate way to sort it.

I can't think of another way of sorting this out without getting the restaurant into a pickle with the HMRC because they missed you off the books.

Like I said, your best bet is to try and push for it off the guy who got the extra pay.

If that doesn't work try getting in touch with the restaurant and asking if they can sort it out because it was their mistake in the first place.

Ben Webster Environment Editor
Last updated at 12:01AM, March 31 2015
A report that persuaded doctors to oppose fracking was partly written by a campaigner opposing shale gas extraction near his home.
Medact, a health charity, said that its report had examined fracking “through a comprehensive public health lens” and found it could increase “risks of cancer, respiratory disease and birth defects”.
The “expert” report prompted a prominent group of health professionals to write to the British Medical Journal calling for fracking to be banned “on public health and ecological grounds”.
Signatories to the letter, published by the BMJ yesterday, include Dr Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Helen Gordon, chief executive of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, and Dr Sheila Adam, former deputy chief medical officer.
They based their letter on Medact’s report, which fails to mention that one of its “contributors”, Mike Hill, is standing in the general election as an anti-fracking candidate in Fylde, Lancashire, centre of the emerging shale industry.
Mr Hill, who lives in Fylde and is a former member of Defend Lytham, a campaigning organisation opposed to fracking, wrote a report for Friends of the Earth accusing the Environment Agency of lacking the ability to regulate the shale industry.
He has previously been accused of misrepresenting himself by claiming to have advised the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the European Union on fracking.
A DECC source said: “Mr Hill has rather over-promoted himself. Filling in a consultation [form] doesn’t make him an adviser.”
Mr Hill’s election website publishes a number of what it calls “fracts” about fracking, including the claim: “They will destroy the value of your property.”
The Medact report, Health and Fracking, mentions that Mr Hill contributed to three of the six chapters and describes him as an author of “numerous briefing notes and papers on fracking”.
Dr David McCoy, director of Medact and former director of public health in Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, said he had not realised that Mr Hill was standing as an anti-fracking candidate.

They're often chockfull of great actives like antioxidant, vitamin C and other actives. You don't need to worry when you see a serum having one too many antioxidant, since they're best working in conjunction. The more the merrier. AHA and BHA are preferred in liquidy vehicle, though, AFAIK.

I like mine to have vitamin C (L-AA or its derivatives, MAP/SAP; although, for now I prefer the latter as I had bad experience with L-AA in the past and haven't revisited). Other stuff I like seeing in my serum are:

* Niacinamide
* Panthenol
* EGCG
* Kelp ferment or ferment anything, LOL
* Hyaluronic Acid
* Ferulic acid
* Aloe
* Allantoin
* Phloretin
* Tocopheryl Acetate (not Tocopherol; I have SD/PD-prone skin and try to avoid potential triggers if I can)
* Some peptides wouldn't hurt

I have tried a bunch. I'm currently using **[Lucy Essentials Vitamin C Serum](http://lucyminerals.com/product/lucy-essentials-vitamin-c-serum/)**, but once it's finished I'm going to try revisiting L-AA with **[Skin Actives Vitamin C Serum with Ascorbic Acid (L)](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)** or return to **[Skin Actives Antioxidant Serum with ROS* Terminator](http://www.skinactives.com/Antioxidant-Serum-Glutaredoxin-SOD.html)** (used to be called Complete Hydrophilic Antioxidant Serum/CHAS). Skin Actives has a branch/franchise (I'm not sure what would be the correct term) in UK called Active Formulas.

Others I have tried in the past are:

* [Silk Naturals Super Serum](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/serums/super-serum-must-have-675.html)
* [Silk Naturals Vitamin C Peptide Serum](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/serums/vitamin-c-peptide-serum-601.html)

Others also I've seen often recommended are:

* SkinCeuticals
* Cosmetic Skin Solutions (SkinCeuticals's knockoff, but great)
* Timeless Skin Care (also SC's knockoff)
* NuFountain
* HABA Fair/White Lady (same thing, different name in different geographic market)
* [ASDM Beverly Hills Vitamin C Serum 15%](http://www.asdmbeverlyhills.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-15--Vitamin-C-15-ASDM-Beverly-Hills_p_50.html)
* [Ole Henriksen Truth Serum ® Collagen Booster](https://www.olehenriksen.com/p-68-truth-serum-collagen-booster.aspx)

Those serums above aren't particularly hydrating. Depending on your skin's needs, you may need additional hydrating serum and/or moisturizer. I prefer a hydrating serum or light moisturizer for my skin type (combo, sensitive, prone to: SD/PD flareups, hives breakout).

Hydrating serums that I have tried:

* [Silk Naturals Oatmeal Hydrating Serum](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/serums/oatmeal-hydrating-serum-601.html) - *loved it*

* [Skinceuticals Hydrating B5 Gel](http://www.skinceuticals.com/hydrating-b5-gel-635494117004.html) - *hated it, irritated the heck out my skin and gave me bad SD flareup*

This website has clearly discovered some great undercover stonecutter-esque secret society to profit out of the poor and unhealthy of this land.

Regardless, a lot of these people clearly have huge conflicts of interests and I don't know how this isn't jumped on by the parliamentary authorities who look at these things for the politicans,  and how it is not illegal for those who are not politicians.

On the other hand people act as if privitisation in the NHS is a new thing, it is not. Every GP surgery does and always has operated as a private, for profit enterprise, for the benefits of the GPs and their investors and creditors. Everytime I've been to a GPs office I'm pretty sure I didn't have doctors refusing to treat me until I had remortgaged my house and sold my children into slavery.

Of course one might argue that a group of GPs running a practice should be more trustworthy and responsible than a board of directors answering to shareholders, you might be correct.  

However, I wish people would stop going on about private/public. Honestly why does it matter? Surely what is most important is standards of care? Surely what matters is that we have a health service that is free at the point of use, paid out of general taxation and if that service comes from either a public or private provider I don't really care, I think both can bring benefits to the system because what we have now is clearly not fit for purpose in terms of our aging population. 

What I would love to see is a cross party board of politicians, (maybe even from the house of lords? lets get some doctors in there) to remove the NHS from politics almost entirely. MPs work on 5 year cycles and for an institution as large as the NHS there is no way you can accomplish anything short of tinkering with the fringes in 5 years. It needs a long term (20-30 year) reform plan with support from everyone and not, what has happened, have a succession of health secretaries who come around every 3-4 years who desire to 'leave their mark' in some kind of sick vanity project. We need a health secretary who is willing to do the job for 20 years and deliver real, structural and sweeping reform, it is badly needed. And we can't just simply cover our eyes and ears and blindly throw money into the bottomless pit, that is what Labour did for 13 years and the health service budget doubled with almost no real improvement in care.

Rather than what we have now which is one side presenting reform and the other side kicking and screaming for years throwing their toys out of the pram shouting about 'privitisation' and resorting to rhetoric 'the envy of the world' 'the best of British' and scaremongering rather than actually having a meaningful debate. However I suspect this will not happen in a million years because the NHS is every party's political football that they use to get elected, demonstrated today as it is pretty much the only card the Labour party has to play at this election",null,0,null,1427828247,null,0,1427906933,0,cpwybds,null,t3_30x4wm,null,t1_cpwybds,null,t3_30x4wm,null,null,null,1432121132,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

So my issue the demonisation of decent, law abiding people who in the grand tradition of Britishness just go about their own business wihtout bothering anybody. That represents the vast body of British Muslims. When we demonise muslims and we demonise Islam we are also demonising decent people, and that is thoroughly unjust and imo runs entirely contrary to our society's values.

Muslims dont drink and dont eat pork and try to live wholesome lives, but they dont stop us from living how we like. The vast majority accept our way of life amd choose to live their lives slightly differently according to their religious beliefs.I can acept everyone isnt the same and Im perfectly fine with it because they arent imposing on my freedoms and they are entitled to live how they like as long as they abide by the law and dont bother anyone. Again the vast majority of British Muslims dont bother anyone, they do abide the law and the live fairly conservative lives. It cant be easy for kids growing up in our society and having all the temptations around them that they cant experience but they accept that, some go through a wild period in their twenties, ither remain more pious. Im okay with all of that. Im of the opinion they should be able to live how they choose to live without being constantly condemned by society. I was born in the seventies, for most of my life muslims were ignored they werent in the media and their faith wasnt an issue. The divisions are being created and personally I reject the demonisation of these british people because I dont want to live in a divided society, a soceity where children are growing up feeling they dont belong for no other reason than the religion their parents chose for them. We are storing up massive problems for the future because at some point they are naturally going to say fuck this, you hate me and I havent done anything wrong to you, I just happen to follow a religion.

Combo, oily to very oily skin may find they don't really need moisturizer, especially in the heat of summer or humid weather. Then again, some serums are more hydrating than others and some people may not feel the need to put on moisturizer.

i could go on and on and on, but it's kind of pointless. Sterlings quality in the final third is already proving to have gotten a lot better. he has 10 goals, with 9 games left to play, possibly up to 11/12 games. if he were to score 3-5 more goals, he would be on par with messi at the same age. quality of his play and impact on games is what counts and raheem is a pretty important piece to the puzzle...notice how well he played against lithuania, it's no coincedence he dazzled with a goal and great assist. 

that kind of fee is reserved for talents like raheem, and i have 0 doubt in my mind if we sold him, we could demand closer to 60m if he doesn't act like a twat in the process of being sold..now whether that happens this summer or not, i could not tell you because i left my crystal ball at home, but i will say that raheem will be worth nearly as much as bale in a few years. his end product is already getting a lot better, look at the quality of finishes since the turn of the year.

you do not need to convert, im very much from 'MURICA. but yeah i started hearing about him the summer after rodgers first season, and have been seeing us linked to him since then. we apparently had first right of refusal because of the wisdom loan, but who knows if that's true and also we loaned them ibe which helped them a lot until we yanked him back to our squad. will be interesting to see what happens because now that he is 20, there is no reason he shouldn't be looking for a premier league move. what i am wary about, when buying him for close to 10m, is that we have a lot of damn good talent in our academy without nearly as much senior level experience. we better make damn sure we don't spend 10m on a guy that we could have developed ourselves (aka rossiter, williams, brannagan, lussey, chiravella, adam phillips, marc pelosi). all of those guys have all been labeled the next big thing with us, and that doesn't even take into consideration that we have alberto and tex coming back this summer to duke it out for a spot on the squad. i would love nothing more than our academy to explode and produce an entire starting XI, or start producing 3-4m rated players and making profit off of those investments (which is highly more likely lol). our academy should be more like barca's in that players who make it to the senior squad are some of the best in the world and the players who don't get sold off for good sums of money. arteta, pepe, thiago, thiago motta, fontas, cuenca, bojan, muniesa, romeu, and the dos santos bros...that's a shit load of money they made on those guys! lfc can do it",null,0,null,1427831283,null,0,false,0,cpx0a3z,null,t3_30w1il,null,t1_cpx0a3z,null,t1_cpwyhyc,null,null,null,1432122068,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

So this seems to be the most popular idea.
We are but your humble servants and will of course make it happen.

I think the best approach would be to keep a sticky thread at the top of MotoUK which links directly to Motoukforsale. This will be a different colour and always be in the top spot.

Doing it this way would ensure that our Modteam doesn't have to manually add a list of links every day/week/month, but still takes people to the latest posts.

Most importantly though, if you have things to post, you need to do that now. It will do no good to put up the sticky now, getting people clicking through, only to find a single post from 3 months ago when it was started. 

It would be a bit like advertising your car dealership, only when people get there, they find just one car. People will not come back.

I will change the annouce message tonight to remind people to post things for sale there and bold the link in the sidebar too.

When it has some post traffic, if the mod over there messages us we can setup the sticky post to link directly to the main page there.

Thank you to ginger_ink for your post. Let's make this happen.

This became the idea of ""multiculturalism"" in that people should be able to keep elements of their own identity that works in conjunction with a larger British identity.

The issue has been looked at by both Blairs and Camerons governments and after promises to do something they did absolutely nothing.

The issue with tax avoidance isn't asking people for too much tax. It's that the tax system is too complex and avoidance is too easy. We should close loopholes, not pander to those unwilling to make a fair contribution to society.

So we saw the rise of New Labour and I don't think people would argue that for the first 3 years they did well. They made some really positive changes.

Another option is to decant into a spray bottle, again this makes products go much further.

A lot of female suspects are more emotional - not saying it's right but it's a lot harder to prove an emotional abusive situation when the victim doesn't want to cooperate (as the article explains some victims don't want help, or don't feel they can get help) whereas if you turn up at the scene to someone covered in blood you can kind of guess what happened.

My brushes haven't been this sparkly clean for a long time - it really helps to get down into the base of the bristles and get the make-up gunk out, and gets the suds out *so* much quicker. No more swirling brushes into the palm of your hand for ages to get them clear of the soap!

I guess all I'd say is I don't see your solution as any less complicated than mine. I think trying to raise wages so that people can afford to buy a home in this country's ludicrously inflated property market is going to be just as long and difficult a process as taking steps that will encourage house prices to fall.

And I wouldn't want to try and raise salaries by reducing taxation. I don't think it'd work for one thing. I think for a significant improvement to someone's income to occur through a tax reduction the drop in tax would have to be so substantial as to have a serious impact on public services. I also think reduced taxes disprortionately benefit those who earn more, which is counterproductive.

Taxes in this country are the lowest they've been in recent times. And the income figures you're quoting (£50k-£70k) would qualify someone as rich in my books. It'd put you in the top 90-95% of earners.

The problem isn't that we're earning too little. We're one of the wealthiest countries in the world. It's that for decades now we've been building too few houses. And so a lack of supply is driving up prices and rents. We have to accept the those who've bought homes in previous generations and have done well from it have done unfairly well because of the housing situation. And they may need to suffer through negative equity and a collapse in house prices. I think that's only reasonable if it means they get to keep their homes and others get a chance to be first time buyers. We just have to build more homes. Government schemes like Help to Buy are just making things worse, creating a short term opportunity, but ultimately inflating the housing bubble all the more.

Not quite sure what doctors know about the ins and outs of fraccing, that make them the authority on it.  But they are entitled to their opinion. 

Reading the report its seems to boil down ""we think these things are bad so we should ban it , sorry place a moratorium on it""

The points raised aren't necessarily Frac specific either.  Such as the extra traffic on the roads which could apply to any large construction project. 

It also complains about methane not being a clean fuel, which ignores the 12% reduction in greenhouse gasses that America has seen since 2007 coinciding with their own boom in shale gas .  

The alternative they will propose(I suspect) is to rely on a short term fantasy of renewable energy suddenly coming online. Fine in the long run but unrealistic as a way to shut down/reduce coal usage in the short term that gas power plants can do. 

I also disagree with the idea that just because something is potentially risky then we should never attempt to undertake it. No advances would ever be made esp in medicine with that attitude.  

In the case of fraccing it is about risk management and understanding how to mitigate against them.

He was also one of the first in our class to get web access at home and we already knew he'd been ""at it"" with regards to porn.  One day, he showed me online porn when I went round to his place.  This must have been around 15 years ago.

Thinking back to it, it was truly laughable by today's standards.  It was mostly photos hosted on ridiculously obvious and generic domains (fake but typical examples include *hotrussiangirls.com*, *amateurnudes.org* and so on), a few short grainy videos ""WITH SOUND!"" for the real savants and connoisseurs.  

The modern diet of a near unlimited choice of long videos hosted online for any fetish you can possibly imagine just didn't exist, was unheard of, didn't take off until broadband did.  Some modern porn sites don't even have a pictures section anymore and it's all videos.  Even as recently as 2001 a lot of curious teenagers were fapping to FHM and Loaded, or the real horny buggers were fapping to Mayfair magazine even though it was heavily censored.

2. *IF* you accept that the Muslim world is worse off than the non-Muslim world overall, in terms of repression, then the reason for that is very complex and not simply a case of ""Islam bad"".

It seems you find yourself now admitting that porn (along with many other things) is addictive. But rather than accept that you decide to set up a straw man in order to maintain an ideological stance against my point.

Lots of things are addictive, young people are more vulnerable to some, older people are more vulnerable to others. Some do more harm than others. Some require different interventions depending on age, seriousness etc... 

Had you perused that sub just a little, you may have found links that extend beyond 20,000 redditers with a porn addiction. Furthermore they're not advocating the banning of porn either, they're just finding like-minds and trying to support each other in getting over their addictions.

Does everyone really need to be so pro-porn that they show such contempt for anyone who isn't, religious or not? ",null,0,null,1427839591,null,0,false,0,cpx5jg2,null,t3_30whns,null,t1_cpx5jg2,null,t1_cpwn5m3,null,null,null,1432124546,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It needs to be planned in exacting detail and may riddle the countryside with haul roads (which protesters will hate).

Capitalism and libertarianism are one and the same.

Capitalism: an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit

Libertarian: One who advocates maximizing individual rights and minimizing the role of the state.

Furthermore you must consider that the agreements covers not just the UK, whose courts are relatively independent from executive influence, but also courts in countries like Romania whose courts most certainly aren't.  

On bias in the World Bank. Certainly it has its own agenda and issues in a variety of policy areas. However, its staff are certainly among the most expert and qualified people in the world to deal with trade disputes. Furthermore, the fact that the government in question in an ISDS gets to nominate one of the arbitrators who, along with the claimant's nominee, selects the third arbitrator means that it  is unlikely that your going to get the sort of sinister influence you imagine. If this is a potential possibility for whatever reasons there are two other respected organisations that offer arbitration.  

Finally I'd point out that your concerns the World Bank not having a declaratory commitment to anything beyond free trade is a non-issue in these cases. Contrary to what you may have heard the companies can only launch an ISDS complaint if they feel they have been unfairly discriminated against. Thus a government can regulate any industry however it wants provided that the regulation is not simply aimed at stifling foreign companies competition with national ones.

Sterling is looking for more money. Let's not forget he won the European golden boy award and is clearly one of the most talented youngsters in the world. I doubt he is asking for the £185/150k reported in the media. It's just them putting out shit so they will get clicks and views because people lap it up.

It's happened before and it won't be the last time agents look for a bit more money.

------------------------------------------------------------------

On 1 January 1983, upon the coming into force of the British Nationality Act 1981, every citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies became either a British citizen, British Dependent Territories citizen or British Overseas citizen.

Use of the term British subject was discontinued for all persons who fell into these categories, or who had a national citizenship of any other Commonwealth country. The category of British subjects now includes only those people formerly known as British subjects without citizenship and people born in Ireland before 1949.

This is why evidence based regulation is important, ban the drugs that are truly harmful and that people, if they knew the harm, wouldn't want to take anyway, the legalise the ones that aren't harmful and inform them of the harm that they could do in certain situations or long term effects, the actual risks. 

Currently the state of research on a lot of drugs is so primitive that the underlying trend of long term effects is hard to see and this is all because the government has hinder research on a subject that actively effects a large portion of the population.
