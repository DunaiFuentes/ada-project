There are mixed opinions on the ultimate benefit of it.  
My *personal* opinion is they depend a lot on other circumstances. The main one being: are you a driver? If so, and have a decent road awareness around you, it may be possible, as you already have a chunk of the learning acquired. Otherwise, a lot of different road experiences/situations need to be crammed in to a short period of time.

The issue is though, not everyone learns at the same speed - you may take to a bike like a duck to water. Or, you may struggle [like I did] with clutch control.  

As such, I'd recommend trying to get ad hoc lessons, giving you time to digest what you learn over a period of time rather than information overload.

I did a weird mix of both types. I initially started an ad hoc basis. Then, I moved home and found a place doing a fast pass system.  
If I had only done the fast pass, I'd never have gotten my licence.

Again: personal opinion.

Also, I don't like the rhetoric that we leave Lloris out to dry and that Lloris deserves better.  Lloris is back there to make good saves, and he does make mistakes.  On Sunday he didn't make a single save.

I've indexed the allowance,inflation and house price index vs 1986 levels, and this doesn't take into account the effective doubling of the allowance in ~2008 for married couples.

Honestly, allowances are pretty generous by historic standards, even though they haven't changed since 2009 in that they have almost doubled compared to the index.  They don't compare so generously to house price increases in London, though they are OK for my other example (SW England), but that probably is indicative of how broken the London housing market is rather than tax rates.

But the breath of fresh air comes from our ticket out of the catch 22 (need CL quality players to get CL &gt; need CL to get CL quality players). Barring a complete anomaly of a transfer window, the only way we're getting significant CL quality players is through youth. Big prospects like Alli see Mason and Bentaleb in the lineup and it becomes more likely they'll sign here. So even though Schneiderlin would improve upon Mason, I'd still say we don't need Schneiderlin - we should obviously still try for players like that but if they don't come we're not completely screwed like 2-3 years ago.

Sometimes starting a big name from the bench for a game is the type of kick start they need, and no one should have an immediate place on the team sheet simply because of who they are! 

Having said that I don't think this is the right course of action in this scenario for two main reasons. The first being (as many people have said themselves) the lack of another player in the current squad who can perform his role. Maybe if Mikel was fit at the moment starting with a pivot of Matic and him away at Hull could have been considered, then bring on a fired up Cesc with a point to prove later in the match. However even if Mikel was fit at the moment I'd say stick with Cesc in the starting XI seeing as we have an international break just round the corner, from which when everyone comes back you'd expect us to take it as a fresh start to hit the ground running and win the title!",null,0,null,1426608694,null,0,false,0,cphrnhd,null,t3_2zcwz4,null,t1_cphrnhd,null,t3_2zcwz4,null,null,null,1427810983,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

""Young boy has an iPhone, loses it on way back from Private School, whilst travelling with his nanny.""

 
""Injured arm from Skiing trip""


""School in Cadogan Square where fees are £5,600 a term.""


""he got off at Chelsea Town Hall with his nanny""


""A taxi driver noticed the distressed schoolboy and offered him a free lift"" - WTF?


"" kindly PCSO, part of Chelsea’s neighbourhood police team, came to their aid."" -WTF?


""She jumped in the cab and flagged down the bus in Sloane Street. "" - WTF?


""Luca, son of businessman Count Alessandro Guerrini-Maraldi and model and actress Catrina Skepper"" - OK...some more background on privilege 


""Mrs Skepper, a friend of Prince Andrew’s, was famous for starring in the Cadbury’s Flake adverts of the Eighties"" - privilege displayed again


""“It was such an amazing turn of events with everyone rallying together showing a great example of community spirit.”"" - This is the kicker. The pay off. It's them vs us - the rich have a nice community spirit with lots of poor people helping them out. We don't.

Again, Long and McCormack may be average but they're getting first team football. A player who sits on the bench gives teams little to evaluate much less assess in terms of value.

The survey was posted at 11:48.

Then at 15:02 we started getting bursts of many UKIP responses in a row. The vast majority of UKIP responses took place in the last hour. At this point we also started getting some very strange responses, like Lib Dems and Greens selecting ""out"" on the EU referendum option. There was also a dramatic increase in troll responses to the gender question at this time, such as ""dolphin"" and ""fuck you you leftie loon"".

So I think it's fair to say the survey has been rather inexpertly brigaded.

These two sentences are contradictory. First you say surpluses are not spent then you say they are spent by definition on debt/interest payments.

&gt;Any budget surplus by definition will be spent paying of debt/interest because if it was spent on anything else it would be included in the budget!

Is spending on interest and paying off debt not mentioned in the budget? 

It is normal to say surpluses can be used by governments to invest in the economy;

&gt;Being in a state of budget surplus is often viewed as positive, and in the case of governments, as a sign that the economy is healthy and the government is being run well. Some governments reward citizens in times of surplus by lowering tax rates, although this has been shown to be problematic because it can be difficult to balance the budget later. Others may use surpluses [to reinvest in people and communities.] (http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-budget-surplus.htm#didyouknowout)

[Using the Budget surplus...surplus can be used to fund government expenditure on infrastructure and the purchase of assets.] (http://hsc.csu.edu.au/economics/policies_mgt/2484/Topic4Tutorial3.html)

[Use state surplus to invest in Minnesota's future] (http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/294455161.html)

You may not think it is technically correct but everyone understands the meaning.

Germany's surplus income is not paying off the national debt - it is being used to invest (and that is a very straightforward thing to say that is not incorrect), the question you posed which you knew the answer to seems meaningless.

[It's explained here as well](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/compare-different-qualification-levels)

Essentially when taking on an apprentice I was asked if I wanted to take on a level 2, 3 or 4 apprentice and what my minimum age was. As there are special requirements for those under 18 I excluded them as it would cost too much to cover it.

Level 2 is GCSE grades A-C or a level 2 BTEC. Essentially I'd be taking on someone with absolutely no usable IT skills and would have a long lead time before they were productive. This would mean I could pay a small amount but I didn't see it as worth the investment. Also I was a bit concerned about taking on someone 18+ with only level 2 qualifications.

I was then given a list of level 3 candidates who had a mix of A levels but mainly BTEC but in generalist subjects.

So what I have at the moment is an apprentice doing a level 3 course covering modules like 'Software Fault Finding'.

The consulting period has been so long so far that developments in the US are leaving the field at a standstill. Two years ago if you had said space x would hit a barge with a rocket they were planning to reuse, you'd be called a crackpot.

I can only imagine what the state of the art will be by then, but I'm reasonably certain that it will look incredibly similar to today: spaceplanes, if in operation, will almost exclusively be for space tourism and real payloads will be launched by rocket for the very simple reason that objects designed to travel very fast in both  atmosphere and a vacuum will be prohibitively limited by their structural mass.

&gt;In France, it is estimated only 20,000 out of 20 million households pay their wealth tax, yielding only 0.04% of total wealth in France: as ineffective for revenue raising as for redistribution. Sweden used to have a form of wealth tax, but they abolished it in 2011. It raised only SKr4.5bn (£427m) from 2.5% of taxpayers, but was estimated to have driven SKr1,500bn (£142bn) out of the country. Fear of capital flight led the Italian PM Mario Monti to abandon plans for his wealth tax, despite the crisis that threatens his country. Both the Irish and Dutch governments cited capital flight as the principle reason for abolishing their wealth taxes as well. The evidence is that wealth taxes also deter entrepreneurs. Analysis of four countries that abolished wealth taxes increased self-employment by up to 0.5 percentage points.",null,0,null,1426614573,null,0,false,0,cphvbf4,null,t3_2zby5i,null,t1_cphvbf4,null,t1_cphsm6c,null,null,null,1427812808,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

""I have been *at university* for three years"" (it's not important which university, and 'a' is implied - here saying ""been at a university"" or ""been at the university"" have different meanings). 

Equally, *in hospital* tends to refer to the state that you're in (that of being in a hospital) with the indefinite article implicit, as it doesn't need to be stressed. 

To show you the different meanings, consider the sentence (in order of precision):

I went to school in London. (generally with no precision as to which school)

I went to a CoE school in London. (I would use 'a' with an attribute, as there is more than one Church of England school in London - saying ""the CoE school"" would imply there was only one - and so I'm being most precise with the attribute rather than the school itself). Other examples: I went to a big school in London, I went to a grammar school in London.

I went to the Merchant Taylor's school in London. (precision is needed to state a certain school in particular)

To go back to your original example, compare ""I've only been in hospital twice"" (I have never been in hospital apart from those two times), ""I've only been in a private hospital twice"" (I may have been in other, non-private hospitals) and ""I've only been in Great Ormond Street Hospital twice"" (I may have been in other hospitals other than GOSH).

Starting from the 19th century, the term was often used, in a taxonomic sense, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.[4][5][6]

&gt; Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies[7] that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete,[8] and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.[9][10][11][12][13]

You could offer to pay one month as you would have had to give them one month's notice anyway. If they refuse then say you'd like to go through their formal appeals procedure and then make clear you'll be going to ofcom and an ombudsman if that is rejected. It's in their interest to resolve it without that happening as the costs of an ombudsman are fairly high. Essentially, make the offer of paying for 1 month as a means of resolving it quickly or make clear you're going to be as much of a pain as possible.

But to label him as being like ISIS is pretty harsh and certainly can't be supported by his Confession or his letter to Coroticus.

null,false,redindh,null,null,null,"The problem I think is that people in the West particularly the UK, the US and France have no idea how our countries are perceived abroad. We have also whitewashed our history and ignored the real impact we've had on other countries. In this country we  like to think of ourselves an Island nation that punches above it's weight but a small country. A nation of upstanding decent people.

You know how others perceive us? A big and powerful country that can't truly be trusted. A wily nation that will hug you one day and stab you the next. 

The Chinese have little trust in foreigners especially Western countries. We don't remember the bad things that happened. The fact that there were parks in Shanghai that Dogs and Chinese people were banned from is widely remembered over there. The fact of the matter is that the relationship with China was really bad until they started to become more economically powerful. That is recent history.Many of the men who have influence and power now actually grew up in an era where bad relations with the West was common. 

Every time a western country meets the Dalai Lama or starts talking about Tibet, it only rings alarm bells. It fuels their paranoia about us. The country isn't fully developed and they perceive themselves as weak compared to us.

It's also hypocritical for Western countries to talk about human rights when they help their allies widely evade. When our leaders talk about it no one takes it seriously. If our leaders truly cared they would ask countries that China trusts. If the Pakistani PM or the Russian President talked to China about Tibet it would go a long way. The Chinese don't think Pakistan or Russia is seeking to undermine them.

Also I forget to mention previously. Hong Kong isn't truly democratic that is obvious. It never was and it never will be. Under British rule the place was ruled by Britain. Local Chinese people who made up the vast majority of people had no say. All they did was take orders.

The reason why Hong Kongers are upset is because the place is rich compared to the rest of China. Thousands of mainlanders are coming everyday. Mothers to give birth. People who buy baby milk and other products to sell in Guangdong. Tourists from the countryside with bad manners. You know like pissing and spitting everywhere.

Once the mainland catches up with HK the place will be nothing special. Guangdong Province will probably have an economy bigger than all of the UK in a few years and still grow fast.",null,0,null,1426618061,null,0,false,0,cphxi9h,null,t3_2yvlcp,null,t1_cphxi9h,null,t1_cphugol,null,null,null,1427813831,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

And to be honest, it contains a lot of tosh and scaremongering, all of which is already considered and mitigated against in conceptual works. It is a shame, as most of their CSci videos are good, but this one isn't, at all.

Let's look at the relevant parts...

&gt;It can take about as much to change one vote as it does to change a million.

This is completely dependent on the method of voting, storage, and verification. While it may seem as simple as updating a database table... it doesn't have to be. For example, if fields could not be changed without 2FA and therefore if each vote required SMS verification against the registered mobile, and the mobile number couldn't be changed. If there were regional servers dependant upon IP. If there were only certain access windows. If there were throughput limits per address... etcetc.

&gt;Can be done without setting foot in the country

Indeed. But should we be defending against this anyway? We can prevent direct external traffic if required, but this won't prevent externally controlled internal traffic (proxies). However provided the vote is tied to an individual, this isn't an issue.

&gt;Anonymity 

If we want to keep it for voting electronically, there is no reason we can't. After the vote is cast, give it a unique ID which goes back to the person (if they want it). And strip any other ID in the record. Not a problem.

&gt;You never trust any individual (with manual voting)

Except you do. Lots of them. Hundreds of them. The same will occur with the online system - you have to trust the designers and the maintainers. In the manual system you trust the counters and all the volunteers. 

&gt;Ensuring the software is what you think it is

In online voting this would be a website or program. And yes, verification would be difficult. However there could, for example, be applications/devices to verify the destination is as intended. But some user education will be required, admittedly.

To draw an analogy, in manual voting, it would not be difficult to say, set up a fake polling station.

&gt;Man in the middle attack

Verified destination + Secure connection + User education.

&gt;XSS

Sanitise inputs and outputs. Problem solved.

&gt;Machines are infected

Yes. And ultimately, this is the hardest issue to solve. However using multiple factors mitigates the likelihood of infection compromising a single vote. Vote online. Confirm by mobile-app/sms/call.

All of these issues, are addressable. Some of these issues when addressed make for a better system than we have presently. And yet, in all of that the biggest threat wasn't even mentioned. Disrupting availability.

&gt;Nationstates are powerful. If they can attack centrifuges, they can attack voting.

It is a bit of a false equivalency. The attack vectors are not the same. The defences are not the same. Yes attacking the voting system would be possible. But attacking the current one is equally possible. Both can be monitored for unusual activity. Both can have effective mitigations.

Yes. There are dangers in online voting. But these are things to be mitigated. Not reasons to prevent it.",null,0,null,1426618749,null,0,false,0,cphxy5v,null,t3_2zcjal,null,t1_cphxy5v,null,t1_cphrwo4,null,null,null,1427814037,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I don't watch Top Gear for the very reason you stated but seeing as I chip in for the TV license, my money is being spent on that fucking show, so before I even continue with my complete disagreement with you, I think you would agree I have every right to comment on what the money is spent on.

But continuing, even if it was a private channel, are you telling me you would take the same stance with, I dunno, a hypothetical program called Top Jihadi, in which a wahabbi nutter complains about another advancement in knowledge or science. No I don't think you would would you, BECAUSE what's in the public domain is completely open to public scrutiny and debate. I hate that argument so much, tis petty as fuck, ""you don't like it, don't do it"" as if Clarkson and his stupid views operate in a vacuum which is completely distinguishable from the rest of society and public opinion.

Even if they decide against you, you will normally always have a month or so to pay it off and not have the CCJ registered against you.

All that to one side though, the contract seems to be contradicting itself. Why would you need to pay any money until they have found someone? Your contact is 6 months. You've given them notice with plenty of time - simply stop paying on your notice date.

The real question is the 20% in the 3 months you have left. It should be a simple case of you pay 20% as a penalty fee, or you have to pay the full amount of your contract.
Why would you have to pay 20% *and* find someone else - their estate agents, that's their jobs. If what you're saying is accurate, it sounds like an unfair contract and that alone won't go down well in court.

The estimated 1400 victims of abuse in Rotherham includes people like Forrest and /u/smashing3000 ""chasing after a 30 year old"". 

I think the Rotherham figure has been widely misunderstood - it includes at least a good number of girls who considered these guys as ""boyfriends"" at the time, who were known to police and social services as the girls' ""older boyfriend"".

The social services have been criticised for not intervening, but I'm pretty sure many of them realised the futility of trying to stop a teenage girl from seeing her boyfriend.

Read the Rotherham report for yourself - search the [PDF](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/401125/46966_Report_of_Inspection_of_Rotherham_WEB.pdf) for the number ""1400"", and read where CSE is defined in it.

While true that people can spend more, it still wouldn't work, mininum wage can and should rise, but there is definitely a limit. Say you were originally earning £10/hour and it is increased to £1000, a 100x increase would need to be paid for somehow. Consider somewhere that may actually pay close to the minimum wage, such as a supermarket. Even if everybody now spends freely there, nobody needs 100x their original purchases. For the business to cover the wage rise without taking a dip in profit, people would have to spend 100x more on each trip, but nobody would buy 100 loaves of bread in place of one, so the price of each loaf would have to increase to cover the difference. Hell, even if they did decide to increase purchasing proportionately, it would create logistical problems - shelving wouldn't hold enough stock to support the increase in demand, so extra staff would be required to restock constantly, creating further increases in staffing expenses. And ultimately the benefit to the employee would be marginal given they'd be spending close to 100x more on everyday items, they wouldn't see the benefit of the wage rise either.

We royally screwed over Africa, but that shouldn't stop us from calling certain African nations out on things like corruption, torture and war crimes. Just because our ancestors did horrible things to another people's ancestors doesn't make their descendants immune from criticism by us. 

Of course, when Western political leaders do this it comes across as being hypocritical (realpolitk's a bitch) but we in the West do have our values- Liberalism, human rights, democracy, self-determination etc- Most political leaders in the West try to maintain these values but the world we live in makes that very difficult, and indeed many leaders fail to uphold them or disregard them entirely. But that doesn't invalidate us (and by us I mean everyone) from criticising China over Tibet, Hong Kong, state censorship, pollution etc. Opinion over what is right and wrong doesn't stop at China's national border. 

For these reasons I think it's perfectly justified to criticise China for interfering in Hong Kong and supporting democracy activists there, or calling out their government on its handling of the Tibetian protests and state censorship.It may make some people in China feel uncomfortable, but nobody should have to silence themselves because their political opinions might cause offence.

RIPA is not relevant here. It's a common misconception online when it comes to private calls between people. RIPA prohibits interception by a *third party*, it's not related to the two end users making the call directly in this context.

I hate quoting Wikipedia here, but the references are sourced, so it'll do: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_recording_laws#United_Kingdom


&gt;The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 in general prohibits interception of communications by a third party, with exceptions related to government agencies. A recording made by one party to a phone call or e-mail without notifying the other is not prohibited provided that the recording is for their own use; recording without notification is prohibited where some of the contents of the communication—a phone conversation or an e-mail—are made available to a third party.

It's usable in court, provided the judge agrees it's relevant to the case. There are plenty of recent cases that have telephone evidence in, even when one person didn't know the call was being recorded.

Here's a quick quote from an actual lawyers website: http://www.acitylawfirm.co.uk/recorded-conversations

&gt; Person to Person

&gt;Between two private individuals it is not prohibited to record conversations.  The problem arises however if that conversation is then provided to a third party for whatever reason, without the consent of both parties. Consent can be obtained retrospectively or argued to be within the public’s interest.  As an example, reporters frequently record conversations covertly, but their defence is that the content is in the public’s interest and should be disclosed; in that knowledge of the recording would alter the content of the conversation significantly.  A thin line is trodden here and many court battles have ensued to determine what is and what is not considered in the public’s interest.  Injunctions are the most effective option available to the recorded individual who believes recordings have been made without consent, along with any claims for damages flowing from it.

Given that there isn't a third party involved (apart from the court), it's down to them to decide if it's usable or not.

Recording the conversation and sticking it on Youtube however.....

The entire field has a lot of misquotes online, which makes things a bit muddy sometimes.
There is a decent page here that outlines lots of the things people need to know about recording calls: http://www.solidstatesound.co.uk/html-b/Telephone_rec_legal.htm
The relevant bits are:

&gt;Can I record telephone conversations on my home phone?

&gt;Yes. The relevant law, RIPA, does not prohibit individuals from recording their own communications provided that the recording is for their own use. Recording or monitoring are only prohibited where some of the contents of the communication - which can be a phone conversation or an e-mail - are made available to a third party, i.e. someone who was neither the caller or sender nor the intended recipient of the original communication. For further information see the Home Office website where RIPA is posted.

&gt;Do I have to let people know that I intend to record their telephone conversations with me?

&gt;No, provided you are not intending to make the contents of the communication available to a third party. If you are you will need the consent of the person you are recording.


On the CCJ front though:
&gt;I'm aware that he can pay and still get the CCJ, however it's extremely unlikely to be awarded against him if he pays before he goes to court.

That's not what I mean. You can get a CCJ against you (you lose the case), pay after this (say a few months) and settle the debt, but you *still* have the CCJ against you. It's marked as 'settled' but it still causes hell when you're trying to do anything financial :(
I was just trying to point out this, as the bit I quoted makes it sound like you'll only get a CCJ if you lost *and* you refused to pay, which sadly isn't the case.

null,false,SkyPilotOne,null,null,null,"There are two different numbers, for London and the rest of the UK.
The London Living Wage:
&gt;Since 2006 the GLA Group has been implementing the London Living Wage (LLW). The Group continues to
include the LLW as a requirement for contracts that are let or renewed. This year, the number of accredited
London Living Wage employers has doubled, to a total of over 400 and the Mayor continues to lobby
national Government to adopt the London Living Wage across Whitehall.


&gt;As previously we calculate the Living Wage by a combination of two approaches. The
first, developed by the Family Budget Unit (FBU),
1 estimates the costs of a ‘Low Cost but Acceptable’ (LCA) budget for a selection of households and calculates the wage required to meet these costs. This is termed the “Basic
Living Costs” approach. The second – the “Income Distribution” approach – calculates the wage required
for 11 household types in London (appropriately weighted) to attain an income equivalent to 60 per cent of
the median income for London, with that median ‘equivalised’, that is, adjusted appropriately to reflect the
household type.


&gt;This year, the Basic Living Costs approach yields an hourly wage of £7.65 per hour and the Income
Distribution approach one of £8.25.
The average of these two wages (called the “poverty threshold wage”) is £7.95 per hour.
In order to protect against unforeseen events a margin of 15 per cent is added to the poverty threshold wage. This gives a figure of £9.15 per hour (when rounded to the nearest
five pence) as the London Living
Wage. 

[
Full Report;pdf warning](http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/living-wage-2014.pdf)

And for the out of London rate:
&gt;The following
calculations start by calculating minimum living costs in 201
4
, then
translate that into a wage requirement, and finally consider the application of a
‘
cap
’
limiting the increase in an applied living wage in any one year.

I don't *need* that money. I have a career, and money of my own that I have worked for. It's profoundly unfair that I should have that extra. It's the very definition of unearned wealth.

Inheritance tends to make inequality worse. Rich people pass on their wealth to their children, who have already had more opportunities in life than the children of the poor. Take an example that seems to be very close to this subreddit's heart: housing. Wealthy pensioners own their own homes, and increasingly, are buying to let too. If they pass on all that property to their children, then it won't go back on the market. House prices go up, and deserving young people are priced out of the market.

Inequality is a serious social problem. We *have* to get a grip on it, or it will start to undermine the very stability of our society.

Personally, I don't want to be rich, if it means I have to pay people to protect me from the poor. And that's what's coming, if we don't get a grip on inequality.

null,false,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,null,"If I understand correctly, you have 3m remaining on your lease. For arguments sake lets say you pay £1,000pm. Your lease says you need to pay the remaining 3m unless they find someone sooner (so up to £3,000). 

Again if I understand correctly (?) the agency has made an offer which would entail you paying (20% x 3m*£1,000) = £600 to break the lease early i.e. you vacating now, you waiving your right to have your liability reduced if they find a replacement but they waive their right to up to £3,000.

If this is correct, then they are offering to vary the terms of contract for a payment. I'm not sure about domestic letting rules, but otherwise this is very normal, certainly in commercial land contracts and also common with consumers e.g. mobile phone contracts.  

Now on to the bit about you advertising the flat... It's not your flat to advertise, you're not entitled to do this. The agency will be wary about potentially being bound by the unauthorised advert, and also of agreeing to let it to them when you are not yet formally obliged to vacate. Yes it's shitty and not very pragmatic on their part but you're screwed because you don't have this right legally.

The interest does imply that the agency should be able to quickly re-let the flat and this may influence your decision choosing between the safe £600 or the risky £0-£3,000. Bear in mind however 20%x3 months = about 18 days; if you decide to risk it then you'll come out in front only if they get someone moved in within ~18 days of you vacating. 

OK so if you aren't vacating until the 31st or something that's 14 days on top of the 18 above, so they'd have 32 days to get a new tenant in before the risky option would start being a loser. Sounds OK but you'd still only break even with the 20% option if they get someone *immediately* but he needs a month's notice - I don't know about where you are but where I like a month's notice is pretty much a given, so here you'd be almost guaranteed to be losing if you didn't take the option. Even if they actually find someone able to move ASAP they would probably take a week after you vacate just for inspections, cleaning etc and that would already be 7/30days x £1000 = £233ish, so realistically the very best case scenario for the risky choice still costs you £200 and hence IMHO the potential gain doesn't seem all that high given the level of risk. 

Maybe they'll also take the opportunity to bump up the price or just be dicks and take it a bit slow since they got someone paying anyway - yeah it'd be unethical but we are talking about letting agents here... 

There's also the issue of the deposit, might they be dicks about that? You may be able to negotiate to use your deposit against the 20% payment and them pay you the rest, therefore guaranteeing getting your deposit back.",null,0,null,1426624918,null,0,false,0,cpi1x6c,null,t3_2zcy9g,null,t1_cpi1x6c,null,t3_2zcy9g,null,null,null,1427815889,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Labour was knocked off it's pedestal in Scotland in 2007 when the SNP formed a minority government in Holyrood and they only fell further from there. I don't know how much non-Scots know about the fate of Scottish Labour since then, fair to say they've shot themselves in the foot more times than I can even remember and gone through leaders like it was going out of fashion. They've only just gone and got a new one after their most recent leader resigned after the referendum, complaining of Scottish Labour being treated like a ""branch office"" by London HQ.


Yes thats right, the leader of Scottish Labour during the referendum campaign resigned following the result because of something the SNP have been accusing Labour of for many years. And as we've come to expect from Labour in Scotland, they didn't use this as an opportunity to refresh the party, they simply denied what their former leader claimed and elected Jim Murphy, an MP who has never been involved in the Scottish Parliament.


So hopefully I've explained why Labour has such dismal support in Scotland now. However, their Westminster results have been shielded from this because it was seen as a wasted vote to vote for the SNP in anything other than the handful of northern seats they have won before. Labour was who you voted for because you don't like the Conservatives and that was that, anything else was a wasteful at best or risky at worst.


However, since the referendum there has been a massive surge in SNP membership and there has been a sort of political awakening amongst the public. The No vote won but Yes got 45% of the vote. Now a massive amount of that 45% will have been SNP Holyrood Voters who voted Labour nationally, but after enduring such a hard fought referendum campaign it's too bitter a thought to give your vote to Labour again, well that's one explanation.


There are plenty of other reasons, such as the opinion polls themselves have made voters realise an SNP vote nationally isn't a wasted vote after all. Suffice to say the aftermath of the referendum, for many reasons, removed the barrier that has been shielding Labour in Westminster elections and artificially inflating their General Election numbers in Scotland since 2007.",null,0,null,1426625051,null,0,1426625399,0,cpi206o,null,t3_2zdyiy,null,t1_cpi206o,null,t3_2zdyiy,null,null,null,1427815928,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,swedishchef2014,null,null,null,"My thoughts:
1) Fees: Unless you stick to a providers SVR after your initial deal ends, then you'll be paying fees to book new deals every few years or so. You can reduce the fee by locking in for a longer term, but that reduces your flexibility. Perhaps an offset mortgage gets around that? Others can hopefully confirm on this.
2) Lenders are wise to low variable rates. That era is over. A 40 year mortgage on base + 0.5% or similar might be a great move (depending upon your attitude to risk) but with today's SVRs of base + ~3-4% it's a different ball game.
3) 40 years is a long time and your circumstances can easily change. When you're older there's a good chance you'll be itching to pay off the financial ball and chain. Consider the emotional aspect as well as the financial. 
4) I suppose that if you expect to receive an inheritance, or build up to a large income, and you assume that inflation will be high on average over the period, and you assume that you'll be able to make all the payments, and you are healthy enough to work for 40 years longer, and you assume that interest rates won't be crippling, and you get a/some good deal(s) over the course of the mortgage then a 40 year committment might be a good idea. That's a lot of if's.

The value created is worth less than the average British person would be paid for the effort. That is precisely why manufacturing has nearly universally moved to an area where people's time is worth less.

The financial sector is about the same size as our manufacturing sector. Neither are growth areas. Growth in the UK is coming from services and the creative industries. Services in particular has huge value because services tend to save British people time and we've already demonstrated that a British hour is worth a fair amount.

This big increase in the worth of the British man hour is why we've seen this transition. To reverse it we'd have to reduce the value of the British man hour so it is worth less than refining steel.

null,false,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; The principle is as fair as it can get. You're taking money from someone who can't use it any more.

That isn't fair. If you have an accident and can never move your limbs again, would you be ok with HMRC coming to take your car? You can't use it anymore and I'm sure there are deserving people who could use it. Isn't it fair to redistribute your wealth without taking account of your wishes, as you are incapable?

&gt; Don't know what this is supposed to mean but it is proportional. There's a tax exempt amount above which the tax applies. If you transfer the inheritance before death then as long as you do it soon enough, the tax reduces to zero.

* IHT was created to break up the estates of aristocrats. It was not meant to affect the middle class or even the upper middle class. The fact it does shows it isn't fit for purpose, it's failing to hit the super rich who have no stake in this country and hitting the middle class who do have a stake in this country.
* The fact you can get out of it by disposing of your wealth through gifts before you die is patently absurd and counterproductive. It effectively allows those with knowledge of the law or sufficient wealth to hire someone with knowledge of the law to get round it. What kind of example is that? Another loophole those who create the laws can use while everyone else gets screwed. Another pound in the pocket of a tax lawyer or accountant.
* It takes no account of regional differences in house prices. The cutoff point may be able to buy you a mansion in Easington-on-Sea but nobody wants to live there. It punishes those with the misfortune to invest in a home in the south of the country who then die.

Look - it's easy to rail against everyone who is better off than you as not deserving it. But really there are levels. A million quid won't get you far in some parts of this country, and that's where you are likeliest to have estates worth over a million quid. Some of those people are the very same people who work 80 hours a week and build a business from the ground up.

I have most of those foods you have listed in there, my £5 a day is normally coming from the following:
£1 500g greek style yoghurt ( reasonable protein just some small amount of sugar and high fat)

£2 Half a whole chicken

£0.25 Whole meal bread rolls

£1 Fruit - I always spend £1 on two bananas, an apple and an orange

&lt;£1 on Frozen veg and peanut butter/protein powder, potentially more if I am using instant oats. And potatoes/rice depending on my mood

So most of my cost is coming from eating such a large amount of chicken, I guess I should try substituting some of that chicken with beans, The greek style yoghurt as been so handy in my bulk, and I really don't think I can give that up.

I know vitamin wise, I am easily okay with not eating fruit. But generally I feel my energy levels and mood is a bit better having some sugar from fruit.

Myprotein.com is a life saver if you haven't used it.


Thank god my bulk will soon be over, and I will be able to drop a lot of the food I eat.

I appreciate you're on a phone, but this is covered in the links I provided. Namely:

&gt;There is no clear answer in this area of law, but the basic principles of obtaining consent for recordings is one that everyone should follow the guidance and if you haven’t and want to rely on it, yes you probably can, but be aware of the risks involved.

The court can consider **any** evidence it wants as admissible. It has the *power* to do this. You can literally bring *anything* you want as evidence to court, and the judge will decide if it's admissible or not.
The court is certainly *not* a third party in the context of the law. It's the *enforcer* of the law. They are vastly different things.

If what you're claiming was true, you could simply put clauses in contracts that 'no third party is allowed to handle disputes', effectively writing the court out of the ability to enforce the contract.
Of course, that is absurd, but it illustrates well why the court is a totally independent body. Heck, you can see this alone in how different courts come to difference decisions with the same evidence! :)

I think there's a difference between a comedian who explores our fears regarding the taboos surrounding racial terms and someone who is actively getting his audience to laugh along with racist jokes.

Let's ignore Clarkson for the moment and look at other comedians.  Joan Rivers would be an excellent example.  She was a comedian whose whole act comprised of jokes which go ever the edge of what's normally acceptable.  But it would be missing the point to think she was actually being racist, homophobic, sexist, etc.  It would be taking her comedy at absolute face value, when its whole intent was ironic.  She wasn't 'dog whistling' her secret hatred of homosexuals.  Rather, she was able to get away with telling jokes at the expense of gays, because everyone knew that she supported them 100%.  In fact, they were her biggest fans.  

And I think it's really worrying that people are beginning to apply politically correct litmus tests to comedy and trying to restrict what can or can't be joked about.  Because comedy can *never* be made safe and comedians have always been interested in identifying the boundaries of good taste and then crossing them.

OK then, so which camp is Clarkson in?  Is he someone who's actually racist and who wants us to laugh along with him in his contempt of other races?  Or is he merely making comedy out of exploring taboos, like so many other comedians before him?  

And I don't know.  Beyond a few youtube clips, I haven't watched Top Gear and I simply don't know enough about Clarkson to make the call.  But I think that everyone should take a step back and realize that their feelings about Clarkson might just be a matter of taste.  That comedy is to a very very large extent subjective.  And that just because something may be over the line as far as you're concerned, that other people may see things differently.

It depends on what returns you think you can get and whether you think you can beat the returns offered by pension index funds.

---

I'm not even relying on the state pension being a thing by the time I retire, and even if it  does still exist chances are you probably won't get it until you're 80 odd.

Private pensions are all well and good, but you often can't draw on them early if you come down with something that will significantly shorten your life expectancy, in which case you've wasted all your savings. Pension annuities are also a joke but thankfully the current government are giving people other options (however, whether folks are capable of being trustworthy enough to manage their own pension funds without overspending is yet to be seen).

Personally all my savings are going into property. I'm currently converting an old barn into a new house and converting some derelict buildings into workshop units.

* More choice in the investments within a pension - especially SIPPs. ISAs still need to be accessible, e.g. you can't tie it up in commercial property. 

* Pensions can avoid NICs if using a net pay agreement.

* Can still claim certain benefits using a net pay method of paying into a pension - as it reduces pensionable pay. Particularly relevant is child benefit if close to earning 50k per year. It can also be effectively used if you are earning 100-120k a year to reduce your pensionable pay below 100k (to avoid the 60% personal allowance trap). 

* Paying into a pension could be considered a 'delayed tax'. If the same rules apply when you retire - Tax relief when paying in, but taxed when its taken out in the future. Arguably you get a 25% reduction because of the PCLS (tax free lump sum). However you are still effectively taxed at the end on any gains made within the fund as income. If invested in an ISA any returns would be tax free. 

* Pensions enforces 'savers discipline', as you cannot access your money - you cannot spend it!

Might seem like arguing semantics, but in principle it is fundamentally the same thing as ""benefits"", the only reason we tend to consider them separately is that there's no restriction like means-testing, really it's kind of arbitrary.  

If, for some pointless exercise in bureaucracy, they decided to make state schools charge fees but every kid gets a credit equating to their fee, and NHS treatment require insurance but every person gets a credit equating to their premium, suddenly we'd be calling them benefits. You'd also be getting folk who currently whine about scroungers having to admit they get &gt;£1,000 per month (article on the news today seemed to suggest its £5-8k per kid per year) benefit because they have two kids going to school. Plus whatever them and their two kids would cost in medical insurance with NHS-level of cover. 

The current benefits + public services system effects really quite a large transfer of incomes. A minimum wage which you can't live on seems daft to me, and the proposed living wage much more sensible, but the indirect benefits / subsidy would still be happening. The subsidy effect is also just a side effect of a transfer of wealth from rich to poor, which I think we all agree is a good thing - ideally not necessary of course, but I really cannot see an uplift in minimum wage to any level changing that, it's not just people with low paid workers who get rich.

If you come from a disadvantaged background you're greatest chance of upward mobility is through earning decent money and not getting punitively taxed on it. An income tax is a a direct tax on upward mobility. 

I never said people shouldn't be taxed or that the rich shouldn't be taxed more. 

What I'm saying is that no one gets rich off a salary they make it through owning assets and avoiding tax that way. I'm paying far less tax now than I did as a 27 year old at Goldman working far harder and that's the point you completely miss. 

Seriously this is the problem with the debate. You dont even understand how people make money. 

No one makes serious money through their salary. You build a base, buy assets and avoid income taxes. ",null,0,null,1426630149,null,0,false,0,cpi55v9,null,t3_2zcvkh,null,t1_cpi55v9,null,t1_cpi4wuw,null,null,null,1427817488,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

And yet, for the rest of the campaign we have played mediocre football, bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League meekly, been defensively shambolic, and relied on late goals from our two best outfield players to rescue us time and time again, often when we've hardly deserved it.

As much as people are lauding the use of young players, Poch is not really doing anything that Sherwood wasn't last season.  Kane started getting game time not because he's brilliant on his own, but because of the round failure of Ade and Soldado to do anything other than look foolish.  Same goes for Mason... no one else is putting their hand up for selection in his position.

Poch's signings other than Dier have largely been a waste of money, and he's not really wrung much more use out of the Bale signings than anyone else did.

Other than a bright uptick in form over the new year, we're playing just as poorly now as we did when he first took over.  Our defence is poor and our attack is unimaginative.

This has nothing to do with the Utd performance... it's a sober reflection of an underwhelming season, and to be fair, I've been saying these same things for months.

electorate As such, we do not consider that party membership totals would be a
robust indicator of wider support for the various parties across the electorate at large

On media coverage, they said:
&gt;Finally, we also consider that it would be inappropriate to take account, as
some respondents argued, of the lower levels of media coverage received by
some parties. In our view, levels of media coverage would not be a
straightforward variable to quantify and it is debatable the extent to which
coverage across all forms of media would easily correlate with levels of
support with the different parties.

and
&gt;Many respondents who opposed our proposal to designate UKIP as a major party in
England and Wales did so based on the perceived nature of this party and its policies,
and a perception that UKIP had received a disproportionate amount of media coverage.
We do not consider these to be relevant considerations for the purposes of our decision.

To get there, after work, I started to walk through Hyde Park as the sun was going down. It soon dawned on me how few people were about. Everywhere I looked was only parkland, trees, grass, and all I could hear was the burbling waters of the Serpentine.

I thought how lucky I was to be in this oasis of calm and of nature and of tranquility in the midst of the hustle and bustle of one of the world's great Capital cities.

Still, it was getting cold and dark so I pressed on. 

About 10 minutes later I got to the Albert Memorial and realised why there were so few people about... The park was locked. I was in a suit so couldn't jump the waist height fences. 

I had to walk for bloody miles to get to a gap in the fence to escape and then leg it to the Albert hall to arrive all sweaty and 'orrible.

null,false,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,null,"Here's the answer to that. Before the right-to-buy, people who moved into a council house were likely to live in it for the rest of their lives, thus removing that social housing from the market for decades.

Many of those tenants would also see their earnings increase over their working lives, often to the point where they shouldn't be tying up social housing. But it's their home, so apparently you can't tell them to fuck off in order to give the house to a needier tenant.

Also, the working classes lost much of their earnings in a lifetime of rent, with little money to pass on to their children, unlike the middle classes who could afford to buy. The advantages of a mortgage are that the mortgage becomes cheaper as inflation erodes the scale of the debt, you eventually get to live in a house without paying anything at all, and you also get to leave the house to the kids, giving them an economic leg-up.

The right to buy solves that problem (or should have done). If a tenant is going to tie up a council house for decades, sell it to them and use the proceeds to build a new home, instead of using taxpayers money to subside not only a new house for a low earner, but also to continue subsidising the existing house when that tenant can often afford to buy anyway.

So the right-to-buy would give the working classes the same advantages of buying that the Middle classes had.

The right to buy was originally a Labour policy for the reasons above. It was also a logical Conservative policy (less dependency on the state, lower cost to the taxpayer, allowing the individual the right to choose how they want to live and invest their earnings). 

Sadly, when the Conservatives introduced the Bill to Parliament in 1979, the Labour opposition introduced an amendment that prevented the Government from compelling local authorities to use the proceeds from council house sales to build new council houses. Labour's argument was that national government shouldn't be able to tell local government how to spend its money.

So guess what? Very few local authorities invested in new social housing.",null,0,null,1426632230,null,0,1426633393,0,cpi6d7p,null,t3_2zd6px,null,t1_cpi6d7p,null,t1_cpi1x1k,null,null,null,1427818049,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

If we were looking into freedom of movement with Australia on the basis of economic ties, then freedom of movement with Japan, Russia and the US (for example) would make more sense. 

That only leaves cultural reasons for wanting freedom of movement with Australia, but that would also suggest that freedom of movement should exist within much of the EU, given the depth of cultural ties between European countries. More importantly I feel, freedom of movement becomes rather pointless if looked at on the basis of cultural compatibility.

Yea I know that, I think you're right to a degree, offense is an emotional reaction (CERTAINLY NOT A CHOICE), and you cannot legislate those scenarios. 

I do agree with the Equality Act 2010, and with discrimination laws, especially around inciting hatred. 
But offense cannot be completely avoided, and sometimes I think it is healthy to develop and overcome boundaries and establish mutual understanding.

But don't think for a second any of that applies to Clarkson, I don't think he should be jailed or punished for most of his comments but I think the idea of him, or at least his apologists and defenders, using any argument about freedom of speech to justify his meaningless, unimportant, yet highly provocative and offensive statements, is just as pathetic as playing a race card.

Now, as for 

&gt;Pretty much. Lighten up

I don't know what to say to this apart from commentating on your clearly narrowminded relentless subjective view point. You have no right to tell someone what they can or cannot be offended by, so the idea of saying ""lighten up"" is really quite a selfish view to take.

For one, I could not sit here and say ""Poch's signings other than Dier have largely been a waste of money,"" because I would not say Ben Davies was a waste of money. We needed another left back, that was absolutely certain, and we bought a young player who has time to progress. Whether Rose's improvement is because of that signing or not, or whether you value Davies or not, hell look at it any way you want, but our LB position has improved from the situation we were in last year. As well, we needed a backup keeper, and Vorm made sense. Whether you rate Stambouli or Fazio, or whether they've panned out how we wanted to or not, alright. But, if you really break it down in terms of market, needs, and possibilities, I think  at least 3 of our 5 signings have been positive ones.

Also, to say he hasn't gotten more out of the Bale signings is a little odd considering the improved play of Chadli, a player who Sherwood had playing out of position most of last year. 

As well, the big thing that has changed is that our players seem happy, and there's a sense of comradery on this team that did not exist last year. Our defensive style aside, and our issues as a team aside, there's a sense of hope that did not exist last season. Sherwood's biggest issue was he did not know how to handle either the dressing room or the media, and those problems haven't seemed to exist in the same way this year.

wtf are you talking about perpetually offended? Did you even read anything I wrote or are you just munching on so much of murdoch's shit that all you read was ""PC BRIGRADE PC BRIGRADE PC BRIGRADE"".

As I said I think offense is sometimes healthy in developing understanding. The one thing I'm perpetually offended by is racism, because it's fucking disgraceful. 

Your suggestion of perpetual offense implies you think it is a choice, being offended IS NOT A CHOICE, it's an emotional reaction, how you react to offense is certainly a choice but the offense itself isn't. If your gonna take that view then you can just as easily argue depression is a life style choice.

&gt;DO something rather than bicker on the internet about what some caricature said for money if you are so invested.

Sorry do we know each other? HAve we met sometime at meetings  or activism I've been involved in? No I don't think we have have we, so take your piss poor assumptions and shove em up your arse.

Do I need to respond to anymore of your invaluable dribble? Seeing as it doesn't really contend anything I've written, just highlights your disagreement. 

&gt;your brand of lazy outrage is fucking tiresome

Your over dramatic statements are tiresome

&gt;and counter to the freedoms we all should aspire toward

Yea the freedom to offend, I'm sure history will remember that great civil struggle. 

&gt;I don't give a fuck if Clarkson is rich - his wealth is none of my fucking business.

Ok?

Trust me your not.

&gt;but I have no issue with tory voters

Kinda proves my last point

&gt;because it's a free fucking country

Indeed it is, at no point did I suggest tories should be imprisoned, your assumption kinda highlights your polarised, black n white view of the world.

&gt;something you've forgotten from up there on your soapbox.

No i havn't, and I won't disapprove of that soapbox perception but at least I'm not defending a fucking racist bigot.

&gt;Grow the fuck up and stop throwing your toys out of the pram

*sigh* Coming from the one who openly admits emotionally hurting people is acceptable collateral for a good laugh, a view taken by many a school bully.

&gt;because a dickhead personality made a dickhead statement which barely registers on the scale of actual offensive stuff that goes on in the world.

again this comes back to your black n white polarisation of issues.

I completely agree with you about Sherwood's man management abilities.  I in no way thought he was a sustainable option, however some of the things people are attributing to Poch (the success of our academy players, choosing youth over reputation) are things Sherwood actually pioneered.

I agree with you about Davies... I actually like him better in our current line up than Rose (even though Rose was really good in our last couple of games).  So yes, not a waste of money there... although I will say I'd probably prefer to have kept Siggy than gotten Davies and Vorm to be honest.

Fazio was an ok acquisition... again, there are things I like about him more than Dier, but it's a shame he's become more of a squad player now.

My point was perhaps overstated... ""waste of money"" is perhaps too harsh for Poch's signings, but it is fairly disappointing that only one of them has actually featured in our first choice XI.  He's improved our squad depth, but not our actual starting team.

Chadli is the one player who's looked better... but he has tailed off markedly in the second half of the season.

The European Union manages trade relations with countries outside the EU
through its trade policy.

&gt; **Trade policy is an exclusive power of the EU. This means that the EU, and not
individual member states, negotiates international trade agreements.** The
European Commission negotiates with the trading partner on behalf of the whole
EU but does so in close cooperation with the Council and European Parliament
who ultimately approve the overall agreement.

It is. And as someone who has multiple attempts on their own life in the past and actual y'know medically valid depression, fuck you for comparing choosing to be offended by some TV wank to an actual condition, way to disprove your point.

Pretty sure you're the one spilling histrionic offence over a fucking newspaper article here.

&gt;Yea the freedom to offend, I'm sure history will remember that great civil struggle.

I can assure you my voting pattern over the last 20 years reflects that truth, as does my campaigning and advocacy. But all me a right-winger if that's what your SRS mates reckon all the bad people are.
&gt;sigh Coming from the one who openly admits emotionally hurting people is acceptable collateral for a good laugh, a view taken by many a school bully.

Making a vague obviously jokey generalisation isn't emotionally hurting people. If you are hurt by jocular stereotypes then you need genuine help, not appeasement. FFS.

Poly's were different from Unis, and the Engineering courses they offered were generally different to University courses.  Poly courses were much more practically based, whilst University courses focused more on theory and design.  The entry requirements were quite different, and A-level in CDT would often count for Poly placement, but not for a Uni.  Most Uni's would require a high A-Level maths grade, whereas Poly's had a much lower requirement.  Poly's had lower entry requirements all round than Unis and had there own clearing system back in the day.  A poly degree was also viewed as less than a Uni degree both by students and employers.

Graduates from Poly's would often end up with Engineering jobs on the shop floor - production and manufacturing engineers.  University students would be more likely to go into design or R&amp;D.

I'm not saying they are. But I'm saying ridiculing people has consequences which are not always desirable. So we may choose not to ridicule some people.

&gt;Do you think the flat earth society or young earth creationists should be free from ridicule too?

I have already had this exact discussion further up the thread with another poster. Tl;dr If your goal is to stop someone being a flat-earther, ridicule is not a good way to go about it. It is also well established that ridicule pushes people towards extremism.

&gt; It is a powerful tool in exposing flawed opinions and propagating change.

I have also already answered this point further up the thread.

&gt; Look at how Arab satirists ridiculed their dictators in the run up to the Arab spring.

Right, and that led to the destruction of the dictators and their regimes and those involved in them. It did not lead to the dictators being more reasonable.

Our goal here (well, my goal) is not to destroy Islam and cast out those who held it by generating hatred against it (something mockery does very well).

&gt;Please explain to me how exactly it is mocking a religion to draw a historical figure

This is being willfully naive and does not warrant a reply in an intelligent discussion. (It has also already been addressed--it's a shame you didn't read the thread through.)

&gt; I hope you give such thought and care in every aspect of your life in case god forbid you offend someone.

Offense is part of life. But that doesn't mean we should go around willfully offending people to whom we want to show respect.

No it's not, do I need to do a google search for you on that word too?

&gt;And as someone who has multiple attempts on their own life in the past and actual y'know medically valid depression

Way to disprove your point by not acknowledging the definition of the word offensiveness

&gt;Pretty sure you're the one spilling histrionic offence over a fucking newspaper article here.

No I was initially making brief observations, your the one accusing me of undermining freedom of speech and being a bit too liberal with the caps lock.

&gt;YES IT FUCKING WILL YOU IMBECILE

Case in point

&gt; do you not understand that you are perpetuating a fucking totalitarian lockstep ideology that is ABHORRENT to any true leftist or true liberal of any political stripe.

No I think you're talking about libertarianism, very much different, I invite you to find me any liberal commentator that talks of the ""right to offend"" as a great civil struggle of this century, or any for that matter. (Please don't embarass yourself and cite that neo liberal sucker Christopher Hitchens)

&gt;I can assure you my voting pattern over the last 20 years reflects that truth, as does my campaigning and advocacy. 

*sigh* The fuck does this prove? A firm stance? YEa sure, certainly not that you are as ""anti-tory as they come"". I'm sure not everyone who voted for the BNP is a Nazi, again this feels like another example of your naieve black n white view of the world.

&gt;Making a vague obviously jokey generalisation

One correction, he makes specific jokey generalisations, and by the way, the idea of ""generalising"" is one of the key aspects of stereotyping, seriously mate do I have to provide these fucking definitions for you?

&gt;If you are hurt by jocular stereotypes then you need genuine help, not appeasement. FFS

Sorry but didn't you just explode before at my mere mention of depression? DO I also need to provide the definition of hypocrite to you, or perhaps you could follow you own values and **choose** not be offended by it.

&gt;I'm not the one who lacks nuance between a cheeky fucking joke and RACISM. outrage culture is fucking ridiculous.

It's not my fault if you struggle to see through the disingenuous statement, ""it's just a joke"". Neither is it my fault that you consistently polarise issues. I certainly don't do that.

&gt;You've clearly never watched Top Gear or read any of his (shit) writing.

Your ability to deduct reason is clearly unfounded.

In the end my Gran spent 10 years in a home, and spent all her savings on her care.  She was the only person in the home who had to pay for her own care, everybody else in the home got it paid by the state.  Man was she bitter.  She saw the fruits of her saving trickle out whilst living with people who'd spent all they'd ever earned.  They were better travelled than my Gran ever was, but got exactly the same care.

Despite it being almost entirely staffed by reds, I highly recommend the Aachen hotel. It's a very short walk from the train station and bus station to get to Goodison. I didn't know the staff were reds before hand, but they were nothing but nice and joked around with me as I wore nothing but Everton clothes the whole time I was there. It's in a convenient location and they serve a good breakfast. In terms of getting to the park, the bus service is pretty good (leaps and bounds over what I have near my house) and the locals were happy to help when my family and I had any questions. Regardless of club loyalty they were happy to help, again despite me wearing Everton jerseys the whole time I was there. Some locals told us the area around Goodison was a little shady when we wet to buy tickets the day before and were walking around, however on matchday its packed and frankly awesome. The players come in to the parking lot right next to the fans, and a lot of them were signing autographs, although granted all of this was before a friendly and I can't speak for league games. Seamus Coleman was signing autographs for a few minutes and I got one which led to me almost having a heart attack from just being so happy. The ground itself is beautiful and from where I was in the Park End it was amazing to hear Z-cars and Grand Old Team as I saw the players in person instead of on a screen. I'm sorry for this long winded reply, which I meant to be a simple hotel recommendation, but turned into me reminiscing about what has been the best day of my life so far. I hope you enjoy the game and the toffees win.

Morning sickness is considered a pregnancy-related illness.

In short, from the moment you are pregnant until the end of your maternity leave, if you are treated unfavourably due to any of the following, then it will be considered discrimination:

 * any absence due to pregnancy-related illness
 * a woman’s inability to attend a disciplinary hearing due to pregnancy sickness or other pregnancy-related conditions; or
 * **performance issues due to pregnancy sickness or other pregnancy-related conditions**

You can bring a claim against your employer for compensation at a tribunal if this occurs.

Do you have an HR department you can talk to about this? The law is IMO quite clearly on your side, and it is your manager's responsibility to be aware of the law and the company's obligations and responibilities. It sounds like he isn't currently.

If you believe that immigrants are to blame for all the ills that beset the UK then it is your job to provide evidence for this.

If people wish to make ""cultural"" arguments rather than economic ones, which is the main line of attack from UKIP and its supporters given the evidence above, then we are really going in to the realms of nebulous terms like ""British values"" which is at best quantifiable and at worst down right racist.

Whether you like it or not, the default is that we have immigration.  We have freedom of movement from within the EU and we have some movement outside it.  This is what we have and if you want it to change then it is YOU who supplies the evidence.  If evidence is no less subjective than the above statement then you have no right to complain about it.

You bring up Coutinho doing something wouldn't be brushed under the rug? You realise he does that consistently, right? Assaidi could do exactly that too, but people aren't interested in brief glimpses, it isn't enough to make them out to be good enough for a start. Coutinho getting praised for being a great player in general is completely different to some of the people who have literally made highlight videos of him pressing players. His performances weren't mindblowing, and definitely not enough to say we should start him over Sturridge who is realistically the only person we would take out without compromising our formation. The fact people can only claim a tap in versus spurs, a penalty and a free kick straight at the keeper as reasons to start him should highlight how little he actually has done. 

What media fuss???? HAHAHA. Every other fucking day there's another news story about Balotelli. He attracts stupid amounts of attention despite not doing anything, it's redundant and ridiculously annoying.

People act like we're holding back some kind of world beater. He didn't make it at City, he was turfed out by an AC Milan that is a shadow of their former self, and can't start for Liverpool. He hasn't really improved since he was a teenager, and is at best a *good* player. He's way too inconsistent to be deemed a star. He doesn't even make it up to his international team at the moment.

In my opinion he should be an option off the bench as he isn't good enough to start over any of the players he's competing with.

I highly recommend driving across country. We did it when moving from Minnesota to California 8 years ago and absolutely loved it. 

My tips for traveling these days - tour agencies are sort of a dying breed, and don't afrord the sort of adventure that would make the trip memorable. Car rentals are pretty expensive too. 

So my recommendation is to safe up some cash, and when you get here, to buy a cheap but reliable used car. 

Have a broad idea of the spots you're wanting to visit. 

Prior to driving to those spots, research sites like Living Social, Groupon and Gilt city for low cost activities and restaurants to visit in those areas. 


Use Airbnb.com to find affordable places to stay along the way.


Another option is to use Amtrak, which if you've got the time and inclinations is a stunning way to travel the country. If you're willing to be flewxible, here's a Midwest to Yellowstone itinerary through Amtrak. http://www.amtrakvacations.com/rail_vacations/rail-journeys/Midwest-to-the-Pacific/

You have to earn the right to be heard. If you want people to think you’re a party for people like them you have to respect people like them. And show that respect too. It’s not enough to claim it or boast about your bona fides, you need to earn them.

Swansea obviously setup to counter us, and Rodgers did the right thing at halftime in switching us up tactically, and it paid off. We were fortunate in the manner in which we scored and the fact we didn't concede in the first half, but it's a good sign we can win a game that looked like we were going to lose. 

I thought Can was caught out a lot defensively, and he still needs to learn his role as a CB with defensive duties a bit more. 

Our midfield had a quiet game, but for the entire first half of the game they were marked out of it by Swansea players, but when we changed it up, Hendo and Allen both did well.

Sturridge was poor overall. I see flashes of his old self, but I think hes too eager to force something to happen. It feels to me like he's trying to hard to get back in the swing of things, and it's causing some bad habits eg. being a bit selfish. I still think he's quality, and his tactical awareness and movement is amazing, he just needs a good run of form to get his confidence back.

Lallana's been going through a poor run of form. Saying that he still presses like a warrior and even in his poor games is capable of a moment of magic. 

Migs and Sterling were the best players for me. Sterling won us a lot of ground in their half, and was constantly taking on people successfully and generally being a pest. Migs quite frankly kept us in the game with his first half saves and continues his really impressive form.

Coutinho was very average by his standards, even in the second half, his passes were often loose and his touch was poor. 

Skrtel was again a rock at the back. I'm tempted to actually say he was as important as Migs thinking about it. He saved us quite a few times with some great defense.

Higher level maths papers are *significantly* more difficult than foundation level maths ones. If you look at the example papers on Bitesize, the first question of the higher GCSE non-calculator paper is

&gt;Give prime factorisations of 432 and 522.

Whilst the first question of the foundation GCSE non-calculator paper is:

&gt;Work out 1,436 + 217

This goes on all the way through, for example 10a on the higher paper asks:

&gt;Solve the inequality 5x+3≤3x-6

Whilst the foundation paper's 10a is:

&gt;A ten-sided die with sides numbered 1-10 is thrown.
&gt;
What is the probability of throwing a 1? 

I could probably get a perfect score on a foundation paper, but I'd need to sit down and seriously revise to get the same performance on the higher, as I suspect would most adults who don't use maths regularly.

He's going to be linked with big jobs as long as he has success with us - and of course he's going to want to go to Barca or Man City rather than staying here when the chance comes. But I like that he's also clear - he will see out his contract with us before looking elsewhere - so I don't see this as a bad thing.

No, it isn't. We didn't have free movement within the EU until very recently and mass immigration from outside it is also quite recent. This country was almost entirely homogenous and had been for millennia, until a few decades ago.

&gt;If people wish to make ""cultural"" arguments rather than economic ones, which is the main line of attack from UKIP and its supporters given the evidence above, then we are really going in to the realms of nebulous terms like ""British values"" which is at best quantifiable and at worst down right racist.

Believing that this country has its own values = racist. British people who want to be surrounded by their own culture in their own country = racist. Never mind that values are an entirely different and unrelated thing to race.
