Not always true, a lot of them do nod in my experience (and I'm only on L plates!) even when I'm not with my Harley-riding SO. Some don't, but neither do some other bikers, it's just the way things go - don't get bent out of shape over it. 

&gt; Buy tires with the weather in mind, so always go for one that is good in the wet

If you can get a good pair of [Heidenau](http://en.reifenwerk-heidenau.com/modules/reifenliste/view.php?point=2&amp;rtyp=9) tyres to fit your bike, do it. They are amazingly grippy, and fantastic in the wet. Never had a problem yet. Would definitely recommend these.

&gt; Get a helmet with a pinlock insert

Just to clarify, as I have one myself, these do still fog slightly in the wet if you breathe hard on them, but honest to god they are fantastic if you're not genuinely trying to mist them up. Makes wet weather driving so much easier! 

Edit: Also, hey OP - I'm a fellow lady biker, but I'm located further south (think Lincolnshire and Lancashire) and sometimes in North Wales.

null,false,sneakyi,lfcflame,,null,"I think BR deserves to have a squad next season to compete with. FSG have expected him to work under crazy constraints considering the expectations of where they want the club to be. This is how I see it and I have read many arguments saying it is all down to Rodgers. I just don't see it that way. The way the club is set up, we are looking for our manager to overperform every season and that is just not realistic given us losing our best player.

 I think there are deeper issues at the club that any new manager would also struggle with. Rodgers has made some head scratching decisions and we are definitely not a team that can grind out 1-0's under him. That said, I believe that last season showed what he could do with a competitive squad and if he was given one again, here or elsewhere, he would have them playing attractive winning football.

If Rodgers can't do the business next season I feel it would be the end of the cycle and we would be better giving someone else a try. 

I wouldn't be overly optimistic of them doing much better unless we set ourselves up as a defensive team, that learns to grind out results and give up on playing attractive football. Maybe we just don't have the required standard of player to play attractive football and win.

I see our position more of a result of FSG not investing much more into the club before FFP came into play and made it almost impossible to break into the top tier of clubs. People will give many reasons for this but the harsh reality is that was the only way to do it. 

Now we must hope for the best over the next 5-10 years with the stadium expansion and trying to increase revenues, a big gamble, though we are locked into it now.

New managers will come and go but they will have a tough time sustaining a top four position when we are not competitive in the transfer market. An odd season of relative success is probably the best we will get.

Bashing managers for this situation is just misplaced ire. Give Rodgers another year, then change if we don't progress as a team. Just don't expect us to find a miracle worker.

Wales would go the route of Kosovo and become a failed state if it became independent. Tax revenues in Wales are around 30% lower than government spending in Wales. There simply isn't any way to fund that gap for a new country without access to cheap credit.

Wales also has a lot more public sector workers as a % of workforce than England does. As most of those public sector jobs are from UK central government agencies, those jobs would be lost once independence is granted. Wales would certainly not have the funds to employ 27% of its workforce in the public sector if it became independent. 

The SNP also has no plans to try to gain independence during the 2015-2020 parliament.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Harry_Stanley

2 years later I was walking into a London housing estate. Someone had held up the bank 300 yards away and very loosely matched my ID. I was wearing headphones, there is a post office at the front of the estate ( cctv outside ). They pulled up and bounded out the car towards me. Pretty sure they never pulled their guns ( I was very hungover).

Held me closely by the arms and informed me they were going to search me for matching the perps description. While asking my details. Never gave them, PACE at the time never required it. Said to all 4 of them very civilly that they can search me but not in the St, get a van or take me in. They got narked put me in cuffs and searched me in public, bank card in pocket they CRO'd me and then asked me why I was being awkward. Simply replied that I was adhering to their guide lines. Accused me of being hostile and aggressive. I reminded him that we were in front of two camera's, 1 with audio. Told him I would make a official complaint. He got a little red faced and sheepish before the  4 of them jumped into 2 cars and leaving.

Found out later the perp had on a brown jacket ( mine was grey), he was 4 inches taller, he also red hair. Never made a complaint, it was a high stress situation for them, they were very hostile but not offensive or violent. I remeber thinking at the time though glad I wasn't carrying a table leg or something that could be mistaken for a weapon.

I've never been a massive fan of Miliband as Labour leader, but he went up massively in my estimation when he said that as I honestly believe that having a party in control of Westminster who will be actively working against the interests of England &amp; Wales will be extremely damaging to our country as a whole (although I'm sure the Scots will disagree with me on that point).

If the first thing he does after the polls close is 100% go back on his word in order to get into power at any cost I don't think it'd be the best way to kick off his term in charge. I'm certain it'd do nothing but further damage the Labour party in the long-run.

null,false,Loudshell,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"Do remember, that in truth, the Greens, UKIP and Liberal Democrats are incredibly unlikely to gain any form of majority and in the upcoming election, a coalition is much more likely between the parties:

Likely outcomes are as follows:
[Labour &amp; Green &amp; Lib Dem Coalition] *(MINORITY?)*
[Labour Government] *(MINORITY?)*
[Conservative &amp; Lib Dem Coalition] *(MINORITY?)*
[Conservative &amp; UKIP Coalition] *(MINORITY?)*

However, in the hypothetical scenario in which any party holds majority, these would be their first session legislative acts: 


Conservatives: 

* Extend Right to Buy to housing association tenants in England

* Eliminate the deficit and be running a surplus by the end of the Parliament

* Extra £8bn above inflation for the NHS by 2020

* 30 hours of free childcare per week for working parents of 3&amp;4-year-olds

* Legislate to keep people working 30 hours on minimum wage out of tax

* Referendum on Britain’s EU membership


Labour: 

* Responsibility ""triple lock"": fully funded manifesto, cut the deficit every year, balance the books as soon as possible in next Parliament

* Extra £2.5bn for NHS, largely paid for by a mansion tax on properties valued at over £2m

* Raise minimum wage to more than £8ph by 2019

* Freeze energy bills until 2017 and give energy regulator new powers to cut bills this winter

* No rise in VAT, NI or basic and higher rates of income tax

* Access to childcare from 8am-6pm for parents of primary school children



Liberal Democrats: 

* Balance the budget fairly through a mixture of cuts and taxes on higher earners

* Invest £8bn in the NHS. Equal care for mental &amp; physical health

* Five new laws to protect nature and fight climate change

* Increase tax-free allowance to £12,500

* Guarantee education funding from nursery to 19 with an extra £2.5bn and qualified teachers in every class



UKIP:

* Rapid referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union

* Control immigration with points system, limit of 50,000 skilled workers a year and a five-year ban on unskilled immigration

* Extra £3bn a year for the NHS in England

* No tax on the minimum wage

* Meet Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, and look to increase it “substantially”


Green:

* End austerity and restore the public sector, creating jobs that pay at least a living wage

* End privatisation of the National Health Service

* Work with other countries to ensure global temperatures do not rise by more than 2C

* £85bn programme of home insulation, renewable electricity generation &amp; flood defences

* Provide 500,000 social homes for rent by 2020 and control rent levels

* Return the railways to public hands

The initial coroner with a shady record (like PC Hardwood) was replaced due to incompetence and stating it was heart disease. Later coronary investigations stated it was blunt force trauma.  
PC Simon Hardwood was not found guilty of manslaughter in 2012.  
I think the police initially said, it was a member of the public who killed him by throwing things, that a protester dressed up as a police man killed him, that medics doing CPR were stoned and bottled. All wrong of course.

With the formula above though, minority groups clearly have a greater interest in the existence of minority-oriented services, and therefore a greater say.

&gt;A member of staff has complained that their managers have instructed all staff to wear hi-vis jackets, no matter what work activity they are doing.

*Panel decision*

&gt;There are no legal reasons for 'hi-vis' jackets to be worn at all times by all staff unless the risks in the workplace justify this. Implementing a blanket approach requiring staff to wear 'hi-vis' jackets at all times, in a predominantly low risk environment, does not seem a proportionate way to manage the risks. The employer should explain to their staff the real reasons why they are taking the approach of requiring blanket wearing of 'hi-vis' jackets.

To overly simplify, when you have a surplus you could pay an extra £5bn/yr off your debt or you could invest that extra money in schemes that could potentially result in additional growth, growth that even if small, would easily eclipse the amount of extra debt you're carrying. This is at the heart of the argument as to whether you can ""grow your way out"" of a recession and the general consensus amongst economists is that you not only can, but you should. Being in surplus is a poor use of your resources and is like leaving a large amount of money in a low interest savings account, it might make you feel good having it there but financially it doesn't make much sense.

Back to the original article, just because Labour spent *a lot* doesn't mean they spent *too much*. Spending that money in the way they spent it might have been the optimal strategy at the time. Similarly, the coalition's approach of cutting investment to pay down some of the debt might have been optimal (although as I mentioned the vast majority of economists believe this is not the case and the UK's recession was longer and deeper than it needed to be because of this approach).

This is the beauty of macro economics, it's not intuitive. The weight of opinion amongst economists was that the coalition should have borrowed more and invested more during the recession, but the evidence presented to the government was ignore for ideological reasons and continues to be.

A bit of context on the abuse of Craig Braham-Barrett. Last season some of you might remember a story where two Cheltenham players admitted to Mark Yates that they were not putting the effort in on the training ground. One of them was Jermaine McGlashan, who left for Gillingham, and the other was Craig Braham-Barrett. CBB's reputation among the fans never recovered really (especially because he was always generally seen as the weak link of the squad) and that results in the abuse from the stands and outside seen today and in previous weeks.

Having said that, I know someone studying Engineering at UCL and they love it there. All of the universities you've applied to are great places though, UCL is probably just the most famous.

How those universities rank for the individual subjects will depend on what kind of Engineering you're studying. For Mechanical Engineering for instance, Bristol and Southampton are both in the top 5 domestically whereas only Edinburgh is in the top 5 for Chemical. I've heard that Southampton is particularly good for Electronic Engineering, I'm not sure how true that is though.

All of the places you've applied to are in cities but there is still a difference between them. London is obviously absolutely massive, Manchester's very big too whereas Southampton and Bristol are a bit smaller (Bristol is very green!). So that should factor into it. London is definitely the most expensive out of those places by a long shot, my guess is that Edinburgh would be cheaper but I'm not sure.

Another thing I've heard is that the prestige of the institution you studied at is less important if you're going into Engineering, so I personally would emphasise which place you'd rather live in rather than which is the highest in the league tables. Are you sure you've done enough research? Take a look at the course specification for each course and look which ones look particularly interesting. Course structures vary significantly between universities.

Also, I'm not sure why people are telling OP to apply to Heriott-Watt...

It's an unpopular viewpoint in America right now, but I'm standing behind it. They were literally throwing bricks at police officers.

I just keep thinking of these police officers wives/families/children/whomever at home worried about if their loved one is ok while these riots are happening. That's not okay. That's not acceptable. If we said that hurting others was ok after a certain amount of abuse, imagine the awful world we would live in. It's just not something I believe in. I don't care what happened, you don't get to hurt random other people.

I also believe this goes far deeper than race. Places like Baltimore have a lot of drug issues, gangs, and violence. The people living in this area have no way out. Check out The Wire or the book The Corner. Very realistic and very depressing. These people struggle. There are issues of poverty, lack of education funding, and a lack of programs to keep these children and teenagers off the streets. We need to talk about these issues. Cops get frustrated in these areas. People get treated badly. No one is winning. I don't believe that more violence is the answer. I don't believe that destroying the city you live in, making any progress completely regress, and making middle class people afraid to move businesses there will help anything.

I think a better analogy is one were lives are at stake rather than broken noses. Say said muscle is walking along and someone full on attacks him, i.e. there's no doubt that's they're trying to kill him and have a very real possibility of doing so (they look big too, they have a knife, etc). Is he going to defend himself or not? Is anattacker more or less likely to attack someone built like the proverbial brick crap house?

Consider another scenario. It's 2040 and China is throwing it's weight around in world affairs, the US is weak due to a massive  economic heart attack and we've fallen out with them anyway because they keep trying to extend their laws into the wider world. Brazil is becoming a super-power and asks to join Europe and the UK in a sort of NATO style organisation to counter China's growing power - Brazil has the economic clout and a growing army, the EU has a nuclear capacity and lots of military tech.

So if you posted a tweet, just for a laugh and it went viral, and the media turn up on your doorstep and the doorstep of your relatives, you'd be totally happy with that.

The fact that they have purposefully gone out of their way to find your personal details without first contacting you to see if it was okay to come round for a chat. Oh yeah, and you're a young girl into the bargain.

You think there's nothing problematic about that?

Our high street options in the UK are crap for hypersensitive skin (I have rosacea) and even fewer for those of us who sweat too much (I have been investigated for hyperhidrosis but no decision made).

Have you seen our mega review linked to in the sidebar? A few of us here like Simple Kind to Skin+ Moisture Cream SPF 30 which is/ was £4 at Boots, but often on offer at various supermarkets, drugstores or Wilkinsons.

Final random thought is to attempt to support sunscreen use/ healthy skin from the inside and outside simultaneously. CE ferulic serums, various polyphenol and carotenoid antoixdants have photoprotective properties, and the antioxidants also do taken in the diet. Whether that would hep PLE as well as regular damage/ inflammation to sunlight I can't say but the worst case scenario is you get healthier.

Foods rich in these types of antioxidants include bright and dark fruit and veggies in the full rainbow of colours (many countries advocate seven to nine servings), cocoa, green tea, freshly ground coffee, certain seeds, walnuts etc.

You could also try a few drops of the Actives Formulas Antioxidant Booster added to your bottle of sunscreen.

How is someone supposed to say how something *isn't* a problem? To show something is a problem, you point out something problematic about it.

&gt;So if you posted a tweet, just for a laugh and it went viral, and the media turn up on your doorstep and the doorstep of your relatives, you'd be totally happy with that.

Wouldn't be happy but I wouldn't be disgusted or appalled by their actions like so many in this thread apparently are.

&gt;The fact that they have purposefully gone out of their way to find your personal details without first contacting you to see if it was okay to come round for a chat. 

Is knocking on the door not contacting you? 

&gt;Oh yeah, and you're a young girl into the bargain.


Irrelevant, because they've not done anything that's worse to do to a young girl than a grown adult. Because they've not done anything wrong to begin with.

&gt;Again, I'm not sure why you've written that sentence as it's clear what they want to do (but being the Sun, I'm sure they'll drag up some dirt about her or her grandmother or her step brother or a long dead relative)

I'm being extra clear for you because proving why something isn't problematic means you have to cover all the bases where you think someone might have a problem. Whether it was the sun or the guardian or the angel gabriel doesn't really change the nature of harassment. 

&gt; but you don't see anything wrong with the media just doorstepping without first making an appointment.

No I don't. Do you think someone knocking on your door is an invasion of your privacy/being?

&gt;I must be weird as I see all sorts of wrong in this situation. I don't want to live in your world.

&gt;The NLR family protein NLRP3 is an intracellular signaling molecule that senses many pathogen-derived, environmental and host-derived factors. Upon activation, NLRP3 binds to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). ASC in turn interacts with the cysteine protease caspase-1 to form a complex termed the inflammasome. This results in the activation of caspase-1, which cleaves the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 to their active forms and mediates a type of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis3. Other intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are also capable of forming inflammasomes. These include other NLR family members such as NLRP1 and NLRC4, as well as non-NLR PRRs such as the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensors absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and interferon, gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16)4. NLRP3-dependent IL-1β processing can also be activated by an indirect, non canonical pathway downstream of caspase-115.

acces either from crawfordsburn village, theres a path way at the left of teh old in as you look towards it, otherwise drive ito teh country park, towards the exit and youll go up a steep hill with a 20% sign, take a right into the first carpark up that hill and at the far end is a pathway that will take you toward the bridge eventually. at the end of the pathway there is a fenced off area, if I remember right it has an electricity substation, and also provides awkward access to the bridge...  

you'll need to do everything at night, get a train timetable and bear in mind not every train on the line is on the timetable, some are service trains etc, it would take spending a night up there to work it all out, again if you got caught up there it wouldn't be a case of 'clear off'. im not sure the landing would be suitable but if your accurate you could probobly clear a space, there is a shallow river that runs under too so if you dont mind getting your feet wet and want the maximum drop go for that, might need to prune a few tree branches....

no real experiance of it just a bit of an interest and watched flight of the frenchies too many times! I work in search and rescue too hence warning you off the Foyle ;)

The other could quite easily be politely and non invasively be requested to do an interview, she's on social media.

Mason cost the goal. Tried to play Aguero offside, couldn't. Then, he didn't even follow the play, just drifted back.  So disappointing. That was a Championship level play. 

Lloris was a beast on their set-pieces, though could have done better on the Aguero goal. I forgive though, since it's fucking Aguero and he's a monster.

Petrol/gas costs loads over here as the govt tax it heavily, plus you'd have to pay tax on your car, get insurance, and then maybe pay the congestion charge (charge to travel in central London by car to reduce...congestion :p, something like £10 a day).  Also the traffic is rubbish, and for someone getting used to driving in a city/on the left hand side of the road, would be insane. Drivers in London can be a bit mad.  

So a VISA card will help you some of the way certainly, but I think it will be down to the landlord/estate agent if they accept your bank account.  Transfers internationally often cost money for one or other side so I would check this one.  VISA is used in nearly all shops to everyday stuff should be ok but you will probably be charged a fee for each transaction.  This happened to me all the time when I lived in Russia/Vienna/Germany.  Absolutely check with your bank and your college over here.

I thought you might want to see the UK!  Your Oyster will only be valid in London and the surrounding areas.

It might help a bit to know some of the big chains as we don't always have the same as the US.  I can't remember if it was this thread, but someone said the UK is more expensive than the US.  It is, goods will cost more.

Waterstones - major bookshop chain

WHSmiths - major book/stationery/magazines chain

Tesco, Asda (cheap), Sainsburys, Waitrose (expensive), Aldi (very cheap) Lidl (very cheap) - supermarket chains. Anything saying 'metro' or 'express' or anything that isn't just the chain name and is smaller than a supermarket, is local and convenient and may be slightly more expensive.

Homebase or B&amp;Q for hardware and DIY

JustEat for takeaway! (vital)

Primark - very cheap to the point of dodgy clothes

H&amp;M - cheap clothes

We don't have cable really in the same way as the US.  We have Freeview, which is free (with a TV licence which every household watching live tv has to have) which is a large number of channels, with additional stuff you can buy as a package like Virgin or Sky.  We don't really have local TV in the same way as the US either, local news comes on the BBC after the headlines for about half an hour, or in London there's London Live.  There is local radio, however.

Don't forget about our different plugs!

As this is a stereotype you probably know this but - queuing.  We are shit hot at queuing.  If you are in a shop and there is no queue, form one if you need to wait.  Join one if there is one.  The tube and trains are less formalised, but there can be queuing there too (see the Jubilee line at rush hour).

For example, the convention developed that the House of Lords wouldn't oppose anything in a government's manifesto on the basis it's been approved by the public. However, that didn't stop the house from opposing lots of Labour's draconian Orwellian stuff.

As for the question, legally the Queen could appoint whomever she wanted as PM. It wouldn't even have to be a member of either house of Parliament. However, in practice she's bound by convention to appoint the leader of the person who is most able to command a majority in the House of Commons.

As for your question, if the PM died, the Tories would elect a new leader and that person would become PM if the Tories had a majority government. See the Conservative Party leadership election, 1990, or the Labour leadership election, 2007  for more details of a change of PM when a party has a majority.

In a coalition, things would be more complicated. The Tories could elect a new leader, but the other party in the coalition might withdraw from the coalition if they thought the new leader was someone they couldn't work with.

This means that they have alienated 2/3 of their voters (or 12% of the electorate). In other words, they have lost more than half of their core vote, based in their previous low of 17%. They have also lost 35% of their party membership, which is also at an all time low.

As such if Miliband has the opportunity to form this unholy alliance ...yet refuses, I think Labour would stand a much better chance of getting the government they actually want in a second election.

Because the narrative that has been sold (and sadly, is accepted at face value) requires the ultra wealthy to appear oppressed, despite decades of tax advantages for the rich (and / or blatantly and illegally evading taxes abroad, as we've recently seen in more than a few bank data leaks) - to say nothing of the privatization of state / quasi-state industries to the ultra wealthy in very, very good deals - and the subsequent gouging.

In reality, everyone in society succeeds where there is a strong working class. But a strong working class has effectively disappeared along with manufacturing in the last several decades because the ultra wealthy finds more profit in shipping these jobs to sweatshops in 3rd world countries, hiring immigrant workers or outsourcing - all of which create pressure on wages at home. 

These promises of ""new high paying jobs"" will (of course) never materialize. We could simply look around the world to see what is happening in other first world countries, but apparently people in countries the world around believe that they are somehow different, which will result in different outcomes. However this is naivete and fantasy.

Eventually the ultra wealthy know this will crumble when the consumer base ceases to exist, but that will be fine because they will have the lion's share of resources. 

Combined with austerity measures - and police and state security services routinely targeting the press and union leadership, doing their best to undermine challenges to the status quo - it's profoundly clear that the future is bleak for most of us.

No, you're confusing rationalism with empiricism. 

It is a basic syllogism which uses classical deductive reasoning.

1) Nigel Farage thinks the BBC shouldn't be making entertainment.

2) Doctor Who is an entertainment show made by the BBC.

Therefore...

3) Nigel Farage thinks the BBC shouldn't be making Doctor Who.

Given the premises, the conclusion must be true.

If you don't understand this, then you don't understand what rational thought is.

Then you haven't been paying very close attention, I'm afraid. I don't say that to be rude. But the regularly regurgitated lie of ""the mess we inherited from the last government"" exactly conflates Labour government spending with the debt incurred bailing out the banks because of the financial crisis. And we all saw how effective that lie had been in the most recent leaders' debate, when members of the audience scoffed when told otherwise.

&gt;They blame Labour for creating a large national debt which exacerbated its effects in the UK, not somehow being the architects of the US mortgage industry's downfall.

This too is inaccurate. Our debt pre-crisis was in no way unusual. Borrowing was cheap and the level of our debt was lower than at times under Thatcher. It was business as usual. Sure, having debt didn't help. But we suffered most due to the UK being home to the City, due to our economic reliance on financial services.

I don't believe the Tories do distinguish between Labour spending pre-crisis and Labour being light on banking regulation. They can't because Osborne not only promised to match Labour spending at the time, but the Tories also supported Labour's regulation structure. In fact they thought it was too stringent. So all they can do is, in the vaguest terms, attack the previous government for being financially irresponsible. Which is wholly unfair.

&gt;Labour overspending did not **trigger financial crash**

Nowhere have the Tories ever argued that Labour spending **triggered** the financial crisis. That was widely accepted to be the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage in the US and subsequent failure of the Asset backed securities supported by those mortgages.

The Tories claim (and nowhere have I said if I agree or disagree with those claims) Labour's spending polices meant that the UK was **effected more severely** by the financial crisis than it would otherwise have been.

I don't know if that's true or not, I am not passing judgement on that.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"How much of the cost increase is due to privatisation and not due to other factors (investment, fuel/electricity costs, wages, taxes, compliance with new legislation, etc)? I think saying ""it is more expensive after privatisation"" oversimplifies and omits rather a lot. BR also had the benefit of vertical integration that wouldn't have been allowed to exist anyway (since the EU dictates that track and train operations are separate). You'd still have the overhead, it'd just be totally state owned

It's worth noting that East Coast, while it was in state ownership, had the same large fare increases and none of its fares were really industry-beating in terms of affordability. Going from London to York or Edinburgh was hardly cheap.

I believe it's also current government policy to allow large fares increases in an attempt to decrease taxpayer subsidy

&gt; This dearth of private investment is shown by the fact that the average age of trains is higher than it was in 1996 and the number of new carriages has only increased by 3%.

The government dictates who gets new trains, when, who will build them, how much they'll cost to build and be leased for, just about every aspect, really. Look at the IEP project - procured and controlled by government with its eventual users (East Coast and First Great Western) deciding very little. I guess they get to choose what colour they'll be in? 

The IEP is very late in part due to said government meddling. They have to get that North East rail assembly plant up and running to build the thing (a Labour wheeze), rather than using an existing UK or foreign supplier who can build using current facilities. There are also questions over costs. It's not nicknamed the ""Insanely Expensive Project"" for nothing

This is a government thing too, not necessarily or totally due to privatisation. If we had kept BR there's every chance that we'd be in the same position. Especially since East Coast was state owned for most of the IEP procurement process.

&gt;  the electrification of the West Coast Mainline is underwritten by the Government and Network Rail as private funding couldn't be secured.

The West Coast Mainline was electrified in like the 50s, wasn't it? Upgrades to the WCML happened during the disastrous Railtrack era, but I'm not hardly shocked if the goverment underwrites investment in government owned infrastructure post-Railtrack.

As for Arsenal, I see them doing their usual thing of buying some depth/fringe players they need then one worldie (like they did with Cazorla, Ozil and Sanchez). Chelsea honestly don't need much improving, and will probably go for another striker as you mentioned. I'm not sure who they would go for, maybe someone like Austin? 

United will spend well I think, and if the rumours of them being in for Bale are true I can see them being in the title race next season. Part of me wants them to go for Bale, so that it is more likely we will get Memphis, but at the same time Bale returning to the PL is very daunting. I think they'll also improve that weird/shaky as fuck defence, and might finally after years of rumours get Hummels.

Why do I  say this? Well, to get into the top 1% of earners you need £166k. There are ~30m earners in the UK so means there's 300k people earning £166k or over.

That sounds like a lot of money but in London... hmmm, not so much. with a 3.5x salary mortgage that would just about get you a 2 bed flat in somewhere not so flashy in Zone 2 these days. Yet there are hundreds of thousands of properties worth over £1m in London. Now, I know only a modest proportion of these will be mortgaged, and that property prices are crazy. But to me, this doesn't add up. It doesn't seem like there would be enough high earners to keep this market going (even at low volumes) and there simply aren't enough oligarchs and foreign investors to take up the slack. 
So what this says to me is that if you are PAYE you are a chump and there must be a helluva lot of people in London not appearing in these statistics. This might be a 'no shit' moment, but Im not talking about Phillip Greens here but well paid professionals that are managing to get out of full on PAYE exposure on a cash salary.

Sorry for the tone of this reply but I just get frustrated when people don't care. It's the easy way out of responsibility which, I think, has been lacking for the last 25 years.

EDIT: Just one example, Labour promise this:

""Guarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer apprenticeships.""

I'm not saying to specifically vote for anyone but the fact that they promise something like this is excellent for people your age. This better than any work experience offered to students at 16.

I used to work for Lakeland. Their returns policy is unbelievably generous, although not *quite* as ridiculous as it once was.

Take them back; if you have your reciept you will be entitled to either a full cash refund or an exchange. If you do not, you will get either a replacement if the product still exists under the same item code, or you will get the last listed price on the computer system. If the item was heavily discounted at the end, you can push them and they will likely give you a price from the time you claimed to have bought the item. Lakeland work unbelievably hard to maintain a seriously high customer satisfaction level and will bend over backwards to sort it out for you.

If you do not have the reciept you will no longer be able to get a cash refund (you could up until 2010, I believe), but if you push, the item will be referred to head office who will issue you a cheque.

Just for an example of the level the company went to; a lady brought in some placemats she had had for circa 11 years, which we were unable to find on the system, nor in old catalogs as it was quite that old. They were worn, and she claimed they were much more heavily worn than they should've been post 11 years of usage... which was debatable to say the least. However it was referred to head office who I believe issued her with a 25 quid cheque via the mail. 

They deserve the rep they have as a company and they were leagues ahead of any other retail work I did since; a perfect first job while I was in sixth form.

If you have any issues in store regarding a refund or exchange, call head office. They will be very interested to hear as they really pride themselves on the return policy. It really is lifetime.

If we play Can as a RB me thinks he will face the belgium naughty boy too many times on his own and will get fucked.

I don't think it's a good idea to use Lambert, he can be easily kept on track by Chelsea's defense and I see no other way we can defeat then unless we use speed and passing. So I would go with a similar team we played on the semi-final:

Migs
Can-Skrtel-Lovren
Marko-Lucas-Hendo-Moreno
Lallana-Sterling-Coutinho

However teams that press us on our field when we play 3-4-3 really fuck our passing up, Van Gaal exposed that really well and it's been a problem since. That is not something Chelsea uses to do, but Mourinho is really clever and certainly knows these obvious flaws by now.

If we do play with 4 on the back I just hope we use Johnson at RB, Can is getting too flustered lately and being dribbled too much.

To answer your question, from my observation EU immigrants are treated in almost the same manner as British people, so if you really need to, you can claim and will receive benefits if you're eligible. 

It's however worth noting that from what I read about this issue a while ago, it is overblown. EU immigrants and Eastern Europeans specifically contribute to UK economy in terms of providing both cost efficient and highly skilled work but also in financial, tax terms (this was definitely the case for me). 

For other groups of immigrants, I will not go into too much detail, but I did have access to education statistics for one of largest UK cities as I was involved in Building Schools for Future programme (scrapped a while ago).

They've been ahead of the curve here as far back as I can remember, before being progressive got any real support at all.  Now there's a whole section of parties in Stormont who've largely joined their position who want to set up an opposition (we don't even have one) to the cosy DUP/Sinn Fein marriage, who all tend to share the same opinion on the Big Two.  I saw the Greens and Alliance around christmas present a shared thing on the ""cost of division"", calling out DUP and Sinn Fein for happily throwing away billions in keeping society divided to maintain power.

The DUP and UUP have an ""electoral pact"" this time round, where they've each given up a couple of constituencies so the other can run as the main Unionist candidate (the ""split vote"" has been a Unionist issue for decades).  I am in one of those constituencies.  I hope enough UUP voters are sickened at the thought of voting DUP and - even just to spite the very idea of a pact, at least - vote Naomi Long.

Nothing about this chart shows the system becoming more progressive. Let me highlight you for you why. All this chart shows is the top income earners paying more taxes as a % of taxes taken in.

The government may end up writing off that debt as well who knows, it's within their power to do so. Depends whether we end up with inflationary problems further down the line I guess. Before 2012 the money was just sitting at a subsidiary of the BoE so it was making the deficit look larger than it actually was 2010-2012. 

In hindsight you could say Labour overspent, we would have been better able to deal with the crisis had they ran a surplus. But this isn't a party issue, they all wanted to overspend. This would have resulted in cuts to spending in the years that they had a deficit though. There was quite a sharp fall in revenue 2001-2003, from 38% to 35% of GDP.

Did you not pay attention to the part when I said the estimates of modern historians have brought Stalin's death toll down more or less to the level of Hitler. In that context saying ""few million"" when both are around 20 million is a bit more charged.

Now, was the USSR less murderous than the Nazi regime? The Hitler figures were over the course of eleven years, a fairly short span and most of it is concentrated within the last few years. The dates you've chosen in your USSR comparison span thirty six years and in that time period by modern estimates it's roughly just as bad as the shorter Nazi regime.

It's not a competition but the USSR never came close to the efficient industrialised slaughter of the Nazi regime. There is a damn good reason Hitler is seen as worse than Stalin.

&gt;Oh and looking through my profile to find ""dirt"" is quite honestly pathetic and frankly a waste of your time (if you have any to waste).

Once you've been here as long as I have, looking through someone's profile quickly doesn't take more than a few seconds. It's not so much a case of finding dirt as it is checking if you're one of those far-right nutter accounts. If someone says something idiotic like ""fuck the marxists who are ruining this country"" the chances that they are someone you want to RES tag for future reference becomes quite high.

If I understood the article correctly the main difference is that ""unregulated"" Buy to let mortgages are not regulated by FSA rules i.e. the lender is under no obligation to ensure you are fully aware of the financial commitment you are making by borrowing their money. The assumption  is that a buy to let mortgage is a commercial  loan and it is up to the loaner to make sure they are fully educated in the implications of the loan. A regulated buy to let mortgage can be agreed if you state that you may in the future choose to live in the property or let it out to an immediate  family member. 

Apparently regulated buy to lets are a bit harder to find because there's more bureaucracy involved so some lenders don't bother offering it. The article doesn't go into any details on a scenario where you use the property as your primary residence and then decide to let it out later. Perhaps you have to change  your mortgage.

That being said, this transfer window Rodgers needs to bring in at least two bigger names in my opinion.

**What is it?**

Quoting gov.uk:

&gt;""Non-domiciled"" residents are UK residents whose permanent home (domicile) outside the UK may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income

If you don't earn more than £2,000 overseas and don't transfer this to a UK account, then you don't have to pay a charge to obtain this privilege.

Those who either transfer foreign income to a UK account or earn more than £2,000 outside the UK may choose to pay tax or pay a charge of £30,000 to avoid the tax, but lose tax-free allowances on Income Tax and Capital Gains taxes. Note that to do this you have to be resident of the UK for 7 out of the previous 9 tax years, with the charge rising to £50,000 if you have been resident for 12 out of 14 previous tax years

In effect; those who normally live outside the UK don't pay tax on income earnt outside of the UK, provided they follow certain conditions.

****
**Will it increase/decrease revenue?**

This is quite debatable. At the moment, we currently receive the annual £30,000 and £50,000 charges from non-domiciles. The suggestion is that by abolishing non-domicile status, you potentially get more money through tax than you would through charges, as often those with non-domicile status are the ""super-rich""; Roman Abramovich is an example of a super-rich person having non-domicile status

The problem that's been suggested however is that we could potentially see these super-rich people leave the UK to go to other places as they don't want to pay more tax; the UK relative to other countries is often seen as a bit of a tax-haven because of non-domicile status, but that doesn't mean there aren't other places these people can go (Switzerland comes to mind). If the exodus was large enough, then it could potentially reduce revenues, although its impossible to predict exactly how many people will leave.

****
**Are there alternatives to abolishing it?**

Yes; it's been suggested that we increase the charges for non-domicile status in order to bring in more revenue whilst still allowing for people to not pay tax on foreign income.

There's also the issue of inheritance; non-domicile status can be passed onto children for example. It's therefore been suggested that this be abolished instead of a whole abolition.

****
**Are there any reasons to/to not abolish non-domicile status other than decreasing tax revenue?**

The main argument here to abolish is really down to ethics; those who support the abolition say that the super-rich get away with not paying tax, even though they may have been in this country for years at a time, whilst others still have to pay full tax. People dislike the idea that ""the super-rich stay rich whilst the rest have to stay poor"". This is probably why abolition is a Labour policy, considering that they are a ""people-centric"" party (that isn't to say they don't focus on the economy either.).

The argument to not abolish is a more economical one; if we scare off the super-rich, could they take their investments with them and pull out the UK? This is the big scare as it could potentially stifle the economic recovery by reducing how well supported businesses are. Note that these businesses, if they are making less money, also pay less tax, thus reducing revenues and creating a domino effect. This is probably why the Conservatives prefer this policy due to the fact that they're ""economy-centric"" (Again, this isn't to say that they don't care about the general public either).

The thing with the Tory deficit on the 1990s was that it was in response to a recession in 1990 and 1991, in the years before this the govt was actually running a small surplus, then the recession kicked in and spending increases, as you expect.

What the tories handed over in 1997 was a falling deficit coming out of a recession, what Labour did in the 2000s was run a significant deficit going into a recession, primarily because Gordon Brown thought he had eliminated the idea of 'boom and bust' and they were lavishing their huge tax takes from the city into huge new public services and welfare schemes. This made the situation much worse when recession hit again, and legitimised the tories austerity campaign.

If the professional historians who spend their lives studying these are mostly in agreement that it's around 20 million then why should anyone take seriously a person who just believes it to be higher? At any rate the ludicrous 60 million figure is cold war propaganda.  

&gt;Hitler is generally said to have caused around 11 million deaths during his time, about half that of Stalin.

The 11 million deaths is just the Holocaust. Including Soviet civilians killed through famine and disease caused by the Nazi invasion the toll climbs higher to about 20 million.

&gt;I'm not arguing that Hitler was 'good guy', I was just arguing that Stalin was probably just as evil and more dangerous.

Don't worry I don't think you see Hitler as a role model or anything but be aware that things like Holocaust denial are not outright denying it happened but include minimising the magnitude of it. This makes these genocide olympics debates a bit risky when you take the view that Stalin was worse. And it was in this sense that you were teetering dangerously on the edge of it.

I think though a person who writes about eliminating a group of people and considers them subhuman and acts upon this to systematically and efficiently kill millions of who he considers subhuman beings is a little more dangerous than a man who gets paranoid and uses his absolute power to kill any who might oppose him. Stalin was dangerous but Hitler was a special kind of crazy.

* **Lack of connection with the Players**: With so many forgien players coming in to teams, including  players from Englaind,Ireland etc. fans tend to feel a tad distanced from the players 

* **Lack of Development Players in First team**: Leading on from above, everytime a non home-grown player comes in to a team a young development player is pushed to the side and back playing development football. Nothing gets a fan more excited than a young player who has spent his entire life at the club getting regular game time and exceling. I must say Dundee United have been doing at group job at bleeding their youth and giving them regular first team football.

* **The Format of the League**: Playing the same team 4 times a year does nothing but scare away fans and dilute rivalries, the Chairman of the Premier league had a chance to fix this a few years ago but greed got the better of them and fucked over the fans once again.

* **No Summer Football**: Sitting in the freezing cold on a Rainy December morning isn't fun for the players or fans, we need summer football.

null,false,square13,null,null,null,"On the whole a good post, the author or the article is clearly not qualified to comment on this kind of stuff, but there are a few things you have written I take issue with. Mostly I don't think you should be comparing public sector debt between countries really, budget deficits are a much better indication of the state of public finances at a given point in time or over shorter periods of time. Total public sector debt has all kinds of historical things going back even hundreds of years contributing to it.

-""Did Labour spend too much? Well not if you compare a 2007 debt/gdp ratio of 43% in UK with 67% in Germany and 107% in Greece."" 

The amount of public sector debt isn't really a huge issue for our country, what effects investor confidence is the rate at which it is growing and whether or not they believe this is sustainable or will result in potentially higher taxes in the future.  If you look at a different graph on the website you posted, you will see that in 2010 our budget deficit as % of GDP was considerably larger than France and Germany both before and after the 2008 crisis, and if you put Greece on as well you will see that our deficit was only 0.9% less than theirs in 2010 when the coalition took over. Portugal, who had been bailed out, had a lower deficit than we did. So in 2010, I think it's fair to say that our deficit was out of control and there was a decent argument to be made about eliminating it, given the hardships other countries had found themselves in with similar deficits.

- ""13 years of spending eh? Well in 1996 the Tory govt was running a deficit of 4.3%, by 1998 the Labour govt had reduced that deficit to 0.1% and reached a surplus of 3.5% by 2000. So basically they spent their first three years in office wiping out a Tory deficit, hardly sounds reckless to me""

In 1997 the deficit that the tories had been running was in response to the recession of 1990-1991. In the years prior to this they had actually been running one of the first surpluses in years. The deficit had reached it peak and it was falling, so in 1997 the tories handed over an economy with a falling deficit coming out of a recession, also IIRC they handed over spending plans which Gordon Brown largely followed. The difference in 2010 was that the government under the Labour party had run a structural deficit going into a recession.

Also, I find it a bit hypocritical for you to call this a 'tory deficit' yet your whole post is about absolving the labour party of responsibility for the deficit/debt of 2008/2009?

-""Would things have been different under the Tories? Osborne pledged to match Labour spending http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6975536.stm and I'd bet everything I own that a Tory govt would also have bailed out the banks.""

This I see thrown around on this subreddit a lot, I'm not saying it's wrong or he didn't say it. But the same people who say 'Osborne would've matched Labour spending pound for pound' also claim that the tories and Osborne are heartless bastards who want to cut the state to victorian levels and take people's benefits off them. Both arguments seem to me to be completely opposite. So which one is it?

-""Well the explosion of the UK financial sector started in the 80s under Thatcher with the ""big bang"" and her own ministers warned her of the potential for ""boom and bust"" http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f3c0d500-8537-11e4-bb63-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Z6EUZVXJ""

Advice clearly not heeded by Gordon Brown either.

-""Considering that unlike Greece and every other Eurozone Country the UK still has a central bank that CAN LITERALLY PRINT MONEY, how exactly was the UK bankrupt or ever faced with the possibility that it could go bankrupt?"" 

Countries that print their own money certainly can go bankrupt, Argentina in 2002, Iceland came very very close in 2009. Whilst having our own central bank is definitely a plus, it isn't a get out of jail free card. Germany printed huge amounts of money to exchange for foreign currency to pay off the reparations after WW1, the result? Hyperinflation and paving the way for the nazis.

Printing money and doing QE can work to some extent but it can't continue indefinitely, the interest on the existing debt increases more money has to be printed to pay it off once the gilts are sold back on the market, and eventually you get inflation. As inflation rises the less likely you are to attract others than the central bank to invest in govt bonds and the more expensive it will be for the government to actually borrow money.",null,0,null,1430689071,null,0,1430697517,0,cqxamg1,null,t3_34qmeg,null,t1_cqxamg1,null,t3_34qmeg,null,null,null,1432752053,null,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35,null

It's laughable that you use this ratio as a defense, Northern Ireland was not neutral, there were no barriers to recruitment, a large proportion of it's population is frightfully proud of its loyalty to the union; Yet the South, which had an official Government policy of Neutrality and a lot more historical baggage regarding the British Military still had more recruits. It should also be borne in mind that quite a number of the 38,000 from NI were in fact northern nationalists.

We've spent a huge deal last summer but in terms of net spending, not extravagantly, but that is expected given the stadium needs. I think we have a good squad, but we've wasted money in the past on going for cheaper, low risk high reward buys (Aspas/Sturridge being the best examples). 

We wasted £20m on Alberto, Aspas and Ilori. Now we have the size and depth so as to focus on improving the first 11 and spend £20m+ on players. The three players you mentioned would cost £65m or so.

Deficit fell from 3.5% GDP in 2004-5 to 2.6% GDP in 2007-8 (according the OBR's Sept '14 figures) and then increased not because Labour policy changed but because there was a global crisis. Deficit increases under Labour were, even more than in the 90s, a response to a really bad recession. 

Also when the post says 'not like Greece' the point is not that the numbers aren't the same, more than they don't mean the same. Greece's debt is a problem because the European Central Bank was the only body that could print Euros and it was outside Greece's control, meaning that it was actually possible for them to default. Britain's situation is different, because we control the creation of sterling. We can't default on our loans, so borrowing isn't as risky because everyone knows they'll be paid back.

1) Look up what anecdotal evidence means

2) If you're now claiming that by 'people' you really meant 'three people' then I would question whether you were right that OP was missing a 'broader point' as you initially charged...  At best you could claim he was missing a much *much* narrower point!  Either way, it's the views of only a small minority of the public.

&gt;And I'd also suggest that much of the evidence gathered pre-election is outdated now we're in the election period.

3) I've already explained to you that if we were to assume that hypothesis, we would expect to see a clear rightward shift in the polls since January, which we clearly haven't.

4)   Also, given that the only evidence that you've provided is anecdotal evidence from you and at least two other people, are you claiming that you've changed your mind since the election?

5) Your original statement implied you were talking in reference to a reaction to Labour's spending while in power, whereas now you seem to think this is an opinion which has developed in just the last few weeks, 5 years after they left office!

This isn't how it works. Just because the SNP get 50 odd MPs, doesn't mean they are given automatic right into Government. When dealing with the government of the UK, it has to have in its interest all of the UK, not a party primarily concerned with only 4% of the population.

The SNP have also been caught in a trap which will be very hard to get out of. They have for ages been saying, that ""We want to get the Tories out"". That's all well and good. However, if Labour lead a minority Government, the SNP will have to vote with them on a lot of issues, because the opposition can mount a challenge and topple the Government, ushering in the Tories and screwing over the SNP.

This is how UK wide politics works. When you start playing the Game against the Tories and Labour, you better have a good game plan or you will get screwed over.

null,false,iRoygbiv,UnionFlag,Street Triple R,null,"I have a few bits of advice:

- Most people don't seem to realise but bolt cutters can slice right through almost any chain that's less about 16mm wide. Seriously. There are videos online and it takes a few seconds to get through most chains. Therefore I recommend getting an Almax chain and/or a fahgettaboudit U lock. Anything smaller isn't really worth it!

- I just got me some Revit tornado over trousers. They are expensive but absolutely *perfect*! I've owned 4 pairs of motorbike trousers over the past few years and these are light years ahead of anything else I've tried. They have an outer mesh section which means in summer they are perfectly cool, as if you aren't wearing them at all. They also have a thermal inner waterproof liner which keeps you toasty in winter. The liner is very quick and easy to take in and out unlike most trousers. They are also very adjustable and comfortable and finally they have full leg length side zippers which mean you can easily get them on and off over your shoes.

- I highly recommend the N44 Nolan helmet. It has the best field of view of any helmet I've ever seen, which makes driving and checking blind spots much much less stressful. 

- And finally... A contentious one. I strongly believe that ""loud pipes save lives"". Before I had a loud exhaust I constantly had people turning in front of me, pedestrians stepping into my path, cars acting like I'm invisible. Now it almost never happens. I can't believe how big the difference is. Also a nice bonus is that because British drivers are so nice and polite, if a car hears me it will very often move over to give me space to get through. Sometimes I feel like an ambulance because so many cars have moved over for me! (Though bare in mind I am in London so most of my driving is at fairly low speed, so the noise is more noticeable to the cars around me).

EDIT: By losing players such as Gerrard and Johnson the club needs to spend big money on key players who can contribute immediately. 

A top keeper such as Handanovic could plausibly be bought this Summer to provide a genuine fight for the #1 Jersey. Would have no problems buying a young, raw keeper with huge upside such as Karius or Ryan though. 

The right back position needs a player who can contribute and start now, I'm impressed by Janmaat and he'll only improve in a stronger defence with better coaching. Shouldn't be too expensive considering Newcastles current state of club. Darmian I believe we should try to sign but we will face competition from big clubs.

I don't trust Moreno with the starting LB position in a back 4 currently, hes far too big a liability defensively. Caner Erkin is a phenomenal player who will be cheap and can replace Gerrards set-piece taking duties. He can also player Left wing back and left midfield too if need be.

Lucas has been solid this season but the rumours persist of him seeking a transfer and his injury problems are not going away. Grezgorz Krychowiak would be a true Marquee signing and has the potential to be among the best in the world at his position.

James Milner on a free transfer would immediately improve the team. No brainer as he provides everything you want in a midfielder with versatility, hard work, set-piece ability and has key experience in big games and in winning trophies.

We need a big signing to improve the striker/centre forward postion and Firminho fits the bill. He could start anywhere among the front free and would give us a quality striking option when Sturridge is unfit.

Manchester United are going to spend upwards of 100 million this Summer and will improve, Arsenal will spend big, Man City will definitely go on a huge spending spree so Liverpool need to sign big, key signings this Summer or yet again fade into the Europa places.

Yes. I feel like our healthcare is very, very broken and needs to be addressed on multiple fronts. Obamacare is an excellent idea with the right start, at least conceptually, but there are loose ends that need to be addressed.

One example I can think of that effects the poor population mostly (...what doesn't...) is if you *don't* have health insurance you have to pay a fine. The fine is about the same as the cost of insurance in some cases. My argument is if you could afford to buy your own insurance, assuming your employer isn't providing it, then you would. Fining people doesn't make the money appear like magic. I know a few people impacted by this actually, so it makes me more than a tad upset.

There was also a big Supreme Court case (FYI our topmost level in the courts) last year with Hobby Lobby that came about directly as a result of Obamacare. Hobby Lobby had, ironically, been covering birth control as part of their employee health insurance plan prior to Obamacare. Of course Obamacare comes out, people sh\*t their pants, and Hobby Lobby decides to not cover some of the forms they had previously saying that they refused to cover ""abortifcants"" (the contraceptives in question weren't abortificants, to be clear) on religious grounds. They actually won the case, the ruling of which basically allows private corporations to have religious beliefs (""corporate personhood""). This is actually a case where Obamacare ""robbed Peter to pay Paul"" - on the one hand Obamacare requires companies to cover birth control as part of women's health, but the result is that now private companies are another step closer to being considered ""persons"" under our law. Mess. It's just all a mess.

&gt;Considering that unlike Greece and every other Eurozone Country the UK still has a central bank that CAN LITERALLY PRINT MONEY, how exactly was the UK bankrupt or ever faced with the possibility that it could go bankrupt?


Having the ability to print money is a great asset for a country as this means you can use monetary policy to counter certain economic shocks, such as the global financial crisis. 
But, it does not give a government the ability to run an unlimited deficit. 
Large money printing to fund unsustainable deficits lead to inflation and in the extreme you get hyperinflation (this is exactly what Zimbabwe did). 
The government might still technically be solvent, but the currency becomes worthless, cutting the government off from other sources of credit than the BoE and ruining everyone earning and holding GBP. 
Having your own currency does not give governments the ability to run unsustainable deficits and this puts a real limit on policymakers ability to spend ""beyond their means"".
The household reasoning is not perfect, but with some modifications it does hold.

Money supply can and should be used to counter economic shocks, by increasing the supply of money (printing) the BoE can lower the value of the GBP, increasing inflation and depreciating the Forex rates, to promote British exports in the short run. 
Real interest rates are also temporarily lowered through unexpected printing which spurs investments. 
It can not be used to hold government spending at unsustainable levels.
Economists use the Mundell Fleming model and its offshoots to study this, the wiki-article is worth a read.

On deficits then:
Governments can run deficits for ever, as long as the debt to GDP ratio stays at or below an equillibrium level.
This is obviously dependent on the growth rate: higher growth allows for a larger deficit.
Thats why we talk about sustainable deficits.
If you run over the equillibrium level you are in shit street (Greece). 
No one knows where that level is though, that's why the EMU can't decide whether to kick Greece out or not. The level is dependent on one key factor: creditors beliefs, i.e. your credit rating.
AFAIK british government bonds are AAA and stable so not beign able to pay is very far off.

Also, a side note:

&gt;Firstly, the spin here is laughable - the notion that all govt spending is just a bribe!


Well, there is some truth to that notion I'm afraid. A lot of government spending is just a bribe to gain wide support, thats why they all try helping the ""middle class"" as much as possible.

Honestly though, i understand. At the time it felt like a massive personal betrayal. But on reflection, i'm becoming more and more convinced that the Lib Dems really just made the best of a bad situation, that they have managed to make the impacts of a Conservative government at least a little less severe and saw through what it would cost their party in the short term in order to make themselves relevant again for the first time in a century.

What's to stop them from doing the same this time? With Labour and the Conservatives pretty much neck and neck on seats, and with the party sharing a lot more policies with Labour, there is considerable pressure within the party to try to work with Labour.

&gt; *[5] Brian Barton, Northern Ireland in the Second World War (Belfast, 1995)*, *p. 84 ; Keith Jeffery, 'The British Army and Ireland since 1922' in Thomas Bartlett and Keith Jeffery (eds), [A military history of Ireland](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MPZiWhhAmXAC&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;vq=%27streets%2C%20cinemas%20and%20cafes%20packed%20with%20%22loyal%20Ulstermen%22%2C%20loyally%20staying%20at&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (Cambridge, 1996), p. 438*.

You'll have to clarify the following because i have no idea what it's supposed to mean.

&gt; Whatabout the fact that if it wasn't for the existance of Northern Ireland those Irish people would have had an even 
harder time in fighting for the British.

.

&gt; It's hardly whataboutery - more people in Northern Ireland joined the UDA - get fucked that's yet more whataboutery.

Putting something in context isn't ""whataboutery""; I believe it is a perfectly reasonable comparison between the lacklustre recruitment in WW2; the next feasible comparison in terms of numbers and volunteering is the UDA which had 40,000 members in the 1970's.

The Free State was in its eighteenth year of existence; Ireland had lost many young men in WW1, in the War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War. It would have been absolute madness to have thrown all of its resources into the Second World War. With regards to the Cranborne Report it's clear that the Free States sympathies did not lie with Nazi Germany. However it's decision to remain neutral, i believe, was the correct decision at the time.

&gt; I was slabbering at the Irish government for being hypocritical pricks - not the Irish people who decided to take up arms.

There was no hypocrisy the Irish Government Drew up ""doomsday plans"" alongside the British Government, to be enacted if Britain was invaded.

&gt; In his book Wings over Ireland – History of the Irish Air Corps, Donal McCarron gives extensive details on the otherwise secret Rathduff aerodrome. He states that as early as the summer of 1940 both governments were worried about the ""Doomsday scenario"" of a successful invasion of Britain. The RAF would need at least one aerodrome to continue the fight in Ireland and both the Irish and British armies secretly scouted for a site in the south of Ireland. The other airfields of Rineanna near Limerick and Dublin airport and Baldonnel near Dublin would cover other parts of Ireland, so the RAF was keen on a site near the southeast coast.
&gt; 
&gt; The Irish Army disagreed, fearing a German invasion would overrun it quickly, so both finally agreed on a site in the south of County Tipperary, in the valley of the river Suir, east of the Galtee Mountains. This also suited the Irish army as they had built a secret command headquarters near a convent school seven miles away to be used in case of invasion. The name ""Rathduff"" was chosen as a cover because such a name is to be found all over Munster. Both sites were completely out of bounds for all normal military operations.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_neutrality_during_World_War_II#Ireland.2C_Britain.27s_last_Redoubt.3F)

One thing should be made very clear; because there seems to be some confusion. The people who were charged for desertion or absence without leave, left their posts within the Irish army; against orders to join another army. Other citizens who signed up to fight in the Second World War did not receive any penalties.

Not true, assuming the polling is correct and Lab+SNP &gt;=326 then the SNP only **have** to support Labour in confidence motions to keep them in government.  Of course they're likely to vote to support things that advance core SNP policies, but they don't have to vote for anything else (as Labour has been at pains to stress recently as part of their 'we'll propose and I dare you to vote it down' approach).  The outcome could be a rather lame duck government, but minority governments must build consensus or else achieve nothing.  Thus it will ultimately be a test of Ed's diplomacy.

It costs us I think £45 a month (base price for Home::1 service is £25, plus £10 for the fibre, plus another £10 to take us up to 200gb download quota) - we could get 80/20 for another £10 on top, but it's not necessary.

British politics has its problems, but they're completely separate from America. Lots of people feel disenfranchised from the political process and have for a long time. Our lobbies aren't as influential but that doesn't mean that they're not present. We're starting to see toxic US-style attack ads appearing here as well. 

Remember that an EU exit is still a distinctly tiny possibility at this point. The massive, massive incumbency effect would probably rule it out even if polls showed a majority in favour of leaving - which they don't.

It's nice that you're keeping up though! If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.

Yeah, so I have a few questions regarding the community around the facility, specifically:

Do you see much collaboration between the students within the different programs (outside of working on the literary magazine); if so, what are they? What about the students from the other universities, is there much or any interaction socially and creatively?

I’ve been told a few times by the school that there’s generally an event held at Reid Hall a few times a month, sometimes every week. What sort of events are these? Are they open to all students of the various universities? 

Since this is a program away from the main campus, how much of a hassle is it to deal with university needs, if they arise, while residing in Paris? Is there a representative from the school that’s around Reid Hall to speak with if something comes up?

While my language skills in french are pretty much standard greetings, the things I’m most concerned about is finding an apartment. I have a few friends that live out there, but I doubt they’ll have the time to help me with this. How did the school help you with finding a place to stay? How did you decided which area in Paris was best for you?

I’m interested in becoming a staff member on the literary magazine, and was wondering what that process is like. I’ve tried to get in contact with the school and the magazine but haven’t really heard back a response that answers this. Would you know?

I’m pretty excited to begin my studies! Thanks!",null,0,null,1430699792,null,0,false,0,cqxg79x,null,t3_335ob9,null,t1_cqxg79x,null,t1_cqvkdci,null,null,null,1432754752,null,1,false,canterbury,t5_2sbso,1,null

[This document](http://www.workingonwheels.org/images/stories/PDFs/Briefing_Papers/WOW_Briefing_Paper-Transport_Regulations_Check_List.pdf) lays out a fair bit of the regulations relating to play buses:

* They mainly are regulated under Regulation 3 of the [Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2864/pdfs/uksi_19992864_en.pdf), where they are defined as: ""a vehicle which has a maximum authorised mass exceeding
3.5 tonnes, is constructed or adapted to carry not more than eight persons in addition to
the driver and carries principally goods or burden consisting of—
(a) play or educational equipment and articles required in connection with the use of such
equipment, or
(b) articles required for the purposes of display or of an exhibition,
and the primary purpose of which is use as a recreational, educational or instructional
facility when stationary"". 

* However, the definition of a ""playbus"" in the Goods Vehicles Regulations is ""[a] motor [vehicle] that [was] originally constructed to carry more
than 12 passengers but which have been adapted primarily for the carriage of play
things for children"", as amended by the [Motor Vehicles (Tests) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 1982](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/1477/regulation/3/made), which also subjects them to a [Class V test yearly](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/1477/regulation/4/made). 

In conclusion: no, you couldn't, as the core definition of a play bus for MOT testing is a bus aimed at children, and MOT testing is required yearly. In any case, even the licensing description suggests that it must be an educational purpose to be defined as a play bus, and you wouldn't be able to get the DVLA to change the tax class to claim any potential exemption from MOT, which is ruled out by the amendment to the GVR anyway. You might be able to claim an exemption from MOT fees, but that doesn't mean that you don't have to take the roadworthiness tests, which cost [£80.65](https://www.gov.uk/getting-an-mot/mot-test-fees).

For example: playbuses don't appear on the [full exemption from MOT](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/333128/V112_150514.pdf) papers. It's just a weird loophole in the law that they are simultaneously exempted from MOT fees but have to pay MOT fees due to a compulsory testing requirement. Not that the bus you described would be able to be considered a playbus.",null,0,null,1430700133,null,0,1430701237,0,cqxgdr6,null,t3_34rq8u,null,t1_cqxgdr6,null,t3_34rq8u,null,null,null,1432754837,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I can see nothing that states [edit: actual statistical evidence not just reported speech of someone saying something is the case but just using the number of men sent and leaving it at that] because fewer Northern Irish men signed up that their contribution was found lacking. 

Also the source you provide mentions Northern Ireland's considerable use in the war. You can't be fighting on the front lines and building a ship for the Arctic convoys at the same time now can you? 

A churchill quote is great and all, love them, but the amount of ships built, other military materiel, the agriculture, the ability to be a staging platform, the ships using the Mournes for target practice, the fact the Royal Ulster Rifles were the only British troops to have both battalions involved in Normandy. Fuck - an Irish meteorogical station staged that landing. A neutral country giving over information to an allied power to help in the biggest amhibious invasion ever.

I don't think Ireland was neutral during the war and it may not have sympathized with the Nazis but it had planned on their winning the war too and what to do if that happened. 

It wasn't strategically, not morally or ethically, not economically, not when it was helping out the Northern Irish with Fire Engines during the Belfast blitz - because remember Northern Ireland played so small a role that the Germans decided to bomb the shit out of Belfast. There are just so many inconsistencies with the definition of ""neutral"". It's not just the domesday plan. It's the manipulation of citizens, the emergency control powers, the trade, the intelligence, the continual talks between British and Irish civil servants throughout the war. The arrest and detention of spys in NI, the ability to retrieve aircraft. The radar support. And quite a few other things. 

Yes - the horrid treatment was reserved to those who had been in the Army - one that ironically wouldn't take up arms - and had plans to be peaceful to whomever won the war. But no one in the government who had interacted with the British or helped in the war effort was ostracised. That was reserved for one type of person who did the right thing.

The fact that a potential companion killed the last Doctor is a nice twist on a character introduction and I like the idea of someone refusing the call every now and then so Grace saying no was actually a nice touch in my opinion.

I'm not arguing that the Conservatives haven't damaged our country, they have. But there was no real alternative.

Even if they had tried to form a government with Labour, it would have been with Brown. It would have been with ""New Labour"". Is that really what people wanted? Still probably better than the Conservatives, yes, but i think their time in opposition, their change in leaders and direction, has made the Labour party a better option now than it was then.

I'd also like to point out that if you don't like FPTP, the Lib Dems are the ones pushing for STV. They're the reason for the AV referendum. The Conservatives and Labour are the reason it didn't succeed.

The tuition fees issue was a big one for me at the time, because i'm one of the sods that has to endure it. And i say endure, but... I have more money to live on than my brother did under the old system. I have to be earning a lot more than my brother will before i'll have to start paying it back. The ""total amount"" may be higher but that's never really going to impact my life. If i'm ever earning so much that i even come close to paying it all back then i'll be comfortable enough that i won't care. It's easy to criticise them over this. Very easy, i protested against the increase, i involved students at my school and my teachers and my local councillors. I complained about it for years afterwards. But now? Living with the reality?

I highly recommend it for anyone even vaguely interested in how the railways work in this country, and especially for those who like the idea of renationalisation but don't really know what it would entail.

I don't think this documentary is perfect — I feel there are a few issues it just touches on that probably should have been elaborated on, a few notable omissions, and a few *very minor* errors. But, well, they only have an hour, and on the whole, it's quite probably the best thing I've seen or read about how the railways work in the mainstream (ie non-industry-orientated) media.

The whole thing. They had no experience of power, no experience of the repercussions it brings and that's why they made the pledge. They could have ignored it entirely but instead they made it one of their main focusses.

It was a mistake, but it was an honest one that they acknowledged and apologised for. Politicians make mistakes all the time. They break promises and they lie.

* Redditing (obviously)
* Shooting (game &amp; clays). I run a small hobby/syndicate pheasant shoot with a few mates, that takes up every other Saturday in the winter and maybe one Saturday a month during the summer.
* Rural pubs. You simply can't beat a summer's evening chilling in a country-pub beer garden.
* Cricket &amp; Croquet. I've only just got into croquet but there's an informal team meets every Thursday at my local cricket ground, it's a pretty good sport. I'd recommend getting into it if you can find somewhere local to play that isn't full of toffs.
* Movies. I have a half-decent home cinema.
* R/C cars. I have a couple of fairly beastly 1/5th scale models which run off 26cc 2-stroke petrol engines and could break your legs if one ran into you at full-chat. These will do until I can afford a proper track-day car.
* F1. I normally try to make it to at least one live race a year, otherwise I'll be watching it down the pub or invite a bunch of mates round for an F1 afternoon with lots of beer and food related to whichever country the race is being held in.
* I help organize a few charity fundraising events a year. One is a charity clay shoot, one is a formal ball type thing with a charity auction, one is a yearly casino night where the house takings go to charity.
* Rocket launching. I host an annual rocket launch for friends, family and their kids to come to my place and fly model rockets made out of junk. Also lots more beer and BBQing.
* Computer games. Not so much lately, but I am partial to a bit of sim-racing and have 4x wheel/pedal rigs set up in my living room for when I do F1 nights. Lately I've been playing Infinifactory, Factorio, GTA V, and KSP.
* Game modding. I've always enjoyed modding the games I play. I used to help Garry Newman with his GMod thing. When it became commercial we were flown over to the US to sign the deal with valve and as an eventual result I was able to get my mortgage fully paid off before I was 30. More recently I've made mods for KSP, ARMA2/3, and some middleware for sim racing games such as Asseto Corsa, Project CARS, etc.
* Open source stuff. I like to play about contributing some of my time &amp; expertise to open source projects. Some of my code was run to generate this exact page as I've contributed to reddit's codebase on numerous occasions.

Having said all that, most of my weekends are currently spent renovating some old buildings I have. A couple I'm turning into rentable industrial units/workshops, one I'm turning into a house which will also be rented out. Doing that doesn't immediately earn me anything so it's something I tend to do in my spare time, but eventually I'll be getting a bit of side-income from it.

However, the monarch does have a duty to produce a legitimate heir of the body. The best way to accomplish this is through a formal triple parenthood agreement, where the monarch has a child with someone outside the marriage who by prior agreement of all three parties is considered a parent to the child along with both partners in the marriage. Doing it this way allows the monarch to be married to the person they want to be, while also producing a deliberate heir acknowledged in advance by everybody involved and who thus cannot be considered illegitimate.

British Columbia has legislation allowing this kind of arrangement to be formalized, and courts in Ontario have granted legal standing to arrangements of this form. I'm not sure what the legal status of this kind of arrangement is in the UK, though. However, since the UK allows babies with three genetic parents (two contributing to the genetic makeup of the nucleus of the zygote, with the third contributing the mitochondrion), this kind of arrangement hardly seems like a stretch.
