Your information uses your NHS number but is not accessible from your NHS records. It is only ever seen by people at the service you access. If you had therapy from Mind in, say, Peterborough, then moved to, say, London, you'd need to re refer and the system would not show any notes from the previous therapy. Your GP, for example, would not ever be able to read your notes from therapy. Ever.

Mind is not CMHT or for serious psychotic breaks, but if you need those services they are good at signposting you to the right service for you. I know this sounds faffy and slow, but the services do talk to each other. It's just that mental health services cover different things.

Mind/Steps for Well Being/italk/IAPT is a psychological well being service.

You can do more than one round of therapy. If you need more, call. It's free. If they can't help you, they'll figure out who can and they'll refer you on.

Add all of that to a squad which features several new players as starters they'll require some time to get going. They very well might be a title contender this season but they're still behind Arsenal and Man City in my opinion.

As for our business, I just think ts hard for us to improve our first 11 mainly because of the type of players we play in the current 11. Costa, Hazard, Fabregas, Matic, Azpilicueta, Filipe Luis and Ivanovic (Yes he is that good) would be comfortable starter for other teams. 

Then we come to the likes of Oscar, Wiliian, Cuadrado who as it looks like will rotate among themselves for game time. Oscar generally is one of the best players in the team in the starting few months and his form starts dwindling around and after December/January. Sort of like what Fabregas experienced at Barcelona. Hopefully he improves his endurance cause he is only gonna get better and more consistent given his age.

Willian is already a top player in what he does. Can anyone name a better player in the league who can press well, run for 90 mins, can keep the ball under pressure and create opportunities with his passing in the opposition half? He is an important player in the current setup and will feature in a lot of games again.

Cuadrado is still acclimatizing and he is a likely starter if he performs to his best (as we have seen from his performances for Colombia and Fiorentina).

Then we come to our defenders whom perform their duties as well as anyone in a deep block but tend to struggle high up the pitch and their lack of ball playing abilities can hurt us against lesser opposition where we possess most of the ball. I definitely think we should go for a worlclass defender ( with necessary athleticism and ball playing attributes) to partner Terry. Perhaps Zouma will develop into a likely starter this season or perhaps Mourinho has his own targets in his mind but they aren't available right now.

Now coming to our squad depth. Mourinho did say he hoped to bring couple of players to provide competition to the starters. We've replaced Cech with Begovic and Drogba with Falcao (nowhere near the 2012 version of him). Nothing significant at all. Now hopefully we'll buy a winger (Rumors about Pedro?) and perhaps a midfielder (Charles Aranguiz?) too but they aren't going to be Di Maria/Bale and Pogba for sure. We can only speculate as to who'll come in and go out but given the current market its gonna be tough to improve on what we have.

No it certainly hasn't. I don't know where you get this idea. 6 months ago Ibe got his first start of the season. Not even sure how the four months leading up to that where he played in the Championship led anyone to believe he had more potential than Sterling.

&gt;Plus, Ibe doesn't shoot like a bitch. Which is a big plus for him. 

Because Ibe started out as a striker as a kid. Sterling has always been a winger and only this year, when Rodgers was acting like a retard, was he forced to play as a lone striker.

You're making sense, but you're still wrong. You can have opinions on players' potential, but that can still be almost definitely right or wrong.

Mitchell just sounds like a nasty piece of work in general rather than being classist and I feel using Mitchell as a point to try and establish all MPs are 'Snobs' has low external validity in hindsight.  

As for Thornberry, I feel to some extent she was the victim of a media witch hunt as she wasn't explicitly obnoxious and it is the individual's interpretation to construe it as discrimination like you said. However, regardless of interpretation, it seems most probable that Miliband did the Labour party no favours by saying he had 'Respect' for someone if they saw someone driving a white van as if it was out of the ordinary and commendable. Granted, they're doing a job and contributing to society; but so does everyone else and I'm hardly going to bow down in respect to the individual removing my 'Unexpected item in bagging area' from the self-service checkout in ASDA.

I completely agree with your point that an overly-sensationalised media greatly influenced both Mitchell and Thornberry's cases which lead to them being blown out of proportion. I also agree that MPs will feel superior to everyone as psychological factors such as deindividuation may be at play and I make brief rereference to Milgram's infamous electrical shock study when I say that factors such as smart clothing and respectable locations of the authoritative figure (MPs wear suits and sit in Parliament) greatly increased the authority of the authoratative figure and this power may lead to it being abused such as Zimbardo's equally infamous mock prison experiment in which participants role played as either a guard or a prisoner and the experiment had to be stopped drastically early due to the guards severely abusing their powers.

Edit: Just noticed your on higher rate, so ignore the annual limit chat. Thing you need to consider is few companies will apply tax relief at the higher rate and you'll need to claim the extra 20/25% back from HMRC at the end of the tax year. Best to do some homework on any providers beforehand to see if you'll be in this boat. 

Personally I don't see much point in contributing beyond the 40k limit if your salary allows as you'll effectively lose the single biggest reason for doing so - tax relief. You'd be far better putting the money to use elsewhere. I'm no adviser but see what they can suggest for you.

null,false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; The move to a ""low fat"" diet, which has involved an increase in the amount of sugar consumed in processed low fat foods, has been a public health disaster.

&gt; A lot of the health problems that used to be associated with saturated fats are increasingly being laid at the door of sugar (particularly fructose eaten without fibre).

Depends on the health problem you mean.
High cholesterol - [a risk factor for heart-disease](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx) - occurs as a result of eating too much saturated and/or trans fat.
There's some discussion about [dietary risk-factors](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-causes.html) (excess fat/excess sugar) for diabetes and the jury's still out.
Causes of cancer, OTOH, vary widely depending on the cancer. As far as dietary causes go, being overweight is a [risk-factor for developing cancer](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/bodyweight-and-cancer), but the reason why someone is overweight may be exercise-related rather than simply diet-related.

&gt; The move to a ""low fat"" diet, which has involved an increase in the amount of sugar consumed in processed low fat foods, has been a public health disaster.

Yeah, but the fault there isn't the science but the advice. Telling people to ""avoid fat"" without additional information isn't good advice. People need to know what kinds of fats there are, how to recognise them (generally speaking if it's a liquid at room temperature then it's unsaturated), to eat fewer saturated fats *in relation to everything else*, and to make sure their diet mainly involves a variety of fresh vegetables (and pototoes don't count as a vegetable).

There's sugar and fat in [broccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli). No-one's going to suggest that eating lots of broccoli will kill you, well not unless you move to a broccoli-only diet. Avoiding all sugar and fat will kill you because your body needs them to survive.

Sterling has just had a season where he was granted a mid-season holiday and skipped out on England internationals because of fatigue (under advice from the club I expect) all in the name of the preventing early burnout Owen complained of.

Now he carries a pricetag and wage packet that could have been used to buy any player in football (with a handful of exceptions at most).

It will take incredible courage for Pellegrini to follow a similar development plan as Rodgers has. Hell it took Rodgers great courage to do it in the midst of such a bad season. 

Manuel's job is in the balance and Sterling is their big name buy. The expectations will multiply by more than his wages have.

In this sale I think England's greatest talent of his generation has  been stunted. That is a tragedy on it's own.

Man City have not got the player we had. He has been changed by the transfer ordeal and won't reach the peak he could have had he stayed with us (I don't mean trophies necessarily, but rather quality).

Someone buying a house to live in, or even to rent, is going to have a ceiling of how much they will pay for a house.  At a certain point they will think that what they are getting for their money isn't enough.  1/2 a Million for a 3 bedroom house in a scruffy area would not seem like a good deal to a lot of people.  An investor though, doesn't care how big the house is or what area it's in.  All an investor is interested in is how fast the prices are going up and how much it'll be worth in a few years time.  That's why you end up paying ridiculous amounts of money for tiny houses that just aren't worth it.  The trouble is that this effect ripples out.  Well, I say ""trouble"", but as I said earlier, it was great for us because we rode the wave outwards, buying slighty bigger houses each time.  The mortgage I have now is virtually the same amount as when we started 15 years ago, but rather than a poky 2 up/2 down terraced house, we've got a large 4 bedroom detached.  Brilliant for us, but our kids are screwed.  The wave is still moving outwards, making more and more houses unaffordable for normal people.  They keep building more houses, but they get swallowed up by the wave almost immediately.

The only solution is to make houses less attractive to investors through tax.  Until then you can build as many as you want, but most people will not be able to afford one because of the vast sums of money they are up against.

“There seems to be a huge appetite for properties in Cambridge from all over the world.”

The 125s are also extremely economical if that's running costs are a concern.

You can do the A2 with no CBT experience, in the form of DAS. The CBT costs little however, you wouldn't be losing money on the 125, I'd suggest weighing up what kind of riding you're most likely to be doing to decide whether, spending the half a grand upwards needed for DAS, is worthwhile.

If you're consuming a lot of miles, on bigger A roads / dual carriageways, I'd consider the DAS. If using a motorway is practical at all for you, I'd recommend the DAS. If you're going to stick to inner-city riding, the CBT will be plenty sufficient.

There's other things to consider though, by getting your A2 license you'll come out the other end with a lot more training which is a lot better than the CBT ( Compulsory **Basic** Training ). Subsequently your insurance costs will be reduced for equivalent sized bikes, but we're after the A2 license for the ability to ride a bigger bike.

I enjoy all this stuff, but I'm never making ""OMG, how amazing is Interstellar. Chris Nolan is the best director ever. If you don't like the dark knight, then fuck you"" type comments on Reddit. I sometimes notice that some of my comments don't fit the natural tone of how I would speak, but I think that's just cos I'm making an effort to try and fit in to certain niches of certain subreddits. For example, I'm a big Kanye West fan and I lurk hiphopheads a lot but very rarely comment because I don't think my ""voice"" would fit in the comments there.

&gt; Foxes are pests

If foxes are pests, why is there need to capture and breed them. I saw it happening before the hunt ban came into force and it still continues to this day.  Here is a report from just a few weeks ago:
http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/videos/2015/june/kidnapped-for-cruelty

&gt; Have you seen how ""humane"" foxes are to their pray? Foxes actually kill for fun. If a fox comes across a bunch of chickens it'll kill every one despite only eating one or two.

Foxes are quite efficient  killers, especially  with  fowl. They usually  grab a bird and snap its neck.

To say  they kill for fun, is rather far  fetched as there are usually  other factors, like scarcity  of food that  come into play. Only  the idiots on horseback kill for fun.

Sure foxes have been known to go on a killing spree, sometimes killing more than  it  consumes that  night. It  does not mean that  this  is done for fun, as it is their  method to preserve  the food supply. Often the fox will bury  a lot  of its kills to keep for another day. To a fox, its very much like doing a big weekly/monthly  shop. 

Strange too that the fox is blamed for its opportunistic behavior, rather than farmers for keeping birds in a coop in the first  place. Though this  is a typical human trait... always me me me.

&gt; Anti-Fox hunting campaigners are often urban folk who really have no insight into rural perspectives or affairs. Is this not pretty damn elitist?

May be shocking to hear, that some of us country  bumpkins are opposed to these blood sports too.

I leased a Toyota, back in 2006 (oddly, not very reliable for a Toyota!). It was one of those ""pay £X per month and you get to keep the car with a final payment at the end"" (pcp) deals. So not totally what you were talking about, but not a million miles away either. After the three years were up, I traded it for a Hyundai (the Hyundai garage payed off the Toyota finance) with another PCP deal.

Whilst owning the Hyundai, I decided to try out caravanning, and loved it. But that Hyundai was no good for caravanning; way too small and light, and so the caravan I paired it with was very small and generally shitty. So when that was due, I was like ""screw it"". I got rid of the Hyundai, and brought a cheap, second (well, third or fourth) hand Citroen C5 for £4k. I never intended to keep it for long, but I still have it today, with my much larger caravan.

Work done on the C5 in the four years I've owned it:
A few bulbs (call it £30)
A Bluetooth adaptor that amazingly runs from my 12V socket: £25.
Citroen switching on aux input so I could use the Bluetooth adapter: £50 (god dammit)
^-- with these two, and a mount for my phone, I now have satnav in my car with instructions coming through the speakers, along with my entire music collection via Google Play Music.
A new brake pedal sensor I fitted myself thanks to Google ~£12
I fitted a parking sensor kit from eBay, £10 (yes, really, and it still works) which I again fitted myself (Citroen had pre-dilled holes in the bumper, haha!)
New battery £100ish.
New clutch and DMF: £600, which was a damn sight cheaper than what Citroen wanted.
Later this year, it'll be 10 years old, and she'll need a new Cambelt, that's been quoted at around £250ish.

Getting a good, local mechanic can really keep the costs in check. Although I didn't know it at the time of purchase, the engine in my car is pretty much bullet proof as long as I look after it, so I've been told.

The car is worth probably £2,500 today. Maybe more, but I've put a fair few miles on the clock, and a newer model has since come out, and I put a characteristic dent in the rear wing. Honestly I don't know or care that much.

So in four years, that's cost me around £1,500ish in depreciation/damage. And £1077 in repairs/running costs. I've left off servicing and fuel as I'd have to pay that anyway with most leases. So that's £22.43/month for the 4 years so far. If I keep going, it'll be less per month, assuming nothing expensive goes wrong. My spare income is a lot higher due to this and I've been investing that money heavily.

Whereas leasing would've cost me a whole lot more, and I don't get to keep the car.

What happens if I lose my job? I can still get to an interview (if I can afford the fuel), which I might not be able to do if I give the car back because I cannot afford it anymore. The roof on my house needed replacing two years ago, that cost a pretty penny I tell you, I'm glad I had the dosh around to pay for it, which I might otherwise not of had, and I would've had to get a loan.

I recently visited a lot of dealerships near me, as I'm thinking I might change the car. That thought quickly disappeared. Well, everything new that I wanted was £20k+. Yes, I can afford it, but would I get £20k worth of enjoyment out of the car versus what I already have? No, I wouldn't. I looked at Motorpoint as well (second hand cars, but most are around a year old), and saw a very tasty VW Passat for around half the list price... Half the price in a year of motoring. 13k on the clock, she was basically brand new. Goes to show how much you lose. Was on for around £13k. Still not worth it when my current car runs just fine. (proof: http://imgur.com/lFolbS9 )

For me, personally, when I can motor for a lot less money overall, and still get 90% of the enjoyment out of it, I cannot justify it to myself to be spending all the money on new cars. I've done it twice, never again (unless there is an exceptionally good reason to do so, but I can't think of any). When the Citroen eventually dies, I'm going second hand, but ""newish"" second hand, and I'll be a cash buyer.

Obviously, this is all for me. You may feel different, and I'm not telling you to go buy a £300 banger and expect it to be fine for the next 20 years. What I am saying is, like many other things in life, there are compromises and choices to be made. You spend the £250/month on a new car, and you get that new car smell, and you get a warranty, and the novelty of owning a new car for 6 months etc. But at what opportunity cost? If it really worth all that extra money against buying something that's quality and second hand for a few grand?

I suppose that is fine for those of you happy in the quagmire, only looking out for you and yours sometimes it isn't enough.

 I don't know the answers, maybe most of us tuning in are just not mature or developed enough to think about the other side of the class divide. Just unquestioningly accepting or never even giving the thought that their superiors in the higher classes are anything else other than ""better""people and that they couldn't be as morally repugnant as these doleys?

I've heard people (mainly through this r/MotoUK) go straight to A2 without any experience and you have some experience from doing a CBT 2 years ago so you could just go get some lessons and then do a 5 day course to do the test

If you really want to get your own bike to practice first before you attempt the test its not a bad idea either, you'll have the coming of age feeling when you finally change up from a 125 I guess lol.

Do you want to be riding a 125cc for 2 years like you say? the main difficulty being motorway journeys to and from Uni wherever that might be, and obviously you'll get bored of the power less than 500 miles of riding it

In terms of money the only place you'll really waste it is in insurance and servicing (road tax and depreciation of the bike are pretty minimal if you buy a second hand bike) One thing to consider is how much is insurance on a 125 now compared to on a A2 restricted bike when you have a full licence?

Another option is to rent a 125 for a week or two?

Which is problem, because although *fruit* with it's added fibre can be healthier for you (in limited amounts), most juices and smoothies are barely better than soft drinks.

Fundamentally it's the wrong attitude as well, that adding sugar is bad, as opposed to the amount of sugar. If I can add sugar to a drink, but come in at less than other drinks with no added sugar then it's probably a better option.

Money isn't an issue however I don't have the upfront money to buy second-hand or pay a huge deposit, so I'm more geared towards doing finance on a new bike (hence I chose the YZF R125 as it has 8.9%APR from Yamaha finance which is nice).

I agree with you on the A2 experience, it's invaluable. To be honest, most of my riding will be inner-city with the occasional motorway (although on CBT it would be dual carriageway) ride back home and back again (about 200 mile round trip).

Half a grand seems like a lot just for the privellage of riding a bigger bike, especially when there's no guarntees of passing (I was pretty shaky on my CBT, but then again I hadn't had ANY driving experience, bike or otherwise).

Uni is about 250 miles there and back, all dual-carriageways (could take the M1 but the old A1 will do!).

How much is this 5 day course? Someone said below it's half a grand, in which case I'm not too sure, although when you think about it the CBT is a hundred odd, and an A1 is probably 200 or something. 

I don't mind riding a 125 for however long, but It seems a little unproductive and a waste to get a 125 when I'm old enough to get a bigger bike and get some enjoyment out of it and get experience for when I'm 21.

I could rent a 125, that's a pretty good idea-- although I'm not sure how much experience that would give me If I would still need to do the 5-day course. And that deposit I won't have, and I don't suppose you can put your car down as a deposit.

As somebody who has been riding for 15years daily I can't help but think if you need to post this it was partially your fault, regardless of if the car was in the right or the wrong.

As bikers, we HAVE to have a larger situational awareness than the average car driver. This also applies to the weather. By the tone of your post (thinking it may have been the wet weather) lends me to think that you've not long been riding and grabbed a handful of front brake and low-sided? (worse still if it was the rear)

IF you think a car is even slightly not going to stop then don't make the turn? If it's wet don't just use the front brake and if you are heavy planting the front ensure you're not locking it. 

As you and the bike are fine (thankgod) then maybe some braking practice in the wet will help you and your confidence levels? Apply 75/25 or 50/50 rules as normal and get used to being heavy on the front...

Trapping is less humane since the trapped animal is caught for up to 24 hours (if you lay a trap, you're legally required to check it at intervals of no more then 24 hours), but 20-23 hours is still a long time for an animal to be trapped and stressed before you return and shoot it in the trap.

Shooting is more humane than hunting with dogs - fox is walking along and next moment it's lights out, no stress.

The rules as they are currently look something like this:

* The employer must be registered to apply for visas, and only certain employers who can demonstrate a need for overseas workers are allowed to register. The NHS is not on this list as far as I am aware. But I'll outline the rest for completeness.
* If the employer can register they must advertise the job throughout the entire EU and they must demonstrate that they couldn't find anyone suitable to do the job.
* If the employer meets both of the above conditions then they can apply for one of a very small number of visas that get snapped up very quickly on release.

Well, under this argument, fibre (cellulose) is also a sugar.

At the level of abstraction you are arguing for, you have lost the distinction between alpha and beta linkages; the effect of chain length (which plays into the differences between alpha and beta amalyse; hence into difference in digestion).  It also ignores the stearic hindrance of branched chain carbohydrates on enzyme action.  Those of us who are lactose intolerant will have personal experience that not all sugars are the same.

In other words: your argument means that eating _wood_ would be a good source of 'sugars'.  This is clearly incorrect, and therefore shows that your argument is incorrect in some way.

Nothing changes the process of energy in/energy out. What you eat really doesn't make a difference at all. If you pancreas is faulty or you have another disease that affects how your body processes food, your doctor will determine whether your body needs a different calorie count or not. (Often it doesn't, but you may need a different diet (same calories, different products) to make sure you're getting all necessary nutrients.) Once you know how many calories to eat, it's exactly the same process as everyone else. 

It doesn't matter what a salad is. You can replace it with any type of food. Have apples until you've reached your amount of calories. Or pizzas. Or carrots. Literally doesn't matter one bit. The amount of calories matters, not what's in those calories. (for weight loss strictly, general health is another thing entirely)
If you feel good on your low carb diet, good on you. I can assure you that if you were to eat the same amount of calories in only carbs you'd lose just as much.

Buy what you can afford right now, that means you should be looking at having a solid two grand for the bike, insurance, and gear.

You're going to drop your 125 plenty, doing so on a new will bike will crush you. Do it on a used bike that's been previously dropped, no biggie. It's a learner bike.

Walk out of the door with your newly financed bike, you've lost what you paid for VAT instantly. Buy used and from a private seller, and you're not buying with the seller's additional markup for what they bought the bike for.

I'd also suggest avoiding the sporty 125s, such as the YZFR125, they really do not go much faster if at all than the typical staple 125s. They also cost more to purchase because they attract a particular demographic, they cost more to insure because of this and because those plastic fairings are stupid expensive to replace.

Part of the A2 is the ability to use the road, non-specific to riding a motorcycle. Having driving experience will play to your strength.

As for being ready, bigger bikes are steadier and the weight difference isn't noticeable as soon as you begin moving. You're going to be bullied about by the wind less, you're going to have the power to escape dangerous situations ( ie cars keeping you in their blind spot, having to overtake ), and there are plenty bikes out there that are 'big' but docile just like the ones used by instructors for DAS.

Whoever gave away his personal number is the worst type of ""fan.""  Those who contributed are just as bad. I felt just as hurt, but this is his livelihood. 

When Sterling played for our club he was the tops. For at least two or three weeks he was our sole goal scorer, before Cotinho found his own. 

Now I don't like Sterling (jealousy), but he is a great player. I only hope he ditches that toxic influence that ward is. 

I also hope he never scores another goddamn goal at anfield. 

Either way, he really does have a bright future ahead of him. Just has a shitty attitude as well. He isn't even good enough to be the next Costa (shitty attitude), but we have all seen how Hendo deals with those cunts......

I hope Raheem learns. He helped our club so much. I was being naïve with my post. That's fine. Peeps need to remember the difference between Liverpool and these other shit clubs. We have a loyal fan base. A knowledgeable fan base. A decent fan base. Well so far. 

Edit: I really feel that all this horrible fan ""feed-back"" help precipitate this utter bull shit situation. Of course Ward did too, but Raheem didn't feel welcome no mores.

Reason I've had my mind set on finance is because unfortunately I don't have the upfront cash for what the CBT (and A2 If I do it), plus gear, and then the bike on top. I have however, got the money to finance and pay in monthly instalments, which for the YZFR125 is roughly around the £100 a month mark, with insurance is about 120/140 a month.

Might seem like a lot, but after 2 years I can sell it back to the lease company or buy it off them and sell it myself for more than they'd give me for it. I know you can do finance on second-hand bikes, but honestly I don't see the point when I can get a brand-new one which will be faultless.

I agree It'll be dropped, but I'm not looking to be an idiot on it and I've heard you can get protectors to put on the side so when you drop it, it just falls on them 9 times out of ten.

My dielemma is, the R3 (which is the same bike really, but obviously (twice?) the power, and a bit more value for your money as it is nearly exactly the same price as the 125. So I really have to weigh up whether the A2 license will be worth it to get the R3 (or something else).

The recent kerfuffle in other less civilised (!) parts of this site has only reinforced that for me - and to be honest, after a quick skim of the new management's aims and objectives for the future of the site made my skin crawl.  I'll give this place a month or so and see what comes out in terms of new policies, but I think my time here is almost done.  Not that I'll be missed, I'm not sure I've broken into double digit posts, but I'm sure there's a number of people in the same boat (indeed, other communities are also having these sorts of discussions).

If there was an alternative with a critical mass of well constructed content, with users respectful of people's opinions and with quality content, I'd be gone already.  But as much as I've filtered down what I 'get' from Reddit, I can't avoid the fact that there's all sorts of dark corners here and that they spill over to pollute the site sporadically - and increasingly so more recently.

And I just don't want to support that anymore.  It's not healthy either for those users here for honest discussion (on the generally better mannered subs), and it's not good for the long term future of this place as a whole.  Reddit needs to take a stance - and soon - on what it wants to be.

If it's going to be a libertarian, free speech for all and ruled by the loudest, most brigading users out there, that's fine for them.  But I think personally that's a step backwards for Reddit as a company - and as a community, so I won't be here.

If we can get some solid harassment and clearer content policies out of the recent changes that address some of the issues with off site organisation and brigading, racism and hate speech - great.  It's been needed for a good 4 years+ at this point and I can't help but think that if a stronger stance had been taken years ago, Reddit wouldn't be where it is now (eg, /all covered in racist and harassing posts against the ex CEO and specific subs set up to abuse her in the last few weeks).",null,0,null,1436781241,null,0,false,0,ct1k97m,null,t3_3d3lay,null,t1_ct1k97m,null,t3_3d3lay,null,null,null,1437815650,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Public transport.....depends where you want to go. If you're only considering commuting to work and that's in the city centre itself AND you live in the city centre then you shouldn't encounter any problems. It's when you increase the distance of either work or home from the centre itself that you'll *potentially* experience difficulties. Public transport isn't our strongest asset. Not a patch on Europe. However, bare in mind we are a small country and everywhere in Belfast city centre is walking distance.

House prices are high in Belfast but that's to be expected. There's always people looking for flat/housemates. The university area will be your best bet for cheap housing but you get what you pay for.... Speak to your work about that. Get in touch with employees with the company who work here. 

Don't worry about sectarianism, we hate each other, not tourist/foreigners. As with anywhere, stay away from the shit holes or 'ghettos' here and you'll be fine. Well as long as you don't provoke people which leads me on to football....

Talking shite and particularly about football (soccer) is a good characteristic for here but there is a link with sectarianism. Generally avoid openly discussing Glasgow Rangers and Glasgow Celtic and you'll be fine. You may be wondering why talking about football from a city in a different country is a problem. Well, we are knobs and this is part of the problem you've been reading about.

Come on over and check us out. We are lovely and our wee country is....quirky :)

The catch is that you have to pay in £1750 a month, but that can be the same £1000 that you deposit and transfer out then transfer back in a few times.

I'd suggest putting in the minimum £25 to get your £10/month bonus. Then, you can put upto £250/month (£3000/year) into a 6% saver as that gives you 4.8% effective interest (assuming standard tax).

If you want to save more than the regular saver allows, I'd suggest looking at the Santander 123 account.

At the very least, a chat with a decent GP may go someway towards setting your mind at ease a little - and it will help to have your current situation documented, should things change in the coming weeks.

It's not unheard of to need a slight increase in dosage as your body becomes accustomed to the medication, or perhaps in cases, a change in SSRI should the Citalopram not be doing it's job.  Your GP is the one who can best advise you on this and an honest chat with them is definitely needed.

In addition to the above - and as others have suggested, try calling your local branch of MIND.  They can help you secure cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness training, both of which are worth trying in addition to the SSRI.  If you don't fancy contacting MIND, there will be patient accessible arm of the NHS that also works in this area called 'Increased Access to Psychological Therapies' (IAPT).

Apart from the obvious reason that a lot of our youth will soon be 21 and count against the 25-man senior player cap, I think we will get enough from the likes of Sterling, Lopes, Pozo, and Denayer this year to be targeting at most one more senior HG signing. 

All the useful and quasi-realistic options at CM aren't HG, so maybe we should be looking for a senior HG player that can be in competition for a starting spot at LB or on the wing.

The problem is that there is a multi-billion pound industry which wants to drive the global economy at full-speed into the ecological wall because they are terrified of the consequences of not doing so.  Unfortunately, their spending is having an effect on the popular perception as to whether there is a problem, the nature of it, and how to deal with it, all of which are becoming increasingly unrealistic and diverging from the scientific understanding of the reality.  Changing this around by polite protest is becoming increasingly untenable and more and more people who care about such things are realising this and becoming more radical in their approach.

It'll be a cold day in hell before that happens. More likely, the government will just crack down hard on them. And I'd support them doing that if this continued - Heathrow is vital to the economy and we can't allow undemocratic protests to stuff things up.

**Contradictions of the Conservatives’ housing policy**

*Osborne’s Budget has done too little to boost the supply of new homes*

Britain urgently needs to build more homes. Any discussion of the UK’s housing crisis must focus unswervingly on the lack of supply. Over the past decade, the population has increased sharply, boosting demand for houses to rent or own, especially in the south-east. But successive governments have been unwilling to confront vested interests — most notably existing homeowners — who resist new developments. A mere 141,000 homes were constructed in the UK last year, well below the 230,000 that must be built annually if scarcity is not to grow.

In their approach to this problem, the Conservatives have been found wanting. Government policy has focused on boosting demand rather than supply, subsidising first-time buyers with policies such as “right to buy” “help to buy” and “rent to own”. In last week’s Budget, George Osborne recognised the need for measures to help build homes. But the chancellor is still doing too little to boost supply while one new policy — a sharp reduction in the rents charged by Britain’s social landlords — may worsen the problem.

The chancellor deserves credit for loosening the UK’s rigid planning regulations. Mr Osborne has tried to shift the balance towards new developments by unveiling a new zonal system where developers will receive automatic planning permission on all suitable brownfield sites. Councils will be fined if they do not make decisions on planning applications quickly enough, and they will be given stronger compulsory purchase powers to take control of land for development.

These are welcome measures — and brave, too, since they may antagonise the Nimbyish tendency among Tory supporters. But they do not go far enough. Britain’s housing shortage will only be properly addressed if the government admits that building should be allowed on the UK’s abundant green spaces. There is little in the new planning rules to indicate this will happen.

In the meantime, the stance that Mr Osborne has taken towards housing associations risks exacerbating the supply problem. Housing associations are not-for-profit private landlords who manage a large part of Britain’s social housing stock. Ministers have never been enamoured of the sector, believing it charges high rents that are largely funded by housing benefit payments to tenants. Earlier this year, the Conservatives took a first swipe at the associations, declaring they must give tenants the right to buy their homes. Now Mr Osborne is going further by imposing a 1 per cent cut in the rents that housing associations can charge every year for the next four years.

By cutting social rents in this way, Mr Osborne aims to reduce the housing benefit bill by £4.3bn by 2021. That is understandable. But his policy will cut the supply of new homes, too. Housing associations build one in five of all new homes in the UK. The way in which they finance construction programmes is to borrow against future rents. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the drop in guaranteed rental income is likely to lead to housing associations abandoning plans to build 14,000 new homes. The National Housing Federation says the figure is closer to 27,000.

Mr Osborne’s housing policy looks confused. The government spends £1.4bn a year subsidising people trying to buy a home, but cuts rental subsidies for those on benefits. While the government tries to boost housebuilding by shaking up the planning system, its attack on housing associations will reduce construction. Britain’s housing shortage is an immense economic challenge that requires a lot of joined-up thinking in government. There is little to suggest this is happening.

Uni should be what it was: a place for the top 20% or so to go and further knowledge in relevant fields. Instead it's a place for nice kids to go and do English Lit or whatever.

We should be far more selective and funding should be targetted at relevant courses. That doesn't mean no English Lit students, but far less of them compared to STEM subjects.

I went to Uni hoping to have philisophical discussions with smart people, instead I met a bunch of twats doing Geography and Sports Science who just got pissed. My tax money shouldn't be paying for that.

Free education for required subjects and subjects that have a proven return to the economy (basically STEM), charge fees for the less important courses that people want to do, cull all the crap courses. Take the cash and invest it in apprenticeships and proper vocational education from 14.

null,false,RajaRajaC,null,null,null,"&gt;The UK was far wealthier than than the countries it took over - that's how it manged to take them over.

Wrong. If you look at Angus Maddison's global economic values, the British GDP tracks Indian GDP till about the 1700's which is when there is a small bump. The exponential growth however happens from 1800 on (which is when she gained the bulk of her colonies)

1800-1850 - British GDP grows by 10%. However in the period 1850 to 1900, it doubles and from 1800 to 1850 it doubles yet again. In essence it near about quadruples in a 100 years. Compare this with another industrial power Germany - from 1850 to 1914 and the rise is far less impressive (impressive no doubt, but in relation to Britain).

Eric Hobsbawm in his seminal trilogy clearly makes the case for how colonisation helped the mother countries (for lack of a better word). In his age of revolutions, he explains how the key driver of the British economy was cotton and how Cotton exports increased 10 times over in a span of 50 odd years (and that is just one example). Where did Britain get access to that huge a market? Its colonies.

In the Age of Capital he talks (and in Revolutions) he talks about how Britain engineered policies that crippled and destroyed Indian industry and agriculture but helped Britain immeasurably.

&gt;Yes, the colonial governments were pretty crap, but they were not as crap as the corrupt indigenous governments

Sorry but that is a lot of horse manure. India for instance had kingdoms that had advanced administrative set ups, while at the same time Europe, including Britain had crappy, corrupt indigenous governments.  To act as though Britain (and the ""west) had some enlightened governments across all history while all native ones were corrupt benighted ones is just hubris tempered by ignorance.

&gt; Yes, there was a lot of violence and brutality, but the locals were engaged in pretty much constant warfare already.

Agree, should I also remind you that the two bloodiest wars in human history, one of which included wholesale genocide and terror bombing (brutality 101) was fought in Europe, amongst European powers just...69 years ago?

Wars were, are a constant in humans and is a human failing.

&gt;but the costs incurred by empire were enormous and there was always debate about whether it was worth the cost.

&gt;The British set things up so they were economically favorable, but the costs incurred by empire were enormous and there was always debate about whether it was worth the cost.

Wrong again! Firstly, the British made the rules such that India (and other colonies) bore the costs of occupation. 

India for instance had to pay for all garrisoning costs (which included native regiments, not just British units), it had to pay for all ""administrative costs"" which was the cost of the ICS (Indian Civil Service), Britain imposed very heavy duties on goods imported from Britain - which meant that India paid between 15-25% (based on the duties prevailing) more for every finished product. On top of this shit cake came the cream - India also had to pay a ""contribution"" to the British domestic budget.

Now keep in mind, as late as 1931, India had only a 200,000 UK people (including the Scots and the Irish here) to govern a nation of some 800 mn, so the costs to run the empire was hardly crippling.

After all this, let us consider the lie that India was never industrialised and it was some primitive nation with zero exports to speak of. Yes, India did not have an economy as industrialised as say Britain, but it had a vibrant and robust handicraft industry which manufactured and exported everything from Wootz Steel to Linen and cotton textiles.

Britain killed these, but...never replaced them with a robust indengenous industrial manufacturing base, thereby pushing India into an agrarian economy. Britain in other words, 'de-industrialised' India.

We then have the famines caused by British policies, the death of Indian soldiers in wars caused by European imperialism etc, but we will leave these for another day.

&gt; As far as I'm aware your body will always target carbohydrates first when expending energy. Therefore an overly carb heavy meal can and will prevent fat from being burned if you're consuming too many calories.

That's kind of true but you're still confused about how it works.  The primary fuel source is carbs and in the absense of carbs your body will produce ketones in order to run off fats.

11/12: Newcastle, Spurs

OK so Everton and AV were nowhere last season. Pool are in and out, Suarez got them to UCL once (not to mention, we beat them last season). Newcastle got relegated and were terrible last season. City = Money, they were just building at that point.  
  
So where are spurs? We are there every time regardless of managerial turmoil, losing our best players, poor signings, injuries....plenty of excuses  
  
The top 4 have WAY more money than us. So I am optimistic because we perform at a consistently high level in a very difficult league. So yes, I am resigned to our fate of being awesome and competitive every season. We didn't bottle our chance, we came 4th and missed out on UCL because Cuntski won it that year. Then we missed 4th by 1 point the year after. I think we got very unlucky. What do we do now? New stadium, youth core, great signings, sustainable management. I really can't feel pessimistic right now in the context. Could be a lot worse! Look at the other teams I just mentioned in their short term. Let's lock in 5th year in year out, sign cool players, back the manager, until it happens for us. COYS

I started off at 10mg but I'm now on 20mg. It took me a while to get used to the first lot and then settle in before I could decide that I would benefit from a higher dose.

I also went to CBT. There's a long waiting list on the NHS, and it took me a long time to even get round to calling up and getting myself on it, but in the end the CBT was really helpful for me. Even before we got onto management techniques I felt better, just to be able to vent and to be told that everything is fine and normal and I'm not going to go insane or die. I would walk out of CBT with such a spring in my step and a smile on my face like nothing else.

Later, as I improved, I joined a keep fit group. This was once my worst nightmare. I'm not sporty, at all. I am so crippling self-aware and self-conscious that the thought of even contacting them made me feel sick. But in the end I did it, and I felt great. I did something that terrified me, it improved my confidence no end. I felt 'normal'. And best of all, the endorphins from exercise were incredible. Try working out in your own privacy and see if it helps. 

Most of all - do not panic. (I know those words probably piss you off). You are not alone, the world is terrifying to a lot more people than you realise. You can do this. Other people are not judging you, they are in their own bubble fighting their own demons. There is a way out, and you will find it. One day you'll look back on this and be proud of how far you have come. Anxiety, nausea, heart racing, sweating, shaking, choking silence used to be my default. Recently, I got nervous for something and I suddenly realised that I hadn't felt that way in months. Much like when you have a crippling headache, take some paracetamol, then a couple hours later you realise it's gone but don't remember it leaving. Don't give up!

So sure - sugary drinks can trigger a catastrophic failure of a system, but it's a system put under stress by eating too much saturated fat.

Eric Hobsbawm's argument (for one) is that the Industrial Revolution even took place because the European powers had colonies that could act as a base for cheap raw materials and a never ending marketplace for finished goods. Think about it, British textile industry expanded some 10 times in barely 50 years. Where do you think the raw materials came from, and who do you think purchased these goods?

[Growth and Interaction in the World Economy. Angus Maddison, p2:](http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/other_books/Growth_and_Interaction_in_the_World_Economy.pdf)

&gt; Western ascension was not a sudden takeoff but a very lengthy process, with average per capita income rising nearly threefold from 1000 to 1820 compared with a rise of a third in the Rest. Eleventh century income levels were lower in the West than the Rest. By 1820, they were twice as high. Europe overtook Chinese levels in
the fourteenth century.

Ask yourself this: if India was as advanced as you say (I mean in terms of administration and production), how is it that the kingdoms fell one after another to Britain. How did a tiny country come to dominate much of the rest of the world? Yes Britain was aggressive, but it was also very powerful (for its size).

Britain's wealth came about first and foremost because of the industrial revolution - which started in the UK. But it was not just production, but also a revolution in administration and organization (and commerce). 

Of course Britain gamed the Empire for commercial benefit. And of course the British applied their industrial prowess to killing and subjugating the natives. But the prowess came first. It had to - there's no other rationale that works.

It pretty much always has been, but previously it was always a bit of a hassle to change banks.

---

I've changed banks three times in the last 5-6 years.

* I was originally banking with HSBC and had been for maybe 15 years. Some ~5 years ago they closed my local branch so in protest I closed all my accounts and switched to Natwest (who at the time were championing their UK-based call-centres and willingness to retain local village branches).
* This March Natwest closed my village branch and requested that everyone use the one in the nearest town 30 mins away.
* In June they sold off the car-park in that branch making it almost impossible to visit by car (not without paying for parking and walking an extra 5-10 mins to/from the bank.
* Last month I switched again to Santander, who still have a branch in my village 5 mins away, and another branch in my next-nearest village, and another one in the village after that.

I don't think many banks realise how many folks need regular access to a physical branch (mostly self-employed folks like myself, small businesses, independent retailers, the elderly, etc).

They seem to still be relying on bank loyalty to allow them to shutter up the majority of their small local branches. Maybe they're under the assumption that as long as their competitors are doing the same they can all get away with it.

Well, I for one will keep changing who I bank with to whomever has the best local presence and most supports local small businesses.

The solar plane, in particular, highlights exactly how limited renewables are.  The plane took weeks to get anywhere because it was so slow, transported 1 person who endured a lot of physical discomfort during the flight and has proven technically unreliable as the batteries have kept needing to be repaired.  Compare this to a 747, which can happily transport people back and forth across the atlantic day after day without any problems at all.

Technological innovation has only ever increased global CO2 levels.  This is the only possible interpretation of the keeling curve, which frankly is the only metric that matters in this regard, CO2/$GDP being physically meaningless.  We can't decouple, so we need to use less, and we use less by doing less.

It's eminently possible for a fox to cross a 2 hour-old drag scent.

After all, before the ban - when they were deliberately hunting for live foxes, a scent any more than an hour old would probably be worthless as the fox would be long gone.

Drag runners get a decent headstart to account for the fact they're much slower than the horses following them. If a fox is there to be caught, and it's trail crosses the drag scent, odds are it won't be much before the runners come through, or indeed may be after.

The fact hunts have been prosecuted for chasing foxes on a drag hunt means it does happen and as we've established, the only time a prosecution will ever occur is when that particular hunt is being monitored especially closely by a special interest group of sabs.

So if it happens enough that it's been prosecuted for, then it's a statistical certainty that it will have happened several times when there is no monitoring (because what are odds of it only happening when there are sabs chasing them!)?

It's well understood in Statistics that if something occurs when you collect data, it will also occur when you don't collect data (outside of specific cases where the data collection causes the thing you are measuring. Hunt monitoring is not in this category).

Take a look at Vehicle Excise Duty, the cost of the duty (tax) goes up based on the amount of emissions your vehicle creates. So if you want to drive a big 4X4 with terrible MPG, then so be it, but you pay more to do so than I do in my little hatchback. 

This is the old argument over the cost of something versus the price of something. Smoking is taxed because it costs money to treat illnesses that are caused by smoking (the 'amusing' issue being though that because smokers die younger they actually cost the NHS less overall due to a lack of geriatric care and so this is actually a rather poor example) and so instead of paying the cost of some toasted tobacco, you're also paying towards the price of your end of life care.

So yes, again you're right, ultimately only rich people can afford to waste their money on killing themselves sooner as to them it's more affordable. I don't really see the problem with that. Eating ""properly"" should be the more economical option. That way, if you're hard up, you aren't having to feed your kids shit just because that's all you can afford.

null,false,pheasant-plucker,eng-sussex,"Sussex (Hove, Actually)",null,"&gt; If your argument is Britain's colonies did not help it prosper AT the cost of the colonies, it is a foolish one to make

It's not. As I said in my original post:

&gt; The British set things up so they were economically favorable, but the costs incurred by empire were enormous and there was always debate about whether it was worth the cost.

And yes, I know they got the colonies to pay for the costs. The constant debate is over whether the costs were truly covered. Arguably not - Britain sank a lot of wealth into maintaining national pride - huge navy etc. Although there was a lot of wealth at the top, many Britons were grindingly poor.

However, the points you make are all true and I don't disagree. These things went hand in hand. 

My point is that the British empire came about because the British had unique advantages in terms of GNP - not just through industry but in terms of how society operated.

Rember the Empire we're talking about was not the first, but the second. Britain had previously established an Empire in North America. They lost that empire while the Indian one was very small. But the US remained an important trading - and, importanly, innovation - partner. 

It's a myth to say that the relative poverty of india is largely because of the rule of the British. 

Thailand is poor, Germany is wealthy But that's not due to empire building. These regions went on divergent paths, and are now converging. Europe was wealthy, Britain was uniquely placed to take advantage of this to forge an empire first in North America, then in Asia and Africa.

&gt;how is it that the kingdoms fell one after another to Britain. 

Law of unintended consequences. Now, India is just the same as any large geopolitical entity. It has long periods lasting centuries when it was 1 or 2 (sometimes 3) consolidated entities, but it had short periods (of about 50-100 years) when these empires fell and you had utter chaos and a power vaccum.

The seeds of this defeat were sown way back in 1700 when Akbar's grandson, Aurangazeb ascended the throne after defeating Dara Shikoh. Aurangazeb was a religious tyrant, bigot and an expansionist. His policies caused massive strife and rebellions to open up. While he managed to put them down, he left a very weakened centre.

Barely 50 years after his death, two competing empires (Maratha and Sikhs) opened shop and the race was on.

Now is when we enter a period of internecine warfare which was so devestating to all. Even then the Maratha's managed to establish peace in their rather large realm...barely, when the Afghans invaded. In 1761, in the third battle of Panipat, the Marathas were decimated. It was this weakened force the British took on in the First Anglo Maratha war.

Despite your claims to how strong they were, the British were roundly defeated by the Marathas in this war and had to sue for peace. What did happen was the British played off the remaining strong kingdoms against another. The Kingdom of Mysore for instance roundly defeated the British in the first Anglo Mysore war, but the British managed to get the Marathas in the war with them and the Marathas defeated the Mysoreans. Similarly the British enlisted other Indian kingdoms in their war against the Sikhs.

Divide and Rule is how the British defeated all native kingdoms.

&gt;Britain's wealth came about first and foremost because of the industrial revolution - which started in the UK. But it was not just production, but also a revolution in administration and organization (and commerce).

No arguments here- quite a few technical revolutions drove the industrial revolution. Point being, without the colonies Britain would not have had an economy the size it did as the colonies acted as a source of cheap raw material and a market for finished goods. The industrial economy is about scale, and the colonies provided the scale.

&gt;Of course Britain gamed the Empire for commercial benefit. And of course the British applied their industrial prowess to killing and subjugating the natives.

You are confusing issues - in places like Africa, yes, the Brits (and other colonial powers) decimated native powers. In India, the existing empires like Maratha, Mysore and Sikh all had industrial era arms (rifles, artillery etc), and it was more tapping into the existing faultlines rather than outright military power that won them the country.",null,0,null,1436785578,null,0,false,0,ct1laib,null,t3_3d3xhm,null,t1_ct1laib,null,t1_ct1l16m,null,null,null,1437816340,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

* To dream of **Monster Trucks** indicates that you don't let people get in your way when you decide you're going to do something...

The IPCC estimates a global average of about [2 tons per capita](http://www.theccc.org.uk/2014/11/25/the-ipcc-report-and-the-uk-2050-target/) is an upper limit to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and frankly I think this is optimistic.  So we're miles from being anywhere near having respectable environmental credentials.  We're not the worst, true, but that's hardly something to be proud of.

Moreover, the third runway locks us in to much higher air traffic for a long period of time.  Path dependence is important when thinking about things like climate change.

I don't think your mum is necessarily wrong - for some being forced to interact with others can help, eg in a job, because you learn that bad things don't happen. This probably only works if it's not too severe (if you completely lose the ability to speak or have a panic attack in that situation then it's probably not for you, but it depends how supportive the environment is). 

For me it's a supportive environment that seems to help the most. It's trying to be social and being somewhere where when I start panicking, or when I can't physically speak because it's so bad the people around me don't care, and help me through it instead of being all judging and saying I'm weird. But I spent years slowly teaching myself that people don't care so that I can take their  reactions at face value. Years convincing myself that my friends don't all secretly hate me, realising that they probably wouldn't try and hang around with me if they did, and that I can't change it if they do. 

Some things I would tell myself a decade ago (before I got much better on the anxiety front, I still get it now but it's less common and only with new people or situations):

* Most people don't notice, most people don't care, they are concerned about their own lives, not yours, they are thinking about their own worries and barely even paying attention. 
* Those that care fall into one of two groups - the ones who view it negatively, there's nothing you can do about that. The others that care are concerned, maybe because they've been there and know how you're feeling and wish there was something they could do. 
* Not everyone will like you. Do you like everyone you meet? No-one is liked by everyone. So there is nothing to gain from worrying or obsessing over the people that don't like you. 
* You are not special. You are also not weird, 'broken' or deficient in some way, it's common, lots of people suffer it, you probably see people every day that are battling similar things inside, you probably know people who are going through the same thing yet don't know it. Some hide it better than others, some hide it exceedingly well then break down the moment they shut their door behind them. 

It's retraining your brain to see things differently and to react differently. This is what CBT does and it may seem stupid when you'd start, like you don't believe these things so how could it work but it does, it takes time but you can retrain your brain to make it easier. 

The right meds can also take time, I'm on my 6th anti-depressant (depression is my main problem), what works for someone doesn't necessarily work for someone else and it can take a distressingly long time to find the right one for you. I also take propranolol to treat my chronic migraines, but it probably helps the anxiety too.

null,false,RajaRajaC,null,null,null,"&gt;It's a myth to say that the relative poverty of india is largely because of the rule of the British.

The GDP of India barely increased in a 100 years (I think the figure is more like a 0.5% annual increase for a century). India had zero, and I mean zero industrial base in 1947 and had to build from scratch. Its agriculture had to be rebooted because British policies forced food crop generation and this was only causing wave after wave of famine. They entirely ignored social areas like education - India had a literacy rate of 12% in 1947 and again this had to be rebuilt from scratch.

A 100 years of British ruled had transfered a lot of the wealth OUT OF India with next to nothing to show for it, given this basis, it is very logical to argue that the relative poverty of India is largely because of the rule of the British.

Also the argument that others did it, and India hasn't is disingenuous. It is much easier to turn around a city state like Singapore or a relatively tiny country as compared to taking up the cause of 800 Mn people as was the population of India in 1947.

That said, yes, India could have done much much more - look at the rapid strides China has made for comparision.

I've liked him since his first album. The College Dropout was one of the defining albums of my teenage years and it was the catalyst for getting me into listening to rap music. When it comes to music in general I value the beats overs lyrics, and Kanye's songs have extremely well produced beats in them.

He started out as a producer so he knows how to make a song. He is responsible for the beat on one of my favourite Jay Z tracks [""Lucifer""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVtaQ4du0bE). And that quality continues into his own work whether that's released singles or album tracks. Everyone knows [Gold Digger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY). Everyone knows [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g). Everyone knows [Jesus Walks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g). But everyone should know [Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc65hFCls8E), [Blame Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0Diud2z0w) and [I Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2cs9LGJEQ0). The quality is there. But I think people let some of his actions cloud their judgement on the quality of his music.

And here is the biggest crux of any conversation concerning Kanye West, his ego. Kanye West's ego is both his biggest strength and his biggest liability. The positive side results in a person who strives for perfection in his work and performances. The negative sides result in stuff like the Taylor Swift incident (which technically he was right about) and the Beck incident. I'm not excusing his actions, he can be a proper knobhead at times, I just think there is a grudge against him that not a lot of people are willing to forgive, even when someone like Taylor Swift has forgiven him.

Kanye's work by itself should be appreciated. Couple that with Kanye West the person, and he still deserves recognition, even despite his negatives. Every artist has their negatives, John Lennon was a wife beater but I still like The Beatles (though I am biologically obliged to anyway). I get why people don't like him, and by association don't like his work, but he isn't as bad as he is made out to be. My request to anyone who has a strong dislike of him is to be a bit more open minded, there is some good stuff in there.

I hope that made sense anyway. I gave it a quick reread and it seemed to be ok apart from some bad structuring.

TL:DR - Kanye has made some good songs. Give them a listen",null,0,null,1436786163,null,0,false,0,ct1lg2z,null,t3_3d3lay,null,t1_ct1lg2z,null,t1_ct1kcpn,null,null,null,1437816456,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

She was asking if the SNP would be voting on the matter, to which the SNP representative said that its the position to not vote on matters like this, but that some issues had arrisen under the bill which might affect Scotland. Then she goes on to ask why they would vote on the bill. Hurr he just told you, because some aspects of the bill might affect his constituents.

You can feel bad on certain diets for sure. Some people may feel better eating certain foods because their body is better at processing them. (I have to avoid some leafy greens and pop for example) If you were to eat a diet of only pizza, you'd feel bad after a while because deficiencies would start kicking in among other things. How you feel and the amount of calories you burn are two entirely different things though.

It doesn't matter whether hormones affect weight gain or loss. You adjust your calorie count if necessary (If!! Often it really isn't needed at all.) and apply the basic principle of energy in/energy out. There really isn't a difference between men and women when it comes to how they lose weight. I can't keep repeating it, but determine calories. Eat less calories to lose weight, eat more calories to gain.

null,false,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"&gt; And unless your house is collapsing once every two years, owning a home is always going to be better than renting eternally.

So far since moving in in 2010, stuff I've had to do which a landlord would be responsible for and which have added £0 to the value of the house....

* Rear patio sliding doors needed replacing 6 months in as they warped so let the wind through (£900)

* Electric shower needed replacing (£250)

* Toilet needed repairing (£50)

* All 7 double glazed windows needed changing (£3,500)

* Boiler needed repairing twice (£300)

* Repair of small flat roof above one of the bedrooms and ceiling because the roof leaked (£500)

None of which came up in the survey.

In addition to this I've had to pay out in that 5 years £1000 buildings insurance (not home contents), £1250 life insurance for the mortgage, £150 for gas safety checks and after the boiler breakdowns, £1200 for boiler cover and gas safety checks.

Total outlay in 5 years: £9100. 

Difference between the repayment mortgage on a 75% LTV and renting my house, £100 a month. So to date I'm over £3000 worse off than renting. 

Jobs imminent in the next 1-2 years which need to be done, not want, need:

* Bathroom floor needs replacing as the laminate is starting to show signs of warping (£300 or so)

* New kitchen as all the cupboard carcasses are knackered from age. (£5000?)

&gt; Renting and a Mortgage are very close in terms of cost yet a mortgage leaves you with an asset whilst renting is a liability.

Owning your own home is a liability too. I own two houses. Why? Because when we needed to move we couldn't sell. Our only option was to release equity and end up renting out the first house so I now have an additional £65k of mortgage debt as a result. If I were renting I'd just hand in my notice, find somewhere else to rent and move.

And that house I've worked for all my life to pay for will be sold to pay for my care if I end up going into a care home.

null,false,LokoloMSE,null,null,null,"An ISA is just a tax wrapper. You can have the same investments (majority of the time) inside an ISA or outside; shares, funds etc. ISA just means you don't pay tax, but there is a limit on the amount you can pay into one in each tax year. 

Cash ISAs are paying quite low currently so it can be better to use current accounts (Santander 123, Lloyds etc.) and even after tax they pay more than Cash ISAs.

Investment ISAs can be opened with most brokers, some charge an additional fee for ISAs as there is more admin to deal with. Day trading on the market can be profitable, but it is EXTREMELY risky. It also costs a lot to trade, usually around £10 to buy then £10 to sell. So £20 in trading costs means if you bought £500 then your investments would need to raise by 4% before you even break even. Funds do not cost to buy with most brokers (sometimes there is an initial fee, some brokers charge trading costs), but these are collective investments run by fund managers. There is a nice fund filter here http://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/fundscreener/default.aspx?Site=uk&amp;LanguageId=en-GB where you can put in a few things (IMA Sector is the main one). Currently I put in £500 a month into a S&amp;S ISA into 3 different funds; 1 UK Equity, 1 Global Growth, 1x Bond. This gives me exposure to all investment areas.

That being the case, it's extremely probable that there were other monitored cases where they didn't collect sufficient evidence to prosecute, and further undocumented cases on unmonitored hunts.

The fact that we have a lower bound of 1 indicates it does happen. We can say with *absolute certainty* that it does happen, and statistically will happen regularly (if not frequently), across the nation's hundreds of hunting packs and thousands of rides/year.

I'm not pretending to put numbers on it because that's impossible, and accept that the error bars are large. That doesn't prevent you from inferring probable incidence from known data.

Given we have 1 successful prosecution, and the RSPCA are only getting a 20% hit rate, that indicates at least 5 incidents where prosecution was attempted (with 1 success), and if we knew what proportion of hunts were monitored, we could extrapolate the probable total number of crossed-scent hunts.

null,false,mathilda420,null,null,null,"I completely rehauled my skin care routine last week and now it's looking so much better. It was really congested and dull and I was getting spots which I never got when I was younger. I had amazing skin up until my mid twenties and it's gone down hill from there (though not with aging). I didn't know what to do or what was going on but I realised it was probably something to do with not being cleaned out properly! So I looked on Lisa Eldridge's website for advice and product recommendations when she basically described my skin when talking about her own in her favourite products video. So I bought a few things from that and that she mentioned on a blog entry talking about sensitive skin and I've noticed a huge difference in the last few days. Even my boyfriend  has noticed it's looking better because of my products and he's always tried to tell me that I use too much on my face and I'd be better with just water... (we have very similar skin and are exactly the same age but mines is in much better condition than his because I look after it so ner ner ner ner ner.) 
Anyway, the stuff I bought was:

Dermalogica age smart skin Resurfacing cleanser - more expensive than I would normally go for but my God so worth it. This is definitely the thing that has made the most difference. Anyone who can relate to my issues - just grit your teeth and shell out. So worth it.

---

Wileda wild rose smoothing day cream - I use this at night and it makes my skin look and feel so smoothed out and moisturiserd without being heavy or irritating. Nice price point too. Hasn't broken out my skin and it smells amazing. Also really like the packaging.

---

La Roche posay micellar cleansing water gel - I use this to take off my makeup at night before using the dermalogica. I really like this. It is very thorough and takes off all my makeup and spf very easily but doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Comes in a pump bottle which I really like. I use it like a face wash and take it off with a damp muslin cloth. Again. Nice price point.

---

Bioderma sensibo tolerence plus: I bought this because my skin isn't definitively sensitive but can be prone to redness and doesn't like mineral oil etc. I use this as a day cream before spf. It moisturises it nicely, doesn't clog it up or make it greasy and does seem to mitigate redness. Again, comes in a pump bottle which I really like and has a nice price point. I'm happy with it and will probably buy it again if I don't see anything that looks better. It apparently decreases skins sensitivity which I'm inclined to believe as I've had no issues using the dermalogica twice daily. (i was using a mild aha twice daily before so my skin did have some tolerence.)

So I guess I've discovered it is worth spending a liitle bit extra and also understanding your skin and not only what the problem is but why. And finding someone who has the same type of skin as you who can recommend products definitely does help. 

Hope this can help someone else. It's made such a difference to how I feel about myself. :-)

null,false,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;Sorry, but that is completely wrong

It's not wrong - you say we're the 11th,  but look at the countries above us and the amount of CO2 they're producing in comparison. The top 5 all produce at least double our CO2. China, who are top, are producing over 9 times our amount. Our whole production of CO2 accounts for about 1.5% of the world's production. Even if we wiped the UK off the map tomorrow, no significant global change would occur. 

&gt;per capita we're using around 8 tons per person. The IPCC estimates a global average of about 2 tons per capita[

The global average would include all developing countries, so it's not really relevant. It's a powerful stat only if it's not contextualised.

&gt;So we're miles from being anywhere near having respectable environmental credentials. We're not the worst, true, but that's hardly something to be proud of.

Indeed - and there are ways and means of improving things without crippling our economy. 

&gt;Moreover, the third runway locks us in to much higher air traffic for a long period of time. Path dependence is important when thinking about things like climate change. 

Are you honestly saying that we should never build an airport runway again then? That's ridiculously short-term thinking. 

&gt;As such it's a terrible idea, and shows the insane doublethink regarding climate change in the heart of both government and the population at large.

It's not at all. I'm all for green energy production and general improvements in industry in general, but supporting green policy on those doesn't mean I have to on everything. It's a balancing exercise.

If she can't, I would consider asking your parents to help you pay for one. Therapy, amongst other things, can help you learn to order your thoughts (rather than all of the horrible thoughts coming at once, overwhelming you). 

Starting yoga and meditation has also helped me dramatically. As has cutting down drinking (it helps short-term but seems to make things worse for me in the long run).

The body will use proteins for muscle repair and other things before it even remotely considers converting it to fat though. But yes, proteins for example would cost more energy to convert or process than fat.

However, when you look at the big picture, the differences between the foods would be extremely hard to keep track of, and how much you use to process your food really won't make the difference. In the real world it is simply impossible to look at how a certain person will convert food or how much energy it will cost that individual. Our bodies are unique, so you've got to be realistic about it. Calories in/calories out is (unless you're doing clinical tests and research and need it to be extremely precise) more than accurate enough to help someone maintain, gain, or lose weight. As long as the person is eating a deficit of 200 calories, they will lose weight regardless of what they are eating. If that person is eating 200 calories more than what they are supposed to, they will gain.

null,false,Willeth,null,null,null,"Hello! For the last two years, I have had no broadcast TV. If you want to go completely that way, the hardest thing you will have to convince them of is how the TV licence works. There is a lot of misinformation about it, but here's the headlines:

- You need a licence if you watch any TV as it is broadcast, through any medium, whether it's on the Internet or through an aerial, BBC or not.
- You do not need a licence if you watch via catch-up services, even iPlayer.
- You do not need a licence for radio, even when accessed through a TV set.
- You do not need a licence for simply owning equipment that can watch broadcast TV - it is the act of watching it that is licenced.

If they are happy to use catchup services for things through iPlayer, 4oD etc (although I think 4oD is called something else now), then they might be able to save that £150 per year if they aren't entitled to a free licence. If they want to be able to sit down and watch whatever's on, then of course that doesn't apply - but Freeview will be the best option as the only thing you'll be missing in that case is the specialist channels.

Currently, I've found that the best solution for me is via my games consoles and my Chromecast. I fire Chromecast up for anything UK based - iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube are all really easy to use with it. I also subscribe to Unblock Us, a proxy service, which gives me a custom DNS for my console, and allows me to access media (mainly Netflix) from other regions - it's a one time setup and easy to switch between them. Often, shows that are only available on, say Amazon Prime in the UK, are on Netflix elsewhere - for example, I watched Terminator 2 last night on German Netflix and watch the West Wing from the US selection. You can search those regions with flixsearch.io - the reason I do this on my console and not my Chromecast is because my current router doesn't support DNS changes.

I'd definitely recommend taking advantage of the free trials for Now TV and Prime Video etc - I've found the way they work pretty poor (Now TV removes content very quickly and the app doesn't work amazingly well, Prime has a smaller selection inclusive and the rest you pay extra for) but they may suit your parents well. 

Altogether I pay less than £10 a month for Netflix and Unblock Us, not counting internet access and without the £150 a year for the licence fee.",null,0,null,1436789190,null,0,1436789707,0,ct1mbsz,null,t3_3d48h0,null,t1_ct1mbsz,null,t3_3d48h0,null,null,null,1437816993,null,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13,null

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I think (and I say this with some experience) that the problem with the BMA's approach is they overstep their expertise when they make these suggestions. Doctors know **a lot** about the impact of sugar on health. They don't know anything about tax. Tax is not a subject that gets taught at medical school. So their solution to every modifiable disease seems to be to introduce some new punitive tax to disincentive the risk factors that contribute to it... but its a simplistic approach to say the least. It's easy for a group like the BMA to say ""Oh well, just tax sugary foods..."" but the implementation becomes very difficult.

Firstly, someone needs to establish at what point a tax on sugar foods becomes sufficiently punitive to actually be a disincentive. Adding 20% extra tax on a 70p bar of chocolate isn't going to be a disincentive in the same way that adding 20% tax on a £5 packet of cigarettes was for example. Next they have to consider how such a tax is going to effect the market. Sure we might have ideas about banning high sugar content foods like mars bars, but many foods the public mistakenly perceive to be healthy are infact high sugar - like strawberries, healthy ""smoothy"" drinks etc. Does one tax those to? How do you apply the tax to foodstuffs intended for the preparation of other food stuffs (i.e. cooking chocolate). Very soon the whole thing becomes unfathomably complicated. 

Really what the BMA need to do is move away from these smoking-style interventions that rely on heavy-taxation by government, towards simply making recommendations, i.e;

* ""The BMA recommends that people cut their sugar intake by 50%"".

Then simply draw the line there, before they start embarrassing themselves by mouthing off about tax - which is something they know nothing about.
 
If they're really keen they could draw to the governments attention relevant research in the field - for example summarizing evidence for different interventions which may range from posters in dental surgeries to more aggressive interventions like taxation. At no point should the BMA really be advocating a political solution to a health problem in this manner. That is for government to decide - not doctors.

What?

&gt;constipated

Shit is everything your body hasn't used. Being constipated does not lead to fat gain. You will indeed weigh more as you are carrying more waste, but once the bowels are flowing freely your weight will drop again and you'd still have roughly the same amount of fat either way; perhaps less since constipation tends to lead to a lessened appetite.

Fat is stored energy, unless you are capable of photosynthesis the vast majority of that energy (measure in calories) comes from food. If you are gaining fat it is because you have consumed more energy than your body has used i.e eaten to much. To lose weight you need to eat less than your body is using so that it utilises stored energy i.e fat. The actual mass of the food is irrelevant as some foods are more calorie dense than others. [Here](http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/goodfood/pages/what-does-100-calories-look-like.aspx) goes a good explanation, with pictures, of portion sizes.

We have much better cover at striker in Origi and Ings and look almost odds-on to sign Benteke who will hopefully be a great alternative to Sturridge when not fit or when we need a different option. Central midfield is arguably our deepest position (Milner, Can, Hendo, Lucas, Allen, I think we will see Coutinho playing deeper plus potentially players like Rossiter and Ojo coming through) and CB we have 5 players at least competing for 2 places, potentially 6 if Gomez and Illori are both in and around the first team. I think we are pretty much a striker (benteke) and a left back for cover away from a pretty solid squad. Signings we made last year will hopefully make more of an impact this season, this season's signings some will hopefully hit the ground running (looking at you Milner, Firmino), I don't see what's not to like about our transfer business so far, especially when you look at the amount spent to get these players in.",null,0,null,1436789889,null,0,false,0,ct1mjwt,null,t3_3d49vj,null,t1_ct1mjwt,null,t3_3d49vj,null,null,null,1437817170,null,20,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,20,null

Look at the Ottoman Empire and china, if you want similarly sized economic units (but of course India was a collection of independent states prior to the Raj - and even during the Raj).

Well, they have roughly 1 sixth of the worlds population living there, so they were always going to produce an outsize amount.  Per capita they're not quite as bad as us, and since a large proportion of their emissions go towards making goods consumed by other nations they're even less bad.  The ""we're only a drop in the ocean so shouldn't do anything"" line is total bullshit anyway, per captita we're above where we should be to avoid the worst of it, so we need to work to reduce our per capita emissions.  Some nations need to do more than us, some less.  Your line of reasoning just leads to a feedback loop wherby nobody does anything, and is thus completely unhelpful.

&gt;  The global average would include all developing countries

Well, yes, hence ""global"".

&gt;  there are ways and means of improving things without crippling our economy. 

Unlikely to the degree required.  Such is life, but it's better to have a smaller economy on a planet which is still in an optimal climate state for supporting our level of civilisation.

&gt;  That's ridiculously short-term thinking. 

Nope, long term thinking actually.  Between the need to reduce emissions, and the fact that oil prices are more likely to rise than fall over the coming decades, the airline industry is probably going to be hit pretty hard by fuel costs.  I don't really see a third runway being a good investment.

&gt;  It's a balancing exercise. 

No it's not, it's ignoring what the science says because you don't like the consequences.  A lot of economists, who don't have a clue about the role of energy in the economy, seem to think that we can decarbonise cheaply and easily.  However the opposite is likely true, and avoiding the worst is going to be expensive and require that we have a lower living standard.  Thing is, we'll have a much lower living standard if we keep on the current pathway.  Your response is classic loss aversion, which is a common cognitive bias in all humans and is to be expected really.

&gt; Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single option is sufficient by itself. Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at all scales and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link adaptation and mitigation with other societal objectives. {4}

&gt; Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. {4.1}

&gt; Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. {4.2}

&gt; Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. {4.3}

&gt; Effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales: international, regional, national and sub-national. Policies across all scales supporting technology development, diffusion and transfer, as well as finance for responses to climate change, can complement and enhance the effectiveness of policies that directly promote adaptation and mitigation. {4.4}

&gt; Climate change is a threat to sustainable development. **Nonetheless, there are many opportunities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses** (high confidence).

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"This does, in many respects, sound reasonable... particularly the part about drones being the direction we should be moving in - and infact the MoD recognizes that I believe. The problem is drone technology is moving really fast at the moment, and now isn't necessarily the best time to be investing heavily while we are still waiting to see which direction the technology moves in... especially since we don't really face much in the way of concrete threats right now, beyond a grumbling civil war in Syria and Iraq and can afford to wait a few years.

For example, if you look at the first drones which were bought on a large scale like the [General Atomics MQ-1 Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator) they are about to be replaced by a second generation of much more capable platforms which function more like traditional manned aircraft in terms of performance. The [BAE system Taranis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Taranis) and [Dassault nEUROn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_nEUROn) are a good example of this. In essence they aren't drones to augment a traditional force - they are drones to replace the traditional force. The idea is they are cheap, much more disposable, with performance closer to a fighter - and even with the capability to go head to head with a conventional manned fighter.

The expansion of special forces I'm not so sure about. It's certainly not a bad idea - but it must not be done at the expense of traditional land, air or sea forces. If our recent observations of the situation in Ukraine teach us anything, it's that a conventional war between two nation states is every bit as possible now as it was back in 1989.  Armour, mechanized infantry and rapidly deployable forces backed up by the logistics of a powerful navy and airforce should still be the backbone of our military. 

Ultimately, if you want to fuck around in Syria with ISIS you need more SAS... but if you want to pull your finger out and definitively crush ISIS, then you need armored infantry and the logistics to back them up 500km away from the nearest major UK bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar over a period of several years.

1. The Royal Family aren't the only ones born to luxury and aren't even the most luxurious family to exist. I find this argument rings hollow for as long as we allow other wealthy families to continue to exist. Arguing that ""having such a family as figureheads legitimises inequality"" is equally as hollow: our very society and economic system legitimises inequality. Having a Monarchy doesn't entrench that in the slightest and removing it would not combat it in the slightest either. What part of abolishing the Crown would bring down the salaries in the City or stop multi-million pound inheritances being passed down families all over the globe? It's simply an argument that sounds good as a soundbite but is utterly toothless in detail.

2. They generate a lot of revenue through two methods. First is the Crown Estate which, while not technically the Monarchs personal property, is not Government property. It's a semi-independent company whose exact position is murky due to our messy constitutional settlement. The ex-Monarch would certainly have a very strong case in court should he or she decide to sue for ownership, however, since it's only by agreement of that Monarch that the ""revenue for civil list"" agreement even exists. Yes, parts like ownership of all the swans would be removed, but the remaining company would control vast assets. Second is tourism: Europe is awash with palaces, mansions, chateux, and country houses, and none have even a fraction of the fame enjoyed by Buckingham Palace, and that rests squarely on the occupants of said palace. The figure of £500 million a year in tourism income has been proposed by Visit Britain.

3. The institution of the British Monarchy is a projector of soft power around the globe. It's a universally-known UK brand: say ""the Queen"" to anyone in the world and, unless they happen to live in a country with their own Queen, they'll think of the British one. Say ""the President"" and, with the same condition above, they'll think of Obama. 

I believe that converting to a Republic for the sake of blind ideology is a foolish sacrifice of a significantly useful national asset, thrown away in a trade that will gain us nothing. A President would do nothing different to the current Monarch without also altering the powers of Parliament, since our political system has grown up to not need a Head of State exercising any authority to function, but maintaining a sinecure President would incur costs for no gain: indeed from the above points I contend it would produce a loss.

In conclusion, while I have no loyalty to the Monarchy for woolly reasons such as national pride, divine mandate or thinking Lizzie is a stellar lady, I support keeping the Monarchy because it represents a profitable national asset.",null,0,null,1436791107,null,0,false,0,ct1mz31,null,t3_3d45px,null,t1_ct1mz31,null,t3_3d45px,null,null,null,1437817499,null,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

&gt;I have always said to my party that we cannot be too complacent. There is a lot to be done. We have come such a long way. We are going to go further together because it is right. No one, least of all me, ever thought that it would be easy getting from where we are to where we need to be.

&gt;I will say this to you, and I say it right from the bottom of my heart, when I have taken decisions in the Labour party that I believe are necessary to put this party in the position where it can win an election, it is not because I want to turn my back on the beliefs of the Labour party – in social justice, in ridding this country of poverty, in dealing with the stigma of homelessness – it is because I know that if we cannot get a Labour government then we can do nothing for the poor and the unemployed and the homeless.

&gt;Of course it is hard. Of course there is frustration building up [sic] this country. There is anger. There is outrage at what has happened. But outrage and anger are not enough. We have to be the means of translating that anger and that passion into the achievement of a change of government. I sit there in the House of Commons, I have ever since 1983, sitting there opposite me people doing things – the poll tax, the benefits cuts, the privatisation of decent public health services, what has happened in the health service, in our educations service – I have sat there and I have watched these people ruin our country, ruin it. I sit there opposite Michael Heseltine, Michael Howard, Virginia Bottomley, Peter Lilley, John Redwood…and those are the good ones! I have sat there and I have watched them.

&gt;In my own mind, I have complete confidence in the beliefs I hold dear. I know why I am in the Labour party, I know why I am part of it. I know why I have joined this party and worked for it for the last 20 years. It is because when you look around your society you see the injustice, you see the opportunity denied, you see the unfairness, you see all that elitism at the top, you see that establishment still there trying to run parts of our country, and you look around even beyond our country and you see a world which has plenty and yet is torn by starvation and war.

&gt;There are still great causes to unite decent people. There are still great fights and struggles to be won out there. But what has come home to me more than anything else is the utter futility of Opposition. I did not join the Labour party to join a party of protest. I joined it as a party of government and I will make sure that it is a party of government.

&gt;Do not let anyone ever forget that it is power for a purpose. It is power to put into place that programme for the long-term unemployed. It is power to give people a decent agenda of rights at [sic] the workplace. It is power to change our education system, to stop the privatisation of health, to build a better, more secure industrial future for this country. It is power for that purpose.

&gt;I tell you, look around at these Tories today they would not understand decency, respect and integrity if it came up and bit them in the leg. These are the people who have been running our country, and no longer should they be running our country, not in any decent society. Therefore, when I say to you, New Labour – and I do without apology and without hesitation – I do it because I know. That man there, Neil Kinnock [who was also on the platform that day], he struggled and in that brilliant way he brought this party back from where it was, practically dead, in 1983. Remember it. That is where we were. Do not ever forget, because he will not, every inch of the way: ‘you should not do it’, ‘it is going too far’, ‘it is the wrong thing’, ‘it is all being run by a tiny elite at the top’, all the rest of it. But we had to do it. We had to do it because of our concern for people who are poor and unemployed and homeless and at the injustice in our society. Then John Smith had to do it. I have to do it too. I do it because I believe. I do it because the society I want to create is not some fantasy or dream. It could be true. But it can only be true if we have the guts, the decency, the discipline and the honesty to tell it to those people out there like it is, not to make promises we cannot keep, to deliver on the promises we make, and to rebuild this country as a great nation again.

&gt;Yes, it is tough. Yes, it is tough, but, yes, we are going to do it. Those Tories who think they have a divine right to rule, not now, not today, not in this Labour party, not under this leader. New Labour. New Britain. Let us get on with it.

If you'd like to make one then I'll gladly change my mind.

Since rich and poor alike wear pinks alike I wonder how you can tell who was very wealthy and who wasn't. Sounds like you're just making that up to suit yor prejudices.

Yes, obviously. The people who *follow* the hunt do it for sport. No one who knows anything about hunting would pretend otherwise.

Yes, some foxes get torn to pieces. I haven't denied that.

Probably because you scare the huntsmen away from doing their job properly. I've seen video of sabs attacking huntsmen with an iron bar. Despicable stuff.

And yes, even the judiciary is getting sick of it. After one recent (successful!) prosecution, the judge remarked that he found it absolutely astonishing that the RSPCA found it appropriate to spend &gt;£100k on a prosecution where the maximum fine he was able to impose was £5k.

There have even been calls for their charitable status to be investigated given the overtly political nature of some of their lobbying and court activity.

In 2013, they were officially warned by the Charity Commission to review their prosecutions policy, and ensure they were spending their donor's money for the purposes it was donated for.
Over the past couple of years the RSPCA's income from donations has fallen by more than £7m/yr. Although their local staff and volunteers are very dedicated, their leadership have got grand ideas whilst forgetting the grass roots, and arguably the organisation has got too big, too broad and as a result many donors are disillusioned, moving their donations to smaller, more focussed organisations.

Despite what redditors will have you believe the UK has done very well post crisis. Especially when you consider how much of the UK's economy is based on finance. Productivity growth is an issue but this is a global issue and one I think is not restricted to the UK.

Osborne's  budget does a lot to help the majority of people. He's clearly committed to regenerating the North through his devolution powers. He's also going in the right direction on housing by relaxing planning regulations.

His 'living wage' idea is interesting. I'm not a huge proponent of it but it could work. I'd rather have cut the top income tax bracket to encourage more of the best talent globally to move here. The levels of tax here are one of the biggest issues the UK faces. This kind of ties into the next point.

The removal of non dom tax status is silly and pure symbolism. It won't raise any additional taxes and London will now have to compete on another basis. This is an un-known for now. It has the potential to be disastrous.

The UK is in pretty good shape and whilst I still feel you have huge issues that you are no where near solving, the NHS being the worst health service in the developed world for one, you still have the ace in the hole which is London. London is by far and away the worlds only truly international city and it will ensure you do well no matter what. That is unless the left gets it's way and they manage to destroy London. That's a real possibility if some of the redditors on here get their way.

For people doubting how important the London financial services sector there is should read these...

http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn06193.pdf

Also I get down voted on here so much that I have a ten minute timed response period so I have to pick responses carefully. This doesn't happen to me anywhere else so I guess that says more about the maturity of this sub than anything. Either way this means if you respond to me with drivel I'm not going to reply.

Edit. Oh and the 2% commitment to defence spending is very important. The UK was becoming embarassingly weak militarily.

We could have the worst ""top four"" squad in amongst our rivals, and still end up winning the league.

Of course, having a stronger squad makes it considerably easier to win matches, and special players make it even easier, but if a team is a team, rather than a collection of individuals then they will perform better.

Look at Dortmund over the last few years. Financially not even in the same league as the big boys in Germany, but they bought well and won the title two years in a row. Did they have the best squad? No. Did they probably even have the best team? No.

Erectile dysfunction may be a mental condition for many men, but a man without erectile dysfunction gets an erection as a reflex action due to basic stimulation.

The fact that erectile dysfunction exists and is primarily caused by mental issues does not mean that erections *in general* are a ""mental"" thing. They are a basic reflex, nothing more. 

I should also point out that plenty of men who suffer from erectile dysfunction do so for reasons that aren't mental.

Yes, there is a plethora of information out there as to how many calories are in food, most of the time it tells you on the packet so it is as simple as adding numbers together.

Unless their current intake is only slightly too much, more exercise is not going to be effective without a diet change. It is a simple concept really, if you are consuming more energy than your body uses (typically between 2-2500 without exercise) it will store the excess energy in the form of fat.

Huh? Many ways other than eating less calories? 

I don't dispute that people have various psychological reasons for over-eating, but unless they want to exercise self control and get through that or go to therapy then there is not much more can be done other than give nutritional advice.

&gt;the ways of getting to and maintaining that which are clearly less than simple, otherwise there wouldn't be as many fat people. 

I'm not sure what you are saying. How is it not simple to look at the amount of calories you are eating and make decisions based around that?

&gt;*""The United Kingdom ranks first overall, scoring highest on quality, access and efficiency,"" the fund's researchers conclude in their 30-page report. Their findings amount to a huge endorsement of the health service, especially as it spends the second-lowest amount on healthcare among the 11 – just £2,008 per head, less than half the £5,017 in the US. Only New Zealand, with £1,876, spent less.*

Stop drinking the koolaid and start expanding your reading. If you keep looking for things that confirm your beliefs then you won't see anything else.

The biggest issue is that the NHS could quite easily be one of the best in the world.

Christian Wolmar is running an AMA session here on Friday 17th July at 12:00! Feel free to start getting questions in in advance, or submit them on the day.

Please read the following rules before posting.

* All top level posts must be a question. All questions must be genuine and asked in good faith or will be removed.  
* Any posts which the mods consider aggressive, abusive or rude will be removed.  
* Any posts which are pointlessly party-political (""Labour sucks"" ""Tories suck"") will be removed.  

These rules are from the moderators and not from Christian, so if you think we're being heavy-handed please be mad with us, not him!

Please feel free to reply to this post (rather than make top level posts) if you'd like to make general comments about the AMA or post anything that isn't a question.



**EDIT:** Quick heads up, Christian warned me that he might be a few minutes late to start as he was filming this morning and had to make his way back across London before beginning. So just hang on in there!

**EDIT 2:** I'm afraid that's it for today, as per this comment that's all the time we have! Thanks for taking part all; I hope we can do this again!

I would like to know one thing, if I may: A man was kicked out of a political party in 2004 for fraudulent activity and was found to have subsequently defrauded the EU of half a million pounds as an independent.

And when someone (that would be myself) steps in to clarify that this had nothing whatsoever to do with Ukip, this is somehow evidence of being a ""fervent fanatic""?

Don't listen to that shite. People have been managing to maintain healthy body weight for millions of years without any knowledge of that stuff. Find something you are comfortable with and that you can manage long term, whether that's 1 2000 calorie meal a day, 2000 1 calorie meals or anything inbetween.

There are examples of people eating nothing but [McDonalds](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2575755/Getting-fit-fast-food-Man-lost-56lbs-eating-McDonalds-six-months-documents-experience-new-book.html) and other [junk](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/) and losing weight. It really comes down to how much calories you consume, not how you consume them. Of course extreme diets like these guys are going to cause long terms problems in terms of nutritional deficiencies, but as long as you have a good mix of vegetables, fruit and meat you will have a fairly nutritionally balanced diet.

&gt;All of these do have an impact on how one loses weight. 

I'm sure various eating patterns do have *some* effect, but they are not essential. They are more like tweeks. One might make you feel fuller more of the time, the other may make you lose weight slightly faster. It is more important to find something you are comfortable with, because as long as you can maintain the reduced food intake long term you will lose weight no matter how you go about it. Even if you relapse and binge one day, try slightly reducing your calories over the next 3 or 4 days to balance it out. It is more about averages over long periods than day to day intakes.

&gt;The psychological/neurological issues go beyond ""I feel sad therefore I eat."" This is, like most other addiction/compulsion issues, is a dopamine feedback loop. It isn't ""simple"" to fix them. 

I don't doubt that, but they are seperate to the physical reality of weight loss and the only way you are going to get through it is either therapy or your own willpower. 

&gt;Do you genuinely think your body consumes 2500 calories without exercise? I walk 10000 steps a day and My Fitness Pal definitely doesn't think so.

Yes, you should look it up. You must remember that even lying in bed your body has work to do such as maintaining temperature, pumping blood, processing food, filtering liquids etc even thinking consumes energy.

&gt;I'm intrigued that all of these people think obesity is so simple to solve, and yet there is a massive problem with it in society. 

We have an abundance of food, a lack of education and in my experience, most people are not good at exercising self control. Obesity is also a very long term problem and the slow nature of weight gain means a lot of people are blind to it before it is too late.

Here's what I think:

* People think the welfare system doesn't work
* We say, 'Yup, you're right, which is why we back these changes, but ultimately the Tories can't fix it. We can'.
* People start to trust us on this issue and vote for us
* We fix it so that it defends the people it needs to defend

Here's what you seem to think:

* People think the welfare system doesn't work
* But it does work! Stupid people!
* Unrelated complaint about the 'billionnaire class'
* We get elected for some reason

I'm sure Liz won't mind me speaking for her, here: You, me and Liz Kendall have something in common: We want a strong welfare system. Where we seem to disagree is on whether we want *this* system.

But let's think about this: You seem pretty left-wing. Do you want a system where some people (yes, a minority) end up stuck on welfare, unable to motivate themselves or get the qualifications they need to work? Do you want workfare to exist? Do you want evil work capability assessments? I suspect not. You want to change it. We all agree we need to change it: You, me, Liz, the Tories, the people. We just disagree about how.

So, we all want a different system. But then, for some reason, lots of people on the left have boxed themselves into defending *this* system *which they just agreed doesn't work*. And then when I point out that it doesn't work, people start yelling at me about second homes in Spain and the average person says 'What the *fuck* does this have to do with welfare? Why did I tune into *Question Time* to listen to this? I just want my son, who's on JSA, to be able to get a real job and for those [imaginary] spongers to not take the piss anymore, and instead I'm listening to this guy say ""stimulate consumer expenditure"".

You've also said if you were groped by a man it would affect you; well there are women that are groped by men frequently.

Imagine having bigger &amp; stronger people grope you on an relatively frequent basis. A difference in reaction between men &amp; women being groped isn't because women are more emotional, it's may be because being groped by a man is often much more intimidating, &amp; men generally don't face that.

The answer depends on what you value. Whether you want a seat at the table or to stand outside and watch the world change and move on anyway. Quite simple really; it's a lot like the arguments for/against Scottish independence, but on a bigger scale. 

I won't speculate as to whether or not it will pass as this is about as useful as speculating as to whether or not Greece will leave the EU etc. 

What's funny is that while there have of course been failed trade talks, what the EU winds up doing anyway is importing concepts from American commercial law, even if not entirely as a copy/paste, it's plain where the inspiration came from and why it was adopted. 

It just happens on like a ten year delay. Ecommerce regulation is a good example as are related rights in intellectual property. These delays are in large part also correlated with the EU's digital industry also lagging behind, but they're also evidence of the inefficiency of the EU project.

But we do not. The Tories long term economic plan is based upon massively increasing private debt levels.

In fact they encourage the increase in cost it takes to put a roof over your head.

Well that's patently not true--as you yourself point out--because we eat animals for food. I have at least two animals' lives ended for me every day. Moreover if you look at nature there are millions and millions and millions of animals hunted every day, often in ways far more barbaric than hounds killing a fox.

If we're concerned about the animal's welfare then the fact that hunting is also followed as a sport has nothing to do with it because the animal whose welfare you are so concerned about has no idea of the difference. But hunting isn't just a sport it also trims fox populations.

The issue here is that clearly a man who was capable of ripping off the taxpayer to the tune of half a million was able to rub shoulders with people in a party which portrays itself as so unlike the others. It is naive to think that the issue here is just to paint UKIP as thieves. Nobody sensible really believes that. The issue here is that yet again, another person with ties to UKIP has behaved deplorably or said something utterly offensive. All these examples, whilst individually somewhat explainable, form a pattern which suggest that UKIP *attracts* these sorts of people.

The big divide in understanding is the *why* of it all. There seem to be 3 camps, one of which is ""UKIP are evil scum"" which I won't dignify with a rebuttal.

The other 2 are:

1. UKIP are a political party and politics attracts scumbags. UKIP are like every other party.

2. UKIP are unlike other parties and stand for the every-man. This is therefore a result of bias and/or media conspiracy, as we can think of a good enough explanation for each snafu.

The latter I think is just not likely. The further problem is that many UKIP supporters are not very open minded when it comes to criticism of the party, so it becomes almost an impasse, with people such as yourself who insist on arguing a counterpoint to an argument that UKIP supporters suggest other people are implying.

And I say that genuinely with no disrespect. I applaud what UKIP have done in getting this country reconnected to politics and I don't see myself as any more correct or 'better' than yourself or anyone else here. I don't hold any allegiance to any party precisely because I want to avoid this unconscious bias, as well as the shit flinging that happens between camps.

However, back to my point, UKIP are a new party which has struck a chord with people who may not have had an interest in politics possibly for several generations. Whilst you might not be particularly fanatical, you have already picked a 'team' and spend your time arguing on the internet on their behalf which already makes you more fanatical than the average person, indeed even a kipper. Many of these newcomers to politics are similarly feeling engaged on a new level they have little experience in, and are still stuck in the my camp/your camp fallacy and so become fanatics. Again, I mean this with no disrespect, it is just an observation. It is no different to any other group or demographic.

Cabaye went to Newcastle from the then French champions Lille, when Newcastle had no chance going to the CL, players come to play in this league cause there are wages like no other team can offer unless it is one of the big boys of Spain, Bayern, PSG or one of those Russian teams funded by Gazprom.

Those diets are still going to have you eating less calories than you are burning otherwise you would not have lost weight.

&gt;I am not suggesting that people can't take control over it (although like all addictions, many will not, many will in fact die) to some extent. 

There is not much else that can be done. If they cannot control themselves and it kills them then, as grim as it is, they have no one to blame but themselves.

&gt;Also, like other addictions, the addictive and harmful substances can be restricted and controlled (they are currently actively pushed).

No doubt advertisement needs to be controlled.

&gt;Unlike other addictions, you can't give up eating.

And indeed unlike other addictions you only need to cut down on how much of the substance you are consuming rather than cut it out totally.

That is exactly my point. He *has no ties* to the party. It is analogous to saying an employee has ties to an organisation he was fired from.

I believe that it is *politics* that attracts these sorts of people. Ukip have a fantastic record of weeding out their undesirables, however this is portrayed as some sort of black mark against the party.

The main issue with acquiring a mortgage is the required downpayment. Not to mention any non essential repairs / upgrades can be postponed and saved up for.

I find it hard to argue the case that paying like £800+ a month for 30 years renting vs mortgage for renting coming out on top. Even if you are constantly moving around every few years, if you could manage to save up even one deposit you could just rent out the previous property as long as you can afford a downpayment.

Especially since eventually your mortgage will be paid off AND the price of your mortgage payments will technically decrease to inflation as the years go on.

Whereas rent is likely to increase with inflation every year or so.

That's a very blanket statement which is evidence of your mind being closed on the matter. A sign of fanaticism.

&gt; That is exactly my point. He has no ties to the party. It is analogous to saying an employee has ties to an organisation he was fired from.

He was accepted and hired in to the organisation in the first place. He is part of a *body* of evidence of people like himself joining the party. Do you deny that there is a lot of evidence of people who have been UKIP members behaving very poorly? I don't know a single person who knows anyone who has defrauded to the tune of anything, let alone half a million. Why so many in UKIP?

&gt; I believe that it is politics that attracts these sorts of people. Ukip have a fantastic record of weeding out their undesirables, however this is portrayed as some sort of black mark against the party.

UKIP have a strong record of kicking people out who make the bigger gaffes, but I don't see any real evidence of them strengthening their application criteria to prevent them entering in the first place. That suggests that they just don't want the bad press. That's standard politician behaviour.

&gt; I have an issue only with completely unfair, baseless attacks. Ukip has many ""work ons"", but not half as many as you would believe after reading a few posts on this particular sub.

As do all parties. Why do you refuse to address this? Why should UKIP not have their dirty laundry aired *just like every other party*? You are suffering from confirmation bias, because no party gets particularly favourable comments from any of the forums, except ironically enough UKIP.

I find this argument rings hollow for as long as we allow other wealthy families to continue to exist. Arguing that ""having such a family as figureheads legitimises inequality""

No, this is correct, they aren't the only ones born in to luxury, but this is not the point. Even though no legislative power is given to the Monarch, as an institution they are still part of our government and is a figure head of the country, which is why many, including myself, believe is creating a culture of inequality. Yes, you can argue there are wealthy people in the Commons, but they are often self made and 'democratically' elected, so people choose to place them in that position, where as the monarchy is given that position and money from taxes. Ultimately it promotes the idea that there are betters in society, solidifying the class system.

-
&gt;Europe is awash with palaces, mansions, chateux, and country houses, and none have even a fraction of the fame enjoyed by Buckingham Palace, and that rests squarely on the occupants of said palace. 
&gt;
It's a universally-known UK brand: say ""the Queen"" to anyone in the world and, unless they happen to live in a country with their own Queen, they'll think of the British one

I know others have replied stating that we can capitalise on more tourism by opening them up, so I'll offer a contrasting view point. I think the fame of our monarchy is mostly down to our history and ex.position on the world stage. Being a world super power would most certainly provide exposure to all of government. Where as the other major European supper powers have had their monarchies dissolved (and some returned) since the collapse of their empires, ours have remained; e.g. Germany, France, Netherlands and Spain. In addition, many of our former most successful colonies still hold our monarchy as their head of state (Australia, NZ, Canada etc), not to mention the worlds largest exporter of culture, the USA teaches that it gained independence from the British crown.

-
&gt;The figure of £500 million a year in tourism income has been proposed by Visit Britain.

I'm going to assume that this isn't the total tourism income for the UK - because it would be absurd to suggest that the Royal Family is
the only tourist attraction to the UK. Even so, despite the lack of sources/break down, £500 million is a relative figure. This figure does not take into account the spending required for the upkeep of the monarchy, how much is spent on security, abroad trips, luxuries, living expenses and the upkeep of all the Royal Households and Staff? Is the price of democracy really worth a skeptical £500 million (which isn't a lot in terms of macro economics).

&gt;I believe that converting to a Republic for the sake of blind ideology is a foolish sacrifice of a significantly useful national asset, thrown away in a trade that will gain us nothing. A President would do nothing different to the current Monarch without also altering the powers of Parliament, since our political system has grown up to not need a Head of State exercising any authority to function, but maintaining a sinecure President would incur costs for no gain: indeed from the above points I contend it would produce a loss.

Though I agree with your last point. I'll pose another point, the Westminster System is inherently broken, the matured system is too old and does not function well with modern British society. The beauty of reconstructing it all would provide us with the opportunity to create a system that works best for the country; we don't necessarily need a president. Even so, I can't imagine one president would cost more than an entire family.

This is incorrect.  Carbs have 4 calories per gram, fats have 9 calories per gram.

Everything has become about compromise. Compromise welfare, compromise tax cuts, compromise the NHS. The conservatives have become the 'sensible' intellectuals and we're becoming the party that tags along agreeing with everything they say but then tweaking it a little to slightly appeal to the left wing.

Your logic, from what I've gathered, is that threat of absolute poverty should be a motivator to get people into work. I don't agree with this, for several reasons. We're an advanced first world country, and should be able to take care of everyone. We have a billionaire class which is avoiding tax, which we need to chase **before** any sort of cuts are applied to our welfare system. No one should go homeless or living in absolute poverty just because they can't find a job. Most of my ideas stem from universal basic income concept.

You've also bought into the idea that most people on JSA are lazy teens who can't be arsed to get a job. That's a small minority. There are thousands of extremely qualified people who are being asked to work as retail assistants and understandably don't want to. This is why we need to stimulate spending in the working class, to encourage corporations to hire more skilled labour, taking these qualified people off the welfare system and into the contributing workforce. 

The majority of people don't have the attention span of a spoon, as you so eloquently illustrated with your 'average question time viewer monologue'. We need to say what needs to be said.

Firstly, just because I'm curious, could you link that source please?

Secondly, ""fear of being blamed"" does not equate to *being* blamed.

&gt;The stubbornly low conviction rates still put off 68 per cent of victims from going to the police

The problem here being, if we're to take that as 68 / 100 we first have to assume that all 100 were legally raped, which obviously isn't likely.

&gt;Do you really want to live in a world where 53% of victims are so scared of being blamed about their rape that they are ashamed to come forward?

Obviously not, but given that we don't live in a world where 53% (or anywhere near that percentage) of victims *will* be victim blamed, perhaps that's the fault of feminist movements who continually scream about ""MOST RAPE IS IGNORED BECAUSE VICTIM BLAMING"" and not the fault of the police or our wider society?

If the purpose of your organisation is to tell people who victimised and vulnerable they are in society, perhaps that's why they feel victimised and vulnerable in society?

&gt; Why am I not surprised? Probably because the majority of his colleagues are and have historically been thieving fucking parasitic bastards who do their very best to bleed the taxpayers dry and line their own and their families pockets with our money.
&gt; 
&gt; Any non-UKIP party member does something bad ""See, all politicians are corrupt!! That's why I voted UKIP!""
&gt; UKIP does something bad, ""Oh no, this title is misleading. [skirt around the fact the man was a UKIP politician and did steal from the taxpayers]""

You said the following:

&gt; I don't know a single person who knows anyone who has defrauded to the tune of anything, let alone half a million. Why so many in UKIP? 

How many members of Ukip have defrauded anyone on this scale exactly? The current count is one.

&gt; Do you deny that there is a lot of evidence of people who have been UKIP members behaving very poorly? 

I do not, and I am very glad they get the boot. The trouble is, if you are the only party that has a strong stance on immigration, of course you are going to attract people from the fringes. If the Conservatives and indeed Labour had contained immigration to sensible levels (ie pre 1997 levels) then Ukip wouldn't have attracted so many of these characters.

&gt; I don't see any real evidence of them strengthening their application criteria to prevent them entering in the first place.

How hard have you looked? Are you privy to the inner workings of Ukip's vetting process and any modifications that may have been made over the last few months?

&gt; As do all parties. Why do you refuse to address this? 

Probably because that is a completely different topic of conversation. This one is about unfair perceptions of Ukip.

&gt; you already are arguing on their behalf on a forum which doesn't actually matter.

And you are arguing an opposing point on the very same forum. You seem to think that due to not being affiliated in any way to a political party this gives you some sort of overarching, untaintable insight into all facets of this argument. Your own perspective is warped by your disillusionment with politics, and the belief that Ukip is no better than the other parties despite the fact that time and again they have acted honestly and swiftly in dealing with their undesirable members.",null,0,null,1436799834,null,0,false,0,ct1r409,null,t3_3d43m0,null,t1_ct1r409,null,t1_ct1qas2,null,null,null,1437819645,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

No-one is trying to convince anyone that men are more of a victim than women when it comes to abuse, neither is in anyway more a victim because every victim of the same crime is equal. Society on the whole is less likely to view f against m violence as strongly as m against f violence due to the general and scientific notion that men are generally larger and stronger than women. This in turn leads to a probable decrease in the amount of men reporting it. 

Please see the following correctly referenced link, that is written by a woman referencing studies done at universities, not only talking about the idea of violence but the rate at which it goes unreported in men and the reason why.

Graham-Kevan, N. (2011). The invisible domestic violence – against men | Nicola Graham-Kevan. [online] the Guardian. Available at: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/07/feminism-domestic-violence-men [Accessed 13 Jul. 2015].

It also talks about the idea that feminism itself and the powers and policies that the police have bought in because of it are also linked to the general and gradual rise in the amount of reported domestic violence against men.



So please please please post some form of concise argument that's not just saying ""oh my God everyone here is victim blaming so much and making out that assaults against women don't matter"" because no one at fucking all is saying that.

But I don't think this is something that should be exempt from the idea of Freedom of Expression. If they were playing the Billie Boys or the Famine Song or singing Do you want a Pastie Supper, I'd have a different opinion. I would say what they are doing is not protected under Article 10 and although making arrests there and then would endanger officers, the public and cause a massive riot, I'd  wait and make arrests when all the footage and intelligence is in. I'd also do as the cops have been recently and putting the photographs of any offenders on their social media pages and probably in the newspapers and their websites.

I will do everything in my power to continue to stop the hunts from taking place both at a political level and a sab level. Foxes do not need to be culled. Humans do. Humans don't own this planet, we share it with animals. We won't stop culling animals, chopping down forests, fracking the earth, sucking the planet dry of oil, pumping out greenhouse gases etc purely for the consumption of human greed for products we don't need yet dull us out while we wait to die. That's human nature. You clearly have never seen a hunt or been on a hunt as you believe that fox hunting is humane. To use your daft argument back at you, it's like an american general telling the president that drones are safe because they only kill terrorists and never harm civilians. I've seen the damage that fox hunting does. They do not need to be culled. Foxes being shot at would be far more humane IF they did need to be culled. 
  Millions of animals are hunted every day often in far more barbaric ways than hounds killing a fox? Yes in nature it's done for the purpose of food. That can't be stopped. Animals don't hunt for pride or for a trophy. Just humans.   Humans are the only species that kill in such cruel and unnecessary ways for pleasure or greed. Look at bull fighting or ivory poachers or that festival in China where they torture dogs. 

Animals being killed for food, for the most part is done far more humanely. Cows, chickens and pigs are not chased for miles across a country side frightened for their lives. That's the difference. You are unable to see that.  

Pointless carrying this on.

Or perhaps this might have something to do with the fact the anti-war pacifists (im glaring at the Obama administration in the USA) pulled out of Iraq before Bush's rebuilding plan was initiated. The surge of troops virtually halted insurgency activity, and in his 2008 State of the Union Address Bush outlined the 1.2$ billion plan for an Iraqi Marshall Plan. I also want to remind everyone 62% of Iraqis wanted Western troops to stay. 

The plan was never implemented of course, Obama withdrew rapidly, Iraq descended into chaos, we were seen as invaders because we never properly created the infrastructure for democracy to flourish. Rather than ISIS being the fault of the war, I think its the fault of the anti-war mindset we adopted midway into the conflict. Iraq very well could've been a stable Western ally by now if we'd seen the whole thing through, rather than caved into political popularity contests.

As for Afghanistan, things aren't half as bad there, the ANA is actually defeating the Taliban relatively independently, and the country has held two democratic elections, one without any disturbances at all.

You seem to be switched off to the benefits that pensions can offer over ISA's, they offer a number of tax free advantages that ISA's do not, I believe utilising both is essential to maximising your efficiency and reducing your tax bill.

Also make sure you are always utilising an employee match on a pension that will become mandatory for all employers as of 2017, I get a 3/5 contribution split, so I contribute 3% of my salary and get 5% extra from my employer, this is like getting an interest rate of 150% the moment you invest, you can put your pensions in different places and it depends where your company offers, but even if your options are sub standard, the initial addition of 150% makes it worthwhile always.

I would also recommend that you write all this shit down, its way to complicated to understand all the numbers in your head, I designed a spreadsheet that predicted how much I plan to earn throughout my career and then a prediction of my living expenses along with an estimated rate of return. this allows me to budget and predict where my finances will be down the line. 
For note, the numbers don't need to be super accurate, just be reasonable and somewhat conservative, it will help you to visualise and understand the numbers behind it, and once you have a working mathematical path to FI, it makes the decisions needed to get there much simpler.

What many of us at UKIP have a problem with is the sheer prejudice and unfair coverage we get.

&gt;*Any non-UKIP party member does something bad ""See, all politicians are corrupt!! That's why I voted UKIP!""*

We expel and make an active effort to keep such people out. Still acknowledging their existence. The moment it's discovered the corrupt or unwanted are kicked and we are *still* blamed for it. Whereas, in mainstream politics, bad talk is shoved under the rug and corruption, in general, is just sealed away.

An example of our efforts, in its most primitive form, is that we don't employ ex or current BNP affiliates as a part of our constitution. The reds and blues have had them weaved in their ranks.

&gt;***UKIP does something bad, ""Oh no, this title is misleading.** [skirt around the fact the man was a UKIP politician and did steal from the taxpayers]""*

They often do. I believe we call them spin doctors. Press which often engages in contextomy etc. Take this article for example:

&gt;*Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote convicted of fraudulently claiming £500,000 in expenses*

He didn't run as a MEP for UKIP. He was expelled before running. He was a former UKIP candidate. The title suggests that this happened under UKIP's watch (I won't go into semantics). Whereas, however, he was kicked out of the party in 2004 for an offence. He was, to note, convicted on 12 accounts of fraud, **as an independent,** between 2004 and 2010. They made UKIP a focus leading to false representation.

&gt;*UKIP does something bad, ""Oh no, this title is misleading. **[~~skirt around the fact the man was a UKIP politician~~ and did steal from the taxpayers]""***

The man was a former UKIP candidate who hadn't run as an MEP under UKIP. You've fallen to word play. It's called propaganda. He stole from the taxpayers as an independent. I don't understand why people blame UKIP for expelling someone on the first sign of abuse. They have done what they could. What else can you ask for?

You're blaming UKIP for the actions of an individual which they weren't even housing.

Your prejudice towards UKIP's apparent. I won't call you a bigot because I'll hope you're not. I'll hope you're open to reason and compromise.

And, yes, where we can steal popular Tory policies and fit them into our narrative and our values, I say we steal them.

&gt;Your logic, from what I've gathered, is that threat of absolute poverty should be a motivator to get people into work

I don't know how you gathered that. I said 'I want a strong welfare system that supports people who need it' (or something to that effect). Did you read the whole of my response?

In the rest of that paragraph you, again, start talking about billionnaires. I don't disagree with you, I just don't think it needs to be brought up in a debate about welfare. The public don't want us to do X, Y and Z, then tackle welfare. They want us to tackle welfare.

&gt;You've also bought into the idea that most people on JSA are lazy teens who can't be arsed to get a job. That's a small minority.

I'm not going to check, but I'm fairly sure the words 'a small minority' appeared in my post above in reference to this exact thing. Again, you may want to re-read what I actually said. I certainly don't believe that many people on JSA are lazy or that all of them are teens, and in the case of the ones that are either or both, I don't believe that's why they can't get a job.

&gt;The majority of people don't have the attention span of a spoon, as you so eloquently illustrated with your 'average question time viewer monologue'. We need to say what needs to be said. Labour needs to bring the solution to the forefront of the debate, not succumb to the ""harsh truths"" mantra the Tories keep forcing down our throats.

When we say 'I'm going to fix the welfare system by tackling this other thing' or 'Don't worry about welfare, I'm going to sort out this other thing that you don't think is a problem and then I won't have to deal with the thing that you just told me you thought was a problem' people won't listen to us. It's not about attention span; it's not about 'hard truths': It's about not changing the subject.

Schneiderlin should be a good signing, he's young yet well experienced in the Prem and has proven himself as a solid defensive mid. He is the obvious low risk signing for them. The only way he would fail is if he struggled to cope with a high transfer fee or the expectations of a bigger club but that could be said of anybody.

Darmian I rate quite highly though it wouldn't surprise me to see him struggle to adapt to the Prem and be judged a bad buy. Hopefully he has a poor first year and they ship him back to Italy for a loss.

Depay will probably do well over time but he's just a kid and who knows how his career will progress. You would think a veteran ex Dutch International manager would be able to get the best out of him but we'll see.

Schweinsteiger has missed a big amount of games in 3 of the last 4 seasons and is very much on the decline.

I buy, repair and sell bikes as a hobby/way of making myself some extra cash. There's a Facebook page called 'bike seller Liverpool' or something along the lines of that (it changes every now and then). 

One of the guys who runs it/posts on there got me in a lot of trouble a few months back, as I unknowingly bought a stolen bike and tried to sell it on - house search, arrested for 'handling stolen goods' and 3 months on bail without my phone or laptop. 

Anyway, they're constantly posting bikes which I'm pretty sure are mostly stolen/dodgy in some way, so keep an eye on that. Preloved, pinkbike and bargain Bay on Facebook are also sites to keep on top of. I'll keep a look out for it too...

If you haven't got a multimeter, you can pick up a dedicated tool for the purpose, something like this: http://www.sealey.co.uk/pdfs/instructions/PPVT.pdf

For any given point in the wiring, the PPVT-style tools will tell you if it is connected to ground, connected to 12v or floating free.

I don't know what the layout of a GN125 is but, if its anything like my XL125, you'll probably have to remove an obscene amount of the bike to get to the wiring boot (aka where all the connectors are)

Start by checking that one side of the bulb is connected to -ve on the battery, then that one side of the fuse gets +12v on the battery, then work your way towards the middle from there.

Looking at the [wiring diagram](http://cmelectronica.com.ar/wiring-diagram/imagenes/suzuki-gn125-h.jpg) the +12v line (red) goes from the main fuse to the ignition key switch, then the sidelights (brown) line goes from there to both the front and rear lights (""posic"").

My money would be on something wrong with the ignition switch itself, or the ignition switch connector.

If Greece was to leave the Euro it could benefit the rest of the Eurozone and they could rejoin if circumstances where better.

I also think that is wrong for politicians in the UK to rule out future membership of the Eurozone as the crisis in Greece is not about the euro being unworkable and there are advantages in joining. 

Greece's economy was mismanaged for years and was made much worse by the banks. They became overconfident with themselves, cheep credit was everywhere. The global economy was put out of balance. This lead to the economic crisis which started in 2008. 

While there has been reforms the current policies do very little what Greece needs to do is to default while remaining in the Eurozone. After that they need to ease interest rates so it can pay off the debt in it's own time.

Currency devaluation would just make things much worse because this doesn't lead to competitiveness quite the opposite is shown to true.

Schneiderlin is a good signing, will slot in to replace Carrick when he hangs up his boots in the next year or 2.

I just named three teams in the CL, that also will offer astronomical wages, and will most likely offer more than us (City,United,Chelsea, Arsenal who knows with that wage structure) in terms of wages. They could all also offer more cash upfront than us if they wanted as well, so......

Also, wages are only way way higher in England if youre not a top talent, but players the likes of Lacazette that are targets of teams like Bayern,Madrid, Barca etc, are all going to get paid in the top brackets, I mean you think Bale took a paycut going to RM? His is top class and will be paid accordingly.

I just don't understand why you think know better than the general consensus around, well, fucking everywhere. You *really* think Ayre just is ignoring this totally in favor of Benteke? Why do you think that, what have you read/heard that indicates we would rather have Benteke than Lacazette? My bet is the fact that weve only been linked to Benteke constantly this summer and never Lacazette. 

Well the reason we are not linked with him is that he is not really linked with any team as he does not want to leave from what my brothers say is in the local papers and on the radio in France. He wants to maintain CL, his form and his health leading up to the Euro's in France this upcoming  summer, and  he is said to want to leave after the EC next year. Take that with a grain of salt but its what my brother has been hearing all year over there, and it holds some water. 

While you are right about Aulas 100% taking a fee he considers to be an overvaluation, why would he cash his hand in so early on one of if not THE hottest young striker on the planet? 

You act like Ayre just is not interested and seem to be thinking that getting Lacazette is just a matter or Ayre ringing up Aulas and going ""25m for your best player', both of which are equally absurd.

The moment it's discovered the corrupt or unwanted are kicked and we are still blamed for it. Whereas, in mainstream politics, bad talk is shoved under the rug and corruption, in general, is just sealed away.

Do you not wonder why you have such a fair share. And why they keep saying racist things? Even Nigel Farage's Romanian comments.

You've got the support of the likes of Nick Griffin. UKIP's bedfellows are some really scary people. The Italian, Northern League, True Finns, Danish People's party, etc. Let's not forget Polish MEP Robert Iwaszkiewicz either. Do you not seriously question the ethics of your party?

&gt; The man was a former UKIP candidate who hadn't run as an MEP under UKIP. You've fallen to word play. It's called propaganda. He stole from the taxpayers as an independent. I don't understand why people blame UKIP for expelling someone on the first sign of abuse. They have done what they could. What else can you ask for?

Then for that I will concede. But I still stand by original words that UKIP members would be citing this as a corruption and how UKIP are different.

I do have bad views of UKIP. Because I think it's a spoiled party. Whether or not their immigration views are correct doesn't matter at this point because even if I felt we need to close our borders, I wouldn't want them in charge.

UKIPs party is made up of a lot of racists. It attracts racists. It has a lot of racist party members. Hate like that is all consuming. I truly believe they'd harm the country before they'd help it, if it meant getting rid of people of other races and religions. See the EU non-votes for example.

&gt; They often do. I believe we call them spin doctors. Press which often engages in contextomy etc. Take this article for example:

Spin doctoring is Farage's speciality. 
It's usually a problem once people find out about their behaviours. You can be a closet racist, you can lead your party with racist viewpoints and let it guide you, but you can't ""say"" you're racist. This is UKIPs way of getting the 50-somethings who don't ""think"" they're racist, but do and say racist things.

That is why people vote conservative, because the service don't effect them, they pay for them in taxes but they don't use them, so the better solution is to vote for someone who is going to reduce rather than increase them. 

The problem they fail to acknowledge is if everything goes to hell the safety net is weaker, but they just ignore it, and if they ever need it, due to losing there job, due to health problems, due to some form of accident, it is too late, they are now lower class, but as long as the Conservative government can convince people they are better off with them, right here and now, not in 10 years or 20, they will get there votes, because people don't think or care about their own future on that time scale let alone the countries, most people are just after an extra £20 in their pocket at the end of the month, irrelevant of the unseen cost to whatever service has occurred, that is completely forgetting that the visible £20 in their pocket has most likely just been taken away at some later date in some form of stealth tax, as the Conservatives don't actually cut taxes as a party, but as long as people believe their propaganda they can say it all they like, it is not surprise that the Conservative government put VAT up from 17.5% to 20% and will never put it down again, the key to the scam was putting it down to 15% for a few months as an economic stimulus, which as we can all see really perked the economy up, oh wait no that didn't happen, it is the long game here, you don't feel screwed if you don't remember what it was like.

People seem happy to accept what they are being fed. Believe it or not, players leave CL clubs to play with clubs outside the CL, if it means they are going to play at a higher level of football. 

I don't know if you were following football back in 2011, that seems like an age to you, since you probably started watching the game like yesterday but Cabaye was the best midfielder in Ligue 1 that year, won the league with Lille. Where did he go to? United, surely Arsene would sign the best French midfielder in Ligue 1, no, he went to Newcastle, yes, that team who finished 12th the year before, has Fat Mike as their owner and wear barcode like t-shirts as their kit.

That same year, Atletico, sold their best striker to Man City. They had finished 7th in Spain, barely making the EL. Surely they replaced Aguero with a random striker from Betis or Mallorca, right? No, they went and bought Falcao, the same guy who was top scorer for Porto that year, the team who won the Portuguese league, cup and the Europa League and was guaranteed to play in the CL the following season.

Want more, we bought Meireles from Porto, a Portuguese international, playing with Porto with the Owl as our manager and  the cancers as our owners, unbelievable right?

What about Bacca who just won back to back ELs with Sevilla and was on his way to playing in the CL, did he go to a CL team, nope? He went to Milan, the same fucking Milan who finished last season in 10th.

I also mentioned that no player has ever been sold from Ligue 1 with a price as high as the one Villa want for Benteke, a point which you keep on missing for some reason. He will also take considerably lesser wages since it is going to be his first move outside of France.

You might also not want to hear this, but Benteke is a Rodgers' buy, and there is a reason why he wants a target man, cause that was his blueprint at Swansea, the same blueprint he has been trying to replicate with no success. Here is an article dated back to 2012, go read it especially Zone 7

I've had the same thought. Especially at the price of €20m. That doesn't mean much considering it's Utd, but it still seems like a lot of money to pay for someone you probably won't get *that* many games out of when all is said and done.

You can also get Netflix and IPlayer apps for it as well as Channel 5 on demand. ITV don't officially have an app but the Scottish ITV STV does, it asks your postcode on first startup, Google a scottish one, put that in and you'll get all the ITV programmes.

Fire stick is simpler to use than chromecast as it has a remote with it so you don't need a smartphone. Amazons tech support are also very good. And if you need to return it they have the simplest consumer friendly return policy of any online retailer. You'll have your replacement the next day and then have a month to return the faulty one and they'll give you a label to print off and either send a courier to collect it or get you to drop it off at a corner shop.

Internet wise BT are rolling out fibre right now, an unlimited 70 Mb connection is £26 a month (which is about the same price as the 16Mb non fibre offering), there is also a 35 Mb service which is slightly cheaper) plus £16 a month line rental which they are already paying if they have a landline. On the BT website they can put in their postcode to see what services are available in their area.

Other companies offer broadband but they all use BTs infrastructure and alot of them aren't truely unlimited and throttle during peak time or if you use too much which is a huge issue when you're streaming alot of video 

In bigger cities Virgin media are available and offer better adveetised fibre speeds than BT, but I've found their service and actual speeds (especially during peak times) to be very poor, your mileage may vary and 35 Mb is more than enough for streaming one thing at a time.

If they want more choice with Netflix then they can use a service like Uno telly DNS (on my phone so don't have URL to hand, but Google them) it allows you to switch between any Netflix region (which all have different content) and their website has fairly easy to follow tutorials for setting it up on all sorts of devices, they offer a free trial as well",null,0,null,1436802317,null,0,1436808480,0,ct1sl90,null,t3_3d48h0,null,t1_ct1sl90,null,t3_3d48h0,null,null,null,1437820317,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

This is the problem, right here. *This is compromise.*

&gt; And, yes, where we can steal popular Tory policies and fit them into our narrative and our values, I say we steal them.

All the while alienating our entire left wing and sending them to the Green party/Lib Dems etc. We made this mistake last election, are we really going to make the same mistake again? *sigh*

&gt; I don't know how you gathered that

Well you are supporting the cuts, living on benefits is hard enough as it is, it's going to get a hell of a lot tougher with the new reforms. Not to mention the disability cuts but thats a whole different issue.

&gt; In the rest of that paragraph you, again, start talking about billionnaires. I don't disagree with you, I just don't think it needs to be brought up in a debate about welfare. The public don't want us to do X, Y and Z, then tackle welfare. They want us to tackle welfare.

This is the attention span issue I was talking about. Economics isn't just ""X is broken lets do Y to fix it."" This is exactly whats wrong with politics, it's become a soundbite fest where everyone squanders over what policy *sounds* the best without actually creating a policy that works.

Here's a better way to present it to the public. ""Our finances are broken, we need a better system to be able to pay for our welfare state, therefore we need to do X Y and Z to pay for welfare."" You, Liz and Harman taking the dangerous and reckless shortcut of just saying ""Welfare is broken, lets cut it to fix it"", which will leave countless people in desperate poverty and damage the core values of the Labour party.

&gt; It's not about attention span; it's not about 'hard truths': It's about not changing the subject.

It's not changing the subject, its economics. We can't pay for welfare, we need to make more money, we need to change certain policies to cut down on people maliciously avoiding tax that should be paying for our most vulnerable. If you're answering an essay question or writing a book, you will have different sections/chapters that all build up to your final conclusion. The different sections and chapters aren't 'changing the subject', there's presenting foundations for your final conclusion.

&gt; 'Don't worry about welfare, I'm going to sort out this other thing that you don't think is a problem and then I won't have to deal with the thing that you just told me you thought was a problem'

What on Earth is this... I hope that our education system is enough so that people can reason together this simple argument:

""There is not enough money to pay for our essential welfare system, we must generate money from elsewhere, we are starting with going after the billionaire tax evaders that aren't paying their way and contributing to our struggling finances""

Sounds like you believe in equality of outcome: 

&gt; It [equality of outcome] describes a state in which people have approximately the same material wealth or in which the general economic conditions of their lives are similar. Achieving equal results generally entails reducing or eliminating material inequalities between individuals or households in a society, and usually involves a transfer of income or wealth from wealthier to poorer individuals, or adopting other measures to promote equality of condition. [From the wiki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_of_outcome)

Equality of opportunity is about *treating* everyone the same, while equality of outcome is about *giving* everyone the same.

null,false,pasigster,null,null,null,"first i think you need to answer one fundamental question:
why do you want the house?


there are many reasons why someone wants their own property. Is it because you want to settle down? or as an investment option (sell with profit eventually)? you plan on getting children and want to be able to do whatever you want with the house (paint, change etc) or maybe just to have something to own and one day pass on to your children? there are many different reasons to buy a house with different options attached to them..


If you feel like you want to be ahead of the game and catch the market on the upwards trend and later sell the property for big profits, (prices are always rising they say in london, they can only go UP!) then IMO dont buy. real estate is not a good investment option in any way (in any country), there are other methods to make more money with more flexibility and less risk. (i know brits love to buy so this comment might get downvoted... in other european countries the people are not buying crazy like the brits.. in london i believe the market is hyped up and very much inflated, making it a very risky investment. 


even if the reason for buying is not for profit but for simply having your own little nest to keep for a long time - you are anyways very young, staying flexible is a luxury with your age especialy in the current economy. jobs are no longer just around the corner, you can apply in other cities and other countries and dont want to be locked down. Sure you can buy and then rent out and then move to another city, then the property ""practically pays for itself"" as everyone says - not really... you have to include transaction fees, agency fees, the hassle of looking for tentants (in a very competetive and fluctuating environment) you will need to invest money for repairs to keep it up etc. and hope the market stays its course. buy to lease is also not an easy sure investment option as everyone thinks.


i say: hold the course, save what you can (shares ISA) and try to invest in yourself (at your age the best investment for long term profit as this should result in higher salary) with classes, certificates, degrees or whatever. revisit your idea of purchasing in 10/15 years years, see where you are, who you are with etc. By that time you will have a decent chunk if savings (more money down = better mortgage possibilities and less costs) and a higher salary to work with..


dont just hop on the train of owning property because society tells you to do it and friends do it and you want to belong there aswell. renting is nice, flexible, low risk. if you dont like you place or neighborhood, change to the next. if you find a job in another city, get over there... stay easy, BUT (!) when doing this it is important to save what you can and invest it wisely..

Well, many things here. One, we shouldn't be trying to find citations that support our own ideas, that's a terrible way to research things. Two, *I've not argued for or against a position*. I'm not arguing with you, I was just calling you out for complaining about research without bothering to read it, then not bothering to even look up the citations.

As a *repeated* my comment just said that you should attack the actual report and the actual data, not whatever you imagined it would be. This is despite the fact that it's incredibly easy to get access to this information.

&gt; I've read 2 of the 3 citations, both of which clearly state that they didn't produce enough evidence to justify a policy.

Do you disagree with the conclusions of the papers then?

---
&gt; This review indicates that food taxes and subsidies can influence consumption in high-income countries and that imposing substantial taxes on fattening foods may improve health outcomes such as body weight and chronic disease risk. The findings support current recommendations that taxes and subsidies should be included as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent obesity.

---

&gt; Health related food taxes could improve health. Existing evidence suggests that taxes are likely to shift consumption in the desired direction, although policy makers need to be wary of changes in other important nutrients. However, the tax would need to be at least 20% to have a significant effect on population health.

---

&gt; To have a measurable effect on consumption, taxes need to be tied to consumption, and they need to be larger than the existing state variation in sales taxes.",null,0,null,1436803862,null,0,false,0,ct1tk9a,null,t3_3d2ioq,null,t1_ct1tk9a,null,t1_ct1sze1,null,null,null,1440482603,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;All the while alienating our entire left wing and sending them to the Green party/Lib Dems etc. We made this mistake last election, are we really going to make the same mistake again? sigh

The majority of people in the UK voted for a right wing party at the last election. We didn't really lose any votes to the Lib Dems. You're also making a common fallacy, which is that we could simply get a more votes if we moved left a little bit. However, if we did this, we would also lose votes to the right. You know, like we did in the last election.

&gt;Well you are supporting the cuts, living on benefits is hard enough as it is, it's going to get a hell of a lot tougher with the new reforms

You seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that we can stop these cuts today. We can't. Opposing or supporting them now makes absolutely no difference to whether or not they happen. What we can do is try and get elected in five years, at which point, we will be able to make a difference.

&gt;This is exactly whats wrong with politics, it's become a soundbite fest where everyone squanders over what policy sounds the best without actually creating a policy that works.

Please, give me an economics lecture that changes all that forever.

&gt;Here's a better way to present it to the public. ""Our finances are broken, we need a better system to be able to pay for our welfare state, therefore we need to do X Y and Z to pay for welfare."" 

The public do not want to pay for welfare. Any sentence ending 'to pay for welfare' will fall on deaf ears, especially if it's proceeded, in any way, by the words 'tax' and 'more'.

&gt;It's not changing the subject, its economics.

It is changing the subject. David Cameron doesn't hand people a book he wrote when they ask him about welfare. He doesn't dispute the premise. He doesn't start talking about something else. He just answers the fucking question.

&gt;""There is not enough money to pay for our essential welfare system, we must generate money from elsewhere, we are starting with going after the billionaire tax evaders that aren't paying their way and contributing to our struggling finances""

It also suppresses the feeling of satiety caused by eating and suppresses the feeling of energy and desire to exercise.

Will power is easy to talk about but much harder to exercise. As I explained elsewhere, there are powerful reactions happening in your brain when you indulge in addictive behaviour. 

Its like asking a junkie to just stop using. Some people can, many can't. Also, once a Junkie has stopped, avoiding smack is much easier than avoiding food. Even with alcohol, users are advised to stop totally rather than having the odd drink or, to make a better parallel, have a moderate amount of booze on a daily basis. 

Take my problem for example. I love to eat and cook. i am fascinated by and knowledgeable about food. 4 days out of 7, I exercise, I eat well and look after myself. But I am capable of eating such a huge amount on the other 3 days that it is easy for me to sidetrack myself. A lot of people have that exact behaviour with Alcohol...

I don't really read blogs. I do think that abusing people with debilitating problems is shitty.

Maybe because all the clubs that you mentioned are interested, are not?

Same reason why Suarez was at Ajax and our only competition to sign him was Spurs.

Lacazette is not ready for a jump to Madrid, Barca, Bayern, etc. but he is a fine fit for a club in our size, Spurs, Roma, Sevilla, Valencia, etc. You will be stunned when you see that Lacazette's next move is not to a one of those ""top"" teams you keep harping upon.

We haven't moved for Lacazette, because we are not interested. Because Rodgers wants a target man, not because of the competition facing us, cause there is no one who wants to take a risk on signing him now. Maybe someone will take a risk later on in the window when options begin to dry up, but so far, if we come in, offer him 30 million pound, he's ours before you say ""Please explain""",null,0,null,1436804838,null,0,false,0,ct1u6o2,null,t3_3d40es,null,t1_ct1u6o2,null,t1_ct1tu20,null,null,null,1437821186,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,false,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;Ah, the old ""appeal to China"". Well, they have roughly 1 sixth of the worlds population living there, so they were always going to produce an outsize amount. Per capita they're not quite as bad as us, and since a large proportion of their emissions go towards making goods consumed by other nations they're even less bad. The ""we're only a drop in the ocean so shouldn't do anything"" line is total bullshit anyway, per captita we're above where we should be to avoid the worst of it, so we need to work to reduce our per capita emissions.

And we are.

&gt; Some nations need to do more than us, some less.

Which is massive problem seeing as the ones that are doing less are some of the biggest producers.

&gt;Your line of reasoning just leads to a feedback loop wherby nobody does anything, and is thus completely unhelpful.

Well, that's not true is it, because I'd say my view is fairly consistent with most governments, and we **are** reducing CO2 emissions. 

&gt;Unlikely to the degree required. Such is life, but it's better to have a smaller economy on a planet which is still in an optimal climate state for supporting our level of civilisation.

I would suggest that the scenario you're presenting is a little exaggerated.

&gt;Nope, long term thinking actually. Between the need to reduce emissions, and the fact that oil prices are more likely to rise than fall over the coming decades, the airline industry is probably going to be hit pretty hard by fuel costs. I don't really see a third runway being a good investment.

That's a different argument. And I suspect the government will know best on that one. 

&gt;No it's not, it's ignoring what the science says because you don't like the consequences.

No it isn't - I know about what the science is, and your version of what will take place goes in to the territory of doom mongering. And even if it didn't, the construction of a third runway would neither here nor there in your scenario - the world would be fucked anyway. 

I'm not arguing against climate change, it's just your argument is over the top for this discussion - the sum total of all plane pollution is only around 2% across the whole world. If we're going to solve global warming, we need to look at things we can easily change like power generation, not at things that can't be replaced.

Interestingly, Nuclear, which would be one of the most green power solutions, and which would seriously cut CO2, has never been accepted by the green lobby.

Why does this country seem constant in shooting itself when it comes to production and moving forward as a society? This will only benefit in driving off a steady revenue of students, as well as crippling industries where foreign students help and push forward the flow of information and development of oneself and country.

Even the people saying that this will help ""give jobs back to people from the country"" clearly are not willing to acknowledge that most of the time the clearly qualified people for these jobs are people from overseas.
The people who support these ideas and wish to push this further clearly wish to cripple the idea of ""big business UK"", and have a mind set stuck in a world that doesn't need to develop to stay prevalent in this day and age.

For me, that makes sense, seeing that a lot of these courses are just English language courses, or thinly veiled offers to get entrance to the UK (e.g. Empire College London). I accept that some people on here are happy to have unlimited immigration, but most of the country feel that immigration is too high. 

Right now there is also an issue that students overstay their visas. IF they are required to leave the UK before applying to legally work here, that means this will be less of an issue.

I also find it strange that many of the people complaining about some graduates having to leave and not re-enter are the same people that were complaining about students being included in the immigration figures as it 'wasn't permanent migration'.

&gt;Global CO2 emissions reached a new high of 35.3 billion tonnes (Gt) CO2 (Figure 2.1) in 2013, which is an increase of 0.7 Gt or 2.0% compared to the previous year. This moderate increase is similar to the actual increase in 2012 of 0.6 Gt or 1.7% (excluding leap year correction). **After an average annual increase of CO2 emissions of 1.1 Gt or 3.8% per year since 2003 – when excluding the effect of the credit crunch recession years 2008 and 2009 – the annual increases in 2012 and 2013 in global CO2 emissions are about half of the increases in the preceding decade, albeit higher than the average annual increase in the 1995–2002 period.** The average annual increase over the 1995–2002 period (after recession in the former Soviet Union countries) was about 1.2% or 0.4 Gt CO2 per year. The increase in emissions over the 2012–2013 period is much smaller than expected, given that in 2012 
and 2013 the global economy grew by 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, which is slightly less than the average annual 3.9% growth rate of GDP since 2003 (again excluding the 2008–2009 years) (IMF, 2014)",null,0,null,1436807227,null,0,1436807527,0,ct1vr5e,null,t3_3d3jki,null,t1_ct1vr5e,null,t1_ct1tscg,null,null,null,1437821738,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

If you include [imported emissions](http://www.emissions.leeds.ac.uk/chart1.html) then we only started to reduce them after the financial crisis, which is further evidence that recession is the only mechanism which we know for sure works.

&gt;  That's a different argument. And I suspect the government will know best on that one. 

Ha!  The same government which completely missed the financial crisis, the mid-century oil price spike and perfectly executed the Iraq invasion?  I know quite a few researchers in climate and energy studies, and one pretty common complaint is that government largely ignores their advice when they don't like it, which is most of the time.

&gt;  your version of what will take place goes in to the territory of doom mongering.

You are aware that we're currently tracking [RCP 8.5](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n1/fig_tab/nclimate1783_F1.html), which if we're unlucky with the climate sensitivity (or if there are nonlinearities which we're not yet aware of in the forcincs) has us above 2C of warming by mid century, and heading towards something geuinely apocalyptic by 2100.

&gt;  If we're going to solve global warming, we need to look at things we can easily change like power generation, not at things that can't be replaced.

You're implying that it's easier to decarbonise our entire power generation infrastructure than it is to drastically reduce the number of commercial flights?  Wow.

As for nuclear, if China keep pressing ahead with their reactor buildout there are going to be some pretty serious uranium shortgages in the next decade or so.

City. I am not sure what they are doing. Theyve got Sterling and tbh he will probably do well there. But I think they missed a trick not signing Kondogbia. He was there for the taking. Now he is gone, Delph rejected them and Pogba won't happen. I don't see them getting De Bruyne either. So not sure what they are doing. They certainly need some more midfielders both centre and attacking/wings even after signing Sterling

Not sure what Arsenal are doing either. Cech is a great signing for them but I really don't know who else they will sign. They missed out on Schniederlin. Perhaps it is too early to judge their window as they have only signed one player. But knowing Wenger I wouldnt be suprised if he is overconfident and thinks Cech is enough to keep the fans happy and the team stable. Although I do think Arsenal will go for one more big signing.  
United can fuck off. Pissing me off with the fact they are spending money and making signings. Without wanting to sound bitter I can only say Bastian is a gamble due to his fitness and injury problems plus his age and why people are overating Darmian I don't know. But you got to give them credit Schniederlin, Depay and Bastian (if fit) are good signings.

Spurs ain't doing much yet. Although they have realised their defense is weak and so are strengthening it. That being said Trippier and Wimmer will surely just be rotation options. Fair enough though Alderweireld is a decent player.

Just hope United or Arsenal don't sign Lacazette

United has also been said to be 'snubbed' by him as well, OL came out and said that PSG 'could not afford' to buy thier duo of Fekir and Lacazette as was rumored in France a few months ago, and while this is for sure a tactic, your idea that 20-25 million for the Europe's hottest striker prospect will get the deal done in an instant is ludicrous. Especially since clubs know were flush with 75m euros from Sterling. 

My point of why the fuck is he still at lyon still stands lol, because if he really was available for 20-25 million he would have been snapped up by now.

The best part of your comment is how you completely confirmed my suspicion that you thought Ayre could simply phone up lyon, say 25 m for Lacazette and hang up and we would see him in a red shirt in 10 days. You are delusional, we just paid about 30 for Firminio, and it seems like there are more clubs in on Lacazette.

And no, I won't be stunned if he moves to a smaller club in the second tier, but I will be if it is for the 25m you seem to think he is available for, but I would not be surprised if he did go to PSG or Real either. (btw you said that lacazette was cheaper than benteke at 25-30 so stop saying Lacazette for 30 all of a sudden you said hes cheaper)

The only some what interesting point you have made so far is the fact that this is a BR buy and that he wants Benteke over Lacazette due to philosophical reasons, I have not heard any of that other than the article you linked from 2012, I am genuinely interested in this, do you have anything more recent? Because if thats true, I want Rogers shipped out to Antartica on the first iceburg. Id take Lacazette for days and days over Benteke, and I like Benteke but like you said Lacazette fits in so many ways. 

 That might be worth discussing further but as far as Lacazette goes, lets agree to disagree. 

You clearly have your mind made up that Lacazette is a so so prospect at a desperate Ligue 1 side that would jump at the chance to sell their best player at 20-25 million, there really is no point talking to you about him anymore.",null,0,null,1436809395,null,0,false,0,ct1x7i5,null,t3_3d40es,null,t1_ct1x7i5,null,t1_ct1u6o2,null,null,null,1437822600,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Why do people find it so hard to believe that players can think they have a few more gears/levels in them?

Sure it seems obvious to us that he wont cut it, but there are many examples of late bloomers and people working harder than others for their opportunities.  

I'll be damned if there are a lot of professionals in the top leagues that don't believe secretly they can be the best.

The actors end up sounding a bit like trained parrots, repeatedly saying the same things in the same words (which, to their credit, they managed to do without steam coming out of their ears -- their patience and calmness under these circumstances was remarkable, IMO).  Of course we all understand the necessity for a sort of playbook + gag order (you can say this and this and this about S9, but THAT'S ALL). If there *were* a major revelation on a panel, some fans would swamp the net with anger that ""Moffat deliberately afflicted us with spoilers!  S9 is ruined!  I'll never watch DW again!""

It amazes me that Moffat-haters constantly blame him for lying, teasing, ""playing games"" with the fans' expectations, etc.  I look at it this way: ""spoiling"" the next season means spoiling the delight most viewers get from being surprised by the show. But DW fans are mostly (by all appearances) brighter than the general run of TV watchers, the way people who read SF *tend to be* sharper (if nerdier) than the average.  So some of us take it as a personal challenge to figure stuff out before anyone else does.  Steven M., in turn, has to take extra precautions to fend off fan inquisitiveness -- to *protect* the pleasure that the greater portion of fans look forward to in being surprised by the show (for which effort he gets constant stick).

It's hardly a pleasant position to be in -- and if he can turn it into a game, with some rewards in it for himself, I don't see why he gets blamed (in certain quarters) for it.  As for Capaldi or Coleman or Gomez, playing along is part of the publicity aspect of their work on the show, and I admire them for being able to keep it fresh, funny, and interesting despite the limited ""script"" they were confined to with regard to the Secrets of S9.  It was brilliant to have the season trailer on hand to give the fans something to dissect among themselves.

We've got to take into consideration Firmino now - and ontop of that Rodgers doesn't have to play 3 at the back.

Then like you said, what if we do bring in Benteke (Well, the TC want to bring a striker in - that much intent we can see, right?) 

So we bring in striker X, we have a fit Sturridge who's just looking at his 85-90%, how does Rodgers set this up, does he go back to two strikers or not? Then you've got Firmino who can play a false 9 if need be. Its quite something really, exciting.

tl;dr: to a lot of British people mass immigration is like a vindaloo but British people prefer a mild chicken curry.

An interesting experience I had in life was moving from a largely white background to Bradford. Bradford itself is nothing unique in terms of cities with large numbers of immigrants, it simply has a lot of them. I am not a racist or xenophobe so this fact didn't bother me. My experience with so many different cultures was a huge novelty since I came from a predominantly white background and had literally only met a couple of different cultures in my life (but quite a few different races). My experience went like this:

At first it was great discovering different cultures from all over the world. It certainly was mind expanding and even fun. I had no problems with them the entire time I was living in Bradford (several years). However, once the novelty wore off the cracks started to show. These were not deliberate or malicious actions by immigrants, just unavoidable consequences of mass multiculturalism. Essentially the problem was it was difficult for us to relate to each other (not that we weren't doing it anyway), but for example things like humour (theirs may have been too brash, or British too subtle), or tastes in food or drink (things like sausage and mash was often seen as basic and unappealing). Leisure activities (eastern Europeans seem to have loud, raucous parties with lots of spirits, frequently), ways of life (at times I felt awkward doing typical British stuff because my immigrant friends would look on as if I was weird, not that they were rude about it).

Then there were practical problems, usually relating to the language barrier. Having to repeat myself numerous times, having to ask them to repeat themselves. And there is only so many times I can hear my name mispronounced before it starts to get annoying.

What at first was an exciting experience of multiculturalism became suffocating and isolating - despite being friends with plenty of immigrants right to the end of my time in Bradford, I was quite happy to get back to my home town. Although, at least I could do this, if my hometown became like Bradford I am not sure what I would do.

I have nothing against immigrants as people, and certainly don't deny their motives for being in Britain are reasonable. However, for the average English person (which I consider myself) mass multiculturalism (note: not all, just mass) is unappealing, and the threat, whether real or imagined, of it overriding/nullifying British values is a very scary prospect.

Anyway, that's my take on the issue. Hope this gives some helpful insight",null,0,null,1436810271,null,0,false,0,ct1xsqy,null,t3_3d46j9,null,t1_ct1xsqy,null,t1_ct1ssv6,null,null,null,1437822983,null,5,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,5,null

For instance, the lifetime allowance is now £1.25million, next financial year it will be £1million, and I believe in 2013 (although I cant find it on the gov website at the moment) it was £1.4m. 

Imagine you had put £0.9m into your pot, and the new government decides the lifetime limit is now £0.75m. You could then have a punitive tax rate applied to the excess and any gains until you retire.

I hope you read what I wrote correctly, I didn't say Lacazette WILL GO to Roma, I said if Lacazette was to move now, he will go to a club of our or Roma's stature and that the only way he will go to a club that he will go to a rich club is if it is a last ditch transfer after all the other big names on the market are gone.

Lyon's CL status is a complete non factor cause he will definitely move to a bigger club, with bigger reach and exposure and he will get more wages, and let's be honest, it is not like Lyon are one of the contenders to win the CL.

As regards to Rodgers, he always wanted a target man as a focal point of his attack. This is his blue print and at Swansea he had Danny Graham, last season, the Anfield Wrap mentioned he wanted Bony but the committee wouldn't accept Swansea's asking price and we got this whole fiasco with Balotelli after the Remy transfer collapsed. This year, he also preferred to play the waiting game with a target man in Benteke rather than finishing the Bacca transfer off.

It is his decision, but ultimately, Benteke is not only not suited to our team, he will make players like Coutinho and Firmino worse by standing in their position because he wants the ball played at his feet.

Which as I point out is also Government policy because every Government pledges to crack down on tax evasion - but you intentionally ignored that. It is more difficult than just making people pay up, and the funding proposals you are suggesting (at least a return to the 2010 situation of welfare spending, more likely more than that) cannot be financed from reduced tax evasion. 

Taxes will have to go up to finance what you are proposing, or we borrow more, or we cut somewhere else. Mathematically, those are your options.

You can go into law with almost any background thanks to the GDL. All you have to be able to do is show that what you learned could be applicable to your job.

It is much easier to get funding for your training and an employment contract as a solicitor, especially as the legal reforms since 1990 are permitting solicitors to speak in court as advocates and we could well be moving towards a European/American-style single legal profession. 

If law is a career you'd be interested in, you have the choice of doing a degree in law and then doing the LPC, or doing another degree and then doing the GDL and LPC. Intake at London firms is about 50% from the first stream and 50% from the second from purely anecdotal evidence I obtained.

But ask yourself *why* you want to be a solicitor (clue: 'lots of money' shouldn't be your only justification) before you go down the route.

No arguments there... but the institutions can be, and are being taken down already. This affects *everyone*.

Firstly, a recent graduate might not have the easy capital to go home and come back to the UK.

In general, doing that puts them off. Psychologically, people want to stay where it's easy, convenient for them to stay and where they feel they are wanted.

* Goldman Sachs and Google are investors in Uber but as yet don't take dividends (as far as I know). They're waiting for it to be sold on. Not a massive difference obviously but important to remember. Especially when he keeps name-dropping them. 

* Black Cabs are much more expensive than Uber. I know they tripped the other day but that is not the usual experience of Uber. Also despite what he is saying about 'making a deal' you'll find most Cabbies will just look at the meter. I also am guessing the price of the cabs were a lot higher that day as well. 

* He keeps going on about tax. I am not sure if Uber doesn't pay tax on the income they get in the UK. Saying 'Goldman Sachs' doesn't constitute proof.

Not a surprise but aside from the populist rhetoric of tax evasion, naming David Cameron and saying you should support your local community Brand fails to make a coherent argument. He does what he usually does which is hit the hot topics and try and tie that into the issue of the day. 

The nearest he comes to making a valid point is that Uber may well increase their prices if they drive everyone out of the market but that in turn will leave them vulnerable to someone doing the same to them. 

There is only one group in this dispute acting in an anti-competitive fashion and that is the Black Cabs by organising disruptive protests designed to force Uber out of their market for which they want a monopoly. A monopoly which means Black Cabs are extremely expensive.

Now to the fun stuff. I completely agree with you about the Benteke, he is a very frustrating plyaer and has potential to be like another Mario situation.

Remember you can't restrict a litrebike, it has to be within a stone's throw of the target power originally. I don't have the link with me. Find out the max power restrictable online.

&gt; Can I make my own? My idea is to make a washer that will reduce the intake port cross sectional area to a desired percentage, bringing it to within legal limits.

**Username:** /u/TheDrCK        
**Original Post:**          
&gt;**About the product**

The modular RM series is a great bit of kit, running silently up to 40% load, and producing barely 25dB even at 100% load. In the words of [Guru3D](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_rm_650_watt_gold_psu_review,7.html):

&gt;The RM 650 definitely belongs where it is positioned, in the upper range of mainstream even towards high-end series. The power supply does what the doctor ordered, it's really silent and the efficiency was very respectable. This Gold certified PSU we think is spot on, at certain loads even closing in to Platinum levels.

**Condition**

The item is factory sealed and thus comes with all original packaging. It'll be shipped via recorded delivery in a parcel with appropriate padding to ensure the product reaches you in perfect condition.

**Price**

I'm selling the PSU for £80 inclusive of delivery costs. The units currently retails between £90-100, depending where you shop. 

Payment is to be made via Paypal. Gift is always appreciated, but I understand if you'd prefer not to.

We've also decided pre-eminently opposing immigration is a 'right-wing' position, thereby granting the right all the support on this issue, and as the issue grows, our support lessens. I have no idea where you get this fanciful idea from that in the middle of a recovery when money is scarce and people are experiencing heavy cuts, that we are somehow obligated to build all this infrastructure and housing for people that dont even live here, and wouldn't live here if immigration controls were harder. Housing and infrastructure for the people *already* here, along with the welfare state, is our priority to sustain already. 

The essence of this argument is literally 'we can build homes for people that come here, lets do that because we can because not doing it would be bad because reasons'. The question we should be asking is *why* are we supposed to be building all these homes for people who come here? This then brings us onto opposing immigration to begin with, because in a time of economic adjustment having low-skilled migration that companies will preferably hire to local British workers, combined with the fact that 300,000 people a year and growing is simply not remotely sustainable physically or financially, and would be incredibly expensive to continuously adjust to. Then there's the issue of cultural adjustment, where (although this is more arguable) enclaves are forming where adoption of British/Western values is not taking hold because of large numbers of foreigners conglomerating, and certain cultures are less compatible than others.

null,false,ZenWanderer,null,null,null,"For full disclosure, I work as financial adviser.

I won't comment on your personal circumstances or the suitability of your investments as I don't feel comfortable doing so given the limited information above but I will share my two cents on one of the general points you've raised.

As for maxing out your ISA as soon as possible per year or adding to it regularly, there are pros and cons for doing both. By maxing out as soon as possible per year, you're ensuring your assets are invested as soon as possible. This brings with it risk. When your capital is in cash, you can be relatively sure it won't go down in value but you also accept the fact that it is quite unlikely to see any serious gains either. By moving £15,240 into an ISA and investing it as soon as possible each tax year, you are now putting that whole amount at risk all at once. If you see consistent growth in your chosen investment over the next 12 months you'll have benefitted from this method of investing over adding regular amounts because the whole £15,250 has been invested and growing for the whole 12 months.

If however the markets you are invested in have been volatile (and they usually are, just see the monthly movements on the M&amp;G Extra Income fund [here](http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=MGEY)) then there is usually greater benefit in regular contributions. Regular monthly contributions will help to smooth out returns, as you pointed out, minimising market fluctuations.

In terms of returns, and the smoothing effect of regular contributions, market volatility can be a good thing and you can benefit from it greatly. Let's say you're investing £1000 per month into your ISA and it's all going into one fund. At the point of investment in month one, the fund is trading at one unit for 100p, so by investing £1000 into the fund you now own 1000 units. In month two the unit price has fallen to 95p per unit as a result of poor fund performance. In month two your £1000 buys 1052.63 units at a price of 95p per unit, so you now own a total of 2052.63 units with a total value of £1950. In month three, the unit price of the fund has fallen to 92p per unit, so your £1000 now buys 1086.96 units of your chosen fund. You now have a total of 3139.58 units with a total value of £2888.42. Now in month four the fund has rallied and is now worth 103p per unit, so your £1000 buys 970.87 units. You now have a total of 4110.45 units valued at 103p each, so your total fund value would be £4233.78 at the start of month four.

Now let's compare this to an example where the fund price rises each month. Again at month one when you begin with the first regular investment amount of £1000, the fund's unit price is 100p per unit and so you buy 1000 units. The fund value rises over the next month and buy the time your second £1000 goes in, the unit price is 101p per unit, so in month two your £1000 buys 990.1 units, giving you a total of 1990.1 units at 101p each. at the start of month three the unit price of the fund has risen again to 102p per unit, so this month your £1000 buys you 980.39 units, giving you a total fund holding of 2970.49 and total value of £3029.90. By month four, the fund value has risen again to a price of 103p per unit, so like the first example your £1000 buys you 970.97 units in your fund. By month four you now have a total unit amount of 3941.46 valued at 103p each, therefore a total fund value of £4059.70

Although the fund price is the same in both examples by the start of month four, example one has made £174.08 more profit on the total investment of £4000. This shows that, for a regular monthly investment, a fund with volatile performance would create a greater return than a fund with consistently positive performance. This phenomenon is known as pound cost averaging or dollar cost averaging. I am not trying to give you advice either way but hopefully have helped shine some light on the situation to help you better make your own decision.

We're short of doctors because: 

1) Doctors aren't highly paid here unless they go private. You can make 4x as much in america.

They never get their way anyway unless your views coincide with those who pay the bribes.

You have to get your rose tinted glasses off that the UK isn't corrupt. Our MPs, councilors and representatives are stunningly corrupt and makes countries like China look like amateurs. You know why?

How do you defend that? 

When I grew up, I attended bonfires in nationalist neighbourhoods where British symbols were burned. I've since grew up like everyone else and would never ever participate or defend the building of bonfires - especially those where British symbols are being burned. The difference between the Catholic bonfire night and the Protestant one is that you don't have adults coming out on television and the radio and actually promoting these bonfires (definitely less so anyway). 

I honestly think it's time that the PUL crowd grow up too, and distance themselves from the mindless hatred that is demonstrated at these bonfires.

**Username:** /u/TheDrCK        
**Original Post:**          
&gt;**About the product**

The modular RM series is a great bit of kit, running silently up to 40% load, and producing barely 25dB even at 100% load. In the words of [Guru3D](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_rm_650_watt_gold_psu_review,7.html):

&gt;The RM 650 definitely belongs where it is positioned, in the upper range of mainstream even towards high-end series. The power supply does what the doctor ordered, it's really silent and the efficiency was very respectable. This Gold certified PSU we think is spot on, at certain loads even closing in to Platinum levels.

**Condition**

The item is factory sealed and thus comes with all original packaging. It'll be shipped via recorded delivery in a parcel with appropriate padding to ensure the product reaches you in perfect condition.

**Price**

I'm selling the PSU for £80 inclusive of delivery costs. The units currently retails between £90-100, depending where you shop. 

Payment is to be made via Paypal.

They had plenty of time to train and rest right from the beginning which won't be the case this season. Seeing so many changes to the starting lineup too, I'm therefore skeptical of them hitting top form right from the off.

Other than that they have a very good squad for sure. Agree with the points you made regarding their signings; some of the recruitment has been excellent. 

But I expect City (who still have their fair share of money to spend) to pounce back strongly. Lets not forget they have won the league twice in the last 4 seasons. Arsenal's challenge will be more down to the stability and they'd hope they can condition themselves better for a sustained title challenge. 

Perhaps I'm only underestimating LVG's ability to get the best of his team in a such a short period but its only because I think City and Arsenal are in a much more stable position that I consider them to run us much closer than United. But then again I see your points regarding their form in the second half of last season and can't disagree with you. Who knows, maybe Arsenal might falter again at the start, maybe United might race through like we did last season.

So selecting a random moment in time with no further information known about whether it's at a high or a low, you're probably better off being in rather than out.

*But*, regular investment is a good habit to form if it means you don't forget/delay, and thereby end up with more invested for more of the time, rather than having cash earmarked for investment sat idle until you get around to making a deposit.

Also it can be psychologically easier to endure a loss (and not panic and sell at the bottom) if you're buying gradually.

This happened in Liverpool City Centre at 2am, there can't have been a great deal going on because the officers had time to be concerned with what they suspected might be a *minor* drugs offence - a 'crime' that most City Centre Police would ignore because they're there to deal with public order. 

The general policy is to avoid all but the most egregious offences in order to keep bodies on the street and keep the custody suite manageable in most *busy* town centres.

An arrest would put both officers back at the station for 4 hours while they dealt with the paperwork and if they were at the end of their shift they would get overtime - this was potentially their goal.

Don't disagree that both the officer and guy in question were being dicks, but the officers interest in such interest in such a common transaction and minor offence makes me very suspicious of their motives.

**Username:** /u/TheDrCK        
**Original Post:**          
&gt;**About the product**

The modular RM series is a great bit of kit, running silently up to 40% load, and producing barely 25dB even at 100% load. In the words of [Guru3D](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_rm_650_watt_gold_psu_review,7.html):

&gt;The RM 650 definitely belongs where it is positioned, in the upper range of mainstream even towards high-end series. The power supply does what the doctor ordered, it's really silent and the efficiency was very respectable. This Gold certified PSU we think is spot on, at certain loads even closing in to Platinum levels.

**Condition**

The item is factory sealed and thus comes with all original packaging. It'll be shipped via recorded delivery in a parcel with appropriate padding to ensure the product reaches you in perfect condition.

**Price**

I'm selling the PSU for £80 inclusive of delivery costs. The units currently retails between £90-100, depending where you shop. 

Payment is to be made via Paypal.

So we have no right of recall. MPs can do whatever they want 1 second after election day and we can do nothing about it. Secondly we are only allowed to vote for the candidates which the state machinery backs. We let the odd independent in as a red herring to make it seem like anybody can stand as an MP but in reality is it the bought parties which get most of the seats.

&gt;And that's something you should be vocal against. We weren't, and that's why it happened. We can be vocal now and undo the bad that happened before.

I've actually mostly given up on Britain tbh, which is why I don't bother. I don't bother because I know I won't be heard. My voice vs a guy with a dump truck of money?  

&gt;Proof please. Prove every MP ""obeys those who pay the bribes"". I'll throw you a bone... Don't bother proving all of them do, just a third. No no... A tenth.

Ah young one eh? Don't you remember the Blair regime? 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/937232.stm

A man gives £1 million to Labour. All of a sudden F1 gets a smoking advertising exemption? We are supposed to believe there was no link between these two events? Remember this is only what was exposed. Tip of the iceberg. There are numerous examples of corruption like Blunkett. Super pro-ID cards yet quite by coincidence he gets a job at the company that was supposed to produce and benefit massively from them? 

You want me to believe he ironed his suit typed up his CV in finest boiler plate and went for a job interview?

Again under the Blair reign of terror. He writes a good reference to Mittal who gets a loan, this loan is used to destroy the British steel industry.

Or the S Korean oil firm which gave Blair 10 million to invade Iraq after the event. 

If you look on arrse you will see British military procurement mysteries. If you look deeper into this you will realise that many of these are a result of corruption. The civil servant who OKs the deal or the MP who does so again quite by coincidence you'll find of course (cus we're British and we don't do corruption! Whiter than white!) gets a job with the company that massively benefited from the procurement fuck up.

&gt;Our politicians are not perfect but they're not the devil either... And really REALLY make the Chinese look like amateurs?

They are worse you know why? Because we have this idea that oh we're British we can't be corrupt! You see what is happening in China? REAL penalties, prison time, death sentences for corruption. A UK MP gets caught. I apologise! Lessons will be learned brush it under the carpet and no consequences. No consequences merely encourages them.

In addition, not all saturated fats are treated the same. Meat fat is linked with high cholesterol, whereas dairy saturated fat seems to be protective.

What's also interesting is that body fat is more important to cholesterol and blood lipids, etc. than is dietary fat. People have done the experiments; if people lose weight, even on a high saturated fat diet, every single measure of blood chemistry improves: total cholesterol goes down, HDL (good) cholesterol goes up, blood sugar goes down, etc.

This is the logic behind things such as the Atkins diet. The important thing is to lose weight, and it doesn't matter much what you eat.

However, the reason the Atkins diet works for is one of satiety. Fats, especially saturated fats, produce a sensation of satiety; not unsurprisingly, because of their very high calorie density. However, carbs, particularly refined carbs and sugars, block that sensation. There are no natural foods that contain significant fat and carbohydrate in one item; so this has never been a significant issue in evolutionary history. However, even a mixture of non-refined carbs and fat is tolerable in one meal.

""The poor"" of course are not all the same, my girlfriend's family didn't have much money when she was growing up but her family cooked healthy meals and didn't waste money on sugary drinks. Just because ""the poor"" as a group are statistically more likely to spend money on sugary drinks doesn't mean we should be against this tax, we shouldn't rule out increasing taxation on completely non-essential items like sugary drinks just because the tax can be seen as regressive based on people's current buying trends.

&gt;So we have no right of recall. MPs can do whatever they want 1 second after election day and we can do nothing about it. Secondly we are only allowed to vote for the candidates which the state machinery backs. We let the odd independent in as a red herring to make it seem like anybody can stand as an MP but in reality is it the bought parties which get most of the seats.

Seriously? You say this just after the SNP get the best result they ever have? The most fractured couple of elections in living memory and you think its bought parties? FFS.

And right of recall... I'm not entirely sure what you mean. You want to have ultimate veto if you don't get exactly what you want? On what criteria?

You get veto the next election. 

&gt;&gt;And that's something you should be vocal against. We weren't, and that's why it happened. We can be vocal now and undo the bad that happened before.

&gt;I've actually mostly given up on Britain tbh, which is why I don't bother. I don't bother because I know I won't be heard. My voice vs a guy with a dump truck of money?  

Speaks volumes. 

&gt;&gt;Proof please. Prove every MP ""obeys those who pay the bribes"". I'll throw you a bone... Don't bother proving all of them do, just a third. No no... A tenth.

&gt;Ah young one eh? Don't you remember the Blair regime? 

&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/937232m

I'll say again. Proof please. Prove every MP ""obeys those who pay the bribes"". I'll throw you a bone... Don't bother proving all of them do, just a third. No no... A tenth.

&gt;A man gives £1 million to Labour. All of a sudden F1 gets a smoking advertising exemption? We are supposed to believe there was no link between these two events? Remember this is only what was exposed. Tip of the iceberg. There are numerous examples of corruption like Blunkett. Super pro-ID cards yet quite by coincidence he gets a job at the company that was supposed to produce and benefit massively from them? 

I'll say a third time. Proof please. Prove every MP ""obeys those who pay the bribes"". I'll throw you a bone... Don't bother proving all of them do, just a third. No no... A tenth.

&gt;You want me to believe he ironed his suit typed up his CV in finest boiler plate and went for a job interview?

A fourth. Proof please. Prove every MP ""obeys those who pay the bribes"". I'll throw you a bone... Don't bother proving all of them do, just a third. No no... A tenth.

&gt;Again under the Blair reign of terror. He writes a good reference to Mittal who gets a loan, this loan is used to destroy the British steel industry.

Oh FFS.

&gt;Or the S Korean oil firm which gave Blair 10 million to invade Iraq after the event. 

Pfft. So let's assume that's true (it isn't). How does that affect the political landscape more than ten years later?

&gt;If you look on arrse you will see British military procurement mysteries. If you look deeper into this you will realise that many of these are a result of corruption. The civil servant who OKs the deal or the MP who does so again quite by coincidence you'll find of course (cus we're British and we don't do corruption! Whiter than white!) gets a job with the company that massively benefited from the procurement fuck up.

Evidence please. Prove it is widespread and day to day practice. 

Or is it the odd person that gets caught and tripped?

&gt;&gt;Our politicians are not perfect but they're not the devil either... And really REALLY make the Chinese look like amateurs?

&gt;They are worse you know why? Because we have this idea that oh we're British we can't be corrupt! You see what is happening in China? REAL penalties, prison time, death sentences for corruption. A UK MP gets caught. I apologise! Lessons will be learned brush it under the carpet and no consequences. No consequences merely encourages them.

A UK MP gets caught they get prison time, massive fines... They're even given fines for using government money to campaign.

&gt; The fair solution is obvious: those that fly more should pay more.

&gt; The majority shouldn’t have  to subsidise the air miles lifestyle of the elite. 

The whole premise of this is just bizarre; just why? What is charging ""rich"" people more going to do to stop climate change? If frequent fliers are so ""elite"" as this article bizarrely calls them, then a price increase will do nothing to stop them. It just discourages regular people from making potentially necessary flights. 

But anyway, that's beside the point. The entire ""fairer way to fly"" PDF is incredibly amateurish, cherry picking information to support points without referencing contrary information from the same sources.

&gt; Unlike many other sectors, aviation is not expected
to make absolute reductions in its emissions between
now and 2050. The sector’s allocation of the total
UK carbon budget is expected to increase from 6% in
2011 to 25% in 2050.7

Well, the first source they use in their argument from the CCC mentions how ""demand for flying can continue to increase while still meeting climate objectives"" because more fuel efficient planes can allow for a 60% increase on current passenger levels. It also only increases to 25% overall because we *expect to make reductions to our overall emissions*. This doesn't mean airline emissions are quadrupling like they are trying to imply. 

&gt;  It is estimated that only 15%
of the population takes 70% of the flights

This figure isn't actually measured anywhere in the entire source they quoted [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-experiences-of-and-attitudes-towards-air-travel-2014) so I don't know where they pulled that one. This report seems to be the original source for this figure all over the internet, and as far as I can tell they've just made it up.

I know quite a few researchers in climate and energy studies, and one pretty common complaint is that government largely ignores their advice when they don't like it, which is most of the time.

I'm talking about the argument for another runway, and I do trust the government on that. It's a fairly solid economic one. 

&gt;You are aware that we're currently tracking RCP 8.5[2] , which if we're unlucky with the climate sensitivity (or if there are nonlinearities which we're not yet aware of in the forcincs) has us above 2C of warming by mid century, and heading towards something geuinely apocalyptic by 2100.

This is not surprising, considering that many parts of the developing world are still industrialising, but the way to resolve that is through green technology like alternative fuels, not just restricting airport development. 

&gt;You're implying that it's easier to decarbonise our entire power generation infrastructure than it is to drastically reduce the number of commercial flights? Wow.

Yes! Governments can realistically encourage and promote green energy, as can consumers. Governments and consumers cannot and will not stop flying, as it's an essential part of the modern world. 

&gt;As for nuclear, if China keep pressing ahead with their reactor buildout there are going to be some pretty serious uranium shortgages in the next decade or so. Combine that with the ludicrous capital cost, long lead time and numerous other factors[3] mean that it's unlikely to be scalable within the timeframe required.

And while they're using nuclear, they're not burning fossil fuels, which benefits us all until we can have truly renewable energy. Stop seeing the problems and start seeing the solutions!

If Soldado remains with the team I would not be upset. Partially because I wan't him to come good and tear it up like a motherfucker.

However without the aforementioned tearing up taking place, he is a great role model for younger players. The fact that most people still support him despite 2 pretty much horrendous seasons in terms of goals scores shows that fans value work rate, effort, and loyalty as much as anything else.

For example Kane can look at Soldado and know that even if he hits a dry patch, that hard work and determination will keep the fans onside.

On the flip side you have Adebayor, a player who a lot of people dislike, even when he is putting away goals for fun.

My point is that Raheem was a product that moved itself. We said the entire time that we want 50m. Acting like an ass didn't change that. He left when we got 50m. And the 200k/w? That was a massive part of City's allure in the first place. I think he could have got that without putting on the sideshow, hurting his reputation, and heaping greater pressure on himself to do well in a City shirt. That offer (or thereabouts) was probably on the table since Day 1.

On top of that, the Berahino factor. Ward lost his only other client because of the way he handled the two of them. Berahino was also a product that moved itself, but his behaviour (however much you want to attribute it to Ward) actually prevented a move. Ward sabotaged his only other potential payday.

&gt;The body fat percentages have nothing to do with it either. We're talking about people with percentages of at least 30% here. 

Again I'll point out that, 30% body fat on a women is significantly more fatter than a man at 30%.


&gt;The average person will not go below 15% unless they are severely underweight or training and really trying to get to 10% (which would be what men trying to maintain a six pack would aim for) 

Wrong, you'd be lucky to see a full six pack at 10%, yes 10% on a women and you'd see a six pack, 8% body fat on a women is equivalent to roughly 4% on a man. 

As for 15% being underweight, no! That's pretty much a healthy BF for any man. I've been lifting for 15 years, I'm well aware of what BF percentage is healthy. And if you are training as an athlete you maintain 15%ish to obtain optimal performance, you cut before a competition. 



&gt;Once again, this is not related to calories, this is something different entirely. 

The more BF you have, the easier it is to burn calories, so it is related.


Someone with low body fat percentages and a lot of muscle will eat the same amount of calories as someone with a high body fat percentage and no muscle of the same weight. (Unless the athletic person/sporter is cutting or bulking at that time of course)
