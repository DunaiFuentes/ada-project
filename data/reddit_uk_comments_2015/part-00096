Exploring is essentially like bounty hunting for planets, you find undiscovered celestial bodies, and when you discover them you keep this information, and you can sell this info to nearby stations for credits, if you have a scanner you can scan planets and stars for even more information and therefore even more credits. 

IIRC the best object for credits is a black hole, then certain types of stars, then planets. You can upgrade your ship to be able to jump a further distance, and therefore jump between star systems further away (so you don't need to stepping stone the long way around, you can go direct). 

As well as this you can get fuel scoops for you ship so you can ""scoop"" stars for fuel, so you really can go and explore and be lost and light years away from anyone as you explore the frontier. 

I don't know much about trading, but you can get cargo ships that have a high capacity cargo hold, but the more weight you carry the smaller your inter-system jumps are, and the more fuel costs.

....are you being real right now? There's a difference between having an employer with assets and the type of 'class-warfare' that you are talking about. 

&gt;Was a single state capitalist system if you look at it, along with an unjustified hierarchy of the Party and the People.

Ahh. The classic 'bu-but it's wasn't socialist!'. Firstly. How was it capitalist? Everything was involuntarily owned by the state. There was no free enterprise; a defining trait of a capitalist system. There was a central authority that had complete control over distribution of everything from groceries to power outlets. You are literally trying to tell me that grass is blue right now. And I can't understand why you can't see that. Also, why didn't you address the other countries I listed? Or, for the rest of this conversation, are you just going to pick and choose 2 or 3 lines from what the paragraphs that I say?

&gt;A worker must earn money to survive, so must work for a property owner who provides a means to production, again another definition of 'a class'.

For money you need to work. End of. You even do this in a socialist society; you work for the state. And if you don't work for the state? Then you are stuck on fixed-income benefits. The difference between capitalist and socialist work places is that in a capitalist market you have a choice on who you go to work force, which creates competition; a choice that is severely lacking in a socialist framework. You're also implying that the only work is employee work, which entirely ignores the importance of self-employed people and entrepreneurship.

&gt;You clearly know nothing about what anarchism means with all the points you raised.

Instead of just simply stating 'nah you don't know anything' why don't you actually engage in the points I raise; instead of looking like a complete retard.

&gt;Despite perhaps several thousand studies that report the preponderance of domestic violence to be perpetuated by males against females, there are also nearly 100 empirical studies or reports that suggest that rates of domestic violence are equivalent (see, for example, Archer, 2000, and Fiebert, 1997.)  In the United States, numerous studies have found that women and men are equally likely to report having hit their partner during the preceding 12 months.  In Great Britain, also, 4.2% of women and men said that had been physically assaulted by a partner during the previous 12 months (Tendler, 1999).  

&gt; Thus, activists for “men’s rights” have suggested that policy-oriented efforts for women have been misplaced, because they focus entirely on women as the victims of domestic violence.  Instead of the picture painted by feminist researchers and activists, these activists argue that, as one writer put it, “men are the victims of domestic violence at least as often as women” (Brott, 1994).

Pjanic and Milner would be brilliant signings. Milner already knows how to press from the front, and if you give Pjanic any space he'll (like Gerrard) hurt you.

I agree...if Lucas stays. If he goes then we need somebody to come in straight away. At the moment I don't think it's Can, unless we play three in midfield, as he seems to struggle when it's him and one other player.

I really really really want to get rid of Borini. I don't rate him, he's never been good enough and while I respect he wants to fight for his place it will never happen for him. And even worse, he's had a terrible season so we'd be lucky to get £7-10million for him imo.

Anything over 20 stone and it was go home.

The BPA specifically mandate a certain ratio of canopy to weight ratio. A certs can't go below 1:1 so you weigh 150lb you need 150sqft canopy.

While you CAN have massive massive massive canopies the tandem masters usually only have 3-4 rigs and it is uneconomical for them to have one which only gets used now and again. It is also a time issue. Tandem masters will go up and come down fast as possible by spin dives. Rip their rig off put another one on and get back on the plane as it is just landing. UK summers are short so they have to make hay when the sun shines. 

BKPC in Lancashire I was once part of. Paul Yeoman when they had the PC-6 get into plane strap up the guy doing the tandem. Jump out.

The PC-6 would then go into a steep dive and land about the same time as Paul. Paul would tear off his rig put another one on and get another tandem jumper on and hop back into the PC6 as it was turning around.

In those systems you get arrested and charged almost immediately and then held in detention for lengthy periods until the investigation is finished and the trial has ended. Sweden makes sure it carries out the investigation and then detains the suspect with the view to getting them before the courts as quickly as possible.

That means innocent people spend much less time detained in Sweden before being found not guilty than they would in other Western systems. Being imprisoned can be a harrowing ordeal for innocent people and the less time they are exposed to such detention the better.

You are somehow claiming that Sweden is responsible for Assange jumping his bail because they refuse to confirm their system, which is much fairer on the innocent defendant, to other Western systems which are comparatively incredibly harsh on innocent defendants.

The only person responsible for Assange jumping bail and this mess coming about is Assange himself. He has decided on multiple occasions that he should not be subject to the decisions of two different legal systems and even fucked over supporters who graciously put up, and subsequently lost, their own money to get him out on bail while his appeal was being heard in the UK courts.

&gt;whether or not he committed those crimes, a trial might very well tarnish his reputation and that of Wikileaks

I think the allegation does that regardless. The more conspiratorial might suggest that as a motive for the allegations. I'd love to see how many allegations of having consensual sex involving non-consensual acts of this kind are brought in Sweden each year! And how many are prosecuted, and how many convictions.

&gt;perhaps most likely, Assange's ego and politics have made him a little to paranoid

Of course this is possible, and legal reality *may* indeed be different. But surely the point is that when the stakes are as high as spending your life in Guantanamo, would you want to take that risk? As stated in my first post, there is enough sound basis for his level of caution.

&gt;The best legal minds have looked at this issue and concluded that there is no basis for fearing Sweden when he was comfortable being in the UK.

So you assert. Wikileaks' lawyers obviously disagree. I'd love to see an article that covers the issue properly if you have one (I've found common journalism on the issue rather lacking). Even if you think it is a wrong opinion that they hold, you can surely see the possibility with all the complexities in law and global politics (point again to the Bolivian Presidential plane) that they hold such a fear rationally and honestly.

**EDIT** others have brought up the [Repatriation of Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_of_Ahmed_Agiza_and_Muhammad_al-Zery), which I believe demonstrates both Sweden's willingness to bend to US pressure and extradite in the face of possible torture. Compare this to the situation in the UK, where [Abu Hamza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hamza_al-Masri) had the benefit of an 8 year legal battle before being finally extradited to the US by the UK, the evidence is that he situation for extradition is indeed much better in the UK than in Sweden.",null,0,null,1426265778,null,0,1426267485,0,cpdt60r,null,t3_2ywcu2,null,t1_cpdt60r,null,t1_cpdqtcn,null,null,null,1427741266,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

**Stuff to check before picking it up**:

Suzuki use two, very cheap bolts on the chain guard. If stock, they will be corroded. This is the only place this has happened on mine. Make sure they have changed them if the guard is standard. I suggest a rear hugger anyway, which will come with new (better quality) bolts.

Check the radiator grill hasn't been mashed up too much. Mine has taken a few hits over the years from stones. An extender fender for the front wheel is needed to prevent this. Cheap to avoid, costly to fix if the damage is bad.

Check the hoses. As far as I know, there are no reports of anything unusual, but given the age its time to think about changing them if they haven't already been done. The clutch is also hydraulic remember! If they haven't been changed, it's cheap to do, also consider braided lines at this point if you are going to be pushing it often. At such a weight, they are harder on brakes than most during twisties.

**Stuff to watch out for if you get it:**

Fit a rear shock tube, or even better a rear hugger. The shock is open to the back wheel as stock and a total nightmare.

The rear wheel adjustment guide will bend every time you tighten the axel nut when you do tension adjustments. I just keep a lump hammer and cloth handy and knock it back into place. Annoying, but not a huge deal.

At your height, you will probably want an aftermarket screen. I use and reccomend a Skidmarx double bubble. Fitting is a bit of a pain, but it is a once off job.

All the mainenance books will tell you to remove the fairing and dash to change bulbs or adjust beam height. Don't bother, just look up from under the front fairing and you can do it from there.

The air box is super fiddly to reach, when it comes time to change, do yourself a favour and get a reuseable one, I use K&amp;N but pick your favourite. They can go longer between services, save the planet and will kick up your top end a bit too.

My pont about the trial is that it would be far more damaging than a simple allegation, after all he could be found guilty. That's a very interesting point about how common these cases are, perhaps it is the risk of celebrity? In any case, having read the charges, I'm quite comfortable with them being crimes.

My problem with the idea that the stakes are spending life in Guantanamo is that Assange was perfectly happy to trust the UK legal system, where there have been controversial incidents with extraditions to America, yet find a problem with Sweden, for no disernable reason other than that is where he is accused of several very much non-political crimes. Moreover, there has been no extradition request, and being in Sweden would offer him two shots at fighting a theoretical request, one in Sweden with a much more favourable (to Assange) extradition treaty than the UK has!

Assange's lawyers don't neccessarily disagree, they have to fight there client's corner, still, good point, but judges ultimately decide the law. [Here](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/09/legal-mythology-extradition-julian-assange) is an interesting and quite well sourced view of the legal case.

I can understand the fears about laws being bypassed or bent, but remember in the case of the Bolivian plane, it was stopped. It was not searched.

So why has he got Manuel Pellegrini's name wrong for four years?

The Portuguese has referred to the Chilean as ""Mr Pellegrino"" since he took his job as manager of Real Madrid in 2010.

In Spain they believe it is feeble humour; a reference to a popular brand of bottled water, San Pellegrino.

What is certain is that this is English football's new feud, following the grudges between Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, and Fergie and Rafa Benitez. And as Rafa might say, Mourinho is winning. Fact.

The antipathy goes back to Pellegrini losing his job at Real. Unnecessarily and unpleasantly, Mourinho sniped at his predecessor, scoffing at Pellegrini's move to unfashionable Malaga.

Personally I recommend a slow cooker. It makes the best of cheap ingredients, makes huge batches of food in one go that you can chill/freeze, doesn't use much electricity etc. You can get one for a tenner in poundstretcher.

You could also hit up the CAB and ask them to do a benefits calculation for you to ensure you're getting everything you're entitled to. Some councils also offer hardship funds, but these are generally one off payments for a specific purpose rather than ongoing. 

As others have suggested, can't you mind the child during the day yourself and then do the 35hrs jobseeking whilst your wife is at home? BTW - they 'expect' you to do 35hrs. In reality that means applying for a few jobs a day and going to interviews when necessary. They know and you know there isn't 8 hours of applying online for jobs every day to be done, especially in smaller towns and rural areas.

And forgive me if I'm wrong but dont we have some more cash coming through off Negredo's deal, something around another £12 mil to come?

Thats player revenue of maybe around £65mil if we can make the sales, £77 if I was right about Negredo. On top of whatever were allowed to spend within our club revenue allowance without breaching FFP again, I really think we have quite alot of leaway for transfers, and I think Pogba is more than realistic if he's down for the move, and Kurzawa seems more likely everyday. Isco is just a personal favourite, his flair is just so enjoyable to watch. All of them are young too, and I think squad age is something we can all agree the clu needs to keep in mind going forward.

exercise their functions with a view to contributing to ending gender-based
violence, domestic abuse and sexual violence. The Bill also contains provision
to enable the Welsh Ministers to require Local Authorities, by regulations, to
publish information about how the Local Authority’s education functions are
being exercised to promote the purpose of the Bill. The Bill further contains
provision for the appointment of a Ministerial Adviser.

&gt;The overarching objective of the Bill is to improve the Public Sector response
in Wales to gender-based violence, domestic abuse and sexual violence. It is
intended to provide a strategic focus on these issues and ensure consistent
consideration of preventive, protective and supportive mechanisms in the
delivery of services.

&gt;7. The Welsh Government recognises in Wales, consistent with the rest of the
world, women are disproportionally impacted by all forms of intimate violence.
In recognition of this, the Bill contains provision to require persons exercising
relevant functions under the Bill to have regard, along with all other relevant
matters, to the need to remove or minimise factors which increase the risk, or
exacerbate the impact, of violence against women and girls. Although the
prevalence and severity of gender-based violence, domestic abuse and
sexual violence disproportionally affects women, the Bill recognises anyone
can be affected by such violence and abuse. Victims can be from across the
whole spectrum of society, including older people, all ethnicities, religions and
beliefs, people with disabilities and people from the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and
Transgender community.


&gt;Improving the response of public bodies
Issue

&gt;8. Although much has been done in Wales to tackle the issues of gender-based
violence, domestic abuse and sexual violence, the issues persist.

I think the stats used in point 9 might be why also they decided to highlight women more (even tho it's still large number for men)


&gt;9. The Office for National Statistics publishes annual figures on Violent Crime
and Sexual Offences based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales
(CSEW) as there are no Welsh specific figures. The 2012/13 CSEW selfcompletion
module on intimate violence, asked of adults aged 16 to 59,
covers experience of emotional, financial and physical abuse by partners or
family members, as well as sexual assaults and stalking by any person. It
found:

&gt;a. There were 7.1% of women and 4.4% of men in England and Wales who
reported having experienced any type of domestic abuse in the last year,
equivalent to an estimated 1.2 million female victims of domestic abuse and
700,000 male victims;

&gt;b. Overall, 30% of women and 16.3% of men in England and Wales had
experienced any domestic abuse since the age of 16, equivalent to an
estimated 4.9 million female victims of domestic abuse and 2.7 million male
victims;

I think that's the same for any celebrity, isn't it? The idea being, if enough people make some noise, he would at least notice something. That brings me to your next point.

&gt;Also how would he learn how to use reddit so easily. I see amas and many celebrities who use socialmedia still get help from that rachel woman.

Assuming we'll get to that stage, I think he won't obviously set up an AMA immediately. He will look into what reddit is. He'll most likely consult his PR people and also look at what other people do at /r/IAmA. But, all of this is speculation of course. I have nothing to back any of what I said.

 &gt;Thirdly you guys want him to do an ama for your benefit. He has no incentive himself and most amas done are usually to advertise something so there's another flaw

Eight years ago would be just before or just after IR and C&amp;E merged to form HMRC.  If it was before, I can guarantee you that which ever side you weren't in weren't much better organised than the part you were.

Headcount is down by about a third from around 90k FTE to 60k FTE and their budget is down about a quarter (£1.2bn) from around £4bn.  Most customer service has been abandoned and the walk-in enquiry centres are all closed; moving to heavily scripted call centres with lengthy call waiting times throughout the day.

It has been claimed that more staff have been moved to compliance work, though I'm not sold on that.  In relation to the set of HMRC accounts prior to the most current the PAC noted that where HMRC claimed record compliance revenues and to have reduced the tax gap, actual tax collected had in fact reduced and the tax gap, when looked at in monetary terms, had increased.

Just make sure you run the crack through https://www.virustotal.com/ which will run it againt 50 or so antiviruses a load will say it's a virus but some will say ""not a virus- crack"" .  

EDit: also if you install the crack make sure you read the instructions carefully and turn off User Account Control first and you'll probably need to set your anti-virus on to ignore that folder first.

Second, not all require a vote in Parliament - so again, being in government and making deals has an advantage.

The downside of course is that for some people making deals = selling out, but if you've got less than 1 in 10 of the MPs in Parliament (as the Lib Dems have), then I'd much rather make deals and get some results rather than sit on the Parliamentary sidelines and get no results.",null,0,null,1426270852,null,0,false,0,cpdw7sw,null,t3_2ywqfy,null,t1_cpdw7sw,null,t1_cpds20a,null,null,null,1427742811,null,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

Barcelona play like Barcelona and compared to a Chelsea or Atletico there is a definite difference in styles the AI will play. Defenders are much better about tracking runs than in FIFA. The higher rated players make a lot of dynamic runs and the passing allows for some great goals. Players like Hazard and Messi can rip you apart if you don't defend well. Tackling is all about timing and takes time to get use to but I highly suggest focussing on intercepting passes as it guarantees you possession. 

Tactics are way more dynamic, to the point where you can set your team to change formation based on if you have possession or not. The editor makes up for the lack of licenses for some leagues and really in-depth kit creation allows you to get around it. The most recent update added 40+ player faces to the game (including Harry who looks bang on perfect) and they are always adding.

 The matchmaking for online is a bit hit and miss which is disappointing but I think that's more down to a much smaller and spread out community of players.

null,false,isapple,null,null,null,"Nobody starts out being an ""exemplary fan"" to your standards, whatever that may be. Not everyone has to resources or the time to learn who our managers were for the past 3 decades and our famous matches, scandals, and such. Most people here were in elementary school when Abramovich bought the club, and the 2004+ years are the only years that they have experienced - and I think thats perfectly fine. Experiencing things directly makes things much easier to remember. 

For example the glorious 4-4 CL semifinal vs Liverpool is a night I will NEVER forget, and I'm sure every Chelsea fan who watched it will never forget that feeling when Alex just hammered that free kick, I still smile whenever I get flashbacks and when Drogba does the its over motion after Lamps scores the last goal off the post is a feeling I'll never be able to describe. This 4-4 result will have an entirely different meaning to a new fan, as to them it was an action packed game in a CL semifinal, and will not even compare to the semi vs Barcelona in 2012 if they witnessed that match, when for me both games are so memorable.

I think that if they screw up on some things it is our duty as ""senior fans"" to correct them, and they will learn and hopefully pass on the knowledge. I don't think people should have a duty to read books and whatnot. If Chelsea is a club they support and they follow the team matches and news and are excited for this and next season and shows loyalty, there is no difference between the noob and the fan who knows Zola's sex life you know? If they have misguided perceptions on players we just correct them with our opinions and if it holds weight for them they accept it, its as simple as that!

On the supplemented wages issue - I probably agree with you. Government shouldn't be subsidising low wages.

Scrap working tax credits.

McDonalds and KFC shareholders are the only people who benefit from that.

Classic case of foolhardy Government intervention.

If employers don't pay enough the employee will go elsewhere to somewhere that does.

Providing working tax credits allows all low wage payers to not change their practices.

If you spend a lump of money on a Rolex or watches of a similar cachet, it will more then likely still keep as good time 50 years from now as it does today (source: I have a 1963 Omega seamaster on my wrist as we speak). The same cannot be said for the iWatch, I would be very surprised if many of them will be running 10 years from now, certainly with the battery involved I would doubt that they would keep enough charge to last for a days use in more than 5 years. You then have the issue of Apple's software update and lifecycle, which will likely bring the lifecycle of the iwatch down even further, maybe four years based on the current trend for their products going end of life. The same would apply to the £50 watch from the high street. If we look at the Sam Vimes ""cheap boots you replace every year vs expensive boots you repair every 2 years"" analogy for watches, the same applies except your looking at 70 odd years of lifetime if not more.

Now obviously there is a market for the trinket side of the watches, The ludicrously wealthy may go for the top iWatches just to show of the bauble, if the market wasn't there Apple wouldn't have made them (although there's an argument they only made them to get the iWatch talked about more than your standard ""huh, Apple are making a watch, that's cool, what's on the other channel?"").

&gt; My problem with the idea that the stakes are spending life in Guantanamo is that Assange was perfectly happy to trust the UK legal system, where there have been controversial incidents with extraditions to America, yet find a problem with Sweden...

Lets take a closer look at some of the recent extradition cases between the US and UK; Gary McKinnon; extradition planned, becomes politically hot issue, extradition cancelled. Same for Richard O'Dwyer. Neither faced prospect of torture in the first place. Then you look at those that you might expect it is a risk; the terrorism related suspects eg Abu Hamza, Khaled al Fawwaz, Babar Ahmad, Adel Abdul Bary and Syed Ahsan. Legal battles lasted 8-14 years, extradition followed but required guarantees they would be tried in federal civilian court and not head to Guantanamo. These were people pretty unpopular with the UK population, Hamza especially was a political embarrassment that we couldn't get rid of him, but it still took 8 years.

With a case like Assange's; which is both politically sensitive as well as there being a **very** strong case to be made that he could face torture (given that is *exactly* what we know is happening to Manning, for his leaking to Wikileaks), you have to think extradition would at worst take years and require the same guarantees of a civilian trial and no torture.. (you have to question would the US even *want* to try him in civilian courts when they could get him elsewhere and avoid this issue).

So Sweden; again you look at the Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery case I linked, they were deported extra-judicially the same day by US agents to face expected torture. That is a *very* different situation to what the UK has done. Such an example rather makes a farce of the idea that he would be safe in Sweden because the UK would also have to agree to his extradition from Sweden. I have to say I've become more informed during this conversation and I leave it without any doubt that Assange's reasoning is justifiable.",null,0,null,1426273325,null,0,false,0,cpdxrfi,null,t3_2ywcu2,null,t1_cpdxrfi,null,t1_cpdv68b,null,null,null,1427743580,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Are you looking to remortgage with your existing lender or with a different lender? If it's with a new lender, then they will almost certainly instruct a surveyor of their choice to value the property. You may or may not be charged for this, depending on which lender you are applying for a mortgage from.

If you are dealing with your existing lender and just moving onto a new deal with them, it's possible that they will just index up the value of the property since the last time it was valued for your original mortgage with that lender. This won't necessarily be the case 100% of the time, though - sometimes they will want the property to be re-valued.

Obviously, if a surveyor visits your property and values it, they won't necessarily value it based on the Nationwide or Halifax House Price Index - the valuation will depend on a variety of factors relating to your house itself.

If the valuation arrived at (whether by a surveyor or by calculation based on the regional House Price Index) is such that your LTV is more than 65%, you won't receive a mortgage offer for the 65% product, but it is likely that you would be able to proceed on the 70% product, for example - in this case, they wouldn't necessarily be 'rejecting' your application.

As an example of what might happen if your house is 'down-valued', [here](http://www.accordmortgages.com/literature-information/fees-charges/down-valuations/) is the policy for Accord, the broker arm of the Yorkshire Building Society. Your lender may have a different policy, however.

&gt; Both of those were found to be illegal, yet I don't see any executives in jail for doing that.

&gt; The companies in question got fines, but where's the jail time? The fines they got were dwarfed by the profits of years of illegal activities.

null,false,GreasedTea,null,null,null,"I did actually attend a boarding school from 12-18, so my experience probably has some things in common with what you're imagining. If by 'government schools' you mean state schools, though (what they call 'public school' in the US I believe), it's fairly rare for them to be like that- the perception you've described is usually closer to our private and public schools, but as mine was both state and boarding I have a bit of insight into both sides of the coin I think. :) 

&gt; Strict full suit-and-tie dress code

Our uniform was pretty strict- we had to wear blazers at all times unless it was hot, tucked in shirts, ties with house colours etc. Nothing hugely fancy but they enforced it quite rigorously. I continued at my school for 6th form too and while we didn't have a uniform, we did have to dress quite formally (which was a pain in the arse).

&gt; Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

At my school there were 4 main school houses for years 8-11, one house for year 7 students and another for 6th formers, although in the latter two you were still technically a member of your main school house. We weren't separated in classes though, just in terms of boarding houses.

&gt; There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

Each house at our school had two common rooms, a prep room, and a kitchen (plus our own refectory in the 6th form house), but day students were allowed in all of them.

&gt; There is a captain/prefect for each house

I *think* this was the case, but can't remember for sure.

&gt; Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)

Yep. I was never into sport though so had no clue who they were!

&gt; There are many inter-house competitions.

There were some, mostly based on sporting wins and collective merit points.

&gt; There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school.

Definitely the case at our place, although again I never really knew or cared who they were. They were always 6th formers as far as I can remember.

&gt; ""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")

We had 'double' classes a lot in the sense that we'd spend two hours in a particular class rather than one (usually Friday afternoons or Saturday mornings, UGH), but as our lessons weren't separated by houses the other bit didn't apply.

&gt; Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin

I would have actually quite liked this to be the case! There were optional Latin clubs and we studied Greek plays in A-Level Drama, but nothing dedicated on the curriculum. It tends to be public and private schools that do that here, whereas my school was state.

&gt; Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.

We had a school song that no-one really gave a shit about and couldn't remember the tune to (I doubt even the Principal could have sung the melody correctly, that's how unmemorable that song was), and had chapel instead of assembly on Tuesdays and then on Sundays for the boarders (despite supposedly being a non-denominational school...), but that's about it for the really involved traditional stuff. 

&gt; Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils 

Not really, again that seems to be generally more of a public school thing.

&gt; In-depth study of European and British history from the Byzantine Empire up to about 1945 or so

We did study a lot of that kind of stuff, but also looked a bit at general world history (for example the Vietnam War which I found really interesting). I think our history focus was pretty typical for state schools at that time, mainly wars/communism/revolutions and so on.

The ability to grind out results, while taxing to watch, is a necessary quality of a great team and I don't mind it in the least. In addition, we have the type of players who can still score off the counter after we have been sitting back. The problem, as I see it, is not that we go into a defensive shell to see out a game, rather that we have not been effective enough when we were attacking. We have attacking players who are considered among the best in the world, and we constantly struggle to create actual goal scoring chances from open play. We constantly struggle to get the second or third goal to kill off the game - even when we are still in our attacking, high press mode. Our attack appears to lack any real plan. Sure, we constantly maintain good attacking possession, but there is rarely an end product after several minutes of build up (or even an attempt for that matter). We have a tendency to walk the ball around the corners of the box without looking for goal or putting dangerous balls across the box. There also doesn't ever appear to be any creative movement off the ball (aside from overlaps down the wing) - a result of our central midfielders rarely attacking the box. Aside from when Hazard has the ball at his feet we usually don't look very threatening with attacking possession. However, these are easy things to adjust with a little bit of work. To get back on topic, I guess i would say that I believe we have the type of team/players that can be successful at both sides of the game. I just feel that we need to start focusing on build up play, creating chances and finishing. I think we do well enough at the defensive end that we can now start to expand our style of play. We have midfield players who can shoot. I think a little encouragement is all it would take to get them to pick their heads up and look for it.

What does make it particularly difficult in London though is that prices are already obscenely high, which is self-reinforcing with the help of oil sheiks using London housing as a reserve currency and often leaving them empty. As Tottenham is one of the very few areas not to have become 'gentrified', and with relatively low prices, this development could have a big impact on the local economy and force renters away.

Places of work do fear sacking minorities for legitimate reasons in case it legally comes back on them and they get sued. The worst example I've seen, anecdotal it may be, is a MtF school teacher not being anywhere near up to scratch and insisting she'd sue if she got the sack because it was obviously discrimination. The truth is she was just extremely bad at her job but got away with things others would be sacked for no problem. The school were petrified of sacking her. In the end she quit and went elsewhere. This legislation is being used as a legal weapon to suit those with an agenda on both sides.

null,false,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,null,"&gt; there's nothing all that unreasonable about having a points based immigration system, checks on people going out, and a reasonable overall limit. The problem is that other parties can't support that because it is incompatible with membership of the EU

Almost none of that is correct. The UK does have a points based system. It's large, robust, and has existed since 2008. This UKIP proposal of a points based system makes absolutely no sense. It's like saying Britain should restore the monarchy. It's already there. The EU has nothing to do with the adoption of national immigration policy with respect to non-EU citizens.

Checks on people going out *should* absolutely be reintroduced and should have never been scrapped, but again, this has nothing to do with the EU. In fact quite the opposite. Unlike the entire rest of Europe, the UK and Ireland chose not to join the Schengen Area, and instead created their own Common Travel Area. They jointly decided that, unlike the Schengen Area, they would *not* impose exit checks. By not having exit checks, the UK actually stands apart from the rest of the EU.

A reasonable overall limit is not reasonable within the current framework of EU treaty rights, but I imagine there would be enough support amongst many European countries that a renegotiation of certain treaty rights could be arranged that would place stricter controls on access to benefits, compulsory registration, perhaps even background checks, without eliminating the freedom of movement of people altogether.

I'm on the fence about Martinez, but I do think positivity is still important, just maybe not as much as he slathered on earlier this year and towards the end of last year when the cracks turned into chasms.  And while I do hope that behind closed doors he's pressing the players and not hiding the problems and his frustration, I've never understood the fans desire for being public about it.  Nothing good ever comes from a coach/manager dissing his players or talking shit to the press.  Just creates more attrition and dissent.  And you lose respect.

Fear is the ultimate killer.  Never play not to lose - not at the professional level.  If you do, you micro-manage everything and it makes your tactics easy to counter.  Chelsea is dealing with this right now - Mourinho made them so cautious not to lose that PSG scored two goals with 10 men.   Martinez is young and wants to look good now that he showed some promise last year, but he's got to take chances and instill that mindset back into the squad.  

If the last hour of the Kiev game was any indication, just go at 'em, or like they say in golf, ""Grip it and rip it.""

I'm not really sure what you were actually trying to say here as this devolved into random reviews of episodes.

If Doctor Who doesn't have the same ""kick"" that it used to for you after you have watched 100s of hours of it I'm not really sure if that's a reflection on the show itself so much as something that happens after you spend hundreds of hours watching one show. 

Maybe just take a break and come back to catch up in a year or two when you feel like checking it out again? 

Oh and last thing: I don't think the show is ever going to totally wrap up, I think the Gallifrey returing arc is a natural change for the show after a decade of angst over the time war. I honestly think Moffat just wanted to push in a new direction and the fact that he had a big budget to celebrate the show and character meant that the 50th was a great time to do that. 

Maybe it will take another 5 or 6 years for it to come back. Then the big arc can be rebuilding it. Or dealing with the fallout from that or something else more creative. I suppose if the show has seriously fallen in the ratings they could wrap it up that way but I doubt that they will.

Back to Bale. He is a great player, and loved when he played for us. But Real Madrid supporters are in their right to be critical of him. Real Madrid got robbed when signing him. He is a fantastic player, but should not be the most expensive player in the world.

Furthermore his style of play is selfish, he dives a lot (nobody has been booked more for simulation in PL history, and Bale only played full time for 3 seasons), and to be playing in La Liga he frankly does not score enough.

null,false,SAeN,num15,,null,"1. Bentaleb - No question about this one. He's got an eye for a pass, will shut down opposition attacks before they begin, has a lot of fight in him and well [just look at him](http://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/styles/main-image-landscape/public/pa-22030999.jpg?itok=buIB0SQf)! And looks like he can only get better. Also he's only just turned 20!

2. Paulinho? - Paulinho has been largely hopeless for much of his time here but has gotten on the scoresheet more than once. Problem is that he often lounges about the middle of the park not doing much of anything. If he more consistently made runs off the ball and pulled opposition players out of position he could be great, but as it is he's just not very good. Mason is far more effective in the role Paulinho was expected to play. He was shown up in the WC as well. He'd probably benefit going back to Brazil, or possibly to Italy. He's been linked with both. I definitely don't see his future here.

3.  Capoue/Stambouli - Pretty much the same player, neither of which has been particularly impressive. Well not entirely true, Capoue was one of our better players at the start of the season but was apparently involved in the attempted 'mutiny' against Poch and his training regimen and hasn't been seen since. Unsurprising since Sherwood sidelined him last year as well. Don't see him having a future here if he keeps that attitude. Stambouli is talented, but he's not the midfield controller we need him to be. He's not going to lace in a great pass like [Bentaleb](https://youtu.be/IeKk86csZ-8?t=5m13s). He's as slow as Fazio. And Poch clearly considers him a rotation option. I'm interested to see what another season here gives him but he's got a lot of work to do.

Best, most passionate, turned 20 a few months ago (others are 24/26/26 with Paul and Cap nearly 27). Tackler, can deliver a good ball (cross for Kane's header), more defensive but has been tipped by sherwood to get more goals later. Nailed on starter for the foreseeable future.

&gt;Capoue

Arguably second best from what I've seen in terms of ability, just from Sherwood and now Poch's selections he doesn't work anywhere near hard enough. More of an all rounder, likely to be the first sold. Not a bad player but attitude is very possibly a problem.

&gt;Paulinho

Annoying player, he *could* be good, very good in fact. Likes to make a run beyond/late into the box. Probably has the best ability to score out of all midfielders in the squad on his own (Mason will run him close next season though I feel) but defensively he's a bit lacking. Maybe I'm not paying much attention to him but Bentaleb and Mason both seem to offer more defensively and, while he offers a better goal threat, Mason/Bent also offer more for the front 4 (better passing for example). Drops far too deep and takes the ball off the defender's toes, no need for it. Played well as a #10 v Burnley but he has done ita few times and that's the exception. Second season, second probably to be sold.

&gt;Stambouli

Quite good, passing's okay, can get in tackles but sometimes a bit light in them, his tracking back is also suspect and he can make some errors defensively (tackle timing) a bit more than the others. Quite skillful, confident on the ball and doesn't mind taking it forward. First season so he'll probably stay for next year.

Once you start watching you'll see a lot of little things that tie into the new show and get to see how much Tom Baker's portrayal influenced the whole thing.

""Key"" Episodes for the revived series I like from this era are: Sontaran Experiment, Genesis, Brain of Morbius, Deadly Assassin, Underworld, and Invasion of Time.

Damp is a very characteristic smell, so pay attention to smells. Also, pay note to the weather conditions - if it's been raining heavily and you can smell it then there's a good chance there could be issues on the external of the house (leaks through roof areas). 

Look for any evidence of it, obviously. I'd look closely to the lower and upper corners, and near windows, to see if it looks like they've added extra paint layers (to cover things up). I've found external walls are the worst for it. Just ask yourself if an area looks like it might be poorly ventilated too (like utility rooms with washers/driers that are far too small with no extraction, for instance). Around the windows can be very common. 

Speak to current tenants if possible. Definitely don't be afraid to grill the landlord/letting agent (whoever is showing you around) over it.

What made you think he would be playing as a CAM, if we ever sign him? Has Pogba ever played a playmaker? There is no doubt he would be a great addition to any team in the world. And i think he is most likely the only midfielder that would have propelled our midfield into a powerhouse. But, these overreactions needs to stop. Has Oscar been that poor this season? Or are you just trying to point fingers after PSG humiliation? Everyone is acting as if we have been really poor this season. Even some deluded Arsenal fans on /r/Soccer are convinced they have been playing better than us. Pogba would have been best utilized in a 3 man midfield. Most likely, consisting of Matic and Oscar. 3 man midfield needs a player like Oscar. Great work rate, strong in defense and has the ability to create and score goals by himself. Fabregas doesn't have the legs to run around and he is a liability in protecting the back four. EPL is not Serie A. In EPL, he would be rushed and overcrowded, if he were to play from deep in just 3 man midfield. Don't just expect him to play like Pirlo in unfamiliar position that he is just getting accustomed to. If you want us to move him further up the pitch to accommodate Pogba then it would be pointless. Because, he has been playing really well in his current position with our usual formation. We looked really good for the vast majority of the season. At the moment, we need to keep what we have and only add. This sub likes underrating our own players(just look what they keep on posting after our players move on and they start performing well). Oscar is a superb player and he will surely be one of the very best midfielders in the world in the near future. To get better, we should always keep our best players. What is the point of letting go one of the best young upcoming midfielders, if you are trying to build a team for the future? Jose always keeps the foundation intact. He has already started it when he let go instrumental player like Mata for Oscar. He sees something in him. And you should probably watch him closely. Also watch other players in his position that you think are better than him. Instead of just watching YouTube highlights and thinking they are much better than the ones we have. There was a poster here that was going crazy about Nicolás Gaitán few years ago saying he would be among the very best and we should sign him. Looked where he still is now(no disrespect to Benfica, but there are other bigger teams in Europe). 

tl;dr : Keep a player like Oscar and go after the signatures of players like Pogba. We should stop underrating our own players. We should also stop this overreactions.

But the search engine algorithm (i.e., the valuable part of Google) was designed in SF. They have all sorts of highly paid engineers working on this in the US. Shouldn't the UK company have to pay for the use of this algorithm? If the UK denied a royalty expense for the use of the IP (and somehow the US didn't force the US corporation to pick up royalty income), you would have relatively less profit in the US company (underpaying US tax) and relatively higher profit in the UK company (overpaying UK tax).  

The bigger issue here is the ability for corporations to sell IP to tax ""friendly"" jurisdictions. Perhaps the ability to sell IP to related parties cross borders should be denied. This would need to be tackled at an international level.

I also support the idea that the job of a government is to help the native population. I also agree that laws that say you can't discriminate against immigrant workers are bad.

But I do heavily disagree with him saying it should be okay to discriminate based on **race**. He seems to think nowadays, we don't need this legislation because we're not racist anymore, which is naive.

To be honest, I'm really hoping he got confused, and that he'll clarify his position in the coming days. Actually, I've just read that he's clarified his position and said this: ""I have made comments in favour of British people getting jobs over and above those from southern eastern Europe."" The UKIP leader said he was speaking up for Britain's unemployed youth ""both black and white"", saying the young black community had suffered the biggest rise in unemployment as a result of immigration. This is much more in line with what Farage has always advocated, and is something I agree with.

When I read this:

 It makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin.
There are four main types of racial discrimination: direct, indirect, victimisation and harassment.
**Positive action is only allowed if a particular racial group suffers a disadvantage, is disproportionately under represented or has needs that are different from those of other racial groups in the workforce**

I think Fuck That. Farage is proposing that Positive Action should be allowed to allow businesses to choose to hire British-born people over immigrants. At the moment it's allowed for everybody **other** than british-born people, as long as they aren't sufficiently 'represented.' If Farage wanted to alter that part of the Act, I'd support him in doing so. I hate the way every group needs to be suffiently represented in politics and business. This is equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.

Wondered what the hell you were about, Googled it, presumably it's policies EC660-EC679 http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html

It starts off 

&gt; Practical decentralisation of banking and monetary policy

Then goes on to describe massive regulation and centralisation of the banking and monetary system.

Jesus that is financially illiterate. Do they deliberately want to destroy the economy? Drastically shrinking the money supply will have massively damaging effects. What they are effecticely proposing is nationalising all the banks (i.e. robbing everyone's savings and investments, since a good chunk of people's pensions funds are tied up in banking and finance). And of course since

&gt; Banks should be required to limit their role to taking deposits and making loans that facilitate economic activity.

there won't be any way for people to invest for their retirement.

&gt; The 1844 Bank Charter Act will be updated to prohibit banks from creating national currency in the form of electronic credit. 

And how do they propose that banks do anything? Creating money by lending pretty much defines what a bank does, if it doesn't do that it's not a bank, it's a deposit box.

&gt; The NMA will be mandated by law to manage the stock of national currency so that it is sufficient to support full employment,

That will be difficult since 50% of people in the south east will now be unemployed

&gt; while avoiding general inflation in price

That should be easy since the policies are massively deflationary

&gt; Any new money created by the NMA will be credited to the account of the Government as additional revenue, to be spent into circulation in the economy in accordance with the budget approved by Parliament

apart from that statement which may cause hyperinflation since the government will be tempted to print money due to the massively shrunken tax base.

I agree that the banks have not been sufficiently regulated, and that reforms of needed. Some of the ones in this policy document do make sense, but the general gist of things as described is clearly bananas.

Their opinions were easily swayed by the media and those deluded cunts on /r/Soccer. They were acting as if this loss was one of our worst defeats in history. Bashing Jose tactics. This and that. Everyone one of them thought they knew why we lost. All the top teams had two or 3 really bad matches like us.  No formation or tactics could have saved us from getting knocked out. If players play poor, people are quick to blame the manager's formation and tactics. How about blaming the players for not executing it? Our players were just rubbish and we are so unlucky that this one happened in one of the biggest stage in front of our fans. There have been countless matches that we felt more pain than this. To be honest, i was just disappointed. I wasn't in pain or anything. By country miles, we are still the best team in the League. We are top of the league. And we still have a chance of winning more trophies than any other team in the League.

We don’t like seeing ticket touting, because we don’t like to rip off our own. Our fans don’t tolerate racism at Anfield; the Munich chants of the bad old days are banished. All that is part of what makes Liverpool FC one of the truly global clubs; we attract fans from all over the world. It’s something to be proud of.

&gt; The UKIP argument is to leave the EU and apply the [points based immigration system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points-based_immigration_system_%28United_Kingdom%29) to everyone, EU nationals included

But this is the whole problem, because that's not entirely what they say. They want to introduce a points based system *in the first place*.

* The only mention [on this page](http://www.ukip.org/issues) is ""A points-based visa system and time-limited work permits.""

* [This page](http://www.ukip.org/ukip_launches_immigration_policy) gives a little more detail: ""UKIP plans to establish a visa system based on the Australian points based system."" This already exists, and has done for seven years now. I'll take the rest of this stuff in turn:

&gt; ""And UKIP plans a ‘Highly Skilled Workers’ only work visa, providing the opportunity for permanent leave to remain.""

This already exists. It's called a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) visa, except right now it doesn't even provide permanent leave to remain. This would actually relax and expand the scope of the current merit-based Tier 1 visas.

&gt; ""We’d have five tiers for visas""

Coincidentally, the current visa system has... five tiers of visas!

&gt; ""These include the Highly Skilled Work Visa, the Temporary Unskilled Workers Visa, Visitors Passes, the Student visa, and the Family Reunion visa.""

Again, this is actually looser and less defined than the system right now. Currently, Tier 1 is for either exceptional talent or very rich investors. Tier 2 is a temporary skilled work permit. Tier 3, which has never been used, is a temporary unskilled work permit, Tier 4 is student visas, and Tier 5 are various short term things like working holiday visas and a few government-run schemes.

Tourism and family visas currently fall outside the points-based system, and I cannot understand the logic of actually folding them into the current existing five tiers, except if you're trying to split hairs to sell the general public something that already exists.

&gt; ""UKIP will offer no amnesty on illegal immigration.""

Well they don't have to. The only route to amnesty, a previous 14-year 'long stay' visa, was abolished by the coalition government several years ago. So that's a promise already kept before even assuming office.

&gt; ""Save for current applications and Highly Skilled Workers, approved asylum and family reunion, there will be no permanent leave to remain permitted outside of the new policy rules""

This is already the case. Except for current Tier 1 and Tier 2 (highly skilled) and family visas (like spouses), no other visas count as a qualifying period for permanent residency, otherwise known as indefinite leave to remain or ILR. 

&gt; ""Existing EU citizens will be offered the opportunity to seek permanent right to reside and citizenship in the UK when Britain leaves the European Union""

That's more generous than now! Right now, you have to wait for five years first.

&gt; ""Criminals will lose the right of citizenship""

That already happens

&gt; ""And we would remove the passports of those who choose to fight alongside terrorist organisations.""

I don't object to this, although it may well be illegal under international law which is why no other governments have implemented this policy yet despite saying they intended to. Governments have the responsibility to not render someone stateless. It sucks but that's the way it is.

&gt; ""UKIP says that all Highly Skilled Persons will be required to have Health Insurance for 5 years.""

The Tories have already proposed basically the same thing. I say fuck right off. If I pay NI contributions, I'm using the NHS. 

&gt; ""UKIP says that all immigrants under the new, Australian-style points system will have to make tax and national insurance contributions for five consecutive years before claiming UK benefits.""

See above. Also, almost all immigrants are not able to claim benefits under most visas. Typically, EU migrants *can*, but there are various restrictions and time limits involved that are quite confusing and difficult to enforce. For non-EU migrants, only asylum seekers and spouses of British citizens are allowed to claim *some benefits*. Virtually all other visas will have ""NO RECOURSE TO PUBLIC FUNDS"" stamped inside them.

Everything on that page is just a rehash or reformulation of current policy as it exists today. The only major different that actually means something is this:

&gt; ""UKIP plans to abolish rules discriminating against non-EU citizens, in favour of EU citizens.""

That's it. All of these other proposed systems and ideas and tiered visas are exactly what we have today. In fact, they could form a government and immediately announce that 80% of the immigration policies in their manifesto have already been delivered on Day 1.

The issue I was responding to that /u/JB_UK brought up is that he said:

&gt; points based immigration system, checks on people going out, and a reasonable overall limit. The problem is that **other parties can't support that because it is incompatible with membership of the EU**

This was the issue. I never said that UKIP didn't want to apply what are the *current* rules, not their proposed ideas which are indistinguishable from current rules, on EU citizens as well. The problem was the idea that they were going to create a points based system that doesn't exist and reintroduce exit checks, *which would otherwise not be allowed by Europe*. This is untrue. Only his last point of introducing a 'reasonable overall limit' is true that that would not be allowed under current European rules. However, I see nowhere where UKIP want to introduce a limit on EU workers. A cap already exists for non-EU citizens and has done so since around 2010 (and incidentally has never actually been hit). The UKIP suggestion seems to be to place EU citizens inside what is effectively the same mechanism that exists now, just perhaps with a slightly higher limit. None of this is new.

This is the whole problem. Voters are being hoodwinked by Farage into thinking he's selling a new, different solution, when the only thing on offer is to leave the EU and basically apply the exact same rules on Europeans as well. That's it. There are no grand new flagship immigration systems being offered, no change in some of the serious flaws in the existing non-EU points based system, none of that. 

People need to bear this in mind carefully. If that's all it takes - fewer EU citizens - to vote for a party that would take care of all matters of defence, education policy, economic and fiscal policy, foreign relations, and all the other arguably far more important things that governments do, then that's quite sad. UKIP are being intellectually dishonest about their immigration policy, and this isn't just me. I'm not the first to notice. [This article explains](http://www.workpermit.com/news/2014-07-17/ukip-proposes-uk) the problem with what Farage is saying and then explains the current system much more thoroughly than I have here. Here's the beginning:

&gt; On 8th July, Mr Farage told the London talk radio station LBC Radio 'The Aussies have a points system and they say to come to Australia you must be under 45 years of age, you must have a skill or a trade that will bring a benefit to our country'.

&gt; The interesting thing about Mr Farage's policy, if it can be called that, is that the UK already has such a system. It is not identical to the Australian system and it is in many ways much more restrictive but migrants coming to the UK for work have already had to pass points-based tests since 2008.

I personally think its a common hold out tactic used by many professionals to get at least on the higher spectrum of what they want on their contract, Raheem knows his talent and worth to other teams and is applying pressure to assure he gets paid what he wants, its football, he most likely will not go unless FSG really blow the contract talks and want to force it to be heavily incentive based.",null,0,null,1426308636,null,0,false,0,cpeff0t,null,t3_2yzk1r,null,t1_cpeff0t,null,t3_2yzk1r,null,null,null,1427753503,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

The bottom line for me is that a cash ISA offers a no hassle no strings way of dumping a large amount of cash into savings. And that is worth the slight hit on interest.

Real life example of the hassle that makes it not worth it for me: I do actually keep some money in my current account because it offers in credit interest. But this month my pay didn't come in until after the month end. This meant that I hadn't paid in enough during that calendar month, so I missed out on the interest, netting 0% for that month.

Also the interest is paid monthly, meaning that if I want to actually save that money I have to xfer my interest into the cash isa every month, otherwise the monthy interest doesn't get any interest (assuming I'm at the cap) and I also run the risk of not saving the interest at all as it's just in my current account.",null,0,null,1426314920,null,0,1426315632,0,cpehdcl,null,t3_2yw4zd,null,t1_cpehdcl,null,t1_cpe0xrc,null,null,null,1427754414,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

The point is that allowing the money supply to constantly increase as happens currently massively distorts the economy and creates far worse outcomes than an alternative system would.

That money doesn't exist. It is just numbers on a piece of paper, figures on a database. 

&gt;there won't be any way for people to invest for their retirement.

So what do you think people where doing before private banks where given a free reign to do this?

Britain wants to have a discussion about litter - when smokers are still so arrogant and brazen as to discard rubbish in front of their office of employment, in front of rail stations, in front of schools?

Don't make me laugh. This country couldn't give a *fuck* about litter. It doesn't pretend to care.

Councils, even with laws on littering and smoking bans, do almost zero about it. In fact - when they *do* prosecute somebody for discarding a cigarette butt it makes the *national news*.

I’m not that gullible.

Oh, another gem from the same paper - the studies which claim 50:50 equality ignore sexual assault. So if your partner rapes you, it doesn’t show up in their statistics!

To start with you might want to focus on passive investments that will give you slightly higher rewards than holding cash in exchange for a little more risk. Take a look at index tracker funds that will give you exposure to a pool of stocks, smoothing out a lot of the day-to-day swings of individual companies. Government bond funds can augment the risk of stock market exposure for when things go south. The Boglehead's Guide to Investing is a fairly good introduction to passive investments. 

If the £15k is all you have, then keeping enough in an easily liquidated instrument (ideally cash) for an emergency is something to be mindful of. You do get rewarded for risk, but I'd be careful about using riskier instruments with any substantial amount of my wealth. The closer you are to speculating/gambling, the less you should allocate ideally.

With the crowdfunding things, I'm not sure I see it the same way. To me, investing in a portfolio of well-established companies (e.g. XASX) is a lot more risk-averse than staking a sizeable chunk of net worth in a company with no track record. I'd be cautious about investing in a single company in the FTSE100, let alone a startup.

For even higher risk exposure, you can use CFDs for aggressively leveraged trading, but that's typically an efficient way to lose all your money plus some.

In your shoes, I'd:

 1. Put at least 6 months wages in a high-interest cash savings account/ISA
 2. Put the rest in index funds with a mix of bonds to reflect your age (80% equity, 20% bond)
 3. Maybe take a couple of punts on stock picks with money I'd be absolutely fine with losing
 4. Wait until I was worth £100k+ before looking at crowd-funded VC stuff

“I think Tottenham will be pleased that he is coming to play league football and it’s a great signing for us.”

He added: “He’ll go straight into the squad for tomorrow’s game and we’ll go from there.

There is an election whereby you can jointly elect to have all the income/benefits of the property taxable on you but this will mean any gain you eventually make on the sale of the property will be taxable on you as well. This isn't advisable as both you and your wife have a CGT annual exemption to set against gains. Two exemptions are better than one.

Your wife being American shouldn't complicate anything dramatically. On the assumption that she is resident in the UK anyway.

The best thing to do if you're not sure is to talk to a local tax adviser/accountant. Everything I've said above is pretty general and may not correlate directly with your situation so it's best to talk to someone who can advise you properly, I'm happy to recommend some firms if you'd like.

I would also stress that having a tax adviser help you with your rental property accounts will almost always help you save tax on the profits as they will be able to advise on the most beneficial claims and elections to make i.e. wear and tear, rent a room, FHL etc.

This is a fundamental problem of devolution.  Centralised services like Policing, Health, Education and Public Transport *will always* cost more in rural areas.   The UK budget should account for this, and not assume that the costs should be similar to those in London or it's leafy suburbs.

The troubles were caused by failure of British policy (not absolving the republicans of guilt here, but the level of civil unrest can only be seen as failure of government to address the needs of all of it's people).  It will cost more for the foreseeable future to deal with the fallout.  The budget should account for this.   

Public sector workers have not had a single pay rise since the crash and have effectively had a significant loss in living standards and their pensions have been significantly reduced.   I understand the reasons for the strike, and even as a moderately conservative minded person I'd have a degree of sympathy with their goals.

We do need a significant investment in NI from the UK to help rebuild our country.   When the UK government reduces the block grant in response to an effort to provide stimulus (reducing the corporate tax rate) it's only causing more misery here and is not working with us to help out our province, no matter how often they come on the BBC with their plummy accents and talk down to us. 

 I can accept that if the stimulus works, then in 10 years or so it could be cause for review, but to expect what is a small, rural, divided, and let's be honest - backward - province to shoulder the burden is just plain bad policy.

Are you *sure* that you are not at least partially responsible? After all, *you* are the one common factor between all those houses.

Ventilation really is hugely important. I lived in my house for 15 years without suffering from more than a tiny smattering of mould in the bathroom. A couple of years ago, we moved away from the area and let out our house - *bang* mould problems. I can only assume that the tenants really like long baths &amp; showers. I suspect they may have turned off the extractor fan - it is quite noisy, and not very conducive to relaxing bathing.

I've nuked the bathroom with mould killer, repainted it with fungicidal paint, and turned the ventilator's humidity sensitivity way up. What else can the landlord do?

The Council cut back on emptying the litter bins on the street, so it's common to see them overflowing in busy areas. Recently they have began replacing them with larger, metal bins though. 

Business waste collection became open to private companies, some of which really don't give a shit. Some come round at odd times so there's rubbish bags out on the street for a long time. Some of the businesses which do have proper bins, the employees come to dump bags in and don't bother closing the lid so seagulls have a party in there. We get loads of seagulls in summer, they are complete shits. Some tenement areas do not have communal bins so you put black bags out on the street on collection day, the seagulls just rip open the bags and empty it all over the street for the wind to blow around.

Well then we need to look at the big picture and ask ourselves why house prices are spiralling out of control in the first place ( especially in London which has a knock-on effect over the rest of the country  ) and what needs to be done to stop that. 

One massive problem for starters is the flow of foreign cash ( a lot of it crooked  ) coming into this country though tax havens and buying up property like it's going out of fashion. It may be good short term for the few but in reality all it's doing is increasing the inequality gap, making it impossible for the average working man to buy a roof over their head and restricting economic growth in the process. 

And as long as London is being used as a warehouse for laundering the worlds dirty cash then this problem will not go away, has no solution and will only get worse. We need politicians who will address and fix this problem, not bolster it for the benefit of themselves and their cronies. In fact politicians whose ideology and policy is focused entirely on closing our ever expanding inequality gap.

Ideally this would be the start of a long-period DIY investor life. I don't pretend to quit my job and just do this, I see it more as an aid for my monthly payroll. I do know there will be periods where I'll be losing money, so that's fine.
I'll have a look at passive investment strategies, government bond funds, etc.

£15K is all I have for now, so yeah I may be looking to invest £10K out of those £15K just in case.

I know the equity crowdfunding stuff is high risk, but I just wanted to invest a very small amount of those £10K or whatever in high risk investment, which I'll probably lose, but it should be fine. My idea is to diversify my investments as much as possible.

Most of the stuff you've mentioned (CFDs, FTSE100,etc) I don't even know what it means.. :D, so as I said, I'll do some reading to familiarise myself with all these technicisms. (Any feedback in those books I mentioned before?).

Sterling is contracted until Summer 2017, I believe. We should start to panic if he hasn't signed a new one by this time next year.

Everything else is bullshit.

Sterling (and his agent) would like to be making more money than currently. However, as his star continues to rise, the salary he can ask for on a new contract increases. The more important he is to the club, the more he can ask for. But if he has a dip in form or other players eclipse him, maybe he won't be able to ask for as much. They have an interesting game to play there.

Other agendas to be settled: newspapers and blogs need sensation headlines to generate page impressions. The club needs to ""send messages"" to fans, their own players and potential new signings that they are determined to hold on to top players and be successful, but also to other clubs and agents that they're not going to be taken advantage of and aren't just throwing money around.

No argument when it comes to the convenience of cash ISAs over current account interest. But that convenience comes at a cost.

But let's use £20k of savings as an example. £5k in Lloyd's current account pays around £13 a month. £2k in TSB pays around £6.50 a month. The remaining £13k in Santander pays around £23.50 a month after the monthly fee. That's £43 paid monthly, and £516 a year.

According to money saving expert, the best easy access cash ISA rate is 1.5%, which would pay £300 pa. That's £216 less (42% less) interest pa. By no means is that a slight hit. You'd need an interest rate of around 2.6% in an ISA to get the same level of interest as current accounts, and that account might not give you easy access or even let you pay £20k in one go.

The interest in this example does get interest if it's transferred to Santander. 

Is this for everyone? No. Do I do it? No, I collect the £13 a month from Lloyd's and keep the rest of my savings in a S&amp;S ISA.",null,0,null,1426330914,null,0,false,0,cpekjrb,null,t3_2yw4zd,null,t1_cpekjrb,null,t1_cpehdcl,null,null,null,1427755967,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

It then checks if the vehicle is taxed.

It doesn't check who the registered owner is, because it's not 'that' relevant. And unless you put your driving licence number on your V5, then there is no direct connection that it's you. You'd get out of that in a matter of minutes in a court. Police can get it from DVLA though.

First of all, given all the recent jingoistic commemorations of the Great War, you'd think there'd be some allusion to the success of the European project to thank for the peace we've had in Western Europe since the end of WWII.

Freedom of movement working both ways: I just went and worked in Germany for six months. It was bloody brilliant. And all I needed to do was pop down to the local authority, and spend 2 minutes showing my passport and getting a little certificate, the same when I left.

Erasmus sending students here there and everywhere is testament to this: learn more about someone's ""foreign"" culture, and you'll realise how similar you really are. If you see Johnny Foreigner really isn't there to steal your jobs, and has exactly the same hopes, dreams, and fears as you, you're less likely to demonise him.

It's sad to say but a lot of us are ""Little Englanders"". We think our green isle is the last bastion of rational thinking and pinnacle of civilisation, when in fact Europe is a pretty comparably progressive place, and we aren't the dog's bollocks, much to our chagrin. Send us all abroad to see other cultures, and make each of us do some volunteering in impoverished communities.

""Accumulating"" don't distribute their profits (they're reflected in the NAV or price of the fund instead) so you'd have to sell periodically, or use ""distributing"" funds to get a regular-ish income. That said, on £10k, you're not looking at a great boost to your income (about £1600 a year based on today's 1-year performance of a LifeStrategy 100 fund, or about £520 a year based on [historic returns](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/UK_asset_class_returns)).

Unfortunately, investing isn't a money printing machine (unless you run a hedge fund). In reality you should see it more like a bank account that pays better interest but might lose you money.

I should point out that if you have a pension scheme then you should be paying into it. If your employer matches your contribution, then that's a profit you make instantly each time you pay in, and near-impossible to beat.

It's your choice if you want to invest in crowdfunding, but I still wouldn't cause it diversifying. Would you say I'd be diversifying if I added a £100 accumulator on 10000-1 odds to my passive £9k portfolio? I don't think I would. It's your choice, though, but personally I'd see that as gambling. Diversification comes from ""minimising your maximum regret"" by ensuring you aren't disproportionately exposed to risk. For example, if you bought shares in BP and Shell, you're diversifying on corporate issues (e.g. BP has an oopsie and spills oil everywhere) but you're still exposed to the risk of oil prices tumbling.

Looking at those books, I'm not sure they're worth 0.4% of your funds to be honest. The first seems to be more of a glossary that you can probably get by googling and reading Investopedia. The second seems to be much of the same. The [Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/UK_investing) article on UK investing will probably tell you a lot of what's in that book.

To put things in perspective, it could cost you up to £15 or so for a single trade in commission for ETFs or shares, depending on your broker. If you can get the knowledge elsewhere for free then it's probably not worth it. There is a lot to take in, and I'd advise doing that before going in anywhere with real money.

I'm not as crazy as my previous post might have suggested, I was just illustrating the logic behind it.

I do dislike quotas, and ""Liberation officers"", especially rampant in student politics, to represent underrepresented minorities. The thing I always wondered was: why, if women are the majority in higher education, do they have a minority officer, and men not? Furthermore I feel it's divisive in saying they are a minority, not simply a part of the student body, who just happen to have slightly different skin or whatever. The same with labelling ""people of colour"". That's just saying you're different from white people, and that white people have no colour.

I'd be inclined to reverse the old anti-racism poem:

&gt;When you're born, you're black.  
When you grow up, you're black.  
When you go in the sun, you're black.    
When you're scared, you're black.  
When you're sick, you're black.  
And when you die, you're still black.  

&gt;And we white people.  
When we're born, we're pink.  
When we grow up, we're white.  
When we go in the sun, we're red.  
When we're cold, we're blue.
