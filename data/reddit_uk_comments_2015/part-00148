I think Rodgers could have a genuine crack at winning the big stuff, the leagues and European trophies if he had more time. Rodgers needs to learn about being a winner, and what works and doesn't. That's the difference between him and say Simeone. Simeone had the winning mentality as a player, he knows how he should act, motivate and work. When to go beserk and when to be calm. He learnt that from being a player. That's why this FA Cup was so important, Rodgers could've had a go at winning a trophy but for the second time, we've fallen at the final hurdle. 

The most important thing for Rodgers is to win something. He needs that moment, needs to understand. At Wolfsburg and Milan, he could have a good go, especially if Bayern and Juventus struggle. Then he could have a shot at the league and other cups.  It's easier to win trophies there, especially with big clubs such as Milan and Wolfsburg then at Liverpool. Rodgers hasn't won anything, he will do eventually, but it'll be lingering in the back of his mind that a succesfull manager is based on what he has won, and he has won zilch.

Every pundit wants us to be happy at staying a mid-table club forever. Recently I've heard a lot about our situation and not once have I heard a possible reason being that we want to push onto the next level and show some ambition just like Swansea have been doing the last few years and Southampton are doing with the managerial changes they've had in the last 2 seasons.
We have a great team, money to spend on new players, as well as some good youth prospects and on top of all that we are moving into a new stadium at the end of next season which seems to get overlooked.


I think the major problem with us right now is that there's nothing to play for anymore which is an obvious motivational problem. Our players are already on holiday and thinking about next season.

&gt;'The players don't need to impress Allardyce'
When a team of players know the manager might not be in charge for the longer term, then it is harder to motivate the group. They don't need to impress you. 

Jason Roberts is absolutely right by saying this. I think Sam knows his time is up and the players know it too.

I could just as easily say ""If there is a 0% turnout it will be clear to everyone that there is a problem with the political system""...That's not realistic, and doesn't solve the problem. A spoilt vote expresses dissatisfaction with the choices on offer, not the system of voting.

&gt;Because the number of spoilt ballots is low.

My point was that non-voters *are* counted. Right now we have one large group that doesn't view it as being worth even participating for whatever reasons and it's seen as a legitimate problem by politicians. I don't see how dividing that group would help.

&gt;Then write ""I WANT PR"" or whatever on your ballot paper. Or find another way to campaign for change. You clearly don't feel strongly about it if you can't be arsed to do anything.

Again, that contributes to turnout figures and does more to perpetuate FPTP than end it. Also, how do you know I *don't* do other things to campaign for change? I agree that it's important we realize that there are things we can do other than voting which have a much larger impact.

Also, yes, I have a sense of entitlement. I feel entitled to due representation and my vote will not only not provide that, but if anything help delay it, which seems to be the point you missed. I'm not ""not-voting"" just because I don't feel I'll get due representation, I'm not voting because I feel voting will be *actively detrimental* to the pursuit of voting reform and proper democracy.

Just imagine Rafa under John henry and Tom werner, I am not building castles in the air but we were a killer team under Rafa for five seasons and under Brendao its been one good season last year because we were without Europe and were out of most of the cup competitions resulting in us having less games to play and hence the lack of rotation. This season though, we had to play in multiple cup competition and the players were asked to do a lot and look were we're? 5th place is the best we could do with this squad so no point in blaming Brendausaur. But when it comes to tactics and making key substitutions Rafa was one of the best in the world at his time. When nothing is going in your favor Rafa makes changes, he freaking makes a move, does something unlike Brendan. Rafa won't send in players at the 90th minute to make a difference.

null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"&gt; The hilarious thing is that there were never actually any popular conspiracies about the NSA that were even close to the revelations of Snowdon.

Yes there were, in fact most of it had been hinted on for years in terms of overall ability, just not specific details &amp; program names. There were bits and pieces out there e.g. the ability to tap undersea cables, and things like Carnivore to capture and archive data from persons of interest. 

This wasn't exactly conspiritard fodder either, the best sources come from things like official EU Parliament reports and so on, one 2001 report for example covers the arrangements between ""Five Eyes"" along with details of the sites in use (e.g. Menworth Hill) along with actual known instances of industrial espionage using these systems. Mostly trade negotiations, a stolen few patients now and then. Old old news. 

Snowden just filled in the blanks. For example it was known they *could* keep a record of someone's web browsing, what wasn't known that they are doing it for everyone in the UK all of the time. People always suspected that Skype had been re-engineered to allow eavesdropping, Snoden proved it. And so on. 

No IT professional would have been really surprised by any of it. What *was* big news was that the info was coming straight from the horses mouth, with actual primary sources. That's major. 

Nevertheless, the true conspiritards believe in mind controlling fluoride and chemtrails, so the whole Echelon stuff was pretty mundane and boring to them.

In which case you'll want to focus your attention on accumulation as opposed to income funds. The former automatically reinvest dividends back into the fund, allowing that cash to contribute toward future gains/losses.

A well diversified portfolio is generally recommended as it avoids putting all your eggs on one basket. Unless you plan on picking a range of index funds and actively managing your exposure to each, something like the Vanguard Lifestrategy range of funds are very useful for passive investors. Not only do these benefit from low management fees, they adjust exposure to various markets on your behalf, saving you the trouble. 

The risk of each Vanguard Lifestrategy fund is generally considered to decrease the greater the proportion of bonds that make up its portfolio (bonds offer low but consistent returns). Their 100% equity fund is therefore the highest risk portfolio, while their 20% equity fund comprises 80% low-risk bond holdings.

Typically, if you're a younger individual and investing for the long-term, you can generally make do with a lower proportion of bonds in your portfolio as you're likely to be investing longer than any dip in the global markets.

For reference, [here's their 100% equity Vanguard Lifestrategy fund (0% bonds; highest risk)](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000MLUS). As you can see from the [portfolio tab](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000MLUS&amp;tab=3), the fund is primarily exposed to the US and UK markets, with very little exposure to emerging markets. There are other diversified funds out there with higher exposures to emerging markets, if you fancy them. They have slightly higher fees and a slightly higher risk associated with them.

Well obviously I'm not clairvoyant. But I stand by it as a prediction with a logical basis;

Ed Miliband has one of the lowest personal approval ratings of any labour leader in living memory, particularly for one who hasn't been incumbent. For 5 years the Tories have been running a very successful campaign to undermine him - and whilst a lot of it is pretty harsh, it's fair to say he [doesn't always help](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9409370.ece/alternates/w620/v3-miliband-selwynv2.jpg) himself. 

Couple that with the fact that incumbent governments almost always lose popularity - and if you look at governments that don't they tend to be those that secure big majorities (like Blairs 97' government) and so can pass legislation aggressively in their first term.... well even with SNP support Miliband is going to be struggling to pass his budgets and his Queens speech, let alone anything more radical. 

Then finally is the popularity of the SNP in England. The left wing have softened up to them recently with the debates, but I'm fairly certain the centre ground and the right see their brand as very much toxic... an unpopular leader in league with an unpopular party (the SNP) is unsuprisingly going to be pretty unpopular. Any deal with the SNP will also cement labours losses in Scotland for the foreseeable future.

Then finally is the election itself... whoever wins this time round has a pretty tough job, they've broadly got to keep the financial plan on track but the scope for further cuts and efficiency savings is getting quite limited... most of the easy stuff has already been done in the last 5 years. Social issues like the housing problem also look set to get worse before they get better - regardless of how many houses they manage to build, which is almost certainly going to be lower than the targets they've set.

Thought not.

So let's be clear.  However stupid and hateful her column was, she was not inciting violence in the sense that people are actually going to commit violent acts because of her words.

Yes, I understand she was promoting violence as a solution to stopping Africans entering Europe.  But, should that really be illegal?  Where does it end?  Should it be equally illegal for someone to ask for the death penalty to be brought back?  What about if someone argues we should take military action against Syria?

Finally - isn't it enough that her argument was completely destroyed in the court of public opinion?   Or are you so fearful of the power of Katie's argument and the stupidity of the populace that you think she could actually win millions over to her cause?

My main advice if you want to do more:   
1 Take a camera to mark your hard work down. You can also blog the photos to keep a more permanent record.  
          
2 Think about where exactly you want to clean up, and try and think about how the litter gets there. Im guessing maybe you saw the story shared about a man in Berlin (I believe) cleaning a river bank? Most of that litter is not dropped directly there by passers by but comes in from the river and stays on the bank. In more urbanised areas school kids and busy business men are never going to take 40 secs to find a bin and this is probably what happened to you today. You expected to not be challenged but were. Some suburban areas are much better for this. I've seen a girl pick up all the trash she sees on the main road near me a couple of times and wanted to thank her for it but she's way too fast at power walking. Maybe find a road that's more suitable and possibly one that means something to you?     
     
3 Don't expect to made a hero. I don't mean that in an aggressive way. Some people may thank you, others will pretend not to notice you and you already met the shittiest of all people. You are restoring a cleanliness to the area out of your own will. Its not something most people have done or will ever do. The action of spending 20 mins doing something 100% selflessly is its own reward so do not look for others to commend you. That said - well done. I applaud your effort. I can only hope those that mocked you come to their senses as time goes by.

There are additional difficulties in renewing Trident that the SNP will probably be able to exploit.
First and foremost, the threat of Scottish independence within the next lifetime of Trident is a non-ignorable risk that the rUK would be forced to disarm. Second, the argument for the Union was won during the referendum but the argument for Trident was lost. It will be a major constitutional issue if nukes are renewed on Scottish soil without support of a majority of Scottish MPs. 

The SNP may not be able to force disarmament, but they will probably be able to at least get the base out of Scotland.

Just briefly (as brief as 22 players can be) my thoughts on Chelsea's best youth talents and their likelihood of making the first team:

**Probably**

* **Solanke** - Already making the bench. Needs to bulk up, certainly no problem scoring goals.
* **Brown** - Again, already making the bench, needs to improve on his decision making.
* **RLC** - Probably the closest to first team action. Just needs to experience the grind.
* **Blackmann** - Really solid young ENGLISH goalkeeper. Hopefully stays to fill backup.
* **Bamford** - If he is loaned out next year and keeps scoring he will make the 1st team.
* **Kalas** - Ivanovic 2.0. CB played out on the right an is excelling. Can see him being the RB heir.
* **Traore** - Needs to play in a stronger league, but looks like quality forward.
* **Kane** - Thought he may have sputtered out, but looks like he could be a solid backup full back. Always the change he just gets released though.

**Maybe**

* **Aina** - Another solid fullback, which is arguably the most important position in Mourinho's systems. Needs to prove himself on loan somewhere.
* **Colkett** - a unique player that is showing potential. Lampard-esque ability to be in the right place at the right time. But we also said the same thing aboud McEachran.
* **Musonda** - To young to tell but certainly has all the technicaly ability in the world. Can he emulate Hazard or go the route of Kakuta? 
* **Boga** - More direct than Musonda, looked quality this season. Needs a step up.
* **da Silva** - Arguably our best youth FB. Can attack and defend well. Needs to either A. Get taller or B. Add muscle.
* **Ake** - Made the first team this season, didn't do much. Verdict is still out but hopefully he wows us soon.
* **Chalobah** - Has the build and skill to play in the PL but incredibly inconsistent. Shows runs of form both good and bad.
* **Baker** - I think he will be a PL midfielder but not with Chelsea. Hard to see how he fits into the system unless he can improve as a deep lying midfielder.
* **van Ginkel** - Injuries are the flag here. I think MvG is a walk into the first team (over, say, Mikel) but his ability to not be available hurts.

**Doubtful**

* **Kiwomya** - Not transitioning well to his promotion. Not showing the spark he used to.
* **Palmer** - Flashy goals aside, very streaky. Very much doubt it.
* **Abraham** - Tammy could go either way. Hard to argue against his goal scoring record this season. If he can repeat, my opinion will change.
* **Piazon** - Flashes of brilliance but otherwise mediocre loan spell. Could see him going to someone like Inter Milan.
* **Omeruo** - Solid but otherwise unspectacular. Was amazing in the past, but has dropped form this season.

There are many others that could probably be in this list but just wanted to highlight the ones I feel have the most reasonable chance.

Something that is really lacking in Dota 2 is an explanation how to run low level teams. While I wouldn't say I was amazing at it, here are some things I learned.

1: Anyone who tells you that you need to be XYZ MMR is wrong. Not only are there plenty of events around your level, but also playing in a serious team is the best way to increase your personal skill level. You're gonna be playing against players who are far better than you and your team, causing you to increase in skill immensely.

2: Moving on from that, the 4 players (And yourself) are going to have to get used to losing. Quite a bit. The skill level of amateur events is all over the place, and it's rare to get even teams. Avoid sticking with only events that you win: The only way you're gonna get better is to practice against better teams.

3: Find 4 players who are willing to put the time in. This was the hardest point I had. The main mistake I made at the beginning was having a casual approach to things. DO NOT DO THIS. If you plan on simply having games ""whenever"", then you'll find all 5 are never on at the same time. Put out specific times you wanna play together. And ORGANIZE. I build a exel template below with some useful stuff:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQo0tnvmZ-CRkn-v1Pu8tyVtB7Eef1d6u3yPR6mVIaM/edit

4: Keep a list of players until you reach a solid 5. At your level, it's hard to find people willing to put the time into things, as well as maintain moral while losing. This means you're gonna go through a lot of iterations of your team until you find 5.

5: Don't rage ingame, and don't ignore team problems. My biggest mistake was hoping if I ignored the attitude/personality issues of certain players, that they would go away eventually. As a leader you have to put your foot down and make shit stop, whether that is through talking or simply through kicking players.

6: Avoid Starladder. Seriously. So many russians. For all the rage pausing and bantz you get in the UK scene, the CIS scene is filled with so much bad sportsmanship. People putting in wrong scores. People trying to get def wins, etc etc. Throw in the ""Skype only"" rule, and the stupidly high number of matches for AM, and it just isn't worth it unless you're aiming for pro league.

7: Get into a habit of watching your replays as a team after games.",null,0,null,1429554814,null,0,false,0,cqiqvwx,null,t3_338n0o,null,t1_cqiqvwx,null,t3_338n0o,null,null,null,1432501221,null,2,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,2,null

""The trouble is that, even as the Equalities Commission worked hard to prevent racial stereotypes, a troubling proportion of them, as Phillips concedes ruefully, turn out to be accurate. These are statistics laid out by his programme: a third of London pickpockets are Romanian (how Fagin would have loved them!); black people are six times as likely to be jailed for robbery; the Chinese are tops at people-trafficking; when it comes to drug dealing, Afro-Caribbeans are pathetic amateurs compared to the Colombians; meanwhile, white idiots are the national champs of alcohol-fuelled crime.
Phillips and a Muslim former senior Met officer agreed that the police’s reluctance to use racial profiling arose from an attitude which was basically: “OK, maybe you’d catch more criminals, but they might think we’re a bit racist.”""

""He interviews Ann Cryer, the veteran MP for Keighley, who years ago took up the case of several mothers whose daughters, aged 12 and 13, were being used for sex by local men, nearly all from the Mirpur district of Pakistan. Neither West Yorkshire Police nor Bradford Social Services wanted to know. To the politically correct, this was simply a category error: white people did bad things to black and brown people, not the other way round.
With the authorities meekly condoning multiple “cultures”, however misogynist or backward, and making it a crime to criticise what was unacceptable, brutal or downright illegal, even tolerant people grew angry and disillusioned.
“The mistake we made,” says Phillips, “was we gave people a kind of cultural exemption from normal, reasonable, decent behaviour.”""

from a review in the Telegraph of his documentary.


Don't you think it is a bit of a coincidence that Pakistani rape gangs were not stopped *anywhere*? Do you think that every single city has  an incompetent police force?
Do you really think that the accusation of the Lawrence inquiry that the police were ""institutionally racist"" had nothing to do with this?

Since your whole rant sort of hinges on this I just want to hone in on it.

Bertrand was hardly inexperienced when he debuted for Chelsea in Munich. He had well over 100 appearances for other clubs in England (not just the Chelsea youth team) under his belt in 2012. He had played for the first team something like 15-17 times in the 2011/12 season. He was also 22 years old.

The team was also dealing with suspensions for Ramires, Meireles, and Terry. The European squad was pretty thin on the bench to begin with.  DiMatteo played Bertrand as a winger which is *not* his position. That and the other options to play out wide were basically Malouda, Torres, and Sturridge.

What's your point here? We should have started Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Dominic Sloanke against Manchester United? Why? Because the best time to determine the pedigree of a young player is when you need to beat a Manchester United that was on a 9 game heater?

null,false,JackXDark,null,null,null,"&gt;Do satanic cult's even exist outside of horror films? 

Sooooort of.

The Church of Satan and its various related offshoots are pretty much militant atheism with added Ayn Rand. The Temple of Set is one of the few large-ish groups that believe in a literal theistic devil figure. They once got caught holding a satanic ritual orgy in Exeter Cathedral, which made for some brilliant news coverage when it came to trial. *(""Yes, your honour, I can confirm that there was sodomy on the altar, but no there were no goats or sheep sacrificed or buggered m'lud, despite some speculation"")*.

There are then various things like the Temple of Thelema and Aleister Crowley's legacy, which involve ritual magic that sometimes gets a bit naughty, and things like the Temple ov Psychick Youth which are anti-establishment and have some nutters involved.

There are also around 40-50 covens of various types of people practicing witchcraft of various sorts, and a probably smaller number of groups of voudou practitioners. 

None of these are organised on 'cult' like lines though. They don't want to recruit people and there are considerable barriers to entry. The Church of Satan blatantly says that you've got to be a successful individual who can hand over a chunk of money without it being a problem. 

All that said, there *have* been a few occasions where these groups have gone bad in serious ways. There was a small group in Wales that were into quite nasty stuff that got busted a few years ago, and a group in Croydon that was trying to get members to have babies to raise a 'moonchild' which was sooort of the source of some of the 'satanic cults raising babies for sacrifice' thing. And a small handful of individuals that claimed to have various magical powers, in order to try to intimidate victims. There are also a fair few proper nutters on the British occult scene that might be dangerous if they could actually get their shit together, but who stand zero chance of actually starting any kind of cult, but who might have the potential to cause serious harm in other ways. 

There is also a **lot** of *fear* of witchcraft in some African churches in the UK, which has led to children being subjected to some pretty nasty stuff. There have also been rare cases like of the kid found in the Thames, which may be linked with magical practices of African origin, but I don't think that's very cult-like and is probably down to a very small number of individuals like the scamsters who advertise in the Metro, but taking it a bit further than just ripping people off.

Mostly though, in the UK there are three people; Valerie Sinason - a psychotherapist with some very dodgy ideas; Kevin Logan, a CoE vicar who sees the devil everywhere, and Sean Manchester, who is a charlatan bullshitter extraordinaire that claims to hunt vampires and bust satanic cults whilst being an archbishop (who may actually turn up to comment now as he vanity googles a lot...), who have tried their hardest to keep the British Satanic ritual abuse bullshit going, and many of the scare stories in the UK can be tracked back to their involvement somewhere along the line. 

So yeah, sort of, not really, definitely not like your horror film type stuff, but not a total myth either.

if we fail to be challenging half way through next season, give him the sack. if we challenge all the way through and don't make top 4 and a trophy (both should be attainable), he should get the sack. the average age of the squad is very young, with lots of quality, but we need some experienced players who have a rich history of personal success and hopefully team success in their CVs...we lack leaders and personality right now and are going through somewhat of an identity crisis. 

no excuses for the poor start to the season other than the fact we lost 51 goals out of the team by september. i also think 7 to 8 new faces in the squad was going to disrupt the harmony some...you also need to think, this time last year we had only played about 38 matches vs the almost 50 or so we've played...so lots of things have change very quickly for us, and we didn't step up. i see this season as a failure, but i don't see it as one that BR cannot (and should be given the chance to) pick up the pieces from. his quality as a manager have been clear to see numerous occasions throughout his tenure, and now it is about hitting the ground running vs tinkering and finding our feet when it's too late. based on our post january peformances, we would easily be top 4 if you extrapolated that over the course of an entire season. mid table teams don't usually go on runs like the ones we have before, and i think with 3-4 signings that address the St, CM, RB areas with real quality, we will genuinely be a challenger. 

I know people are getting their heads turned by klopp right now, but lets face it. he's going to man city. there is no way in hell we'd get klopp. de boer? he would be great in theory but thats another project coach without any experience in the premier league. his best qualities would be his connections from the bundesliga and eredivisie which could be valuable if we could get him in as a director of football, but that's unlikely. the st etienne coach (saw a link today)...same deal with de boer, but is vastly unproven as well.  BR wears liverpool on his sleeve and is fighting not only for his job (which is secondary) but for this club and this city. I think that provides him with value beyond anyone else being brought in at this point. if next season rolls around and we're fluffing around still, fuck it, axe him. i am thoroughly as disappointed as the next fan, but to give up now would be an utter waste considering i think br could get us top 4 next year with some good signings. this is the exact opposite of a sunk cost fallacy in economic terms because we are not just investing time and money, but an entire philosophy that comes along with BR. to pick that up and change it like that would be foolish without giving him one more season for his project. FSG gave him a 3 year extension knowing very well what his timeline was going to be, so give him one more year so we don't have to buy him out of his contract with no rewards.

So first, the manager of Liverpool is too fearful to drop Gerrard out of the side even though he is being repeatedly overrun and exposed. Within the first 5 minutes of the 2nd half, he was blatantly exposed twice and just couldn't keep up with any of Villa's players. Then he goes on after the match about how he's played excellent when that clearly wasn't the case.

The overriding theme here is that Rodgers just hasn't got the cojones to criticize or drop the guy and it's honestly the absolute last thing you want to see in a manger of a club this size.

&gt; Benitez performed a miracle when he won the 2005 CL final. That helped Liverpool regain a lot of prestige. Also, at that point, the Big Four was Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Man Utd, since City money had not come in. 

The 'Big Four' was only a thing from 2006-09. The year we won the European Cup we finished 5th, below Everton and Newcastle were still seen as contenders for a Champions League place every year. The 'big four' would not form until the following year.

&gt; Then Hicks and Gillett happened, as did City with their oil money. We tumbled into mid-table mediocrity whilst City took the top 4 that was previously ours.

Hicks and Gillett 'happened' in February 2007, and we spent 2 and a half years thriving under them. When they came in they spent more money on transfers than we had ever done under David Moores. Yes, they were shit owners and didn't have a clue about football or sports in general but they didn't immediately send us torpedoing into mid-table mediocrity.

null,false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"&gt; I find this a very misanthropic view of humanity - that people are such idiots that if someone tells them that migrants should be shot then there's a significant section of society who can only dumbly nod their heads in agreement.

But people will agree with it, although it may only be a small number. These people need to be confronted and debated with, and if you simply ignore Hopkins and her arguments because they're too extreme, you're allowing these people to hold these extreme views without any legitimate criticism. 

&gt; And it's also a very paternalistic approach. We know what's best for Sun readers, so it's up to society to arrest anyone who might be leading them astray.

No, it's saying that if someone comes out with inflammatory and extreme views like Hopkins has, they should be challenged on it. It has nothing to do with talking down to people with different views. 

&gt; Finally - and most importantly, I think it's wrong. I think that in the long run and in an open society, good ideas really do win out over bad ones. For instance, take a look at gay marriage, or consider how public perception has shifted with respect to racism.

And how did these 'good ideas' overtake 'bad ideas'? Through those who hold those 'bad ideas' being challenged, not through those people being ignored and the 'good ideas' arbitrarily coming to the forefront.

1. London is a far more attractive destination (ask Sanchez). 
2. Frequent lack of Champions League football. 
3. The lack of the above taking away leverage from negotiations forcing overpayments and thus much higher risks. 

If there's any positives from this season, the defense has looked miles better. 36 conceded so far with a game in hand is still plenty to work on before it is top 4 quality, but a good improvement nonetheless. 10 goals fewer this season compared to last at 32 games played. 

Instead I prefer to focus on how Liverpool will do it because the above model won't work for them necessarily. Rodgers first focused on implementing his system of choice, getting Suarez and the rest of the team to move, establishing those runs and the 6 lines mentioned in his manifesto. That resulted in last year's title challenge, however with a very thin squad and a leaky defense. His goal was 70 goals to get top four, he overperformed and delivered 100 and gave a title challenge. This year he saw the impact a leaky defense had and is now has 10 goals fewer conceded compared to last season. However the lack of a striker due to injury has hampered the goal scoring hence losing out on 4th (save for a miracle).

Arsenal's way worked for them. Liverpool have their own way that can be just as successful after the rebuild. The marquee signing might not work given the three reasons above and calculated youth risks may be the best option.

Based on this, we should keep Rodgers for another season. If he makes enough mistakes like yesterday next season, we won't make top four (I honestly believe that we *should*) and then he needs to go. Not only that though, it is highly likely that Klopp would need time to find his feet here which could massively hamper our top four chances.

Last season the guy pushing for his place was our second choice right back. So he was able to walk into the team when he was available for selection.

my hope is that Ben Davies does take his spot at times because it means the competition is still fierce and also means that if something happens to Rose we *should* have a beast of a back-up waiting to try and make that spot his long term.

He's said he doesn't want to take a break so he'll find a club. That's honestly the only thing. If Klopp hadn't announced his resignation, I'd definitely say stick with Rodgers. 

The title run in last year could be the worst thing that happened for him. He didn't get the reward of winning the league which would've made his job security untouchable, but he got heaps an heaps of expectations laid on him and his best player taken away. It's all so strange.

I think this point is really the crux of your argument, but I would suggest that most of the hostility to the SNP in England is largely because the only experience of them has been through the nonsense printed about them in the media.

After seeing them in government here since 2007 I'm fairly sure that both left and centre politically minded people will find some things they disagree with but a lot that they agree with.",null,0,null,1429557291,null,0,false,0,cqisgmz,null,t3_337y18,null,t1_cqisgmz,null,t1_cqiozau,null,null,null,1432501963,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You cannot just assert the very point that is being argued. Especially as a referendum now looks more and more unlikely in the foreseeable future and thus subject to increased negotiation if those proposing it want it to go ahead. 

 
We've seen from the independence referendum that
the EU is very much at the heart of the modern British identity. Any significant changes as regards the EU without the support of Scotland raise a whole host of issues that those advocating a referendum don't seem to have thought about. 

I dare say that the double lock is merely a starting stance for the SNP when it comes to negotiations.

null,false,chefnowserver,null,null,null,"&gt; Rodgers needs to stand up to FSG's 'Moneyball' methods in the market.

The problem is a fundamental misunderstanding of 'Moneyball' methods, and how it's actually a combination of transfer policy and tactics.

The idea of 'Moneyball' isn't to simply acquire young talent on a budget, and develop them then sell them.  That's not Moneyball, that's just what poor teams do.  If anything, Moneyball statistics would suggest going for established players in their prime, who do all the 'right' things, who haven't had that break-out season, but maybe are just stuck at a smaller club.  

For instance, in the baseball version, they went to statistics, and tried to figure out which tactics lead to victory.  Then they tried to find statistics which were a good indication of execution of those tactics.  Then they went out and got those players.  The canonical example is valuing on-base percentage over RBIs.  

A soccer parallel would be to value a statistic like possession losses (obviously the inverse) over passing percentage.  

The reasoning is that on a successful team with successful players, everyone's going to score lots of goals.  Everyone's going to have successful passes.  Ronaldo scores 50 goals a year for Real, will he do the same for Liverpool? 

But what are the little things that players do, that will create a successful team?  What are the traits that a player who is currently on an unsuccessful club will have that can translate to success if he's used as the right piece to the puzzle?  

The problem with Liverpool's version of Moneyball is that it's not making full use of available statistics, and it's not being developed in conjunction with a proper tactical plan.  

And one doesn't need to look beyond the 'top' teams to see players that conventional wisdom would suggest aren't very good being used to great effect - for example, Fellaini for ManU and Belgium, Ramires for Chelsea, Blaise Matuidi for PSG and France (prior to playing for PSG, Matuidi's conventional 'stats' were terrible, yet watch a game - he contributes far more than would be expected).

The problem isn't Moneyball and statistics, it's that Liverpool has done a poor job fitting their transfer policy to their tactics.  And Rodgers certainly hasn't helped the situation.  Putting Lambert on in the 90th minute is a huge 'WTF'.  Throwing away games and a ridiculous squad rotation through various competitions is another.

“Obviously, I am involved heavily in the identification of the player,” Rodgers told the ECHO.

“The principle idea when I first came in was that like any manager you will have the first call on a player and the last call.

“That’s the call on whether he’s good enough to continue to look at and try to organise a deal and the last call to say yes or no.

“There is a big part that goes on in between. In modern football you need to trust other people to do the work. That’s something we do here and that’s why we have had the success we’ve had.

“The finer details of that are left to Ian who does a terrific job and our other guys in that field who will go through the contracts. I am aware of where the situation is at right the way through the process.

“We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn’t want in. That’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club.

“We work very closely together – it’s worth stressing that. It’s key that we are very much one club.""",null,0,null,1429559569,null,0,false,0,cqitx99,null,t3_339q8t,null,t1_cqitx99,null,t3_339q8t,null,null,null,1432502722,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

 we'd be fucked. Our only option is, and has been for a while, go out all guns blazing, and hope our attack is the best form of defence.

I know this sounds stupid, but I cannot think of a better way to word it. If you think about when our defence has had a really good game, mostly it's when we've been on fire attacking.

A) He's vastly superior at pressing and tracking back. Easily one of the best in the side at this, to the point where I actually worry about him being overly-aggressive. 

B) His movement is clever and creates more space for others. Lamela makes a lot of subtle movements which simply aren't seen by his teammates (or supporters for that matter). The little run he made which Bentaleb picked out and resulted in a great chance is typical of his game. I don't think he has nearly the same incisive passers surrounding him as he did at Roma. 

C) He has the best final ball in the squad. Lamela's problem is he usually gives the ball away before he even has a chance to play the final pass, but when he is in a situation where he's able to weigh up a through ball he does it far better than Eriksen. Not even talking about his routine assist yesterday...more along the lines of the pass against LFC and several other very clever reverse balls. 

I still think there's an evident quality and intelligence about Lamela that keeps me hopeful for his future (not necessarily at Spurs) as a player. I would personally keep playing him through his struggles the rest of this season. Towsend and Erik have both had good runs in the team and neither has really done enough as far as scoring goals, but Erik has created more in the Premier League and is much better off the ball.

I'm not a diplomat or political academic or anything like that. I'm saying things that other people with more knowledge have been saying. I don't think I'm qualified to answer that question.

But the premise makes sense to me - countries can better control other countries when those second countries are controlled by people who feel okay with being told what to do by the first countries. Iran would like as many countries around it to be Shia, and Saudi Arabia would like as many countries around it as possible to stay Sunni. And some percentage of each group will always be willing to fight for some cause as long as the right religious or nationalist subtext is used. And the West is just going to support whichever side can fight for them and give them cheap oil (and maybe take a stance on Israel).

In my mind, their destiny should be up to them. Every country seems to go through certain tough stages to get to a stable government which rules in favour of the people in some way, maybe we should leave them to it and defend ourselves where needed. But Britain has been involved in the Middle East for so long - for longer than 100 years. And I think as long as Britain or its allies need oil, it will continue being involved. But it feels like whatever we do, we do it in a way which just seems to fuck things up further.

It remains to be seen whether it will have no effect or make the situation worse. If it makes the situation worse because the tax take is actually reduced, which is the most moral option for those starving people?

I mean in general terms you aren't making a point I disagree with, but at the same time, if we were to apply your calculation to things across the whole legal spectrum I think we would live in a very different world.

Extreme example for sure, but couldn't I make an economic argument for immediate execution of all murderers without appeal after conviction? Leaving them alive costs money, and they might even be released one day to kill again, which would be more immoral than killing them to prevent it.

As a society we have plenty of laws in place which may cost us money, but are there for moral reasons. The very existence of the NHS is one example, costs a ton but is there for an essentially moral reason - everyone deserves healthcare.

The gap between us and Spurs is paper-thin, whether you accept it or not that is the harsh reality today. 

We have always been the 4th best team in this country at best (at least for the last 15 odd years) and now we are fifth since the huge influx of money at City and where are we now? 5th. So what does that tell us? It's not Rodgers' fault, it is the way things are. 

Yes yesterday was a disappointing day but it doesn't mean that we have to sack Rodgers or it's a crisis. Two domestic cup semi-finals and a 4th spot run-in with 6 games to go is hardly a crisis.

If anything it is the impotency of the transfer committee that I'd put my blame on. Lack of a proper striker for over 80% of the whole season can get to any top class manager and that needs to change.

Those who are calling for Rodgers' head are knee-jerk fickle minded filth who call themselves ""fans"". You are nothing. Liverpool FC is defined by it's manager it's players and it's supporters (that's the word) who get behind their team and who can separate the wheat from the chaff and not by these fucking fickle minded people who have got nothing better to do in life than moaning about the things they think they support. These moaners are deceiving themselves with their behavior and no one else. 

I am not saying that this was not a disappointing season or Rodgers has not made mistakes but what I am saying is that calling for his head is too early and it disrespects the Liverpool way because we do not talk about replacing our manager while he is still at the helm. 

Those who like to get swayed by the media are the ones who always follow the narrative because they can't think for themselves.

Edit:  I am *not* claiming that the law should be different for Islamists and Sun columnists.  But I do think that there is a difference in how seriously we should take their language.  I'm sorry, but if an Islamist starts talking about e.g. blowing up an airport then I'd want the police to follow up, whereas if Katie Hopkins said the same thing then I'd assume she was being a troll.

The SNP actually broke their policy of voting only on Scottish matters to vote against the rise in tuition fees in the last Parliament because they see it as a fundamental principle.


People always underestimate how strong the SNP commitment to tuition-free education is. I've heard Alex Salmond speak about it and it's clear he passionately believes it's one of the very core reasons for Scotland's success in the past (i.e why one tiny country invented so much) and the key to success in the future, and that's a view shared by all of the leadership.

I've had a go at people for dropping litter out car doors etc. They don't expect it.

Having now glanced again at your earlier post, you yourself hint at why it cannot be exclusively man made: ""There is of course pollution caused by natural sources..."" The Earth's climate is constantly changing and has been doing so long before man came on the scene. Man necessarily therefore cannot be the only cause of climate change.

&gt; Also I couldn't tell from your post but 'climategate' wasn't scandal at all but a simplified slide in a presentation for none (sic) scientific experts. An inquiry concluded their was no misconduct, nor attempt to misrepresent data.

Climategate was the revelation that the threat, magnitude and impact of climate change had been exaggerated as a result of hacked emails being leaked. This is not the same as misrepresenting data.

Sure it's technically possible, but it's not going to happen.



Especially now there's a precedent set by the last referendum. That will pretty much be the carbon copy any future referendum will follow. It is practically unthinkable that Westminster would refuse to allow it to happen again if the SNP manage to get a vote for it passed in the Scottish Parliament, because all that would mean is that the Scottish Government would hold it's own non-legally binding referendum which would be much, much easier to win when you can base your entire campaign on the very rabble rousing idea of London blocking the democratic process in Scotland.

Hopkins didn't say they were vermin because of their race, she said it because of their criminal behaviour. Insulting her words may well have been but that is not the same as racist and certainly not the same as stirring up racial hatred.

2. Spoilt ballots do not carry the implication of dissatisfaction with the voting system. At best, they carry the implication of dissatisfaction with the choice of politicians on offer, which I'm not.

3. Spoilt ballots contribute to turn-out figures, which strengthens the image of FPTP and allows advocates to point to higher turn-out figures and claim the system is accepted by the public at large and working satisfactorily.

As I've said, the most damning aspects of FPTP are hung parliaments and low turn-out.

In the right situation, it may appear that the home country of any foreign combatant is giving implicit or explicit approval of any and all actions taken by said citizens, and this could be a massive coup for any propaganda. To give an example:

I actually do what I say what I want to do and disappear off to the Ukraine to fight alongside the Russians. I am not a Russian national and do not have dual nationality either, but am a British citizen alone. I am then captured and the Ukrainians find my British passport. It could likely prove a massive disaster for British support of the Ukraine as their government could easily question as to why, if the UK is an ally, why its citizens are working against Ukrainian interests. The British government in such a situation is going to find it very difficult to diffuse such a situation, as proving I acted alone would be pretty much impossible other than on my word, and its hand would be forced to take action.

Last season was amazing, and no-one can honestly believe that Suarez carried us that season. The diamond formation was genius, the tactics were more or less spot on, its a shame we slightly missed out on the title, and he deserves the credit of making the side which finished 7th the year before into title challengers.

However this season he seems completely different, stubborn tactics and making poor decisions and it just seems odd. I don't want to see him go just because of this seasons poor results and I think people are forgetting the groundwork he has put in, a new manager would completely uproot the clubs stability (if you can consider us stable).

I'm curious as to what a new manager could do for us if we could get Klopp in, and I would love to see Benitez back, but I don't think sacking Rodgers is right at this time. Its hard to judge Rodgers on 3 very different seasons.

If I'm near my home or a shop that sells them, I would go back to refill my bags, but there's times when circumstances don't allow you to pick up dog poo.

&gt;So now what about my question? Katie Hopkins seems to be calling for an extreme version of Westernism, including gunboats to see off the migrant threat. Is there any link between her rhetoric appearing in mainstream media, and attacks on foreigners and migrants?

Yes, possibly there could be an indirect link between what a Sun columnist says and actual real world violence down the line.  However, I don't think such cases can or should be dealt with by the law.  

Why?

Because it's impossible to prove links like this beyond reasonable doubt.  Someone could be influenced by a thousand and one things and maybe reading a Hopkins column was one of them, but how could you hope to show that?

And I just don't think you can hold people legally responsible for indirect and completely unpredictable outcomes.  Doing so would kill free-speech.  It would limit people's ability to criticize anything because there'd always be the possibility that somewhere down the line, someone somewhere would take the remark too literally and it could contribute to a massacre.

null,false,OllieSimmonds,eng-sussex,Sussex,null,"&gt; When and if Scotland leaves the UK it will be because Tories stopped treating it (and chunks of the north of England for that matter) as regions deserving even handed consideration.

It's not quite the same for Northern England. If you look at a map you'll see that the Tories occupy by far the most land in the entire UK. It's really just urban areas in the North in which they struggle.

Scotland is a very different beast in that seats with similar economies and similar demographics consistently went to the Lib Dems or the SNP. Almost the exact same kind of seat anywhere in England would have gone to the Tories.

Anyway, I would argue that if you look at the support of the whisky industry, if you look at the support of the oil industry, if you look at the success of the financial service industry particularly in cities like Edinburgh, the Tories have done a lot for Scotland. 

But I broadly agree, for the Union to survive there needs to be a strong Unionist Party North of the border.

I understand that and have some sympathy. What I don't have any sympathy with is the approach taken by so many here and how shocked some seem to be when they're told how difficult it might be to get a ticket, this despite explaining with some accuracy how many tickets are available at the Bridge for home games. 

As /u/SuperDanPetrescu points out, the loyalty system does indeed reward loyalty. It's not perfect, and we're always looking into ways of improving that. Supporters' groups are in constant discussion with the club and it's an issue that comes up often. 

I also understand that you see there is nothing wrong with a secondary market in ticketing, and to a point I agree with you - if it weren't for the fact that there's no system for it in this country - but the simple fact remains that selling on a ticket, at face value or otherwise, is in most cases illegal in this country. It certainly is for football tickets bought from Chelsea Football Club. 

There are only a few ways you can guarantee that what you're getting is the right product and a safe purchase:

* From the club box office, either via the phone or online ordering, for which you'll most likely need a membership as so few games go to general sale these days
* Via the official ticket exchange, which requires at least a membership
* Via Thomas Cook travel packages, which are expensive
* Via the numerous supporters' groups around the world who will have their own allocation of tickets

Anything other than that and you're taking a chance. 

Where I don't have sympathy is when people rock up and _expect_ to get something when they haven't even considered the above options. I appreciate that people occasionally are caught short and want to go to the Bridge, but it's the artificial level of expectation that's difficult to deal with at times.",null,0,null,1429567122,null,0,false,0,cqiypf7,null,t3_337ibr,null,t1_cqiypf7,null,t1_cqiniaj,null,null,null,1432504976,null,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5,null

Insurers score a policy on ~40 criteria; if you live anywhere near a city (""high risk area"") prepare for double the quote of a rural address. Neither age nor experience are the deciding factors. 

Also, if you're a named driver, you may only be third party fire and theft and will have to pay the full amount. OP, contact the other party, ask them about their policy excess (which they'll have to pay) and whether it's really worth the cost and higher premiums for everyone if it's only cosmetic damage to their vehicle.

The question is whether either of those players/future players of similar ability would have/will come to Liverpool if Klopp or someone else is the manager. ybe they would, maybe they wouldn't, it's impossible to know. However Rodgers has gotten a lot of things right at Liverpool including last year's improbable title challenge and the overall development of several key players (Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge). It would be a risk to sign any new manager even if it is someone with the track-record of Klopp. However the single reason that I don't want to see Rodgers leave is because under him Liverpool has become a team that has ""built the right way"" by developing young players and remaining loyal to servants of the club even if it hurts the team (cough Gerrard cough). I think that in a world where every successful team is subsidized by a billionaire owner or fucking United the uniqueness of Liverpool's way of doing business actually means something. If in 5 years the current core is still together and 3 or 4 new top players have been added to the roster this team could become a European contender in its own right through a long process of sustained growth.

While he was briefly closer than two seconds, he was also slowing down and therefore able to react more quickly. Not only that, but the two second rule is an advisory part of the Highway Code, rather than compulsory.

I see no issue with flashing his full beams. While the reason given below was tenuous at best, the flash communicated a Highway Code endorsed message: his presence. Personally, if I saw someone breaking the law in such a manner (causing a hazard, as well), I would likely do the same. It also had the added benefit of highlighting the cyclist's presence to other road users, in case they had not seen him.

Given the length of the flash, I do not believe that you could credibly accuse him of breaking [Rule 114](https://www.gov.uk/general-rules-all-drivers-riders-103-to-158/lighting-requirements-113-to-116)

The cyclist was, in this case, riding an un-roadworthy bike. [Highway Code Rule 60](https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82/overview-59-to-71) *requires* bicycles that are ridden at night to have white front and red rear lights lit. They are also *required* to have a red rear reflector. It is quite clear from the video that his skin is more reflective than anything on his bike. He shouldn't have been on the road. There was also the small matter of running a red light.

And as it is, they're getting from whatever hellhole that they were in, across the mediterranean with a large proportion of them not able to make it only to have to go into temporary accommodation where they are processed to get asylum or whatever. There are three major options from that point.

Keep it as it is in which case the rate of people entering these temporary accommodation remains higher than the rate that they are possible to be processed. Conditions in the accommodation will deteriorate, potential for the spreading of infection and problems with water supplies due to the (large number of) muslims among them washing before prayer. Meanwhile, vast numbers of people are dying at sea still.

Laxify restrictions on the border. This sees lots more people, often with no relevant qualifications and little knowledge of a relevant language entering these countries putting extra strain on the welfare systems, both the finances and the simple amount of housing available. Quality of life for these people will be low albeit probably better than the countries they came from. Meanwhile, laxer border controls will encourage more people to attempt the crossing, in all likelihood leading to more people dying at sea.

Increase boat patrols in the mediterranean, with the intention of stopping boats before they make much progress in the crossing. Will condemn many people to have to remain in unstable or unsafe countries, potentially forsaking high risk individuals. Potentially increased numbers of boats leaving shore to try to get some through, but overall likely a reduction in deaths at sea.

It's a fucked up situation, and there's right answer. Ultimately, all  we can do is hope people with access to actual numbers and simulations will be making informed decisions, and acknowledge that any action or inaction will have massive costs in life, quality of life and monetary.

null,false,pistachiogurl,null,null,null,"That looks like its bordering on eczema which is what I have around my eyes and eyebrows and the only thing I have found that really does help is the Aveeno cream which i slather on morning and night on my dry patches. 
Since I only get these flair ups sporadically and the rest of my face is combination I have to find products that will work with my skin but wont irritate any dry areas I get around my eyebrows and eyes.  A good idea is to apply a cream on it and slather on some Vaseline over the top at night, it really works but can take some getting used to.

I use the Simple Kind to Skin Moisturising Facial Wash too, im not super impressed with the moisturising claim but it removes the residue I get from my night cream without drying out the rest of my skin only my eczema patches slightly (but so does mostly anything else or just washing with water alone) but if I use the Aveeno on those areas right after washing my face then I dont have a problem.  At night I use an oil or cream cleanser which never seems to irritate my dry patches too much but I still use the Aveeno before bed as well as my usual night cream so in the morning I dont have scaly eyebrows or eyelids. 

Another good option is the Simple cleaning lotion, I can use this in the morning and at night and even as a makeup remover without it super irritating or drying out the eczema and all you need is one product for all three tasks. Although I still use the Aveeno morning and night.

On the same line as the Simple cleanser I really highly recommend the Lush Ultrabland cleanser, its awesome sauce! Again can be used for morning cleanse, night cleanse and makeup remover and it does all jobs wonderfully. Super hydrating on dry patches but doesnt clog or make my combination skin oily. Ive run out of mine and im in the process of using up all my stuff before I repurchase. Its really great and when using this and nothing else at all  even in the way of cream for my eczema my face clears up of spots and redness. Because of its texture I find its almost like using the Vaseline technique but in a far less gross feeling way.

What I was trying to convey, is Arsenal SHOULD have been a mediocre club and had no right to be a top four club during that time period. 

Liverpool should have been a lot more successful than Arsenal, as Arsenal ranked 10th on net spend between 2003 - today. 

They were selling a star player, literally ever season. The fact they had such a poor injury record, in fact supports the view that we should have done to overtake them.

My apologies for not been clearer, but my broader point which I don't think was quite picked up by your response, was that even without Champions league these players were very obtainable. 
There weren't bidding wars over these players. 
There was no guarantee particularly back then, that Arsenal would be in the top 4, 
Indeed they cut it narrowly more than once. 

More broadly, Dortmound, weren't always a big European player, Neither was Atletico, Yet both if you look at the quality of their squads have been exceptional. I would assume Liverpool has more financial muscle and prestige particularly 5 years ago to obtain these players. They've just persistently failed on the recruitment front, and thus are moving further and futher back from the top 4, whereas these clubs get stronger and stronger

Importantly, it's not asking you if you think she was the best/ worst - you need to look at her impact. As other commenters said - this will be areas like her new economic policy ('monetarism' is a good area to look into), her rejection of Keynesian economics which had been broadly accepted policy after the war,  privatisation and the 'small state' ideology, and her strong stance in areas like the Falklands. 

I would avoid being *too* politicised unless you can back it up with research, but it's certainly worthwhile discussing her legacy from a contemporary point of view. (e.g. widely polarised figure). I wouldn't bother with the comparison against other political figures as that is much more subjective. Instead think of the question in the sense of 'what was her impact? What did she do? How was it different than what came before? What is her legacy?'

null,false,Daltesse,lfc12,,null,"I really hope that Rodgers stays, because next season takes out the one real problem that he couldn't solve. Steven Gerrard. Rodgers had an idea where he wanted him, similar to Siggurdsson in his Swansea team but soon realised that he didn't have the legs. He's changed team shape and tactics in order to accommodate Gerrard, and the semi was a prime example of this.

At half time if Rodgers wanted to make a change, Gerrard should have been the one to make way for either Johnson or Manquillo. Move to a 4-3-3 with Can the holding player. Other than that amazing run in the second half of last season, Gerrard has been mismanaged by Rodgers, who for some reason can't or won't acknowledge that, unfortunately, Gerrard is past it. How he could describe Gerrard as magnificent yesterday is beyond me. As one other post said, for years Gerrard carried Liverpool, it's sad to see Liverpool now carrying Gerrard.

Next season, we need an experienced striker, hell I'd take back Aspas at this stage, if we can't get someone in. We'll have Origi, who will be good but he's also very young and we can't expect him to be getting around 25 goals a season straight away and, as we've seen, we can't rely on Studge with his injury record.

We have a very young and potentially great side, we do need a little more experience, even that 'can't win anything with kids' team had Schmeichel, Irwin, Bruce, Pallister, May, Keane, Cantona, Cole, and McClair. Even Giggs had 4 and a half seasons under his belt at that stage.

We have a very exciting group of youngsters, a manager with a proven track record of bringing on and trusting youth and getting a good deal out of them. We already have Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C(4-3-3, 3-4-3, and 4-4-2 with a midfield diamond).

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"I feel there are a few things you're glossing over a little bit in your analysis. Namely:

a) Whilst it's true that Arsenal's team is made up now of inexpensive players, you can't just cherry pick their current first XI and what they cost and say that's all you need to spend. Every transfer has risk involved, and at the very least you've got to approximately double the value of each good player you list to account for the bad player(s) purchased alongside. 

Arsenal bought Giroud for £13m, and this season at least he's seemed like a great buy. But they also bought Podolski for £11m, who has been far less impressive. Arshavin for £15m never seemed like a great bit of business either. They signed Ramsey for £5m, but they also signed Sebastien Squillaci for £4m only to release him on a free a few years later. 

Players are, like any investment, tied to an element of risk that they might not end up being worth what you thought they'd be when you bought them. At the very least if you're going to only include the players that were successes, you've still got to inflate their prices to factor in the extra spending you need to float the inevitable dud signings. 

Saying clubs just need to spend the exact amount required to build a first XI of the best and cheapest talent of the last five years is no different to saying that to be a millionaire all you need to do is sink all your savings into the best performing stocks each year. Nobody has that hindsight at the time. 

I'd also argue that, while we're cherry picking signings, Sturridge (£12m), Coutinho (£8.5m), Ibe (£500k), and Skrtel (£6.5m) are all looking like fairly good value for money too. 


b) You seem to deride Arsenal's transfer policy as awful because they signed young players who then fucked off before they became useful for the team, but a good reason that Arsenal only spent net £70m compared to Liverpool's £250m in the last 12 is because of those players leaving the club for significantly more than they were bought for. Players like Nasri, RVP, Adebayor, Fabregas and Song all left, but they pulled in the best part of £85m in return that went towards financing the likes of Giroud and co. 

Arsenal only got themselves into the position they are now from building upon years of years of incrementally improving the value of their squad by buying cheap, developing, and selling high. And unless you can afford to just plunge £150m directly into new players like Man City and Chelsea could, and Man Utd still can, there's no way to short-cut that process. Which is why we're having to do it the hard graft way, and is why we're probably not going to be in the top two or three places in the league for the next three years or so at least. But it's a necessary step in my opinion if we ever want to get back to regularly being in the top four.  

***

I mean, ultimately if your posts boil down to ""spend your money better"", then I agree. But isn't that kind of obvious anyway? The difference between a bad investor and a good investor is that a good investor makes more money - not only is it relatively obvious, but stating it still doesn't really give much indication of how a bad investor becomes a good one. 

I think right now Liverpool's strategy isn't bad, it's risk-averse, and risk-averse doesn't typically get you high returns (titles) in the shorter term. But I think that's important, because I don't feel we have the squad that could survive putting all our eggs in one basket if it goes wrong. If we buy four or five fairly low-price players then we keep depth, and so long as we buy wisely enough and have a good development team, those players will at least maintain or go up in value and strengthen the total value of the squad.

If we spend big on one or two players, then suddenly the risk goes up. If we get a Suarez, great, top four. If we get a Carroll, we're fucked, because we can't really afford to waste £35m and an entire transfer window on a dud player. 

Last summer we were linked to both Falcao and Sanchez, and fans were bitterly disappointed that we didn't get either. But if we had gotten one (and chances are it'd only be one) then instead of some depth and somewhat promising players like Can, Moreno and Markovic, we'd be reliant on one star player. And if that player is Sanchez, then great, but if it's Falcao then it's an expensive flop and we're several places below 5th. 

It was only three or four seasons ago that we finished 8th and 17 points off 4th place. 7 points with a game in hand is far from ideal, especially considering last season, but still being mathematically in with a chance of top 4 at the start of May is a lot better than we've had on average since Benitez was sacked.

Lennon has also been given more game time (although this is probably due to Lamela injury, he only played 331 minutes last season).

I agree that stats don't show the whole picture, but the parent thread is discussing the output of said players - Lamela is provably better in this regard. 

Of course, we can go on to discuss things like age, technical ability and defensive contribution. But Lamela comes out on top in all of these areas in my opinion.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** First impression on back of hand, it's very liquidy and doesn't have any whitecast. It feels like nothing and completely weightless in about 10 minutes. There's still shine but it's not tacky or greasy.

On the face, unfortunately, it doesn't sink as quickly, and it stays greasy and wet even after 30 minutes. I had to blot a bit, but then it became nice and matte and makes a real good makeup base. There's still a thin veil of whitish haze, but nothing super noticeable. Concealer + light dusting of powder makes face looking neat already. No oil control, though. Also, for a few minutes after application, face feels warm and there's an ever so slightly tingling, which then disappears. I really hope this won't wreck havoc in the long run.

It passes my initial sunscreen criteria well! Now, I just need to give it a full test run for at least 10 days to see if it clogs, breaks me out, flares up my SD/PD and/or induces PLE. I'm crossing my fingers real hard it won't. I will come back to update and edit my review accordingly.

This will definitely double my monthly skincare expense, but a great sunscreen I can use is hard to be found!

*Update*:
After 6 days, I realized this sunscreen was clogging me quite a bit. Fortunately, it's the type of clogging I can still tolerate and manage. Instead of flesh-colored or little red bumps which are more unsightly, with this it's whiteheads that are close to surface and flake off when I scratch my skin.

Luckily, it doesn't seem like it flares up my SD. It's only been 6 days, but if it does, I would have blisters between my eyes and busy scratching them right now.

It stings my skin a bit at first, also in the mornings when I used Retin-A the night before, but it doesn't last long. I wouldn't say it's consistently comfortable. I have to use my hydrating serum underneath to mitigate what felt like mild irritation.

I'll keep this in my routine, but I will rotate it with other sunscreens that pass my test.

In conclusion, this sunscreen:

* has insane PPD
* is more cosmetically elegant than most in terms of greasiness and tackiness
* gives slight haze of whitecast, but I'm NC35-40; fair and light skinned, rejoice!
* I'm pretty sure on drier skin (mine's combo), it would dry matte (I'd have to blot) and would look like you powder your skin
* alcohol may be too much for some
* clog/acne-prones, beware! I'm managing my skin with azelaic acid, tretinoin, glycolid acid and oil cleansing. they *may* have helped with potential worse clogging.

It's far too soon to be brandishing the pitchforks. He seems a decent guy and is always a positive force with regards to the players we have and the progress we are capable of making.

Of course, being positive is well and good, but when our squad is, on paper, a far stronger team than what we fielded last year, it does lend itself to some head scratching. Talking to an Arsenal fan (he's a friend though, so let's not hold that against him), he seems to believe that Martinez doesn't instil the same cohesive chemistry Moyes brought with him to the locker room - and this got me thinking, is the Gooner on to something? The whole Distin situation, and more pertinently, Mirallas' penalty fiasco seems a situation that would be unlikely under Moyes. I'm just throwing the idea out there, and seeing if any of you have better insight or ideas as to if this could contribute to Everton not performing to their potential. 

I've personally had moments where I was frustrated with Everton, and even began to assume we'd lose on the weekend, but I'd still watch each game. Now that we've had an upturn in form and are unbeaten in 5, I feel petulant and silly. Regardless of where we finish this term, we should get rid of that defeatist attitude and idea that the season is over and we just need to survive it. I, as a newer fan of maybe only 7 years may not be well versed in the prerequisite cynical approach, but I'm not happy with being 12th on the table, and am loving the boys in blue putting in a solid shift towards the end of the season. And you better believe next season I'm expecting even bigger things!

Aaron Lennon has been great and can stay permanently, and I'm really wondering about the Baines/Garbutt situation. Will Bainesy be converted into that Lahm-esque midfielder we keep hearing about? Is Mirallas going to go? I agree with /u/Himinahomina and dross like Kone and Alcaraz don't have a place on our squad.

2014... the club made .9m pounds.  900,000 pounds.  That's really not that much money.  

2013... they lost 49.8m pounds. 

The total revenue for 2014 was 255m pounds. I know that sounds like a huge amount of money, but it's really not.  I work in oil, $500 million is a drop in the bucket.  My site has a CAPEX budget of $1.2 billion, even with oil down to 55 dollars a barrel.  

My point is, fans think that football is a money printing venture, like clubs are swimming in cash - which is rarely if ever the case.  Something has to give, and ticket prices are unfortunately one of them.  The real problem is starting in the early 90s, athlete salaries have blown up at 20x the rate of the of inflation.  Considering that paying salaries are the largest expense for almost any business you come across, that's not a small piece of the ticket price puzzle.

http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2014/11/chelsea-fc-announces-annual-profit.html

Even Chelsea made less than a 20m pound profit.  Considering that 20m pounds is the price for a decent striker, even Chelsea is one player purchase away from losing money or breaking even.

Arsenal only made 5m pounds. 

http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/detail/article/club-record-income-of-530-million-euros

Even the mighty Barcelona made ~41m Euros, what is that about 22m pounds?  Again, one striker away from losing money that year.  ",null,0,null,1429579850,null,0,false,0,cqj63di,null,t3_337in3,null,t1_cqj63di,null,t1_cqicwf6,null,null,null,1432508527,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

&gt;Players are, like any investment, tied to an element of risk that they might not end up being worth what you thought they'd be when you bought them

Exactly. Even further, judgment of transfer fees fluctuates wildly. Someone like Ramsey looks an absolute steal after last season, but probably just looked like a good gamble at the time before that, when he'd struggled to hit any significant form. Further, Giroud has looked to be priced about right for talent, if maybe just not good enough, until this season. Come next January, the opinion on these transfer may all change again.

Your second point is also spot on, and is really the reason Chelsea is where they are this season. Yes, they've spent astronomically, but they're in compliance with FFP and their next spend for the past two seasons has been ~£30 million. It seems very obvious, but when you can sell players for more than you bought them, your transfers are no longer financial gambles--they become free trial runs. It doesn't hurt you if you buy one Christian Atsu for £3.5 million and he flops if you can sell a Kevin de Bruyne (who made 3 appearances in the EPL) for £18 million.

Your example of Falcao v. Sanchez is perfect, by the way. I would also say that the transfer strategy of Liverpool is smart because, in theory, it allows for the big money signing *when there is value*. With Suarez, Costa, Mkhitaryan and Sanchez, FSG has shown they are willing to go after a large signing if the value is there. Otherwise, the club continues to seek the more risk-averse deals, as you say, which allows for the spending power when value is in the market. This is similar to the Red Sox, from what I understand, where FSG will spend boat loads in a given year if the players are there for the right amounts.",null,0,null,1429581749,null,0,false,0,cqj79lk,null,t3_3380to,null,t1_cqj79lk,null,t1_cqj3bbf,null,null,null,1432509079,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** I got this as a sample that was only good for one usage. I wish I didn't try it at all.

Well, first it applied really nicely and dried matte. Felt a tad heavy but still less than many others. However, the color was totally off for my skintone. It has beige-y tone, which can still be manageable, but the shade was at least 2 shades darker than my skin. It may fit NC/W15-25 better.

What was worst is that immediately after application, my face felt warming up and then the whole thing burned and was itchy like mad. It felt really horrible and my eyes were watering profusely. I dashed to the bathroom and took it off with oil cleansing. While doing so, my face still felt stinging and the rubbing with my washcloth was hurtful, even though I tried doing it as gentle as possible. I immediately slathered vaseline on my face, but my face still looked pretty red.

I suspect it's either the high amount of fragrance and/or the cinnamon extract. Leaning a bit towards the latter because once I tried a perfume oil that has strong cinnamon note and the inside of my arms were red and itchy and I ended up with rash because I couldn't stop scratching.

I would strongly advise sensitive skins to stay away or try to get a sample first.

If it was an essay, for history class, I'd probably take in the following:

Firstly, Thatcher's claim(s) to importance in her own right:

- [delrio_gw lists many](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/33a0a7/small_question_on_past_britain_politics/cqj1i73) of her key policy moments, achievements etc
- however, over and above any individual policy this sort of claim on her behalf arises because she (supposedly) dismantled the [post-war consensus of british politics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-war_consensus) which had (supposedly) reigned for 35 years through Con and Lab govts.
- In turn, Thatcherism, or at least many elements of it, (supposedly) because a new political consensus, which survived future alternations to Labour govt, because [they accepted it](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jun/10/labour.uk1)

In other words her leadership (supposedly) stands out on a whole other level to your Wilsons or Majors because while they 'did things' within their political context, she did things + permanently and completely reshaped the political context.  (Supposedly.  These supposedlys are added to indicate some of the areas of academic debate...)

Secondly, you'd have a look through [the list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom#20th_century) and see if there are any contenders.

Being as this is school level and our word count is ticking I shall blithely hand-awave away most of the list as non-runners and point to Churchill and Attlee as the prime people to give some coverage.  Churchill for 'winning the war', most obviously, although remember he had a complicated career either side too.  Attlee for 'inventing' the aforementioned post-war consensus, and the welfare state and the NHS all all of that stuff innit (obviously not literally personally inventing).",null,0,null,1429586763,null,0,false,0,cqja5h2,null,t3_33a0a7,null,t1_cqja5h2,null,t3_33a0a7,null,null,null,1432510510,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

My personal opinion is one of utter confusion, Baines has been a fantastic penalty taker for us and so it should continue. I think MAYBE with Mirallas there was inter-team politics going on, if Mirallas can become the penalty taker then he adds 5-10 goals a season which makes him look so much better than he really is (Hey Wayne!!)

What I am not in favour of is disregarding sensible management of personal finances in order to achieve it. Sensible management of personal finances involves contributing in a balanced manner to a number of different pots. Saving for a house deposit is one. A pension is another. An emergency fund is another, as is paying off any debts you might have.

You would be shocked at the number of people who have managed to save a deposit by age 35 or whatever, but fail to mention that they have no pension, no emergency fund, £5k in credit card debt and still owe £10k on their car at 5%.

This is exactly the type of stuff that got people make bankrupt in 2008/9. If you overbalance your personal finances towards buying a house as quickly as possible, you leave yourself no margin of error if something goes wrong - you lose your job, interest rates go up, the housing market drops suddenly. All of these things can happen.

So I always advise people - yes, buy a house. But buy it when:

* You have saved the deposit, without neglecting the other 'pots'

* You know that you want to live in that place for a long time, and your employment situation is long-term stable

* You can afford the repayments - not just at 2%, but at 3, 4 and 5% too, because those rates *will* eventually come around again

* You are buying it as a place to live, not as an investment. If you own one house, it is not an investment, it is your home",null,0,null,1429595066,null,0,false,0,cqjdq27,null,t3_3399sw,null,t1_cqjdq27,null,t1_cqiwmpl,null,null,null,1432512194,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Just that it's time up for Rodgers. He is way, way out of his depth.

Get a manager who can operate at that level and show results and  get us in the CL, earn his money and buy such players. Let Rodgers be at a level where he can, a mid table club with mid table ambitions. 

If he's here, he will have to get us into the CL. Like it or not. And win something along the way. 

Another factor is that the club, seemingly, cant keep world class players here. Taking that into consideration, we will get some stars along the way and they will leave. But Brendan needs world class stars to drive us up the table. He will not have them always. Fair enough. Get someone who can cope with those peaks and troughs and through his managerial mettle keep this team going. Someone who has an eye for a player when he sees one.

“There is absolutely no way a player will come in here if I don’t want him,” 
“I will always be the first person it comes to. That’s not being arrogant, that’s how we operate here and how it works in this country.
“Abroad it works differently where you have a coach and the club will bring in the players. The coach then works with the players he’s given.
“A lot has been made of it but the fact is the process that happens here is no different to what happens at other English clubs.
“We have a number of people, scouting staff and analysts, who will look for targets who fit the profile of the players that we want.
“Then I will sit down with those guys, look at those targets and make a shortlist from that.
“All that work that goes on is of great help to me. We identify players, gather all the information we possibly can and then if they’re right for what we need it comes down to whether they are affordable and available.
“I know the club will go and do the best it can to get the players we want. But it’s very clear that anyone we sign will be because I want him here.”

Brendan Rodgers has praised the work of Liverpool FC’s transfer committee as the manager reiterated he will have the final say on all signings this summer.
“The principle idea when I first came in was that like any manager you will have the first call on a player and the last call.
“That’s the call on whether he’s good enough to continue to look at and try to organise a deal and the last call to say yes or no.
“We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn’t want in. That’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club.
“We work very closely together – it’s worth stressing that. It’s key that we are very much one club.

&gt;**Mike Gordon, Director**
Gordon, who sits on the board of Liverpool and the club's parent company Fenway Sports Group, has been described as the man who runs Liverpool on a day-to-day basis, the link between owner John Henry and chief executive Ian Ayre. In his late forties, he has the deepest knowledge of football of anyone at FSG and is its eyes and ears on Merseyside.

&gt;**Ian Ayre, Chief Executive Officer**
Born in Liverpool, Ayre was appointed commercial director at Anfield by the club's previous owners. Lifelong Liverpool fan who was appointed managing director by FSG and promoted again to chief executive earlier this year. Is responsible for negotiating transfer fees and contracts. Has explained the transfer committee theory thus: ""Your biggest expenditure line can't be the whim of any individual.""

&gt;**Dave Fallows, Head of Recruitment**
Joined Liverpool amid great fanfare in the summer of 2012, leaving his role as first team recruitment and scouting co-ordinator at Manchester City, then the Premier League champions. Liverpool had been looking for a sporting director to succeed Damien Comolli, who left the club in April 2012, but dropped that search after Fallows' appointment.

&gt;**Barry Hunter, Chief Scout**
Former Wrexham and Reading defender who had a spell as Rushden and Diamonds manager which ended when he oversaw their relegation out of the Football League in 2006. Hunter, 43, joined Liverpool from Manchester City with Fallows. Hunter had been City's chief scout for Italy, Switzerland and Russia.

&gt;**Michael Edwards, Head of Performance and Analysis**
Edwards analysis of potential targets makes him a key figure at Liverpool, where owner John W Henry has regularly spoken of his admiration of a 'Moneyball' philosophy - essentially the use of statistical analysis to find transfer bargains. Ayre has denied Liverpool have directly followed a Moneyball model but Edwards retains a significant influence over targets.

&gt;**Brendan Rodgers, Manager**
Appointed by Liverpool in 2012 following the departure of Kenny Dalglish, whose demise followed the ill-fated £35m signing of Andy Carroll, still the highest fee paid for an Englishman. Rodgers has input into signings but does not always get his way - players such as Michel Vorm and Ashley Williams might now be at Liverpool if he had have done.",null,0,null,1429596974,null,0,false,0,cqjebim,null,t3_339q8t,null,t1_cqjebim,null,t3_339q8t,null,null,null,1432512474,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,-halcyon,null,null,null,"To try and understand people are jerks, I'll give an example (anecdotally) of how I see some some people live, in fact MANY people live, why poor people and minority ethnicities can generally seem like right cunts. I am not from the UK (from NZ), but this same kinda behaviour is present here too and I think the situation is similar. I have personal experience witnessing poverty (in my own large family), and their friends, their partners, partners and friends families etc. I live in shitty neighbourhoods filled with poor people. They are often cunts and I feel frightened walking down the street.

In general I notice they feel disenfranchised / forgotten by the larger wealthier community, they often struggle to meet their needs on a daily basis (thanks to poor education / mental health / intelligence / wisdom etc), keeping up with bill payments is very difficult, budgeting for public transport / car costs, trying to stay warm and healthy during winter, connected to the internet in an age that expects it, job searching is a confusing nightmare... I could go on just talking about how low income people struggle daily thanks to having complex lives and not enough money (or they can't stick to a budget). 

These people despite having happy moments in their lives are generally miserable and uptight most of the time because they are forced to cope this never-ending stream of setbacks, which is magnified due to the inefficiency of being in / near poverty. Happy moments are pretty much exclusively family moments or escapism (TV, drugs, internet).

This makes them impulsive and prone to addictions, usually from a young age (most kids start smoking around 12-13 iirc).

Lots of people are miserable with their shitty lives, their childhoods were shit, they turn into unromantic unaesthetic people who a large portion of society views as cunts, arseholes, criminals etc. So of course these ""cunts"" generally have no reason to care about anything other than doing what it takes to survive. Littering is fine because they don't view their surroundings are relevant to their own lives. It's all part of the world built and controlled by wealthier more powerful people who they feel oppress them. 

It's much harder to care about beauty or being a nice person when you're addicted to tobacco/alcohol/drugs which you can't afford, life is a grind, filled with difficult bureaucracy, other cultures are cunts to you, your own culture is a cunt to you, the police are cunts to you, the govt is a cunt to you, you have no real support network, you're getting older and your health is failing, your teeth hurt, shit never works out for you because you're an ignorant idiot (thanks again mostly due to circumstance)...

We live in an unequal society, while this inequality is present there will always be people who would not think twice about not only littering in right front of you but also smashing your face against the road and stealing all your stuff. Because you are a symbol of a culture that they feel is oppressive. Life is combat, everyone else is an adversary.

It's kinda senseless to hate these people for being such miserable cunts. They're just statistically probable to exist in our current society. I'd go as far as saying it's mostly not their fault they're cunts, any baby born into shitty circumstances and feel / are oppressed not only by the majority culture (in UK, white) but by their own arse backwards culture (religion, shitty cultural norms etc).

Not to say that all poor people are cunts. They're not. Lots of middle/upper class people are completely awful. But they're usually not the type that screams at you in the street or drops their McDonalds bag out their car window. I know a lot of poor people who are cunts but are also good people aside from the racist / xenophobic / homophobic / sexist beliefs they might hold. They sometimes act in shitty ways without caring, like littering, stealing, vandalising, drunkenly hurling abuse etc.

When they're your family you have to see past it and love them for their good qualities which sometimes masked by their often shitty attitudes / beliefs / actions.

Anyway, my point is only that nobody should take it personally that people are cunts. If you could see their lives you'd probably find they are shit.

Good point. Fans from all clubs, generally speaking, haven't adjusted to the ramifications of how ludicrously lucrative Premier League TV rights are becoming. Buying from other PL clubs - especially when they don't want to sell - is only going to get more expensive; player wages are going to go up, so 100k for Jordan Henderson isn't what 100k for a player used to be; and while CL still matters for attracting top players, it matters less for the club's balance sheet - still helps, just not essential.",null,0,null,1429597393,null,0,false,0,cqjeg0h,null,t3_33b9ac,null,t1_cqjeg0h,null,t3_33b9ac,null,null,null,1432512533,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

But at least they're not Tesco. Tesco is just the worst. They have complete and utter plebs packing your groceries, seemingly being dicks on purpose (putting heavy glass jars or cans on top of bread or crisps was a frequent occurrence).

Once, we ordered quite a lot of stuff and it turned up without bags. I asked ""where's the bags? You expect me to pick out all these items one by one? This is going to take all day"", and you know what his response was? He literally grunted. Like a pig. Urrrghhh. That's what he did. I shook my head in disbelief and just slowly brought items into my kitchen one by one while he just stood there like a bellend.

Obviously I complained immediately after this and was given a refund of the delivery charge on the spot directly to my card which was good of them, but ultimately pointless as this was the last straw for me. Never again will I order from Tesco online, no matter how many vouchers they insist on sending me. Also, that delivery charge refund was simply due to my order arriving without bags. The woman I spoke to had absolutely no response for the driver's behaviour and seemed to just not care, perhaps it's just normal now? I don't know.

To the analysis it self

&gt; You can't just cherry pick their current first XI and what they cost and say that's all you need to spend. Every transfer has risk involved
Completely agree, with this.

But this is why I’ve included net transfer spend figures. It’s a very very rough proxy for the aggregate of ALL transfers the good and the bad, and suggests even on a risk adjusted basis (value of squad relative to squad) we’ve underperformed. 

&gt; Saying clubs just need to spend the exact amount required to build a first XI of the best and cheapest talent of the last five years is no different to saying that to be a millionaire all you need to do is sink all your savings into the best performing stocks each year. 

Completely agree with this, beautiful analogy. 
 
1.To clarify and to borrow your investor analogy if you’re going to be an active investor picking every  stock (transfer yourself) and your consistently losing money (bad transfers)  or underperforming against your competitors in the market (e.g. Southamption, Arsenal, Dortmund doing more with their money) then a feedback loop needs to be set in place to correct this process. The fact that over 10 years we’ve spent roughly 4 times, than Arsenal on risk adjusted basis is indicative of a more systematic institutional failure. More alarmingly, an institutional failure we’ve failed to correct.

True, they’re have been good signings as you alluded to Coutinho etc, 
but on average we’ve badly underperformed, indicated by the net spending figures.

2.Moreover, no one is asking for Rodgers to hit home run after home run. Rather my criticism is he’s a manager of a major institution he is expected to perform in transfer market better than average, because as one of the bigger clubs in the world they should have better than average resources. It’s like a portfolio manager on the buyside underperforming a retail investor despite having Bloomberg!

null,false,Djandgo,null,null,null,"&gt;  You seem to deride Arsenal's transfer policy as awful because they signed young players who then fucked off

Should have been clearer here &gt; I think right now Liverpool's strategy isn't bad

and here. 
I didn’t think Arsenal transfer policy was awful, I think it was brilliant. 
It would also help to more precisely define words what is a bad policy, what is a good policy?
 I would define a bad transfer strategy as one that does not allow you meet your objectives. 

I assume the main objective for Arsenal was to pay for a stadium was to pay off a stadium. So they’re transfer policy was very good. The question than becomes what is Liverpool  objective? Presumably to become a consistent top 4 club. I think their strategy is currently bad, because 
a) They’ve failed to correct institutional transfer failures based on their track record
b) They’re best players in the Future Can, Markovic, Countinho are foreign. Thus if they get good enough, they’ll be transferred to either Madrid, Barca, Bayern thereby restarting the transfer policy. 

I say this because they’re been a shift in transfer policy in Arsenal. A team that was routinely ridiculed for being basically the French national team, has become the  British National team buying Chambers,Walcott, Chamberlain,Ramsey, Wilshire, Welbeck, and previously tired to be Smalling. 

Why this change? Because British players are less likely to leave for domestic rivals due to social pressues, alongside less likely to leave for Madrid or Barca (albeit this could be ability related as well). This is also why  Arsenal buys a lot of ex Barca, and ex Madrid recently, Bellerin, Fabregas, Sanchez, Ozil. Why? Again because on the assumption they do become good they are less likely to leave. 

Thereby restarting the process of building a  club. 

c) Potentially not even being suistanable 

This is the area that we’ve overlooked the most.

Our current strategy is risk averse we buy young potentially good players. But teams like  Arsenal, Man U will at some point will get saturated with first talent, that buying an expensive great player e.g. Falcao doesn’t represent value for money. 

They will therefore turn to our market, the young potential high ceiling market. We’ve seen this trend already with Chelsea buying players like De Bruyne, Lukaku, Salah. When this occurs it’s even going to be more difficult to return to the top

This is far less of a problem in Spain and Germany where the reserve teams exist as a senior club.

Having a consistent manager over time who can get to know the players over a much longer period of time and play them in a league that is actually challenging physically and will involve just visiting the less well financed clubs without having the shock of joining a club with many less facilities.

I really don't see how the PL can continue to be competitive (in Europe under the UEFA rules) unless the FA forces through B clubs a la RM Castilla. The English game needs it, and the football league needs to understand that.

That being said, it would also probably cause a massive culture change too. England is far more split up with fans numbers fairly well spread between clubs. Far more so than most other countries, particularly Spain. If that's a fair argument then FIFA should be lobbied to ban B-clubs.

Gazzaniga : continues to improve away from the glare of the prem. Looks comfortable collecting a cross now. Shot stopping ability improved.


Mugabi : a massive talent. Physically leaves his teammates in the shadows strong, quick, good on the ball.


McCarthy(c) : decent performance, enthusiasm in buckets, still got a mistake in him.


Wood : the calm sober yin to the captain's aggresive yang. Composed, decent turn of pace, good feet, big future.


Targett : we've seen better displays from him, unlucky with the goal, but there were glimpses of his fine attacking ability, brushed the post with a free kick, just the one signature Sliding tackle.


Reed : got about the pitch well, blocked a fair few shots. A majestic Hollywood pass in the first half hints at the other side of his talents. Unlucky with the red.


Gape : impressive corner delivery. Decent all round performance.


Hesketh : MoTM, no doubt. An artist in the trenches, unlucky not to get an assist or a goal.


Gallagher : showed glimpses of his new found wing ability. Speed, power. If he was more lethal in front of goal he'd be our Harry Kane. Connor Wickham might be a better comparison for now.


McQueen : bright beginning that fizzled out in the second half. Tried to make things happen with some long range efforts.
