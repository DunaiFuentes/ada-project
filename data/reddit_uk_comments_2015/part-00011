No it wasn't. The bombing campaigns of the IRA, as well as their other campaigns, had the main objective of forcing the British Government to the negotiating table in order to bring about a united Ireland.

&gt; If that were true we would have had a war. An actual war.

If they were afraid of starting a war I don't think they would have repeatedly targeted British heads of state, and members of the Royal Family, as well as hitting the economic heart of London multiple times.

&gt; Firstly, fuck you for even trying to insinuate that being anti-social or a spide means it's acceptable to be killed as a child.

Where did I insinuate that?

I said being an anti-social spide means you're not exactly innocent if you get a hidin' for it. Action, reaction and that. No mention of killings in what I said.

&gt; Secondly, there were several instances of bombs outside schools (including mine when I was 13, at my busstop).

Did they ever go off? I'm not condoning the practice at all, its a genuine question.

To this day there are still hoax bombs planted everywhere, and I'm near sure its due to little wannabe-IRA-men spides rather than actual members - though obviously I could be mistaken.

&gt; Thirdly, here's a website with a list of child murders on both sides.

My mistake then. There are a few instances there were it seems targetted - and obviously I will strongly condemn that shit.

How can you type that and not see you're basically saying the same thing as me? The people of Northern Ireland didn't want a United Ireland and the IRA tried to force it through a terror campaign.

&gt;If they were afraid of starting a war I don't think they would have repeatedly targeted British heads of state, and members of the Royal Family, as well as hitting the economic heart of London multiple times.

If they wanted a war they would have fought like men against the army rather than taking potshots and planting bombs and running away.

&gt;Did they ever go off? I'm not condoning the practice at all, its a genuine question.

Mine didn't, someone called in a suspicious package (a teacher I think) and it was controlled detonated.

&gt;I said being an anti-social spide means you're not exactly innocent if you get a hidin' for it.

You said punishment beatings of children were understandable if they were of a certain background. There were kids whose kneecaps were shattered because they were the wrong religion of their parents pissed someone off. That's cowardice in my book.

&gt;There are a few instances there were it seems targeted - and obviously I will strongly condemn that shit.

Of course you would, you're not a psychopath. That's the issue with Gerry condemning this. He should have sat there and kept his mouth shut (and then when someone inevitably calls him on it he can deflect it)

&gt;There does seem to be a lot killed in the bombing though, and in that case I will point to any conflict in history. 

Look at where they were placed in many cases. Omagh being the most famous I guess.

Now, we can maybe discard Manchester from a financial point of view. London and NY are ""similar"" in that they have obscene amounts of money flowing through them, enough to afford these buildings. Also, discard the fact that NY's geography can support the amount of dense buildup that it has (Google New York Schist).

But regardless, because it can be engineered around, I did some light research on why a place like London doesn't have more skyscrapers than it does. From what I found, it comes down to regulations on the amount of natural light that must hit street level. So I guess they must have very very strict regulations in place that takes a lot of bribery money to get around. I guess it took a lot of palm greasing to get a place like The Shard built.

 So, specifically referring to the acid spray zoning an offlaner out, yeah ok, if you put acid spray down, the offlaner will retreat. It's also a 22 second cooldown with 130 mana cost and if the offlaner is a scary one with kill potential against your heroes (read: clockwork, tide etc) you know what he should just do? Run past your acid spray and kill you because you don't have stun. Acid Spray is also a 130 mana cost spell that has no real presence until you cast it, unlike a stun. Fundamentally, having to cast the acid spray and it costing a third of your mana (unlike skywrath's Q for example) and it not being completely spammable means whenever you do end up dropping it  the threat is there, and yet you still have no stun to actually kill the offlaner, only zone him out. Yet XP range is 1300 and the radius is 625. Yeah, maybe you can place it perfectly so that it's directly in between him and the creep wave, but many times unless you have literal perfect lane control the offlaner should really be able to dodge it, go round and get xp anyway. It's not a good way of zoning out offlaners at all, it's mana hog and it means you can't do anything else, heck you can't even farm with your acid spray because you're using it to zone. The threat of a stun will always be greater than that of your acid spray down, I can almost guarentee that now without thinking too hard about the matchup. You also only buy one clarity and only sometimes go arcane boots, how is this even sustainable?

Also, no offence but you can't claim to advocate for when needed stun when it's needed when you've basically devoted one throwaway sentence to it with what I would see as bogus reasoning.

With regards to you talking about the stun being used only when you are being aggressive, sure, I can pay attention to that. There are some pretty fundamental things wrong with what you've said. You've said 

&gt;Stun obviously can be used when your carry wants to be aggressive and kill, but i generally prefer acid then stun.

Fundamentally, you are playing support, it is your job to gank the map if needed, it is your job to kill people, not the carry's job, his is to farm. You, by your choice to prefer to take acid greed acid greed are deciding that your early game will be a farm fest and not one where you kill a lot of stuff and can help your team in fights a lot. You should really be getting stun and moving around the map, using it to harass people, you can farm with the pull and stack camps, getting uneven levels in stun and acid to farm depending on how the game goes later, but theres almost literally never a situation where you should be using greed and spray to farm that early into a game apart from the one where you've decided that's what you're going to do. With sutn you're actually useful for TPs (level 3-4 is typically when your offlaner or mid could get dived or ganks) and you can also dive their offlaner or gank mid, but you're choosing the farm. 

With respect to the drums, you're spending 1850~ gold on an item that you are basically getting to get you into teamfights, tank spells and do more autoattack damage? I'm not sure if I'm understanding this correctly  but I'm going to try and reiterate the fact that you are a support, sure it is probably a good idea if you are making them target you, but you could also just be doing insane amounts of damage with medal + acid + stun combo. Remember, the damage is physical so that it's increased by all these things, add in the fact that heroes are going to have low armour (if you're not fucking ogre) at low level and you have ridiculous nuke effectively very early on. Combo that with a venge or a TA too and you're absolutely golden for one of the biggest early game nukes in the game, and it has a stun!  Also, that's literally almost a blin kdagger, possibvly the best item on that hero.

Let's talk a bit about stun though and why it's so incredible. If we compare the damage to either a Venge stun or an Ogre stun (Arguably the two most popular support heroes in dota with direct stuns) it does 150 physical damage, not counting reductions, Venge's does 100 and Ogre's does 55 at level 1. Already that's an insane difference and we haven't even factored in reduction. Both of those spells get reduced (typically) by 25% so that takes Venge's stun down to 75 and Ogre's down to 41~ and to get the same reduction from the damage of Alchemist's stun the target would have to have 6 armour. That's a lot of armour early game, a value most heroes wont get until later or if they've got a ring of protection and some extra agility (Or if you're Ogre of course T_T). Granted it has a channel time and a long travel time to compensate, but it's actually pretty reasonable that you get it off given that you have a setup stun or if you're decent with the hero. Also it's 1.75 at level one! That's a long stun. Why would you not use this for ganking? It's positively mind boggling to see you suggest that this hero should really be farming in the early stages in the game when he's that strong early. This isn't even counting the fact that your hero actually has an armour reducing ability.

The problem I see with your build, and I've stated this already, is that you believe it's a good idea to play a full farming core from the 4 role, sure this can work in some games but I think your view of the game is just extremely skewed. Sure, Greevils Greed is an excellent mechanic for gathering gold, does it mean you should ignore the fact that you're a support and just farm all game? In my opinion, no, not really. The game can call for farmy games, don't get me wrong, but by the time this is going to be relevant you should really be like level 8 or something and THEN you can transition into a more farming playstyle, at the start of the game though there's almost no reason for you not to want to gank, make space and kill the enemy team.

So really, the strength of Alchemist lies in a few things, his ability to farm stacks later on with Acid Spray and catch up with Greevil's, his ability to gank with his frankly insane damage stun, hisability to stay in temafights as he's retardedly tanky for a support and his ability to come online later as a core if you really need him to but you're ignoring all of that, focusing on the fact htat he has a gold generating ability and using that as an excuse to farm your way to victory because you don't trust your cores. I dunno, play it this way if you want but I'm convinced it's wrong and I really don't see the merit of this build.

TL;DR Please don't farm on this hero from level 1, for the love of God just go Medal Blink Stun and kill shit then transition into farming later on.

The option of banning mockery of their religion and prophet is not on the table and nor should it be.",null,0,null,1420822919,null,0,false,0,cnjlsnk,null,t3_2ruodk,null,t1_cnjlsnk,null,t1_cnjfirc,null,null,null,1424970030,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null
null,false,Zoneghost,null,null,null,"So I went and had a look at the case.  
  
tl;dr: she wasn't just expressing an opinion. She was trying to cause harm to get what she wanted.     
   
The elements of the crime were set out as below (note b and c in particular):  
  
&gt; We found the following further facts:-  
&gt; (a) The Appellant on each occasion sent the relevant letters which contained photographs which we found to be both indecent and grossly offensive.
&gt; (b) The Appellant sent such indecent/grossly offensive material
(intending or with the purpose of) causing distress or anxiety to the recipients.
&gt; (c) Recipients of such material were actually offended by such material.""  
  
Now moving past the fluff and geting to the ratio of the judgement we can pick out a few sentences:   
  
&gt; In my judgment, the persons who worked in the three pharmacies which were targeted by Mrs Connolly had the right not to have sent to them material of the kind that she sent when it was her purpose, or one of her purposes, to cause distress or anxiety to the recipient.  
  
She *intended* to cause harm. This isn't the same as offending someone, rather you are looking to cause psychological harm to the recipient of the message.  
  
However, this idea of harm was expanded upon when the judgement declares (rather aptly regarding your point):  
  
&gt; suppose that it were Government policy to support abortion. A member of the Cabinet who spoke publicly in support of abortion and who received such photographs in his office in Westminster might well stand on a different footing from a member of the public who received them in the privacy of his home or at his place of work  
  
The judge is making the point that you have to consider who is recieving the communication. In this case it was pharmacists not doctors. A doctor might be expected to take it better than someone who does not deal with this imagery in their daily life (I've ommitted that quote because.. text wall)   
  
There is then a big discussion about whether she was making a political point which is not really relevant to teh discussion we are having which is more broad. Essentially one strand of her defence was that causing the harm was fine because she was making a political statement (which you would be doing in your syria example). This is dismissed (the reasons are briefly mentioned in the quote below).   
  
The final conclusion of the judge is:  
  
&gt; Her right to express her views about abortion does not justify the distress and anxiety that she intended to cause those who received the photographs. Of particular significance is the fact that those who work in the three pharmacies were not targeted because they were in a position to influence a public debate on abortion. The most that Mrs Connolly could have hoped to achieve was to persuade those responsible in the pharmacies for their purchasing policies to stop selling the ""morning after pill"". But it was always likely that the photographs would be seen by persons who had no such responsibility and it was by no means certain that they would be seen by the persons who had that responsibility  
  
The main key is that she is causing harm (anxiety) and that there is no reason that you can defend this. Ultimately, the judge is saying that the right not to suffer harm is not being trumped by the right to make a political statement. This tension is resolved because there is no real way that what she was doing could have any consequence other than hurting someone.  
  
  
Ultimately, therefore, it would appear that the law was functioning exactly as intended. She was sending poor pharmacists pictures of aborted phoetuses to shock them into stopping stocking the morning after pill. The key point being: she wanted to cause them distress. That is an acceptable infringement on your right to generally be offensive.  
  
If the facts were different then the case may have been decided in a different way. The judge even says so when he says:  
  
&gt; I have had to consider whether to remit this fact-sensitive aspect of the case to the crown court for further consideration  
  
This is an admission that facts are a key component of the case.

The IRA saw Ireland as differently. The island of Ireland did for the the overwhelming majority, want reunification. It was the mollycoddled unionists in the 6 counties that were holding back the majority. They didn't see Northern Ireland as a country.

&gt; If they wanted a war they would have fought like men against the army rather than taking potshots and planting bombs and running away.

Guerilla tactics. It's how people fight against governments. Was the Vietnam war not a war because the North Vietnamese used the same tactics?

I'll not condone that attack at all - but I will mention for clarification, it seems that the bomb was a grenade or some sort of small explosive, seeing as it killed nobody. Still, I agree - an ill timed and regrettable decision.

No I didn't.

This is false and a downright lie, the location of the surgery does not allow for people to take advantage, it is not near any shops, major residential areas without parking or any business units. 

I've been to the surgery many times to take my grandparents for blood tests. I love that this only takes 10/20 minutes per appointment and that the car park always has plenty of space. The vast majority of patients that visit have blood tests only so they do not occupy spaces for long at all.

They're taking advantage of this and softening the blow by introducing free parking for the first 20 minutes. It's basically black mail to pay in case your appointment runs over. Which is rare but I'm afraid elderly patients will pay rather than risk a fine.

And ISIS see the Middle East differently. It doesn't change the fact that it is an inherent right for a nation to determine its governance and NI at that time was a nation of its own with that right. The majority did not want a united Ireland and they were being terrorised by the IRA into it.

&gt;Guerilla tactics.

That's actually a fascinating historical discussion, there's mild contention amongst some historians as to whether it counts as guerrilla warfare. The consensus is that it wasn't as the IRA/UDA were evenly matched and the British Army was not fighting a war in the traditional sense. It's really only the IRA, their supporters and the odd historian that claims otherwise. 

The Collins IRA absolutely were. 

&gt;seeing as it killed nobody

So unbelievably lucky that it didn't, a girl very nearly died. I also wouldn't really argue that ant bomb even a small bomb is acceptable on a school bus or only wounding *twelve* children is acceptable.

&gt;No I didn't. I said if they were anti-social little spidey pricks (the type that jump people for no reason, start fights to prove that their 'hardmen' etc, for further clarification) it is understandable if they get a beating.

Children do not deserve masked men beating them because you don't like them.

&gt;I'm aware of zero cases in which this happened - but if it did, I'll condemn that.

The official age at which the IRA would sanction a kneecapping was 16. Personally I think that is a child. There were several instances younger than that but most of the evidence is only from claims of the patient or their parents as the IRA wouldn't comment officially or blamed ""rogue elements"".

&gt;Omagh was done by the RIRA, I've never condoned any of their actions, their massive pricks.

**Product claims:**

*""Vitamin E Leave-on Moisture Mask is a serum like gel with wheat germ, glycine soja and jojoba oils designed to replenish and rehydrate your skin in just 10 minutes, leaving it feeling soft and supple.*

*Enriched with naturally sourced vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant that will help to shield your skin against environmental damage and premature skin ageing by combating the harmful effects of free radicals.*

*The intensive formula also contains a skin conditioning multivitamin complex, comprising vitamins A, B, F and H, which, combined with horse chestnut extract, helps to care for dry skin.*

*A serum like gel to replenish and rehydrate your skin in just 10 minutes. Multivitamin complex and horse chestnut to care for dry skin.
Antioxidant protection to shield skin from environmental damage and to prevent premature skin ageing.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I loved the Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser and was intrigued by the concept of a leave on mask.

**Your opinion:** Products like this and the Simply Pure Hydrating Serum are the reason that, for me, Superdrug trumps Boots every time. A lot of product for very little money.

The mask is peachy-pink in colour and lightly coconut scented but this dissipates quickly. The texture is a lightweight gel-cream that reminds me of strawberry blancmange! Despite the silicones the product is not oily nor sticky even with liberal use. Possibly intended to be a dupe for The Body Shop [Vitamin E Aqua Boost Sorbet] (http://www.thebodyshop.co.uk/skincare/moisturisers/vitamin-e-aqua-boost-sorbet.aspx)?

The mask is a surprise hit for me since I prefer rich balmy textures. It feels really refreshing and does provide a good level of moisture such that I don't need to follow with a night cream. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction.

IMO this product is suitable for many skin types from dry to greasy simply by adjusting the amount used. It can be use as a regular gel moisturiser by those who breakout from fatty alcohols or for anyone wanting a lighter summer moisturiser. I will definitely use this up and likely repurchase.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, glycerin, cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, propylene glycol, soybean oil, wheatgerm oil, jojoba seed oil, dimethicone, dimethiconol, fragrance, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, acrylates/ C10-30 alkyl acrylates crosspolymer, vitamin E, disodium EDTA, panthenol, alcohol denat, PEG-35 castor oil, polysorbate-20, horse chestnut seed extract, benzophenone-4, retinyl palmitate, inositol, calcium pantothenate, linoleic acid, biotin, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, coumarin, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone, Cl 14700, Cl 47005.""*

I am a fan of Leigh Woods, I have only been there recently for the first time. It is probably more geared up for Mountain Bikers as they have marked trails all over the place, but you can spend a whole day meandering around. They have hidden rope swings and weird little huts made of branches and an Iron age camp and things.

I have walked to Keynsham before, you can also go all the way to Bath if you feel adventurous by following the Avon Trail. You start in the harbour and follow the Avon all the way along (more or less). Some of it runs parallel or under the cycle path but it is much more scenic, a nice meandering walk on peaceful riverbanks.

The harbour in general is always a good walk, there is a path around pretty much all of it now, so you can do a whole loop from the Cumberland basin right to Temple Meads and back the other side. 

In Lockleaze you can start near the cups &amp; saucers mast thing (there are some old WW2 bunkers there) and explore the woods and the area round there. There is an obelisk on a hill and some hidden monuments near the big yellow house. Then you can head down and go under the Motorway, then cross over and follow the Frome, then it links up with Oldbury Court if you want. I think in theory you could also follow the Frome as far as you want starting from Eastville Park.

Severn Beach you can stroll along under the new Severn Bridge and follow it to Aust and there are still the remnants of the ferry, including an overgrown toilet block. I was interested as it is where a famous picture of Bob Dylan was taken, with the old (still unfinished) bridge in the background: https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photo/default.aspx?photographID=104 You can actually walk across the Severn Bridge if you want, I haven't tried that however. This is a bit more of a bleak kind of walk due to the two imposing bridges, but I quite like that.

1) In Islam, Mohammed when caught opposing his own edicts - declared as the word of Allah - created abrogation, whereby the last *ayah* was always the one to follow, any new ""dictation of Allah's word from Gabriel"" would then over-rule all former ones. This means whatever was recorded last wipes out the other things.

In contrast in the New Testament, for example, when several things are said on a subject they all stand. They have to be weighed against one another. That is why the ""Oh but Jesus said he was bringing a sword"" when weighed in the light of (paraphrasing) ""I bring your the sword of the Holy Spirit that separates flesh from spirit"" and Jesus stopping his disciples defending him with violence (and indeed miraculously healing a Roman soldier who was injured) - amongst many other scriptures that oppose violence - shows that an interpretation of this lone verses to suggest Jesus was starting a war is wrong.

2) Islam has no New Testament - well they suppose to accept the NT but say it's all lies and has been falsified and modified. 

The Old Testament supposedly records God's character but Christians follow Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament and showed us the way of peace, love, forgiveness. The reason the Christian message was, and is, so pertinent is because it opposes what people thought that should be doing based on the records of the Old Testament. Yes, the OT is violent and bloody - but Christians following Jesus oppose that just as Jesus himself did, that's the point.

Jesus worked against those things you're saying are terrible by bringing in an New Covenant.

Now on a separate point. Being Christian is about a relationship with God, all Christians are sinners - you can't become a Christian without recognising first that you're a sinner. Tony Blair didn't take us to war in Iraq because he wanted people to ""become Christians or die"".

It's not ""spot on"" it belie a fundamental misunderstanding of the very basic elements of the Christian faith.",null,0,null,1420825165,null,0,false,0,cnjn70a,null,t3_2ruczy,null,t1_cnjn70a,null,t1_cnjdfmf,null,null,null,1424969378,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I'd argue that the two of them have been muted as opposed to outright poor. 

Additionally, I don't dispute the fact that a number of players have been really bad this season, but this thread is about how Howard has looked worse because of the defence in front of him and not because he himself has been shocking at times. I tried to argue that it's incredible that everyone (in this thread) is willing to lay the blame everywhere but at the feet of Howard.
 
Personally, Stones is the only center back I feel confident with right now so in addition to replacing Howard and Robles, we need two or more center backs unless Browning can step up.

If you lose, then you get a CCJ which goes on your credit report as a default. This DOES happen with the more aggressive parking companies - they give you a couple of months to pay. If you ignore them, you get a court summons. If you don't turn up, then you lose by default. 

It used to be the case that you could ignore these invoices, because the invoice would only be valid if sent to the *driver*, but the DVLA only has the details of the *registered keeper*. So, without proof of who the driver was, the companies would almost never take this to court, because if the keeper turned up and said ""I wasn't driving. I don't remember who was"" the case would be thrown out.

However, the law has now changed. The protection of freedoms act 2012 now makes the *registered keeper* liable for parking invoices, meaning that you need to have a much more subtle argument to get the case thrown out.

There is now a formal appeals process called POPLA. There is a sure-fire reason of appeal, which is that the price charged on the invoice is not a ""genuine pre-estimate of loss"" - in other words, the price is excessive and effectively a ""penalty"".

Parking can be a problem, but it is the driver's problem not anyone else's.

I used to work near the station in a commuter town. There was a row of about 6 old houses with no off-road parking whatsoever. There was no parking on the road outside (it was quite a busy main road). The house owners decided that this entitled them to park 4 wheels up on the pavement.

For pedestrians, it was far too dangerous to walk on the road, so the only option was to walk sideways in the narrow gap between the car and the hedge. You basically had to drag yourself through the hedge. A thousand commuters had to do that twice a day, just because of a handful of selfish motorists.

If you can't use an extra 2% of annual revenue bringing in genuine proven quality you've got no fucking hope. We showed with the Sanchez bid we've no problem forking out in the initial deal. 

We brought in a record champions league income and TV rights income last year - http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2014/05/14/where-the-money-went-liverpool-top-premier-league-prize-cash-in-2013-14-140501/ look at that (sorry I'm on a phone) 

We earned c.£42m more in TV income ALONE last year and hit the premier league record for TV income. That coupled with the champions league money will add to around £70-80m increase in revenue. An extra £5m in wages this year wouldn't dent the surface of that. It's pure bollox to say we couldn't afford that, the owners don't believe in it, that's the difference. 

We could potentially have 2 World Class players in the team every week for that wage increase. As I said earlier, if you can't risk your money on the pitch as a club, you can't risk if anywhere and we will merely survive and try and keep up with the pack. Spirs for example - If we compete with them for a player there is one thing they have that we don't and that's London. They cannot compete with us financially yet they have beaten us to players in the past. Sanchez has won arsenal about 12 points at least this year, I know I wouldn't mind having those in the bank instead of the extra £2m a year we could have offered him BEFORE arsenal swooped in. Barcelona sold him for £2/3m less than we offered, but the owners wouldn't take him at that level and put it into his wages because it 'breaks the wage structure'. 

Now I know there are intangible effects to breaking the structure such as turmoil over existing players contracts but that's something that needs to be managed by the club. Were a giant of a club despite our position in the league. We've one of the biggest followings in world football, of course we can afford to pay big wages. Not on the city/united/Madrid bracket, but absolutely in the £180-200k a week bracket for a couple of players that would make a world of difference. Money talks and we absolutely have it.

Yes, and had France been bombing the shit out of Christian and Jewish nations a similar response would really not be surprising. Look at Gaza, they attack Israel all the time *and* their media publishes regular Jew hate. How should Israel interpret that? Is that ""freedom of the press""? 

Remember when Britain had Northern Ireland under lockdown? How did that play out for the number of ""Christian terrorists""? 

&gt; Islam is political, it includes a legal system, all muslims that follow Islamic tradition have political goals to establish Islamic rule and law.

So does Christianity. Our present legal system is firmly grounded in Christian tradition. Our oath of truth was, until quite recently, founded in the belief of a occasionally vengeful Christian deity. 

You speak as if you think these are hard and fast requirements. Interpretations of ""Sharia"" vary greatly around the Muslim world. There are well over a billion of them and contrary to what you might think from TV not all of them are Arab or Persian. The word ""Sharia"" is analogous to the word ""justice"", it's a completely vague concept that can mean whatever you want it to mean, from a fair, equitable legal system to a vengeful ""eye for an eye"" one.

I still quite like Mario, he's had a few games earlier in the season before he picked up an injury. He impressed in his first appearance for us alongside Sturridge, but since then he's been expected to play the role of lone striker more often than not which doesn't suit his or the teams style of play. Since arriving he's found it hard going n front of goal and with our pressing game, but contradictory to what you may read in various media outlets he is trying and putting a shift in most times. I think if he can get a good run in the team and improve his confidence he'll eventually turn out to be a good player for us, we haven't had any issues with behavior really other than the silly picture which was wrongly taken as racist(*in my opinion*) I'm still yet to make a full verdict on him because I'm happy to give him a season or two to settle like any other new signing. I am looking forward to seeing him play alongside Sturridge again, and **hope** that it will propel us back into the top 4.",null,0,null,1420827237,null,0,false,0,cnjoh54,null,t3_2rvmzf,null,t1_cnjoh54,null,t3_2rvmzf,null,null,null,1424968780,null,30,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,30,null

You can write off certain expenses against the taxable amount, like the interest part of the mortgage, maintenance costs, letting agency fees etc but anything in rent beyond that will be taxed. If you are a basic rate that will be 20% if you are higher rate that will be 40%. That means it isn't quite as simple as letting the house pay for itself.

The other consideration is the time, costs and hassle of actually being a landlord. Have you really looked into this? What if you get a bad set of tenants that stop paying rent and trash the place? Are you prepared and able to go through the courts to evict them and do you have emergency funds available to cover repairs and/or the mortgage while no rent is being paid?

null,false,SamdyGray,null,null,null,"I'll preface this by saying that I am a financial planner.

Your relationship with your adviser seems to be formed on a ""product led"" basis. You ask him to make recommendations for suitable investments and once a year he tells you how well your investments have performed (or not). It may have started this way because that's how the adviser is used to working, or it may have been because that's how the adviser thought that you/your parents wanted to work.
 
I'm certainly not knocking this approach and it works well for people that want to work this way. However, in my opinion, people then get too focused on investment performance and the real objectives often get missed. Again, this is my opinion only and I'm prepared to get down-voted by the many people that don't necessarily see the benefit of having a good IFA, but an adviser/planner is really worth their salt when they are helping you toward real meaningful goals and not just telling you where to invest. The investment strategy should really be a by-product and secondary to *what you want to achieve* not necessarily ""how much growth can I get"". 

You say that you ""want to discuss what is happening with your money"" and also ""I am more concerned with maximising growth and minimising fees"". You need to make sure that your adviser understands your goals and objectives. Talk to him about what your plans and goals are. It may be that what you/your parents discussed with him when the investment originally started is no longer relevant. Things change over time and so should financial plans. It sounds as though you are not exactly clear about what your IFA is doing for you so don't be afraid to ask about the charging structure and what services you are getting for your money. Ask them if they'll work on a fixed fee basis rather than hourly.

It is, after all, *your money* so make sure that your adviser will work for you. If you don't think they're the right person to help with your needs, either manage your investments yourself (there's a lot of great help on this sub for that) or find another IFA that fits your needs and objectives better.",null,0,null,1420828118,null,0,false,0,cnjp0zt,null,t3_2ruiyh,null,t1_cnjp0zt,null,t3_2ruiyh,null,null,null,1424968522,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

I don't think anyone can be in doubt when they say Mario was a panic buy. We went in for Sanchez and failed because his wife wanted to be in London (aka: they gave him more money). We went in for Remy but apparently he had heart problems which didn't stop Chelsea buying him. And so we were stuck in the situation of Balotelli or Bony, I'm going to think the club thought they were on similar ability levels so lets be honest at the time who would excite the fans more, this worldwide name for £16m or Bony for £20m? (As well as the fact he would bring the madness Suarez left with)

We clearly needed a GK in the summer, at the very least a better backup, and got no one.

We needed goal scoring forwards and got Balotelli and Lambert, neither of whom were especially prolific from open play last season nor, as many have mentioned, really fit the way we play.

We needed a left back, got one.  Well done there.

We needed a CDM (either replacement or competition for Lucas depending on ones point of view), got no one (unless we consider Can that).

My SO and i park directly outside my house as to not cause problems and also for the safety of my car. 
How can a government which expects people to travel further and work longer, expect people not to drive?
Like someone has previously stated, the new build estates are terrible for parking and this is my problem. Why are the government allowing houses to be built that don't accommodate the working man &amp; woman. They want equal households, with everyone working but don't want people driving to work.

null,false,LFCCalgary,null,null,null,"I agree with you somewhat but what I'd say in response to this is that it's so much harder identifying targets that fit a narrow transfer policy. 

If we're looking only at young, promising individuals that are in a situation where they're likely to move to Liverpool you can't be too picky. 

Markovic is a good example where many people didn't see the need for him because he's not a striker. But he's young, not too expensive and very talented (and willing to come to Liverpool which is very important). Therefore you snap him up right away. 

Likewise you can look at our striker situation. Remy and Balotelli seemed to be the only ones that really fit our ""young and promising"" policy. Balotelli was a gamble that hasn't paid off. Remy didn't pass a medical. So what do you do now? We can't afford to splash money on anyone with a higher profile, and we bought a young promising striker(?) (or winger) in Origi. So what else can the club do honestly except plan for the future and hope we scrape by for now. 

Finding a young promising goalkeeper ready to play every game of a season is always going to be difficult. Unfortunately a midtable goalie like Mignolet is inevitable until we get lucky and strike gold.

Basically what I'm getting at is that the pool of players we can choose from is pretty small, therefore targeting positions we need to strengthen won't always work. You need to buy in positions you aren't desperate for because those players are available.

We played 007 Nightfire for about 10 hours that night, having tons of soda, chips,cookies, and shit load of candy. My friend and his little bro went home and a month later I got a call from my homie. He said that night we played 007, his little brother stuck 3 sour skittles up his nose and they got stuck DEEP. This kid was 7 at the time and he decided not to tell anyone... idk why... They found out A MONTH later cuz his boogers were blue/orange and his room smelled like sour milk... He had to go to the doctor to get them removed and the doctor said the skittles were all soggy and white cuz of his snot lolzzzzz

I can think of a few reasons why a stronger military might appeal to the more socially-conservative minded, but the most  interesting one is the difference in ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" approaches to problem solving and the unknown. Conservatives are more likely to approach the unknown with caution and trepidation, favouring solutions with a track record; liberals are less afraid of the unknown, and are more likely to approve of other solutions (treaties, international human rights, and non-proliferation agreements). If we could translate this into practical politics: *sure, we aren't at war with anybody now, but we don't know if we could still trust our neighbours in the future*.   

http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9292100

&gt;we argue that one organizing element of the many differences between liberals and conservatives is the nature of their physiological and psychological responses to features of the environment that are negative. Compared with liberals, conservatives tend to register greater physiological responses to such stimuli and also to devote more psychological resources to them.

We have a Northern Ireland Executive that still won't liberalise it libel legislation.

We have ritual and self-righteous rioting by people 'offended' by parading or flag decisions.

We have politician's offices firebombed and death threats issued for voting in ways that others find 'offensive'.

i.e. we should all wise up and realise, in the same way as the French muslim community should, that you possess no right at all not to be offended, and a free press and free speech is something to be highly valued and protected. 

All of us who claim civilisation on our side should defend these values against the bullies, intimidators and authoritarians that clearly continue to live in our midst, in Northern Ireland, on this subreddit and elsewhere.

I guess I'm just saying, for me, those 4 areas, promising forwards ready for the first team, a backup/competitor/better keeper than Mignolet, a starting LB, and a CDM as either competition or replacement for Lucas should have been priority one with the likes of Origi, Markovic, Lovren, Lallana, Can, Manquillo being of secondary importance.",null,0,null,1420830827,null,0,false,0,cnjqq16,null,t3_2rvpa3,null,t1_cnjqq16,null,t1_cnjpv5j,null,null,null,1424967720,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

We may see more defensive stability but at the cost of a link between midfield and attack. 

I'm not sure Bentaleb AND Mason is our best partnership, but having ONE of them in the side is really important because they use the ball faster than any of our other midfielders and they have more mobility. Capoue is an accomplished passer but I don't think he speeds our play up in the same way as Bentaleb and Mason.

I got new boots for christmas but they were too big,  so we had to send them back so they can process the exchange and send me back ones that fit.  First of all, they didn't send a return label with the boots so I had to go to UPS myself and pay like 25 bucks to send them back which they took a week to finally get to the soccer.com warehouse. Finally they get there last Friday (at least that's what it said on the ups tracking website) so I call on Saturday to ask how long it would take for them to send me back the new cleats and they said, they haven't received them yet, or they just haven't processed it yet. OK, fine. So I call back on Tuesday,  and ask to see what's the situation,  and they tell me that they just got there that morning(THAT'S NOT WHAT THE UPS TRACKING WEBSITE SAID YOU LYING PIECES OF SHIT). Then, they tell me that it will take 4-5 days to process the return(which is an extremely long time to process a simple return). Then the next day, they send an email to my mom,  saying that they don't have the size I asked for in the exchange,  but then I checked the website immediately,  and found the size, right there, in stock,  so we call back, AGAIN, and they finally put in another order for the boots, but there's no way I can track the order, so I'm not even sure if they did end up sending anything. 
Tl;dr soccer.com has fucked up my order for new boots and this whole shenanigan has been going on for like 3 weeks and I'm in dire need of new boots as the ones I have are barely holding up and i need them for training everyday.

The new licence rules are there to try and combat the issues. Once people are out of the danger zone as such then it should prevent the number of motorcyclist fatacs. You can argue until the cows come home about the fall out of A1/A2 changes. 

 
I had a 33bhp restriction (back in the day, slippers/pipe etc) and I'll tell you what I'd rather have had the 48bhp and retest rules. I taught myself and passed my test myself, I'm quite confident I could have done that with todays test and if you've been instructed once, redoing it should be a fairly academic point. Yes its annoying that you're limited to 94bhp but there are plenty of decent bikes out there that you actually can restrict.  Or you can get creative with some older bikes. 

I'm not saying its perfect. When I was restricted to 33bhp it was annoying as hell but there we go.

The waste pipe issue is a bit tricky as its probably fair on her side to ask for an experts opinion to say it has been fitted properly, you would have expected a plumber to come and fix it when you were living in it so if it did leak and damaged your belongs you would have been able to claim compensation, ask yourself how long can you guarantee your work for, if she has a flood after she moves in she could try a compensation claim against you if she is as nutty as you make her out to be.

This time last year is was clear that our first 11 was poised to attempt something remarkable, but what Rodgers really needed was a little bit of depth to be able to have an option from the bench. Were we really serious about trying to sign somebody? Nobody came in.

It's been clear for a while that neither of our goalkeepers is suitable for the kind of football we've been trying to play. We haven't acted, whilst Spurs and Man Utd have snapped up players who would have been good candidates to warm their benches.

Last season's success and near-glory was founded on the tireless running of two fast strikers; miraculously we were never missing both at once but we were painfully aware that there was no third string. We sold one, and didn't sign any similar players when it was clear we needed at least two (one to replace Suarez, one for backup/rotation).

We can sign young attacking midfielders by the dozen in the hope that 40% of them come good, but that can't be the whole of our transfer policy. If we don't even attempt to patch the clearing holes in our current squad, we can't succeed. And if we can't attain a level of success in the short term, the stars of the future who we are bringing through will leave for more ambitious clubs as they mature, rather than sticking around.

It's not about judging the young players who have been brought in, it's about the holes in the squad that haven't been addressed.

However this breeches Premier League rule T.11 as, according to what Man City publicly said, his initial contract date didn't end on 30/6/2015. T.11 wouldn't have applied if this was a loan.

Apparently Man City have now privately stated to the Premier League the deal WAS always a contract for the full year so there was no way Lampard would ever have gone to NYCFC on Jan 1st.

Origi was that, it's true, but we still needed another consistent plan A at striker given Sturridge's injury issues.

Yes you could get pulled over by a nasty horrible policeman like me (and one who knows a lot about motorcycles/motorcyclists and the rest of it) who then seizes your bike and sends you to court for driving otherwise in accordance with a licence and driving with no insurance and you'll either get 9 points or lose your licence if you've held a substantive licence for less than two years, and you'll have to do a re-test and pay through the nose for insurance for five years. But that might be the least of your worries. 

If you become involved in a collision and its your fault or determined to be your fault and your insurance company tests your bike and finds that it was not restricted they can decline to pay the damages (which can add up very quickly if you hit something expensive). Lets say you damage an expensive car and the repair bill/injuries claims amount to £25000 (which is not out of the ordinary) the owner of said vehicle could take you to civil court and you may have to pay the damages plus costs, which can become astronomical. Or your insurance company may pay out, happy days, right? No. They'll take you to court and recover costs from you for damages resulting from a breach of contract. So the end result is the same. Are you sure you've got enough money laying about to bail yourself out of that mess? I damn sure don't. Oh and the nasty policeman sending you to court, yeah that could still happen at this point. 

No the above doesn't happen all the time, its really quite rare. But for the sake of it, is it really worth it? You don't want to be that 1 in 1000 case. 

Another, rather grim consequence could be this. You die as a result of a motorcycle collision. We all know the risks. What if you have life insurance? What if your not around to provide for your family and then your life insurance doesn't cover you. Its the worst thing in the world when I turn up on your door step and say to your family "" There is no easy way for me to tell you this. I'm afraid its my sad duty to inform you that"" but then imagine that they can't put food on the table because you wanted to get your rocks off? Everything gets investigated at a fatal collision, even if it is only single vehicle. 

So yeah, the consequences can be worse than most people imagine. 

I'm actually not saying that I agree with the incensing system or that I believe that people should face the above consequences but that's the way it is. 

At the end of the day its for two years. If you love motorcycles then you'll ride for two years and you'll progress onto other things. I had to deal with a restriction when I started riding. (restricted CB500 for two years) and that was 33bhp. Now I ride a blade so you'll get there. Have patience. You'll be more glad your next bike for having been restricted anyway.

Granted they dropped the ball, but the timing doesn't change why they ultimately had to act.

&gt; Then they also announced that new anti-terrorism powers were needed in November so they pushed that through the Commons in a week as well.

That they did, but it's not had it's second reading in the Lords yet and the Government is likely to have a tough time at the committee stage:

http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/counterterrorismandsecurity.html

There is as yet no guarantee that it will even obtain the Royal Assent prior to the dissolution.

&gt;We can sign young attacking midfielders by the dozen in the hope that 40% of them come good, but that can't be the whole of our transfer policy. If we don't even attempt to patch the clearing holes in our current squad, we can't succeed. And if we can't attain a level of success in the short term, the stars of the future who we are bringing through will leave for more ambitious clubs as they mature, rather than sticking around.

I think you are blind to what actually happened this summer. The two positions that people always bring up are striker and keeper, as if those were the only places we needed to strengthen. In my opinion we needed to strengthen our fullbacks, center backs, and to a lesser extent defensive midfield as well. These three positions, in addition to striker and keeper, needed signings. The only position we didn't fill was the keeper. 

We signed two strikers.

We signed two fullbacks. 

We signed one center back. 

We signed one (potentially) defensive mid (in Can).

So really, besides needing a keeper, we signed players in every position that we needed. So now it is down to the magical 40% success rate that Tomkins is talking about. 

Unfortunately the signings that we could consider the biggest failures are in one of the most important positions that we needed to fill. 


&gt;It's not about judging the young players who have been brought in, it's about the holes in the squad that haven't been addressed.

The holes were addressed FOR THE MOST PART. It's just that the players brought in for some key positions haven't been a success, which is inevitable because one in every two signings (at a minimum) is deemed a failure.

My argument with the grass is that cutting it now could make it look worse, and I would then be liable for fixing damage I advised her may happen.

The pet clause in the AST stated we were responsible for the professional cleaning of the carpets at the end of the tenancy. We hired professional equipment and did it ourselves, rather than paying labour for someone else to do the exact same thing. I attempted to clarify if she meant a professional company or us doing it ourselves and she simply replied ""please follow the terms as set out in the tenancy"", so IMO that is not clear enough. 

She then followed up with a text message asking me, in the event that I had hired a professional company, to inspect the work myself before paying for it in case it did not meet her standards and I was required to complete it myself.

As for the plumbing, we simply replaced the sink drain/waste unit. It is hardly complex plumbing, one screw at the top and a plastic screw fitting at the bottom. I cannot guarantee she won't have an issue when she connects her washing machine, but then neither would a plumber, unless he fitted it himself.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as a comparison to the NSPA gel cleansers.

**Your opinion:** The price point is reasonable considering there is little water and no mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients. Fragrance is subtle and herbal, that and the packaging make it more unisex than the NSPA equivalents.

Less 'sticky' and more silky than the NSPA Skin Renewal Gel in my freezing winter bathroom.

Wrong.

[Matchday revenue, at £44.6M, made up more than 1/5 of our total revenue last year.](http://www.anfield-online.co.uk/lfc-news/2014/liverpool-fc-accounts-show-increase-commercial-revenue/)

Our profit before tax last year? Just -£49.8M is all. As in we lost £50m!

That means we lost more money last year than we brought in in matchday revenue.

So tell me again how matchday revenue is insignificant.

null,false,LFCCalgary,null,null,null,"&gt; I don't know.  I think finding a goal keeper better than Jones would have been quite easy, finding one better than Mignolet a bit more difficult.

Finding a keeper ""better than Jones"" is setting the bar pretty low. You're implying that if we had bought a keeper WORSE than Mignolet, but better than Jones that even some of our problems would be partially solved? That would just be one more signing for people to complain about as a ""failure"". 

&gt;Finding a forward who looks promising would have been easy, although admittedly there is no guarantees and near anyone might well have had similar return to two we ended up buying.

""Would have been easy..."" ""No guarantees..."" You are conflicting here. One could argue that Balotelli looked promising. Also you forget we signed Origi, who does look promising. 

&gt;I guess I'm just saying, for me, those 4 areas, promising forwards ready for the first team, a backup/competitor/better keeper than Mignolet, a starting LB, and a CDM as either competition or replacement for Lucas should have been priority one with the likes of Origi, Markovic, Lovren, Lallana, Can, Manquillo being of secondary importance.

Here you imply that signing those 6 players you name somehow stopped us from signing a good keeper and striker, but there's no evidence of that. Had a good young promising keeper/striker become available we *probably* would have been in for them. But obviously none came available that the committee deemed worth going for. And we did buy a starting left back, Moreno! And we did buy a CDM for competition with Lucas, Can!

Ideally, it would be someone clearly better than Mignolet or less ideally at around the same level, but there is no rationale in my mind for spending the kind of money we did and at the very least not getting someone better on the bench as backup.

I would argue Balotelli was and is a poor striker.  I've argued it so much I've been asked to stop arguing it.  So, I'll leave it there.  He's not at all what we needed and I can't for the life of me so why we bought him.  Terrible decision.  Origi is a kid.  He looks promising, sure, but he's nowhere near PL ready and by the time he is his contract will be near enough up.  Another poor decision by the club.

I'm saying that the areas I mentioned should have been the focus.  Everything else should have been secondary and if we fulfilled the primary needs, great, go blow £25M or whatever on a Lallana, but until those needs were met it should have been 100% the focus of everyone on the committee and within the scouting system to find those players and bring them in.

* So to sign someone keeping a £30m striker out of the Belgium team, despite being younger, makes sense to me, no matter whether fate decrees that he succeeds or fails. **(Remember, Origi is as prolific as Thierry Henry at the same age.)**

* ...Markovic is starting to show that he’s a class act, but like many new recruits he has taken time to settle **(some settle quickly, others don’t; so never write anyone off within the first year, especially youngsters)**.

* [Benitez] specialised in signing 22-year-olds, not 26-year-olds. **(Indeed, having researched Bob Paisley’s signings a few years back, I noted that the average age was also around 22.)** Indeed, Rafa’s transfer record was excellent until he started buying players supposedly more ready-made in terms of age (Keane and Aquilani). Keane was a proven Premier League goalscorer who just couldn’t cut it in red.

* ...less than half of all transfers work; around 40% being successful on average, but you could round it up to 50% if being generous.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Labour (if you are too, check out /r/LabourUK!)",null,"&gt;There's the same moveable goalposts for the Green Party though.

They're not moveable. Ofcom clearly say that they're taking multiple facts into account, looking at historical results, current representation in government at all levels *and* current polling. The Greens have neither the past success of the Lib Dems, nor the current high polling of Ukip, and so are not considered for inclusion as a major party.

In detail:

&gt;The last General election

Their were three 'major parties' at the last General Election, all of whom polled over 20% of the vote. The Greens and Ukip were of course nowhere near this level but, while the Greens managed to win a seat, they were seventh in terms of share of the vote, behind Ukip, the BNP and the SNP. In other words, despite standing in England and Wales, the Greens were unable to outpoll a party that stands in an area of the country with an electorate of around five million, even when that party did not come first in that region.

The Greens won 0.9% of the votes, compared with Ukip's 3.1%, so if we're considering share of the votes as a measure of past electoral performance, Ukip are the clear winner. But that's not all we're considering.

&gt;Liberal Democrats

The Lib Dems' current low polling (around the same level as the Greens) doesn't get them knocked out of 'major party' status because they have 50+ MPs and have historically showed high levels of support (by 'historically' we of course mean 'up to and including the last General Election'). Of course, if you believe that the Greens' polling figures mean they're a major party, you must accept the same of the Lib Dems, making the rest of your argument regarding the Lib Dems moot.

Whatever their current polling, the Lib Dems have elected representatives in Westminster and in the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments, on the GLA and in the European Parliament, and large numbers of local councillors. They are the third largest party in the House of Lords. Even the direst predictions for the next election suggests they will have ~30 MPs in the House of Commons, rather more than the Greens.

And, if none of that convinces you, the Lib Dems are also - you may remember - currently *literally part of the government* and, therefore, very much a major party.

&gt;Ukip's MPs.

Whether or not an MP defected is irrelevant especially since both Ukip MPs were re-elected in byelections: They faced the electorate and won. They have two MPs to the Greens' one.

You've also conveniently ignored the last European elections, where Ukip came first and the Greens fourth.

Now, I've always been in favour of including other parties in the debates but that's not what this is about. This consultation is simply about which parties should be accorded 'major party' status. It sets out multiple criteria and finds that, while Ukip and the Lib Dems fall short for some of those criteria (historical support and current polling, respectively) the Greens fall short in *all* those criteria. So the Greens cannot be considered a major party for this election. This is in no way a reflection on the views of the Greens or their members, or the quality of their leaders and representatives.",null,0,null,1420840508,null,0,1420840699,0,cnjwo3n,null,t3_2rqehh,null,t1_cnjwo3n,null,t1_cnib0oq,null,null,null,1424964945,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Pro's.     
1/ The school has started a fresh Ofsted record.    
2/ Promises of more investment.

Cons.    
1/ It will be hard to benchmark the school and do anything about failings as it will have started an Ofsted record. The first new Ofsted might be years away.   
2/ There is now a compulsory uniform policy at our school and the uniform can only be purchased though a single supplier named by the academy.    
3/ Existing staff and teachers have had their contracts rewritten. The academy will nominate all suppliers (dinners, equipment ect) with out transparency.    
4/ Half the governing body were sacked and the remaining governors have very much curtailed powers and they have no say in how the school is run any more.  They are there as a legal requirement only.        
5/ There appears to be nothing you can do regarding broken promises made by the academy to the school or parents as everything becomes very corporate and contractual. Get everything said at the meeting in writing / record the consultation meeting.    
6/ Teaching staff will no longer be required to be able to teach or have passed a teaching qualification.  As a plumber you can apply for a job as head of Maths.

My gut feeling is that by the time you get to a consultation meeting, its a done deal.  There is no consultation to be had.  Time will tell academically what effect this change has on the kids at my school, although if they stick to a recognised curriculum things can't get too bad I guess.  

The questions I would ask at the meeting though is that as the academy gets the free hold for the school and its grounds - what protection is there against them selling a lease hold or renting out part of the grounds.  I would also make a point of asking them how you can sack the academy and change providers if they do not preform as expected with in say two years.  Answerers to both these questions have not been forthcoming so far.

TL/DR Its a scam, there is nothing you can do about it but the only real effect I have seen so far is being forced to buy new overpriced substandard uniform.

You are right in the sense that so far I have had no aims/objectives for the money, and, to a certain extent, I still don't. This money has been sat (growing) for a number of years while I was underage and then at university. I have never needed to touch the money and for that reason it is sat there just growing.

The same can be said for my father; he bought our family home in the early 90s after the crash and has a high salary, no mortgage, and will have a very generous pension. The money is unneeded (other than as an insurance against dementia or something similar which may require years of expensive care) and doesn't really have any goals.

If I had a set goal (I.e. Buying property asap) then I could act accordingly, but, being 22 and with little idea of what I will do with my life, all I need is growth and the ability to liquidate within a couple of years if I need to. This is something I will talk to my IFA about and see if he can give me any guidance

What is the difference between fixed fee/hourly? As I understand it he takes a fee (%) out of new products which are opened. This is normal, yes? My other concern is that their man's firm is quite upmarket and (I expect) comparatively expensive. I have no idea if this is justified for my position in life and I don't know if it's worth it for me. How would I go about asking this? I know it is my money but I want to be tactful.

Scored 3 lucky goals against QPR in the only time our offense has looked potent at all, minus West Ham. Got absolutely fucked over at City but I'm seeing that that was the last match you saw.

Oh yeah, look up Jelavic's goal from the Hull 2-0. Watch as Barry **literally does not move** as he plays Jelly onside by a mile, then watches him stroll past.

Been pretty negative around here, honestly you picked the wrong time to leave! 

My shining light*: Mo Besic looks pretty good, lot of potential, but he's been playing with Barry (shite) as McCarthy's been out. Baines actually looked pretty good in midfield (a la Lahm) at Newcastle. Great assist to Mirallas. 

Overall: shite, shite, and more shite. Everybody's hoping that we bottomed out at Hull and that this late Rom equalizer (he looked really good the whole match btw) will lift us out of the funk. Unfortunately it's City next, so not a whole lot to hope for there, more looking forward to the replay on Tuesday. Let's fucking win that, how about.

[Leaving Berlin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21943244-leaving-berlin), a spy thriller set in 1949 east Berlin , quite interesting about a period I didn't know much about in a city I love (lived there in the 80s and regularly visit now)

null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; GM crops may cross-breed with wild varieties or wild species and transfer genes to other plants, posing a long-term threat to wildlife and biodiversity.

What possible threat do they pose? Can you cite anything to support this policy, or is this typical [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)?

&gt;Herbicide-resistant genes have been transferred to other plants, creating ‘super weeds’.

This happens with *any* herbicide, not just GM-based ones. Are you applying this policy to *all* herbicides, or are you just singling out GM-based ones?

&gt;Herbicides used with GM crops have been shown to harm both wildlife and human health.

You know the LD50 for glyphosate is ridiculous, right? The LD50 for vinegar is worse. Same with salt. Harm caused by it comes in doses far higher than you could expect to come across. Many other pesticides, including ones used on organic crops, are far more toxic to humans (Copper Sulphate has to be limited because it leaves concentrations of heavy metals in the soil). Are these getting the same treatment, or are you again singling out GM crops for totally-not-political-reasons?

&gt;GM crops undermine organic and conventional farming through cross-contamination and by creation of resistant pests.

Nonsense. This is FUD again. This is not a problem in America, where GM crops are widely used. Wheat pollen dispersal is very limited. Rapeseed pollen will rarely travel further than 50 metres. Why don't you suggest minimum distances between GM crops and others instead of a ~~ban~~ ""moratorium""?

&gt;The use of GM crops in poor countries has proved disastrous to farming communities.

Absolute unsubstantiated bollocks. This is the sort of horseshit that Vandanda Shiva tries to pass off.

&gt;Despite widespread introduction of GM foods in the United States and elsewhere, the potential dangers of GM foods to human health have not been properly investigated and risks remain considerable.

So just to clarify, the Green Party denies the [global scientific consensus on GM food safety](http://files.vkk.me/images/cce3cffc1f2013113a84723ec6929436375d10e1.jpg)? Because that's what you're doing here. The idea that the ""risks remain considerable"" is an absolute lie. Remember how I said that the Greens' approach to GM is akin to UKIP's approach to man-made climate change? This is why: You're denying the widely accepted, decades-old global scientific consensus for political reasons.

Had my bike (&lt;1 month old, £600) locked up outside a friends house on a quiet road in stoke newington and after three hours I came back to find the handlebars &amp; stem stolen. Three bolts loosened and four cables snipped was all it took. It cost me £170 to replace the parts. The worst part is that I later found my shifters for auction on ebay, but since I had no way of definitively proving that they were mine, there was ""nothing that [the police] could do"". (I knew they were mine as they had a single *unique* scratch on them, where I had fallen over earlier that day.. (I'd just fitted my first cleats :S))

I then set upon finding a foolproof anti-theft system. There are products on the market specifically for this purpose (as have been linked in this thread), however they tend to be &gt;20x more expensive than the standard component which I'm not too keen on. People have suggested things like gluing a ball bearing into the socket, but obviously this makes it much more difficult for me to disassemble the bike too; again, not too keen on that idea. I decided that the best course of action would be to replace each and every hex-head bolt with a [security bolt](http://www.zeroplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/long-security-fasteners.png), in the assumption that no petty thief would carry around an entire set of security drivers. As it happens, its not all that easy to purchase them except in bulk, though I'm sure you can find what you're looking for if you look long/hard enough. I'm now at uni in Bath so there's little need for security beyond a chain and padlock, but if i were still living in London I'd definitely invest in some security fasteners.

In short, no. Except maybe the grass...it depends.

If she can't prove the property was not clean, and you believe it was clean, she must be lying. Or she is an unreasonable person and has found one cat hair in the otherwise spotless house and is now expecting a big payout for it.

If you tell her about the fence and she doesn't respond that is her fault, it is her responsibility to fix the fence anyway. I have had fence panels broken by the wind and my landlord replaced them with new ones and fitted them himself for no charge, as it is his responsibility.

Replacing the waste on the sink is well within the realm of reasonable DIY repair for a tenant to undertake without needing a professional seal of approval. She should be thanking you for spending your own money and time fixing the problem.

How long is the grass? If it looks messy (moreso than when you moved in) then she has a point, if it looks normal then she is being unreasonable. How much does she want to charge for it?

At the check out, don't sign anything *unless you totally completely agree that is factual*. That is the point of signing, it is agreement. If you don't agree you don't sign. No matter what she says, it is *not* to sign just to say that it has taken place.

If I were you, I would write her a letter and give it to her before the check-out happens, and allow her to read it. If she still has problems then you simply let her keep the letter and refuse to sign anything. Then you refuse to agree to any unreasonable deductions (you have to agree before she can take any of *your* money).

Good luck!

On another note, i agree with what your saying on certain streets around the UK. My parents street is a nightmare, and although cars don't use the footpath, if they did it would make walking up and down the street a nightmare. 
This is my whole point, if the footpath is wide enough to accommodate both and also make driving down the street safer, why should it be stopped?

The second time around, they sent important-looking letters and such, and after a while sent me a ['Letter Before Action'](http://i.imgur.com/uATFSaW.jpg), letting me know that unless the made-up amount of £100 was paid, court proceedings would begin. I did some research online, and found that this is common practice and people who ignore the parking company's letters entirely end up ignoring this one as well. Which can lead to not turning up for a court date and getting the CCJ. Long story short, there are very well-defined rules that a 'Letter Before Action' should adhere to, and parking companies never do. So I wrote them a polite letter to let them know that I was completely willing to defend the matter in court, but only if they'd send an LBA that complied with the law. They didn't bother, oddly enough...

&gt;Better than Jones should have been the bare minimum requirement in the summer.  Ideally, it would be someone clearly better than Mignolet or less ideally at around the same level, but there is no rationale in my mind for spending the kind of money we did and at the very least not getting someone better on the bench as backup.

Yes I agree, signing a keeper was the one position that we didn't buy. But honestly last season Mignolet was not nearly as bad as he has been this season. In my eyes a keeper was not a priority this past summer, but it has become one since then. Obviously those at the club agreed with me.

&gt;I would argue Balotelli was and is a poor striker.  I've argued it so much I've been asked to stop arguing it.  So, I'll leave it there.  He's not at all what we needed and I can't for the life of me so why we bought him.  Terrible decision.  

I know you claim to know for a fact that this signing was going to fail before it ever happened and I don't know how to argue with that. You couldn't have known for a fact that Balotelli would fail. Obviously some thought he'd be a success and it hasn't worked out that way. This is addressed in the article, he is one of the ""60%ers"".

&gt;Origi is a kid.  He looks promising, sure, but he's nowhere near PL ready and by the time he is his contract will be near enough up.  Another poor decision by the club.

Now you are getting ridiculous. A poor decision? Would you have said the same about signing a 15 year old Raheem Sterling? You judge everything in hindsight and have absolutely no foresight. This was a good decision, full stop. 

&gt;I'm saying that the areas I mentioned should have been the focus.  Everything else should have been secondary and if we fulfilled the primary needs, great, go blow £25M or whatever on a Lallana, but until those needs were met it should have been 100% the focus of everyone on the committee and within the scouting system to find those players and bring them in.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think you're trying to say that these other signings we made somehow stopped us from getting a quality striker or a quality keeper. Where is the evidence that a player in these positions of the quality that you need to deem them a success was available and that we didn't go after them? 

If we had focused all our attention on Sanchez, Remy and  lets say Lloris, and not make any other signings until those were done, where would we be now, when those transfers inevitably end up falling through? We'd have no signings at all. 

&gt;Whether Can is a CDM or not is debatable.  I don't have a problem with him, seems a decent player, but I wouldn't say he is really (at this point in his career) proper competition or an improvement on Lucas, which is more what was needed.

Again you are missing the point of the article. Signing a player capable of walking straight into the starting XI is extremely difficult in our situation. We need to target younger players that will take time to bed in. Can is exactly that. 

You have unfair expectations for the transfer committee. You expect them to be near perfect when that has been shown to be impossible. 

We are *trying to* set ourselves up for success in the future because to sustain the success we had last season would be impossible with our finances. On Twitter, Tomkins has said as much, that a league title challenge every five years or so *may* be possible but we will never challenge every year with the league rules and FFP as they are now. What we did last year was essentially a miracle.

The current Ofsted grade is outstanding and has been since 2005, this isn't being forced on them like some schools, but the fact the governing body seems willing to choose what others are forced to do makes me suspicious.  

5/9 of the schools the sponsor is currently involved with were already improving before they decided to become academies in 2013. 2/9 stayed at the same grade on the previous two inspections, and the last couple, one went from outstanding to good, the other from good to inadequate.  We would be their only outstanding school unless there are other schools joining them too.


The school has a huge piece of undeveloped land that is maintained by the local authority at the moment. It is gated separately to the rest of the school and has a separate access road.

When it says that you're taking advantage of interest, it means interest rates attached to a high-interest current account, not the interest rate on the ISA.

- over 360 days (or however close you get to a full year) your money is earning 3%, 5%, whatever your high interest current account pays

- then, for 5 days it earns a low rate of interest (5 days at 1.5% annual interest is negligible in terms of actual payout) *but* this has the advantage that it's now in a tax-free ISA which will roll over to the next year. If you have, say, £25k to save, you can't put all £25k in an ISA in the same year because of the limit. But you are allowed to put £15k in on March 31st (assuming you put nothing in up til that point) and then another £10k into the ISA in April.

What about that says- 'Hey, we need open play goals to replace Suarez.  Let's go sign this guy!'  Balotelli has never been overly prolific on the actual pitch and two teams have decided to move him on for the same or less than they paid for him.  It wasn't a calculated risk, it was completely idiotic and a massive waste of money in a situation where we couldn't afford to screw up.

Origi is a poor decision, no way around it.  He adds nothing to the team NOW, which is when we needed it most.  He signed a five year deal, meaning we get him for three (from the ages of 20-23) before he runs into his last year on his current deal.  I personally don't seem him having much impact for at least another season and what do you think will happen if he starts to come good and has one year left on his contract?  We might make a fair bit of money on selling him on (which is good), but we're unlikely to see the best of him in our side.  Again, if we've achieved our primary objectives and now have 3-4 good, solid-looking goal scorers in the side, then fine, buy Origi.  But you have to meet the primary objective first.

They did stop us from getting players.  Why do you think we're not doing anything in the market now?  It's not because we've got a load of money left to spend but don't feel like it.  There's only so much to go around and we blew it all in the summer and things we didn't need.  Brendan/the committee were like kids in the candy store, picking out their favorite treats.  Sure, the treats are generally tasty, but they weren't what was required.  Are the signings we made bad players?  No.  Are they what we needed?  No.

I don't expect the committee to be perfect at all.  They could have well bought the exact players many wanted to see and those players could have well flopped massively, but what they didn't do was buy what we needed and I really don't see how you can't see that.

I understand completely the financial constraints and I agree with Tomkins wholeheartedly on it- expecting much better than around 5th is stupid and it's just reality.  That said, like I said previously, if we had got the summer right we could be pushing for 3rd or 4th, but we got it well wrong and are going to have a tough time even pushing for our 'natural' spot of 5th because of it.",null,0,null,1420844828,null,0,false,0,cnjz48p,null,t3_2rvpa3,null,t1_cnjz48p,null,t1_cnjymky,null,null,null,1424963673,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

City, on the other hand, did get dinged for violating FFP, although in the future they probably won't have an issue as they've built up their base (similar to Chelsea) and can simply sell assets every once in a while for a fair chunk of money (they have a lot of players worth quite a lot of money) if add'l revenue is needed to offset future player acquisitions.

The short version is most of the spend of those two (less so City, more so Chelsea) came before FFP, so they amassed an massive squad worth massive amounts of money.

He's just 100% the wrong kind of player for us and I think most anyone who watched him with any degree of criticality would say the same.  We needed players who can play wide or central, Mario can't.  We need players who can run behind defenses, Mario doesn't.  We need players who work hard defensively, Mario hasn't.  Etc, etc.  

I don't know how Origi is going to play out, that's just my best guess.  He's too expensive to be in the U-21s but not good enough to be in the first team and won't be for a little while yet.  That's all.  We needed someone good enough, he isn't it, although I will say that at least he fits the profile of the type of players we should have been looking at, we just needed the ones that have more experience than he does.

I'm not saying it's easy, as you're correct, it's not.  What it is easy to do is see 'we need goals from open play' and 'we need another keeper' then also see that Lambert and Balotelli are not going to get you those based on their recent history nor is their play style really a great fit for us and that Mignolet is not the sort of keeper who is good with the ball at his feet which is something we expect our keepers to be doing often.

St Werbergs via the back of the city farm up to the big telecom tower you can see from the motorway, lost of nice undiscovered lanes and odd things to see. Then round the back of the old mental hospital (yellow building on a hill again seen from M32) then cross M32 and up to Frenchay hospital, hang a right just before it and you will get to the start of a lovely walk along the river Frome that will bring you out at Eastville park and then head home.

We often did the rout from Glos rd to and around the Downs, over the suspension bridge, Through Ashton court up round the deer park leaving the park at the bottom by the ring road. Round the harbour side, then back through town and then home through stokes croft. Bothe these walks are around 10 miles.

Get the train to Shirehampton, head to the high street and out towards Avonmouth, Just as your leaving all the shops hang a right and you will get to the bottom edge of a huge embankment all signposted as public walkway, its a bit of a hike up bonce you get to the top your level with the tower block roofs and have an amazing view over both sides. Walk along that ridge and keep going, it brings you out in Blaze Castle, keep to the high ground and walk to the manor house, and then drop down into the valley and keep following it all the way back to Sea mills. You can then walk along the river Avon footpath for a few miles before it brings you up to walk the last mile along the Port way back to town. If you still feel energetic when you get to the suspension bridge you can then walk up one of the steep paths on either side and then back home through Clifton. this is about 15 miles though but a great walk.

Last one is up through Clifton and then down the steep hill to the Cumberland basin, over the river Avon and follow it along the railway path until you can see the end of the Avon gorge on the opposite side of the river, there is then a tunnel that leads up into Leigh woods. Walk all round Leigh woods, across to Ashton court around the woods there and then back over the suspension bridge and home via the downs. This is also a long walk depending how much of the woods you walk in.

Spring and summer is great for these of course. But we get properly into night hiking last year and are starting up again. Leave at around 6pm on a week day this time of year and get back around 9-10.

I'm going to preface this with saying I lived and died with Lampard, especially when he hit his stride in 03/04, never looked back, and absolutely went super nova under Mourinho and on.  His match tying goal v Portugal in extra time in the 2004 Euro and then the team's eviscerating loss on pens were a swath of emotions I'll be talking about for years to come...

That said, if that quote I cited is to be believed (and I really want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt) Lampard is incredibly stupid or naive or a little of both.

That other one you linked though, whilst I appreciate the guy was joking, it's in very bad taste and very dodgy territory. The police have to investigate it, and despite the intent it could be taken as a threat.  If they had let it slide and then a bomb was exploded we'd all be asking why they didn't respond to it.

I know the laws are daft, and I wish that at times they weren't necessary, I really am a proponent of free speech (up to the point that it harmful or abusive etc), but it just highlights that we have a social responsibility to be thoughtful of how we communicate, especially now when so much of what we think and say is posted publicly for the entire world to see.

null,false,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,null,"&gt; I think you are blind to what actually happened this summer. 

Then you're not reading.

My point is that the signings we did make - the focus of the Tomkins article - is only part of the story.

We signed static, back-to-goal type strikers, fullbacks, a centre back, a utility player and an attacking midfielder. I'm not talking about them. Tomkins dealt with that adequately.

What we failed to do was sign a keeper, somebody who could replace Suarez, and somebody who could cover for/rotate with Sturridge and the Suarez replacement.

&gt;The holes were addressed FOR THE MOST PART. 

Apart from the goalkeeper and the type of striker we had success with previously, which were the actual holes we had. Those are the positions where we were shortest.

We had plenty of full-backs, although I think Moreno and Manquillo are both good players. We could also have used Kelly or Wisdom in a central position, I don't think we needed to prioritise a new central defender. We did need to add depth in midfield. But the most obvious problems were the keeper, replacing Suarez and adding depth up front as we knew Sturridge wouldn't be able to play 90 minutes twice a week for a whole season.. 

&gt;inevitable because one in every two signings (at a minimum) is deemed a failure.

Right, nearly one in two signings will be a success. But we didn't sign any goalkeepers at all. We didn't sign any strikers who can play in the way Sturridge and Suarez did last season at all. The success rate, whether it's 40, 50 or 60%, doesn't matter if you don't even make any signings in that position.

Becuase it isn't realistic to be honest, we extremely struggle to sign big players because we're not the attractive option like we once were and we're not going to throw money at players like other teams do.

&gt;It's great to be hopeful and positive. Why not get excited and enthusiastic while discussing these things instead of being so negative.

It is, most supporters were hopeful and positive last season and before the beginning of this season, but trying to remain hopeful and positive after seeing the club continously make error after error this season is difficult.

&gt;Sure, Mr. Rodgers has said it's difficult for LFC to sign big name players, but honestly I don't see why anyone would want to sign with a club that even the fans have such little faith in.

A clubs supporters is the last thing a player cares about before joining a club, despite what they might say in interviews. Money and chance of success are more important.

&gt;Seems like a lot of people are maybe trying to be humble and honest but it is coming across extremely cynical and douchebagerous (made that word up myself).

Likewise, being hopeful and positive while oblivious about the reality of the situation we're in come across as delusional. 

&gt;Why not entertain these fantasies -- it might actually do us some good. We do need some optimism and hope, otherwise we will be the dullest fans around.

Again, it comes across as delusional.

&gt;Let us dream, at least. :)

Performances from last season is what should make us dream, not scenarios we make up in our head.

I'm sure that will reply to you also, but IFAs are able to choose the basis on which they charge you.

If they charge you 1% and you have £100,000 invested, then that costs you £1,000 a year. If they charge you £100 an hour then you might get the same advice for only 5 hours work (£500).

I have to say I haven't looked into pricing myself yet, so these estimates may be off. I don't know if hourly-rate IFAs charge for prep time, but I'm sure you can appreciate the principle from that example I just gave.

One particular concern about percentage-based IFAs is that the payment structure may incentivise them to favour investments which pay them more over the investment that's actually best for you.

I don't know what percentages IFAs normally take (I *think* it's around 1%), but I used to do some work for an IFA who sold mortgages, and he was anything but independent. All he cared about was making the sale and pocketing his commission - all his punters were quite happy with him, but I guess I now see him as having preyed on the financially illiterate.

On a point of principle, I won't pay professionals on a commission basis, and I shall be seeking an IFA who'll work on an hourly rate. I believe this is the usual recommendation of this subreddit. I want someone who can sit there, dish his advice and wisdom and has nothing to gain or lose from the transaction. 

This subreddit tends to favour the ""[boglehead approach](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy)"" - if you google the term you'll find a bunch more resources.

I think you seriously overestimate what £30,000 can do. I mean, if you just hand that out, let's say in nice little bundles of a grand, which is enough to really impact somebody's life, then that's only 30 people. Not ""so many"". 

Anyway, that's not the point, the point was this:

&gt;I cannot figure out the mentality of the kinds of people who would actually pay for, or be able to pay for, something like this.

Ok, I don't know you, but let's say you work for the national median wage which is £26,500 ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare)). That gives you a yearly take home pay of £20,974.72 ([source](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php)).

I was going to say ""Let's assume you live in London"" but that'd be [laughably unaffordable if we're working exclusively with averages](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-2708201/Renting-London-unaffordable-average-month-rent-soars-1-412.html). So let's say you live outside the capital where your yearly rent, on average will be £8328. You now have £12646 left to spend on bills, groceries and yourself. I'm going to use the law of ""it's late and I'm out of fucks"" to guesstimate an average monthly outgoing, for a fairly frugal person who owns a second hand car of about £400. What's left for pure ""disposable"" income is £7846 when all is said and done.

Now for a whole year, that's not a heck of a lot. Because you're saving to (eventually) scrape together enough to buy a house, and you have that student loan debt to pay off, and your laptop is getting old and it'd be nice to buy a newer one. Then there's Christmas and going on holiday and nights out, and your best mate's birthday, and dates, &amp;etc. &amp;etc. And at the end of it all, it'd be good going to scrape together a couple of grand for your savings.

The average *yearly* salary in India is [just over a grand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_India).

There are (depending on how you measure) [40 countries with worse nominal yearly income than India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita).

Even what disposable income you have could help somebody somewhere. So why don't you?

You see, all there is to understand is that this is a difference in scale. If you have £2000 of disposable income in the bank, £200 seems like a reasonable treat for yourself. £30,000 seems like an unimaginable fortune. If you have £3,000,000 in the bank, £30,000 seems like a reasonable treat to yourself, and you have to start looking at the GDP of entire nation states to be dazzled by fortune.",null,0,null,1420854708,null,0,false,0,cnk48hz,null,t3_2rule3,null,t1_cnk48hz,null,t1_cnjt34z,null,null,null,1424961285,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

PS.  As for the match, I think it will hurt us that both Bentaleb and Mason will be out.  I really don't want to see a Dembele/Paulinho combo in the middle... AVB conclusively proved during his reign that they don't work together.

Assuming Capoue is still frozen out in Siberian exile, I'd rather Stambouli partner Dembele, or even changing up our formation to play a more attacking diamond midfield with Dembele at the base, Eriksen up top, Townsend and Chadli out wide, and then Soldado and Kane together up front, perhaps with the latter playing between midfield and Bobby.

Obviously there are multiple factors, but there is a LOT of walking/ very slow jogging done in soccer. As a striker, walking while a play is developing is often done before a sprint into open space.

Regardless, I'm not saying that American Football is the same as soccer. However, I've heard this ""soccer is a marathon"" malarkey often, and it's simply not. Soccer is a mix of jogging/walking and sprinting. I would say that an athlete trained at the 200/400m distance would carry the ideal conditioning for a midfield player.

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"That's not how the world works in reality though.

What you're basically saying here is the equivalent of saying ""We need to only invest in the stock market on stocks which go up in value"". It's not wrong, but it's also not something you can just agree upon doing and put into practice.

Players are an investment. Like any investments you need a portfolio and a spread, or you're basically just rolling a dice and hoping for the best. If you only go for high-risk talent then you'll consistently pay over the odds for players and miss out on cheaper options (Hyypia or Kuyt), and if you only go for players who are definitely great value then you'll miss out on every single transfer where another club is prepared to risk a bit more money on them. 

The whole point of things like TPI and Tomkin's Law is that it points out how *all clubs* are relatively shit at transfers. It's not as easy as just saying ""well if all clubs are shit we just need not to be shit"" - there's an inherent unpredictability and risk in buying and valuing players, and that risk is reflected in the number of transfers that pay off. 

For every £10m we spend on a Borini, there's £10m on a Coutinho or a Sturridge. For every £3m on a gem like Hyypia there's a £3m on a Bernard Diomedé (who played 2 games for us and that was it). That's just *how transfers work*, and it's how it works regardless of club. It's how any ""trying to predict the potential future value of a thing and how much it's worth paying for right now"" works.

There's an uncertainty on things like:

* The player's current potential (because scouting can only give you so much)
* The player's future potential
* The player's likelihood to actually fulfil his future potential
* Injuries
* What all of the above add up to in terms of his estimated value right now in the current market climate
* How much the current club is prepared to sell for
* How many other clubs are competing for the same player on price

And all of that is reflected in the signings of any top club. There's no club in the PL that has achieved consistent long-term success by consistently spending better, just clubs that have by consistently spending *more*.  

What fans do is cherry-pick in hindsight which transfers they thought would be shit before we signed them, and then lament that the club didn't realise a player was crap before we could have possibly known for sure he was crap. People remember the ""I knew he'd be shit and he was"" and conveniently ignore the players like Mascherano or Sturridge who were massively doubted by fans before they played for us and showed what they could do.

Lastly, did he deliberately go to Man City? I don't think so. He could've directly gone to Man City rather than NYCFC. And as the manager of NYCFC says that the decision was made by parent company so he was being professional with that -

&gt;I know small business owners who were forced out of business as a direct result of Labour policies, and lets not forget the heavy erosion in civil liberties that was ushered in under the ""something must be done"" mantra of Anti-Terror Laws, etc.

Which policies? New Labour was desperate to do everything possible for business, it facilitated employment, lowered the corporate tax bill and prevented the entire economy from diving in 2008. Anyway, you're probably talking about the global recession that hit literally every country in the west - would we have avoided it if we had George Osborne ""I'll match Gordon Brown's budget pound-for-pound"" or ""we need to encourage risk taking"" michael howard or the plethora of Tory MPs that were lobbying for less financial oversight from the FSA?

If the enemies that face us wish to employ cowardly tactics such as these then we have little option other than to take the opportunities that come. The Taliban, the Iraqi Insurgents and ISIS all have or had propaganda techniques. According to them, every single drone strike or air strike or missile strike kills civilians and nothing but civilians. According to our news sources, civilians are never killed, only ""militants"" or ""terrorists""

It is foolhardy to assume that what we do is in any way forgivable if even one civilian is killed by it, deliberately or not. However, this point also works in reverse, our enemies deliberately target civilians.

Especially because surely the real question is, do people beleive and practice those things? 

The Bible says a lot of crazy stuff, do you attack *all* Christians and assume they *all* beleive every single word? I mean criticse them for picking and choosing what to believe but it is just dumb to ignore their actual actions and assume they follow the word of the bible to the letter. I'm not asking about Christianity being ""better"" or your opinion or anything, answer that simple question, do you beleive that all Christians follow the word of the Bible and every holy figure to the letter? 

Surely, unless you actually believe in god, religion is just stuff people have came up with. It's not a fixed thing. So one man's Islam is completely different to anothers? Is one of them not a ""real"" muslim? That kind of thinking is exactly what fundamentalists do!

Fundamentalists are called fundamentalists for a reason. In any religion. Because it isn't considered normal to literally follow and believe.

Would also make the point that last season we finished 2nd and Spurs finished 6th. If you go back five years then you're halfway through the 2009/10 season where we ultimately finished 7th and Spurs were 4th. And for all their bridging the gap from ""almost top 4"" to ""actually top 4 sometimes"", Spurs still have considerably less silverware than we do from the same period. 

And Arsenal have got a good net spend in the last five or ten years in comparison to us, but then ten years ago they had a squad capable of going the entire PL season without losing a game. Really they've just done a good job of keeping an already good squad ticking over without having to squander money in the process.

If you look at our spending in comparison to other clubs, and consider that really we haven't had a squad that looked capable of winning a title in back-to-back seasons since the start of the 90's (or maybe 2000-2002 if you're being generous), there aren't any clubs who have overtaken us in that sort of timeframe without a larger net spend in the last 25 years (though it's a bit skewed in favour of spending before the big TV deal Premier League money influx if you don't doctor inflation to account for it).

There are a lot of periods and clubs you can pick and choose as examples for and against (there was a point in time where our last five year spend was barely higher than Stoke, because of our fairly frugal transfer windows between '08 and '11) but overall the clubs winning the titles are Man Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea and City, who also happen to be the clubs who spent the most in the last two decades by quite a decent margin (really we're only close to Arsenal). The most damning comment you could really make is that we're the highest spenders out of all the other clubs who don't have anything much to show for the last 20 years in terms of league titles. 

One place I do think we slip up is actually in our sales of players, in that we don't seem to negotiate nearly as hard as we could do over the price that players leave for. Which, given it's the other side of the minus sign, could make a pretty reasonable difference in our final net spend figures.

Still, the principle is certainly accurate, but religions don't tend to move without the desire of their leaders. If Islam is ever going to be accepted in the West wholeheartedly, it needs to stop producing violent, unpredictable and curiously well-equipped men with the emotional resilience of children. That's not going to happen unless a majority of their leaders across the whole world want it to and are open about it.

There's nothing special about our club, it's a competitive market, and there's zero reason why our percentage of successful transfers or ROI for transfer spend should be better than a club like Spurs or Southampton. We're looking to sign the best potential and current talent at the lowest possible price, but so is every other club that exists through the football league and it's pretty unlikely we'd ever be #1 all of the time. 

Being the best at spending money is really difficult - it's a tough market to win in (plus for every bargain a club gets, there's a selling club that could have made a lot more money if they'd held on another season or two). It's hard to even track which people are doing a good job because staff change so much, outliers can skew the data and the market for player values is constantly shifting and inflating. 

Obviously the transfer market is a part of the game we want to win at, but I think the big insight from some of the Tomkins data (more from his previous posts than this one) is that the clubs that actually go on to consistently win trophies aren't clubs that win in the transfer market, they're clubs that have so much money that they don't even have to bother playing that game in the first place. If Man City and Man Utd spend twice the money that we do every season, then even if our transfer signings are twice as intelligent and valuable, we're still only maintaining that gap.

The crux of it is that the law acknowledges that sometimes an individual is too drunk to give consent so even if she did consent it wouldn't be valid.

This is terrifying for many guys I know. 

But also note that Mcdonald, whom she originally slept with, was found not guilty. Evans turned up to the hotel after he received a text saying McDonald ""got a bird"" and then showed up to the hotel.

There judge refers to CCTV evidence when he says ""CCTV footage shows, in my view, the extent of her intoxication when she stumbled into your friend"" which a jury would have seen and obviously come tot he conclusion that she was too drunk to consent.

A drunk woman may feel she has the ability to look after herself and even get into a taxi and to a hotel to have a one night stand with a guy. But that then goes beyond what the judge, jury and I imagine a large part of society feels is within the realms of normal expectation when his friend shows up and asks to join in.

Then, that friend, who came in through reception obtaining keys by his own admission ""deceiving"" the receptionist and after having sex with her left through an emergency exit rather than through reception.

It's a very messy case. But I feel that the news aren't conspiring to report this in any dodgy way. Plus the judge and jury have more information that we have.

So while most Muslims won't actually go and kill a gay person, you'd be surprised how many think it *should* be punishable by death. Or try being a gay son of muslim parents and see how that works out for you.

Same for arranged/forced marriages. Most aren't ""forced"" like the girl getting duct taped in the boot of the car and shipped off to marriage. But most are heavily pressured from families, where you know you will be disowned and be a disgrace to the family if you don't go ahead with it. 

And as for drawing Mohammed.. just look at the mass worldwide protests and the huge numbers of death threats that the cartoonists receive. Again, most Muslims won't go and kill the cartoonists themselves, but a huge number clearly support it.

There are definitely some different interpretations, of course. But the religion does dictate that you can't pick and choose very much. Thus you can't compare Christians and Muslims in this respect.

Infact a lot of people were killed in the past because they were declared not ""real"" Christians for believing or interpreting something the ""wrong"" way.

Some Muslims argue that Islam is a religion of peace others argues it justifies vioence. Same goes for the Bible, look at the Crusades for example. You are basically saying Christianity is different because you can pick and choose. Yet the Bible is meant to be the word of god, people have just chosen to beleive it isn't. Just as many Muslims choose to take a message of peace from the Quran.

Religion isn't real, it isn't the word of god. People will believe what they want. And just like at various times people have used the Bible to justify awful things so do people use the Quaran. The flip side of the coin, of course, being that sometimes people have done really great or noble things based off their interpretation of their religion. 

&gt;I would say that the bible says a lot of crazy stuff, and people pick and choose freely because they are hypocrites. But the Quran says crazy stuff and people pretty much have to follow it, otherwise they aren't really Muslim at all.

I don't see any reason this is more true for the Quran. People used to say the exact same thing about the Bible, now they don't but you still consider them Christian right? Even if they are hypocrites. 

And, as I've said, fundamentalism is a word for a reason. If ALL Muslims were fundamentalists what would be the point in specifying?

I mean it is a theological, and ultimately pointless debate, at the end o the day we should look at what people identify as to decide what religion they are. And we should look at groups and individuals actions, not millions of people and generalise them all.

I honestly feel it is slightly insulting as it implies that while white westerners can be varied and think for themselves the majority of Muslims are backwards people who all just conform to one belief and stereotype.

Hopefully turkeyGob just made a mistake and will change his wording in future. But there is a hell of a lot of people that don't react like that sadly. Even people who don't have a problem with, in this example, transsexual people often start defending their ""right"" to say it or get defensive and start using the ""well it wasn't meant in a biggoted way so it is ok"" argument and so on. All of those are products of lack of education (social and formal) but on a deeper level than just not knowing that specific term is wrong, it is the people who don't understand why it bothers people in the first place, or deliberately abuse people, who are the bigger problem.

You are right that /u/Dryhtscipe comparison doesn't work very well due to Saudi Arabia not being a secular state. But you are creating a false dilemma, as I pointed out elsewhere. You are saying a Muslim state has to be radical and fundamentalist and, frankly, medieval. That isn't true at all. Unless you are saying a state that doesn't have those things aren't ""real"" Muslims, but then it comes a theological argument (similar to the ones made by many Muslim extremists to justify killign Muslims funnily enough) and the reality of the situation would be the same. Not everyone who identifies as a Muslim is radical, and it isn't up to you to decide if they can call themselves Muslims or not...

And also although you are right that you can law and religion are tied much more closesly together you still can't just label all Muslims as feeling that.

Some of those cases I'd say are unfortunate collateral damage that while needs adressing isn't severe enough that we should desire to go back to how things were. 

Some of the problems are more severe, namely when it affects the course of justice. To me this isn't an issue with PCness ruining the country. It is people not knowing the law and understanding the reasoning behind it which makes them scared to act. That is something that can relatively easily be remedied. And what happened to personal responsility? The Rotherham shit is on the heads of the people involved, not political correctness. 

The law should protect the police when carrying out investigations. However at the same time people need to be protected from police abuse and it isn't like we have the best (not the worst but far from best) of police not targetting ethnic (and other) minorities and treating them badly. There is a saying about trust that can't remember but is essentially ""you can lose trust in a second but it takes a lifetime to earn it back"". 

And you also have to look at other factors. For example anything involving rape you have to look at morals, values, widely held beliefs, etc as well as a host of other poltical factors. Not just one law. For example many people still feel like a lot of rapes were partly the victims fault (shouldn't wear a miniskirt, etc) and many people also feel that lots of people lie about rape in various ways, all sorts of disgusting attitudes (I can speak from personal experience on that one due to one of my friends being involved with the police in a rape case (she was the victim) and my fiance has done various charity work with rape victims and her experience echoes mine) . All that is a factor as well and the people who try to place it all on political correctness are being reductionist to the point of absurdity. 

There isn't a perfect solution but it would be a step in the wrong direction to ""go back"" but reacontiarys always come out the woodwork when something happens.

I never said it was perfect and I'd be more than happy to see it improved. This post is targetted more at the ""terroists win"", ""mah freedoms"", etc reactionary crowd.

&gt;the fear of causing offence is so great that the harm done is far worse than the alternative, and nobody seems to care!

Erm, I hate to ask this as it feels cheap way of proving my point but I hope I've done enough to demonstrate that this is only a part of my wider point; are you white? And/or a man? I defintiely don't think that means you need to matyr yourself for your sins but I do think it might affect your judgment. 

For many minority groups the alternative *is* far worse than the current situation. If you go back to the 60s. 70s or even 80s you might be surprised and realise that actually it isn't ""a lot of the time"". You just don't realise it because by it's nature it is somethign you only notice when it goes wrong. You don't go walking around and think ""it's great that no one called that person a nigger"" do you? 

I'd rather give up a few tiny bits of my rights so others can enjoy a full, happy life and are protected from being treated as anything other than just another person. Than jealously guard every conceivable freedom even if doing so actually causes other people to have their rights infringed upon.

Gosh, I sure hope not. I know we spent a lot in the summer but it has become quite clear that we need a sort of Luis Suarez type player: a pure goal-scorer.

I think that takes a lot of pressure off our much-heralded youngsters, it takes pressure off our defence, it gives us the flexibility to make-do when/if Sturridge is injured (and, of course, be amazing when they're both in the squad), etc. etc.

I'm sure I'm over-simplifying to a certain extent but that is the single biggest move we need to make as soon as possible.

Obviously, that's easier said than done and there are many, many hurdles (the generally inflated price of the January window, the willingness of this sort of player to not only be in the position to leave his club but is willing to come to Liverpool (esp. without CL being clearly on the horizon)) but I sure we can do *something*.",null,0,null,1420877577,null,0,false,0,cnkd5sm,null,t3_2rwq6n,null,t1_cnkd5sm,null,t1_cnkc36w,null,null,null,1424956991,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null
