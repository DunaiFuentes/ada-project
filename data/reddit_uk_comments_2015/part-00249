Now they're trying to cheap out on Benteke a week after spending 29m on Firminho without any back and forth? Baffling.

null,false,chimpyang,null,null,null,"Short sarky answer - Despite telly portrayals Medicine is not an exact science.  In other news: managers are hired to hit targets, water is wet, etc...

Longer answer:  I don't know what the reporters were expecting at the end of 4 weeks training?  To be let loose to go off script with what has to be assumed to be bare minimal medical knowledge.  The differential for ""chest pain"" is a full spectrum of stuff, from innocuous pains to serious stuff like heart attacks and aortic dissections.  The system has presumably been designed by clinicians to triage those apart as best you can over the phone - all without the help of fancy tests and scans as well as the chance for physical contact - with staff who by and large are not clinicall trained.  We (as a country) has opted for a triage system on the cheap to field initial presentations - well, ta da, this is what we get.  You can't be surprised at the outcome here...?!

The article also does a good job in conveying the reporters' feelings on realising how alone and scary clinical uncertainty feels (and it's a horrible feeling that will keep surprising you) and then taking this essential part of what medicine is to use it as an attack on the NHS.  This comes through the way that they treat getting an ambulance to anyone with chest pain as a ""win"" - thus offloading clinical anxiety onto someone else - and getting that the feeling that even if something bad happened - *it wasn't your fault because you sent an ambulance* - unfortunately, the reporters didn't get to see the side of medicine that shows that despite doing everything to the best of your ability - shitty stuff will still happen to people and that people still die regardless of what you do.  Efficient and effective medicine is in doing what is right, not always things that massages your conscience.  For example - we could CT Head everyone who comes in with a head injury - *y'aknow - just in case*.  Whilst I'd be happier knowing that the patient almost 100% doesn't have a bleed - I have to take it as clinical judgement and probability (based on robust NICE guidelines on who to scan or not).

The article does highlight a couple of good points though - the fiddling of data is deplorable - but you have to remember that the NHS is an organisation run by and staffed with *humans* - and like everyone else, there will be people who would happily fiddle data to meet targets and hide problems for personal gain.

The other point highlighted is just how short staffed we are across the board - people are very quick to dismiss any public sector discontent as ""you should be grateful for what you got, cos I pay your wages"" etc... but there's a breaking point when enough staff go off sick or leave for other professions/countries that means that we are no longer able to run the service that we want, but only to firefight the needs that we can.

Falcao has never been a runner, his teammates do the work and once the ball is around the box, he takes over. We have the players suited to his skill set. 

If we want to compare him to Torres, then sure, the mental hurdle of getting over an injury is present, but it ends there. Torres was not a renowned goalscorer at Atletico, he only found that form in his first couple of seasons at liverpool. 

Falcao has always been a poacher. If you look back at last season, not one of the United strikers did well. Their system did not suit Falcao, and they did not create many chances despite breaking the transfer record to sign dobby. They created less chances than QPR. Falcao is not someone like Costa who can run the channels and create his own chances.

I'll say this, though: the panel DOES need a few younger members on it in the future.  I'm in my 50s, and I long to see young blood on QI.  Byrne would fill that role nicely.  There'd be no harm in giving him a shot at it.  He might be brilliant, but we won't know until he's actually on there.

Daniel Radcliffe was awesome.  He had knowledge galore!  And he was funny when he needed to be.  The only problem I had with his appearance was that the guy almost monopolized the episode, he knew so much.

""Having sympathy with the motives of the charlie hebdo attackers"" (protecting the dignity of islam) doesn't necessary mean endorsing their methods (slaughter). The question is ambiguously worded at best.

I don't know why you paste me a load of links about Muslims' attitudes towards gay people, because I was answering the implication that a plurality of UK Muslims sympathize with AQAP. Many muslims have views I strongly disagree with. But so do many people. Such is liberal democracy.

My freedom of speech is more threatened by counter-terrorism measures and monitors than my fellow british muslims.

There are plenty of other white british people who believe the most illiberal things. And plenty of Muslims like the OP who I mostly agree with. Conservative Muslims make up sizable percent *of four percent* of the county. Why should I be worried about the democratic repercussions of that?

I don't know if language would be an issue in terms of settling in, but his English is pretty good in terms of footballing language. Finally, he is very experienced and has played in several systems throughout his career as a full back, wingback, and wide midfielder. 

Nagatomo looks like he will be playing for Schalke, Lille, or West Ham next season. Japanese media confirming the Italian media reports. I don't think Liverpool will be signing him at this point.

in my opinion he is doing this for a few different reasons.

a. Chelsea have a way more money so his pay should increase significantly even not being a starter.

b. Mourinho likes to keep his #2 keeper sharp so he still will get to play some especially cup games and maybe even some league games to rest Curtois for CL.

c. he is vice captain of Bosnia and by far their best so no worries there.

d. finally get some silverware.

e. Mourinho

f. he is damn good and who knows, with the right training he might be able to really challenge Curtois for some time. 

Begovic has been the most underrated keeper in the EPL over the last 5 years in my opinion. would be interesting to see how he does with an actually good back line in front of him to organize.

On the other hand, both Star Trek and Doctor Who came out roughly around the same time, with Doctor Who  in 63 and Star Trek in 66.  Anyway, they've appeared in comics together and I believe there was talk of trying to have a spinoff with a Who-like character that ever materialized.  Also with TOS's and TNG's talk of using space itself as means of time travel along with parallel dimensions the two could work together even if they haven't.

Just thinking aloud, so if Who began in 63 ended in 89, TOS began in 66 ended 69 but had movies with that group from 79, 82, 84, 86, 89 and 92 the only way for it to mingle with Who would be through movies and a good deal would be lost with time lords showing up on the Enterprise bridge with no context.  You could make a case for TNG but it started when Who was in its final years in 87.  Also '05 is the last time Star Trek appeared on TV coincidentally as Who came back in its current form.

Would current Doctor Who work on an episode or two (or many) if they brought Star Trek back on TV, especially with the [references](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who) including a thought about the topic from former showrunner Russell T.

He's never going to displace Eriksen as CAM, but I feel he could do a decent job in midfield alongside a more defensive player. In my opinion, there's nothing Mason does that Carroll couldn't, and Bentaleb can't realistically play every game next season. After Paulinho's transfer, that leaves us with Dembele and Stambouli/Capoue who can fill in there - the latter two don't seem to be in our plans at all, and Dembele's best performances of late have been in the 10 role.

If we don't get any cover for Eriksen this window, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't keep Carroll. Ultimately, it's probably down to him and how much play time he wants. I just hope we keep him; he's a young English lad from nearby, who came through our system and seems to have an absolutely superb attitude. Plus, it helps that he probably has a very, very good relationship with Kane, Townsend and any other young players who came through here.

The problem isn't that the UK is lacking capacity like many will suggest, simply saying ""why not expand Manchester"" or similar doesn't solve the problem, Heathrow is restrained by capacity (in so many more ways than simply it can't expand..) and it is Heathrow that is experiencing increasing demand for capacity, you can expand elsewhere with the best will in the world but it doesn't mean it will be used - that's a mistake which has been repeated time and time again in the aviation sector.

I personally don't know where I stand, its an absolute mine field of a decision! Something needs to happen at Heathrow but I can't help but feel the positive impact of expansion doesn't truly outweigh the negatives.

That was your first mistake. It's not a tax, you can choose not to have a TV licence and get essentially the same service except live broadcasting. You can still access on demand services for only the price you pay for subscriptions and even then for things like iPlayer or ITV on demand etc you don't even pay them. You are in no way being forced to pay for the TV licence yet income tax, national insurance, you are.

&gt;So why am I having to subsidise your entertainment with the TV License tax?

This argument annoys me for several reasons. Do you also abhor subsiding other people's treatment on the NHS? Do you despise funding drug rehabilitation services for those in need? Do you disdain spending tax pounds on the police and fire services when you don't use it? Do you hate your tax money being spent on other people's children?

What you want as an individual is dwarfed by what society deserves. Complaining about subsidising a public service is quite a shallow argument. It stinks of selfishness and doesn't help anyone but yourself. How is that in any way a good thing? The BBC remit involves education, entertainment and information. ***For society***. Not just you.

Driving the car was horrible to start with. The steering wheel made it feel as if I was driving the vehicle by committee. It was so sluggish and alien but I got through it (barely) although I do still feel more at home on the bike, more engaged in the process of using the road, more responsive.

Cars just can't avoid things very easily. On the bike, I think and the bike shifts to avoid a pothole or whatever.

In the car, I think, I move the wheel, the car kind of gathers up some slack, I move the wheel a bit more, the car begins to veer, I move the wheel a bit more and eventually the car changes direction.

&gt; One of the more interesting things to come out of the hearings is that Tottenham have already been granted a £350m ""bridge loan"" to help finance the construction of the new stadium, and that, apparently, a naming rights sponsor has already been secured. While this is perhaps not surprising, it is most definitely something that had up until now not been announced by the club. The bridge loan was secured ""in the event of a funding shortfall of the stadium,"" which essentially indicates that Spurs are ready to move on groundbreaking as soon as possible. The identity of the stadium naming rights sponsor was not disclosed.

Have Liverpool bought the next Coutinho, or been ripped off?

 IT WAS one of those offhand remarks that betrayed an important truth. After interviewing Philippe Coutinho, I bumped into Brendan Rodgers in Melwood’s car park. “You were seeing Philippe?” he asked, smiling, “we’d love to get more like him.”

Indeed, finding the next Coutinho seemed a Liverpool obsession after the Brazilian’s 2013 capture from Inter Milan. An obsession in money terms: snaffling such talent for just £8.5m spawned an unhealthy addiction to bargain-seeking.

This was the week Liverpool kicked it. The package for Roberto Firmino involves paying Hoffenheim up to £29m and committing £26m in wages, an outlay worth more than one-third of the £150m cost of Anfield’s reconstruction. Firmino is no bargain. And yet Rodgers could at last have his new Coutinho. Liverpool forgot price to focus on why Coutinho worked as an investment in playing terms.

He has technique, he can be spontaneous and imaginative in using it, yet he accepts tactical disciplines and (more than any English starlet would) being shifted around different roles. It’s a professionalism that stems from the conviction that nothing, even expressing your flair, is more important than doing what it takes to win. It’s a very South American thing. And so is Coutinho’s durability, despite his baby-face, boyish build and the physical nature of the Premier League. “The physicality is no problem,” he shrugged in our interview.

The South American footballer: skill, with street toughness; ability with edge. Liverpool also found it with Luis Suarez and that they’ve gone back to South America to seek the spark they’ve missed since Suarez left is further testimony to that continent’s player production line.

Ability with edge. English clubs  used to look north for that mix, to the players once spilling from the tenements and pits and steel towns of Scotland. Now, the search goes south, to the Americas of Suarez and of Alexis Sanchez, who has so sharpened Arsenal, and of Sergio Aguero, who brings the decisiveness to Manchester City.


Manchester United and Tottenham’s record signings are South Americans, Angel Di Maria and Erik Lamela, who haven’t yet become but still have potential to be their clubs’ X factors. The striker chosen by Jose Mourinho to complete his title-winning Chelsea side was Diego Costa, naturalised by Spain but born, shaped and hardened in Brazil.

Costa came from obscurity and poverty — “his village is beyond the sunset, he’s still that guy” Mourinho says — as did Suarez, Aguero and Sanchez. Firmino has his own ragged back-story. From Maceio, a picturesque but violent city in Brazil’s tropical northeast, his father walked the roads selling bottles of water to drivers in traffic jams. Firmino’s dominant thought, when plucked to move from second division Figueirense to Hoffenheim, aged 19, was: “My family will never have to work again.”

Hoffenheim’s scout had noted Firmino’s application: if he failed a training exercise he listened to his coaches and tried and tried again. Liverpool supporters are revelling in internet clips of Firmino scoring volleys and flicks in the Bundesliga but also testimony from Didi Hamann. “I’ve spoken to people who have worked with him and he won’t get bullied,” Hamann said.

Ability with edge. Firmino created more chances and completed more dribbles than any Bundesliga player over the past two seasons, yet only five players made more tackles — all defensive midfielders.

He’s young — just 23 —  and hasn’t even played Europa League, never mind Champions League football, but four goals in his first nine appearances for Brazil suggest he is ready to step up. German observers see Firmino as having excelled in a top 10 team and at the point where he should play for a top five one. Manchester United liked him,  even if they decided other positions were their priority. But Bayern Munich scouted Firmino heavily and were not sure. “He is one of the best I’ve seen in more than 20 years reporting on the Bundesliga,” says German football commentator Gunter Schroth. Yet Brazilian television reporter Carlos Mota says: “For the national team he is a level below even Fred and Luis Fabiano, but let’s wait. He’s still young and it is possible he’ll grow. For me, a very expensive ‘bet’ by Liverpool.”

That the Premier League is increasingly putting its money on South Americans brings England in line with the rest of the world. Barcelona have the best team thanks to Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi and, from Romario to Ronaldo to Ronaldinho, they’ve been buying them for years. So, too, Real Madrid, Bayern, Paris Saint-Germain and most of Portugal and Serie A. Drive through Botafogo, in Rio de Janeiro, at 1am and you’ll see players on the floodlit beachside pitches: the production line works overtime.

More than 500 Brazilians play professionally in Europe and in 2008, a high point of spending, before recession tempered clubs around the globe, 1,200 Brazilians left their country to play abroad, in moves worth $250m. Brazilians are such willing exports because of economics. As recently as 2010, 60% of players in Brazil were on the minimum wage.


ROGON, the German agency who represent Firmino, have a Brazilian subsidiary with offices in Rio, Salvador and Porto Alegre, and have just helped Hoffenheim replace Firmino with the Brazil Under-17 forward Joelinton. Across Europe’s big five  leagues, Brazil leads the way in providing expatriate players then, after France, it’s Argentina.  Brazilians don’t always thrive in the Premier League and Firmino is  joining one of the world’s most scrutinised clubs. But Liverpool have done well with Brazilians. Lucas Leiva is their longest-serving player. Coutinho talks about the “Brazilian feel” of clannish, informal, Merseyside. “Liverpool is a friendly club and I feel part of a big family. They’re as friendly as Brazilians. There’s a Brazilian way of dealing with [a personal relationship] in Liverpool,” he says.

Firmino will play where Rodgers wants. He was a “false nine” when scoring 16 and assisting 12 Bundesliga goals in 2013-14 and moved to the flanks, with a focus on pressing defenders, as Hoffenheim adopted a more defensive style last season. He’s the 29th player signed since Rodgers arrived in 2012, Nathaniel Clyne is poised to become the 30th, and at some point Liverpool must stop recruiting and settle their squad. But a spark was necessary. And Firmino is from the right part of the world — a good, if expensive, bet.",null,0,null,1435740020,null,0,false,0,csoi8yb,null,t3_3bqeex,null,t1_csoi8yb,null,t3_3bqeex,null,null,null,1437486007,null,20,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,20,null

From Jan, maybe things have/will change but:

&gt;The Treasury publishes figures which show how all tax and benefits policies since George Osborne’s first budget in 2010 to last year’s autumn statements have changed annual incomes
We can see from the final column in the graph that the overall effect on all households is pretty flat, but it makes a big difference which income bracket you are in.
The very richest have been hit the most by government policies, and for middle earners the effect is a giveaway that more than cancels out the £1,600-a-year cost-of-living deficit identified by Labour.
For people at the very bottom of the income distribution, the sum effect on income of all the government’s policies appears to be a big fat zero.",null,0,null,1435740199,null,0,1435740592,0,csoiajv,null,t3_3bpgmx,null,t1_csoiajv,null,t1_csohrpb,null,null,null,1437486046,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

He says we're searching for a new Coutinho which is the typical media nonsense. Coutinho and Firmino are only similar in that they play near the front and are both Brazilians signed by Liverpool. The way he has drawn comparisons here is just lazy journalism. We also don't need a new Coutinho because we already have the current Coutinho.

There also isn't a ""rise"" in South American talent in Europe. There has always been a strong South American input to European football. I read a good decade ago that Brazil exports thousands of footballers every year. This is hardly news.

The rise of South American influence in the Premier League is worth mentioning though. If he'd made that the focus of his article then it would have been an interesting read. Unfortunately it only registers two throwaway paragraphs where he points to South Americans in significant clubs which even the most casual of fans could do.

It reads to me like a collection of lazy associations strung together into a filler article with little to no thought involved.

I don't drive - I don't have a car license. I do however have a full bike license, and have been commuting 40 miles a day for about 18 months on two wheels now.

I believe that by doing that, by being the vulnerable party on the road for that period of time, it has given me a bit of an appreciation about roadcraft and general road use that I wouldn't necessarily have had if I was a car driver.

Billions actually, but it's not disrespectful. It's about our right to express ourselves which is far bigger than any single religion.

If they are lesser human beings we should be free to critique them, surely, and then what? We should be free to treat them differently? Free to take their business? Put them in camps?
Referring to any human being as anything less that a human being, and not having a mutual respect for all cultures, religions, ect. Is a dangerous game that has dangerous consequences.

Attacks on horses? That's not especially cool. Neither are attacks on the actual huntsmen. You know, when the 6 or so grown men attacked another man with metal bars and stamped on his head? That's not very cool, either. 

Especially when the hunts are hunting a drag line. You know, the bit where there's no animal being hunted?


What about that time when sabs were caught picking up foxes killed on the road to plant as evidence of illegal hunting?

Oh, look. It's not about animal welfare at all, is it. *ninja edit: All the hunt followers I know work in the countryside. They're far from toffs. Stalin would have had murals made of this mob, that's how proletariat they are.

I do some work with a foxhound rescue (and own a foxhound. He's a dick, but wouldn't know what to do with a fox if it ran under his nose). They re-home lost or stolen pack hounds who can't go back to the hunt (probably because some 'well meaning' rescuer has had them neutered and obliterated the tattoo in the ear), as well as harriers and similar types.

We could be living in a Christian theocracy in which all other religious practice is banned, and apostates and adherents of other religions are either forced to recant their beliefs or be put to death. *That* would be disrespectful of Muslim religious belief.

No it doesn't. This report is not *about* levels of relative poverty. That's like saying the commentary on a football game ignores the rugby match occurring on the same day.

&gt;""The best route out of poverty is work and this government makes no apology for its efforts to raise incomes by expanding employment opportunities.""

Most people living in poverty in the UK work. So, the first part of this sentence is a lie. The second part is irrelevant: Maybe the government is, maybe it isn't. What does that have to do with the violation of the rights of children?

I mean for fuck's sake, UKIP are a splinter group of the Tories, they're cut from completely different cloth to the BNP but anybody with a political education beyond *Comment is Free* and Tumblr could tell you that. If this sub is really going to make me point out the offensively obvious their economic policies are completely different, the BNP are quite keen on state control over the economy (to almost socialist levels actually) while UKIP are largely economic libertarians like Thatcher. Their social policies are nothing alike, UKIP is literally a development of what the Tory backbench has been saying for decades while the BNP are massively authoritarian and want to repatriate non-whites to their countries of origin. Finally, the BNP are fundamentally racist whereas UKIP cannot be accurately described that way.

Both are a celebration of intolerance. We want to tackle home grown extremists but at the same time want to use the free speech we value so much and want them to value as much as we do in order to mock their belief system. It doesn't make any sense. People may argue that it is a symbolic symbol of resistance to intolerance but in reality it's just stooping to their level. The shit slinging needs to stop, it's driving a wedge between non Muslims an the moderates who see this shit and think ""hmm they really don't value or respect our beliefs"" and the hatred starts there. Part of the problem with home grown extremism is people feeling isolated in their communities, how is this not isolating them?

null,false,RedTinted,null,null,null,"This a great piece man, well done. However, this isn't enough for me to change my opinion on Benteke. There is a few noticeable holes in the points you'd made.
You stated he isn't injury prone, then mentioned the bad achilles injury he picked. Now with a brief understanding of physiotherapy, you'd realised that tendons, like the achilles, are prone to damage once they have been severely hurt before, thus meaning that Benteke is in fact prone to future achilles problems. With Sturridge spending virtually all of last season injured, spending more or less all our remaining budget on Benteke doesn't make sense to me.
Second, you said Benteke would 'press as much as he can'. Now, while i would appreciate the continual effort after watching a season of Balotelli, what if Benteke giving 100% while pressing isn't good enough? We need a player who has played a similar style previously, so they can come in a hit the ground running. Liverpool are notoriously slow starters in the league, we can't afford our most expensive signing needing months to adapt to an entirely different footballing philosophy.
I'm not one of the people of who completely dismisses Benteke as a shite player. He's not. At the right club he could be brilliant, but, in my opinion, Liverpool is not said 'right club'. For 32.5m, there are so many better suited players. Like Bacca, like Icardi, like Aubameyang. And before i get slated for suggesting those players as they're 'unrealistic' considering we can't offer CL football, Inter Milan, despite finishing 8th in Serie A last season have already signed Kondogbia, probably the best young player in the world of his type.
In my opinion, this signing would underline the problem with the club's transfer strategy, with fact that the only suitable player they could find to take us forward is in the same league playing for a team in the bottom 5.

We accept scarcity exists which is why we seek to distribute the limited resources the earth has in an equitable manner and use them sustainably.

&gt;They wish to keep the poor, poor for lack of a better term.

No indeed, we believe that there is enough wealth, if properly distributed, for everyone to meet their essential needs. We want an economy based on production to meet actual needs and to produce human happiness rather than endless material excess and waste for its own sake.

&gt;it's a bit like halting human progress where we are

Human progress is not an endless striving after evermore stuff and things, we want people to have more time to engage in learning, creating, exploring and simply spending time with people. We very much want human progress to continue but in a direction that works with the planet.

&gt; I think economic growth and technological progress will lead to a greener society

This is the belief in the fairy money tree. The earth is finite and it is it is simply magical thinking to believe that growth, which depends on the finite resources of the earth, can be infinite. Equally the idea that humanity will find a technological solution is just an article of faith, there is no good reason to believe we will be able to do this in time or indeed at all. 

Rather than having religious faith that science will save the day we should take the simple and practical solution to our climate and environmental problems and reduce our global production and consumption in an equitable manner.

&gt;perhaps in the developing world

Bingo, the air in Cardiff is cleaner now because our production is done in China and other countries that are more polluted than ever before. Indeed the level of emissions globally is more than 10 times what it was in 1900. It is our material consumption that fuels the smogs of China and we will perish too with the climate catastrophe that follows from it.

I hope to god that this won't influence the players too much, in the sense that it was clear that they were all behind Nige, despite tumultuous times and a really harsh run of results. On only a very small few occasions did the team not perform as that; a solid, unified, passionate team, clearly giving it everything for the manager and each other. The transfers made this summer seem to suggest that Pearson had no idea this was coming, as they all seem to suit a style of play (fast, attacking, creative forwards fed by Camb/Fuchs from the middle and supported by Mahrez/Albs/Schlupp on the left and right, with a solid back three) that Pearson managed well in the last quarter of the season. People like Schlupp, Mahrez, Schmeichel - I would wager that the manager had a big part in their perspectives on the future of the club and their own success. Same for our new signings.

No, grass is always greener and I would imagine anywhere else will never quite feel like home, atleast not for a long time.

Nothing really. I don't think the UK is particularly unique. There are many similar countries all with their own history and culturaly quirks. 

I think 'being the best at' will become ever more redundant with globalisation. A country might become a hub, but are we really 'the best at' Finance when half of the city is filled with the 'best' bankers from around the world?

Perceived noise is just how loud a sound appears to us due to the imbalance in our ears.

For instance sounds outside of our hearing range could be 100dB and we wouldn't be able to hear it but a 50Hz sound would be very loud.

You can test this by getting a frequency sound generator and moving the frequency around but keeping the volume the same. Some frequencies appear louder than others

Edit: This is a good one:

Ever since the Mumbai attack they have been preparing, and keeping armed response units within 15 minutes of potential hotspots (like Canary Wharf.)

London, though, is the only viable target for propaganda purposes (the main point of terrorism - think of it as violent propaganda, they're trying to influence people), because it's very rare for people outside of the UK to have heard of Nottingham or Manchester (or if they have heard of it, to have little concept of what they actually are.)

We are sufficiently protected against terror attacks, due to the nature of these attacks though some will always slip through the net no matter how wide it is. Once on the ground lone gunmen, or small groups of gunmen, can act far quicker than any organisation in the world can react. Interdiction and interception long before they enact plans is probably the best option, but it's still not full proof.

You just have to kind of expect it to happen one day. At some point, someone is going to go on a gun rampage - whether it be for religion, racism, a special kind of insanity, or some kind of political ideology.

null,false,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,null,"Well, I'm not an ecologist so you'd need to look at some of the stats put out by conservation orgs for exact numbers but as far as I understand it, the benefit is scale, basically. It's fucking huge, and for the most part relatively unspoiled.

I'm a keen birdwatcher, and until last Feb grew up and lived in the estuary. In winter it's host to literally hundreds of thousands of wading birds, ducks and geese. Some of these make up significant proportions of their national or global populations, and most are in decline across their ranges. Then there's the birds that stay on and breed, again, most of which are in decline, the marine mammals (which are of enough interest that ZSL have an ongoing study of them), seahorses (apparently!) and so on.

Given that it's bloody huge, there's no amount of habitat offsetting that could replace the potential habitat that would be lost, even if we were up to the technical challenges of getting it just right. Which, so I've read, we're not sure about. But even if we could replace it somewhere (where?!) there's no guarantee that these birds, which have been using the estuary for thousands of years, would find it or use it.

As for costs/benefits... well, there your milage may vary. As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth it. We should be flying less and I reckon within our lifetimes flight will drop off as fuel becomes prohibitively expensive. I think the wildlife we have has an intrinsic value that's not financial and is worth protecting. Other people mightn't give two shits about brent geese and dunlins and others still might know more than me about long term oil supply (though I know it will, eventually, run out).

The answer is no. In Scotland for example, unless the attack happened in Glasgow or Edinburgh, gunmen would likely have 10/15 minutes of unchallenged killing before anymore than 2 armed Police officers would arrive at the scene.

A co-ordinated attack in two seperate locations in Scotland would be unimaginable. You could be looking at 30/40 minutes of unchallenged killing before there's sufficient Police resources to end it. Scotland could quite easily play host to the worst firearm related massacre in history.

&gt;Rising three storeys tall, in an idyllic setting on the banks of [Lough Gill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lough_Gill), in [County Leitrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Leitrim), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), __Parke’s Castle__ is a [plantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_(settlement_or_colony\)) era castle. In 1610 __Roger Parke__ completed his fortified [manor house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_house) on the site of an earlier fifteenth-century O'Rourke ([Uí Ruairc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Breifne)) castle. He kept the walls of the original [bawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bawn) - a spacious pentagonal defensive area - and demolished the O'Rourke tower house in the centre. The stones of O’Rourke’s tower were used to build the three-storey manor on the eastern side, eventually adorned with [mullioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullion) windows and diamond-shaped chimneys.

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; Historically, Labour do better when the economy's growing and the Tories do better when it's shrinking, whoever's in government at the time.

No, historically the opposition party does better when the government appears to have fucked up:

* 1945 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background context: WWII coming to an end, the country was war exhausted and now needed an opportunity to rebuild.

* 1951 - Labour kicked out in favour of Tories. Background context: Labour were experiencing factional infighting at the time. Also perceived mishaps due to the handling of crises in the Middle East. Admittedly economy faltered due to us getting involved in the Korean War. 

* 1964 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background Context: despite 10 years of economy buoyancy, the economy started faltering in 1961. Government ministers were getting involved in sex scandals, and a bad choice of Tory leader cemented their doom.

* 1970 - Labour kicked out in favour of Tory. Background Context: Although the economy suffered in this period, it actually started picking up toward the election. However Labour had bad relations with the industry, and the rejection by France to let the UK into the Common Market was seen as a failure. The devaluation crisis was particularly bad.

* 1974 - Tory kicked out in favour of a (minority) Labour (our infamous previous example of a hung parliament). Background context: The country was actually in economic crisis due to the 1973-74 stock market crash. Combined with the 73 oil crisis, the miner's strikes, the three-day week electricity emergency - the Tory government had been an absolute disaster.

* 1979 - Labour kicked out in favour of Thatcher. Background Context: Winter Industrial disputes and strikes in 78-79, a 'failed' Scottish devolution referendum, and having failed a vote of no confidence vote.

* 1997 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background Context: John Major's disastrous run. Conservatives breaking out into infighting, a series of scandals, Black Wednesday.

Flags are just recognisable patterns on a cloth. You use them to rally your troops around a certain point in a battle, to identify yourself to others, and to signal.

I'm afraid I'm not super knowledgeable about skincare like some of the users are here on SCAUK, but I thought I'd see if I can help out in any way :)

From my google-fu skills, I see that Epiduo is a mix of adapalene &amp; benzoyl peroxide gel while Dalacin T topical lotion is a antibacterial topical lotion. Adapelene (in the Epiduo) itself is a retinoid (Vitamin A derivative) which has exfoliating action deep within your skin. The Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment is a BHA (a salicylic acid). 

Your currently have an exfoliator in your routine already (the Epiduo) and you are looking to another (BHA).

Just to clarify, are you on Roaccutane? If you are, then please be cautious on adding the Neutrogena BHA to your routine as it could be too much for your skin. Even if you are not, it would be a good idea to add the BHA very slowly to your routine. E.g. once every 3 days so your skin has a chance to get used to it, and then slowly increasing the frequency of use.

If you go all in at once, there is a risk you may overexfoliate your skin and damage your moisture barrier, leading to breakouts and terrible skin! I accidentally overexfoliated with my BHA 6 months ago because I used it too often when I first got it and I'm still dealing with the aftermath from that -_-'. Please be gentle to your skin!

I use prescription Istotrex (a vitamin A derivative like Adapalene) and a BHA exfoliating liquid. What I do is:

- cleanse 
- wait for it to air dry
- apply prescription medication first (Isotrex for me, Epiduo in your case)
- wait 45 minutes for it to work
- then apply BHA (Neutrogena in your case; put on a dry face, don't wet it!)
- wait 30 minutes for that to work
- wash my face
- continue with the rest of my routine.

I've read that you should apply the prescription medication as close to your bare skin as possible for maximum effect, which is why I use Isotrex before my BHA. I also wash my face with water after I am done with the exfoliating steps to have a clean canvas for my skincare products. You don't have to do this though, it's just personal preference :)

I've not used Cetaphil, but I have heard that they are nice and gentle. One thing you might want to do is check that your cleanser has a ph 5.5. This is so your skin's moisture barrier is maintained. Your skin is slightly acidic and has a ph 5.5. Using cleansers are higher in their pH (i.e. from 5.5-14) could potentially disrupt your moisturer barrier. This disruption might mean bacteria are able to get into your skin and cause acne. 

I hope this has helped and I'm sorry it's such a massive amount of information/wall of text!

**TL;DR:** Epiduo/Dalactin before Neutrogena. Apply Neutrogena to dry face. Be super slow in introducing Neutrogena to routine to prevent overexfoliation.

The reason for doing this is to reduce uncertainty, for the government and for the industry. Any aiport operator is still free to submit a planning application to expand their capacity, but their application will now be assessed against the findings contained in the new report. 

The difficulty with large infrastructure development is thateven getting to the stage where you're able to submit a planing application takes a lot of time and money. It's a big risk to the industry, which can be a problem when your country's national strategic infrastructure is privately owned, because it may not receive the necessary level of investment due to excessive red tape. These kind of projects require high levels of cooperation between industry and national government, because they inevitably involve public investment and compulsory purchases of property and provide more than purely economic benefits.

The last planning inquiry into Heathrow expansion took eight years, and ended up being defeated by a [High Court ruling](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8588220.stm) against it. Heathrow were still considering whether to appeal that decision when the new government was elected and withrew support for the plan.

If Heathrow are to build a new runway, they will have to go through the planning process all over again. However, they'll have the advantage this time of being able to use the Airports Commission report to make most of their case for them, which should reduce the time and cost of any inquiry.

Gatwick are also free to submit a planning application to build a new runway, and there's plenty in the new report that should help with that as well. There might also be less political objections to an expanded Gatwick, which would increase the likelihood of the plan receiving government support.

But what the new report doesn't do is answer the big question - does the UK need a new runway at all? Is increasing aviation capacity in the south east a national strategic priority that justifies the use of public funds to support private industry, or are there better ways we can do that, especially considering that the expected benefits won't be seen for another 50 years or so? That's something that continues to be overlooked in the minstream debate, where there seems to be an assumption that the forecast economic benefits over-ride any other consideration and that building a new runway is absolutely essential.

It swaps to whatever deal says it swaps to.  Generally this will be the chosen lender's standard variable rate (SVR).  Remember that at this point you could also, probably, choose to remortgage to another fixed or discounted deal.

&gt; which is the mortgage lenders set interest rate on top of the bank on England interest rate? 

Depends.  Lender's SVR's tend to broadly move in line with the BoE rate but are not necessarily explicitly linked to it.  Again, you have to look at the exact details of the deals.

&gt; When I've been looking it seems like a tracker would be a better deal in the long run and ultimately save us money 

It depends.  Ultimately it's a trade off of risk.  If you go for a fix you are 100% certain what your repayments will be for the duration of the fix.  With a tracker you are exposed to the risk that the BoE rate might rise significantly for some reason.

You pay a premium for that certainty in terms of fixed rates generally being a bit higher.  If you take a fix and interest rates stay low, you lose.  If interest rates spike, you win.

That's exactly what they do. I'm on my third with my lender and in another year I'll expect to be on my fourth. Its basically like renegotiating car insurance or a mobile phone contract at renewal.

Could've been very different for him had that final day been different. But Jol really began to change how the club functioned - and then Levy fucked him by setting up a deal with Ramos.

Classy way to treat the guy who nailed our first win vs. Chelsea since 1990, and took us to back-to-back European qualification since the 1970s.

Martin Martin, Jol,

Edit: 

&gt; The same is true for the Poppy, as it is a mark of national respect (of course you and others disagree)

Yes and that makes it subjective. The point being, the law should not exist to enshrine and protect the subjective opinions of people, no matter how many or few people hold those opinions. It should exist purely to defend the rights of the populace (I admit we are a long way away from this at present). We do not have the right to not be offended, thus neither drawing Mohammed nor burning poppies should be illegal, regardless of how many people find them offensive or for what reason they find them offensive. 

So we have put to bed the legal argument. Now for the moral one. I think it is wrong to offend people without good reason. Killing animals is offensive to some people, if I kill an animal for no reason than to offend those people, that is morally wrong. But I enjoy eating meat and believe meat is an essential part of a healthy diet, if I kill an animal to eat it, that is not morally wrong (putting aside any kind of animal right argument). Drawing and displaying images of Mohammed is offensive to some people. If I organise an exhibition of cartoons of Muhammad for no other reason than to offend that is morally wrong. If I feel Islam is a dangerous ideology and I believe I can spread that message and make the world a better place through drawing a cartoon of Muhammad, then that is not morrally wrong. Now only the people doing the acts themselves know their own reasons for doing so, the rest of us are left to judge on the evidence we have to hand. 

It's my guess that the cartoonists at CH had good reasons to draw their cartoons. But I believe that the organisers of this exhibition are only out to upset people, thus they are acting immorally and should not do what they are doing. 

This does not change the fact that I still think they have the right to do what they are doing and that the law should continue to protect that right.

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"The biggest issue with FPTP that I can see is that people don't understand what the system is designed to achieve.  It's not about creating a perfectly proportioned parliament, but rather ensuring that the people in that parliament are chosen representatives of their constituencies.  I mean, it does a poor job of that, as it's perfectly possible to win a constituency with the majority of people voting against a candidate, but like I say, I'm not trying to convince anyone that FPTP is the answer to any of life's problems.

Now it may be that you don't think that constituency representation is important when electing a parliament.  Indeed, you may believe that the most important aspect to parliament should be that it perfectly represents the voting distribution of the people.  That's a fair opinion.  In that case, then FPTP is definitely one of the worst voting systems - it doesn't care at all about the proportionality of parliament, but solely about individual constituencies.  But there are people who would disagree with that view and would argue that it is far more important for parliament to be made up of community representatives than it is for parliament to be perfectly balanced.  And for those people, FPTP is...  well, it's still fairly bad, but at least the main goal of FPTP is to achieve community representation.

The issue with this debate is that people are spending a lot of time shouting about how FPTP is unfair because it doesn't achieve their aims in an electoral system, without recognising that those aims are far from universal.  There are huge numbers of people for whom being represented by a local individual in parliament is the best thing about British democracy.  There are alternatives where, potentially, it may be possible to achieve both ideals, but we've got to be talking about this, deciding how we, as a democracy, want our democracy to work.",null,0,null,1435758335,null,0,false,0,csons70,null,t3_3bm4iu,null,t1_csons70,null,t1_csogp6p,null,null,null,1437490024,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Which interest rate?

&gt; I'm just having a look now and I can see it's 2.19% for a 2 year fixed rate but 2.99% for a 5 year fixed rate, will this change when I renegotiate?

If you mean is it likely that the fixed rates available in 2 or 5 years' time will be different to the ones available now then the answer is yes.

&gt; Also is it most likely that I will end up paying more or less after the 2 or 5 year period is up? Or will that depend entirely on the interest rates at the time?

It depends on the market conditions at the time.  Part of that is interest rates but there are other factors.

There's a huge difference between commentators in rags that are not known for quality, but instead specialise in selling their papers as fast as possible, as opposed to the quality broadsheets.  If you go to the Daily Mail for worthwhile expert opinion, then you deserve much of what you receive, but if, as most people do (and as the BBC does in their ""in the papers"" sections), you actively filter your media, then you'll find that the world's not quite as full of shit as you might like to believe.

Claiming that all newspapers are terrible is one of these self-fulfilling prophecies that can only help destroy quality journalism.  There are still good papers left, and, sure, you need to be aware of the biases that will inherently be there, but if you use some ounce of common sense you'll find that there is still plenty of worthwhile commentary and reporting to be found in print journalism.  The more you complain that the newspapers are dead, the sooner they will be, and then our news will end up being gleaned from two-a-penny, self-selected blogs that tell us exactly what we want to hear, and we'll be left wondering why all the critical thinking seems to have disappeared from the world.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"the thing worth bearing in mind is that when you sign up for a 2 year fixed, you will likely take a new mortgage in 2 year's time. you won't stay on the SVR for 28 years, more likely you'll pay it for a month or two depending on how organised you are, and you'll then fix again for another 2-3 years. 
there's two points here: first, you can't really compare these two products over a 30 year period to see which is cheaper. It is highly unlikely you'll have this mortgage for 30 years (and you can't predict base rate anyway). A better comparison is to compare the 2 year fixed rate plus the admin fees for remortgaging vs the tracker for 24 months and see where you get to.  this requires the assumption that you will be able to remortgage (ie: house price drop hasn't burnt your equity), and you have to make a base rate assumption, but it's closer to real life i would say.  You could also figure out the break even base rate rise to make the two equivalent, and see if that it sounds plausible to you.

the second (cynical) point is that a lifetime tracker is likely to last you longer than a 2 year fixed rate.  if base rate doesn't move, then you will have little incentive to remortgage, which means no admin fees for the bank in 2 year's time, and no client fees for the mortgage provider. which may explain their reluctance to recommend it...

as a final point, if someone in that position tells you it's a bad idea, ask them why. they should be able to explain it to you rather than just say ""it isn't recommended in your situation"".",null,0,null,1435759140,null,0,false,0,csoo71f,null,t3_3bqqcg,null,t1_csoo71f,null,t3_3bqqcg,null,null,null,1437490316,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

* The Opposition objects
* Other parties object
* The electorate objects

If he wants to leave for European football then he really should be holding out for a Champions League club. While I understand there is an 'allure' to Liverpool, even with all their transfers this summer I think they'll be way of the pace of the top four next season.


Annoying thing is, if they hadn't changed the rules last season then we'd be playing European football this season as FA Cup runners-up. Even more annoying, if we'd won the FA Cup then Liverpool would have had to go through an extra qualifying round for the Europa League and we would have entered at a later stage than them. And even more annoying than that, we'd have a trophy for Benteke to celebrate too. Damn that bloody FA Cup final.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degloving

&gt;A degloving injury is a type of avulsion in which an extensive section of skin is completely torn off the underlying tissue, severing its blood supply. It is named by analogy to the process of removing a glove.

Basically imagine ripping back your skin, and that's what the dogs do to the foxes, often the fox is held alive and the dogs do that to each of its limbs before it finally dies from shock and trauma.

Hunting foxes is a necessary part of agricultural maintenance. Hunting with dogs and not shooting is utterly abhorrent and sickening.

Make it quick, make it clean, end the suffering.

Aren't women all about dolling themselves up in nice dresses and make-up in order to make themselves feel good? No one complains about make-up or perfume adverts which *could* imply that women are ugly and smell bad. 

This advert is no worse than all the summer editions of Cosmo, Glamour, et al, which tell woman what diets hey should be following, or what exercises they should be doing to get ready for the summer.

&gt;All women should be catered for at the same time.

Absolute nonsense. What about 80 year-old Mabel, sitting in her rocking chair, should she be catered for? What about 45 year-old Elizabeth, mother of five, should she be catered for?

No. 

This is advertising. No one complains when other adverts aren't targeted toward them and this should be no different.

null,false,FrozenOx,null,null,null,"&gt; When Suarez talks about BR like this it reaffirms by belief in his capability.

Well, this is what I should have referred to when mentioning whether BR is a ""man manager"". These Suarez quotes don't really confirm anything for me, because the Agger comments in them and how he was handled (given these quotes about the ball on the floor system) seem to contradict how that situation played out. And as for tactics, it does nothing for me either. Brendan's tactics are extremely predictable. We'll switch formations only after weeks or even months of bad results, and then it'll work well for a while (Diamond to 4-3-3) until every team in the league knows how we'll line up next week. Then results became poor again until we switch again. That was last season though, and we were much more static than when we had Suarez et. al. looking to exploit space. So Suarez quotes mean little to the current situation. I hope next season Firmino will help bring back that attacking dynamism we lacked for half of last season. But the Suarez era is over, and last season saw a huge change in the first team coupled with injuries and us trying to rediscover a cohesion on the field. And we're doing it all over again, huge first team changes (hopefully for the better) and looking to rediscover a cohesion on the field.

Yeah, 13/14 season. IMO Agger should have stayed one more and the Lovren signing then and now makes no sense to me, but it's a tough position to walk into in a first team and Lovren still has a lot he can prove. Reminds me of how we let Hyypia go and sign Kyrgiakos to replace him when he had another season in him. With BR I just hope last season was a learning curve that is not repeated.

That's not just for running courses, it's for equipment, maintenance, utilities, administration.... everything. 

This fact got rather drowned out by claims of greedy universities charging more but not increasing the value for money, forgetting that in reality there was much less money to spend. Consider that the year that an institutions budget was wholly connected to student numbers was also the year that application number dropped dramatically as students and parents were faced with triple the cost.

Counter to the '**Attack on my privacy**' argument. Compare the position to your own home. As things stand your home is your private space BUT if the police suspect you're up to no good they can apply for a court order to enter your house against your will. You can put up enough security as you like but if they *really* want to get in, the state has enough resources to get past any security you put up. Is that an attack on your privacy?

Counter to the '**We don't need it, Britain is safe**' argument: There haven't been any major terrorist incidents since 2007 so why do we need it? Well how many terrorists incidents would there have been if the security services weren't mass-scouring emails? The nature of that work means we have no way of knowing. Definitely more than 1 though.

The '**It's not feasible' argument - part 1 you can't stop it**: While the government couldn't stop string encryption any more than they've stopped people taking drugs they certainly *could* ban it. That would mean that it would not be legal to buy apps like whatsapp in their current form. Would that stop the most determined / well funded / smartest terrorists? No. Would it stop the bumbling / delusional / thick home-grown terrorists? Maybe...

The '**It's not feasible' argument - part 2 the internet needs it**: It's important to distinguish between encryption that can be unlocked by a third party (eg your bank / amazon / google etc etc) and encryption that can only be unlocked by you people nominated by you. It's the second type that they're proposing to ban.

There are other arguments. The government doesn't have a good reputation in terms of its own data management.

I'm not saying that Nazi party was a fringe movement at all, I'm saying that a group much smaller than Islam required a global conflict to bring it down, Nazism wasn't destroyed by mockery and criticism.

&gt; For religion to decline you must be able to mock it, and criticize it.

Religion decline in the west isn't due to it being mocked it's due to it not being relevant to modern lives, and thus largely ignored.

&gt; Because race, and ideology are two different things. Tolerating Nazism wouldn't lead to tolerance, and neither does tolerating religion.

You brought up both Nazi and Racism, I never implied that you should tolerate either of those, i simply meant you should try be tolerant of other peoples race and beliefs regardless of how immoral or wrong they are they still have the right to believe them. Like we thanks to freedom as speech have the right to mock them, however that doesn't mean we should go out of our way to do so we already have laws against hate speech for that purpose. hence my original point that in some circumstances being deliberately provocative is completely unnecessary and petty.

He was to be rewarded by being made head of the IMF.
David Cameron used his veto and claimed the world recession was started by labour instead. 
With the backing of Murdoch and the other billionaire newspaper barons all they had to do was just keep repeating that labour recession and tory growth and that's that.

Points that I believe are unfitting of a football club:

Refusing to sell to Celtic: Utd have decided fuck our players, our squad, even if a move to Celtic will advance your career or improve your life, we dont care, we only care about us and what impact selling said player to a rival has on us. See Cech to Arsenal for how a real football club should handle it (and I hate Chelsea).

They insist on holding onto players who do not want to be there, there is unwritten rules in football and you should always do the best for the players who have entrusted their career to you. Utd do not do this. I dont dislike Utd fans they are great but the club as a whole operates like twats. I dislike liverpool for the same reason so its not even got to do with Ciftci.

So no I wont sugar coat my feelings and I assure you I am not the only one to hold them. Ultimatley i hope it bites them in the ass as every potentially amazing youth player refuses to sign any deal 2 year or greater and if I was a football agent thats how I would be advising my client.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Armed police are not unique to London. All areas are covered by armed response units so this contingency is already in place.

Defense planning usually works by assessing the threat of something, and putting in place an appropriate response. As certain threats look more likely, the response is scaled up. Think of a military example like the Falkland islands - when Argentina go quiet for a few years the garrison is stretched thin. When they start with the inflammatory rhetoric the garrison is scaled back up. Planning for terrorist actions is similar... You don't just look at what *could* happen - because you end up with an infinite number of threats and you can't possibly plan for all of them. Instead they assess threats and formulate responses that scale to the most likely. 

I think its fair to say that London is by a great margin the most likely place for an attack. It's a global city, and one of the most universally recognizable places on the planet. It's also home to about 15% of our entire population and can be thought of as target rich both in terms of iconic/cultural locations and the volume of people. However, there have previously been attacks in other cities particularly by the IRA. You may also recall the [2007 Glasgow International Airport Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Glasgow_International_Airport_attack) by two islamist terrorists.

It's worth remembering, police in France are heavily armed by comparison to our police - and they also have a paramilitary police force called the [Gendarmerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie) which we don't really have an equivalent of, but is similar to an organization like the FBI in the USA. Despite that it didn't stop their police getting [killed in the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/07/247A769F00000578-2900259-image-a-62_1420637332528.jpg).

I suspect our current breakdown probably works something like this for areas outside of London;

* Police would respond first to calls of an attack as they would anywhere in the world, if only to get eyes on the situation. A lot of police are armed with tasers but in the event of shots being fired I suspect their role would be to call for armed response and setup a perimeter to try and contain the attackers. 

* Armed response units would be called and I think they are meant to have a response time of something like 10-20 minutes. These guys are on standby anyway for everything from a domestic dispute with a knife to drug related violence.

* One would imagine there is probably a troop of SAS/SBS (about 15 men) that are on some sort of rapid stand-by (maybe under an hour or something like that) to respond to a mumbai-style terrorist attack, and possibly a squadron (about 65-70 men) on a slower ~2+ hours standby.

It's worth pointing out that our main strategy does not seem to be to militarily defeat a mumbai style attack... it's to detect it before it happens and arrest the perpetrators at 5am in the morning with 50 armed police.

The first was in Lancashire. I approached it with the idea that it was going to be ""speed kills"", and I wasn't going to learn anything. But actually, it wasn't like that at all. They started off by saying ""You're here because of one of three things. Either you didn't know the limit, or you didn't know how fast you were going, or you knew the limit and knew how fast you were going but didn't care. If you're in the third group, there's not much we can do for you, but we're here to help people in the first two groups"". It was followed by a really informative theory session, then a short drive with an instructor. Really interesting, really useful. I learned things I didn't know before, and became a better driver.

The second one was in the Thames Valley. And it was exactly what I feared the first one would be. ""Speed kills. If you do 30 in a 30 zone you're safe, but if you do 31 you'll kill a child"".

Hopefully yours will be more like the first one I went to.

- Bobbi Brown Intensive Skin Supplement - a sample of this did just amazing things to my skin, particularly around the tops of my cheeks/eyes. Waiting until I travel to get it in duty free at the airport.

A truly amazing and humble man whose actions mean there are now thousands of people alive today when you include the offspring of those he saved.

He had to pay £50 per child to guarantee that each child would be granted entry to the UK as well as find a foster family for each and every one of the 669 children, trying desperately not to separate siblings such that they were sent to the same family. In today's money that is **£2,032,883!!**. I used [this historical inflation calculator](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1633409/Historic-inflation-calculator-value-money-changed-1900.html) to see what his expenditure was in today's money.

A sad day indeed that he has passed away albeit at a grand old age of 106. The world needs more like him.

There is also a film dramatising his exploits called [Nicky's Family](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1961438/).

On your point about our defenders. No one called them world class when we signed them but they were very solid tanks. Also Sakho has nailed a starting spot on the team so not sure why you said neither has.

Also I doubt we are in for a defensive midfield.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"I think the other thing is that actually, in that sort of scenario time is often *not* of the essence.

If you have an active spree shooter (e.g. Cumbria), then time *is* of the essence, but local Armed Response Police can handle that. Two separate subjects would stretch them, more than that and yes, you're probably in trouble.

By contrast, if we're dealing with a group of terrorists taking over a high-profile location in Manchester or Edinburgh in the style of the Mumbai attacks, even if you're in London the *armed* response is going to be at least 5+ minutes if the attackers have selected their target carefully. Outside of London, it will probably be longer, which is *more* than long enough for armed attackers to walk into a hotel, start shooting, make the staff lock the front doors and set off some bombs.

At that point you're into a hostage/siege situation, so it's more than adequate for local Police (regular and armed) to surround and isolate the location, whilst specialist Counter-Terror teams fly in (and probably the SAS as well to sit on the sidelines in case the Police request their assistance).

In the scheme of things, once you're into hostage negotiations, whether the CT teams are on site in 20 minutes or 2 hours wouldn't normally make that much difference. They're not going to go storming in blind without scouting the site and prepping their access points/routes anyway. Obviously they want to be on site as quickly as possible, but an hour or two is acceptable.

Bear in mind the Iranian Embassy Siege lasted 6 days. The Mumbai hostage situations were 12-24 hour affairs with attacks in the evening of the 26th, and resolved by the end of the 27th.

Manchester is 100 miles from Hereford, and Edinburgh is ~270miles. Immediate Action teams could be jumping on helicopters within 15-30 minutes of getting the call, and barrelling up there at 160-180mph (normal cruise speeds for Merlin &amp; Chinook helicopters), so you're looking at local Police on the scene in 5-15 minutes, but even the crack CT teams will only be 1-2 hours behind, which is not very long once the site is surrounded and secured.",null,0,null,1435766856,null,0,false,0,csosumg,null,t3_3bqnbx,null,t1_csosumg,null,t1_csokyoa,null,null,null,1437493821,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

While wrestling being scripted, the Screwjob was a match between him and another legend Shawn Michaels back in 1997 at a big event.

Bret was made World Champ a couple of months prior by WWF owner Vince McMahon, because of Brets desire to leave the company after 14 years. Vince thought that the title would keep him in WWF, but he still wanted to leave. Shawn and Bret had had a feud on and off screen for some time, because Shawn had declined losing the belt to Bret. So now Bret won't lose the belt to Shawn at this event, so they - and Vince, come to an agreement, where the match would end in a DQ, which lets the champion keep his belt. Bret would then forfeit the belt later on.

On to the match. At some point Shawn uses Brets own submission move on him, and Vince calls to the ref to stop the match, despite Bret not submitting to the move. The match ends and Shawn is given the belt, Bret one of the greatest wrestler, if not the greatest, left the company after those 14 years on bad terms with Vince and Shawn.

On January 4 2010 Bret made his comeback to WWF/WWE and later stitched things up with Shawn.",null,0,null,1435767129,null,0,false,0,csot17r,null,t3_3boxyj,null,t1_csot17r,null,t1_csosjwo,null,null,null,1437493948,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

&gt;Counter to the 'Attack on my privacy' argument. 

Do the police require your home to be made of glass, *just in case* you might be up to something naughty? There are things I don't want my other half to know about, let alone the government, so yes, it is an attack on my privacy, which I, and you, and everyone else, has a right to.

&gt;Counter to the 'We don't need it, Britain is safe' argument:

Yeah, nice bent logic there. The current methods are working (and the UK is already considered an ""enemy of civil liberties"" by several bodies). In addition I agree with Ben Franklin's statement: ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""

&gt;The 'It's not feasible' argument - part 1 you can't stop it

Banning encryption would make 0 difference. How many companies in the States conform to the CFR15.7C restriction on exports of encryption software &gt; 128b as munitions? Er, none, because it's completely unenforceable.

I'll be long gone by the day that pulling `apt-get install openssl` on my server earns me a knock at the door by the security services.

&gt;The 'It's not feasible' argument - part 2 the internet needs it

I use PGP because on occasion I handle sensitive data. Part of my current contract includes vulnerability research. Say for the sake of argument, I find an exploit in Firefox, a big one, that allows an attacker full access to your machine. Under an encryption ban, considering the restrictions you yourself propose, where only the two endpoints have access to the key, I would not be able to use PGP therefore the source of the message would not be able to be verified and I would have to send the exploit code in the clear. That gets into the wrong hands and the potential is there for multiple £b of damage. Do you not see the problem?

&gt;It no doubt would harm the UK industry

Understatement of the century.

&gt;given the Tories wafer thin majority they're not going to be trying anything so controversial any time soon.

I disagree. The opposition is split. Labour and the SNP are at each others' throats constantly. If anything, it's in the Tories' best interests if they want this to go through to do this as quickly as possible while the dust settles on the opposition benches.

So yeah. No. Don't defend this move. It's stupidity of the highest order.

I have cycled on the roads and yes it can be horrible - but if I need to go on the pavement I get off my bike.

null,false,Ivor_y_Tower,null,null,null,"Universities need to run a surplus and have reserves, they aren't public bodies, they are only publicly regulated. If a University hits financial troubles it goes out of business unless it has reserves available to it. 

Tuition fees are high because the Universities are not publicly funded in the same ways that European counter parts are. 

&gt; Most courses outside STEM degrees do not cost more then £3,000 to run yet are exploited by University.

No, not even close to true. A mid-tier academic in the UK is paid around £45,000 a year (massively variable) and most institutions have a work load model that would need at least two of them to run a 120 credit course (if they were teaching full time) so that's 90,000 in salary off the bat. You could argue that requires 30 students at 3k each to run but that isn't even close to the true cost because it ignores the many other costs that are needed to deliver a course such as internal moderation, external moderation, external accreditation, admissions handling, postgraduate teaching and marking support, degree awarding, timetabling of teaching, registration of students, etc.

Then there's less direct costs like a building to teach in, a library for you to find books in, your subscriptions to academic journals (worth around 2k a year although that's not the total paid) and computer clusters to work in.

Beyond this, there are other costs that are not part of the specific teaching course you are on including student wellbeing support, administrative staff, the student union facilities and subsidies to it (if any) and some of the bursaries the university offers.

Then there's costs you  would disagree with such as advertising your degree programme, running around 8 Open Days a year, advertising over seas, etc. 
 
Then there are estates and running costs on top of all of these other costs.

Then there's the fact this is a *massive* simplification and more complexity means more expense.

&gt; We are the only country in Europe to have these and as someone who have been to Uni in other European countries, our education system show no better success then theres even at the higher cost.

This isn't true either, UK Universities are consistently ranked higher than most EU counterparts:

https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking/#/

There are 7 UK Universiites in the top 50 Globally compared to 4 from other EU countries. 

ETA: in addition, all the EU countries that do have a Uni in the top 50 other than the UK spend more in total per student than the UK does in total:

http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2014_eag-2014-en#page206

It just doesn't seem like that because they fund their tuition through taxes rather than direct student fees.

This is total bullshit.

What they are actually trying to do is record *all* conversations so that they can be inspected retroactively when someone becomes a suspect. This is *not at all* possible with existing communications - telephone, letters, speaking in person etc. With these, you have to wait until someone becomes a suspect before you can start monitoring them. It should be the same with encrypted communications - find suspects, get a warrant, compromise the communication endpoints.

Implementing the same level of surveillance for these mediums as the government wants for electronic communications would require:

* recording every phone call
* opening and scanning every letter
* micing every conversation

This obviously doesn't happen,  because it's insanely draconian.

(Note: the current legislation is closer to 'we'll mic every conversation, but we won't actually turn them on - promise!'. You can see where they're going though.

Encryption is used very frequently on websites for security purposes. Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit are migrated or migrating too HTTPS, which uses encryption. Under the new law that Cameron has proposed, all of these, or the HTTPS versions would be banned.

So why is he doing this? He is doing so due to the war on terrorism. It is the 21st century. The internet and social media are very big and furthermore, global. When you send a message on Facebook, that is encrypted so that nobody can hack into Facebook's servers and have a look.

If it is interest on a savings account then it is treated as income for that year and will be taxed accordingly, unless it is in an ISA. You have a large yearly ISA allowance, so it is worth considering using that to avoid tax, though the likelihood is that even with 40% tax that you may still earn more from a 3% santander 123 account than from the awful ISA rates that are around.

If it is dividends on stocks then it is also income for the year but dividends are taxed a little different, which you'd need to look into. Stocks and shares  ISAs can help shield you from this too.

If it is capital gains such as from an increased in stock value then that is shielded in a S&amp;S ISA but otherwise subject to capital gains tax, which is only taxed when the profit is realised via selling and you'll have a fair amount tax-free for a year anyway. That will be 18% or 28% on stuff over the limit normally, which I think will be 28% for you as you are a higher-rate earner.

In terms of pooling your income, I'm much less sure of that and I'd be very careful in researching that and maybe get professional advice if you go down that route.

Well every doc or hosp appoint i have been to on 45 years has run late. Every time something has kept the docs past the allocated time needed for each appoint before mine. 

So every practice would be open much later if all appointments turned up?

So we dont have docs sat waiting with no work to do. 

The only other issue I can think of is that consultants and docs are privrate. So paid per patient. And they charge the NHS even if you fail to turn up. 

Ok if that is the case. Again if all turned up they prolly would not get you in. So they seem to be allowing for this in the shedule. Seems reasonable that we reevaluate how we pay them so that late service gets a discount. ?

* **The Fades** [British] *A teenage boy named Paul is haunted by apocalyptic dreams that nobody can explain. As if that weren't terrifying enough, he begins to see spirits of the dead, known as The Fades, all around him. The Fades can't be seen, smelt, heard or touched by other humans. When an embittered and vengeful Fade, Polus, finds a way to be human again, it's up to Paul to stop him - and all of the dead - from breaking back into the world and destroying the human race.*
