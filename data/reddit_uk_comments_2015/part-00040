The company stakes its reputation on it.

I also dislike the false dichotomy of support animal cruelty or don't eat meat. There is surely a sliding scale, and you would say that an animal which lived a wonderful life in a field, never hungry or thirsty, and was humanely slaughtered has to come in pretty low on it. 

If we are getting in to ethical arguments, many of these animals wouldn't be born and exist were it not for them being reared for slaughter, so is 3 or 4 years of life at an excellent standard better than 0 years at all?

When it comes down to it, we breed them for slaughter. The least we can do is make that final part as humane as possible, and I don't think 2 more seconds of pain is part of that. On the other side, I'm not opposed to changes to the process which would lead to less suffering for the animals, I just don't believe Halal is.

I also firmly believe most Halal meat is churned out of places that don't even do it properly, just to satisfy an existing market... much as many abattoirs treat animals terribly. Business is business after all. I support an end to the cruel practices.

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"This kind of question does highlight how much we don't know about many of the DW monsters.  

Anyway, lets look at some of the major monsters from NuWho, and assume that they attack modern Earth.

**Daleks** - they have been seen (probably more in the earlier shows and comics) to keep slave races once they have conquered their planet. Some might be ""robotised"" or puppetised or whatever, but unless the Daleks actually want to use the whole planet as a weapon or otherwise destroy it, I would think that we would survive as slaves. In just about all cases like this that we have seen, there is an active resistance too, although in some cases that is allowed, and even controlled by the Daleks to provide hope, and therefore improve morale in the slaves.  

**Cybermen** - Although there have been a few instances where humans have been seen to fight off and contain early cybermen with some sucess, it seems likely that their continuous upgrading would eventually give them the ability to overcome any effective human resistance and convert just about everybody. However, what then for the cybermen? If, as they started out, they are only looking to convert Humans, what happens when they've converted the lot? How long do cybermen survive? Can they keep the organic components alive forever, or do they eventually die/wear out and need replacing?

If the latter, then we have to ask whether they can reproduce by themselves, or whether they need to keep a breeding stock of un-converted humans to breed from?

If they can survive without needing replacement brains to be grown (and we have seen them going into cold-storage for quite some time, at least), or they move on to convert other races, and not just humans, then we may be finished, except that we've seen a few examples of the conversion process not working completely, and emotions remaining. So even if we don't survive as breeding stock, we may survive in the form of a scattering of rogue cybers with faulty inhibitors.  

**Sontarans** - seems mainly to be interested in the Earth as a strategic resource/position, rather than humans themselves so, again there is some likelyhood that we could survive as a slave labour force, I'd think, or simply left to scatch a living in the remains of our world once the Sontaran/Rutan conflict has passed through - unless they decide that Earth is too valuable to fall into Rutan possession, and so destroy it completely.

**Angels** - So, an appreciable number of them arrive on Earth now. They start sending folk back a few generations. The present population declines. The Angels allow a breeding stock to survive. They take most of the children - having their parents blind them at birth - and feed on their long potential futures.

he population in the early twentieth century increases. Many of the newcomers are blind children. Food and housing are in increasing demand. Some of the incomers are adults and have the knowledge to improve technology so, after a short lag, food output increases as the ""green revolution"" and artificial fertilisers come into play earlier. However, wages crash with the increased number of people looking for work. The depression in 1930s in much, much worse. As the blinded ones reach an age where they can work, society begins to adapt to the sightless. Many more people leave cities and return to work in the newly abundant fields. Although knowledge of automation is now available, it makes little sense, when so many people are available and willing to work for so little.  

Rumours of the angels in the future abound, but little can be done to prepare defences. All statues are destroyed and it becomes illegal to make more - or any figure even vaguely humanoid.  

With wages so low, taxes provide little public funding, and state services are strained to the point of collapse. Pensions are pitifully small even where available. As result, even though many governments start campaigns to promote birth control, and persuade couples to adopt the sightless new arrivals, the poor increasingly do have seeing children so that they can support them in old age. The population continues to increase. The economy collapses, again through low wages and so much poverty. There is little opportunity or incentive to invest in the new technological knowledge that people have brought with them from the future, and progress stagnates. State funding for education is minimal, and the population increasingly becomes subject to superstition and cults based around the angels and other rumours of future events. Cults of ""Watchers"" spring up among the seeing as the date when the Angels first arrived approaches. Many will cut their eyelids off and have acolytes to mist their eyes and others to hold lanterns as they prepare to defend Earth. 

In the new timeline, the Angels arrive on a poverty-stricken, cult-dominated, rural earth, where they are soon surrounded by Watchers and their acolytes. Sacred temples develop around them, with eternal fires and dedicated watchers.

By this time, all of the technological knowledge from the old timeline has been lost, and the earth has been set back by 2-3 centuries.  

Development is slow to resume, but it does. As the new rationalism takes over, superstitions regarding living statues fall out of favour. Eternal fires are doused, no-one wats to become a Watcher anymore, and temple are demolished. Bans on creating statues are overturned, and one by one the Angles disappear to prey on humans once more. In the early days, tales of attacks are dismissed as old legends , and by the time that it is happening on a large scale once more, well the cycle is underway and continues and continues...

But there is an balance which most people don't see. Acute care is amazing because that's where the money and effort goes. Buy try having a long term illness - something painful but not life threatening - and you'll'see a different story which is not talked about in papers or parliament.

Your first challenge will be to stay alive. This is more difficult than you think; by the time I was fifteen I'd almost been killed three times and I'd seen two of my best friends die at the hands of NHS staff who simply didn't give a shit.

While patients with broken legs and sore heads are whisked through in moments with a flourish in front of press photographers, you will'wait many months for basic procedures, NHS staff will write""time waster"" and ""attention seeker"" on your notes, further delaying treatment and ensuring you are treated like dog shit by all'but the most dedicated staff members.

Imagine if a party said that they were going to raise personal allowance to £50k, triple NHS spending, make university free, and schooling for adults free.  You would have to ask, how is that going to work, who is going to pay for it.

null,false,TooLeft,null,null,null,"&gt; I disagree that the least we can do is make their final moments as humane as possible. The very least we are required to do by basic standards of ethics is to ensure their lives are as cruelty free as possible AND their deaths as humane as possible. People who are only concerned with the latter strike me as having a serious ulterior motive, especially when they only get so worked up about Islamic slaughter practices (Western practices are probably better, but they're by no means painless or dignified). At the very least those people are ethically squeamish; they don't like the 'nasty' business of slaughter but are happy to collude in the maltreatment of animals when they can kid themselves it's not happening.

But in fairness I just wrote a whole post saying I don't support those practices, and made the effort to find a farmer who doesn't mistreat his animals. It's not one or the other, there is no difference in quality of life for the animals I eat vs ones slaughtered by Halal other than the extra moments of cruelty in an already cruel death.

&gt;So I don't think criticism of Muslims for this is sickening, but I do think people who criticise Muslims for their 'barbaric' practice and then go and tuck into a steak (without at least knowing how the cow lived and died) are sickening, because not only are they hypocrites, but using animal suffering as an instrumental good in a political fight.

As a race we have adopted the hypocritical position of do no harm but still eat meat, it's a pointless argument to say that because of that, I can't point to the fact that one group wants to do it an even worse way (IMO of course).",null,0,null,1422709845,null,0,false,0,co6pnme,null,t3_2u6i0o,null,t1_co6pnme,null,t1_co6pjom,null,null,null,1424290194,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,tusksrus,,Blairite,null,"Ah they're not the sort of thing I tend to save, honestly - but they're reasonably common.

For example, [this Independent on Sunday poll](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9923392.ece/alternates/w1024/10-Poll1.jpg) ([article here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poll-shows-voters-believe-ukip-is-to-the-left-of-the-tories-9923416.html)). That's not got *all* the UK parties worth talking about - but I'd put the SNP somewhere between the Lib Dems and Labour, and Plaid somewhere between Labour and the Greens. It also doesn't have the Northern Ireland parties, but they're largely ignored by mainland UK anyway. I'd ignore Russell Brand and Prince Charles (in general, but the graph as well). I'd also question the placement of UKIP and the Conservatives in relation to each other - but after all, that was what they made the story out of.

[This is a commonly cited two-dimensional one](http://i.imgur.com/n3zLve8.png), but it's just as bad as the first one (I'll get onto that in a minute), though at least it has most parties, even Respect!

Anyway, the problem with placing political parties on a left-right spectrum in relation to each other in a quantified way (distance represents political distance), is that how left or right wing someone is (let alone a *group* of people) is fundamentally not quantifiable.

They also tend to be made by someone with prejudices against a particular party (or many) and a point to make about them, meaning that these are simply a representation of their opinion - which is always better suited to a few lines of text explaining than drawing a picture. That's the main reason why they're terrible - most of the ones posted on Reddit, at least.

Personally I hate them because they are an attempt to place parties on an axis which is a massive oversimplification of the diverse views parties have *and people within those parties have*. Who is more right-wing, the guy who believes abortion shouldn't be legal except for medical reasons but believes in a strong welfare state, or the guy who believes abortion should be legal for anybody who wants it, but that healthcare should only be provided through private insurance, and that out-of-work benefits promote laziness? Most people don't really fit comfortably on a left-right axis, even if they are *broadly* left or right wing. 

So it's *really* blurry, and what's more, parties are groups of peoople - *large* groups of people. You can't put a lot of blurry individuals together, making a very large blurry object, and place it next to other blurry objects - largely overlapping - and place them as points on a one-dimensional axis.

What you can do is read a paragraph or two about each political party's major beliefs and principles and goals, and you'd be more informed than a graph could give you - because it's fundamentally not a graphable thing, and rarely meaningful at all.",null,0,null,1422710556,null,0,false,0,co6ptkg,null,t3_2uaubo,null,t1_co6ptkg,null,t1_co6piv3,null,null,null,1424290117,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Even during the Roman Empire, which we like to imagine was a utopia and all clean and nice and whatever else, very little was different from how we also like to imagine the middle ages. Life was brutal, disease was rampant, 90% or more of the population worked in back-breaking agriculture for 16 hours a day 24/7. Even the upper classes had their own problems, usually in the form of being broke and owing obscene amounts of money.

In this context it isn't hard to understand why Christianity and other Abrahamic religions would become popular. It was a promise of something more, something better for people after their short awful lives had ended. 

As for why it endured well, again for most of human history this state of affairs didn't change. The poor stayed poor and downtrodden, 90+% of the population devoted to harsh agricultural work, rampant disease, low life expectancy, constant warfare etc. However; when this stuff did change well, organised religion has had thousands of years to entrench itself. It's pretty difficult for it to die suddenly, especially when our era of prosperity is relatively short in the grand scheme of things. People are Christian (or religious whatever) because their parents are and their parents were as were their parents before them. And so on.

null,false,matthemod,eng-kent,Kent,null,"I've (unfortunately) had the pleasure of using both the American Healthcare system, and the NHS for two separate but very similar injuries (broken fingers) and I can tell you the difference is very similar, yet very different.

In the states I was told not to call an ambulance because they would charge you, so I was dropped off at the hospital by a friend and had to wait 2-3 hours in a small, provincial hospital in Southern Indiana.  They did everything they could to my finger, x-rays, an injection underneath my knuckle to reduce swelling, plenty of painkillers, and at the end a lot of physiotherapy sessions at a separate P.T. centre.  Then came the bills, I had insurance but even with my co-pay, I had to pay about $1500 overall for the procedures and the rehab sessions.

In the U.K. a couple of years later I went to A&amp;E in Medway Maritime, one of the worst in the country according to recent reports, and had to wait 5 hours (but it was a Saturday night).  I had some x-rays taken, and was told that it was broken.  It was nearly a carbon copy of my American break, just on the other hand.  So they prescribed me painkillers and what they call ""trousers"" which is a small cloth which binds your fingers together to stop them moving.  I was then given rehab sessions with the fracture clinic and a nifty uniquely moulded plastic finger protector, which replaced the trousers I had been given at A&amp;E.  That was the end of it.

In my opinion the American system is thorough to the extreme.  They did absolutely everything possible to ensure I was covered, but at the same time I did wonder just how much of it was strictly necessary.  It was clean and relatively fast, but then it was a small hospital in a small town in a small state.  The N.H.S. was a longer wait, and really I got the impression it was more matter of fact.  ""This is what's wrong with you, this is what we're going to do"", not in a negative way, just in a practical Saturday night in A&amp;E way.

At the end of it all, I received similar treatment for the same injury, just one cost me $1500 and a lot of billing headaches in the long run.

tl;dr Same injury treated in U.S. and U.K., American system did a lot more and cost me $1500, U.K. did what was necessary and was a little bit longer wait.

Frankly, driving scares the living shit out of me and I won't do it. When my sugar gets too high, I get very drowsy very uncontrollably. I've fallen asleep/passed out in the middle of phone conversations at work, despite a monumental effort to stay awake and I always get yawny and head-droppingly sleepy on public transport. The very idea of doing this while driving is horrifying.

When you go hypo, usually the first indication you get is the shakes, accompanied with fuzzy headedness, a bit like being very drunk. Everyone's different, but with a glucose level of 1.5, I'm not surprised she passed out. It can happen so rapidly that you don't have time to do anything about it. She may have had something on her to combat it, like a bottle of Lucozade or something, but even that wouldn't have worked fast enough on a short car trip.

What she should have done, which is true of someone who has a coughing fit, also, is slam the brakes on and hit the hazards. I don't drive, I've had two lessons and that's it, and even I could do that without thinking or looking, so as bad as the whole affair is, she really doesn't have an excuse.

I'll assume she's type 1, insulin dependent diabetic, which I don't knwo much about, but if she's type 2, then she'll be on pills that specifically warn against driving and handling heavy machinery.

My dad was always very clear on his responsibilities and very careful to manage his condition. It sucks that someone has diabetis and it's not fair.

I think if we're all atheists we really shouldn't be using such subjective and philosophical terms as ""good"" and ""evil"" without qualifiers. It does no 'good' to state that if there is a God he/she/it is 'evil'.

edit: Just to answer your first point - plenty of Christians claim to speak for their Christ and yet their Christ would claim to not know them:

Matt 7:21-23 ""Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’""

Need Barry to step up now and avoid a booking if McCarthy is going to be out for a few more weeks, one more booking and it's a two match ban for him.

Edit: Hopefully McCarthy is just being saved for the derby, but as a blue you've always got to expect the worst.",null,0,null,1422713393,null,0,1422713704,0,co6qk65,null,t3_2uazay,null,t1_co6qk65,null,t3_2uazay,null,null,null,1424289772,null,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5,null

We could say 'fuck you, we don't care what you think, you're wrong', which is pretty much the tone of this article, but what will happen next time Costa does something that just crosses the line, banned. We can say again, ""not fair, you didn't ban player x"", but the FA have shown themselves not to be fair and it won't change anytime soon. We are entering into a battle we cannot win. 

We need to be cleverer than that in my opinion. Smile to their faces, tell them fuck you behind closed doors. When decisions are contentious they will go against Chelsea because of the relationship we have. Also the media have created this furor because of their relationship with Jose. Its the same everytime, media creates a storm and it makes it easier for the FA to ban or fine because of the public outcry.

I know this is a tactic to create a siege mentality by Jose, but I think theres two ways to do this:

1 - Negative - It's not fair, everyone is against us, you ban Diego but not Yaya, we have an excuse if we don't win because you were against us, fuck you!

or

2 - Positive - You're against us but we don't care, victory will be so much sweeter when we win, we control our own destiny  so fuck you!!

*Could of* is undeniably in common use and pretty much always understood by a native speaker. Interestingly, there's at least [one published linguistics paper](http://lib.gen.in/next/MTAuMTAyMy9hOjEwMjY0MzM5MDI3NDg=/10.1023_a%3A1026433902748.pdf) (PDF) arguing that some speakers might cognitively have an underlying form that functions more like *of* than *have*, making the 'incorrect' version a more accurate representation than the 'correct' one for those speakers. There's also that fact that, in speech, both the *of* and *have* constructions are almost always homophonous, being /ˈkʊdəv/ (often seen as *could've*).

That being said, a linguist might well also advise someone against using non-standard constructions like this in formal/academic writing as a result of lots of people considering them 'wrong' in that situation rather than anything to do with any inherent 'incorrectness' of the construction/word in question.",null,0,null,1422713714,null,0,false,0,co6qnlv,null,t3_2u84fp,null,t1_co6qnlv,null,t1_co6efaf,null,null,null,1424289729,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

At least you can transfer money between bank accounts now without waiting best part of a week for the fuckers to pull their thumbs out of their bums and make themselves some more money out of it before they'll let you get at it it. And do most of your banking online in the middle of the night and at weekends. 

Kids don't know they're born.

If you want an actual, helpful, suggestion, I used to have this problem paying cheques in: solution is go to the bank ONCE when it's open, make them give you a huge bundle of paying in slips and envelopes (they don't charge you), then you can shove 'em through the door at your leisure when the place is closed. They may have some damnfool policy against this now if their letterbox filled up with piss and kebabs, but there'll certainly be a freepost address you can use and they'll supply the envelopes.

Yields on most bonds are pretty pathetic at the moment and 3-5 years isn't really long enough for equities. If you plan to withdraw after that time you won't gain much from an ISA unless you're paying higher rate income tax, in which case it might be a better option - you can put £15k a year into an ISA, so most of that £1500/month could be protected from income tax if desired. 

It might be worth talking to a professional who understands the tax situation relating to pensions, tax-protected savings accounts etc. to see if there's some option that would work better in your particular situation - we don't know the details and can't really advise here. 

Also consider the currency risk - if you know you're going to be spending the money in some other currency, there's an argument to be made for converting to that currency early on, unless you have a very good reason to act otherwise. Exchange rates have the potential to create far bigger changes in the ultimate value of your money than the interest paid on savings. For example, if you'd been saving in GBP but planning to transfer to US Dollars or Swiss Francs, you'd have lost over 10% within the last half year.

He was also seen as an established player and used to the Premier League. He was also identified as a Leader by Rodgers and in training clips he did did act as one. 

That is not to say that he won't improve next season, he will improve next season but it's a damning indictment that Emre Can, a midfielder, and a Glen Johnson who's frankly awful can get ahead of our most expensive defender ever.

&gt;In the 1960s, controversial [Burnley F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) Chairman [Bob Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lord_(football_chairman\)) successfully convinced fellow [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.

&gt;As a result, [The FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_FA), [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) and [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Until recently, the FA Cup Final was an exception and had been broadcast at 3pm on a Saturday in May; however, in 2012, the FA Cup Final was moved to 5pm.

&gt;In the 1960s, controversial [Burnley F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) Chairman [Bob Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lord_(football_chairman\)) successfully convinced fellow [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.

&gt;As a result, [The FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_FA), [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) and [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Until recently, the FA Cup Final was an exception and had been broadcast at 3pm on a Saturday in May; however, in 2012, the FA Cup Final was moved to 5pm.

&gt;In February 2011, [Advocate General Kokott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliane_Kokott) of the [European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) opined that the ""closed periods"" did not encourage match attendance at other league games.

Its not also possible to flip and flop with decisions, sometimes you have to be bold, for better or for worse.

There's no real reason why he can't adapt to our game, but he's going to be competing directly with Sakho for a spot next to Skrtel. I'd say Skrtel is clearly our best defender just at the moment and it's a matter of finding the right complement for him. Skrtel falls apart if he's not in the right partnership; Sakho and he eem to be building a relationship now though and I think Sakho is the player who has the most long-term potential.

If we stick with three at the back, that third player is going to be a moonlighting midfielder like Can or Johnson, or I could see Wisdom in that role if he's with us next season.

In summary, I'd say Lovren was the wrong player to buy and it's not clear how he's going to get the game time to work his way into our system.",null,0,null,1422716162,null,0,false,0,co6rfuq,null,t3_2ub03n,null,t1_co6rfuq,null,t3_2ub03n,null,null,null,1424289362,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

There's no additional equipment required to watch standard digital television; you need a half modern TV, or a TV with a digital decoder. With Sky / Cable, you require additional hardware. That hardware then necessitates support staff, billing staff, engineers etc. etc.

At the risk of being labelled an ultracrepidarian [given that I've never subscribed to Sky, and the TV aerial connection in my house is behind two full bookcases] I'd imagine Sky make the vast majority of their income via subscriptions; advertising allows them to supplement this income, and allows to continue to outbid non-subscription channels for premium content.

There's also the fact that most commercial programming is written / directed, with advertising breaks factored in.

The problem with him is he's got talent - he's quick, aggressive, tackles well, etc. - but plays like he's never had a day of formal training. His positioning, communication and leadership, reading of the game, decision-making, etc. are at best random (and Liverpool at the moment isn't the place to be getting defensive training). I think that's a big part of why he was good for you, the likes of Schneiderlin and Wanyama offered excellent protection so he could focus on what he was best at, while Liverpool doesn't have a proper protective DM like that, let alone 2 excellent ones. So I think it's a combination of having more defensive responsibility than he's capable of shouldering and the problem every Liverpool CB is going to have, a lack of protection. 

In the short-term, the thing that could give him an opportunity to redeem himself is the 3-man defence. The current combination has done a lot to hide Skrtel's flaws and play towards his strengths (like your midfield did for Lovren last season), and I can see them doing so to some extent if he takes that central role.",null,0,null,1422716744,null,0,false,0,co6rncd,null,t3_2ub03n,null,t1_co6rncd,null,t3_2ub03n,null,null,null,1424289265,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

If you literally never go to the Doctor, then you're spending £2k more than you need to in the UK.

However, if you go to the Dr. more than, probably, a couple times a year then you're saving more in the UK.

Also, if you ever have any serious illness, you're saving thousands and possibly (probably) hundreds of thousands if you're in the UK.

Say you have one operation which costs 100k, that's 50 years worth of tax that you've just used. If you have to get another, well then you've ""profited"" from the NHS.

Not to mention that it feels completely shitty getting a bill for being unlucky. We had to put our dog down last year, and getting the bill for that really fucking sucked. I'd imagine it'd be much worse getting the bill for a family member who dies.

&gt; Worse still it is levied from our general taxes and yet is paid to landlords mostly in London and so is quite regressive.

Given that - statistically speaking - most of the country's population doesn't actually live in London, do you have any evidence for that?

I can believe that most of the high value properties that result on your ""Single mother on £90k housing benefit in Chelsea"" headlines will be in London, but I find it hard to believe that most of the landlords are in London and that most of the claimants are there too.

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"&gt;one story drawn out over several episodes.

Insofar as I have given this any detailed thought, I'd suggest that season 1 would be a scattering of different types of story, only loosely linked, to establish an audience, and see what they make of it.

In subsequent series, I'd agree: go with extended stories for half or whole seasons. The tone and direction that they take would be based on the audience reaction of the best of season 1.  

In fact, with (some of) the titles that I suggest here, I've kinda got a connecting arc in mind - a parallel earth (sort of Pete's World but not) moving into alignment and things crossing over. The first being the London underground thing in *Quake*. The alignment is what powers up the ley-lines, and the empty Earth of *Zero Day* would be a ""reflection"" caught somewhere between the two, etc.   

In subsequent seasons, the full effect of the alignment would be established and become the main story.  

It has the potential to be just another name for ""the rift"", I know, or even develop into something like *Sliders*, but, as I say, I've not given the whole idea too much thought at all.  

However, you are quite right that it is unrealistic to expect UNIT to be fighting off the invasion of the week every time, and even with overseeing new tech we can very easily slip into the ""just invasions and mad scientists"" issue again.  

It is tempting to get the team into the parallel world completely (or find that that is where they were from the start), and then follow through with a full-scale invasion. Turn them into the resistance, then eventually get into rebuilding etc, but it is drifting into *V, Survivors* &amp;  *The Walking Dead* etc etc, and not really connected to the DW universe too much.

null,false,woocheese,null,null,null,"I'm all for more taser's or similar to be made part of the standard kit for all front line police officers here is why:


Police officers respond to crimes in progress, often those crimes may be or may involve violence. So some sort of physical force may need to be used.
Everything done must be proportionate legal and necessary. 

Police personal protective equipment is basically:

-Stab Vest
-Cuffs
-Pepper Spray
-*Taser*
-Baton

Police carry equipment to balance the odds in their favour when things get physical. When someone is being verbally aggressive and we think things are about to get violent we can go hands on, use some spray etc. When things cross the line from just words and shoving to something more substantial, punches kicks, sustained attacks, using things as weapons. The level of force used increases as well.

For example if I am punched in the face and back off with my attacker still coming at me I would draw my baton, shout and if they still come at me strike them with it. I'm justified in doing so and anyone else would do the same. However in using the baton you are at serious risk of injuring or even killing the person you are hitting.

I love the idea of having another less lethal option to sort of go hand in hand with the pepper spray that is effective in stopping someone violent in their tracks causing them minimal injury. Its a much less dangerous tool than the baton and a much more effective tool than the spray!

Don't trust a cop to have a taser? Then why are they in the job?

In terms of terrorism I have no doubt in my mind that an attack will come in the UK soon, I would love to see taser's given to all PC's in front line roles as they work, as if we are the target of a knife attack on the street we have more of a fighting chance. However with all the further cuts the government has lined up for us I fear that if there is ever a Mumbai or Paris type attack in the UK the police will not be equipped to deal with it in the future.

Law's the originator of the [Evil God Challenge](http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A72V8TEm), wherein he observes that most Christian responses to the problem of suffering/evil can be flipped to defend belief in a god who is evil (where the analogous problem is ""why is there so much good?"") If we find it silly to think that there might be such a god, why aren't Christian responses equally silly?

In the debate, Craig retreats from the standard position that ""sunsets/stars, mighty thunder/love is evidence for God's goodness"" (because he knows that can be flipped: evil god will torture us all in the afterlife, so present goods are nothing in comparison; evil god wants us to have free will so we can choose evil, which must admit the possibility that some people do good instead; and so on) and ends up with his [Moral Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_morality) as the only one which actually addresses God's goodness: Craig's standard cosmological arguments don't, and so, even if they are provide no more support to the Christian God than to a bunch of other possibilities (Hume is good on this, read *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*, notably [this bit](http://www.davidhume.org/search.php?q=%22infant+deity%22&amp;D=on)).

The Moral Argument is pretty shaky: why think that moral absolutes can only be grounded in God?

Law's argument is clever because it goes to the heat of Craig's ""mysterious ways"" response and borrows it for something Craig certainly doesn't want to defend. 

&gt; This IS NOT a new criticism and has been thought about for thousands of years by some of the greatest church thinkers to have ever lived.

Also by having certain drugs illegal all we do is create a black market were gangs then compete with each other for territory and then this leads to violence. 

If we use the resources we're using now on policing cannabis and other drugs instead to help people with addiction we would have a much more efficient system.

null,false,MuchWittering,null,null,null,"OK they've probably sent you a [PAYE Coding notice](https://www.gov.uk/tax-codes/what-your-paye-coding-notice-means), which advises of your tax status, or possibly a P60 (which summarises how much tax tou've paid in the previous year). Keep it somewhere safe, as it's sometimes useful if you need to prove your identity, and if you move back into work at some point

Your tax code is in two parts. The letter L means you've got the standard personal allowance of £10,000 income before you have to pay tax. The number bit is related to how much income you are allowed to earn before you go over the allowance (take the number and multiply by 10 basically, so you're allowed £5400 more untaxed income before they start taxing you. This means they've taken into account £4600 of untaxed income already as far as I can tell, based on the info [here](https://www.gov.uk/tax-codes/overview) )

If you want to reassure yourself that you don't have to fill in a tax return, there's a webform that you can work through [here](https://www.gov.uk/check-if-you-need-a-tax-return) that tells you whether you need to or not. It's pretty straightforward - I did it myself the other day, to reassure myself that I wasn't making silly assumptions about not having to do one.

I have considered starting in Blair Atholl, so the hardest parts are at the end when my bag is lightest. But I get the feeling, after 5-6 days of hiking, Cairngorm would look as appealling to walk up :)
I have done a bit of cold weather camping in Wales this year, so I am used to carrying a heavy pack for that.

I want to do some night photography aswell, so I'm using Google Earth to find picturesque locations to camp. Its hard to make a route that lets me end a day at one of these locations though...

I am going to be spending around 3 weeks in Scotland overall, I will spend few days around Fort William so I can do Ben Nevis and a few other peaks. Then the rest of my time will be spent in the Isle of Skye area. I am willing to sacrifice a few of the days on Skye to extend this trip, so I could push 9 or 10 days, which would make for an epic adventure.

null,false,OlfredTheGreat,lfcflame,,null,"00		The Reds kick off the game! WALK ON WALK ON.

02		Slightly nervy start for the West Ham defence as Adrian has to rush out to clear a loose ball. Possession is changing hands a few times already early on, here.

04		The German engineered got elbowed in the face by Hair Bun. He's all fine thought (really fine!)

07		Chance! Real opportunity for the hosts as Sterling cuts in from the right and lays off for Lallana, who is quickly closed down but it comes to Markovic, whose first shot is blocked before he slices wide.

08		Can is back in action and is immediately tested by Valencia, who brings it down on the byline and turns inside the Liverpool man, who pulls him back to concede a free kick.

09		The FK is cleared and Liverpool break through Sterling. The pass finds Lallana who fires it over

10		O'Brien goes in for a low ball with his head - a brave decision with Coutinho going in with his foot, but the West Ham gets a free kick for the high boot.

13		Chance for West Ham as Song slides the ball beyond the defence for Valencia to chase, but the forward can't get a touch and Mignolet races out to collect.

16		Cresswell is caught in possession by Lallana, who charges towards the box and fires a 20-yard shot which hits Reid. The hosts claim handball, but nothing is given.

17		Here's a chance for West Ham as Valencia races beyond the defence again, before cutting inside and drawing a foul off Lucas to win a free kick around 25 yards out.

18		Valencia's free kick is blocked but West Ham keep it going and it's floated back into the box. Liverpool get a head on it but Nolan brings it down before seeing his volley deflected behind.

19		Chance! Real end-to-end stuff at Anfield as Mignolet punches clear and Liverpool launch it forward. The ball breaks loose for Sterling, who works it into Lallana, but the midfielder's shot is straight at Adrian.

21		Liverpool push forward again and play it down the left-hand side, who looks to fire in a cross but Collins blocks to concede a corner.

22		Liverpool can't make the most of the corner but eventually force another. It breaks out to the near side and there's a feisty encounter between Downing and Markovic by the corner flag. The referee has a word to calm things down.

24		Chance! Henderson floats a lovely ball over the top for Moreno and Liverpool play some wonderful intricate stuff as Sterling backheels it into Coutinho, whose low shot is saved at the near post by Adrian.

26		Carroll charges down Skrtel's clearance on the near side, and the striker does really well to force a corner off the Liverpool defender, prompting plenty of cheers by the West Ham fans behind the goal.

27		Carroll wins the ensuing corner, but can only head it well wide of the target and Liverpool have a goal kick.
Collins looks uncomfortable. WHU could see an early sub

30		Markovic hacks it forward and Lallana does well to race on to the end of it before his cross is blocked by Reid, and the hosts have a corner.

31		Henderson fires in the set piece but Can is penalised for a shove on O'Brien. It looked like they were both guilty of pushing but the benefit of the doubt goes to the defender.

32		O'Brien swings in a cross and Markovic goes down after an aerial challenge with Carroll. Play continues and the Liverpool man is forced to get up to defend, but West Ham can't take advantage and the hosts get it clear.

34		Chance! The corner is flicked on and Carroll manages to divert a header towards the far post, but it's not got any pace on it and Mignolet saves easily.

35		Downing pushes forward down the right but is closely watched by Moreno, and the winger settles for winning a corner as his cross deflects behind. Mignolet does really well, though, to punch away his delivery.

36		Liverpool very nearly in as they charge into the West Ham half before Coutinho looks to slide a pass beyond the defence for Sterling, but Collins reads it well to cut it out.

37		Coutinho picks it up on the left and moves the ball infield. Henderson picks it up from Lucas and draws a late challenge from Song to earn a free kick around 30 yards out.

38		Henderson steps up but his shot hits Valencia in the wall and it loops behind for a corner.

39		Chance! Liverpool again sweep forward as Sterling skips past Collins before his shot defelcts off a defender. It falls for Lallana, but the midfielder can't get a meaningful effort away with the ball bouncing in the box.

40		Lallana picks the ball up beyond the defence but the flag goes up as he is just caught offside.

41		Carroll wins another header in the Liverpool half but Moreno gets to it first as Liverpool break. They can't make the most of it, though, as Coutinho can't control the ball and it runs away from him.

43		Lucas tries his luck from range, firing a low effort from 25 yards which Adrian gets down to save comfortably.

45		Henderson whips in the free kick but Collins gets up superbly to head it well clear of the area. Sterling then nearly gets in behind but Reid comes across to cover and clear.

46		Glorious opportunity for Lazar Markovic after stealing possession yards from goal but his side-foot is wide

I've also gone, or taken someone, for medical treatment at both government and private health care providers in all the countries that I've lived in.  Waiting times seems to be a government health care thing everywhere for sure.  The only time you don't have to wait for an appointment is if you live away from the big cities.  Private, seeing a doctor to get a referral to a specialist would typically be on the same day you phone for an appointment, the specialist visit can be scheduled when you can take time off work and can travel for it, extra checks like CAT scans etc. happen on the same day as seeing the specialist, and a decision for surgery can happen on that day and then be scheduled at a time that suits you, e.g. so you can recover over the holidays.  I've broken an arm Austria and had it seen to, x-rayed and put into a cast in half an hour.  The cast had to come off in Gibraltar, where the only x-ray department was at a government hospital.  They didn't have a system to make an appointment for a GP for this, so I had to wait 5 hours to see a GP that could make a referral.  I then had to wait 2 days to get the x-ray, and then another 5 days to see a specialist that would look at the x-ray to decide if my cast could come off.  It turns out my cast should have been off more than a week earlier, so I lost a week of work due to waiting times.  I can also vouch that the NHS appointment keeping is tops.  That said you're sometimes shoved out of the door before barely having a chance to speak to the doctor about all your issues, but at least someone else is not left waiting.  Cost wise, private has been a lot cheaper for me a lot of the time.  Arm breaking, covered by £70/year travel insurance.  Most years I've spent £300-£1000/month myself on National Insurance which is 'supposed' to be for the NHS, where the most I've paid for private medical insurance was £200/month for a family of three.  That's not including the cost of having lost many days of productive work due to waiting for an appointment.  It's a bit of a mixed bag, and I wish the issue wasn't so political because I think a good mix of private and public can give us the best outcome.  Uber socialist Sweden heavily and successfully outsources to private health providers.  Some people can make the choice to pay for better waiting times in order to get treatment sooner so they can get back to work and bringing in tax revenue.

null,false,buried_treasure,null,null,null,"The paramedic cars (they're not all estates, some of them are saloons) are what are termed Paramedic Rapid Response Vehicles. Basically they are sent out with a highly-qualified paramedic (actually a team of two in the LAS, they don't send their staff out solo) and their job is to either drive round or loiter parked-up close to locations where a medical emergency might occur. Frequently this means high streets on Friday/Saturday nights, but they also get sent to stay close to areas of high density population.

In contrast the ambulances themselves are all based at hospitals (I don't think there are any more non-hospital ambulance stations left in London). With the drive to close smaller hospitals the remaining extremely large ones sometimes have a pretty big catchment area, and with the congestion in London's streets it's well-nigh impossible for an ambulance to reach people at the edge of that catchment area in the government-mandated 8-minute target.

So by having RRVs stationed out and about already on the streets, generally in areas where there are likely to be 999 calls or where they know it's hard for the ambulances to get to quickly enough, they increase the chance of having trained medical personnel on scene quickly. Of course if a patient needs transporting away from the scene of the emergency then a full-sized ambulance will be radioed for, but at least while they're waiting for that to arrive the paramedics can be administering aid.

Similar systems are used [in many European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance_emergency_response_vehicle).",null,0,null,1422720210,null,0,false,0,co6t1tm,null,t3_2ub80f,null,t1_co6t1tm,null,t3_2ub80f,null,null,null,1424288610,null,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9,null

&gt;In the context of the [law of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Netherlands), the term __gedogen__ ([toleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration), although *gedogen* does not literally mean *toleration*. One can describe it best as toleration in law, but not in culture.) It refers to not enforcing certain laws. The Dutch government tolerates some offences. Some things like possessing small amounts of [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana) are formally forbidden by law, but the Dutch government abstains from bringing criminal charges against the offenders.  Often these policies are brought about by a tension between treaty obligations and domestic politics. See policies on [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands) and [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_in_the_Netherlands)  for more information.

This also occainsoally causes gout although she has been well pretty much from the start and has subsequently qualiifed as a nurse herself after  studying at university. She now works more hours than me!

 Whilst we are frequent travellers to the US and get hit hard for the travel insurance we have never had to use medical facilities there.

Many have had heart transplants due to congenital conditions and have only basic cover  and have been bankrupted or resort to begging to fund their operations and ongoing medication. They re shocked when they hear that what I'm guessing must be considered one of the most complicated and expensive medical procedures has costs us essentially nothing ever (aside from an annual prescription pre pay) and allowed her to on to be a productive member of society.

If it's installed properly it shouldn't really go wrong. I installed my dish myself, and I don't think I've touched it in 6 or 7 years.

That said, if you're being told you have to pay for a callout, playing the ""I want to cancel"" game usually changes their mind

Virgin are not saintly here. I remember when they first had the TiVo. You had to pay £200 for installation, but you couldn't keep the box or use it if you then cancel. You still had to give it back.

Many TVs do have satellite tuners, but they won't work as Freesat TVs. You can watch the free channels but the user interface is not very friendly, the channels won't be in order, you'll have about 500 copies of BBC and ITV for each region of the country, the TV might show the Sky channels that you can't watch, and there's no 7-day programme guide, only now and what's on next. It's the same as going to Maplin and buying a generic satellite receiver, and buying an actual Freesat one

Some TVs have Freesat support and will work as a Freesat box would

Sony are pretty bad at doing this. They include the satellite tuner because other countries in Europe use it and they sell the same model of TV, but don't want to put in the money/effort to make it a proper Freesat one for the UK

It's also worth pointing out that a Sky box can also show you the free channels. You can't record though, unless you pay Sky £10 a month or get a subscription.

null,false,Recursi,null,null,null,"&gt;We can say again, ""not fair, you didn't ban player x"", but the FA have shown themselves not to be fair and it won't change anytime soon. We are entering into a battle we cannot win. 

I don't think this is about trying to win a battle with the FA or with the media. As you say it is a battle that cannot be won. This particular statement is for the benefit of Chelsea supporters--a we feel the same as you--and it's not trying to rally support with rhetoric as much as it is a statement saying that we see and feel the same as you regarding this. 

&gt;Also the media have created this furor because of their relationship with Jose. Its the same everytime, media creates a storm and it makes it easier for the FA to ban or fine because of the public outcry.

I see a difference between old school media types (who let their tribalism dictate their analysis because there is only so many ways to say ""they wanted it more"" and ""grit and determination"") and the new ones (whose allegiance is to their new roles and realize that old media pundits need to be tactically astute as their new media competitors). The fact that there are at least 3 (that I am aware of) influential pundits that called for the ban to be overturned on difficulty of proving intent (or even recklessness) is hopefully a harbinger of more even-handed coverage (though I'm not holding my breath).

He's had many, many, many procedures cancelled at the last minute because of minor paperwork errors that no one bothered to tell me about until we were at the hospital for the fucking appointment. He's had equipment denied because of the same shit. Last year I spent nine months fighting just to get a simple procedure that helps him walk approved because the doctor who provides the service moved location (to the building across the street) and it meant we had to start the paperwork trail from the beginning.. and then the insurer denied it and then there was an error.. so he missed out on three of these procedures and the affect it had on his body was sad to see. While the quality of the treatment he has received has been excellent when he has received it, the NHS was far better in terms of not cocking everything up all the fucking time.

I'm still trying to get them to approve walking equipment. At this point he's using a rental and I may just try to raise funds to buy him his own outright.

Everyone gets a tax code. It's how HMRC know how much and when to tax your income. 

The number (540) is a 10 multiplier of the amount you can earn without being taxed. This means that our of your salary, £5400 won't be taxable so the government will not touch them. So if your salary for example is 20,000, you pay tax on £14,600 and the rest is tax-free.

The letter, which in this case is ""L"" just means that you're legible for tax-free income.

Most people who work full time nowadays will be on tax code 1000L, meaning they can earn 10,000 tax-free. This is different from person to person.

They get despatched depending on the nature of the emergency: There are lots of semi-emergencies where an entire ambulance is not necessary. 

Kitting an ambulance out is far more expensive, and often requires a crew of 2 to 3 people, whilst an estate car can be managed by a single paramedic and will contain all the basic utilities needed. 

This is driven by the fact that our National Health Service is under constant budget reviews and constraints. You are correct in saying that sending an ambulance out for everything is very wasteful.

The concept is common amongst most European countries that house a centralised health service as opposed to a privatised system.

Mignolet has stepped the fuck up recently and it makes me so damn happy to see it, we all gave him so much shit but he's responded to his critics so well. Coutinho was, as always, a magical unicorn. Fantastic player, hopefully with a great finisher like Sturridge back at the top, we'll see the chances he creates converted again. Beautiful finish too might I add.

Just to note, in 5 years I have personally been to see a doctor once, it took an hour for someone to pick up the phone. 
Last summer, my 4 year old banged his head at school and I was advised to call them and get him looked at because his eyes were starting to blacken, no answer after an hour and we ended up walking there only to be told they didn't have anything till wed evening (this happened on the first day back on Monday morning) and we ended up in a&amp;e.
 
The past Monday and Tuesday, I tried a total of 16 times through the days to make an appointment for having an iud removed that had slipped. No answer, it just rings off the hook, asked my neighbour if she knew a different number and I went online to make sure they didn't change the number or have a half day, when I see that they have online bookable appointments. Great, I'll do that, I clicked on 'bookable appointments' which takes me to a page that says 'to find out more about making bookable appointments, please call the surgery' I'm not even joking.
I took the iud our myself that night, with the help of some alcohol.

Kane. So lovely. Honestly, it feels like Christmas whenever the ball is at his feet. 

Eriksen was tremendous today. I think he must have covered more of the pitch than any other player. He pressed incredibly well. Made so many good passes. 

Lamela was quite good today. He made quick passes, saw open players, created chances. Was very impressed overall. Didn’t do nearly as many step-overs. He also make some key tackles.

Mason was our weakest link today, I think. He didn’t do poorly. But he gives those horrible first touches like players are raining down on him when he’s all alone. He can’t stop turning in circles and then makes only sub-par passes.

Puts it just below the Greek Superleague but higher than the Czech First League and Romanian Liga I. 

However that does put it 35% smaller than the Tippeligaen, smaller than the Austrian Bundesliga and smaller than the Danish Superliga. When you add Celtic, it overtakes all of them to 8596 leaving it just behind the Polish Ekstraklasa which has a population of 38 million.

I would argue that even without Celtic our top league does very well against the Tippeligaen, Bundesliga and Superliga.

The Scottish population has a much lower purchasing power than that of Austria, Norway and Denmark. Norway is #3, Denmark is #5 and Austria is #6. The UK does sit at 11th but Scotland would rank lower if was counted separately. Football is more affordable to the average person in those countries.

So in conclusion, we preform very well attendance wise, compared to other league when you take into account population and purchasing power.",null,0,null,1422723319,null,0,1422724838,0,co6uiid,null,t3_2uata5,null,t1_co6uiid,null,t1_co6rijr,null,null,null,1424287912,null,6,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,6,null

Joking apart, that was a proper solid game from the lads. Palace is one of the toughest places to go in the league, and we played very well. 

Whilst it wasn't coming together all too often in the final third (Naismith, McGeady and Mirallas were pretty poor throughout), our back 6 and the keeper were on another level (excpet for those early set pieces). I feel that Stones had his best game of the season, and the same has to be said for Jags. 

Baines and Coleman did their jobs, they weren't phenomenal- but aside from the odd slip or sloppy pass they were fine. Barry looked like last season Barry for most the game, and Besic once again pulled a great performance out of the bag, both in a defensive sense and by opening up play with some good direct passing. 

On the ball Besic is really beginning to remind me of Osman a few years back. He is a bit more adventurous and flashy, but the way he moves the ball around is pretty reminiscent. 

Joel once again was pretty solid. He was put under a bit of pressure with crosses and set pieces, but stood up to it and was brave when he needed to be. 

---

Whilst it isn't the win that is going to scare Liverpool, it is 3 points that we desperately needed. Whilst I will never be able to say 'bring on the derby' with much conviction (the PTSD still comes back at night), I am not absolutely dreading it (any more than usual).

Ryan might get caught out once in a while with his forward positioning, and might struggle with high shots that Mignolet would get to, but otherwise he seems like a perfect fit for a Rodgers team.

The formation change helps Mignolet because he has Skrtel ahead of him, (or should I say next to him!) to help out. Mignolet doesn't need to come of his line because Skrtel, who has a tendency to drop deep following lost of possession, helps him out. Sakho and Can are strong enough 1 v 1 on either side aswell. Mignolet - when you take the onus for building the play up, and just let him play like a traditional goalkeeper, he looks miles more comfortable. Stick a player in front of him (central defender in a back three, say) to cycle the possession instead, and let him focus on being a keeper, and all of a sudden we start keeping clean sheets more, and having better defensive performances

Ryan is a keeper who's practically the opposite of Mignolet. They both have different strengths and weaknesses and Rodgers' keeper is more of a mould of Ryan than Mignolet.

Paulinho was also fairly meek. I saw two specific instances in which he failed to be proactive and aggressive in possession: 1. Dembele holding up the ball between two defenders, Paulinho jogs nearby so Dembele decides to lay it off only to see Paulinho fail to pick up the ball so Dembele has to stretch to recover. 2. Paulinho has the ball in space in front of the WBA box, but waits for ages until dramatically falling over after a weak foul when there were two spurs to his right.

I thought Dembele played above average by his standards today. Lloris, Eriksen, and Kane remained in form.

null,false,purplepooppants,null,null,null,"The key phrase is ""in the course of your employment"".  That does *not* mean at any time from the date you take the job to the day you resign.  It means ""while you are doing your job"".

The effect of that depends on the nature of the job.  For example, if all your duties occur in a specific place (the office), then it is easy to demonstrate that any work you did elsewhere (e.g. at home) was not in the course of your duties.  The code you write in the office belongs to the company, the code you write at home belongs to you.  Things get murkier if you're working from home, or contributing to open source code at home which you also use at work -- tread carefully if you're ""crossing the streams"" like that.  It's tempting to bring code into work projects to impress people and get ahead, but by doing so you may be implicitly assigning the company copyright to the code, as further work you do on it would be ""in the course of your employment"".

People can get tripped up by this -- for example, by carrying around ""personal"" scripts/configs that they take into work and then extend.  At the point that you've hacked on something on company time, that contribution does not belong to you, it belongs to the company.  That includes if you have e.g. some open source code on github, you use it in a work project, during that project you make contributions, those contributions are *not* ""Copyright acer642 2015"", they are ""Copyright AcmeCorp 2015"".  Similarly, if on the last day of work you decide to take your carefully crafted emacs configuration file with you on a USB stick, you are actually violating the company's IP.

&gt;Around 850,000 London households are in receipt of housing benefit; higher than any other Great
Britain region. 

&gt;The mean weekly receipt of housing benefit for London households is £1342; one-third
higher than the next highest regional mean (South-east England - £98 p/w). 

[Source (PDF)](http://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/London%20Councils/WelfareReformreport.pdf)

Also:

&gt;One in four, or about 843,000, London households currently receive housing benefit to help them pay their rent, says a new London Assembly report.

&gt;The housing benefit bill for London in 2012-13 was more than £6bn and claims have risen by over 100,000 since 2008. It’s not surprising the government wants to get a hold of rising costs, but the report describes how nearly half of all households in the UK subject to the overall benefits cap have been in London.

&gt; This is primarily down to our higher housing costs. Londoners in social housing have also been disproportionately affected by the ‘bedroom tax‘.

[Source](http://londonist.com/2014/04/one-in-four-london-households-on-housing-benefit.php)

[The total cost of Housing Benefit in 2012-2013 was approx. £16.94bn.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending)

__Therefore London accounted for over 35% of the total housing benefit bill in 2012-2013.__

As you can see it is truly vast sum and a disproportionate subsidy to London employers - allowing them to pay below the true cost of living in the area - at a time when we should be encouraging business in other parts of the country.

If you haven't got the money up front you can spread the cost over 10 months.  So it should cost you less than a tenner a month, regardless of how many prescriptions you need.

Baines - Same as Coleman.

Mirallas looked dangerous but lonely, needed some more help.
Naismith was super busy, setup the goal, could have done better on a few occasions but overall a good showing.

&gt; The letter L means you've got the standard personal allowance of £10,000 income before you have to pay tax.

The number is related to how much annual income you are allowed to earn before you pay tax. So for 540L they're only allowed to earn £5400 and then will pay tax. 

I would phone them up and query it. Usually they issue lower numbers for two reasons:

I heard that Chelsea/City is being broadcast through 28 international carriers right now. 

By comparison the Super Bowl is only being carried by NBC and probably has shorter reach internationally due to broadcasters and international interest in gridiron football.

Not to mention that most people who follow both kinds of football know that the Super Bowl is usually second in numbers to the UEFA Champions League final and big games like the Manchester Derby, El Classico, and matches like this.

But yeah let's put the 'Super' Bowl in quotes because we all know it's some bush league rinky dink sporting event.

null,false,kevio17,,Eleonora Cellino really isn't all that. Discuss.,null,"GK choice is pretty much down to Alex Cairns or Eric Grimes - probably the area most of us can go 50-50- on. Cairns has a tiny bit of first team experience, and a place in the main squad. However, Grimes was recently called up to the Ireland U19 squad.

Defence is a lot more straightforward. We have two academy products starting at the moment in Sam Byram and Charlie 'Fackin' Taylor, and Ross Killock has featured in preseason for a couple of years now. Zac Thompson ^(though we signed him from Everton's youth squad) has first team experience too, as a right back and central midfielder. I'd use this combination and throw him in at centre back, though young Jake Skelton appeared last pre-season and plays in that position too.

I'm going to cheat with midfield and line up as a 4-3-3, if only because we have three incredibly promising talents in central midfield - Lewis Cook, Alex Mowatt and Chris Dawson don't need much of an introduction. We've also got Alex Purver and Kalvin Phillips who were both given a place in the first team squad earlier this season.

Up front we're not exactly drowning in young talent, so it's a bit of a pick and mix. Lewis Walters has appeared on the bench a couple of times, and Robbie McDaid, while not a strict 'academy product', came over from NI with a big reputation. This leaves one more place, who I will give to none other than Aidy White - who is somehow still a Leeds player - based on his awesome goal v Everton t'other season and his willingness to play pretty much anywhere he's put.

The difference is subtle, but important.

British-controlled territories were places that the British had conquered and claimed as part of the Empire, everywhere from Singapore to India to South Africa to Canada.

But the British never invaded or conquered Palestine. Basically at the end of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was broken up because they'd allied themselves with Germany, and of course the losers had to be punished. The League of Nations divided the former lands of the Ottoman Empire up into newly-invented countries and portioned them out among the ""Great Powers"" (which basically meant Britain and France, as Russia had now become the USSR and America wasn't at that time in the business of spreading foreign policy by means of conquest).

Wait times can be really long on a busy Saturday night in a city hospital, but generally speaking they're not at all bad. 

If you've broken an arm or a leg, expect to be seen within fifteen minutes, X-rayed within the hour and have it set and be ready to go home within 24 hours unless it's a nasty and complex break. If they think you might die, then you get seen immediately and cared for until you're stable. 

If you want to see a GP, you should be able to within 48 hours, and most appointments are same day, it's just a case of jumping through hoops to get it, like ringing at 8:30am precisely. 

If you see your GP and the GP suspects cancer, you should be starting treatment (if it is cancer) within two weeks. 

If you need a hip replaced, you could be waiting months, even over a year. Gallstones can also take months before they give you surgery. That can seem far, far too long to someone in pain.

They are very, very specific about which adverts they run and when and how much they charge for each 10 seconds of advertising time. They know for example, that at 7pm, it's time to advertise their mass appeal things and then during midnight/early hours they charge almost nothing for advertising space those same companies or a fortune for companies offering insomniac related, quirky sleep aides. The most alarming thing I found, sort of as you suggested was basically basing their entire strategy on the fact that their demographic was part of a group which opted in to the channel. It wasn't on any Sky default package, so the people who wanted the channel specifically had to ask for it which narrows down their socio-economic targets in terms of people to an almost certainty. For adverts that specifically targeted these individuals with higher disposable income and particular interests they charged an almost criminal rate for advertising. The even scarier part was, it worked.

It was actually disturbing for the first few days to see how pathological these people truly were. They had experts in impulsive purchasing but also experts in things like subliminal messaging, colour coordination and language and a bunch of the people in the office had PhD level education in advanced human psychology.

Companies which sold more products/services following heavy advertising were charged more accordingly for subsequent advertising space as part of a symbiotic relationship. It's insane the amount of work that went into it. I always knew these people were pretty advanced with what they did but I kid you not when I say that there were about 30 people working in an office dedicated to advertising across 6 channels. The mind boggles.

Sturridge is a better striker, yes, but he's comfortable with the role that we use him in -- he likes being the main man up top, has links with our midfield (Coutinho especially) and has played for us enough that he knows the system inside out. Balo doesn't have that luxury at the moment. 

I'm hoping that, with Studge back, Balo gets a chance to play up with him and they create a great partnership; Sturridge was even better last season when paired with Suarez, maybe that could happen once more.

Count the number of people who have been killed or injured by terrorism.  Assign some numerical quantity for that harm on the same scale as you used for the previous assignment.

Multiply the harm by the count in each case.  If you pick any reasonable scale for harm, the massive, massive count of the number of people harmed by invasion of privacy will _always_ outweigh the harm done by terrorism.  There is absolutely no reasonable argument for damaging an entire population for the sake of catching a relatively small number of terrorists.

Bear in mind that more people are killed each year by vending machines falling on them than by terrorism.  More are killed by their own toddlers than by terrorists (admittedly [that's in the US](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/youre-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-toddler-than-a-terrorist.html), I can't find figures for the UK, but I can't imagine percentages are much different).

Neither the Lib Dems nor Labour could afford another general election. They were both completely bankrupt by May- whereas the Tories had enough to hand to fight another without much difficulty. 

&gt;and if that had happened Clegg would be riding high in the polls right now instead of being a despised non-entity.

null,false,Rimbaudelaire,flair5,,null,"Blimey.  Well we won the FA Cup (the last time we did) in 1991.  I was 11! But already a staunch fan, something considering I come from a family entirely disinterested by sports, except my dad and formula one.

That was some team.  Gascoigne and Lineker are largely why I am a spurs fan, I was originally closer to Portsmouth run North London (moved up in 1998), but that team also had the original great scandi Premiership keepee, Thorsvedt as well as club legend Gary Mabbut and Nayim etc.

See Gascoigne's semi final goal against the scum for the clincher of me being a fan - schoolboy stuff!  Commentator probably meant stuff of schoolboy dreams, but it's iconic commentary regardless.  The goal, a masterful free kick , is worth looking up. 

The final against Forest I can remember to this day.  Some of my favourite non spurs players, like Pearce and surreally Ian Woan played for them, and I was sure Pearce would see forest win.  Classic spurs mentality.  Not comfortable unless 5-0 up, and even then ...

But my highlight times were a little later.  Klinnsman!  My cat is called Jürgen.  Teddy Sheringham (the cleverest strike partner I had, said Klinnsman).  Nicky Barmby!  Help, I even loved David Howells and Steffan Iverson.  When I was in uni in the east end, i ran into Teddy Sheringham, Steffan Iverson and a couple I can no longer remember, in Kebabland, South Woodford, after a game we had lost.  It was about 1am.  Very funny.

Probably doesn't happen now.  

In terms of league positions and points we were pretty poor.  Mostly finished midtable, 7th was considered the norm.  One year David Ginola pretty much kept us up singlehandedly, which is why he can do no wrong.  We've had it good recently by comparison.

When we won the League Cup in 1999 (just like we WILL this year), i was in uni halls.  Alan Nielsen!  Weirdly, we were mess successful but I miss those teams.

My favourite Spur of the 90s?  Darren Anderton by far.  See the 6-2 (6-3?) Cup win against Southampton, I was there.  Glorious.

Sky doesn't own the satellites and they don't own most of the transmission infrastructure for satellite TV. They own a programme guide and they hand out free boxes/dishes that work with that programme guide and can decrypt the stuff Sky wants you to pay for. Some of their customers haven't even had these for free, as they may have paid for a professional dish installation from a third party and paid full price for a box

Most channels pay for their own satellite space and transmission, and simply pay Sky for a position in Sky's programme guide. Sky buy their own satellite space and run their own transmission facilities for their own channels and select third parties, but for something like the BBC they more or less handle it all themselves and just pay for the ability to appear on Sky. Many free channels also pay Freesat to appear on their guide.

- 1 -1 is alright considering everything. I feel like City had a lot more possession in the second half and without Costa and Cesc we managed to do alright.

- Zouma is really showing A LOT of potential!

We called reception for medical assistance - they sent up a couple of lawyers to get us to sign a waiver to say it wasn't the hotel's fault before they called an ambulance.  :-( 

My wife spent nearly four hours in the ER with him before he was seen (had to hand over a credit card first of course, even though we had insurance). Treatment consisted of just a sling and a few painkillers, both of which we could have done ourselves.  The bill for a few thousand $ was covered by insurance, but we were still being chased up for the ambulance costs months later.

The treatment he would have got at home would probably  have been identical, but he would have been seen quicker and we wouldn't have had to deal with all the extra stress of paying for it.

null,false,askoorb,null,null,null,"Hi there,

As someone who currently works in the NHS, I will try and help you out with this one.  I’ve also had relatives and friends move countries and have helped them with practical aspects like this – feel free to drop me a PM if you need any other help.

First, I'm going to guess that you are from the USA, as you are talking about the “ER” and “specialist”.

A bit of background, the NHS works a bit like an HMO does in the US, you have a GP (PCP) who is a ""specialised generalist"", they can diagnose and manage a number of conditions directly, and can pass you up to a Consultant (specialist) or other team where appropriate.  It is fairly rare for you to access a consultant directly without seeing your GP first and you choosing where you want to be seen.

In this instance, I understand you went to your nearest A&amp;E department for what you believed was an immediately life or limb threatening condition, or there was significant blood loss or loss of consciousness.  It sounds like the A&amp;E doctors decided that it wasn’t immediately life threatening, but could be managed by a routine review in 3 months’ time.  If in the future you feel you may need treatment urgently, but are not sure if it is an emergency, you may get help faster in a more appropriate place by ringing [NHS 111](http://www.nhs.uk/111) free of charge 24 hours a day (give them a ring now to check out what they do – they will be happy to tell you).

The NHS works on a medical priority basis, so for urgent conditions you can be seen very quickly indeed, whilst for totally routine matters you may have a wait a few weeks behind the urgent cases.

As other people have said, you need to go and see you GP and ask them to give you more information on the condition, and if you both agree it is warranted, ask you GP to send an “expedite” request for this referral – this will jump you up to the “urgent” priority.

GPs should know how to manage kidney and other renal problems very well, so don't worry about doing this.

If you haven’t registered with the NHS yet (by registering with a GP) you can find one at by entering your postcode into the search on [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4).  Ignore the market saying whether the GP is accepting new patients and ring to ask – it quite often is out of date.  For urgent matters, a GP is available 24 hours a day.

If you don’t care which GP you get, ring your Area Team and ask them to allocate you to a GP.  You can find your Area Team on [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Area-Team/LocationSearch/1839).  Your Area Team should also be able to find you an NHS dentist if you ask them.

If you are interested, you can also find out how the NHS would normally treat your condition by searching for it on [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions).  It should be an interesting read.

In the NHS, you can choose which hospital you go to for treatment (and if you want, which doctor) from technically any hospital in England or the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.  You can find out about performance and waiting times in hospitals in England on [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/service-search), and about being treated Europe elsewhere on [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheNHS/Yourchoices/Pages/your-choices.aspx).

I hope that helps you get the treatment you choose.

A word of warning though, private healthcare in the UK is very different to the US.  Most private hospitals are not well equipped, and the doctors are simply local NHS doctors spending one afternoon a week running a clinic there.  For example, my nearest private hospital doesn’t have an A&amp;E, doesn’t have a pathology lab, doesn’t have any imaging availability apart from simply X-Rays (no CT or MRI on site for example) doesn’t hold blood stocks on site (so blood for major bleeds during surgery would have to be sourced from the local NHS hospital), and in some cases (for example with eye surgery) actually has to subcontract the surgery back to the local NHS hospital (they don’t have an eye theatre).  Make sure that the private hospital you choose is actually as good as the best NHS hospital you can get to.

If you are interested in some of the guarantees you get the NHS (like maximum waiting times) you can learn more at [NHS Choices.](http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheNHS/Rightsandpledges/) 

If you have any problems accessing the service you choose, or need any other guidance, please drop me a PM and I will be happy to help.

I hope all that helps.

The central issue in the case was whether or not the harm was reasonable foreseeable. The claimant's husband had an egg allergy and he died from eating the caterer's food at a wedding. It was a Sikh wedding, Sikhs are prohibited from eating eggs. The caterer knew this, however when the food ran out he sourced more from another supplier. The dish provided would not normally contain eggs but for reasons unknown the supplier had used eggs in the dish. Under the unusual circumstances, the caterer did create a duty of care as the caterer was not to serve eggs. It was reasonable foreseeable that some guests are allergic to eggs and that anyone attending the wedding would expect the food to be free from eggs.

The Liberal Democrats have just 1/5th of the seats in government that the Conservatives do. They are a minority by a significant margin and as a result when it comes to significant areas such as fiscal policy (AKA government spending) this is an area where they do not have enough clout. 

The tuition fees are a significant amount of money and it would simply be impossible for the Lib Dems to remove tuition fees or block the conservatives from increasing them (because the conservatives would have to re-write a significant portion of their budget to pay for it and they would be obviously unwilling to do so) so long as they are such weak members of the coalition. 

They actually did quite well in altering the Conservative's plans to introduce unlimited tuition fees, they were capped at £9k a year, nothing has to be paid if you are earning less than £21k etc; in some ways it is actually a better deal for some students, particularly ones with low incomes straight out of university.

If the Lib Dems did what some people are suggesting and didn't go into coalition with the Conservatives it is quite possible that the Conservatives would have introduced unlimited tuition fees (assuming that the Conservatives managed to form a government)

It should be the task of the Lords during occasions like these to ensure the policy is given thorough rigorous analysis by people who are more aware of the nuances and wider implications of the decision.

Less channels, so assuming you wanted to keep the free Sat channels...
 
You'd have to buy another Sat PVR box, and use whatever EPG the new box came with. 

If an equivalent box is [£130](http://www.ebuyer.com/655040-manhattan-plaza-hdr-s-500gb-freesat-hd-recorder-hdr-s), you wouldn't break even until a year later.

(Also, I don't know if it's still the case, but there was a difference between the channels you could get with an active viewing card and without.)

Edit: *Sat PVR

Edit 2: 

What I was trying to say: Some channels used to be FTV (free to view) which were free but encrypted so needed an active viewing card. Freesat (as opposed to [*Freesat from Sky*](http://www.sky.com/shop/freesat/home/), which is a different thing) can only view FTA (free to air) which are unencrypted.

I suspect that the Lib Dems will follow the Lab/Con lead but that said I wouldn't be surprised by them declaring they support legalisation as a campaigning issue to grab votes and to differentiate themselves from the Tories.

Campaigning aside the evidence coming out of the U.S. has undoubtedly been noticed. I think we'll see legalisation within the next 10 years (that is providing none of the three parties are forced to come out against it in a campaigning setting. They don't want to be seen as flip flopping), it'll be an out of the blue thing like how Gay Marriage was put forward.

------
For those who want to campaign now we have the legalised models in the US the debate should be framed around the drop in crime and the raise in tax revenue.

People don't like to be seen to back track and admit they're wrong. I suspect that a lot of those who are opposed openly are trying to protect their image of being tough on crime and protecting children. Reach out and argue for legalisation on the terms they like, don't say ""you're wrong"" say ""with the little information we had back then I would have supported criminalisation also, but with this new information it's time to reassess. I share your concerns but as we've seen in X, Y, Z they may be unfounded, what do you think?""

Furthermore, the specific clinic (Waterloo Heath Centre) - is great at making appointments as they now have a call back feature. 

The call back feature is that you can have a doctor call you within 90 minutes, you explain the situation to him/her and they will decide if you need to come in.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"&gt; Many motoring offences are strict liability and require no intent.

Examples are speeding offences. If the speed can be proved, and it can be proved that you were driving, and you do not have an emergency services exemption, then the only possible verdict is guilty.

Many other offences are strict liability - e.g. driving without insurance (it only has to be proved that there was no insurance, that the vehicle was in a public place and that you were in charge of it - no other evidence is required, and there is only one defence which is that it is your employer's vehicle and you were driving it as part of your employment), causing death by unlawful driving (if the driving was unlawful, e.g. no licence, and it results in a death, then there is no defence).

It is technically the case that dangerous driving is not strict liability. While it does not require intent, it requires negligence. Hence, to get a conviction for dangerous driving, negligence (in the form of poor driving or decisions relating to it) has to be proven.  More importantly, dangerous driving requires a sustained period of negligence - i.e. there has to be more than just evidence of momentary bad driving, e.g. someone who drives while tired, or has been seen to be speeding severely on multiple occasions (there was a recent case where someone was prosecuted for careless driving, but during the investigation, the police accessed an insurance black box which showed that he was a ""serial speeder"" - he was convicted of careless driving because of the accident, and also of dangerous driving because of the black box data)

There are less serious offences such as DWDCA, where only a momentary lapse of concentration needs to be proven - e.g. where a collision occurs at a junction, because a driver was mistakenly distracted for 2 seconds.",null,0,null,1422738125,null,0,false,0,co724g5,null,t3_2uarej,null,t1_co724g5,null,t1_co6xkrs,null,null,null,1424284317,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,null,"How to work towards solving the wider ""London problem"" in a few relatively easy steps:

* Parliament need to ban ""London weighting"".  It should be illegal to pay a London-based person more money for the same job - get that artificial extra money out of the local economy and watch the price of everything be forced into correction

* Give companies incentives and tax breaks if they move their operations out of London

* Set an example by decentralising Westminster - move government departments around to ""the provinces""

* London rents (ideally including private) should be capped and there needs to be tighter controls on who owns property

The bottom line is that the government has, over many years, deliberately fostered policies which promote and benefit London no matter what the cost to anywhere else.  This means more people come to London for work or leisure, more people need accommodation, hence landlords can charge whatever they like and people will gladly pay.

House sharing with three other people should be a lifestyle choice and a bit of fun for young people, not a fact of life or necessity for survival amongst people in their middle age.

null,false,sgtstock,null,null,null,"I may be able to help with this, as I did my undergraduate at University of Liverpool, where I met my girlfriend who did her masters at Royal Holloway last year, and I lived at home about 40 mins drive away.

Before I answer your questions, I will just mention that you would be wrong to think that Holloway is close to London.  Its a good 40 mins by train, and will cost upwards of £15 for a return.

With regard to the course, perhaps looking at the Times online guide will give you an idea of the rankings for each university in that subject, and that may influence your decision.

On to your questions:
1) Liverpool Uni is fantastic, and in my opinion far better than holloway.  This is not just because of the excellent facilities etc that were available, but because the city is amazing, and that really is important.  Whilst you are at university foremost to get a good degree, you will struggle if you cant have fun during your downtime. Egham (holloway) has very little to offer, whilst Liverpool has the benefit of being a bigger uni, and a bigger city.

2) Life is good in both places.  Never felt unsafe in either Liverpool or Egham, and the housing quality outside of halls is fairly equal. Infinitely better nightlife and social life in Liverpool though.

3) Liverpool is far cheaper than holloway.  Drinks, food, accomodation all cheaper, and the added cost of transport in Liverpool for the bus is quickly cancelled out elsewhere

4) Transport to the airport is easy, its about a 30-40 min bus ride from the main student area (Smithdown Road). Egham to Heathrow takes around 1hr to T5, and longer to any other terminal from there

5) Negative is that you do have to be more careful in some situations.  I had my bike stolen 3 times in 3 years, but that way mainly from me being lazy with my bike lock.

6) I cant think ofg anything specific right now, but feel free to ask and I will try to answer as best as possible.

Tl;dr: 1) LIverpool good, Holloway bad, 2) Great, 3) Cheap, 4) Good, 5) Theft",null,0,null,1422738210,null,0,false,0,co725zu,null,t3_2uc4lp,null,t1_co725zu,null,t3_2uc4lp,null,null,null,1424284296,null,2,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,2,null

It's bounced all over the Unite facebook pages last couple of days, and Unite's Executive Council even repeated their commitment against fracking in the council meeting earlier this week.

null,false,B23vital,null,null,null,"Although i agree with you, i also have to disagree.
My area of birmingham has boomed for housing prices, one house opposite my parents has rose by £45k in only 2 years. These houses are affordable for my parents ( when they bought it) yet expensive for me. Now this would sound fine, except me and my dad both work for the same company on the same wage, while my SO earns more than my mom. 
The whole, 'lottery at birth' comment is a joke, it shouldn't be acceptable to say that. I wasnt born into a lottery and neither were my parents, but yet they can afford something i cant even after earning the same wage as them.
The issue is that house prices are booming and constantly rising well above wage increases. Mainly die to these so called 'lottery at birth' children buying houses to rent out. With a population on the rise, and a housing market flattening out (in terms of new builds) you can only expect the house and rent prices to inflate well above affordable pricing. 
Renting accommodation is also a major problem in this country (with around 1/3 homes being private landlords) this freezes up the market for potential buyers and creates an over inflated market in terms of pricing. It would be interesting to see the percentage of privately rented accommodation now compared to 10-30 odd years ago. 


Edit:
Using an inflation calculator, my parents house bought in 1995 for £28k, would be £48,610 in todays money. Yet the house is worth well over £120k in todays market. This shows the sheer inflation in housing pricing compared to inflation of money. 
Of course this doesn't take into account wage increases (which i assume would not be high) it proves the point that housing is over inflated and the cost is much higher compared to only 20years ago.

The party with the most MPs usually forms a government. The leader of that party becomes the Prime Minister. He doesn't have much executive power (that is ceremonially held by the Queen) but he is the public face and leader of the government. 

The upper house, the House of Lords, is a chamber made up of non-elected peers. In the past they were members of nobility with the seat in the chamber passed down from father to son. Nowadays, most seats are taken by people who hold it for their lifetimes and it doesn't pass on. Those chosen to sit their are nominated by the political parties and are usually prominent members of society (such as former Prime Ministers, MPs, business people) as well as some members of the clergy not chosen by the political parties. The house of Lords is designated to ratify bills put forward by the Commons. 

A bill is put forward in the Commons and voted on, if it passes it goes to the House of Lords to be ratified. If it passes there then it is signed off by the monarch to become law.

&gt;No one would complain were the retrospective disciplinary panel to view all incidents equitably rather than in the current arbitrary and opaque fashion. Otherwise the risk is that the perceived seriousness of an offence appears influenced by the level and vehemence of its media coverage. 

&gt;Refereeing is certain to be under scrutiny again this weekend, especially as there were several other controversial issues during our beating of Liverpool. Michael Oliver appeared to miss a penalty offence by Martin Skrtel on Diego Costa (as well as a retaliatory kick-out later by the Slovakian) and several off-the-ball strongarms by Lazar Markovic on Filipe Luis.

&gt;Lucas Leiva also somehow escaped a caution for his deliberate tripping of Eden Hazard, surging towards the box at the time, which would have been the Reds midfielder’s second yellow of the match. The fact it led to Willian’s excellent cross for Branislav Ivanovic’s towering header overshadowed Leiva’s continued presence on the field.
Least fathomably, the referee awarded a foul for deliberate handball by Jordan Henderson, but failed to show the expected yellow card, which would have been the Liverpool midfielder’s marching orders.

&gt;Retired man-in-black Graham Poll reportedly considered that decision ‘the most simple, straightforward second yellow card you will ever see. It was verging on impartial [sic)].’ 

&gt;Happily, despite all that, Chelsea qualified for the Capital One Cup final on 1 March at Wembley by being a better team than Liverpool on the night.

He knows he can't just pump in a cross for a header - because it will be cleared 100% of the time when its Aguero vs. a Terry, or a Jovetic, or a non-striker like Silva or Milner in the middle.

Given that factor, he is handcuffed.   Once Bony is here and Dzeko is back to fitness you will start to see him do what he did last year.

In the 1st half we let Chelsea rest the ball for too long and allowed them too much space in the midfield, this is where their goal came from too. In the 2nd half we actually began pressing them hard, which really paid off as they never got to comfortably rest the ball which lead to many failed passes on their front. Pressing their defense is also crucial, they're a slow bunch who love to stall with slow passing between each other, so it made them uncomfortable enough to not dare executing their little strategy.

Another thing is that we mainly played in the left side of the pitch in the 1st half, and it never amounted to anything. The one time we decided to play up the right side we actually got a goal. In the 2nd half we were constantly pressing them on the right side, which left us with much more room as Azpilicueta isn't as solid a defender as Ivanovic.

While we didn't score in the 2nd half, we were still doing the right thing, not allowing Chelsea to even be slightly dangerous while constantly pressuring them.

* Zouma had a great game but he needs more experience as he did not look comfortable on the ball and playing it from defense. He looked unnatural on the ball and rushed his passes. He also made some necessary clearances. But that will stop with experience and training. He was great in tackling, positioning etc. He looked very natural and was very solid.

* I'll take a solid draw however Man City were the better team. They had more connections and links and used the width of the pitch well. We needed Fabregas to link our play up.

* I thought Remy was fine, Drogba didn't really have the time to show his full form that day with only around 10 minutes to play at the end. Remy's goal was all down to his positing and his run which I thought was good and then it was an easy goal. I think he should have tried to get in behind the defense more with his pace and drag the slow Kompany and Demichelis around and perhaps open some space for Hazard or Oscar or Willian to run into however Ramires and Matic did not have the vision or attacking mind to see any of the rare occasions where that happened.

He's not been as bad as was last season because he's had better players around him but he's better when he's not the attacking edge of our midfield.

In a perfect world, Sam would have kept with keeping Nolan as an impact sub like Cole is, but injuries/AFCON and I think a lack of faith in younger players (Poyet) has caused him to fall back on Nolan.",null,0,null,1422743467,null,0,false,0,co74snx,null,t3_2uc9hg,null,t1_co74snx,null,t3_2uc9hg,null,null,null,1424283069,null,6,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,6,null

Oh, and Napoleon didn't make everyone equal before the law, he made everyone equal before himself. Hardly a noble goal compared to your phrasing. Wellington, by coincidence, became Prime Minister without needing a revolution and one of his earliest acts was the emancipation of Catholics. Something that's pretty significant since the Catholic/Protestant spat in the UK started with Queen Elizabeth the first and only ended officially with Tony Blair in the nineties.

Oh, and.

&gt;I am not ignorant of Wellington's political career, I just consider it insignificant compared to Napoleon's.

Of course you do. You'd rather glorify a man who took the easy road to the highest office by any means necessary and subduing anyone and everyone he could in the process than a man who, for all his flaws, lived for the country he served and served his country for as long as he lived.

Oh, and Napoleon's parents spoke French, this is not mutually exclusive from speaking Italian. They also spoke Spanish but that doesn't make Napoleon any less French, and even if he wasn't French by strict geneology or ancestry he clearly considered himself as such since he once dismissed a the word ""impossible"" as ""Not French"" in a letter to General Jean Le Marois.

Once again, even if he wasn't strictly French at birth, he was as French as you could get by the time he decided to do us all a favour and die.

Putting it in a bag isn't enough. Wrap it in a plastic bag, then tape this up, *then* put it in something like a sports bag or guitar case. 

Don't draw any attention to it whatsoever, and if you do happen to get stopped by a copper, ask to see their warrant card and if it appears genuine (someone just dressed as a copper or claiming to be plain clothes police *probably* wouldn't have one) *then* say to them immediately that the bag you are carrying contains a well-secured sword that you consider yourself to have a good reason for having with you.

Hmm. The HD boxes are linux based so they had to release some of the source under GPL. Its [certainly possible to get a copy of the firmware](http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1650462) &amp; whilst a JTAG interface isn't fitted I know people have managed to fit them. So it would certainly be possible to reverse engineer &amp; modify the proprietary code.

&gt; I think two years is a fairly long time at the moment. Look where Netflix was two years ago...

Exactly. All that has happened is the reasons to use Sky have decreased. People are getting more content in more ways. Free television has also hugely expanded.

&gt; and to use it on a Sat platform, requires a Sky viewing card iirc

Then keep the old sky box about for it if your internet connection isn't good enough to stream! It also means you've got a free non-recording freesat box for another TV.

&gt; Is there an up-to-date list somewhere? I couldn't find it, but my Google-fu is weak today.

Sky ""freesat"" list the channels they offer. Freesat do the same. I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to parse the two into lists and run a diff on them. Would offer, but i'm tired and lazy!

&gt; I don't think so.

To be honest I have no idea what the card slot in the box is for. Probably non-UK markets. I just assumed it would be NDS like Sky.

&gt; I think that the cards are tied to boxes nowadays. For HD, anyway.

Unless their is specialist hardware with a private key between the card interface &amp; port on the machine then this will just come down to the box reporting its serial number etc to the card. Which if you can modify the firmware (I'm sure people have released open source firmware for common boxes) is trivial to fake. I know recently sky moved to encrypting communication between the box &amp; card - defeating that only involved having to lift the private key out of a boxes firmware.",null,0,null,1422747031,null,0,false,0,co76ks4,null,t3_2ub1nd,null,t1_co76ks4,null,t1_co74m5b,null,null,null,1424282217,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

With regards to the points you raise; obviously giving the police another standard issue weapon would undoubtably help in the scenarios you outline. It is however a prohibited firearm when it comes to ownership by the public. In the face of falling crime, falling gun crime and falling violent crime why should we now start arming all police with tazers? As you and Red1123 have said, and I believe as well, it is a clear step towards arming all police with conventional firearms. It seems to be a definite sea change in the nature of policing in the UK, but why is it necessary? 

If we are trying to protect ourselves from terror attacks as seen in Paris etc surely we should be funding something which can combat attacks of that type rather than something which is not able to counter those sorts of attacks, and is most useful for dealing with people who are themselves not armed with firearms.

Tazers are a tool which would have much utility for day to day policing and little for terror attacks; to point at terrorism while pushing a weapon which will only be used on the general populace seems quite disingenuous",null,0,null,1422747811,null,0,false,0,co76ywx,null,t3_2ua6am,null,t1_co76ywx,null,t1_co765do,null,null,null,1424282034,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

No, he is correct. Much of the greenbelt has low or negative environmental value. This is because much of the greenbelt used for high intensity farming. Arguably even suburban gardens contribute much more biodiversity.

&gt;It has enormous psychological value just by it's very existence, and it enriches the lives of the people who visit it.

Some parts of the greenbelt have high amenity, such as the beautiful bits of rolling Hertfordshire, the Chilterns or the North Downs. Or rather, the beautiful bits to which there is public access. Such areas really need to be preserved against development. But almost all greenbelt land is privately owned, so the only access is if there are viable public rights of way.

The psychological value associated with more affordable housing should also be considered IMO.
