With the team we have, I'd be *utterly* disappointed in our lack of performance in this second half of the season if 'Frank Lampard', is indeed the the title decider, which I highly doubt will be the case.

This is why Hicks &amp; Gillet's ownership was so harmful. We still aren't clear of the fallout from that atomic shit bomb.

It's a feather in Rodger's cap that we managed to challenge last year, because We're missing a full generation of players in our squad. 

EDIT: Also, under FSG, we are now buying players who will prevent this happening again. Yes, we're all sick of hearing about ""potential"" all the time, but it's absolutely vital for the clubs long term future. If we throw all our money on 27 year olds and don't invest in youth then we will a) buy less players, and b) never get over the problem we have right now.

It sucks, but we have to stay on the path we are now. Potential is the best market. All of Rafa's best signings were bought for their potential. 

We do, however, have to ensure that the talent stays with us. The only way we can do that is success and money. Fortunately we already have a good financial foundation and success will propel us to the very highest earners pretty quickly. 

But the success must come or the talent will leave and we become the new Arsenal.

""You do not have the right to say Islam is bad"" (from the clip).
 Yes, we go have that right, because the laws we believe in permit it. However he views Islamic law above UK law, so believes we can't.

Same with the cartoons. Muslims believe Muhammad as above anything else. The absolute voice that can't be questioned and think that the cartoons are attacks on him. We just see him as another God.

Furthermore, to a Muslim a cartoon of Muhammad or a criticism of Islamic values is a deep insult, whereas to an atheist or agnostic or whatever it is just a criticism of a belief. This is another big problem because any criticism of Islam is claimed as an insult and now the law gets tricky because ""we don't want to offend"".

The problem is most moderate Muslims get on with society fine and are not violent, but still hold Islam above the law which is why they believe it can't be criticised and imo this is a much bigger issue than the odd violent extremist.

As a society we really need to start discussing this because it's only going to get worse. I don't know what the solution is but I am really tired of religion being above criticism. It's holding back society and imo humanity as a whole. I think even moderate Islamic views are just incompatible with western society. Until Muslims put their religion below their nationality, society and human law, we will have problems.

Let's flesh that out a bit then along with some back of envelope calculations. The current NHS budget is around 110 billion. 

Tridents acquisition cost was &gt;10 billion with 2.5 billion yearly costs. I'm not against a nuclear deterrent per-se but the trouble with Trident is that it's a gold plated second strike weapon optimised for the bad old days of the Cold War. It's total overkill for today's world, with a far weaker Russia. We could maintain a deterrent far more cheaply (we used to in fact). It would even be one we could use without asking the US for permission first: at the moment we are laying over the odds to be an adjunct to their forces. 

The UK spent 8.4 billion on operations in Iraq (aside from the human cost of course) for what was purely a vanity project for US neocons and Tony. It's not a case of 20-20 hindsight: a hell of a lot of people said it was a bad idea beforehand. Big surpluses, they were right: no WMDs and no link to AQ ... well, not before we trashed the place. *Now* there is.

Afghanistan was a different case I will grant, though I will point out we spent 37 billion there in large part to cover the US while it went off to play in Iraq.

Conservative estimates of unpaid corporate tax start at around 4 billion a year. Some estimates are much higher but let's take the low one for the sake of argument. That's not gouging business for more - just insisting they pay what they should be paying.

As for the Lords champagne budget, well yes I did just throw that in to make a point, it's a mere quarter million pounds a year. Practically chump change in this context but they rather annoyed a lot of people by complaint about the vintage ... in a time when the workfare budget for millions was being cut.

So the UK clearly had north of 50 billion available to piss against the wall just from the items I've listed above. Low balling the yearly figure there's around 7 billion a year that could be going to the NHS. If we wanted it to.

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"Everyone that the Doctor has met in NuWho who has been aware of the Time Lords, has been aware of them only as myths or as existing in the past (no matter at what point in time the Doctor has met them).  

Conversely, everyone that the Doctor met in Classic who who was aware of the Time Lords, new them as existing currently (again, no matter when it time he met them).  

Everyone, that is, with a couple of exceptions, that I'll come to in a minute.  

From this evidence, it seems to me that the Doctor is living and travelling in a ""post time war"" version of the universe. Even if he travelled back to a few seconds after the big bang - or however close to that he can actually get - then it would still be in a post time war universe (and he would still only be able to meet people who new of the Time Lords as existing in the past, somehow).  

There are a couple of exceptions, as I said. One is Sarah Jane Smith: well she travelled with him pre-war, so is always going to be an exception. She is effectively part of his timeline, and no paradoxes have resulted in her finding out later in her life that a war had happened.  

The other exception is the Doctor himself. Specifically, the Fifth Doctor when he met the Tenth in the Children in Need special *Timecrash*. Now, in Classic Who, the Doctor met his former selves on several occasions, and he has also met his former selves in NuWho. On each of those occasions, due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, his earlier selves forgot the meeting once they returned to their own timestreams, leaving only the older ""current"" version able to recall what had happened. *Timecrash* was unique in that Ten knew how to solve the problem because he could remember what he did from when he was Five. i.e. his younger self had remembered this event. I think that this indicates that this event was a Fixed Point in Time: he could remember it happening, therefore it had to happen. As a result, this kind of exception does not violate the general ""post war version"" hypothesis.  

There is some similarity between *Timecrash* and the barn scene in *Listen*, when not the Doctor himself, but Clara form the Doctor's future meets a past Doctor. She passes him a vital idea that he would clearly go on to remember and would affect his outlook. As a result, this too seems like a Fixed Point in Time, so also had to happen.  

Since we are on the subject of that scene, the other point to consider is that throughout Classic who, and with the exception of the multi-Doctor meetings, the TARDIS would keep time with Gallifrey and with the timelines of other Time Lords: if ten years passed in the TARDIS, then ten would pass for the Master or on Gallifrey etc. This, it seems, was an effect of the Eye of Harmony, and prevented paradoxes occurring within the Gallifreyan timeline.  

With Gallifrey (and the original Eye of Harmony) gone now, there is no ""Gallifreyan Mean Time"" to synchronise with, which allowed the TARDIS to go back into the past of his timeline here, and possibly also in *Timecrash*.  

The other reason that it seems that it is a new version of the universe in NuWho, is that if we suppose that it was possible for the Doctor to meet pre time war Time Lords, then it must be possible for pre time war Time Lords to meet the Doctor - or the Master. And if so, would it not be possible for post time war Daleks (also capable of time travel, and with an eye of harmony of their own) to meet pre time war Daleks? Think of the opportunities for the exchange of strategic information that that would give them. Think of the opportunities for power that the Master would have if he could meet former version of himself - either power due to knowledge of future events in his own timeline, or due to being able to operate in a universe free from other interfering Time Lords (except the Doctor, of course). And in both cases, we have seen them - the Daleks and the Master being willing to endanger the existence of the universe to win power, so there is no question of them being unwilling to do this because of ""safeguards"" or paradoxes etc. It really does suggest to me that there is a solid, unbreakable law of physics preventing meetings of pre- and post- war versions of the universe like this, except in the most unusual of circumstances.

Still buy them as early as possible though because the cheapest ones go first. I liked the boot room hospitality better than the main stand ones though the centenary stand hospitality I got from my employers lawyers was awesome.

It's pretty cunty to take over £100,000 (edit: apparently more like £500,000+) worth of education, training and the time of actual NHS doctors (who extensively train medical students) and then leave.

The whole application process, interview process, training scheme and everything else is all geared at putting doctors into the NHS. If it's so terrible in the UK, why did they go through all of that?

Edit, for clarification. I'm not talking about any retroactive ""punishment"". I'm talking about making prospective MBBS students sign a deal with the government, agreeing that they will work in the UK NHS for X amount of years before leaving, otherwise they would be required to pay back costs associated with the training.

It's all very well to say ""it's my life"", but when people have invested half a million pounds in you, I would say that makes you somewhat indebted. It's also no secret that MBBS training and all subsequent training is designed to create more doctors for the NHS. From the very first year of training, trainees spend time learning from NHS doctors and seeing NHS patients.

This is also not a crazy concept. Many countries run similar programs where they pay talented students to attend the best universities with the proviso that they return to their originating country and work for a certain amount of time.

Finally, this would not affect foreign doctors working here. They are totally welcome here. Whatever deals they made with their home countries is entirely up to them. If their countries are happy to train them and let them leave, that's up to them.

But if they're doing that on the back of £100k+ of loans from British taxpayers and an extensive investment from the British NHS, that is wrong. If they want to work abroad, they can pay for their training, or simply train abroad too following whatever rules of that other country.

Since medicine places are ALWAYS oversubscribed and extremely competitive, if these terms were made clear before signing up, there would still be absolutely no problem training the full number of doctors.

The NHS is not a charity and university education is not charity either. It is an investment by the people of the UK. We pay a lot of tax, supporting the idea that sharing the cost of the service is good for everybody. As I said, all medical training in the UK is heavily centred around going to work within the NHS. From the first year of training, medical students interact with NHS patients and are trained by NHS doctors. That is time and resources which we are paying for, which should be towards the benefit of the country. It is not supposed to be a charity to help people get cushy jobs abroad. The whole idea of free/subsidised education is to benefit the country by having higher paid people working and paying tax. If they leave, that system fails.

He has it far to good here, he has his own little group of followers and sits on his arse typing shit on twitter all day. I guarantee if that cunt went to live in any sort of middle eastern country, he would miss his home comforts in a fortnight. He has now found his perfect excuse 'they won't let me travel to the Islamic state'.

I imagine we'd start the day round his mum's house with a bowl of coco pops and a cup of tea. We'd probably then go to the park for a kick about, and maybe play on the swings. None of the bigger boys would steal our ball because me and Flanno would be doing serious mazy runs around imaginary defenders. I think after the park we'd probably go to a sandwich shop. I think I'd get a chicken tikka baguette, but Flanno would keep it simple with just sausages or something. In the afternoon I imagine we'd get on the bus to his nan's residential home and pay her a visit. She'd be lovely, and would show me some photos of when Flanno was younger and had an embarrassing haircut, and Flanno would roll on the bed with his hands covering his face out of embarrassment. His nanna would probably then make us another sandwich, and we wouldn't tell her about the sandwich we'd had earlier because we know that she likes feeling like she's still looking after people. Then we'd have another cup of tea before heading off. After we'd said goodbye to his nanna we'd probably go to the cinema for an afternoon screening - Flanno's a professional footballer after all, he can do what he likes. I'm guessing they'd be showing a Marvel film of some variety, so we'd watch that. We'd get seats on the second to back row so we could see who was hooking up in the cinema. We wouldn't sit on the back row though because that might be a little bit gay - we're not 100% sure, but we don't want to risk it. After the film we go back to Flanno's mum's house. We get a taxi because Flanno's got bare money. While his mum makes tea we be building a fort in his bedroom, which would be awesome because as a professional footballer he would have a huge bedroom. Flanno's mum will have made us fishfingers, chips, and peas, and we'll ask if we can eat it in the fort, and she'll say no, but it won't be that big a deal. My mum will probably come to pick me up around 19:30. She'll talk to Flanno's mum for a bit while me and Flanno stand there awkwardly. Then we'll say goodbye and go home, and I'll tell my mum: ""yeah, it was ok"".

I'm sure of it. There are players where you instantly see that they are going to be *something* (like our Raheem and a young Gerrard, etc.), then there are players who you simply know aren't going to be good enough for the club (unfortunately, far too many supporters lump players into this category), and of course there are the players that are stuck in the middle and it's not as easily clear they will be amazing but they show enough potential where you think... 'Well this one just might...'

I think Henderson is one of those players that doesn't always clearly show the skills that seduce the ones who judge players based on FIFA, Football Manager, Fantasy Premier League, etc.

Henderson may never be the crucial piece of the puzzle like a Torres, Gerrard, Luis Suarez, maybe even Sturridge. But Henderson is the glue that brings everything together.

I have high hopes for the 24-year-old Henderson.

If you argue that the peak years for a player is between 26ish and 29ish (e.g. Suarez exploded with 31 goals in 37 appearances when he was 26-years-old) then you can imagine that Henderson will be a crucial part of LFC's success in the next couple years or so.

Furthermore, it's never satisfying to saying, 'You just wait, we'll be incredible in two or three years' especially considering the seemingly instant success of other clubs (i.e. remember when Southampton were supposed to be quote-unquote decimated after this summer?).

But... you just wait. I think we'll be incredible in two or three years and I think Henderson will be a big part of that success.",null,0,null,1420887635,null,0,false,0,cnkf56b,null,t3_2ry47b,null,t1_cnkf56b,null,t1_cnkev72,null,null,null,1424956066,null,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9,null

You may be right though, I don't think a Paulinho/Dembele midfield would put in enough energy for it to work. 

I see Capoue and Stambouli as our only defensive mids while Dembele, Paulinho, Mason and Bentaleb are all box to box. I don't think Stambouli has really earned a spot over Paulinho as he gotten lots of minutes as a sub. So I was thinking that our CM's would be of the non defensive variety.

It's about religious prejudice - since the DUP has a proud track record of supporting it.

However, the catch is that you can only withdraw it at official retirement age (around 65-67 depending on the states).

For she was sure she saw a Dalek over head.

Dark jackets lay astray on the floor

and fez was hanging off the TARDIS door.

A trenchcoat hung from a railing

""you see young Clara we must get asailing! 

the 11th doctor cried.

""If we don't leave soon it will be time to say good bye!""

But little did they know the dalek's evil plot

Was to exterminate christmas right here at this very spot

Lazers rained down over their heads.

But only little Clara looked on with dread.

Not a single doctor seemed to worry

with a snap of the fingers the doctors marched out

Did these doctors have a plan? Clara knew they was none.

But they would fend off this Dalek, of that there is no doubt.

And the doctor to take the lead of the bunch? Of cores it was number 1

Clara blinked and gazed out into the sun

""My dear child! Haven't you realized what I've done""

It was done already. The dalek fled.

Now it was over and Clara awoke in her bed.

We only see a small part of the managers work but everyone who interacts with him day to day hold him in the highest regard. For me that means he should stay for a long time.

In addition to that let's look at where we are with Rodgers. Yes we've had a shaky last few months (when we haven't had any goalscoring strikers available) but he's built a young team around him who are awash with potential and talent. Having these players developing together will do wonders for us in a few years. He also gave us the most exciting premier league run of the last two decades last year. If you look at the overall picture Rodgers has been and is a resounding success. Even this year we have seen flashes of what the team under Rodgers' philosophy is capable of. We're just going through a rough patch at the moment.

null,false,DanNeedleman,null,null,null,"I don't want Rodgers out now, but I do think he'll be gone at the end of the season and I won't have a problem with that. It's hard to pin the blame looking from the outside in but here's why I dont think he'll stay / don't want him to stay:

1. Money: He's blew an amazing amount on transfers and it's actually astounding, it could be blamed on the Transfer Committee but I think its obvious that up until Balotelli there weren't really many players bought against his will. The stats are well documented, to spend that much and be in the position we are now is laughable. People go on about Borini, that's an out and out Rodgers buy.

1. Youth mismanagement - I feel like he undeservedly gets a rep for being some great proponent of youth but realistically Sterling was already in the team and Flanagan was brought in due to injury. Do we need Assaidi, Alberto, Ilori etc when we have Suso, Texiera, Ibe, Wisdom in the wings? And if you are going to bring them in, why not play them? I think he doesn't give our Academy players enough of a chance, we only have to look at Man United to see academy players getting blooded in.

1.  Man mismanagement - I'm a bit of a Sakho fanboy tbh so this'll show here, but he obviously has issues with man management that are overshadowed by his success stories (Henderson, Suarez), Sakho was PSG's youngest captain and part of a squad that did very well in WC yet can't get into our backline? Reina and Agger are other examples.

1. Media - This is a bit of a silly one because it always depends with how you're doing on the pitch. When we were doing well I didn't care that Rodgers was saying the same thing week in week out, and tbh he could say anything and I wouldn't care, that all changes when you start losing though. Media are always going to twist things but the famous Tottenham and Southampton quotes, the handling of Balotelli show a lack of experience .

I don't think Rodgers is a bad manager and he's got swathes of good points. Last year definitely wasn't all Suarez no matter what anyone tells you and he definitely deserves alot of credit. I feel like we've moved forward under him, but his inexperience has definitely showed. I feel in order to progress further we'd have to get another manager, but Rodgers could definitely prove me wrong.

Anyone who watches sports knows about the ""letdown game"", also known as the ""trap game"". These are occurrences that usually follow a game in which the fan base (and the team themselves) become convinced that they have ""*turned the corner*"", as it were, on their season and that the team will come out in such blistering form for ever game to follow. Or for at least a patch. 

Sometimes it does happen, but those runs usually come against teams of middle to high quality. That's not really a trap game.

No, a trap game is when you play an otherwise ""garbage"" opponent after beating a big fish. 

Let's not kid ourselves. Professional sports have more parity nowadays than they have in decades. Every team can beat any other team on any given day. It may seem unlikely at times, but it's true - and we've seen it a lot over the past few years, especially in the Premier League.

So here we have a Spurs side that struggled quite a bit after their first few games and seemed doomed to finish closer to 10th than to 4th. But Poch has the lads playing out of sight at the moment, and Spurs are on a sensational run of form. The new year's day victory of table-topping Chelsea was the sensational accumulation of everything Pochettino had been training the lads to be. It was beautiful, it was pure sex.

And yet, here we are just 9 days later, ready to see our lads play their first Premier League match since that glorious day. And the game is the polar opposite. Crystal Palace are, by nearly all measurable statistics (except actual position in the table), the worst team in the Premiership at the moment. They're on a run of form so bad that their manager was sacked because of it. And the last time they won, Spurs fans in American hadn't even celebrated Thanksgiving yet.

Spurs, on the other hand, are *the* team in the Premier League. Harry Kane has the sports media talking, Pochettino is making pundits contradict statements from just a month or two ago, and they are coming off a sensational, season-defining thrashing of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea.

So this should be a walk in the park, eh boys?

Not so fast. I'm nervous as hell about this game.

Nine days can be long enough to get over the excitement of a big win, but it can also be nine days to dwell on the excitement and forget to get ready for the next team up.

Palace are a team under new management. Pardew has always done well at the start of a new gig and he'll look to lift the team and their much-maligned fans this afternoon. A win today would pull Palace from relegation-threatened to as high as 15th in table and all would be sunny again in South London. 

For Spurs, a loss could see them fall as far seventh, back behind West Ham and Arsenal and erasing all of the murmuring that this could be Spurs year to clinch fourth.

Ah shit. To be a football fan. Either everything in the world is going well, or it's all going wrong. And if you're a Spurs fan, even when everything is going right, you can't help but feel the underlying voices telling you that something *will* go wrong....eventually. Let's just hope that Merson and Lawro are wrong, and Spurs will produce the same exciting attack as they did at the start of the year against Chelsea.

I don't know the point of this long tirade. Maybe it's just cuz I'm drunk and needed something to do. But whatever.

To anyone going to the match: sing and support your focking ass off!

I described it already. When students start their MBBS they agree to work in the UK for a certain amount of time after qualifying. It's very simple. Many countries run similar programs. Many foreign students at top universities are on these programs where their government pay for them to study at Oxford on the basis that they will return home and work there for X number of years. Since UK education is incredible and medical training is some of the best in the world, why can't we apply similar conditions to our own people?

&gt;Most doctors won't leave for two years as it is now because they want to finish their training

Sure. But that's even longer where they're not really self-sufficient because they are still using up a lot of other doctors time.

&gt;you want to contract them for three years work in the NHS? Four? Five? Where does it end?

No it doesn't.

Islam, like Christianity is a bed of contradiction, two people can say they're Muslim/Christian but hold entirely different principles.

&gt;With the logic that this guy is proposing, the catholic church shouldn't have to apologies for men in their ranks molesting children. If we're going to lay the burden of apologising on behalf of pedophiles on the Pope and followers of the catholic faith, then why can't we do the same for other leaders and followers of different faiths?

Because Catholicism is a centralized religion with a Spiritual leader claiming responsibility for the followers, Islam isn't. Muslims in Bradford have a different spiritual leader than those in London, who differ from those in France who further differ from those who follow Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

The nearest comparison you can do is if you asked Protestants or Orthodox Christians to apologise on behalf of Catholics. ",null,0,null,1420891457,null,0,false,0,cnkftt7,null,t3_2ryao2,null,t1_cnkftt7,null,t1_cnkfonw,null,null,null,1424955747,null,57,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,57,null

Probably worth pointing out that Labour left them with a bunch of spending commitments. You know - a pair of new (crippled) carriers, a commitment to the F35 project that would cost more to buy our way out of (in favour of cheaper to buy, cheaper to run alternatives) than to just run with.

It's not exactly Osborne's fault that Labour left us not only with a huge deficit and debt, but a toxic legacy of ongoing commitments which Osborne has not been able to shift - they tried to change the order on the F35s to something cheaper, but when it turned out BAE hadn't actually designed the carriers the way we asked for them, that turned out to be impossible.

In domestic terms, Labour not only maxed out the credit cards, they also went and signed us up to a bunch of ""buy now, pay later"" deals.

Well for one, gunsmiths. I know one pistol specialist who had to emigrate to America in 1997 when they banned pistols (gun crime subsequently soared all the way through to 2004, what a wildly successful ploicy that was...). That was his trade, and the government outlawed it. He actually makes substantially more in the US than he ever did in the UK but he'd trade all that to come home. Because the UK *is* his home and they economically exiled him. There are a variety of other people I know who have had to move abroad because non-economic policies have had knock ons in their maret sector that means the UK is no longer a competitive place to try and do those things.

null,false,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,null,"I think the gist is working late shifts and weekends is becoming ever more normalised in society and those hours are no longer so ""anti social"". 

Everyone I know who works shifts and is paid extra for anti-social hours fights to get those shifts. Some of them do the rotas and it is a priority to ration out Sundays because of the shitstorm if anyone doesn't get their share. Then there's the people who only want to work Sundays etc for other reasons - usually childcare. For some the other parent is 9-5 therefore ""anti social hours"" means a shift without incurring childcare costs, for others anything outside 9-5 is prohibitive because of childcare. 

Surely this is telling that the problem isn't anti-social hours, it's that the basic rate is so shit it has to be offset with a lucrative shift? We have people wanting to work those hours who cannot because of the people who do not want those hours but have to to top-up their earnings. It's hard not to assume it is a bit of a manipulation, perhaps because the employer is committed to the basic rate payroll but has a much freer hand to control lucrative shifts and therefore control the wage bill?

Of course this isn't an absolute thing. There's still elements of anti-social about working on a Sunday. It's just the severity isn't what it used to be. To me this suggests that the rates should be rebalanced to reflect this, shifting some of the Sunday extra onto the basic rate. Let the people who *want* to work Sundays for reasons other than payrate get those shifts and let people who don't want to work Sundays not be dependent on working them.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"Borini, eh? Interesting.

Say what you want about Brendan Rodgers, but one endearing quality that Rodgers has is his sense of romanticism and his belief that players can rise to the occasion.

I have to say that as cynical as I am, I do love Rodgers' romanticism.

Here is Rodgers putting the seldom-used Borini in the starting XI and asking him to rise to the occasion against Sunderland; The same club where he spent last season on loan, scored some important goals, and the club where he almost ended up moving to permanently.

That being said, I am not very pro-Borini like some supporters.

I am convinced that he seduces clubs and managers with his *potential* but his frequent transfers/loans suggests to me that he doesn't quite have what it takes.

However, for some inexplicable reason, I sympathize with him and I admire his self-confidence and dedication to the sport in spite of the fact that he has bounced around so frequently from club to club. Footballers aren't robots, they are human, and for a young player it must be difficult to be so far away from home and move from club to club attempting to make new friends and be comfortable in a new city with each move he makes.

I'd imagine it'd be like if you moved from a new school to new school every year.

Then I remind myself that Fabio Borini is *only* 23-years-old.

Then, like our Brendan Rodgers, I start to get misty-eyed with romanticism and start to think, well, maybe this **is** the turning point for Borini. Or at the very least, maybe he will score that important goal for us and lead us to 3 points.

I hope so.

Why would it apply to other subjects? Those people work in private industry, government jobs or research institutes. Doctors are trained pretty much exclusively for the NHS. I don't see why Engineers or Physicists would be included at all. They are nowhere near as expensive or ""costly"" (in terms of resources, time etc), nor are they trained for any particular vocation or job role. That's a very big difference right there.

PhDs... it depends. Most non-STEM PhDs like English, History etc are self-funded, so they would be tied by nothing at all since they paid for it themselves. 

If someone is funded by a research institute then it would be up to that institute to enact whatever terms they want, and there probably would be a valid argument for requiring them to stay in the UK if they were funded. 

However, generally the universities will get a return on students because PhD students publish papers which makes supervisors look good and helps the University attract more grant money. 

Also consider that jobs after a PhD are not guaranteed in the way they are after an MBBS. With an MBBS you are expected to work in the NHS. After a PhD there's no expectation whether you go into academia, industry, government etc.

This isn't like a young player with 3 or 4 seasons to grow in a variety of positions - he'll be starting CM and captain in 7 months time.

Easily. Wow, I really hope you aren't actually a Doctor. Your critical thinking (or maybe just reading comprehension if you're skim reading) is very poor!

You don't ""prevent"" anybody from moving. I'm not suggesting arresting doctors at the airport or issuing them visas like a north korean diplomat visiting the West. 

You just treat it like a student loan through PAYE so the cost is automatically deducted from the paycheque. If the doctor is working in the NHS (or somewhere else agreed), no deductions. If they work elsewhere, deduction. If they move abroad, treat it the same as a student loan where they try to chase you for the money and if you come back, you start making payments again.

This could all be very simply specified in a contract signed by someone before they start their MBBS.

&gt;Not only is that totally unenforceable but it's insane.

Easily enforceable. And 10 years service is nothing. You'd only be mid-30s by the time it's up.

The exchange on the radio saying the terrorists didn't do it in the name of ""his Islam"" makes it sound like his point was its just an issue of individual vs collective responsibility - that individual Muslims do not have collective responsibility for each others actions. I'm just adding that it's not just that one Muslim is not responsible for the actions of another but also that ""Islam"" isn't a single universal concept - there are Sunnis, shias, wahabis, ahmedis etc and some (like the core sect behind ISIS) do not believe many other sects to actually be a part of Islam.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I recognise that this is frustrating but we have to look beyond the results and look at Rodgers as a person and as a manager:

* It is clear that Rodgers comes from a strong coaching pedigree (i.e. being involved with Mourinho).
* Rodgers certainly has the respect of his players.
* His ability to speak multiple languages shows his awareness of how the game is changing (i.e. more foreign players in England) and shows his dedication to connect with his players whether they speak English or not.
* And respect comes from how he rewards players who work hard in training (and vice-versa).
* Generally speaking, he is tactically progressive and is regarded as an intellectual.
* Rodgers is young, ambitious and hungry; Hungry for the ability to prove himself at a big club.
* When Rodgers was hired, didn't we all love how he seemed to say all the right things? There were the stories of him meeting all of the staff including the tea lady. Changing the nets to red. Showing his love, knowledge and romanticism for history. etc. etc.

Now bring us to present day:

* Rodgers inadvertently fucked himself by finish 2nd in the league last season. How many supporters do you hear cry, 'But we finished *second* last season!!1! Now look at us.'
* Rodgers lost the top scorer in the Premier League last season: Luis Suarez.
* Rodgers has been without the services of the second highest goal scorer in the League last season: Daniel Sturridge.
* I'd argue that not even Ferguson, Mourinho or whoever would have been able to produce consistently satisfactory results after the losses of the two top goal scorers in the League last season.
* Now combine all that with the difficulty of luring 'marquee' players to a Liverpool club that has struggled for many seasons, a club who has failed to consistently qualify for the Champions League in recent years.
* Combine that with the fact that we simply cannot *outbid* clubs like Chelsea and Man City; We have a lot of money but not the sort of money that can outbid City or Chelsea.
* Which results in putting the burden of success on the shoulders of very promising but also very young footballers.

Ultimately, what happened was the worst case scenario. Everything that could go wrong in the post-Suarez world *did* go wrong:

* The loss of Suarez was a big deal.
* The loss of Sturridge made the loss of Suarez a *bigger* deal.
* The transfers didn't show immediate returns/success.
* Rodgers stubbornly held on to certain players/tactics before ultimately shifting to suit to the squad (we've certainly looked better since then).

OK. So now what?

Well. I don't think sacking Rodgers now will do us any good. And as long as continue to show clear improvements, I'm not entirely sure if Rodgers should even be sacked in the summer.

And even if we do sack Rodgers... is there an overwhelmingly clear choice for a new manager? I personally do not think so.

The un-sexy answer is that we have to be patient.

I think it would be foolish to sack Rodgers now. I think it would be foolish to sack Rodgers in the summer. I think Rodgers deserves the January window, the remainder of the season, the summer transfer window and much of the following season... then I can reassess the situation.",null,0,null,1420893904,null,0,false,0,cnkgb0p,null,t3_2rye7x,null,t1_cnkgb0p,null,t3_2rye7x,null,null,null,1424955524,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I know you said a cheap car but the average is around £3500 a year to run a car apparently. [Source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2514297/3-500-year-makes-Britain-expensive-place-run-car.html)

Without trying too hard to budget with food (everybody loves buying a biscuit every now and then) I think a reasonable figure for a weekly shop is around £35, but that's easy to get wrong. Which is another £1820.

Broadband, mobile, gas, electric, water, TV license. That could easily push into the realm of £3000 a year using some of [these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22065978) numbers.

Maybe mine are a bit high but that gives us £8500. Which gives £4146 a year as ""disposable"". Around £345 a month. I'll allow my imaginary guy one social night a week so he doesn't go stir crazy; maybe £20 a week? Now it is down to around £250 a month. Not taking account any insurance or money put away for a rainy day.

In truth I think neither of our figures are anywhere near accurate. 

&gt; If you have £2000 of disposable income in the bank, £200 seems like a reasonable treat for yourself. £30,000 seems like an unimaginable fortune.

It shouldn't be strange to point out that some people are buying face washes monthly at £30,000 a go; more money than entire households do in a year.

And all these things have gradually been eroded by political correctness, which seems to me to be about an institutionalised politeness at its worst. And if there is some fallout from this, which means that someone in an office might get in trouble one day for saying something that someone was a bit unsure about because they couldn't decide whether it was sexist or homophobic or racist, it's a small price to pay for the massive benefits and improvements in the quality of life for millions of people that political correctness has made. 

It's a complete lie that allows the right, which basically controls media now, and international politics, to make people on the left who are concerned about the way people are represented look like killjoys. 

And I'm sick, I'm really sick-- 84% of you in this room that have agreed with this phrase, you're like those people who turn around and go, ""you know who the most oppressed minorities in Britain are? White, middle-class men."" You're a bunch of idiots.

Maybe they recognise collective punishment for the complete brain-dead act of idiocy that it is, and they recognise that demanding a collective apology of a race or religion implies collective responsibility, which means you've already crossed the Rubicon on the way to such dull-headed stupidity.

Work outside the NHS, pay an extra amount (just like your student loan) to repay your tuition costs. Move abroad, and they chase you just like the student loan company chases people. Come back, they chase you for the missed payments.

&gt;The onus is on the country to keep its people here, not on the individual.

If you were told that your degree would cost £100,000 in loans or you could get another degree for much less, which would you pick? Even if you phrase it as ""It's free if you work for the NHS for 10 years"" these students are the usually amongst the best candidates for university (The lowest course requirements I could find in the UK was AAA at A level and B at AS), and could easily work elsewhere - why on earth would they want to buy into this loan? Do you want the best candidates to continue applying for medicine, or do you want them to study something else and end up with second-rate doctors with lower academic results? 

Personally I'd rather offer doctors more to stay, having already made this investment in their training, than to force them to stay by making them liable for this investment. 

The nation has invested, I'm sure, a fair few thousands of pounds in simply keeping me alive - should I have to pay that back before I leave the country? Will I get billed for my NHS record, an invoice for my school and a demand for me to return any benefits I've claimed? I went to a gallery and might have been culturally enriched by looking at a painting - how much do I owe the Government before I go?

Massacres of unimaginable brutality, slavery, organised rape and murder, absolute bloodthirsty destruction are to be found throughout history.  Maybe it's not Christianity which causes it, or Islam, or Zen buddhists in Imperial Japan any more than it was atheism in Cambodia, or the Ukraine or China, or Paganism before.  The Mongols caused, proportionately more destruction than anyone and they had no real creed or cause.  Maybe it's just a flaw in people, and maybe we're the freaks.  We're not being blown up every day by drone strikes etc. so our views are relatively peaceable and tolerant.  But how quickly that disappears into irrational collective blaming.

Sorry man, I wasn't trying to be critical of your maths. 

&gt;Sure, one can question the actual value of a £30,000 facial but the point was that when you have the vast quantities of money that the very wealthy have, £30,000 doesn't seem like very much.

And I think other people's point (my own point included) is that it is awful that we are in a situation where people have £30,000 to blow on a facial and others are using food banks.

&gt;The point is, we all already spend vastly more than some people earn in a year for what we consider essentials like car ownership or weekly groceries, when most could do without the car or shop cheaper.

Well groceries are essential. I hate this weird idea that poor people should just be living on oats and microwaves. It is of course possible to spend less on groceries, just to drink water and never have anything taste remotely edible. The same can't be said of transport though. Running a car is expensive but even a bus pass is almost £1000 a year. Which only gives you an extra £50 a week.

Plus the average work week is 43 hours. Taking out 8 hours sleep a day and an hour's commute every day only gives you about 8 hours a day to live. Standard household chores can easily be a few hours a day; cleaning, fixing things, paying bills and general housery. Then you have eating and washing. Maybe people have only around 4 hours a day to spend their £35 daily ""fun"" allowance in.

Again my maths is way off. I just don't think the average Briton earns enough or even has enough free time. Considering we are a first world country I just think something is a bit amiss. Taking into account that the median income seems to be falling while income at the top rises. It just all annoys me.

If that isn't fascism I don't know what is. Devotion to the state at the expense of individual prospects is the absolute core tenet of fascism. 

Every single young person in university is, at the current time, a massive net drain on the government (who do you think pays for the decades of education and child benefit? not the child...). Never mind university loans, tuition is still heavily subsidised by the state and that money only ever comes back to the coffers if these students remain in the UK and pay taxes for decades. 

Don't you understand how ridiculous your idea would become? There is no logical reason why we should only restrict NHS trainee's from emigrating, as NHS bursaries are only a small part of the state funding for a doctors education/training, it naturally follows that we should clamp down on ALL emigration, because these people have been raised, educated and funded by the UK government, and after they emigrate the government will get nothing back. 

The issue is your idea just isn't possible in a globalised world. You can't stop people leaving, you can't realistically chase people for debts in a country halfway across the world unless their governments cooperate with you. There's a reason why no other developed country has tried this crap. It's far easier to just raise wages  to compete with the wider world rather than try to fight against peoples natures.

null,false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yaakshur,null,"&gt; The people who say ""political correctness gone mad"" are often the extremists, but they're not completely wrong.  
  
Just because the phrase means different things to different people doesn't mean the person who utters it can't be completely and utterly wrong.
  
  
People being arrested over tweets has to do with the phrasing and interpretation of the Communications Act 2003, which updates the Malicious Communications Act 1988, which in turn makes reference to communications that are [indecent or grossly offensive](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/27/section/1). Although the idea behind the legislation is laudable (it's aimed at poison-pen letters, serious threats of intimidation &amp; violence, threats to kill and so on), the meaning of these words is IMO open to too much debate and is aimed at far too wide a target. Still, the thrust of the problem has more to do with poor choice of words, the fact that real-world cases involving threats are unlikely to be clear-cut, and over-exuberant policing, than it does with a general attempt to ban what people can say.  
  
    
Attempting to prevent people from stirring up racial and/or religious hatred, meanwhile, is a Good Thing, as anyone who thinks for one moment about what that might mean *cough* Nazis *cough*. Stirring up religious hatred isn't the same thing at all as ""taking the piss out of religion"", or even ""hating religion in general"" - it's provoking or urging other people to hate [a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/1/schedule). I.e. it's legislation that aims to prevent hate of *people*, not *religion*. The problem is that the legislation is represented in popular belief (and some sections of the press) as being aimed at the latter rather than the former whereas the legislation is simply another instance of ""Play the ball, not the man"".  
  
  
Another Good Thing is a general societal trend where it is unacceptable to address other ethnic groups using racial slurs. This is because racial slurs are often the product of the kind of negative stereotypical thinking (e.g. ""all niggers are thieves"") that has no place in polite society. If you do it you're a making a twat of yourself and deserve the disapprobation of your fellow human beings.  
  
  
Meanwhile a Bad Thing is the whole kerfuffle over people allowing the fear of being called a racist to affect their better judgement. This seems to have arisen from confusion and/or feature creep from the previous Good Thing. What should be the case is that it's OK to form judgements on groups of people grouped by nationality, race or religion, as long as it's formed from evidence that's not biased, stereotypical or limited. What actually appears to have happened is that sometimes it has become taboo to group people by nationality, race or religion for fear that this act of grouping is itself biased. On the contrary: Grouping things based on factual evidence is what is called 'science'. Just make sure that it actually *is* factual evidence or you'll end up making a tit out of yourself.

And thank for mentioning for te UK transport sector because it' a great example. Take the railway companies in the UK; they can not be called a market. Wanna know why? We subsidise train companies to a greater extent than to what we paid the government run train system. So what does this mean? Well it means that we have government supported monopolies and government supported pricing that can not be competitive because the government subsidises the current companies. It is not a market. And the only way for this sector to show improvements in the future is to remove these subsidies.

You're saying the same crap about profit again unfortunately. Companies do not settle for the basic and bare minimum effective way of making money; if there is demand for something, then a market will appear for it. Same for human health; any health issue that people have,  it will be in a company's interest to provide a service for it.  And if one hospital provides a service, another will attempt to provide a better one in order to maximise profit.  Your statement ""...the service only has to be good enough for people to use it..."" is so ridiculous  because it's the conclusion that some leftist arrive to when talking about nationalised health services; they admit that it is a fundamental problem with nationalised health; there is no incentive.

And also you don't want to live in a country where that happens? And what makes you think, yet again, that it is in a company's best interest to let a customer die on the street? Are you really that unreasonable that you can't see the ramifications of a privatised hospital not accepting a dying person on the street? It is entirely profitable to make sure that person lives and it is entirely profitable to make sure that reasonable payment plans are set up AND it is entirely profitable to make sure the message is sent out to people that this hospital accepts everyone; otherwise everyone will go he hospital  that has jumped on the chance to fill a hole in the market.",null,0,null,1420899426,null,0,false,0,cnkhno6,null,t3_2rq79b,null,t1_cnkhno6,null,t1_cnilavt,null,null,null,1424954892,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Also shows the second half might be a harder run of fixtures.

We just replaced an IBM 390 platform ""synchronised"" (I use that term loosely) with an old ASP/COM system for integration with a new platform. Took 5 years of work for about 20 people. Non trivial and resulted in about 600,000 lines of C# and an entire new front end, back end, schema, infrastructure deployment and integration system as well as training 2500 people on how to use it and migrating them piecemeal.

Turning off the 390 had people all over the organisation shitting themselves literally. Everything the company did was via that. Even though it was ported over, there was a mysticism that it was like euthanizing a human and there were a million what if scenarios.

COBOL programmers still make a bank but usually only long enough to shelve the platform. Unless you just bought a z9/z10, then you're safe...

Second relevant part:

Well there you go, that's the objective. It doesn't always have to mean ""I want to do X by Y date"". Tell your adviser exactly what you've said here.

&gt; What is the difference between fixed fee/hourly? 

If you were concerned that charges might rack up when using an hourly rate, then it may be more beneficial to ask about fixed fees. At least you know at outset what the costs are then. It really comes down to preference and whether your adviser is willing to accommodate it.

&gt; As I understand it he takes a fee (%) out of new products which are opened. This is normal, yes?

Usually initial charges are a % of the investment. They don't have to be, again an adviser may be prepared to work on a fixed fee basis.

&gt; My other concern is that their man's firm is quite upmarket and (I expect) comparatively expensive. I have no idea if this is justified for my position in life and I don't know if it's worth it for me. How would I go about asking this? I know it is my money but I want to be tactful.

""Upmarket"" is all a matter of perspective. Some firms are quite open about the fact that they'll only work with high net worth clients, the fact that the adviser is working with you should mean that you fall within their target ""market"" so don't be concerned that you're not the right fit for them. You could ask them if they have a minimum level of investment that they'll work with. Some advisers won't work with people with less than a few hundred thousand pounds because they see people with less as not being profitable. We're not all like that though, there are plenty of firms that don't impose those kind of barriers.

As I said before though, it works both ways, so if you don't feel comfortable working with them or you think that you don't quite fit in with their upmarket brand then look for someone that's more suited to you. As for them being expensive, you won't really know how they compare unless you speak to other IFAs in the area to see what they charge.",null,0,null,1420900926,null,0,false,0,cnki3w2,null,t3_2ruiyh,null,t1_cnki3w2,null,t1_cnjx4ws,null,null,null,1424954682,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

First off, I think they're generally not appropriate to have as your only job, they are however often suitable for extra/flexible work.

Mine and friends experiences of them has only ever been positive. As students we were able to take shifts as and when we were available - if we turned the shifts down, no hard feelings, they'd find someone else in the pool and we'd still get offered work again in future. 

I know some people now that have permanent part time work and supplement their income with zero-hours work from various places - theatre work, bar work, event work etc. They've typically got enough work coming in to do 50 hours a week if they want, with great flexibility. 

If zero hours contracts were to be outlawed, what is the alternative for the use-cases where they're genuinely appropriate (eg. irregular events work)?

- Lucas was brilliant today. Won tackles. Made interceptions. Made productive passes. Together with Henderson, they make a decent CM partnership.
- The back three really need Can for the extra pace and ability to bring the ball forward and to make a decent pass. Sakho-Škrtel-Lovern is far too static and unstable. 
- Mignolet's kicking was decent.

Luis Suarez has a biting message for Brendan Rodgers - that Steven Gerrard is simply irreplaceable.

The controversial Uruguayan striker, who quit Liverpool for Barcelona in the summer, insists that the Anfield captain’s decision to head for Los Angeles Galaxy this summer will leave an impossible hole to fill in the Reds midfield.

Suarez valued his close relationship with Gerrard throughout the trials and tribulations of his pyrotechnic spell on Merseyside – crediting the skipper with persuading him to stay after he received a 10-match banned for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic in 2013.

After Suarez sank his teeth into Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at last summer’s World Cup, his £75million exit to the Nou Camp was sealed.

Yet the baddest man on planet football still holds Gerrard in high esteem and believes he can inspire Liverpool to Champions League qualification before heading to California.

Suarez said: “There are a small number of players in the world that are irreplaceable, and Steven is one of them. Not just irreplaceable as a player, but also as a captain, and what he represents for Liverpool.

“Liverpool are a great team though, big players will want to play for them. They have great midfield players already there who can make a step up - and I am sure the boss is already thinking about replacements.

“Steven will always be somebody I respect as a player and a person. He has had a big impact on my career.

“He told me to give Liverpool another season and leave if Barcelona wanted me. That is probably the most important advice I have ever taken.”

Suarez, who won the Footballer of the Year award for his 31 goals last season, knows Liverpool have struggled to replace him.

But he has backed troubled boss Rodgers to lead his old club back into the Champions League, either by finishing in the top four or by winning the Europa League.

He said: “It has not been the perfect start for the season for Liverpool, especially with expectation growing after last season. I am sure they will be fine though, and I am even more sure that they are under the right guidance.

“Brendan is a good man and a great coach. All the players like him, they respect him, and they want to play for him. I am sure they are going to be successful under him.

“It is important that the club are in the Champions League. With the tradition they have in the competition that is what the fans demand.

“This season is not over for them. They have two routes into the Champions League next season, and I am sure they can reach it.”

Suarez is adamant that Gerrard is not going into semi-retirement by playing in Major League Soccer but believes he will return to Anfield in the future.

He added: “I know Steven well. He won’t be looking at the LA Galaxy move as a chance to relax and enjoy the weather. When he plays the only way he plays is to win.

“I know that his motive for the move will be because he wants to play every game – and win many more trophies.

“I can’t speak about what Steven’s plans are after he retires from the game, only he will know if he wants to go into coaching or not.

“All I can say is that it would never surprise me to see him return to Liverpool in some capacity. To say he loves the club would not do his feelings for Liverpool justice, Liverpool is a part of him.”

Suarez has scored just once in nine La Liga matches for Barca, after his suspension for biting Chiellini expired in October.

And the Catalans are in chaos as boss Luis Enrique is at war with superstar Lionel Messi, while sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has left after a 14-month transfer ban for breaching rules on signing young players was upheld last week.

But Suarez, who faces champions Atletico Madrid in the Nou Camp tomorrow, insists he will win trophies with Barca.

He said: “I want to be successful this season and win trophies with Barcelona, which is why I joined this great club.

“I look at my teams-mates who have been here many years like Xavi and Messi and I am jealous of all their medals. That is what I want.

“It’s a big game against Atletico, they are champions for a reason. I am sure Fernando Torres will be a good signing for them.

“You don’t just lose your ability. If he is back playing regularly I am sure he will find the form he had at Liverpool.”

Suarez, 27, will return to English soil next month when Barca visit Manchester City in the last sixteen of the Champions League.

But he said: “The fact I am facing English opposition in the Champions League means nothing.

""All that matters is that in Manchester City we are facing one of the best teams in Europe so it is important we are at our best.”

As a disclaimer, I fully agree with the talk show hosts opinion.

My question is doesn't this viewpoint of who's to blame not exempt people from say all people in Germany for what happened during the war as they had no part in it? Would this mean that they can basically say it's no big deal what happened because it wasn't them?

How about our country and slavery or the numerous atrocities Britain is responsible for? Do we no longer take responsibility because it wasn't us personally that did it?
How about the recent wars in Afghanistan or Iraq where we bombed civilians by accident, do we as the British community shrug it off and blame it on a couple of people?
I am fully of the opinion that we don't need a mass apology from the Islamic community, but I am curious to see at what point it becomes necessary to do so, if at all.

You may not be aware that commission on investment business has been banned since January 2013. All IFAs have to charge a fee now, whether that's hourly, fixed or % based.

A typical initial commission may have been anywhere between 3-5%. A lot of firms that were used to charging on a commission basis have kept the same structure with % based fees.

&gt; On a point of principle, I won't pay professionals on a commission basis, and I shall be seeking an IFA who'll work on an hourly rate. I believe this is the usual recommendation of this subreddit. I want someone who can sit there, dish his advice and wisdom and has nothing to gain or lose from the transaction. 

And this is precisely why commission was removed. Removing that bias of what pays the adviser the best *should* turn into better outcomes for clients.

More to the point, this of idea of ""his Islam"" speaks to an unwillingness to confront the fact that Islam is in general hostile to liberalism, just as Christianity is in general hostile to it. Instead of addressing the fact that Muslims tend to be more hostile to LGBT communities, a woman's right to have an abortion and the right to offend than the rest of the UK, the tendency among some is to reduce Islam to a mere name that anybody can wear with no moral baggage. 

Even if most British Muslims condemn summary executions, there are plenty that do not believe one should have the right to satirise religious figures ([from 2006](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/291)):

&gt; 78% of Muslims thought that the publishers of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed should be prosecuted, 68% thought those who insulted Islam should be prosecuted and 62% of people disagree that freedom of speech should be allowed even if it insults and offends religious groups.

Which is to say that a lot of them believed, at least then, that if you publish a cartoon they did not like the police should drag you off to prison – which is to say they believe in a violent reprisal for such an ""offence"". They may bear no responsibility for what happened in Paris, but the ideology is pretty troubling all the same.

Would this mean that they can basically say it's no big deal what happened because it wasn't them?

There were a lot of Germans who took part in what happened to the people who were exterminated by various means. A fuckton. Most of those who were complicit claimed not to have known about what was happening. This is lies.

The idea that the German people should apologise for Nazism in perpetuity is stupid because if people are forced to apologise for things that they are not responsible for then the apologies become meaningless as apologies and take on some other meaning. Most modern Germans recognise that what happened was bad and the only ones that say it was no big deal are the neo-Nazis.

With slavery, I don't feel like I should apologise, it was nothing to do with me. I do recognise that there should probably be reparations to the enslaved as a trans-generational advantage accrued to the slavers and their descendants from the trade and a similar inherited disadvantage was passed to the slaves and their offspring.

US shows use a similar system afaik. BBT has an audience who sit there and laugh. The actors pause and time their delivery to the laughs.

A lot of people mention Cahill's inability to play a high pressing game in the sense that he doesn't have the physicality nor that sort of defensive technical ability that Zouma and Luiz do who thrive in that sort of system.

Cahill's game and his defensive technical ability is relatively similar to Terry's although (of course) not up to his level.

Cahill and Terry dominated last season because we didn't play that much of a high-line. This did however start occur with the introduction of Matic halfway last season, and furthermore with the acquisition of Fabregas this season where we've been a  lot more further up the pitch. 

However, both Terry and Cahill together aren't an ideal pairing when it comes to breaking up counters. This has been even more clearly illustrated by Ivanovic's offensive game which whilst *really* good leaves us quite vulnerable in the back. Need I mention the Spur's game?

What I'm trying to say his once we get to the phasing out of Terry, whether we like it or not Cahill is relatively good enough to shift into Terry's position allowing someone Zouma to shift in giving us a bit more defensive balance for the high-press possession game we play.

Will do, thank you.

&gt;""Upmarket"" is all a matter of perspective. Some firms are quite open about the fact that they'll only work with high net worth clients, the fact that the adviser is working with you should mean that you fall within their target ""market"" so don't be concerned that you're not the right fit for them. You could ask them if they have a minimum level of investment that they'll work with. Some advisers won't work with people with less than a few hundred thousand pounds because they see people with less as not being profitable. We're not all like that though, there are plenty of firms that don't impose those kind of barriers.

My concern is that, up until now, my money and my father's money has been treated in the same way. He has always paid the hourly fees, and the investment plans are for the 'whole pot' (including his money). The reason I think this arrangement may be inappropriate for me is that my money makes up only a small chunk of this pot. Now that I want to be independent, does it make sense for someone with £100-150k assets to have an IFA?

&gt;As I said before though, it works both ways, so if you don't feel comfortable working with them or you think that you don't quite fit in with their upmarket brand then look for someone that's more suited to you.

I understand what you are saying but I'm not sure that I even need/benefit from an IFA at all. I'd like to find out (either directly from this man or from you/some other source) whether I need/benefit from his services, and I have no idea how to go about doing that or even what questions to ask.

&gt;As for them being expensive, you won't really know how they compare unless you speak to other IFAs in the area to see what they charge.

May I ask what you charge? I am based in London if that makes any difference.

Sorry but that is absolute utter bullshit. British people want to do those jobs but are being excluded because of basically outright racism. 

I've been delivering and collecting from these places for over 20 years. They were staffed wholly by British people employed directly by the companies. Over the years since 2004 there's been a massive change from employing British people on normal full-time contracts to employing Eastern Europeans via employment agencies on zero hours contracts. Its got to the point in many companies, especially the food factories, that other than management nearly all employees are non-British.

The civilians have Europe have *never* been more stable or more secure than in the last 40 years.  Terrorism is nothing compared with the constant assaults on people's safety which have plagued Europeans over the centuries.  

Just no.  You are in no sense aware of history or current affairs.

Also, just in the last 40 years, ETA has killed more EU Civilians than Islamic Terror, never mind the UDA, UVF, IRA, CIRA, RIRA, FLNC, PKK etc. e.g. In 2006 there were 500 terror attacks in the EU, and only one was caused by Islamic terror.  In 2011, of the 174 terrorist attacks, 110 were separatists, 37 were left wing, 1 was right wing, 26 were not specified and 0 were religiously inspired.  Terror campaigns are certainly not limited to the last 40 years either, so your statement that it ""probably for the first time"" can be answered with a very clear ""definitely not"", and the idea that there's something uniquely bad about Islamic threat can be answered in exactly the same way.

Sakho's back in as a regular and I still think Lovren can do a job. Sturridge is an eternal wildcard but imagine our pace going forward if and when he's back. I'm optimistic and I think the players are. We need more players like Coutinho, Marko, Can and Sakho moving the ball up confidently and taking on players. I'm also sure Henderson will get better when played centrally with Sturridge up top and us not inviting pressure. Most of our goals against are a result of 5 minutes of defensive madness and there's a lot less of that lately, which is why we've lost 1 in 13. Sakho's been a revelation and I don't think Brendan got much wrong in this game besides the Lovren/Gerrard sub, which could have happened around the 65 minute mark instead.

The general secretary and 'heads of department' (IT, HR, Organising, etc.) in the union can't just decide 'fuck it, we're going to say and do this' it all goes through and from the council - the members decide our direction and purpose.

We also have branches, which are member lead units of the union that work and campaign on specific things - and again, shape and direct the union.  Yes, we have a national officer looking after health, but if the branch at, say, George Eliot Hospital want to concentrate on a specific event they can - no bullying from the top, just direction and support.

You appear not to know about them, no.  I've shown you reports that separatist and political terrorist groups have been more more active in recent years than Islamic groups.  The RIRA still very much active.  You don't really seem able to cope with well sourced facts very well.

&gt;The difference with Islamic terror is the scale of targets, the purpose of the attacks. A town market is a viable target for them, and who else?

The RIRA, clearly, hence Omagh.  In the last 10 years, of the 174 people killed by terrorism in the EU, less than half have been killed by Islamists.

&gt;And according to you, we've never been safer...so let's stop discussing the issues that effect us.

Maybe you'd do better if you didn't put words into people's mouths and misspell 'effect' while you were at it.  I never said we shouldn't discuss it.  I'm discussing it right now.  I'm discussing it with you, in case you haven't noticed.

Saying we've never been safer is a clearly demonstrable fact, which just a cursory glance at history would confirm.  It's not ""according to me"".  

It doesn't prove we shouldn't discuss it.  It just proves that you're wrong.  

It doesn't prove we shouldn't care, but 174 deaths over 10 years in a population of 500,000,000 people averages out at 0.035 per million people, per year.

Still, journals tend to like to stick to one style, so the British Journal of Sociology will usually be written in British English and the American Journal of Sociology in American English and this will be done regardless of the author. Presumably the editor changes it or the authors are given guidelines before publication.

There also tends to preferences in Academia which are different to standard British English. So the use of ""z"" (standardize, globalization etc) is most common. However, it should be noted that both ""z"" and ""s"" are perfectly acceptable in British English and it isn't really an American/British thing, more just the different styles were standardised differently in different contexts (different much?). 

There is certainly no international standard and I notice (continental) Europeans tend to vary in which style they use. Publications from Canada, Australia and New Zealand use their own particular forms of English.

I'm also fully aware that sitcoms that are filmed mostly outside are then shown to an audience to get their reactions - the programme I usually use when I mention this point is Series 7 of Red Dwarf which was filmed and then shown to an audience, unlike the rest of the series (except 'Back to Earth' which was filmed and shown without studio laughter). 

It was US sitcoms that I was making the point, which again I read in a book while looking at something else while at University which is why I can't cite my source, that the canned laughter is exactly that - a recording that is played out at moments, often to enhance the studio laughter or to increase the effect of a 'joke'.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"&gt; Just like the IRA's border campaign in the 1950's, 60's it's useless and ineffective burt they see it as a way to transfer skills and Republican sentiment onto the next generation who will take up the fight when called. They believe that in 2016 the people will rise up and there will be another 'troubles' in the future.

That's an entirely wrong reading of history. The Border campaign Ended because the IRA realised it was [pointless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Campaign_%28Irish_Republican_Army%29#End_of_the_Campaign), they stood the Army down and withdrew all active service units. The IRA viewed the Border campaign as an utter failure, it gained no support whatsover. There is a disturbing myth circulating now in Republican circles that the Border Campaign was simply to keep *the flame alive*; that the torch would be passed on to a new generation. That is total bullshit; it could not have been further from the truth. 

Following the failed Border campaign the IRA and various Republican groups sought a new avenue for struggle, but that did not necessarily mean violence or armed confrontation with the state, but for agitation and civil disobedience. These discussions led to the formation of the NICRA, the IRA had effectively committed themselves to Non-Violence. We of course had the benefit of hindsight now; the Civil Rights Movement was met with extreme violence from both state and non-state actors and thus erupting into the violence we now know as *the troubles*. If you read the history it is very clear that was never the intention or motivation of the IRA at the time.

I'm also fully aware that sitcoms that are filmed mostly outside are then shown to an audience to get their reactions - the programme I usually use when I mention this point is Series 7 of Red Dwarf which was filmed and then shown to an audience, unlike the rest of the series (except 'Back to Earth' which was filmed and shown without studio laughter); also there's one episode in Series 1 that has a woman with a very annoying laugh where I wish they actually did use canned laughter....

It was US sitcoms that I was making the point, which again I read in a book while looking at something else while at University which is why I can't cite my source, that the canned laughter is exactly that - a recording that is played out at moments, often to enhance the studio laughter or to increase the effect of a 'joke'.

It's interesting to hear about programmes like BBT, but I suppose with a cult following, that sort of thing is bound to be common. I'd guess that the textbook I saw that nugget in was out of date!

I've heard that some professors in Munich and other big universities expect your work in English but that's not a general rule. And those professors might just be mad because the bias international rankings just don't work for Germany (we have very little third party financing and most of our research is done in institutes like the Max Plank Institut or the Frauenhofer Institute instead of universities) and they want to get some bonus points by making their students write everything that might see the outside world (Bachelor / Master thesis and dissertations) in English.

I'm not even sure where I read it. Probably some shitty blog. I just thought that if you Brits don't care about that, others probably won't care either and the author of said blog or forum post or whatever just wants to go against the mainstream.

In terms of education, more and more countries become more popular for English teachers. Either immigrants or local teachers with Master's of Education.

My English text book was still written in British English. The English course I had to take at uni was also British English even though I study Computer Science. A subject where the US is certainly right at the top.

You might learn a more American accent these days simply because teachers now spent time in / come from other Anglophone countries than the UK.

The website of my state doesn't indicate any rules concerning the dialect primarily taught in school but every core curriculum keeps the definition of ""goals"" of the classes quite broad. So, it doesn't say ""After grade X, the pupil is supposed to be able to go shopping in the UK"" but rather ""in an Anglophone country"" so I suppose it's then up to the schools. But one of our biggest text book publishers for schools still has the intercultural part of the book focused on the UK.

Education is a matter for the state, though, so that only counts for NRW.

But honestly, I've got no idea why anybody would teach Germans American English. Other Europeans don't care, everybody but Americans still write like you guys and chances are way higher that a German will work with a British company or even emigrate to the UK (at least as long as you stay in the EU) than the US.",null,0,null,1420907002,null,0,false,0,cnkkf8v,null,t3_2ryu3a,null,t1_cnkkf8v,null,t1_cnkjgp3,null,null,null,1424953533,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

How is it a game?!

&gt;There is a clear difference between the groups you mentioned and the islamic militants.

Well Islamic militants have a different religion, so there's that. 

&gt; so much in the fact that islamic militants don't really have much to achieve with what they are doing, but are doing it anyway

Osama Bin Laden's fatwahs against the US were about US withdrawal from the Middle East (especially holy sites) and support for Israel.  Britain and Spain were attacked for supporting the US in the Iraq war.  The attack on Charlie Hebdo was obviously about the cartoons.  I'm not saying their aims are right, but that doesn't mean they don't have any.

&gt;They are trying to please a deity and have a clear lack of conscience.

Again, see history.  I hate to break it to you, but lack of conscience may not be a new thing.  Pleasing deities also crops up from time to time as a motivation.

&gt;The trouble is discussion isn't your agenda. You disagree that there is an issue with islam. What is there to discuss past that point? I disagree with you.

Right, so when you criticised me for closing down discussion, what you meant to criticise me for was disagreeing with you!  Shame on me for daring to do such a thing!  

&gt;I think you're an idiot.

The trouble is, I have facts and a reasoned argument on my side.  The most substantive thing you've pinned on me is that I don't agree with you.   In this you are at least correct.

Probably my favourite place in the whole of the UK. Stunning coastal walks nearby, some decent larger towns nearby and several good sized cities beyond that. 


Also add that it's in the middle of the Yorkshire Moors which is in itself beautiful makes it probably one of the best options to visit as there's plenty to look at and there are many small little towns nearby to keep you busy on days out. 


Plenty of places to stay in the town itself and enjoy the quaint charm of the town as well as plenty of holiday cottages in the surrounding areas.

It could be improved, but the point is that almost all the reforms people suggest take us closer to bureaucratic legislative deadlock and further away from technocracy, not closer. Additionally, peers can, as of a Private Members' Bill passed last year, properly resign/retire.

Quite simply, the Lords often get right (in my opinion) what the Commons do not, and it is regularly overlooked. For example, they blocked a Bill that limits access to judicial review, they and blocked cuts to legal aid for a long time too.

Party politics is also less dominant in the Lords than the Commons (by far). Electing the Lords would remove this. As I said previously, they are also the most effective (and sometimes only effective) check on government power.

the movement of jove and aguero together in the middle could have stretched jagielka and stones, two centerbacks that weren't in the best of form in dealing with fancy footwork today. jove wasn't at his best i'll admit, but aguero would have taken a lot of pressure off of him to work more in the middle. aguero is back in his first game for over a month, you cannot just hang him up front when he is already a questionable stand alone striker (dude works best when he has another ST, just like Jove)

Nasri wasn't good today i'll admit. i was fine with him being taken off but i would have liked it to be earlier if at all. his movement was good but some of his touches were off. 

overall though i feel that pelle does not give enough time to the subs to work. this is the second time i have now seen kolly come in with a minute or so left in the game for nasri, he doesn't look to happy and neither does nasri so it really doesn't help, especially when kolly is in terrible form.

And what's the end game? What is the ultimate goal of this campaign? Do you know it? Please share it.

&gt; Again, see history. I hate to break it to you, but lack of conscience may not be a new thing. 

You know, after mentioning Nanking previously, I just think you're incredibly stupid for assuming I didn't know that.

It's not the fact that you disagree with me. In fact, I never said we faced more danger in this country than we ever have previously, though I am saying it is a vastly different kind of danger. You on the other hand, seem to think that because we are safer as a society, it's unfair to take a harder line because it's somehow ""unnecessary"". I never disagreed with the facts you presented about other groups, but what I am saying is that they are incredibly different groups with different agendas to this specific one. 

I can only assume that want to sit and play a bongo drum in your living room, hoping this will all pass over. No need to talk about action...it's all taken care of!

In a social context I totally agree. The chances of bumping into a Christian on the street who thinks you need to stone prostitutes is incredibly slim, so one shouldn’t behave as though that’s representative of the religion or its followers.

In a lawmaking context, though, all religion has to be considered in terms of the extremists in all religions. To pass a law, for example, that bans mocking religious deities would be a hugely bad idea as it will be disproportionately abused by those who want to silence criticism.

&gt; I'd even go so far as to blame the people that taught the terrorists their interpretation of the Quran more than the terrorists themselves

Mangala was also playing too risky again, we're lucky the ref didn't give a penalty when he dragged that Everton player down during the corner.

Silva and Nasri did well to produce chances though, and let's not forget Zabaleta and his perfect tackle that led to our goal. Hart made a good save, but I can only wonder why he jumped out like that to give Everton that goal.

Lastly, I dearly hope Bony and the return of Kompany can give us what we need during corners, we're not dangerous at all on that front, in fact it's a good opportunity for the opposition to get a counter-attack. So many of them and yet nothing threatening in the slightest, it's a big problem.

I don't get the distinction.  If you launch a fatwah against America for US withdrawal from the Middle East and support for Israel, then surely the endgame is US withdrawal from the Middle East and ending support for Israel?!

&gt;You know, after just mentioning Nanking previously, I just think you're incredibly stupid for assuming I didn't know that.

I don't think you're incredibly stupid for not knowing that - that would just be ignorance, not stupidity.  If you weren't completely ignorant, listing ""they have no conscience"" or ""they want to please their deity"" in your list of things that makes Islamism unique among committers of atrocities would require an absurd lack of application of thought though.  How could you think that would make a convincing argument to anyone?!

&gt;You on the other hand, seem to think that because we are safer as a society, it's unfair to take a harder line because it's somehow ""unnecessary"".

I said what now?  I don't remember saying any of this! Who are you quoting when you put quote marks around the word ""unnecessary""?! A harder line on what?  Terrorism or Islam?  What are you talking about?  Why on Earth would I not want to take a hard line against terrorism?!  Did I fall asleep and call for the legalisation of terrorism or something?

Which I don't think is legally the case either, or at least it shouldn't be given the number of drunk people walking around, holding conversations, and even committing crimes they will not remember tomorrow.

Regardless of this, or indeed whether the boy was guilty of anything or not, I think the teacher was negligent.

Yes.

Would you hold Bristol Council accountable for the actions of say, Leeds?

&gt;I agree that there's a distinct difference between the structures of Catholicism and Islam, however I do believe the most vocal and prominent, although not given power by any hierarchy beyond a local one, should be accountable of the actions they sanction.

Yes, I agree. But who should be held responsible? Who should be accountable? Because very few Muslims in the UK have any connection to this event. No more than you do. The same can be send for 99% of Muslims. 

&gt;To simply argue that because Islam lacks a hierarchy is removing any responsibility key figures should naturally have and in my opinion, delegitimises it's standing as a global faith.

Yes, because to touch on the Christianity angle again; you wouldn't hold anyone belonging to the CoE accountable for the actions of Catholics. The exact same logic can be applied here. Islam lacks structure, so to say you're Muslim does not put you into a ""category"" of accountability. Believing in something does not make you anymore accountable than someone else for the actions of a small group of people who happen to believe the same as you.

Edit: Just read your reply below - I see what you're saying. But I'd say it's still different. Catholicism can be held accountable, because the pope caims responsibility for the entire Faith. Akin to a President/Prime Minister. Muslims have no such leader, so by that fact alone there isn't as much accountability because Islam is more of a ""DIY Faith"" in that, there's no strict rules and those rules are by and large dictated by either your personal religious practices or your mosque leader.",null,0,null,1420910589,null,0,1420911213,0,cnkm33m,null,t3_2ryao2,null,t1_cnkm33m,null,t1_cnkgead,null,null,null,1424952757,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So that's a 15 year delay before this surge in medical students will translate to consultants in the most difficult fields.


Not to mention the problems a surge in medical students would cause, the cost is one I've already mentioned but teaching hospitals are exceptionally busy and frankly don't have the capacity or time to teach even more medical students during their clinical years.

Defense was great - one crap goal, but so much more composed in the box, less panic.  But Jags, my man - what was that hip thing?  Basically handed it to them there.

We've even managed to get a little bit further away from the relegation zone, albeit by one point, thanks to Wigan and Millwall losing, but we're still in peril, dangling a mere two points above the drop.

That's what feels galling about letting the lead slip. Although it sounded like Morison had a decent game, bullying Bolton's centre halves and winning his fair share of headers, he had a gilt-edged chance that was saved by Lonergan and could have scored another from the chances we had. Byram and Murphy had good opportunities, too. We really need another target man to give us an alternative to the toothless Morison. It's a decent point, and we almost lost that as well, but it could have been so much more.

The 4-2-3-1 formation seems to be working well though, despite the team initially looking like it had been picked via raffle. I think we created more chances in this match than we made in the Fulham, Wigan, and Derby games combined! Byram was a constant threat and Berardi seemed more comfortable and played one of his best games for the club, while Murphy and Austin seem to be better suited to this system. Taylor seems to be staking a claim as a good back-up to Warnock as well, he stopped two certain goals from hitting the back of the net today.

The only negatives were Cook having a poor game by his high standards, despite a good first few minutes, Sloth being relatively anonymous and sounding a yard off the pace, although he wasn't on his preferred side, to be fair, and I guess he was the most solid option to be in front of young Taylor. However, most concerning was Bellusci, who was lucky to be on the pitch after elbowing Heskey and having a confrontation with Morison broken up by Austin. Stupid decisions like that make me question his future at the club.

So in summary, a decent result, and hopefully we can do something with two home games coming up, albeit against some tough opposition.",null,0,null,1420911466,null,0,false,0,cnkmi9t,null,t3_2rz4qv,null,t1_cnkmi9t,null,t3_2rz4qv,null,null,null,1424952559,null,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4,null

A script could do this for thousands of people a minute. 

I would actually approve of this system if they had set it up. It would save hundreds of millions of tax payer money and also be easily fooled by applying for jobs know you're not going to get. 

People will complain about job losses. But they also complain about massive DWP expenditures on thousands of staff they don't need if they can automate the system. It will happen eventually, just like automation has hit many other industries.

Clark and Guzan played very well today. In the beginning of the game, the passing and movement up front was a bit better.

I'm not saying that we deserve an excuse, but Leicester did play quite well today.

Negatives:

Everything else, to be honest. We can't form a decent attack. The defending, which has been the cornerstone of this team so far, was very poor. Grealish was not even in the squad today. Lambert's possession tactics is not working without a decent attacking midfielder. If we don't buy appropriate talent in this window then we're in some trouble.

He is shit, he isnt even that good in the air, he just is a cunt to defenders climbing, tugging and pushing them just because they are far better footballers than him, todays example Fernandez. His scoring record is shite, and when liverpool signed him for 35 million, i'll write that again, 35 million, he flopped and wasnt worth even 1 million. Then to top it off, he went for 15 million to west ham. Let us bear in mind that bony cost 12 million pound who is 5x the player Carroll is even if he had both his legs amputated. Not sure if I've said this but I hate Carroll with a passion. 

Rant over. Also have just realised that much of this rant may have been over-exaggerated, but you get the point from the rant. All in all I hate Carroll and the way he makes teams play.

Mustafa Mashhur, General Guide, Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt; Qazi Hussain Ahmed, Ameer, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, Pakistan; Muti Rahman Nizami, Ameer, Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, Bangladesh; Shaykh Ahmad Yassin, Founder, Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Palestine; Rashid Ghannoushi, President, Nahda Renaissance Movement, Tunisia; Fazil Nour, President, PAS – Parti Islam SeMalaysia, Malaysia; and 40 other Muslim scholars and politicians:
**“The undersigned, leaders of Islamic movements, are horrified by the events of Tuesday 11 September 2001 in the United States which resulted in massive killing, destruction and attack on innocent lives. We express our deepest sympathies and sorrow. We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents, which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents. God Almighty says in the Holy Qur’an: ‘No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another’** (Surah al-Isra 17:15).”

Shaykh Yusuf Qaradawi, Qatar; Tariq Bishri, Egypt; Muhammad S. Awwa, Egypt; Fahmi Huwaydi, Egypt; Haytham Khayyat, Syria; Shaykh Taha Jabir al-Alwani, U.S.:
**“All Muslims ought to be united against all those who terrorize the innocents, and those who permit the killing of non-combatants without a justifiable reason. Islam has declared the spilling of blood and the destruction of property as absolute prohibitions until the Day of Judgment. … [It is] necessary to apprehend the true perpetrators of these crimes, as well as those who aid and abet them through incitement, financing or other support. They must be brought to justice in an impartial court of law and [punished] appropriately. … [It is] a duty of Muslims to participate in this effort with all possible means.”**
Statement of September 27, 2001.

Shaykh Muhammed Sayyid al-Tantawi, imam of al-Azhar mosque in Cairo, Egypt:
**“Attacking innocent people is not courageous, it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgement. … It’s not courageous to attack innocent children, women and civilians. It is courageous to protect freedom, it is courageous to defend oneself and not to attack.”**
Agence France Presse, September 14, 2001

Abdel-Mo’tei Bayyoumi, al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy, Cairo, Egypt:
**“There is no terrorism or a threat to civilians in jihad [religious struggle].”**
Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 20 – 26 September 2001 (via archive.org).

Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition Islamist group in Egypt, said it was “horrified” by the attack and expressed “condolences and sadness”:
**“[We] strongly condemn such activities that are against all humanist and Islamic morals. … [We] condemn and oppose all aggression on human life, freedom and dignity anywhere in the world.”**
Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 13 – 19 September 2001 (via archive.org).

Shaykh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the Hizbullah movement in Lebanon, said he was “horrified” by these “barbaric … crimes”:
**“Beside the fact that they are forbidden by Islam, these acts do not serve those who carried them out but their victims, who will reap the sympathy of the whole world. … Islamists who live according to the human values of Islam could not commit such crimes.”**
Agence France Presse, September 14, 2001

‘Abdulaziz bin ‘Abdallah Al-Ashaykh, chief mufti of Saudi Arabia:
**“Firstly: the recent developments in the United States including hijacking planes, terrorizing innocent people and shedding blood, constitute a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by Islam, which views them as gross crimes and sinful acts. Secondly: any Muslim who is aware of the teachings of his religion and who adheres to the directives of the Holy Qur’an and the sunnah (the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad) will never involve himself in such acts, because they will invoke the anger of God Almighty and lead to harm and corruption on earth.”**
Statement of September 15, 2001 (via archive.org).

‘Abdulaziz bin ‘Abdallah Al-Ashaykh, chief mufti of Saudi Arabia:
**“You must know Islam’s firm position against all these terrible crimes. The world must know that Islam is a religion of peace and mercy and goodness; it is a religion of justice and guidance…Islam has forbidden violence in all its forms. It forbids the hijacking airplanes, ships and other means of transport, and it forbids all acts that undermine the security of the innocent.”**

**“As a human community we must be vigilant and careful to oppose these pernicious and shameless evils, which are not justified by any sane logic, nor by the religion of Islam.”**

Shaikh Saleh Al-Luheidan, Chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council, Saudi Arabia:
**“And I repeat once again: that this act that the United states was afflicted with, with this vulgarity and barbarism, and which is even more barbaric than terrorist acts, I say that these acts are from the depths of depravity and the worst of evils.”**
Televised statement of September 2001, in Muhammad ibn Hussin Al-Qahtani, editor, The Position of Saudi Muslim Scholars Regarding Terrorism in the Name of Islam (Saudi Arabia, 2004), pages 27-28.

Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdallah al-Sabil, member of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars, Saudi Arabia:
**“Any attack on innocent people is unlawful and contrary to shari’a (Islamic law). … Muslims must safeguard the lives, honor and property of Christians and Jews. Attacking them contradicts shari’a.”**
Agence France Presse, December 4, 2001

Council of Saudi ‘Ulama, fatwa of February 2003:
**“What is happening in some countries from the shedding of the innocent blood and the bombing of buildings and ships and the destruction of public and private installations is a criminal act against Islam. … Those who carry out such acts have the deviant beliefs and misleading ideologies and are responsible for the crime. Islam and Muslims should not be held responsible for such actions.”**
The Dawn newspaper, Karachi, Pakistan, February 8, 2003 (via archive.org); also in “Public Statements by Senior Saudi Officials Condemning Extremism and Promoting Moderation,” May 2004, page 10 (via archive.org).

Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, chairman of the Sunna and Sira Council, Qatar:
**“Our hearts bleed for the attacks that has targeted the World Trade Center [WTC], as well as other institutions in the United States despite our strong oppositions to the American biased policy towards Israel on the military, political and economic fronts. Islam, the religion of tolerance, holds the human soul in high esteem, and considers the attack against innocent human beings a grave sin, this is backed by the Qur’anic verse which reads: ‘Who so ever kills a human being [as punishment] for [crimes] other than manslaughter or [sowing] corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and who so ever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind’ (Al-Ma’idah:32).”**

Hamza Yusuf, American Muslim leader:
**“Religious zealots of any creed are defeated people who lash out in desperation, and they often do horrific things. And if these people [who committed murder on September 11] indeed are Arabs, Muslims, they’re obviously very sick people and I can’t even look at it in religious terms. It’s politics, tragic politics. There’s no Islamic justification for any of it. … You can’t kill innocent people. There’s no Islamic declaration of war against the United States. I think every Muslim country except Afghanistan has an embassy in this country. And in Islam, a country where you have embassies is not considered a belligerent country. In Islam, the only wars that are permitted are between armies and they should engage on battlefields and engage nobly. The Prophet Muhammad said, “Do not kill women or children or non-combatants and do not kill old people or religious people,” and he mentioned priests, nuns and rabbis. And he said, “Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees and do not poison the wells of your enemies.” The Hadith, the sayings of the Prophet, say that no one can punish with fire except the lord of fire. It’s prohibited to burn anyone in Islam as a punishment. No one can grant these attackers any legitimacy. It was evil.”**
San Jose Mercury News, September 15, 2001 (via archive.org).

Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), prominent British Muslim:
**“I wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action: the Qur’an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims at this sorrowful moment.”
[On singing an a cappella version of ""Peace Train"" for the Concert for New York City:] “After the tragedy, my heart was heavy with sadness and shock, and I was determined to help in some way. Organizers asked me to take part in a message for tolerance and sing ‘Peace Train.’ Of course, I agreed. … As a Muslim from the West, it is important to me to let people know that these acts of mass murder have nothing to do with Islam and the beliefs of Muslims.”**

Abdulaziz Sachedina, professor of religious studies, University of Virginia:
**“New York was grieving. Sorrow covered the horizons. The pain of separation and of missing family members, neighbors, citizens, humans could be felt in every corner of the country. That day was my personal day of “jihad” (“struggle”) — jihad with my pride and my identity as a Muslim. This is the true meaning of jihad — “struggle with one’s own ego and false pride.” I don’t ever recall that I had prayed so earnestly to God to spare attribution of such madness that was unleashed upon New York and Washington to the Muslims. I felt the pain and, perhaps for the first time in my entire life, I felt embarrassed at the thought that it could very well be my fellow Muslims who had committed this horrendous act of terrorism. How could these terrorists invoke God’s mercifulness and compassion when they had, through their evil act, put to shame the entire history of this great religion and its culture of toleration?”**
“Where Was God on September 11?” (via archive.org).

Ali Khan, professor of law, Washburn University School of Law, Topeka, Kansas:
**“To the most learned in the text of the Quran, these verses must be read in the context of many other verses that stipulate the Islamic law of war—a war that the Islamic leader must declare after due consultation with advisers. For the less learned, however, these verses may provide the motivation and even the plot for a merciless strike against a self-chosen enemy.”**
“Attack on America: An Islamic Perspective,” September 17, 2001.

Muqtedar Khan, then an assistant professor of political science, Adrian College, Michigan:
**“What happened on September 11th in New York and Washington DC will forever remain a horrible scar on the history of Islam and humanity. No matter how much we condemn it, and point to the Quran and the Sunnah to argue that Islam forbids the killing of innocent people, the fact remains that the perpetrators of this crime against humanity have indicated that their actions are sanctioned by Islamic values. The fact that even now several Muslim scholars and thousands of Muslims defend the accused is indicative that not all Muslims believe that the attacks are unIslamic. This is truly sad. … If anywhere in your hearts there is any sympathy or understanding with those who committed this act, I invite you to ask yourself this question, would Muhammad (pbuh) sanction such an act? While encouraging Muslims to struggle against injustice (Al Quran 4:135), Allah also imposes strict rules of engagement. He says in unequivocal terms that to kill an innocent being is like killing entire humanity (Al Quran 5:32). He also encourages Muslims to forgive Jews and Christians if they have committed injustices against us (Al Quran 2:109, 3:159, 5:85).”**
“A Memo to American Muslims,” October 5, 2001.

Dr. Alaa Al-Yousuf, Bahraini economist and political activist:
**“On Friday, 14 September [the first Friday prayers after 11 September], almost the whole world expressed its condemnation of the crime and its grief for the bereaved families of the victims. Those who abstained or, even worse, rejoiced, will have joined the terrorists, not in the murder, but in adding to the incalculable damage on the other victims of the atrocity, namely, Islam as a faith, Muslims and Arabs as peoples, and possibly the Palestinian cause. The terrorists and their apologists managed to sully Islam as a faith both in the eyes of many Muslims and non-Muslims alike.”**

League of Arab States:
**“The General-Secretariat of the League of Arab States shares with the people and government of the United States of America the feelings of revulsion, horror and shock over the terrorist attacks that ripped through the World Trade Centre and Pentagon, inflicting heavy damage and killing and wounding thousands of many nationalities. These terrorist crimes have been viewed by the League as inadmissible and deserving all condemnation. Divergence of views between the Arabs and the United States over the latter’s foreign policy on the Middle East crisis does in no way adversely affect the common Arab attitude of compassion with the people and government of the United States at such moments of facing the menace and ruthlessness of international terrorism. In more than one statement released since the horrendous attacks, the League has also expressed deep sympathy with the families of the victims. In remarks to newsmen immediately following the tragic events, Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa described the feelings of the Arab world as demonstrably sympathetic with the American people, particularly with families and individuals who lost their loved ones. “It is indeed tormenting that any country or people or city anywhere in the world be the scene of such disastrous attacks,” he added. While convinced that it is both inconceivable and lamentable that such a large-scale, organised terrorist campaign take place anywhere, anytime, the League believes that the dreadful attacks against WTC and the Pentagon unveil, time and again, that the cancer of terrorism can be extensively damaging if left unchecked. It follows that there is a pressing and urgent need to combat world terrorism. In this context, an earlier call by [Egyptian] President Hosni Mubarak for convening an international conference to draw up universal accord on ways and means to eradicate this phenomenon and demonstrate international solidarity is worthy of active consideration. The Arabs have walked a large distance in the fight against cross-border terrorism by concluding in April 1998 the Arab Agreement on Combating Terrorism.”**

This is not actually what I said, and I think a careful reader would have noticed my deliberate desire not to do so. It is obvious that Islam and Christianity are compatible with democracy to some extent: Europe has many countries that have been or are Christian and democratic, and Indonesia has just had a successful election and is largely Muslim.

My point is strong belief in an Abrahamic god is likely to coincide with illiberal views on sex, women and free speech.

Technically he is a UK citizen. His extradition was delayed so the ECtHR could get evidence on what his imprisonment would be like, both pre- and post-trial.

Abu Qatada was the guy who was (eventually) deported to Jordan (i.e. the UK Government wanted to get rid of him), where he was acquitted of the offences he had previously been tried and convicted of. His deportation was delayed several times, with the UK Government repeatedly losing their case, on the grounds that he wouldn't get a fair trial due to the possible use of evidence obtained through torture.

The differences are subtle, but can be kind of important. One guy is an evil, convicted terrorist who was extradited to the US following due process. The other is (in theory) an innocent man who just wanted to make sure he got a fair trial, but who the UK government would rather lock up indefinitely without charge (first) and then deport to somewhere that tortured people.

As for May wanting to get rid of the HRA; it isn't just cases like these. May (and some of her colleagues) seem to keep losing cases on human rights grounds.

Neither Dembele nor Stambouli have that ability. And, I'd argue that Bentaleb is more stabilizing of the defense, providing a better screen and outlet than Stambouli. Mason contributes more to a flowing attack, often making these bursting runs into space that help us outnumber the defenders at key points. Sometimes those are spectacular and right into the 18-yard box, but just as often they're in the middle of the pitch and they create space for the rest of the attackers to get the ball forward.

We have a fairly kind run of fixtures this month, but I think we'll struggle without Mason and Bentaleb.

null,false,georgehale,DK,denmark,null,"The following is copy-and-pasted verbatim from a Chelsea forum, in which former Chelsea youth player Sam Tillen – who now plays his football in Iceland – writes candidly about his experiences as having John Terry as his club captain during his formative years.

I’ve no idea when it dates from, but the article has been translated directly from Icelandic so it may not scan properly in places. That said, it’s perfectly legible and presents Terry in a rarely acknowledged light. It may just add another dimension to your monochrome view of a man so often vilified by all and sundry (hands up, Pies have been as guilty as anyone else on that front on occasion)…

As football fans, we don’t get a lot of opportunities to judge a player’s persona, all we get is stuff from the newspaper and other medias and of course how the player acts on the football pitch. It’s normal that our feelings towards them are based on those things, since we don’t know them personally. But unfortunately this can be very deceiving.

Sometimes reporters can have a lot of propaganda. They could have had an argument with the player, be friends with his ex-wife or support a rival club. When a player steps on the field on a Saturday the whole world watches him play under the pressure of his life. Players, managers and supporters have all been waiting for this moment – kick off.

It’s abnormal to judge people’s behaviour under these circumstances. Do you think that when Gary Neville wins a game of hide and seek with his daughter he yells at his wife “Come on!!!!” while he holds on to his shirt like he did in front of Liverpool supporters at Old Trafford? I think not.

When you are around the training ground you get to see the players in their true form. Some of them surprise and charm you while others dissappoint you. This would also be the case if you meet someone in real life. The fact that footballers are famous does not make them any different. They just have talent in a specific field just like doctors or architects. Some of them are good people, others are not.

The year 2002, I was 17 and had been injured for eight months. I usually had to train twice as much to be in form. I trained with several players during rehabilation and since John Terry was facing injury as well I trained a lot with him. We trained together for three or four weeks before he began to play again and prove himself as the number one center-back in the first team.

After this, John always observed how I was doing with my injury and he wished me good luck for my first game after 11 months of rehabilation. Unfortunately in that first game I got heavily injured again and had to go to surgery three days later. When the physio came to visit me he said that ‘JT’ had asked if I could get vacation and he even asked Graeme (Le Saux) if they could use the ‘discipline fund’ (money collected if a player comes to training late and such) from the first team to pay for my vacation. I couldn’t believe it.

After staying home for ten days, I went to the training ground and John was there. He asked how I was doing and then said “Me and Graeme have arranged for you to go to a vacation, you can go wherever you want, with your friend or your brother, you deserve something good. Just think about where you want to go, this isn’t your money! Just let us know how much it costs and we will arrange it.

I didn’t know what to say other than ‘thank you’. I talked to the youth and reserve coaches and they told me it was probably best for me to take the vacation. One of the reserve coaches said that I still had that ‘hospital color’ because I was as white as a ghost. I lost a lot of blood in the surgery and it showed in my face.

My mother had also just had surgery so she could use a a little break from work. That’s why I wanted to take her with me. It was October so I needed to find ‘some place hot’ like John advised me to do.

The one place close that was hot enough was Southern Spain and because this wasn’t my money I didn’t want to take advantage of the generosity from John. So, the next day during practice I said to John “Is it okay if me and my mother go to Sevilla over the weekend?”

His answer was, “Come on Tills! You can go wherever you want for free, why do you want to go there? It won’t even be hot. Look at it again, go to the Caribbean or something, you can sit at the beach without having to worry how much it is going to cost, we will make sure of it.”

So I went and checked again and found a good offer for a trip to Tobago. I talked to my physio for a few days and he said “It’s fine, just talk to JT.” I still felt for bad spending other people’s money, I had never done that before. So naturally I was a little nervous when I was talking to John, telling him about the trip I had in mind.

And what did John say? “No problem, good choice! Just give me the info and we’ll pay it.” He arranged everything and the day before I was leaving for the trip he called me over in the dressing room. “Tills, your going tomorrow, right?” He went to his pocket and took out £100. “Here, some pocket money to spend”. I said that I couldn’t accept it. He asked again and again I refused. Then he stood up and said “you’re not going anywhere until you accept this!”. I had no choice.

When I came back from the trip, I was renewed and a large part of the reason was that I was finally ready to play football again, 6 months after my surgery.

In my first game after the injury (in the youth team) we were playing Crystal Palace at our training ground. The first team wasn’t suppose to have training until 3pm but our game was at 10am. John came to see me play, 5 hours before his training. He came just to see if I would get through the game, which happened. He certainly didn’t have to do that, but he did.

When by brother Joe was in the youth team, John paid for driving lessons for every single player in the youth team because he knew how expensive it was when you only get £80-a-week in wages. The youth players just had to tell him how much it cost and John paid it the next day.

At that time, when the youth players were cleaning the first team players’ boots, everyone wanted to get one of the ‘sharks’ – John, Frank Lampard, Jody Morris, etc – because they gave the highest christmas bonuses. Some players didn’t give any bonuses even though the youth players had cleaned they’re boots for six months.

John didn’t only give high bonuses, but he even paid for the youth players fines if he thought they were being treated unfairly. Of course, he told them not to tell a soul.

John has never forgotten what it was like to be a player in the youth team and he is the perfect captain. He was always available if you wanted to talk to him. He always asked every youth player how they were doing in the team. If he heard that you played well in a match, he congratulated and encouraged you. He really had an interest. He never forgot the young players.

He was always monitored the youth players, including me. For instance, he found an agent for me that I signed with. When youth players traveled with the first team he always made sure that they got their bonuses, that made a lot of difference in their paychecks.

He helped them adapt and welcomed them into a new environment. On the pitch and the training ground he was magnificent, he had an heart like a lion. He trained after practices, always did that little extra. We really looked up to him.

It wasn’t just the youth players either. There are endless stories of his kindness and generosity, stories that never left the training ground. One of them stands out: We had an old masseuse called Al. One day his car broke down for good. He said that he couldn’t attend training sessions anymore because it was very difficult for a man of his age to use public transport.

One day after practice, John told him to go to the parking lot and close his eyes. When he opened them he saw a brand new car. John had asked every player in the first team to chip in to buy Al a new car. The old man started to cry. This all happened before Roman Abramovich and before John was a superstar and started making big money.

Last year Al got seriously sick and had to be in a hospital. When John found out, he immediately contacted him. Al was flattered to hear from him, and his wife was delighted that John had taken the time to think about him. John visited Al regularly until he passed away and John, of course, attended his funeral.

Marcel Desailly – the Chelsea captain before him – didn’t do anything like the things John did. He couldn’t care less about the young players or anyone else in the club for that matter.

As a player he was impeccable, but as a captain he did nothing and wasn’t even close to what John is. In my first and second year in the youth team it was our job to get signed shirts from players from the first team, those shirts where then sent to fans or to a charity.

We all stood in a row in the hallway before practices when the first team players walked passed us and then they signed the shirts. When Mr. Desailly came, he usually pretended to be on the phone so he didn’t have to do anything. We were like “Marcel, uuuuuumm, Marcel, could you please…..” and then he was gone. Disappointment.

Some players cause you a lot of disappointment when you meet them personally. They also do that in daily life. John has, of course, had a few problems off the pitch that have gotten a lot of press, but I will always remember how he treated me when I was a teenager.

No one else would have done that or even thought about doing it. He is no saint, but there is a reason why Chelsea fans, players and staff look at John Terry as a real leader.”

Cockle warming. Take from that what you will. I’m sure it won’t go along way to adding any perspective or depth to the vast majority of people’s opinion of the man, but it’s certainly refreshing to hear Terry’s name mentioned in a positive context once in a blue moon.",null,0,null,1420915025,null,0,false,0,cnkoasn,null,t3_2rypqb,null,t1_cnkoasn,null,t3_2rypqb,null,null,null,1424951724,null,26,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,26,null

null,false,ScheduledRelapse,null,null,null,"&gt;A technocracy was initially a form of organizational structure or system of governance where decision-makers were selected on the basis of technological knowledge. Technocrats, a term used frequently by journalists in the twenty-first century, can refer to individuals exercising governmental authority because of their knowledge.[1] The concept of a technocracy remains mostly hypothetical, though some nations[which?] have been considered as such in the sense of being governed primarily by technical experts in various fields of governmental decision-making. Technocrat has come to mean either ""a member of a powerful technical elite"" or ""someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts"".[2][3][4] Examples include scientists, engineers, and technologists who have special knowledge, expertise, or skills, and would compose the governing body, instead of people elected through political parties and businesspeople. 

To be a Technocracy the House of Lords would have to be made up of scientists, and engineers not business people and ex-politicians. How many scientists and engineers sit in the House of Lords again?

Here is a quote from a Baroness that sits on the Digital Skills Committee in the House of Lords.

Positives: Lukaku is playing up to his potential. He has always been a terror going full speed but now with the big improvement to his hold up play he is playing like a completely different striker. Hopefully shutting up some critics moaning about his price tag. Coleman, Besic and Naismith's work rate was superb showing the team has not given up and are starting to believe in their own game. Martinez seems to be more willing to make some adjustments. Stones playing the full 90 and immediately our defense limits the terrible turnovers. 

Cons: While he played better, Barry is still looking slow. Jagielka was our worst defender. Ill give him more time to settle with Stones but we may need to look for another starter for next season and not for a #3. Besic was also a little sloppy with the ball. II don't mind him losing the ball by being aggressive but some of his passes were right to city or completely off the mark. Barkley also did not seem to have the impact on the game that he wanted, however in fairness to him Fernandinho and Fernando are both two good DMs and the were focused on doubling him and not letting him get space.

Because I pointed out what some would say is factual error in your assertion? 

Well you appear to be a fan of the fringes of opinions. You could just ask me why I think what I commented, rather than assume I take some sort of batshit extreme position. It generally helps, I think, to consider that if you think someone's position or opinion is ridiculous then there's a good chance you made some assumptions and/or don't understand or know what they actually think. Not always, but quite often. Works for issues in the general media too.

Rather than explain my position, I'll instead invite you to tell me why you think the general public have some odd ideas about what counts as rape. You don't have to of course, and I'm not being condescending. For starters it makes me do what I've described above: to find out why you think something that, on the surface from over here, seems somewhat arseaboutface.

For the record the question I asked wasn't rhetorical: I saw more than one person make that point and suddenly realised I didn't know where it came from.

If they ask -tell them the truth about why you can't do the job and provide a medical note from your doctor.

If you're lucky you'll get a nice person who will sympathise with you (these are usually the ones that look like they want to kill themselves because they know by sympathising with you they're actually not doing their job - which is to get you off benefits).

If you're not lucky you'll meet one of the usual jobsworths, who will make life difficult for you just by ""following orders"". You've got to remember you're just a statistic to these people, and you were about to be one less claimant, and now you're being awkward.  

It's important to remember that if they do piss you about and cancel your JSA at first, you'll definitely win this if you can have your doctor confirm your medical conditions, they're treading on dangerous ground challenging people with mental health issues, and they'll just give you your money to shut you up if you kick up enough fuss. 

I'd recommend recording the appointment on your phone if you can do that, I don't remotely trust anyone at the JobCentre, not only because some of the horror stories online, but also because I've personally been told everything was fine and I'd get my payments as usual, then a few weeks later still not had money because someone had put my payments ""on hold"" (the head office couldn't even give me a reason why, they just released the payments that day).


It's depressing that the only reason you will be fine here is because you suffer medical conditions that you can prove. You'd think people would have a right decline a job if they found out it was something horrible that they didn't like, but JSA would expect you to do it.

Top comments on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2qjavy/hamas_we_will_liberate_palestine_jerusalem/) thread from a couple of weeks ago include 

- And if anybody thinks Hamas leaders have the Palestinian people's best interests in mind, they are fucking delusional.

- It's not like they hide their genocidal intentions, they just think we're too stupid to notice.

- Translation: ""We will get many civilians killed and will accomplish nothing.""

- Hamas is just a bunch of thugs... corrupt thugs to be more precise

And there's nothing pro-Hamas at all. 

&gt; my understanding that they hate Jews more

Really don't think so. A comparable comments section would be [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2e6ldj/israelgaza_conflict_antisemitic_incidents_up_500/) on an article entitled ""Anti-Semitic incidents 'up 500%' in UK since start of bombardment of Gaza"" where the comments with positive votes include 

- when you take it to the next level and deliberately attack Jews, Jewish places of worship, and/or segregate Jews, in general, then you are a fucking racist and the scourge of society. (+141)

- Yep and most of those trashing shops in the UK are Muslims (+138) 

- The more antisemitic Europe becomes, the more Jews flee to Israel, the stronger the Jewish support (and support in general) of Zionism will become. (+48)

While comments similar to the ones which got *upvoted* when said about Muslims, here get downvoted, for example

Yes, a bomb drill. As if being at the jobcentre isn't embarrassing enough in our 'benefit street' /Sun/Daily Mail ""scroungers"" age. 

They sounded alarms through the jobcentre while we were all trying to sign on, they then ushered everyone out the back of the jobcentre and around the building, guiding us along like we were primary school kids on a day out, they take us around the whole building round to the front, why the fuck we didn't go out the front door first I don't know, maybe the invisible bomb was blocking the way.

We were left to stand outside the front of the centre next to a busy main road on a miserable day for 10 minutes, while they followed 'bomb drill' procedure. You know, just incase somebody decides to plant a bomb in a job centre then telephone them to let them know about it.

The side where we were troubled was the right, and that's probably because it was Faz's side and we were getting hit on the counter from a high line, which isn't Faz's fault really.

In fact, the whole back line was adequate. Fazio caught out with his pace, but otherwise fine and gets a bonus for shoving Fraizer Campbell after he went for Lloris.

Midfield were adequate individually but didn't have the capacity between them to do enough with the ball, and certainly weren't quick enough in transition when Palace overcomitted. This was where we lost the game, in spite of all our central midfielders in general acquitting themselves unspectularly not-badly. It was the lack of tempo in our passing that lost us the game.

Eriksen was incredibly disappointing, but Palace were allowed time to regroup between attacks because of our ponderous midfield. Chadli had a mixed game, but on balance I think it's another good performance considering the same shackles that applied to Eriksen applied to him. Townsend was genuinely poor, and I'm very surprised that Lennon wasn't brought on - I think this game is the clearest indication yet that he's being sold.

Kane and Soldado both did very well I thought, considering they had almost no service at all.

Made some crucial saves again and couldn't do anything against the palace goals.

Back four: all 6.
I actually thought we defended well, but they were all dreadfull on the ball. Moved it so slowly from side to side and it often ended in a long ball up from one of them

Dembele: 4
He has one or two runs were he looks like the old Dembele. The rest of the time is either dribbing to nowhere or sideway passes. Why is he holding on to the ball so much. It makes sense if he can advance with it, but he will often just run around in circles.

Stambouli: 3
I'm still not sure if he got the ball or not, but he always looks slow in everything he does. Why is he so far away from any opponent players. Why is he doing all those roulettes or whatever they are called, instead og just doing the simple things right.

Townsend: 2
Nothing seemed to work for Townsend today. I have a difficult time remembering anything he did today. His passing was wayyyy off.

Chadli: 3
Not good today, but got a lucky assist(if that even counts as an assist). His passing and dribbling was off today. I have been impressed with his passing lately, but today was just not good at all.

Eriksen: 4
He didn't create enough today and lost the ball more than he usually does. Closed down fine enough, but was shite defending on the right wing. He was still the only one who looked for a forward pass and to actually pass the ball around fast, with one touch passing. 

Kane: 6
He scored a good goal and that makes him our best outfield player. But he seemed off today. Didn't close down much and didn't help out defending much. I think a good example is when he dropped deep to tackle a palace player, but was too late and committed a free kick.

Of course it's a good thing that Poch has a clearly defined first XI and we saw against Chelsea what they can do when playing to their potential, but this whole thing of freezing out half of the squad and barely rotating even in cup games won't work for much longer.

Also, I must say that Stambouli sadly just seemed out of his depth. I like the guy and he seems to have the right attitude, but I don't think he has a future at Spurs.

Just to clarify, I have nothing but good faith in Poch and our future with him and I dislike the usual post-loss knee-jerking as much as the next guy.

* Shame that Costa didn't score in that run near the end, would've been brilliant

* Not feeling as strong as I was earlier in the season about our Champions League hopes, but Ill be more than happy if we can match last season. 

* Not that much of a great news, but PSG got shit on today

We have central midfielders who are good at creating scoring situations by moving the ball through the center of the park quickly, we have central midfielders who are good defensively. In my opinion we only have one midfielder who does both of these things reasonably well, and he's in Africa right now.

It's precisely because you don't feel like you should condemn the acts which is why you should, because they have nothing to do with you and are in no way part of your interpretation of Islam. The more questioning Muslims and ignorant bigots see that violence is not the face of Islam, the better it will be for social tensions in Europe between Muslims and non-Muslims.

If you phone the ESA hotline, which you sould be able to easily google, they have a quick process for people switching from JSA to ESA. Your claim for JSA stops on the day before you claim ESA, so if you phone them on, say Tuesday, or Wednesday, your claim for JSA will cease before you have to tell them what you've been up to. You will then receive full payment up to that day (assuming you're over 25, that'd be just over £10 per day. Assuming Wednesday is your signing day, you'd get paid for 13 days).

Fast track ESA takes less than a fortnight to process, so you'll be very unlucky if your payment schedule even skips a beat. Keep on at them, phone the ESA team regularly and make sure you know when the claim is due to be processed and when you can expect to be paid.

You'll need a medical cert from your doc, stating you're either unable to work, or able to work with in a lesser capacity due to ongoing health concerns. Tell your doc you're going on ESA and they should be accommodating. My doc lets me phone in and renew my cert once the old one is close to expiring, no questions asked. You need to get the cert to the ESA team ASAP. There should be a process in place where the ESA team can arrange an appointment at a Jobcentre and they'll email the cert over to the ESA team, meaning they receive it immediately, rather than the week's wait if you were to post it to them.

It's a daunting step to take, but it neatly sidesteps the problems of sanctioning and takes the pressure off what I presume is an increasingly frustrating and fruitless jobsearch.

The Premier League is poised to fine Jose Mourinho for pulling out of his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday’s game against Newcastle United.
Given Mourinho already faces a Football Association charge – and fine if found guilty – then it could be an expensive few days for the Chelsea manager or, at least, for his club. But it is one he is prepared for.
The Chelsea board is fully behind Mourinho who will fight the FA charge – he has to respond by 6pm on Tuesday – which was brought after he claimed, in the wake of his team’s draw against Southampton, that there was a “campaign” to influence referees against his side.
This has been interpreted by the FA as questioning the integrity of officials.
Mourinho will counter by arguing that he was merely contributing to a legitimate debate on refereeing standards – it is an issue, in fairness, that has been widely debated – and he will point out that in his comments he talked of a campaign led by pundits and rival managers. Not referees.

But Mourinho’s argument will not stop there. He is feeling pretty aggrieved at present. One of Chelsea’s main complaints will be the demands made on managers in terms of media commitments to rights holders – and the lack of leeway given to foreign managers in particular. Mourinho speaks very good English but it is not his first language.
Mourinho decided to duck media questions on Friday because of his FA charge and the Premier League will write to the club to ask for an explanation.
It is not the first time it has happened which means, on this occasion, when the matter is then referred back to the Premier League’s board Chelsea can expect a fine, not a warning.
First-team coach Steve Holland attended Friday’s press conference – just as he was drafted in last April when Mourinho silenced himself while under another FA charge. In total he was fined £26,000 by the FA for three separate incidents.
Under Premier League rules it is the manager who has to attend the press conferences, not a coach. Indeed the media rules are extremely specific and clubs are threatened with fines if they breach them. For example a club can be fined if it delivers a team sheet less than 75 minutes before kick-off – it used to be 60 minutes but an extra 15 minutes is now given for the television companies to draw up their graphics.
Similarly clubs are fined if they provide a player for the pre-match interviews for rights holders who is not then in the starting XI.
Previously they could put forward any squad player.
Managers have to do their media briefings within 20 minutes of the final whistle. Otherwise, another fine. And the same applies to players, who have to appear within 30 minutes of the game ending.",null,0,null,1420924887,null,0,false,0,cnktata,null,t3_2rzxiz,null,t1_cnktata,null,t3_2rzxiz,null,null,null,1424949342,null,13,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,13,null

On top of that the term ""offence"" is applied to someone's (negative) reaction to an issue seemingly straight away and as a means to shut them down or dismiss their argument.

edit: I wrote a rambling comment but have removed most of it. I type too much.

On a side note, with regard to: 

&gt; A scientist being hounded to tears because his shirt is so offensive.

Your use of the word ""hounded"" here made me reply. The first comments were along the lines of: ""Well that's not really very appropriate."" from both women and men. There was then, I think, a push-back to those comments (e.g. PC gone mad) which led (lead? brainfart) to a stronger response from people explaining why they felt there was an issue. Then the media got hold of it, then more people took either side and round and round it goes. 

Was it ""so offensive""? I'm a man so I can't really answer that. It was a horrible shirt though and I really don't understand why no-one there (e.g. his boss) said anything.

&gt;How can you be so fucking stupid or insincere as to claim that you never said that?

I literally quoted everything I said.  I know what I said.  What else do you want?  Maybe you didn't understand what I said because you were too emotionally involved in the argument to pick up on anything you weren't expecting to hear.

&gt;How can you claim that movements can have causes, but that those causes do not apply to the actions of the people who make up that movement? You do know that a movement is not a thing separate from the people who make it up, right?

The point is not complicated or stupid.  There were causes behind the rise of fascism.  Fascists did things which were irrational, stupid and evil. I can say there were causes behind them coming to power without thinking they were correct in acting as they did.  This is such a benign and obvious point, that the fact you are twisting in the wind trying to get your head round it leads me to think you've got far too emotional about the whole thing.

&gt;Here he is explicitly talking about the dangers of religious ideologies which justify violence in such a way that has nothing to do with grievances and everything to do with the toxicity of the ideas contained within it.

But can you not, please, after all, see, that there is a difference between what makes a fascist do what they do when they commit genocide, what makes a islamist do what they do when they attack cartoonists, and what made people turn to such stupid and irrational movements in the first place?! Open your brain, just a teensy bit, and sip on that idea, and swill it around before rejecting it and calling me an idiot again.  

&gt;To accuse me of ignorance, bigotry and small-mindedness because I highlighted the fact that people can be motivated to commit acts of violence by bad ideas that come from religion is really not surprising from someone who is as insincere and dishonest as you are.

Of course people can be motivated into violence by bad ideas! That's just the most obvious, asinine truism ever.  But fascism didn't take over Germany *because* it was a bad idea!  How about the Great Depression?  You're like a doctor from the middle-ages treating a disease solely by treating the symptoms.  Someone's telling you germ theory and you're calling them stupid, because how can sickness be prevented by washing your hands?  Vomit obviously doesn't come out of your hands!  How stupid!  How idiotic!  

Do you not see how we're at complete crossed purposes?  Have you no analytical mind or basic perception to see that?

Also there are different levels of support people can give a movement.  Not all islamists are suicide attackers, not all Nazis were enacting the holocaust, but those who don't attack feed the support, power and money to those who do. Hitler would have been a right wing nutcase regardless of what the Treaty of Versailles said, and he was obviously Nazi long before the Great Depression.  But the rest of Germany wouldn't have been, and I'm just saying maybe that's significant to all of 20th Century history. A nutcase ranting on a park bench is a little less threatening than a nutcase ranting from his position as sole unquestionable ruler of the most powerful nation in Europe with its laws, armies and citizenry at his complete and literal disposal.

Balo is a great example of this, especially since he is without a doubt a very talented player, but he doesn't play to our teams strengths currently. His play style needs to be adapted or the team needs to adapt to him. These players either show they can adapt or they won't get playing time--unless, of course, they are a player like Suarez/Sturridge who became a prolific duo, making it virtually impossible for Rodgers to force them into his system. With players like Balo, it seems they need to come around to our system of play or show they are on another level (warranting a system change). 

All in all, it just seems that Rodgers is a manager that has little qualms of not playing a player if he doesn't think they are a strength to the team as a whole. People on this sub see things very one-dimensionally, seeing a players strengths individually, but not how they fit into a particular system of play.

As much as the ref hurt us, our style of play was so reminiscent of every bad match since Redknapp left.  We need to change up the squad.  Dembele is horribly indirect and slow moving the ball around.  Stambouli is not the CDM of a side chasing 4th.  Paulinho possibly deserves at least some more time this season, but he's been so horrible since we signed him that I can't blame Poch for not wanting to take too much of a chance.

That Bentaleb and Mason are our best midfield options, despite neither being truly outstanding players, tells us how bad our midfield is.

OP, don't read this next bit. It'll only depress you. 20/20 hindsight and all that.

It's worth mentioning to others that specialist cycle insurers like Cycleguard do not pay out if you've left your bike in a stairwell, even if it's locked. It's not worth it to them to insure it, so that should tell you something about how frequently bikes are stolen from those locations. 

They also won't pay out if you don't have locks rated to the right standards (usually Silver for a mid range bike), so that should tell you how frequently bikes are stolen with cheap-o locks. Contents insurance policies probably won't cover bikes left in the stairwell.

So keep those bikes inside, and use two or three high rated locks when out in public. There are two bikes chained up in my stairwell right now. I don't know who owns them, otherwise I'd tell them how easy it is to cut those chains and ride way. Luckily for them, the bikes are pieces of shit so I doubt anyone will bother.

I'd went 4 weeks without anything coming in waiting for my appeal to be heard).

The final email I sent to them I copied in the local newspaper. That was enough for his secretary to phone me back. She gave me an appointment time to meet her and asked me to bring along all the evidence I had. When I got there she handed me the phone so I could try one last time at getting it sorted before she took over my case. So I phoned the jobcentre and explained that I was now 4 weeks into waiting to hear about my appeal and the woman on the other end of the line informed me that no such appeal was in place and that I'd have to lodge another appeal which would take a further 4 weeks to hear back from them.

The MP's secretary was sat next to me listening in and that got her fuming, considering my original appeal was handed in in person at the jobcentre and I had the evidence to show it was. 

I signed a form saying I was handing my case over to the local MP's office to handle and that afternoon she gave me a ring just before her office closed for the day. She let me know that she had made a few phonecalls and that if I hadn't heard anything by the next day, she'd use the MPs email address and get somebody higher up to deal with it.

The next day she did just that and pretty much immediately I had somebody on the phone letting me know that my sanction was being overturned and the back payment would be in my account by the end of the day.

Funnily enough, when my 9th sanction came around for the same reason things were way more streamlined. I got the sanction letter through the door in the morning, by that afternoon I got a phonecall letting me know that that sanction was being overturned without me even having to lodge an appeal. So I'm unsure what happened to cause that but was pretty grateful that I didn't have to wait however many weeks to get it sorted.

The problem was I was on the work programme with Avanta. It was them that kept screwing up my address on their system and every time I brought it up with them I just got fobbed off. At one point my advisor at Avanta accused me of starting an argument when I brought up all of these sanctions and stormed away from her desk to calm down, leaving me sat there for 20 minutes before she returned.

Phase 1 - remove deadwood. Comolli, for all his faults, did this side of the job well - off fucked Poulsen, Konchesky, Jovanovic, N'Gog, Degen, El Zhar...plus Meireles being sold after wanting much higher wages, and Kyrgiakos going as well. Loaning out Cole and Aquilani cut the wage bill further.

Phase 2 - remove players who have quality, but whose wages exceed their on-the-pitch contributions. This is why Kuyt, Bellamy and Maxi were moved on. All three could still have contributed, but Kuyt especially was on CL wages. Aquilani left then as well, and its the same philosophy behind Agger and Reina being moved on.

Also, your list of players is a strange one - Martin Kelly wouldn't have made a big dent on our wage bill, and Luis Suarez is someone we'd have been happy to pay even more if it kept him. Keep in mind all the new summer signings will have added to the wage bill, too.

Into the dalek - I think it's the best DALEK episode since dalek. It wasn't overdone with heaps of dalek's invading. It was about a small group of people and one dalek. I hope to see rusty again. 

Robots of Sherwood. - BAD EPISODE!! This was almost as bad as 'Father's Day' (my least favorite episode of dr who full stop) there was a lot of humor in it which was great, but the story itself just made no sense.

Listen. - great episode. Wish it had a proper ending. But still a great psychological thriller. I wish they addressed the thing under the sheets more, but the fact they didn't kind of makes it creepier..

Time heist - not a stand out episode, but not terrible either. Don't have much to say about this episode. But I didn't hate it.

The caretaker - meh, could have been better

Kill the moon - I just wish the moon egg thing was the star whale. Also the creature laying an egg as big as itself as soon as its born is kinda weird and made me not like the episode. 

Mummy on the orient express - how could anyone fault this episode? It was brilliant! 

Flatline - also another brilliant episode. I have no faults.

In the forest of the night - very forgettable episode.

Dark water - I think was a great cliffhanger, I liked missy, I liked how she portrayed the master.

Death in heaven - I know a lot of people didn't like this episode, I thought it was good, Letting DANNY be the hero was almost like the doctor accepting him. And I felt that the doctor being president of the world in a master episode was great. It felt like a table turn on ""the last of the timelords"" (but nobody got preyed back into existence or whatever)

Last Christmas - I actually enjoyed this quite a lot, one of the best Christmas eps yet.

All in all, there were a few weak episodes but every season seams to have them. This season was fairly strong overall, and now that DANNY is gone I think it will be heading in the right direction.

When considering individual stocks you assess profitability of the company, what their experience in the market is, the nature and future of their market, their debt, assets and so on. See *Intelligent Investor* &amp;c from [the recommended reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/recommendedreading).

If you don't want to do this, tracker funds may be chosen - they follow an index like the [FTSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index), to hedge your investment across a bunch of big companies which are established as profitable.

Recognising the inherently speculative nature of investment, you will probably want at least some money in one or more index trackers.

There is a considerable body of opinion regarding the difficulty of [beating the market](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/03/12/why-smart-people-fail-to-beat-the-market/). Many people swear it's [impossible](http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/investor-alley/active-stock-pickers-can-now-beat-the-market/msg173153/?#msg173153) to do so. I cannot offer you better advice than to tell you to stick it all in [bonds and trackers](http://www.bogleheads.org/blog/the-three-fund-portfolio/) ([more](http://monevator.com/category/investing/passive-investing-investing/)).

Bonds are chosen because their returns are more certain than those from stocks (or stock trackers). Since you're young, and I get the impression you're in employment and plan to stay so for some years, you may favour stocks (or stock trackers) over bonds - they are more prone to fluctuation, but tend to give better returns over periods measured in decades. I think it's advised to move from stocks to bonds as you approach retirement. 

You will want to [hedge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_\(finance\)) between European &amp; US markets, possibly including some ""emerging"" countries, too. You can do this by buying two or more different trackers, or you can buy a single fund that tracks stock indices from more than one country.

If you're buying funds that aren't a tracker, then I'd assume they either track a certain sector, or they're otherwise managed. In the case of managed general funds then I think the fund manager usually offers a statement explaining what his goals and investment philosophy is, but generally speaking you're betting on him and on his ability to beat the market.

In the case of funds spread across a certain sector (holding shares in a bunch of pharmaceutical or mining companies) you're back to considering whether that's a market in growth, how recent changes to patent law or licensing will affect the pharmaceutical industry and so on.

All funds and trackers have some management fees, which are important to be aware of. 1% or 2% a year can make a huge difference over 20 years. See [here](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_and_fees) and, I think, [here](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios). For trackers, everyone raves about Vanguard who are, apparently, loads cheaper than everyone else. 

You don't want to have too much or too little risk. You should choose some investments which look like they may promise growth, and you should choose some safe investments in case they don't. It probably wouldn't do you any harm to set yourself a *strict* budget, like £100 a month (I'm not sure what stockbrokers charge these days) and stick that in shares, so that you're doing your own research and spreadsheeting them so that you can see how readily investments go down as well as up.",null,0,null,1420933684,null,0,false,0,cnky4br,null,t3_2ruiyh,null,t1_cnky4br,null,t1_cnkj4a2,null,null,null,1424946983,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

2: None of Charlie's staff were racist or islamophobic. Charb, the editor-in-chief who approved (and often drew) cartoons of Mohammad had a Muslim girlfriend, Jeannette Bougrab.

3: Charlie Hebdo was less and less popular in recent times, and understood controversy was an easy path to fame. That's the main reason behind the islamophobic issues, a simple cash-grab.

 I think we need either 3 or 4 players to strengthen the squad. We need a striker, obviously, a fullback for each side, and a defensive midfielder. 
Here's who I want:

**Idrissa Gueye, 25, Defensive Midfielder (Lille)**

Gueye is my dream signing at this position. He has 2 goals and 2 assists so far this season for Lille, but his main strengths lie in his defensive capabilities. He makes 3 tackles and 2 interceptions per game, meaning he'd lead our team in tackles, and have the third most interceptions per game, while also being able to contribute offensively. Because Lille has had financial problems this season, he should be available for around 4-7 million.

**Arkadiusz Milik, 20, Striker (Bayer Leverkusen/Ajax)**

Milik is a young striker on loan at Ajax this season and has scored 8 goals and made 3 assists in 11 appearances (8 started) in the Eredivise alone. He fell slightly out of favor at Leverkusen and is reportedly available on a 2.5 million buyout for Ajax. If we could manage to sign him for under 4 million, I'd be very happy, but the right circumstance would have to happen.

**Djibril Sidibe, 22, Fullback R/L (Lille)**

I'm going for the Lille double swoop. Sidibe and Gueye will be out for AFCON, but they're too good to pass up on. Sidibe kills two birds with one stone as he plays on the right and left. He makes more tackles than Gueye and can also make a great offensive contribution. He's been good this season, could fetch 4-6 million. If we can get Gueye and Sidibe for under 15 million, considering its a double swoop in January, I'd take it.

**Adam Matthews, 22, Fullback R (Celtic)**

Clear choice. Local, talented, cheap, useful. 2-3 million.

**Window Total (Maximum Prices with January Bumps)**

Gueye and Sidibe: 15 million

Milik: 5 million

Matthews: 3 million

Total: 23 million

Profit: 4 million

I weighed myself for the first time a couple of days ago. I'm 6ft 0 and down to 8st 4lbs. No wonder people aren't hiring me, I barely look like I'm going to make it through to the end of the day due to having to go days without eating (I even got denied the use of foodbanks because I wasn't homeless and didn't have children). 

It's been amazing being back at the parents so far though, I'm working on getting back up to a healthy weight with the help from a lot of milk and food and with that it'll give me far more confidence when it comes to interviews and work trials. You'd think the work programme would help you get a job as opposed to hindering your abilities and dropping you into a shit load of debt to the point where you find yourself rationing an old box of cereal over 2 days for something to eat.

I still have some deep hatred for the woman that put me through it all and I'd give anything to have her go through what she put me through.

Where are the lists of budgets and time projections from the tories or labour? And how has their track record been with matching those projected targets anyway? It shouldn't matter how long it would take because these kinds of changes are needed to progress as a civilisation.

Where did Ian Duncan Smith pull that abhorrent and arbitrary budget cut figure from? Why does it even matter if the UK economy is in debt or for how long for? Its just numbers of a computer at this point. I mean, they changed how that number is calculated and suddenly there was an extra [£127bn.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11117335/Just-how-big-is-Britains-debt-mountain.html). 

On your points on climate change, we can't control the actions of those countries. That doesn't mean we shouldn't alter our own behaviour; to lead as an example and for the very important sake of not destroying the planets ecosystem more than we already have. We can't just carry on as normal because ""they are still doing it"".

We have got to start somewhere. 

I mean, come on... doesn't fully renewable, self sustaining energy sound great? 

The only reason it isn't happening is because fossil fuel corporations lobby government and gain massive advantages such as [$544bn in subsidies.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27142377) 
And yet you ask where cost of renewable energy would come from? Which consists of the initial start-up costs, then minor maintenance costing far less than getting access to fossil fuels does. eg: Fracking

The Basic Income (a seemingly far away policy that i think would drastically improve life for everyone in a multitude of ways... but thats a different matter) is actually [ridiculously affordable](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/08/citizens-income-71-week-person-would-make-britain-fairer).

As u/doom_halo mentioned hucknall and bulwell are a tad shit (of course this is subjective). I have lived in a few different areas in Nottingham, and if it were me I would look to live in either mapperly or Arnold. mapperly is going to be more expensive for rent but has a good selection of pubs and bars, whereas Arnold is a pretty good area with pubs and shops. Both of these areas are on the right side of town for commuting to Mansfield, but are a short journey into the Center of Notts. 

You could even live in notts, I know a few people who commute the other way round (Mansfield to notts), but I would certainly recommend living in Notts over Mansfield.

Especially as, sadly, as someone with mental health problems, you can be seen as an 'easy sanction.'   I'd suggest calling around, see if your local council has a welfare officer or if there's any other local advice, maybe ask the CAB if there's anyone local who can assist, the CAB are usually too busy to do much but they may know of people.

There again, you might get an advisor with a damned clue and with some compassion that hasn't been kicked out of them by the job (Note I'm blaming the job and those in the higher echelons for how some advisors end up being), and they'll accept your situation and that you're trying.

Still, I strongly advise applying for ESA, you should get into the word related group, and then you can apply for work, but won't be hounded daily to 'prove' yourself, and they have to then account for your health issues.

&gt; Why does it even matter if the UK economy is in debt or for how long for?

If the UK isn't in debt, then it has surplus money which can be used on well whatever a Government decides to use it. The longer the debt drags on, the more interest is put on and therefore the worse the credit rating goes. This then makes it harder it is for the UK to borrow and makes the UK a less attractive place for business. This then causes many economic issues, which as we have seen throughout history and in the modern world it can have serious consequences Examples:
[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_%28political_party%29)
[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_%28France%29)
[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_Radical_Left)

Who all threaten to not only leave the EU, but ensure it fails.

&gt; I mean, come on... doesn't fully renewable, self sustaining energy sound great?

It sounds great yes, but in reality, the efforts as I said would be futile, Russia and China are still going to churn out tons of fossil fuels, so until we change every nations minds on climate change, the world will get worse. The Environment is a world issue, the world needs to work together.

&gt; The only reason it isn't happening is because fossil fuel corporations lobby government and gain massive advantages such as $544bn in subsidies. And yet you ask where cost of renewable energy would come from? Which consists of the initial start-up costs, then minor maintenance costing far less than getting access to fossil fuels does. eg: Fracking

If Eco-tech companies want their ideas to become policies, then they need to lobby harder and get in with the right MPs and Lords to actually succeed. That's how lobbying works, some are successful, some aren't. 

&gt; And yet you ask where cost of renewable energy would come from?

I would want to know what type of renewable energy would be used, and how much will it cost. Ideas have to be put under scrutiny to have credibility.

&gt; Build truly affordable housing, and stop demolishing existing homes.

Where will we put the new houses, without making everything cramped for everyone. There are a lot of people and limited space.

I am not easily swayed by promises and buzzwords. So I would need questions answered in detail before I would make a decision on any party. I am not wasting my first vote.

Anyway, I realised I'd left 'voluntarily' even tho it's down to mental health stuff, and I didn't have a supportive doctor, so I knew he'd be wasting my time if I went to him for help, so I just put the facts down on why I left the job, and then found out about a little known clause.

Anyway if you have contributed to the country throughout your life, we have every reason to lool after you, immigrant or not.

Edit: also thoight I'd add, not all non-EU migrants are a burden at all. Sikhs, who I imagine mainly come from Southern Asia, make up around 4% of the popualtion but around 6% of GDP. That is not bad. I imagine immigrants from North America, Japan, Korea, australia etc are on the whole beneficial to the economy.

There is a lot of scapegoating on immigrants at the moment. Yes there is a problem with excess demand on the NHS and schooling, but other than those I think that immigration on the whole is a benefit to the UK.

You might need to look at increasing your work hours perhaps if you're not making enough at the moment, that's what I did when I was in your situation.

First thing to do is to create a budget sheet. Work out how much you need to live reasonably. Make sure you count for:

- rent
- gas, electric, and water bills
- council tax (If you're in Full time education, you won't need to pay this)
- internet and phone bills
- transport costs, or car costs if you drive including insurance and tax.
- other bits and bobs like the TV license if you want one, and ""social costs"" if you're a bit of a social bee and like to go out a lot.

Also don't forget that when you move out, you'll most likely need to pay agency fees and a security deposit. This is a considerable cost in my opinion.

Also, think about whether you'll need furniture and appliances.

Once you've got the total monthly outgoings, work out whether you need to work more in order to achieve that. My advice is always to overestimate because it's just better to be on the safe side.

Useful tip:

You must learn how to cook properly. I can't stress this enough. It will save you a fuck-tonne of money. I know it sounds so simple, but a lot of people often don't know how to cook basic meals or even make good shopping decisions so make sure you got that covered.

I think your claim is fundamentally flawed that no platform policies are about the venue's rights to invite who they want.  Rather it's an attempt to rule by the mob - to force venues into disinviting controversial speakers or to get stores to drop magazines.  

Should a medical conference give a platform to homeopaths?  Yes, if they're invited, but they won't be, because the conference organizers don't generally invite quacks to speak at their conferences.  BUT, science conferences do have to deal with controversial new ideas and it would be absolutely untenable for them to drop invited speakers because they were deemed unpopular.

Science in general does *not* work according to a popularity contest or according to democratic vote.  Anyone, even homeopaths or creationists are allowed to submit their results to a journal and if the results can get past peer-review then they will be published.  Of course, they never do get past peer review, but that's not because the ideas are deemed unpopular, or too controversial.  It's because the authors can't answer the peer-reviewers questions.  It's because the claims don't stand up to scrutiny.

Note however, that science does *not* ban any ideas.  It does *not* deny *any* claim a platform based on its unpopularity or because of campaigners of activists have managed to shut down speech.

What's really important is what's good for Greece. I realize this is British Politics not Europe, but I personally feel like the farce of Germany sharing a currency with Greece in a political and economic union, in which Germany is a dominant player, has been given its chance.

However, what does Syriza plan to do once Greece leaves the EU? What do they plan to do for money - both in currency terms (will they keep using the Euro? Who would accept a Greek currency as payment?); and in financial terms (who will bail them out after default?).

Most voting Greeks have probably considered this, or at least had it crossed their mind. If they elect a Government that *seriously* wants to leave the EU, it's because they really want it.

End of time from memory was meant to be ""New Years special"" done on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. (Hence why it's a two parter)

Snowmen is probably one of my favourite Christmas episodes. Mainly for the humour. I was hoping for the great intelligence would be a re occurring bad guy over multiple seasons. 

Time of the doctor was probably the worst Christmas episode. Only good thing about it was the regen.

Dr who was originally meant to be an ""educational kids show"" I think Moffat tries to account for the kids sometimes for that reason. 

I actually loved the last Christmas, I was afraid they were going to make Santa a real person. And I'm glad they made him a dream.

Member students' unions have their own policies. It's not about banning ideas being discussed at other venues - they couldn't even if they were trying to. The policy only applies to venues run by that organisation. 

The main thing that the NUS no platform policy is about is not having racist speakers. This is not a recent idea, so 'controversial new ideas' isn't relevant. Just as you say homeopaths wouldn't be invited because they're quacks, unions would not invite racist speakers.

I've spoken to the people who were union officers of SUs in the 70s when the policy was being written. I've spoken to NUS officers from the same time. I've spoken to current NUS officers and staff about the policy and how it works. I used to actively campaign for abolishing the policy when I was active in student politics. I have clearly since changed my mind. It really isn't about banning conversations from happening because they're unpopular or controversial topics. It's about opposition to racism on campus.
