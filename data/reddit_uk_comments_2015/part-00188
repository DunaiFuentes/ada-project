Water alone does not hydrate the body: we need a balance of minerals, essential fatty acids to hold onto that. When we sweat we lose minerals/ electrolytes so this can be a real challenge for those who are fit.

Arsenal have done it the way we want to. They have just done a much better job of it than we have.

If we could get a decent replacement I'd let him go for £25m. Don't get me wrong, I like Sterling and I like what he's about but he is not nearly the player that our fans make him out to be. 

He's young, granted, but aside from blistering pace and quick feet (quick, but not technically gifted like Coutinho) he doesn't add a whole lot. He's absolutely horrific in front of goal, and completely and totally useless from the edge of the box - now that sounds like an exaggeration but take the united game for example, he cost us that game. 3 stone wall chances wasted. Final third to be honest he adds very little. He's not a match winner, not even close, this wouldn't be like losing Suarez or Studge (if he was fit this year). 

If we could get Milner in *for example*, and he was to bang in 10-13 goals in the league, he adds far more to a team than Raheem does tactically, defensively and even going forward, so short term we'd be genuinely taking a step forward quality wise. 

Again, I like Sterling as a player, he's a joy to watch and will be a very good player (maybe not the heights people expect) but if he wants to go after achieving nothing at liverpool (individually or collectively) then fuck him, let him go. I'd sooner rely on someone who will be quality now than a huge prospect that thinks he's better than he is. He wouldn't get into Chelsea, Arsenal, City or United's first xi, so why do we rate him so highly? 

A good player in a technical team, not a great player and not that effective a player either. The biggest loss would be a sense of pride in that we can't hang on to our players.

I'm still not convinced by Paulinho, but it's not his quality that has me unable to convince myself: it's how sporadic his performances are. One week he is hitting above 85% pass averages and making one to two key passes. The following week it's mid b 70's and he lacks any desire to go from box to box. He looks great in our Europa games, but when handed a starting role in EPL he often goes missing. When you pair an international footballer with a young CM in Bentaleb, he should not be going missing for over half an hour. Sure, against West Brom he put in a shift (with a yellow), but against Liverpool  he came on and made no impact on the situation. 

I don't particularly agree with the Bale/Eriksen swap either. I'd much rather move Chadli out of the way for Bale than vice-versa. Bale playing a true winger would open up that gap for Eriksen to roam in the 10; Chadli and Lamela wanting to come inside cramps Eriksen's space making him essentially fodder in the middle.

You seem to have a strange delusion that the media should only report on a very narrow spectrum which you personally are interested in and that it should completely ignore anything else regardless of the views of others. Just because the BBC discusses a wide range of topics it doesn't mean they are detracting from the injustices in the world.

In just two, the Brazilian played the full 90 minutes, having added so far only one assist and no goals scored. For a former teammate, however, the steering wheel is just another victim of the London team.

""It's the club (the blame). Certainly would not recommend to anyone. It's not just buy and wait surrender, have to help in adaptation. Willian went to Chelsea and is yielding but could be leaning against Tottenham,"" he said Goalkeeper Gomes, now at Watford, vice-champion of the second division.

Gomes talks as very hurt by Tottenham. Team player between 2008 and 2014, the match started very well his career in England and played including one Champions League, made not very usual in the team. From the 2011/2012 season, however, he had problems with coach Harry Redknapp and entered into friction with the club.

""If it was the other coach, my career would continue at Tottenham. If it were another club, let me follow my life elsewhere. It was disrespectful to my career. I had proposed Hoffenheim (time for which he served borrowed in 2013), but demanded 5 million pounds to release me. I never gave any trouble and so I decided to wait until the end of my contract, ""he reported the player, which revealed a query Santos in January this year, when preferred to follow in England.

For Gomes, the Tottenham disregard for new players is not just to Brazilians. ""They paid 28 million pounds in the Soldier and not surrendered. Has Lamela, who was a great promise of Europe, and today you watch games Tottenham and looks like he can not play ball.""

Paulinho complete next weekend his second season in England, with reserve team and having lost ground in the national team. After starting the World Cup as a starter and go to the bench in the quarterfinals, the steering wheel was no longer called after the World Cup. A departure from Tottenham and a return to Brazilian football are speculated at all times.

""It has market in Europe, is a great player and everyone knows his quality. But it is in a difficult club to adapt, and when you are not happy things do not happen,"" concluded Gomes.",null,0,null,1432044294,null,0,false,0,cre1lz6,null,t3_36hqss,null,t1_cre1lz6,null,t3_36hqss,null,null,null,1433148439,null,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

null,false,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,null,"For a tenancy to be ended by the landlord, the landlord **must** issue formal notice, whether or not you're in a fixed term or periodic tenancy is irrelevant. The June 30th date in your contract is meaningless if you want to stay: but it does give you the option to just leave (without providing notice) by that date -- but it's nice to let the letting agents know if you plan to do that. If they want you to leave on June 30th they need to have issued a notice to quit by April 30th (and even then, they'd have to go to court to get an eviction if you chose to stay, which can take *months*).

You absolutely do not have to leave on June 30th. I won't call it a ""scam"", but it's a common *thing* for letting agents to mislead people into believing they need to be in fixed term contracts and they do this because they make good money on the fees. They spend the cost of 10 minutes labour and some printer ink to print a new contract... and charge hundreds for it.

If you haven't heard from the letting agents by June 1st (with a notice to quit, if they just send a letter asking you to contact them you can ignore it) that means the **earliest** they could have you out by (assuming you choose to leave on request) is August 30th, longer if you chose to ignore the notice and forced them to go for a formal eviction (I don't advise that though).

You'll find that *most* letting agents, when faced with someone who knows the rules, will just let you revert to a periodic tenancy. They'd rather have someone paying rent periodically than deal with finding a new tenant (unless you're in a really high demand area, like central London, where they could up the rent by 20% just by getting a new tenant in...).

I earn a decent amount above the London average so does my brother, but I can't afford a house without lumbering myself with a ridiculously uneven mortgage. I can only save while renting because I'm living with my girlfriend AND I've got a good deal with my landlady.

I'm sick of hearing these cunts talk down to normal people. I'm a ""dirty"" lefty and I always will be.

I believe that we can have responsible capitalism and a fairer society, but we won't get it from these bastards and their self serving cronyism. Especially not when about 33% of our MPs are buy-to-let landlords

I hate what London is becoming; a city for the super-rich serviced by us.

I hate what the UK is becoming; more and more divided whilst the rich laugh all the way to the bank.

Not a single person was prosecuted for the 2008 crash, not a single person was prosecuted for the FX fixing from the big banks, no one at J P Morgan was prosecuting for manipulating the silver markets and nothing was done about RBS PURPOSEFULLY bankrupting small businesses so they can seize and sell off their assets, but be down on your luck in the UK and require help from the welfare state and you're a scrounger.

Because it's extremely hard to get such a large fanbase moving in the same direction.

Also, if I've learned one thing, it's that you can count on people of that age to be stupid. I should know. I'm 20 years old and I'm incredibly stupid.

I can see the merits of both making him stay and selling him. I don't necessarily think that selling him shows weakness from the point of view of the club, but making him stay also doesn't necessarily show strength. There's no single best course of action here.

The judge's opinion, that 'same-sex marriage is inextricably linked to sexual relations between same sex couples' and therefore refusing to bake a cake advocating same sex marriage is absolutely ludicrous at the best of times, but is absolutely farcical in this instance given the legal status of gay marriage in Northern Ireland.

How can same-sex marriage be 'inextricably linked' to sexual relations between same sex couples when same sex marriage isn't even legal in Northern Ireland? Does that mean there's no such thing as a same sex couple in Northern Ireland given they can't form the same sex marriage that is apparently so linked to their sexual relationship? I

t's beyond me how a judge could ever write that piece of farce in a legal decision.

Religious freedom - Is it illegal for a Christian to refuse to print leaflets for a satanist's gathering? Is it illegal for a psychiatric graduate to refuse to print invitations to a Scientology event? Is it illegal for an archaeological graduate to refuse to print an article on Young earth Creationsim?

Political freedom - is it illegal for a Unionist to refuse to print a pamphlet promoting a United Ireland? Is it illegal for a Muslim to refuse to print flyers for an EDL march? Is it illegal for a DUP supporter to refuse to print Sinn Fein campaign flyers?

Private life freedom (which is what gay rights are included under) - Is it illegal for a Christian to refuse to print flyers supporting polygamy?

This is how my routine looks like now

**AM**

* **Dove Beauty Bar Pure &amp; Sensitive**
* **Aldi Biocura Aqua-Complete Multi-Intensif Serum** + **SebaMed Clear Face Care Ge**l + **Sunflower oil** *(I need to find a more effective hydrator/moisturizer; I'm just finishing those up)*
* Sunscreen: **Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF50/PA+++** or **Levevis Sun Protection Ansigtscreme SPF 30** *(still being tested)* or **Nivea Sun Protect Plus Skin Creamy UV Essence SPF50+/PA++++** *(too drying for my skin; finishing up 3 tubes of this, too)* or **La Roche-Posay Anthelios XL Fluid Ultra-Light SPF 50+/PPD 42** *(on high exposure days)*

**PM**

* **Garnier Micellar Water**
* **sunflower oil cleansing**, wiped with damp washcloth
* **Dove Beauty Bar Pure &amp; Sensitive**
* **Retin-A 0.025% Cream** / **Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir** *(alternate nights)*

**As needed**

* **Vaseline** *(when needing extra moisture; it's an occlusive so it keeps moisture in)*
* **Duac** *(for occasional breakouts, also PD flareup treatment)*
* **Canesten Cream** *(SD flareup treatment)*

I'm planning to order some serums from **Skin Actives**. I used to like their **Antioxidant Serum** and planning to go back using it. Also testing out the **Vitamin C Serum**.

I'm also planning to add some moisture lotion (toner) for AM after the serum and before ss, and probably night after cleansing and before treatment. My face is a bit drier now after recently irritated from trying out sunscreens with avobenzone (didn't realize my skin was highly sensitive to the substance and I've bought a ton -_-). I'm thinking **Clinique Moisture Surge Spray**, **Kohaku-Hada Moist Lotion** or **CeraColla Super Moist Lotion**.

I also love **Skinoren**, but right now it doesn't have a place in my routine as it may be too drying after my recent ordeal. I may or may not be reincorporate it into my routine, but I'll always love it. *~cue cheesy music~*

What I know surely triggers my SD/PD flareups are:

* olive oil and most high oleic oils
* cyclopenta/tetra/hexasiloxane
* isocetyl stearate
* squalane - *a strong suspicion; 3 products having squalane I tried flared up my SD; but they had other potential triggers as well, so I still can't conclude it*

To give you some more idea, whenever I get SD flareup, my skin in the SD-prone area starts to look like the sebum is floating over crusty looking skin. It sounds ridiculous, but you'll know it when you see it. Then it starts flaking, then it gets itchy, then some blisters that initially look like hives pop up.
Some other people experience warming sensation, but I don't think I do (or maybe I was too busy scratching my face that I didn't notice it). It's basically face dandruff. Some people experience horrible crusting/thickening of skin. If you google it up, the images depict the hard-core cases. Mine is considered mild, but still mighty annoying.

It's the same with discrimination. Straight-up saying ""I refuse to serve you, because you're gay"" is clear-cut discrimination, but, again, most of the time the context is not so clear.

I've pasted some of the text I wrote then below, for consideration, but I feel the most important thing to point out is that any movement or boycott is likely to be unsuccessful unless it has a clearly defined objective. Consider the failure of the Occupy movement as an example.

At the time I wrote what I considered to be fair objectives but it would be interesting to see what others feel.

Copied text:

- Respective Federations/FAs
- FIFA Sponsors (Sony, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Visa, Hyundai/Kia, Emirates, BP, Budweiser?)
- [World Cup Broadcasters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Broadcasting_rights)

A draft letter should perhaps include a statement of intent by the individual to boycott attendance of matches or the purchase/use of products manufactured and supplied by sponsors/broadcasters/merchandisers. 

A statement outlining the basis for the complaint could follow, perhaps including concerns regarding:

- Alleged corruption in the bidding process
- Inability of host nation to deliver on the criteria upon which their bid won, specifically holding the tournament during the summer and the potential inability to supply [enough stadiums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Cost) and the potential that the tournament may need to spill into neighbouring countries 
-  Human rights concerns including the abuse of rights, and deaths, of [migrant workers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Migrant_workers.2C_slavery_and_death_of_1100_slaves) and persecution of individuals based on their [sexual orientation](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/qatar-2022-kuwait-gay-tests-fifa-world-512285)
- Allegations of [state sponsored terrorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism#Qatar)

Thereafter, an indication that this boycott would continue until the responsible entity (FA/Sponsor/Broadcaster) puts sufficient pressure on FIFA until desired resolutions are met. Perhaps:

- The release of the unedited Michael J. Garcia report
- An open and transparent re-vote overseen by an independent adjudicator. Perhaps restricted to the original bidders and allowing proposals for holding the tournament in summer or winter. 

Maybe something like that could be a start.

I wasn't so much bringing those things up to state ""here are some specific and exact problems that will appear"", more to highlight that there are still many questions surrounding this and things that need to be answered. This whole thing just seems to push further the idea that all jobseekers are work-shy scroungers who need to be forced into work by making their ""life on benefits"" shit, too.

Let's for a minute say that those ""work-shy scroungers"" make up 5% of the unemployed. This policy punishes the 95% of jobseekers who are actively seeking work by forcing them into underemployment and decreasing the amount of time they actually have to jobhunt, just to stop that 5% for scrounging. Even if we skew the percentages to a more even ratio, is it really fair to do?

It leaves ten hours a work-week to jobhunt. Two hours a day (lel I fucked up the simple maths there) and they also have to travel to and from work in that. How are they supposed to cram everything into that?

My wife is a pescetarian (I.e eats fish and shellfish but no meat) and I am practically.

That will probably do us 7 days, including breakfast, work lunches and one meal out a week (often sat lunch) and perhaps and a takeaway every fortnight or so. 

We can afford it, comfortably, and cooking is one of our main hobbies. I do also include eating out as part of our food budget. 

Tend to shop through ocado, although I'll visit a local fishmonger, farm shop, organic shop &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; wine merchants for various items as and when. We also have a subscription for coffee. I've also been known to visit a rather wonderful cheese shop about 30 mins drive away.

Wheel bearings you want to lift the wheel off the ground using a stand and try and wiggle the top and bottom from side to side - if you feel any play that isn't just rotation then your bearings are knackered and you need to get them replaced.

They got pregnant again, and had twins.  They wanted to move back to the UK, so they could be near family for support etc, because our father had been very ill and they wanted to be nearer, but also so that they could reduce some of their costs like healthcare.

Husband got offered a job earning ~100k in the UK. But the rules had changed since they left the UK and the Immigration chaps refused a spousal visa for him on the basis that my sister did not have a consistent history of earning 28k per annum, what with bringing up children and all.  They did not care about his income, or the fact that this effectively meant that she had to chose between living with her husband or living in her country of birth.  I wrote to my MP - he agreed that this was not a good or moral decision, but basically we could all fuck off, because net immigration had to come down somehow...

Eventually, he was able to secure a job with a visa attached, but this does mean that their remaining here is dependent on him not losing the job, or even wanting to move job.

These failings were due to lacking a striker and for a while a defense as well. Now our defense is solid and we will have new strikers coming in this summer. This criticizes our transfer policy, with young players at the focus, but we have never been successful buying old and ""proven"" players and won't be. He's pointing out the obvious, but I don't think it's such a bad thing. It's more effective to build a team than buy one, buying older players and expecting them to fit together like puzzle pieces works to some degree, but isn't as effective as developing a team together, which is what we're doing. The financial fair play rules are being relaxed, that's fine, the fact is we aren't really competing for many of the same players those other clubs are, we have a different transfer policy, so they'll buy an extra di Maria and we'll get another coutinho, I'm fine with that and don't think that'll be too terribly detrimental. Third in the ""triple whammy"" is Raheem sterling leaving. He's had his head in the clouds last since last season and is of course frustrated with this one. He's been played out of position and feels attacked by just about everyone. If you guys really want to do something bombard his Twitter with YNWA, I'm sure he's been feeling alienated for a while now. The kid is 20, I could not handle the pressure being put on him. 100,000 a week is plenty and he still wants to leave so it's obviously a different problem than the money. If we didn't put him under a microscope, I bet you all he wouldn't be wanting to leave right now. So go ahead and point out that Raheem is leaving, it's sad but honestly I think of our own doing. Still, we have attackers to replace him and money to compensate for when he leaves.

Learn to fucking read. 

This is exactly what happens

Derp derp gets scammed by a recruiting Agency from HIS OWN COUNTRY. They tell the employee in Qatar that this guy wants the job. They charge the guy from lets say ""Nepal"" $600. The person accepts the contract, goes to Qatar, once he is there, he says ""Why did you pay me $165 I was promised $300"", they tell him his contract stated $165. He dislikes it, and thinks he is being ripped off, and wants to quit to find another job.

Guess what? He can quit, and if he can't pay for a ticket back home, gets shipped back home for free.  Except he doesn't want to, he wants another job. Well in his contract that allowed him permission to come to ""Qatar"" for this ""X"" job. THAT IS HOW WORK VISAS are implemented. He doesn't want to quit cause he got scammed by his own Countries Recruiting Agency, he then rather finishes his contract there for pay.

Is the living their miserable for these guys? most likely.

Yes - the banks have LOTS of assets. Really good ones too. Plus we get the money back. It's not entirely a bad thing. Some banks are really nervous of this.

&gt; I wasn't aware of this, do you have a source? 

When you work in any financial institution you HAVE to go through compliance training now. What's amusing about this is that within some training they highlight who's actually been done and why (for example I know a bunch of UBS CEO's and MD's have been done). When you google it the results seem to have been rather efficiently 'cleaned' and only a few 'rogue' bankers returned.

Where this case differs is the fact that the specific law in question (related to marriage equality) is about gender and sexual orientation, which happen to be protected classes. A business cannot legally discriminate against somebody on the grounds of gender or sexual orientation, and this protection trumps the ""deeply held religious views"" of the business owners.

FSG wants to buy potential and turn it into talent. If that policy was mixed with buying the occasional world class player, it would be ideal. When it's not, like now, it's just a ridiculous notion. 

Players like Sterling and Markovic and Can are told that they have enough talent and potential to be world beaters. They do. However, after one or two seasons of sitting at a club that has almost no ambition and cannot even secure CL football, why would they want to stay?

In a election which was considered close by everyone the determining factor for many people is ""who will be PM"". In this respect Cameron won hands down: he was trusted with the economy, he appeared prime ministerial, he looked as though he could hold his ground against other world leaders. Even though Labour's actual policies were more widely liked its leader was seen as inadequate.

I'm not saying a different leader would have won the election for Labour but I think it would have made a difference if the same bland campaign was run, that maybe the Conservatives wouldn't have managed a majority. 

Another big factor in the Conservative swing is that people voted for them because they disliked the SNP and thought a vote for Labour would weaken the union, the irony is that their vote has only made it more likely that the union will break.",null,0,null,1432048626,null,0,false,0,cre41eb,null,t3_36hghu,null,t1_cre41eb,null,t3_36hghu,null,null,null,1433149583,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

If Person B comes in and says they're unemployed but worked/volunteered in several different places, applied themselves and learnt new skills and networked during that time they instantly look a far more attractive proposition.

1. The bakers are opposed to gay marriage. 

That is an undeniable fact.

2. Gay marriage is 'inextricably linked' to the sexual relations of same sex couples. 

That is not a fact. It's actually a complete falsehood. How can something which does not exist in this region of the country, i.e. gay marriage,  be inextricably linked to same sex relations? 

Following from this logic **any** opposition to gay marriage would be discrimination against gay people, which is simply not the case until a court decides that the legislature is discriminating against LGBT people by not legalising gay marriage. She has no authority or remit to declare that to be the case without an actual trial relating to it.

3. The baker knew that the man was gay.

That's probably a fact from the evidence in the trial.

4. That by **opposing gay marriage** Ashers was discriminating against the client in refusing to bake his cake because he was gay.

Her judgement is essentially that they were discriminating against gay marriage and the client was gay they were therefore discriminating against the client. It's absolutely ludicrous.

If a straight person ordered that cake would they still refuse to bake it? If so they are not discriminating against the client but against the message on the cake.

If the client had attempted to buy something else would they have refused to sell them it? If not then they are not discriminating against the client but against the message on the cake.

Those are two very simple tests to see if the discrimination is against the person due to their orientation. The judge decide not to apply them and instead made the **assumption** that because the client was gay and they were refusing to bay a cake related to a gay position they were refusing service to a gay person due to their sexual orientation which is an absolutely shocking leap to make.

It's an all or nothing. Either you reject *everything* that disagrees with your views, or nothing. I haven't seen anyone else coming forward saying they were refused (Moneylenders, for example, or non-christians, or anyone who eats shellfish, etc), so it looks like an isolated case against a protected group. Therefore, it breaks equality laws.

&gt; Political freedom 

No, Political belief is not protected by equality law. All 3 examples you provided could be legally refused. That, I believe, was Ashers stance that this was a political issue rather than a personal one. However, they still refused service to a gay man. Cue controversy.

&gt; Private life freedom (which is what gay rights are included under) - Is it illegal for a Christian to refuse to print flyers supporting polygamy

No. Polygamy polygamy is illegal in the UK and therefore not protected by equality law.

null,false,JPLR,null,null,null,"Emailing a few global corporations to retract support for an international power structure like FIFA is not going to work.

1: National economies are planned around the World Cup and are often shattered by the competition's ramifications. Emails short of world leaders or U.N. officials, people with actual public accountability, are going to fall on the deafest of ears.

2: FIFA as an institution is absurdly corrupt to begin with. Do you really think they're going to pressure a whole nation to suddenly change behaviors that have obviously been practiced for decades? Of course not. And if they *tried*, global attention would be focused on FIFA's corruption, a spotlight they know they cannot keep standing in.

3: The wheels are already set in motion. The deadline has been made and international funds are set to a plan that has to be executed by an incredibly close date. To not have the stadium built on time later would be far more embarrassing as a nation than to whip workers into a frenzy now so that it is built on time. They're already behind as it is. It's not hard to see what they're going to do.

The only way to stop this sort of nonsense is to appeal directly past the heartless power structures like FIFA, and corporations that have already proven they just don't care because of how they've treated nations in the past. If they're willing to singlehandedly change a nation's law to serve beer in a stadium (a law put in place only to serve as a public safety measure), they're certainly not going to *care* about the workers.

You'd have to convince the international community as a whole to boycott this mess and FIFA on top of it. You'd have to speak to the top seeds like Germany, Brazil and the Netherlands and get them to withdraw from the the Cup entirely. Everything short of that is just naivete.

**TLDR: Corporations and FIFA couldn't care less about your emails. Pressure the soccer teams (which is to say the top teams' nations) directly to withdraw from FIFA or nothing will happen.**

And good luck with that because individual developed powers like Germany value their own national pride by far over the lost face of a third world state.

&gt; “It’s all about Aston Villa, not one particular player, I like Carles - he trains really well but when I think it’s right for him to get an opportunity he’ll get it.”

that comes from the same interview were he talked about ""icing on the cake players"" found [here.](http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2015/04/07/aston-villa-boss-tim-sherwood-addresses-carles-gils-lack-of-acti/page/1/) I hope we get to see him play against Burnley since that game doesn't really matter other than to get us on stable ground after that ludicrous display last saturday. I think that Gil will make for a great replacement for N'zogbia. Zog's old and *just* on the glamorous side of 30. I think Gil and Sinclair will fill that role. 

I so desperately want to like Sanchez, but i don't really rate him. Sure he offers some defensive contribution, but he undoes that all by carelessly giving the ball away, or losing his man in the box on corner kicks leading to goals. He's young and hopefully he (and a lot of other players in our squad) can put this season behind him and move forward. I think he's a good rotational player and would definitely like to see what he can do next year. 

As for Vlaar, the penalty he gave up against Stoke was the final nail in the coffin. He went from being our solid rock in the back to just a place holder.

Not much job hunting going on when you are forced to work as slave labour for a supermarket. 
The weird thing is, that tescos needed security guards and customers (they've lost hundreds of millions of pounds recently). These guys needed jobs and were starving, as after travel costs were deducted they were left with £150 odd quid a month to live off and couldn't afford to buy food from tescos.youre probably thinking, why the fuck aren't tescos just employing these people.

- However, the people who can enforce a director's duty is limited to the shareholders and other directors. If the shareholders and directors don't care, there's not much that can be done about a wayward director, so long as the company isn't fraudulent or trading wrongfully.

- The strict liability of the law in question. You break the equality act by the act of discrimination, and even trying hard not to discriminate won't protect you if you still manage to discriminate. If the company is found in breach of anti-discrimination law, *for whatever reason* (including being unable to find employees willing to do the work), then it's still in breach. It's the *result* of not performing services for one person that you would perform for another that is punished, not the company's *attempts*.

Well there's one of my concerns answered - shame it wasn't the answer it should be.

&gt; they do not provide food so many days he can’t afford to eat at work.

I actually thought about including something about lunches but decided it would be silly. I should have known better.

&gt; One day he was ill with a virus and needed to miss a day. He was told that “that wasn’t good enough” so he worked through his illness. If he misses a day of work he loses 1 month pay. If he misses 3 days he loses months of pay.

Oh look, there are the stupid fucking jobcentre sanctions I was talking about.

Honestly, I know people will say ""this was just one placement"" or whatever, but even if that were true, it's one too many. The whole thing is really open to abuse when we're talking about private companies instead of charities (who I'm sure are also capable of being unfair, but as many of them focus on helping out the poor and underprivileged you'd hope they would be better about it in general)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I had began to get into Soccer(or Football) when I watched my 1st World Cup in 2010. I can truly see why many people refer to soccer as ""The Beautiful Game"". When Iniesta found the back of the net, the roaring crowd that ensued gave me goosebumps and propelled my focus into ""The Beautiful Game"". Soccer has a huge influence over people in both good and bad ways. The good ways included the United States bowing out of the World Cup after an emotional match against the winners, being Belgium, and as a result, The United States' Soccer League, Major League Soccer (or MLS), received a boom of supporters, and as a result, the MLS starting to develop and expand faster through positive support and media. However, the bad ways are hidden in the shadow of the popular sport. Recently, during the 2nd Leg of the Copa Libertadores, River Plate players were sprayed with an irritant, as they were arriving at the pitch, by a Boca Juniors fan who's motivation may have been to provide an unfair advantage for Boca Juniors, who were losing at the time. The result of this action, taken up by CONMEBOL, was to kick out Boca Juniors out of the tournament and enforce sanctions upon them. It was clear was CONMEBOL wanted, they wanted a fair game and to punish anyone who disrespected ""The Beautiful Game"". However, ""The Beautiful Game"" bring fans of their country and club closer together, it creates a community of strong nationalistic feeling to their Country as they enter the World Cup. 

I don't see this in Qatar. I don't see people flocking to the stadiums built by tears and blood. I don't see positive support for the 2022 World Cup, as it is already receiving lots of negative support and media. 

I have been made aware of a popular entry on reddit.com, a blog that logs 162,000,000 unique visitors per month, of a recent issues regarding Qatari migrant labor and the imprisonment of a BBC journalist attempting to report on it. The horrible conditions that caused 188 World Cup migrant workers to die and thousands of others to continue to work in must be addressed. Human rights are very important to keeping the peace in our world today. I am campaigning against the 2022 World Cup, as it has disappointed me and many others, that Qatar has failed to uphold the prestigious image of Soccer and the World Cup in our World today. 

I urge you to please take action against supporting the dissolving of human rights in Qatar. To take action against the actions threatening many fans, including me, from enjoying a great tournament. To take action to protect the image of ""The Beautiful Game"".

Thank you for your individual attention,
(My name)

Alternate systems do it differently. The most common example is PR (I'm not a fan of it myself in some cases).

Under Proportional Representation, rather than a community voting for an mp, the entire country will vote, and the votes will be divided between the parties, and then thru some political magic I don't know about specifically, mp's will be assigned.

For example, in this election, tories would have gotten 37% of mps, since they got 37% of the vote.

I'm no expert on this clearly, but that is one way this could happen. I recommend reading up on alternate voting systems, first past the post is god awful and perpetuates 2 party systems.

What he doesn't realise or care about is he had a big part in our poor performances too, and as the likes of Carragher have said, he hasn't earned a thing, but acts like moving is the answer.

We had some great opportunities to win trophies, he is just as accountable as the rest of the squad for the failure to achieve it. 

I don't buy into this playing him out of position is another motive. It guaranteed him a start and he gave interviews saying he was happy to play there for the experience and for the team. Suddenly when he's kicking up a fuss it becomes an issue? Not buying it.

The club clearly will invest in strikers this summer, and he hasn't even waited until the end of the season to stick his opinion in our back to the media. 

Footballers with any dignity do not cry to the tabloids in the manner he has done this year. There is no excusing it even if we talked about how much he was being offered, like near enough every other club does too. Why isn't Milner crying to the press about city leaking his 165k a week contract? Or what about De Gea with United saying they've offered him 200k?

The Sterling camp is excuse-mongering and publicly trying to force their own agenda. I have 0 respect for it.

&gt;More than three decades later, through Major and Blair and Brown and Cameron, that proportion has kept on rising. Now 38% of working-age households rely on taxpayers to pay their way. Think about all those tax credits for low-paid work, those exemptions for people earning too little even to be taxed.

I think firstly I should point out I am not 100% happy with how this data is presented in this piece, by only saying ""working-age households"" I feel that could be led to include households completely out of work? I would love to see the data showing how many households where one or more of working age are in full-time employment and still fall into this bracket of needing state intervention to live on. The target number should be zero. 

A lot of the Conservative rhetoric of late has been around 'Hard Working Families' &amp; 'Strivers' but if this article is true (like I said, not 100% sure on the data being used) then you can work as hard as you like but still fall short. This is an important topic since if we admit we do not want people in work to starve, go cold, or merely subsist as the most basic levels (I do believe people are not machines and that some form of cultural participation should be considered a necessity) then we admit that people are simply not being paid enough. This is in some part already admitted because we have the Tax-Credit system - i.e. our tax system admits some people are not paid enough money to meet some basic standard (again not sure what this is defined against so not sure what this standard is). 

The other issue I take with this is that it is a form of Corporate Welfare, businesses do not need to pay a wage that is enough to live on because Welfare (i.e. Taxpayers) will pick up the slack. I think this is not addressed enough when talking about this - we are using the Tax Credit system to cheapen the labour cost to businesses; is this something we are ok with? It was something that struck me about the dialogue around the scandal a few years ago when people on out-of-work benefits were being made to work for places like Tesco &amp; Poundland. People were complaining it was Slave Labour while other people replied they were being paid so of course it wasn't, and anyway people should be willing to do whatever job they needed to; put away your pride and stack shelves. Well no it wasn't Slavery &amp; yes sometimes you have to put pride aside to put food on the table, these are fair points. How about that Tesco &amp; Poundland are private companies being handed free labour they would otherwise have had to pay for? How about that Welfare comes out of Taxes we all pay then perhaps there are better uses for that money than giving a hand-out to Businesses? I didn't see that point discussed all that much; and it is still relevant when we look at this.

A poorly written article it may be, but it is a discussion that needs to be had nevertheless.",null,0,null,1432053118,null,0,false,0,cre6tnl,null,t3_36hc0h,null,t1_cre6tnl,null,t3_36hc0h,null,null,null,1433150895,null,6,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

I mean, I doubt they're really all that interested in me (I'm not paranoid about it); they'd just be scooping up my data in a big ol' net alongside everyone else's and then probably never looking at it for anything unless an algorithm decides that I'm suspicious. But you know what, so long as I'm within the law I have every right to do the kinds of things that an algorithm might think is suspicious, without worrying about some misguided watch-list trigger going off. 

When everything is watched and analysed and combed through looking for ""suspicious things"", the false positives can destroy lives (in terms of headlines, think ""tragic police shooting in case of mistaken identity"" or ""man accused of downloading child pornography... turned out not to be, but is still fired and his good name tarnished""), and the knock-on effect is that everyone gradually gets incrementally more cautious about what they type into Google, or what kind of jokes they make on social media, just in case Big Brother is watching, and I don't want to live in that world.

I also have perfectly good reason to want to secure the rights of those who legitimately do have something they need to keep private, including from the government and the intelligence agencies - activists, journalists, whistleblowers, protesters, outspoken dissenters, opposition politicians... people who make themselves inconvenient for the powerful in general. 

I suppose it's true that if they've led entirely blameless lives then there will be nothing to smear or blackmail them with, but I don't think it ought to be the case that you have to be a perfect saint to ever be politically active (including being beyond reproach in even the worst possible interpretation of innocent actions, by someone with a motivated interest in slandering you).",null,0,null,1432053130,null,0,1432054114,0,cre6tx9,null,t3_36i3vq,null,t1_cre6tx9,null,t3_36i3vq,null,null,null,1433150899,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

Reconciling economic, social and environmental goals is always challenging. 

Although I still hold that to create a meaningfully sustainable economy it is necessary ditch capitalism. What we have currently is a global economy built on resource extraction and consumption. By its very nature seeks to grow and accumulate. In this sense our economics are diametrically opposed to a sustainable existence. So maybe nothing short of radical social transformation will fix the problem. At the very least we need a fundamental reorganisation of the capitalist markets to include externalities like climate change. 

P.S. Yes, I could be underestimating the flexibility that exists within capitalism to think there can be no significant moves towards addressing the immediate climate crisis.

I'm sure he was happy with it when he was solely played as a striker for the few weeks he did that.. but then Rodgers started fucking him around, playing him 2 games as a striker, 2 on the wing, 2 as a striker etc.. how the fuck can a player be consistent or happy if a manager does that?

However when the club leaked the £150k negotiation to the media do you not remember all the shit Sterling received on Twitter/here etc? the only reason to leak that was to make everyone think he's a money whore and to ""bully"" him into accepting a lesser contract.

The club needs to start treating its players better, that's all there is to it. There have been multiple cases where the club has been too slow with contracts now and also the retarded leaks are damaging the club.

I personally dislike Robin Hood taxes such as a Mansion-Tax since I feel it unfairly punitive on success rather than dealing with the issue directly (it is also true just because you are 'property rich' does not mean you are 'cash rich'). My favourite options include taxing empty properties, a complete restructuring of the tax brackets to account for the massive rises in income rates since its inception, &amp; my all time favourite : a tax on the % difference between what the top &amp; bottom incomes of a company. This would be the most difficult as it would need to be set in such a way that it could stop CEO's hiding behind shell companies etc, but I like the idea that we can both celebrate success so long as we understand the human cost at the other end of the scale.

null,false,sosr,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire in London,null,"Ok, I'm looking at the full text of the judgment now, but here's what I'd say to you on your points:

&gt;Gay marriage is 'inextricably linked' to the sexual relations of same sex couples.

&gt; How can something which does not exist in this region of the country, i.e. gay marriage, be inextricably linked to same sex relations?

I don't see your point. It doesn't matter if gay marriage is allowed or not there. The claimants support the cause for gay marriage. By your logic taking things that aren't yours cannot be inextricably linked to theft, as theft is illegal. 

&gt;Following from this logic any opposition to gay marriage would be discrimination against gay people

That isn't what the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 is concerned with. The issue is the provision of a service:

&gt;Regulation 5  Goods Facilities or services
 
&gt;(1)     It is unlawful for any person concerned with the provision (for payment or not) of goods, facilities or services to the public or a section of the public to discriminate against a person who seeks to obtain or use those goods, facilities or services –
 
&gt;(a)        by refusing or deliberately omitting to provide him with any of them; or ...

The regulations do not prevent you from being opposed to gay marriage.

&gt;Her judgement is essentially that they were discriminating against gay marriage and the client was gay they were therefore discriminating against the client.

and

&gt;If the client had attempted to buy something else would they have refused to sell them it? If not then they are not discriminating against the client but against the message on the cake.

It is not only unlawful to discriminate against people because they are something, but also to discriminate because of their beliefs (Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998). The jump that you are suggesting wasn't made and didn't need to be made.

&gt;That by opposing gay marriage Ashers was discriminating against the client in refusing to bake his cake because he was gay.

No, the opposition to gay marriage was not the issue on its own. The issue was that they refused to provide a service on that basis. 

&gt;If a straight person ordered that cake would they still refuse to bake it? If so they are not discriminating against the client but against the message on the cake.



That argument was used at trial and was rejected. The judge assessed the relevant case law and stated:

&gt;In applying the reasoning from the authorities cited, it is my view that, if a comparator is required, the correct comparator is a heterosexual person placing an order for a cake with the graphics either “Support Marriage” or “Support Heterosexual Marriage.”

Next you said:

&gt;Those are two very simple tests to see if the discrimination is against the person due to their orientation.

The judge addressed both of those arguments and provided authority for why they should be rejected.

&gt;made the assumption that because the client was gay and they were refusing to bay a cake related to a gay position they were refusing service to a gay person due to their sexual orientation which is an absolutely shocking leap to make.

The judge found that they are not separate issues. She said:

I'm writing to encourage you to revoke your sponsorship of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Even in the face of clear human rights violations, intense public pressure, and four thousand deaths, FIFA has done little to effectively address abusive and exploitative labor being used to build the stadiums and infrastructure for the event.  Rewarding FIFA with continued sponsorship not only encourages their abuse, bribery, and corruption but suggests your company operates under the same abusive and corrupt policies.

Since money is, obviously, the only language FIFA speaks, I'm asking that you redirect your sponsorship dollars to more honorable events.

So given that I don't think it's so inconceivable that the elites ruling might include a few gays who now wish to use their financial/political heft to promote homosexuality over what's normal and natural. It's like revenge, except in the west at least, they are doing it at the expense of the majority, or normal people, and pissing them off.

The propaganda these days quite explicitly tries to promote it as absolutely normal, as if to brainwash children into thinking half of all people are gay. It's untrue, it's wrong, it's disgusting, it's unnecessary. It goes past its original aim of just going for tolerance.

Other examples. Posters on the tube referring to dead (because only alive ones can complain) straight celebrities as ""gay role models"". Show hosts being hired/promoted mainly because they're gay (see Clare Balding, John Barrowman, amongst others. People who have no likeability whatsoever but are just being spammed on TV anyway). Excessive advertising for that (fucking awful) show ""Vicious"" on ITV. A 2nd season despite it's 1st being an epic failure. No doubt it's awful because it was made not to entertain, but to inculcate.

Last season, maybe. This season hasn't been good for him. Look at it from his perspective. He's the one fans are demanding goals from. He's the one put as a sole striker when he's a 20 y/o being played out of position. He's the one fans go crazy with insults towards when he makes a mistake any other 20 y/o will make. Just look at Ibe. The kid constantly makes mistakes yet even then people say he looked positive. No one on our team is scoring due to the formation / system, yet Sterling is taking more of the blame for that than anyone else. I can see why he'd be unsettled. He's trying his best, but a 20 y/o vs. any PL defense is a tough ask. Sure he's selfish, but people expect goals from him and that's what he's trying to do.

As for the whole contract thing, /u/nikcub made a great post about how poorly LFC treated Sterling:

Dear Sirs

I am writing regarding your sponsorship of the Qatar World Cup. I am very concerned that a leading company like yours would sponsor an event that is so obviously corrupt, unsuitable as a venue, and guilty of terrible mistreatment of migrant workers.

Although I love football dearly, I will not watch this World Cup. I have also decided that I am boycotting all major sponsors' products until such a time that the venue is changed. I will also place my opinions of your sponsorship on social media whenever possible.

As a major sponsor, I believe that you can influence FIFA to take the World Cup away from Qatar. I think you have a duty to either require this to happen or withdraw your sponsorship. I hope you will consider the many people who share my opinion and press for an immediate change of venue.

I guess if we actually make it to the group stage we can reassess, but by that time we will have a better understanding of our situation in the league, already played a bunch of games in Europe (and won them if we got to the group), and can see how our health is holding up and if we should prioritize it or not.

One complaint I have was that I felt it was more of a family drama set in war times rather than a good history lesson of what took place in the war. That's all well and good but then don't call it 1864 - because that reference is all war to the Danes.

I think the first episode is a bit scattered in that the skipping between now and then is chopping things up more than tying things together - but that gets better later on. And of course there is alot of character introduction which makes it somewhat tedious.

Watch episodes 1+2 in one go. Bow out if you don't like it after the 3rd, by then I'd say it's fully set up.

To me, the most interesting character is Johan Larsen (fellow soldier but older and wiser than the brothers), doesn't appear until ep 3.

The first link is about someone who called Cameron 'a conceited prick'.  Not really equivalent, is it?

The second link is about people facing jail for tweets.  Again - is that really the same issue?  

The third link is about people sending death threats to Sue Perkins and the commenter you linked to is of the opinion that the best strategy is to ignore them (i.e. don't feed the trolls).  And he was heavily downvoted for making that comment.  

So, forgive me, but I'm not yet seeing any evidence that people are reacting with the 'pfft it's only a joke' argument.   Yes, I have seen people claim that online death threats are generally not credible or should be ignored, but is that really the same thing as the claim that they're just jokes?  I don't think so.

Of the 37 games that Tottenham, sixth in the Premier League, made in the competition, Paulinho took part in only 15. In just two, the Brazilian played the full 90 minutes, having added so far only one assist and no goals scored. For a former teammate, however, the steering wheel is just another victim of the London team.

""It's the club (the blame). Certainly would not recommend to anyone. It's not just buy and wait surrender, have to help in adaptation. William went to Chelsea and is yielding but could be leaning against Tottenham,"" he said Goalkeeper Gomes, now at Watford, vice-champion of the second division, the ESPN.com.br.

Gomes talks as very hurt by Tottenham. Team player between 2008 and 2014, the match started very well his career in England and played including one Champions League, made not very usual in the team. From the 2011/2012 season, however, he had problems with coach Harry Redknapp and entered into friction with the club.

""If it was the other coach, my career would continue at Tottenham. If it were another club, let me follow my life elsewhere. It was disrespectful to my career. I had proposed Hoffenheim (time for which he served borrowed in 2013), but demanded 5 million pounds to release me. I never gave any trouble and so I decided to wait until the end of my contract, ""he reported the player, which revealed a query Santos in January this year, when preferred to follow in England.

For Gomes, the Tottenham disregard for new players is not just to Brazilians. ""They paid 28 million pounds in the Soldier and not surrendered. Has Lamela, who was a great promise of Europe, and today you watch games Tottenham and looks like he can not play ball.""

Paulinho complete next weekend his second season in England, with reserve team and having lost ground in the national team. After starting the World Cup as a starter and go to the bench in the quarterfinals, the steering wheel was no longer called after the World Cup. A departure from Tottenham and a return to Brazilian football are speculated at all times.

The whole team has, especially our forwards. I'm not going to single out Sterling when the whole team has been disappointing.

Maybe he didn't reject the contract for money, but instead because he wants to leave. He said in that BBC interview he would have accepted a 70k/wk contract last year, but with how LFC have handled the situation, he's looking at other options. He also wants to play with other quality players, yet LFC haven't signed any and we've lost Suarez, losing Gerrard, and Sturridge has been out most of the season. I'm inclined to believe Sterling when he says it isn't about him being greedy.

He's got more goals and assists than most of the team. What more do we really expect from a 20y/o? That's why I compare him to Ibe.

This process is repeated until one candidate has more than 50% of the vote.

AV is slightly better than FPTP in that it ensures that the person who wins does so on a majority rather than plurality. However it is not proportional because if the MP wins on say 51% of the vote, the other 49% of the voters are effectively unrepresentative.

A PR based system usually has multiple seats available per constituency (constituencies are usually larger to compensate). Some method is used to tally up the votes for each candidate/party (depending on the particular PR system) and then the seats are assigned according to the proportion of the votes.

This is a case where liberal rights collide and the difficulty is balancing the two. Let's ignore the two specific pieces of Northern Irish legislation in the cake case for the moment just for simplicity of argument: 

You mention freedom of expression, in this case not being compelled to express a viewpoint. On the other side of the argument is the right to manifest your religious beliefs. How do you go about deciding which is more important? 

I don't agree with you on the custom tailored entities thing. One aim of anti-discrimination laws is to protect minorities. You're saying that the law should only apply to standard products. Imagine the majority view in a society is that Buddhists should be banned from voting. A Buddhist group is concerned and wants to produce a leaflet outlining the argument against this. The printer won't print it. They have a right to freedom of expression, correct?

In your way the person is protected from discrimination, but the expression of his views are not. He has a right to be gay, but he doesn't have a right to be heard in his argument for gay rights.

There's also the issue of what you call artistic input. How do you decide whose input that is? In the cake case it's arguable the artistic input was minor if there was any at all on the bakers' part, as the design was the claimant's idea. The claimant said I want Bert and Ernie and for it to say 'Support gay marriage'.  The baker displays considerable skill sure, but he is basically a human printer.

In fairness this usually comes from using a definition of racist that ties it into a system of power. In effect the argument is that a person of colour can be bigoted on the grounds of race but that doesn't make them racist (although presumably Arabs in Saudi Arabia could be racist against non Arabs). Obviously this hits the problem that most people define racism as discrimination on the grounds of race regardless of who is doing it and who is on the receiving end.

I'm sorry, but I can't find any articles detailing the existence of such cliffs in the UK welfare system, however, [The current Jobseeker’s Allowance system means you need to work 16 hours or more to come off benefit and see a real increase in your income.
However, for those remaining on benefit and working less than 16 hours, anything they earn over £5 if they are a single person, slightly more if they are a lone parent or disabled, will result in their benefit being reduced pound for pound.
This means someone over 25 can’t work for even one full hour per week at minimum wage without seeing an instantaneous fall in benefits.
Different benefits contain different cliff edges - arbitrary points at which the level of earnings or hours tips the balance resulting in total loss of income.](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/welfare-reform-and-flexible-working)",null,0,null,1432061120,null,0,false,0,crebwq6,null,t3_33ekkk,null,t1_crebwq6,null,t3_33ekkk,null,null,null,1433153303,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

My employer has fucked my last two wages. I'm salaried with no bonuses or overtime so there's no reason this should happen but because it's happened at the dawn of a new tax year, I have no idea what I'm to expect in my bank on payday. I've been underpaid two months in a row.

This has been hugely stressful to me as I'm due to move house and have taken on debts which I deemed to be manageable based on my salary even with room for a little saving.

In 2011 when I was a nipper on JSA/HB I had to pay my rent shortfall and all bills from my measly ~£55 p/w JSA. I was on card payments for both gas and electricity and frequently went into the emergency allowance for leccy all year round and gas in the winter. This meant I was charged double for the measly £5 emergency gas-leccy when I went to top up again so paying £15 put £5 on the meter.

When it got warm enough that the pipes wouldn't freeze I said goodbye to gas. My diet was almost exclusively made up of the cheapest rice I could find and 2-3 days without food was an unremarkable annoyance.

I struggled on, found a job, and have been in gainful employment paying taxes since. I've more than repaid the benefits I received in N.I. alone.

I can't imagine throwing full time unpaid forced labour into that mix. I've done lots of volunteeering in my life (from working in a charity shop during my time on JSA to advising a national charity on employment law and helping to organise speakers for a conference). I found it extremely rewarding because I'd chosen to do it for free. When I was back in full time employment I chose not to claim travel expenses I was entitled to because I thought the money would do more good if it went to our service users than to me.

The most important thing is choice. I chose to work for free for non-profits and felt good about it. If I were forced to do so, when living in absolute poverty I think I don't even want to imagine what I might have done.

As to why I like the idea of a World Cup there, firstly it's not a Qatari World Cup, it's a Middle Eastern World Cup. For the first time, Arabs and Iranians will be at a World Cup in overwhelming numbers, mixing with people from around the world, as well as with each other. That can only be good for the region.

I also see the sport of Football as the only institution that is both intensely tribal  yet also has a genuine global community. It has tremendous powers for good in the world.

Aesthetically, okay so there's no space for grass or large beds, but a few pot plants at the very least? Some kind of hedging for a windbreak, privacy and a habitat for birds, instead of fencing. Perhaps a creeper or a climbing plant over the porch? Surely people can find the time for those things. We used to be nation of gardeners, I think it's a shame to leave that tradition behind. If enough people on a street make the effort, a little of the keeping up with the joneses doesn't hurt either, if the end result is greener, better drained and friendlier to wildlife. Ultimately I blame construction companies and building regulations for totally neglecting gardens - build a home with green space and people will cherish it. It's awful to witness these new builds crammed in with front steps practically on the pavement.

null,false,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,null,"Well, the workfare scheme has been running for years and many for profit organisations are recipients of this forced labour. But that is not the point, the point is forcing people to do 30 hours work for such a pitiful wage and then making the scheme open ended rather than for a set 4 week time period. This is unacceptable, they need to either increase the benefits to ~~£5.71~~ minimum wage*30 hours, or reduce the forced hours down to around 10, otherwise this is purely exploitation.

The problem that people forget is that work actually increases your outgoings. £57 a week is really fucking difficult to live on to begin with. Now imagine having to factor in travel costs to and from work 5 days a week. Then factor in additional lunch costs every day (I personally find making a sandwich for a packed lunch costs me more than being able to boil some pasta at home, by around 40-50p per day). 

If its physical work, then factor in that you need more food to sustain yourself throughout the day because you are exerting more energy. Factor in the additional electricity costs of having to wash and iron your uniform (Assuming you change out of it when you get home) and the [additional wear and tear](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/36azoo/) to your shoes requiring them to be replaced more frequently. 

Then factor in the opportunity cost of all those paid jobs you no longer have time to apply for that you will have missed.

People in work on low incomes already find it soul destroying when they get home from work and can't relax because they know the money they earned barely covers their bills. A lot of redditors in these comments (Some of which inevitably fall into that bracket) seem to be happy that some people should be forced to work just as hard for 1/4 of the money. Its fucking outrageous, how are they supposed to make a living if they earn next to nothing and have no time or means to look for other opportunities? May as well put them in a work house because it amounts to the same thing.

I thought the way Friedel performed in 2011/2012 pretty much justified the decision Harry made. Maybe overall Gomes will win you at least as many points as he loses you, but predictability and consistency are incredibly important for a goalkeeper. Friedel in his old age liked to stay on his line when the box was crowded, but at least everyone in the ground KNEW that's what he'd do. 

I think Sczndkzndfkzlndfny at Arsenal is actually a pretty similar type of player , but honestly he's probably better than Gomes was overall for us, and he's still been dropped. 

I do second guess it sometimes though. A consistent 7/10 keeper is a good thing to have, but when your club needs to overperform to reach its goals maybe Gomes was a good fit. 2/10 one day but 11/10 the next. I'm not sure we would have qualified in 09/10 with someone like Friedel. The saves that Gomes made in the games down the stretch when we beat Arsenal Chelsea and City were absurd.

Well, if you look at the group, there is a white/black guy as well. Something similar happened with a prostitution racket in Slough; loads of Muslims/Pakistanis, a couple of Sikhs and a couple of white guys. 

Speaking as a Sikh myself, grooming isn't really that prevalent in our culture both in the UK and India. Not to trivialise the issue but I don't think we're the main problem here (be that due to religion or culture), apart from a small minority of disgusting chancers. 

If I had to guess, Sikhs' conduct and relative prosperity in England has possibly owed to a religion which is perhaps more modern than the 3 Abrahamic Religions leading to a more liberal culture. The religion tends not to lead to the kind of cultural divide that makes some of these grooming gangs pop up.

&gt; However the majority of the names appear to be muslim.

This is the key point, I think, although we can narrow it down further than 'Muslim'.

Whenever a so-called 'Asian' grooming racket is found out, it's chock-full of Muslim names, which is not a coincidence. This sort of thing seems to be a bigger problem in young (probably sexually repressed) Muslims than in other religious groups.

Again, I'd actually narrow the grooming issue down further than just 'Muslim' as that is lazy generalisation, but that's a separate topic which people have already touched on.

My thoughts, in summary, are that this is a specific cultural issue which can often be exacerbated by religious influence and chancers (of all races and creeds) joining in to feed their lust at the expense of the vulnerable.",null,0,null,1432063017,null,0,1432063262,0,cred4er,null,t3_36fawa,null,t1_cred4er,null,t1_crdw6dv,null,null,null,1433153875,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

&gt; He would have signed last year when we almost won the league, now he sees the first signs of trouble he is off.

That's how it goes for selling teams. Sure we'd all love another loyal player like Gerrard, but that's incredibly rare. Most players are going to go where they'll get paid well and have a better chance of winning. Suarez did the same. ""You can be a starter and maybe if you work REALLY hard we might win something!"" is less of a selling point than people in this sub want to believe.

&gt; He was offered 70k sept/oct few months into the season why didnt he sign? Does it seem implausible that club was busy with transfer business and wanted to deal with player contracts later, dont forget Sterling had 3 years on his contract.

Because he was already thinking about leaving? Because he wanted to see how the season went with the new signings first before committing to a new deal? He's said it's not about the money, and he's turned down bigger contracts. Seems he might be serious about it not being about the money.

&gt; Sterling thinks he is a superstar, fine I dont have a problem with it then he should have the aptitude to work for it and take the criticism when he doesnt live up to the expectations.

Sterling is not a superstar. I don't recall him ever saying he was. I don't recall him ever thinking he was. That's merely the expectations the fans have placed on him.

null,false,wanson,lfc68,,null,"&gt;I don't Arsenal sticking around to the #2 position next season unless they make some big moves.

Which they will do! Because of all the reasons I mentioned earlier. Over the last 10-20 years they have put themselves in a financially sound position, so they can now afford to drop 45m on a player and pay them 150-200k a week. Before signing Ozil, Arsenal had never paid more than 15m for a player. Now they are in a position to sign world class players and they will.
 
And players will want to go to Arsenal because they know they are going to be in the CL, play attractive football for a very well respected manager, know they will be paid what they (think they) deserve and because they will be living in London, one of the best  cities in the world for a 20 something millionaire to live in!

We can't compete with that. Either we get a sugar daddy or buckle-up for a long hard ride. We can get back into the elite the hard way but it will take time and patience.

Most people manage to look for work while employed full time. I'm not convinced by that argument.

EDIT: To be clear, though, for my part I consider it immoral to require a number of hours that makes the net hourly pay below minimum wage. I'm fine with requiring healthy, able people to work for unemployment benefits, but if we do so, we should either pay them properly, or set the hours proportional to to the benefit received. Otherwise it is nothing but exploitation of a deprived group. But 30 hours is not something I can see as a problem in and of itself. 30 hours at the indicated hourly wage, on the other hand, stinks.

Perhaps I would also suggest that such a scheme shouldn't simply stop benefits if the choice is *not* to do the work, but perhaps lower it.

I heard a rumour that he was a bit lazy in training (didn't track back, or run enough), and that that is the reason he was left out of the team. What is even more amazing is that his place is occupied by N'Zogbia, the laziest lump of a player I've ever seen at Villa Park. He's been here for almost 4 seasons now, and he's done absolutely fuck all until Sherwood got here. It's not going to last, and the sooner we get rid of that waste of space, the better. 

Sanchez: He is a liability. An accident waiting to happen. He does so many good things, but just as Okore, you know that at some point he is going to make an absolutely retarded mistake. And if the opposition knows that, they can punish us severely. He does have potential though, so I wouldn't mind giviing him one more season to prove himself, but if he keeps making the same mistakes he's got to go. He will make a cheap and decent back-up. 

Vlaar: Just like Sanchez he is an accident waiting to happen. I can probably count on one hand the times he's made a decent clearance. He always seems to lump the ball into the opposition's feet in a dangerous position. He makes less mistakes than Sanchez, but being a defender these mistakes are more visible, and often punished harder. He is overrated, and wants to be overpaid as well. Let him go to United or wherever he thinks he deserves to play, and let him rot in their 'bomb squad', as he will inevitably be dropped from the startin XI, and then from the matchday squad. There were some rumourd about him going back to the Netherlands, which probably wouldn't be a bad idea, as that is closer to his level.

Secondly, you have every right to be pissed off with her and claim back your money. She treated you like shit and there is no harm in her learning that there are consequences to treating someone like that.

Get her to agree to a repayment schedule in writing.  Get her to sign it. Even if it is for a very small amount, at least you have evidence that the loan exists, if you should ever take it to a small claims court. I think £10 a month is a derisory amount and you should negotiate a better settlement than that, but something that she at least has a chance of paying off. Even though a verbal contract is enforceable, proving it exists is a lot more difficult. This is why I suggest you get something in writing. If she defaults (as it seems likely she will), you have what you need.

It's a tough call whether you should ever take it to court, if she defaults. You have to decide whether the money is worth the hassle.

Wimmer at 7, Thauvin (not really, but someone of his caliber) at 10, and Ings/Austin at 10.  That still gives you another couple to pick up some Levy youth bargain bin choices.

The owners are really big on the youth players making it through, and mansour gets what he wants most of the time. Everything is in lopes' favour really, he just needs to take the chances he'll get. 

Iheanacho also just said he doesn't want to go on loan, so I think we'll see him next year occasionally too, in the same way Pozo got half a dozen games, Nacho will get the same and with Dzeko and Jovetic heading out, he might end up 4th choice. 

My only worry is that with Pellegrini leaving next summer he has no real incentive to play the youth players.

However you are currently the citizen of a first world nation and can probably be lumped into the western european group of whites. Current global dynamics put you higher up the power scale. South Africa is also still very much white dominated in terms of power. 

The white groups you probably could make a case for at the likes of the Blancs Matignon and the Confederados. However by conventional standards such groups tend to be pretty racist.

&gt;Or have we take into account all historical and global imbalances in power as well?

I think that usually the current situation is considered enough.

Well Scotland in the Declaration of Arbroath did explicitly base part of its claim to nationhood on the genocide of the Picts (don't worry there is no evidence of it actually happening). Irish are of course a further complication since until fairly recently they wouldn't really have been considered white.

Cosmetically she's rough as arse since the previous owner seems to have brush painted everything with Hammerite whilst she was still together. And I also had to replace the chain and sprockets. Oh and the spark plugs are a bitch. But she can still shift, and she's beautifully balanced.

Truth be told I'm more excited than I should be for next week. I'll run her through the summer then sort all the niggles and cosmetics in the winter as she won't be out in any more British winters, she's earned her semi-retirement.

Admittedly, the UK is still a net payer when it comes to the money running straight through Brussels (albeit a minor one), the trade volume gained by being a member of the EU moves quite more money into the UK, more than in most other EU countries. But, of course, this money does not end up in your pockets - most of it ends up in the ""City"" and similar places.

I don't know if this will comfort you, but the method is the same as in other European countries - the EU is just a way to move whats left in the peoples pocket towards those who already have more than enough. Only the numbers differ.

The objections so far (that the reduction of say, £90-£72, which is what I threw out as a ballpark figure after asking parents/siblings) have come from 2 of the 3, will probably need to discuss more, shouldn't be too much of an issue to be honest. I still think a reduction in that region is feasible, and they are being a tad irrational, but should be settled easily tbh.

Only thing I wanted to ask, for the allocation of the other rooms what would you say is fairest? I think one person already has their heart set on a particular.

One important reason for considering the former is that it aligns the incentives of government and job seekers.

If you make job seekers ""cheap labour"", whether for local councils, charities or businesses, you create an incentive for a lot of people to not worry so much about getting these people into ""proper"" jobs that are actually profitable without government ""subsidies"". On the other hand the more expensive you make job seekers to the government, the stronger the incentive and pressure to put proper efforts into creation of permanent jobs.  In my opinion, the cost of job seekers should be made to substantially outstrip the cost of measures to increase the number of available jobs on a per person basis: It should be ""profitable"" for government to invest in all kinds of new programs to stimulate job growth.

Ie that you can't disassociate the support for direct marriage from sexual orientation, because it is strongly associated with that orientation, so amounts to indirect discrimination.

I can see some justification for this.  Eg. you could imagine something like refusing to bake a cake with a message supporting a particular football team - which happens to have supporters predominantly of a particular religion or ethnicity (eg. Rangers of Celtic).  The fact that it's discriminating predominantly against that religion means it's effectively indirect discrimination.  I'm not that convinced by this myself, but I think it's a reasonable argument.

Another point is that the [law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1998/3162/article/3/made) in question does actually explicitly cover political opinion, which is spelled out in the argument starting on page 16.

Instead of having a machine put the laces on, have them do it instead. The reason it's not competitive if they're paid would be that a machine could lace 100 shoes an hour, but the guys 50. Say there were 10 guys and they were lacing the boots at £8 an hour, that's a cost of £80 an hour just for laces. Say they work 8 hours a day for 250 days, that's £80 x 8 x 250 = £160k a year. That has to be worked into the cost of the boots. Our competitors have a machine that laces the boots and laces twice as many a year. They can sell their boots far cheaper than we can because we're not making boots at market costs...if we pay them.

Jamie's quote on Sterling not showing up against Villa was true but unfair at the same time. This season Raheem has been better than people give him credit for due to a drop in form (cut him slack he's 20).

He's had plenty to show he can be a big game winner:

- A goal and an assist in our first game versus Southampton.

- Late winner against Burnley

- Goal against Tottenham (away)

- 2 assists in our win against City

- Capitol one cup equaliser versus Chelsea

- Opener against Man City last season

- 2 goals in our 5-1 over Arsenal

We were calling him Raheem the dream only 3 freaking months ago. It wasn't for no reason he is a sensational youth who is getting crapped on. So much is happening that we don't know and are getting angry about and the media points the finger at Raheem and we join the witch hunt.

I still feel that the opportunities that he has had to play, he hasn't looked nearly good enough to be in our squad, let alone starting 11.

I've never liked Sterling, I think he's a great player in the middle of the park and when driving towards goal but he could beat 4 players and then not know what to do. There are occasions when he'll look lost as soon as he's in the final third or when he's through on goal. One game this season that sums it up is Liverpool at home to Newcastle, he missed 3 easy chances that game despite some incredible build up play. Even against us he had a moment of brilliance going past Dave like he wasn't there then he just runs the ball out of play. 

Sure, Jose turned Joe Cole into a more evolved player and has done to a similar extent with Hazard (in terms of more effort defensively) but I don't think the money/effort for Sterling would be worth it.

&gt;nonsense like 'manspreading'

I've never even heard of this before and I spend a fair amount of time talking to feminists and in feminist circles. ""Mainsplaining"" is used rarely, but only tongue in cheek and I'd criticise anyone directing it at someone as an insult. I feel like you might be just hearing a very vocal and extreme minority. The shirt thing was a ridiculous overreaction, but I think the reaction from most feminists was just a sigh. I'd partly blame the media for fanning the flames to manufacture drama. [Lauren Faust](https://twitter.com/fyre_flye/status/533503115707023360) is a fairly prominent feminist I remember having a sensible take on it at the time. Don't know which cartoonists apparently deserve to be murdered though. Anyone who says anyone deserves to be murdered isn't someone I'd want to associate with. Whatever the cartoonist did is irrelevant, but [I agree with Neil Gaiman that freedom and speech and expression are undeniable however objectionable something is.](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/12/why-defend-freedom-of-icky-speech.html).

&gt;no systems dedicated to perpetuating racial discrimination

Of course not, but there are systems which are much harsher on some racial groups than others. An obvious example at the moment would be the police in parts of the US. That's all I meant by it. Bear in mind that when ""positive discrimination"" you describe happens it's only intended as a temporary measure to address that. Even when we have equal treatment it may act to maintain existing inequalities rather than address them, if those inequalities are bad enough. Sort of like running loads of people to the other side of a boat to stop it overbalancing, you're not going to leave the distribution uneven when it levels out.

Edit: I'll read the article you linked when I get a chance, thanks. From a quick scan it looks like something I'm going to sympathise with, ""lazy"" is a fair criticism sometimes.

I know that. But my point is that the mere fact that a man with such a great achievement would be so terribly humiliated by ingrates without any accomplishments suggests that the influence of these extremists is increasing.

&gt; I feel like you might be just hearing a very vocal and extreme minority. 

Naturally. I'm not at all suggesting that these views are mainstream. The problem is that this fringe seems to be increasing its influence. And they're trying to co-opt more and more communities. Look at Atheism+.

&gt; Bear in mind that when ""positive discrimination"" you describe happens it's only intended as a temporary measure to address that. Even when we have equal treatment it may act to maintain existing inequalities rather than address them

What we should strive for is equality of opportunity, not equality of result. What matters is that you give me as much chance as everyone else. If I choose to throw away those opportunities, then that does not oblige you to make sure that I get as much as someone who did work hard.

We shouldn't be teaching that bigotry is only wrong because of the consequences against the victim, the point is that it has no basis in reason or fact. It's senseless. Calling a black person a monkey isn't wrong just because it's hurtful, it's wrong because it's scientifically ignorant. It's unaccountable bigotry that's the issue here, not who was hurt by her words.

I think it's important that society has a level of consistency when criticising bigotry. The idea that some groups are basically ""allowed"" to be racist or sexist or whatever because they're a minority is deeply patronising and undermines that group entirely. It's almost like treating them as children, saying they don't know any better or aren't harming anyone.

The bakery would have happily baked a plain cake knowing it was going to be for an event celebrating gay marriage. Their issue wasn't that it was for a gay event. Their issue was that the cake specifically, in the text, blasphemed against their beliefs. 

The image and text was not of the bakers design, it was provided to them. Hell its actually copyrighted material, and that would have been a far better ground to refuse on.

If you provided an image of an Arab male and the word ""mohammed"" underneath it, for printing on a cake at a Muslim business, I guarantee you not only would the law be interpreted to allow the bakery to refuse, but the requesting party would likely find itself on the receiving end of charges of inciting racial hatred. 

That is despite the fact that they have not drawn the image, merely reproduced it. And despite the fact that even if they had drawn it, it would not have been against scripture.

This just isn't correct.  FSG came to LFC intending to spend smart to compete with those of greater financial clout.  The money was there this summer.  FSG's policy doesn't rule out signings like Sanchez at 35m, it rules out signings like Di Maria at 60m.  Under FSG, we won't wildly overpay for players, but we can still buy talent.  

The failure is absolutely on the transfer committee, full stop.  A talented goal-scorer would have been enough to finish in the top 4 this season.  The money was there to purchase a goal-scorer in the summer.  The committee failed to bring in the right player.  

Especially while Anfield is being expanded, the way to compete with the billionaires is through sound investment.  This isn't the apocalypse, it's an obstacle.  If the club stumbles, and a young, impatient, somewhat naive player decides to leave, let him leave for the right price and use that money to bolster the areas of the squad that are lacking.  

It's disappointing that Sterling wants to leave, but we have players to fill in his position.  We just aren't short on wingers / number 10's.  Spend on a striker, compete for trophies this coming season, show that this isn't a crisis.

null,false,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,null,"&gt; But I do agree with it principle, because it prevents people from falling into the trap of doing nothing, and therefore losing the habit and motivation to go outside and do something productive, which is good b/c it'll also help them be comfortable enough to jump straight back into work when the time comes.

Agreed. Work does infact offer something other than money. Something to get up for in the morning can do you the world of good, but not when its forced upon vulnerable people in this way.

Anecdotal, but for me it was not workfare, but infact taking part in a graduate training scheme that helped me get into work. Not only did it make me more attractive to employers, it also gave me a lot more confidence, a better work ethic and generally made me happier. I didn't get paid for it but it made a tangible difference to my life. The key reason why I feel it was successful is that I chose to do it and found the opportunity myself, because it was relevant to my skillset and my career aims.

&gt; Perhaps I would also suggest that such a scheme shouldn't simply stop benefits if the choice is not to do the work, but perhaps lower it.

I disagree here, the scheme should never be compulsory in the sense that any amount of benefits will be removed. This is not an incentive to work, this is a threat to take away their only source of income. Unemployment in itself is massively demoralising and puts significant pressure on you. The last thing you want is somebody threatening to take away your only means of supporting yourself if you don't do something against your will, especially when the suggested community work may be completely mismatched to your current skills or future aspirations. 

I do however believe that nobody should receive job seekers allowance (or the proposed youth allowance which amounts to the same thing) without making a concerted effort to find work. As it stands this is measured by the number of job applications which are made per week. I personally feel this is a poor indicator of effort as some online applications require hours of work (Essay style questions etc.), whereas some opportunities only require a CV and cover letter. In my opinion the advisor should pick an application made by the job seeker and ask targeted questions about it like an interview; find out why they are applying for this particular job, how they have tailored the application and give them pointers and targets on where they could improve. Job seekers should be encouraged to volunteer certainly, but other options should always be made available to them. Perhaps increased one to one sessions with their advisor if they choose to not pursue a volunteer role? Not having to spend an extra couple of hours at the job centre would be an incentive to try harder, not taking benefits away (Actually I think they already do this in some cases, but its only for signing a piece of paper more frequently, not for any additional guidance or assistance).

&gt; On the other hand, it could be an opt-in scheme whereby benefits are raised if you do. Despite all of this, again, I do agree with the principle

This would certainly work. The fairness of the wage could still be called into question, but this would be the most effective way to get people into the scheme willingly. However, I do not believe getting as many unemployed young people as possible onto this scheme is their primary aim (Excluding getting them back into work which is obviously no. 1). 

The lack of funding is a real issue here. Forcing young people onto work schemes will relieve pressure on job centre advisors (who are busier than GPs these days), whilst will also inevitably lead to some signing off completely. Therefore I think one of the aims is an overall reduction in the cost of Job Seekers Allowance. As much as Cameron says the scheme isn't about money, I don't believe him. Its clearly the main factor (or in this case limitation) that is driving Conservative policies.

The religion is based around everyone being treated equally regardless of race, creed or religion. You can see this for yourself if you visit a Gurudwara (something I'd suggest trying out):

- No priests with elevated status. There is no real Sikh 'clergy' so to speak and everyone who is able to sits on the ground to pray and eat.

- Free food for everyone, regardless of whether you are a regular Sikh worshipper or Richard Dawkins. If you ever go to a Gurudwara around lunchtime, you'll probably see groups of Eastern European manual labourers who are only there to eat and are catered to with no qualms.

I could go on but it's best if you see these things with your own eyes. The faith is not perfect but, as with any 'good' religion, it's the way people use it that makes the difference. In my experience, Sikhs in the UK tend to use Sikhism as a force for good and integration rather than alienation and hatred.

&gt; Is this in the original texts or in the interpretation?

The texts are naturally more modern due to being newer, but interpretation is typically also liberal.

Due to the relative prosperity of Punjab (from where most Sikhs originate) Sikhs have gained a reputation as big drinkers and meat eaters in India, both of which go against tenets of Sikhism.

There is a fairly liberal attitude to interpretation of the religious texts. For instance, the average Sikh man you see in Britain will probably be clean-shaven and won't wear a turban. Indeed, the first thing my granddad did when he came to England in the 60s was shave and have his hair cut. 

While Sikhs as a whole are probably more religious than White British on average, you'll probably agree that that's not saying much. As we become more prosperous, the strictness with which we apply Sikhism is also declining and the more general ideas of the faith are being emphasised more. My father (who has been in England since age ~15) rarely goes to the Gurudwara. My mother did strongly encourage me to visit the temple as a child (and I still do so a couple of times a month) but, again, the emphasis was more on family values and being a good person, while more strict things like not drinking or eating meat were not adhered to.

I think you'll find that Hindus/Sikhs/Indians in general are more liberal in our application of religion due to the fact that we're fairly prosperous in the West and have no reason to adhere to hard-line religious principles.",null,0,null,1432070935,null,0,false,0,creicom,null,t3_36fawa,null,t1_creicom,null,t1_crehdp9,null,null,null,1433156409,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Ryde Round table is a fairly small group of men aged 18-45. The main aim of the group is simply to make friends. The meetings are usually an activity and a meal - typical activities could be: pool, bowling, shooting, fishing, ghost walks,  BBQs - anything we can find to do as a group. we are keen to get new members this summer. 

Also we do some charity work - like marshalling events. Theres nothing secret about this group - its not like a masonic group. Membership subs are about £9 per month. Its quite relaxed &amp; you dont have to do any activities or charity work if you dont want to. 

Also we meet up with other round table groups from Europe. This year we visit Bregenz in Austria, where the local group will plan the weekend for us. 

Please get in contact if you're interested - ryderoundtable@gmail.com - or feel free to ask me anything about it.

In total the benefits I would be entitled to actually be equivalent to £198.50, that comes out to £6.61/h which is *more* than the minimum wage.

That said someone working 30 hours a week at £5.80 per hour would be able to get about £65 a week income support and housing benefit so they would be about £45 a week better off than on a workfare scheme.

It also mentions sentencing guidelines:

&gt;The sentence appropriate for perverting the course of justice essentially depends on three matters:

&gt;the seriousness of the substantive offence to which the perverting of the course of justice related;
    
&gt;the degree of persistence; and
    
&gt;the effect of the attempt to pervert the course of justice on the course of justice itself.

From what I understand the student was released without charge and the effect on the course of justice was negligible since there is clear evidence from the start that the allegations were false.

If you're starting again from scratch the cheapest method of doing a solid fence is [close-board fencing](http://www.thewildegroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Closeboard-fencing-21.jpg). Where you concrete in the posts, [attach rails](http://i0.wp.com/www.tidygardens.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fencing-services-4.jpg), nail [gravel boards](http://www.withamtimber.co.uk/library/fencing/wooden-gravel-board-3.jpg) along the bottom, then nail on the feather-edge (vertical) boards in-situ (using a spacer to get the overlaps all the same). 

This as opposed to paneled fencing where you concrete in the posts *exactly* 6ft apart, then fit the pre-made panels in the gaps.

The latter option is quicker but more expensive, not as wind-resistant, and eventually the panels tend to fall apart if they're sat on the ground.

that's a very problematic statement. In some senses people can but it really depends what part of the constitution is being contested. For example the constitutionality of free speech includes campaign donation has been hotly debated, whereas the right of government – which we are discussing here – to target political opponents or dissidents is rare (and has continued under every President since WW2) (it also says something that whether money is free speech is hot contested, the cracking-down of protests however, surely obviously free speech, goes largely ignored). The ability to claim damages is a red herring. It's a bit like the ability of black Americans to successfully sue their racist police forces - which they often successfully do. In the end though it doesn't stop those police forces from being racist. Partially again because of the vast distinction – unknown to liberals it seems – of the difference between *de jure* and *de facto* racism

&gt;Your argument is about as nonsensical as ""what is the point of police, if criminals still commit crimes?""

Only if you willingly misunderstand my argument. The constitution has done **nothing** to stop the federal or state governments from doing what we are discussing here.

Your charge is the familiar one which all critics of religion get.  To paraphrase:

&gt;Why you always pick on our religion?

To some extent, I actually agree with you!  I have written more reddit comments about Islam than other religions and perhaps I should spread the blame around a bit more.  

So, why don't I criticize e.g. orthodox Judaism?  Well, in fact, I've got no problem doing so, and have done so in the past.  

I am sure that there are orthodox Jewish sects in which women are mistreated and who have turned their back on rationality and hence deserving of criticism.  

But, let's get some perspective.  First of all, the number of these people in Europe is *microscopic* compared to the Muslim population.  

Secondly, I just don't see the same degree of problems coming from the more hardline Orthodox Jewish communities, but perhaps that's just because their numbers are so small.  In any case, you let me know when Orthodox Jews start suicide bombing and I'll be sure to write a strongly worded reddit comment against them.

Finally and even though you likely won't believe me, I'll repeat that I honestly don't have a problem with Muslim people and I don't think anyone should be discriminated against on the basis of their religion. If I'm being honest - I do worry about how fast the Muslim population is growing, but that's because of their ideology and not anything to do with the people themselves.

* multi-member constituencies with a Single Transferable Vote. This means you get bigger constituencies, but each constituency appoints multiple MPs. You vote by ordering the candidates in order of preference (like in AV which is basically a single-member version of this)
* A mixed member parliament, where each constituency is represented by a MP, but afterwards additional MPs (which don't represent any particular constituency) are added from the different parties in such a way the total parliament is a Proportional Representation of the voter share for each party. It is also possible that you get a separate vote, to vote for a party - so you don't have to vote for the same party as the MP you choose to represent your constituency. This system is what they use in Germany.
* Very similar is the additional member system. Again people vote for both a constituency MP and a party. Here the number of additional MPs (which don't represent a particular constituency) is fixed. This means in some cases the result isn't entirely PR, because it is possible that a party obtains a number of constituency MPs that is a larger fraction of the total number of MPs than their share of the party vote.

It's a stupid term given that 'Black' isn't even the largest ethnic minority group in the UK, that being 'Asian', as well as the fact that 'minority ethnic', just sounds odd. In English, we usually put the adjective before the noun, e.g. '*red door* not *door red*'. Yes, this isn't always the case, but to a native speaker 'ethnic minority', just sounds a hell of a lot more natural than 'minority ethnic'.

But, I think that's the point, it's supposed to be pretentious and lofty, because that appeals to the people who use it. It's just a stupid term that has caught on with the perpetually offended 'intellectuals' of tumblr and the left-wing media, esp. *The Guardian*, because they are too afraid to use terms such as 'Black', 'Asian' or 'White', because, you know... people know what they mean, and what they mean is bad!

These people think you can make discriminatory sentiments go away by changing the terminology used, e.g. *cripple* becomes *handicapped*, *spastic* becomes *special*. Never realising that it's the concept the words are referring to which colour the term and not the other way around! Thus, these terms eventually have to be replaced by something else, and the cycle never ends.

That's why *coloured person* is now apparently egregiously offensive, but *POC* (Person of Colour; another incredibly stupid term, given that it's just a clever linguistic trick of saying the exact same thing) is ok!

Not many people like being in the way, so i'd expect a large number of cyclists have factored in the disruption.

When planning a route, i'll avoid being on a 40mph road with fast moving traffic as much as sensible, but without expert local knowledge, navigating the ""quiet"" roads can become a mess of one-way systems that requires a satnav and turns every 100 yards.  Sometimes it's impossible to avoid a short stretch on a nasty road.

When there is a cycle path, i'll tend not to trust it if i don't know it: i don't particularly want to be hopping on and off the kerb in fast moving traffic.  Better to keep a straight line.  If there are two lanes, people can usually go around.  Oftentimes i'll try it and give up sooner or later when i start to feel like it's making an acrobat of me.

Another way to look at it is that although a car can go faster, it's much wider and less manoeuvrable than a bike.  Then, taking a circuitous back route to make up for the disadvantages of other people's choice of vehicle has its limits.

Country B also has 2 people. One earns £1000, the other £200. It has no taxes. Thus the effective incomes are still £1000 and £200.

Which is more equal? In country A, both have the same amount of money, while in country B, one has 5x more than the other. A rational person would thus conclude that A is more equal.

This has the traditional multiplier effect (or *de*multiplier effect in the case of deflation), that companies make less money, can't afford to employ as many people, thus people have less money to spend, companies make less money etc. continuing the spiral downwards. But this idea of deflation as a no-go area is contested because people can't put off spending indefinitely when it comes to food etc., and when it comes to non-necessities e.g. ornaments, people won't just wait forever and eventually buy something with the money they've held back.

As for the current situation, there is no need to panic because inflation will almost certainly improve again in one or two months. It is also good in a way because it's a short time when people's purchasing power has increased (b/c prices are lower), without any danger that we'll be in a hopeless situation like Japan.

And I truly believe Europe will simply say ""nope"", for the following reasons:

- Cameron is shit in Europe. Can anyone can name me a single ally he has made which supports the British position on the ills of the EU? Can anyone name me a single initiative or policy implemented by the EU which Cameron was the driver of? Can anyone point out where he has showed any sort of leadership in the Ukraine or Mediterranean migrant crisis?

- Europe (in general) is exasperated by Britain, and is unlikely to make any concessions. One of the major nations in the union constantly bashing the union puts the entire union at risk, they would rather cut off the gangrenous limb than try to cure it. 

Both of these indicate to me that Cameron will not succeed to renegotiate anything.

To explain the difference CPI and RPI, CPI is the same measure used all over the world and so it is comparable, and that is the reason it is the one economists tend to refer to. The RPI, on the other hand, better reflects the actual situation in the UK because it takes things into account which are peculiar to the UK. For example, because the UK public buy houses, the RPI takes house prices into account; but because most other countries rent rather than buy, their inflation rates don't consider house prices.
