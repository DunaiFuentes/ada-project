null,false,boardsandbikes,null,null,null,"1) A combination of the two is best. Two people on the post, everybody in the area is marked, with two people free to track runners/push out to win the second ball. Zonal marking is fine, but you need to have very strong players, who can take a hit, as the likelihood is that the opposition will have the run on you. Man marking is probably more effective as you stop this momentum.

2) 4 at the back without a shadow of a doubt. While playing with three at the back is more solid, it means you are sacrificing one player. If you have a good defensive midfielder they should be dropping almost to the point of playing as a third defender anyway.

3) I always like three in midfield. One holder, one passer and one runner. Alternatively a Juventus style midfield with one deep playmaker and two runners. As for specialists vs. flexibility, it depends on what roles you want them to play. Ideally in the first three I've mentioned, they should be fantastic in those tight knit roles. Alternatively in the Juve-style midfield the runners also need to have good defensive and passing skills, so need to be more flexible.

Best midfield I can think of: Souness, Gerrard and Alonso.

I think the public are being less and less tolerant to people in public services striking to improve their job conditions. Realistically, most people couldn't give a fuck about other people's job conditions, but when they cause a massive disruption then most people will respond negatively.

In an ideal world I think we should pull everyone up to a decent pay level with good conditions, but in reality that's probably not going to happen because there isn't that amount of money going around.

I'd have never done that in the past, but you see how situations go, you see how quick police can be to pull out their gun, and it makes you wary of them. I think a lot of the time, Americans don't look at police as being there to work for them, but more to work for the government, or themselves. 

There was one time when i was around 16 or 17, about 10 years ago, i hadn't been living in the US for more than a few years, but i had was organizing a show with bands out on a bandstand in the middle of a small town in the middle of Georgia. We had permission   by the town to put the show on, but at around 10pm, as the show was getting ready to end, an officer walks up and tells us we need to shut it down. I proceed to explain that this was the last band and after that we're done, which he responds to me ""i don't give a rat's ass whats going on, shut it down now."" Right next to me was my 7 year old brother, and i, feeling belligerent, asked the cop not to say ass in front of my little brother (i didn't really care, i just wanted to play my face up a bit because of the way he was treating me). 

He promptly steps up to me, so that my face is right in front of his, and keeps thrusting his head forward so that the brim of his hat would keep hitting my head, while telling me in cadence with his thrusts ""when i tell you to do something, you do it, you don't question me."" That was in front of a lot of people, including the parents of one of my friends. Their response was ""well, you probably should have stepped back and just done as he said."" And that's the general attitude towards police in this country. Just do what they say, even if it's wrong or harmful, because if you don't, it's your word against theirs, and theirs is backed up by a gun that he will probably never be challenged on when he uses it (at least until camera phones came about, and that's what we're seeing now).

I repeat. It's always ""my fault"" want to know something funny? 

I probably protect more of white culture than most white people. One of my earliest jobs was helping out with the local butcher. I learnt a whole bunch of ""British"" traditional cooking. Hell? One of my first volunteer posts was a regular slot with The Winged Fellowship (AKA Vitalise the guys who run hotels for the disabled). 

I play the violin, something most ""British"" kids were unwilling to do because it was hard work unlike the guitar. When I lived in Prague I held regular tickets to go see the Opera and Ballet. Why? It was cheap and I enjoyed the fact that Prague still treated those art forms as living pieces and improved on them and made them more accessible to everyone. I sucked at football but I was a pretty decent hand at Rugby and Cricket. I know such a stereotype! But c'est la vie. Our school PE teacher liked spin and I was a half decent batsman.

Now here is the difference. If you left those 11 year olds the discrimination would stop. You got discriminated against by kids who are dicks and are kids. I have been discriminated against by adults who have no excuse. 

Ever been asked to produce a passport by a date to prove you aren't after a visa to the UK? Nope? I have. Ever been forced to take your trousers off in an airport? I have. Ever had the police come round to talk about you being a suspect in a bike theft of your own damn bike? I have. 

It's not just school. I mean? What do I care about some racist kids? It's just a story to demonstrate how racism can affect even kids who are acting out the biases of their parents. But these are people who probably didn't think they were being all that racist. They thought they were being prudent. 

I got called a dick for refusing to show my passport to a young lady once to prove I was ""British"". That's not something you will ever have to face. 

Oh and FYI? IF you really want to protect British Tradition? Then I suggest you join a Morris Group. I cannot, where I come from I am one of the people who bakes cakes for Mayday Celebrations (since I bake cakes like a beast). 

Oh I also work in rural India as a doctor representing the UK. Cause I speak Tamil as a first language alongside English. 

See that's the thing. I can go down the pub, spend time with my friends and recite freaking Shakespeare while thinking bout the Spirit of Dunkirk while waiting for a cup of tea to cool down... and I would still not be British Enough and Still Be Discriminated. Someone would blame my Diwali and/or the fact I prefer the formal outfits of my culture rather than the tuxedo as not being integrated enough. 

The point is even if I changed my name to Kevin and dressed exclusively in the tartan of McLeod, I would still be treated as Asian and alien by a sufficient group of people.

* What will the assets within the trust be invested in? There would typically be an underlying investment portfolio
* The tax treatment of funds within trusts is complex and pretty punishing, especially if dispersals aren't made for many years.
* They can't use the increased IHT allowance as the property portion is only relevant where the inheritee is a direct descendant.
* There will most probably be significant ongoing costs.
* The Trust will be at the mercy of the prevailing HMRC regime over the years.

This sort of Gift Trust is pretty basic from an IHT-planning point of view, and depending on your parents' ages may or may not be a good idea from a purely tax-planning perspective. 

The estate needs to be of a pretty high value to consider this course of action. Â£1M+ at least, probably more since the new rules (maybe Â£1.5-Â£2M+ now), when you consider the long-term running costs and tax treatment.

Not only that, but there are issues with anything they place into the Trust and continue to use (property, vehicles, etc.). These would be considered ""gifts with reservation"" and are subject to a punishing tax regime.

&gt;You are only recuperating money from students who come from poor backgrounds and successfully overcame them. 


True, but they did get more money than everyone else so that would make sense. 


&gt;Students from well-off backgrounds pay nothing. 

Rich students pay nothing, their parents will pay no matter what the system. 

Well off students pay back almost as much as the poor students (seeing as the biggest part of the Lin is fees), they get money from their parents. 

Normal students don't get the extra money the poor students get so they pay back as much as the well off students (not far off the poor students) but their parents often don't have much to give their children, these tend to be the students who work through university (also the category I fell into). 


Poor students get extra money, and pay back, at the moment the same as the normal and well off students, *but get more* and in future will pay back slightly more (I.e. What they borrowed). The money they get is designed to put them on par with the well off students and, if managed properly, these students shouldn't need to work through uni. 


So very few students pay back nothing and the poor students aren't the ones being fucked over by the system. 


&gt;It's a slightly cheaper system. That doesn't make it better. The results are poorer. 


I'd say the cheaper part is what makes the results better, it doesn't stop people going to university and 75% of students won't pay back what they owe anyway essentially making it a grant. Those that can it back the whole amount, should. 


&gt;If you actually want a better system you should reintroduce the grants, expand them so most people can qualify for them and then introduce a real graduate tax that taxes all university graduates regardless of whether they took out a loan. 


I agree with you here, free tuition and grants the tax or the more achievable option is give everyone the same loan (I.e. Enough to pay for university independently no matter what they background). 



I understand that you think the system unfairly holds back poorer students who go on to become successful but where do we draw the line? Cheaper mortgages for people who don't have parental help?

That as a doctor, once I was called up to discuss my foreign accent by a man from the same place as me with the same accent resulting in an insane conversation where a patient had demanded a doctor who could speak ""English"" and not with a foreign accent to someone with the same damn accent. 

Mate, I probably do fit in more than even you but here is the thing? I fit in with those who accept that I have different cultural influences. The problem is every single example is people making harmful decisions based on my skin colour and assumptions. 

You can keep trying to fit in and no one will ever truly accept you. And that's the horrible truth. You will end up with a core of friends who matter but there will be random people who will do things based on your race day in and day out that will irritate you.

Interesting tool where you can play Chancellor.

Edit: here are some of the conclusions from the reports.

    Tax Measures:

**Winners:**

â¢ Most income tax payers, a bit

â¢ Wealthy home-owners and their descendents

â¢ High-income people receiving modest dividends

â¢ Most companies (i.e. their customers/employees/shareholders)

**Losers:**

â¢ High-income people saving a lot in a pension or renting out property

â¢ People receiving large dividends

â¢ UK-born / long-term resident non-doms

â¢ People buying insurance or (after 2017) new cars

â¢ Firms using insurance or renewable-source electricity

â¢ Highly profitable, low-leverage banks

â¢ Tax evaders

**Conclusions**

â¢ Huge number of major reforms

â¢ Hard to discern a theme or strategy

â¢ Several of the changes make no economic sense

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Buy-to-let mortgage relief, VED hypothecation, CCL on renewables, IHT
main residence relief, pension annual allowance withdrawal

â¢ Announcing paths for future tax rates raises hopes of future stability

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Rates of corporation tax, annual investment allowance and bank levy as
well as income tax, NICs and VAT

â¢ The more uncertain costings are almost all revenue-raisers


    Distribution Analysis

**Tax credits and the minimum wage**

â¢ OBR estimates Â£4 billion direct impact on gross earnings

â Some lost in income tax, NICs and withdrawn benefits

â¢ Much smaller than the takeaway from tax and benefit changes

â¢ Crucially, tax credits and minimum wages targeted differently...

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Tax credits support those with low annual family incomes

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Minimum wages support those with low hourly wages, many of whom
have higher family incomes

â¢ ... and so are not substitutes

**Conclusions**

â¢ Where did Mr. Osborne find his Â£12 billion?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Further across-the-board freezes in benefit rates (Â£4bn in 2020-21)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Very large further cuts to tax credits (Â£6bn)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â A takeaway from housing associations and LAs (Â£1.4bn)

â¢ Chose to focus tax credit cuts on working families

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Many of whom will not be compensated by higher NMW

â¢ Limiting support to two children significant step in weakening relationship between need and entitlement in the benefit system

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Theme emerging with caps on support for children, housing costs, and
total benefit income

     Taxes up, borrowing up, departmental spending up

**Summary**

â¢ Chancellor to borrow more than forecast in the March Budget in each of the next three years but less in 2019-20
â Despite this debt is forecast to be lower than forecast in March each year from 2015-16 â due to asset sales

â¢ Departmental spending cuts forecast to be more gradual over the parliament than manifesto implied (but slightly larger by 2019-20)

â¢ Spending Review likely to be seeking cut of Â£19bn from departments outside of the NHS, aid, schools and MoD by 2019-20

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Real cut to these areas of 12.6% since 2015-16, 32.8% since 2010-11

â¢ Cap on public sector pay increases of 1% for a further 4 years

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â Could reduce cuts to general government employment over 2014-15 to 2019-20 to 200,000 rather than the 400,000 forecast by OBR

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;â But reduces attractiveness of working in the public sector which might make it harder to recruit and retain quality workers",null,0,null,1436456452,null,0,1436457575,0,csxhvuw,null,t3_3coduq,null,t1_csxhvuw,null,t3_3coduq,null,null,null,1437713036,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

If the Euro goes into a tail spin, and the exchange goes up to 1.6 (which is dramatic, but not outside the realm of possibility) we could hit Krychowiak's buyout clause for around 10 million pounds. 

If we want to pay a premium for domestic experience, James McCarthy seems to me to be the best bet. It'll probably cost around Â£20 million at least, but it'd be worth it to have a proven premier league starter working alongside Bentaleb.

&gt;Driving duties vary. On some lines, the continued use of older trains means that drivers themselves use a lever known as the ""dead man's handle"" to move them between stations.
More modern trains, making up the majority of stock, drive and stop themselves, relying on automatic signalling. On these, it's the driver's job to decide when to close the doors and leave stations. He or she can also override the system in case of an emergency, such as a customer falling on the track. All trains are set to move to the modern system by 2020, TfL says.

So some drivers have to hold a handle whilst the train is moving. The rest are automated. The drivers job is to open and close the train doors, and stop the train.

Any job which only requires six months training is not skilled. Just to show how ridiculous that is, vets have to have five years minimum of training, and start on around Â£24000.

now, i know you stated that he scores most of his goals from penos and fk? so what? i want someone who can bury them in my team. you also mention his illnesses? he did call out sick and just not show up, he showed up to training facility and was seen by doctors. he gave no effort? his effort has picked up if anything. 

anyways, im sorry to say it but you have this ill conceived notion of who balotelli is. balotelli is a guy who if we keep him i won't be upset but if he is sold i won't be upset, because of his performances. but to say that he is not talented, lazy, and doesn't possess match winning ability is reckless, nigh idiotic. 

finally, what makes you think balotelli is such a 'bad guy'? the media? im sorry, but i've heard nothing but good things about the guy from teammates at lfc.

anyways, snewo12, i know most people are upset with balotelli, but his value is fuck all right now. we might be stuck with him. but there are far worse players to be stuck with. balotelli is the kind of guy who can score 15 goals in a season, easily. i kinda hope he sticks around and scores 15-20 and shuts everyone up.",null,0,null,1436457924,null,0,false,0,csxiuz6,null,t3_3coc7i,null,t1_csxiuz6,null,t1_csxexap,null,null,null,1437713778,null,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9,null

Because of the way the debt is paid back they will both be paying the same for several years until the richer person's is paid off and by that time you would expect the poorer person to be earning more so these loan repayments are much less significant.

Every last bit of it, good and bad - Marmite, village fetes, country lanes, people saying 'mustn't grumble' and 'I'm terribly sorry but', people apologizing to me when I conk them with a nameless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, stinging nettles, seaside piers, Ordnance Survey maps, crumpets, hot-water bottles as a necessity, drizzly Sundays - every bit of it.

&gt;What a wondrous place this was - crazy as fuck, of course, but adorable to the tiniest degree. What other country, after all, could possibly have come up with place names like Tooting Bec and Farleigh Wallop, or a game like cricket that goes on for three days and never seems to start? Who else would think it not the least odd to make their judges wear little mops on their heads, compel the Speaker of the House of Commons to sit on something called the Woolsack, or take pride in a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy? ('Please Hardy, full on the lips, with just a bit of tongue.') What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardners' Question Time and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.

&gt;How easily we lose sight of all this. What an enigma Britain will seem to historians when they look back on the second half of the twentieth century. Here is a country that fought and won a noble war, dismantled a mighty empire in a generally benign and enlightened way, created a far-seeing welfare state - in short, did nearly everything right - and then spent the rest of the century looking on itself as a chronic failure. The fact is that this is still the best place in the world for most things - to post a letter, go for a walk, watch television, buy a book, venture out for a drink, go to a museum, use the bank, get lost, seek help, or stand on a hillside and take in a view.

&gt;All of this came to me in the space of a lingering moment. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I like it here. I like it more than I can tell you.â

Firstly the law tends to review contract terms objectively - that is to say that if it said Â£400 you could possibly argue it, but no reasonable person is ever going to believe that the landlord consciously drafted the contract intending to rent a property for Â£2/month. This is the same way that companies like Amazon who have in the past accidentally sold flatscreen TV's for 50p have managed to have the contracts voided - they aren't objectively reasonable.

Secondly you were actively paying Â£500 per month for 12 months, which means at some point you must have (verbally or otherwise) agreed to that figure. You would be hard pressed to argue that you had entered the contract assuming it really was Â£2 - accidentally overpaid for 12 months, and have only just now realised you are several thousand pounds out of pocket.

If you want to make a living from programming, you can't really go wrong right now learning asp.net MVC and Entity Framework. There are some excellent tutorials on the [asp.net website](http://www.asp.net/mvc) right now. Design yourself a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) application using MVC and put it on github. It doesn't have to be fancy or have an amazing idea behind it. People want to see that you are capable of creating something which works, from scratch, which can be used and doesn't fall over. [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâviewâcontroller) is great because it forces people (tries to) to separate their application into logical layers. You will learn much on your way with this framework, [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) and the [unit of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction) pattern, most likely without realising it.

If you're happy using CBT based training, you won't go far wrong with the [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) training videos. Again, if you look hard enough on the internet, you can find them.

Learn a bit about [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Unit testing is great and you should understand it. Some people are evangelical about TDD, but understanding what it's about it as good as anything. It just builds on top of unit testing.

Above all else, don't worry about learning everything straight away. I've been writing software since 2003 and there's always something new to learn (which is probably why I enjoy it so much). Don't get too caught up in the next big things, such as Angular.js and all that unless you're specifically interested. There's a lot of fluff about that will phase out as quick as it has come in and a lot of people who say you should be doing it.

If you enjoy doing something, you will learn it quickly.

    * There are already 1,700 pallets on the bonfire which has a core of tyres down the middle, and hundreds more pallets remain to be added, which will make it even bigger.

Even in the above table one, ignoring those from Kosovo &amp; Albania &amp; assuming all migrants in the 'other' column &amp; 'unspecified sub-Saharan nationals' are non refugees (unlikely) we're still at 53%. 

Of course it's impossible to say *for sure*. But I think it's fairly damaging when ministers say blanket statements like this. Due to the rhetoric around this issue people here believe they're all fakers or economic migrants when it's quite clear that's not the case if you look at the figures. The largest swath of people, not the majority but the largest groups are from countries where it is almost assumed you will be granted asylum. In that way I agree with the final point in the article:

""But Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren reacted angrily to his comments.

'The immigration minister's sweeping judgment that the majority of people arriving on Europe's shores from some of the world's biggest refugee producing countries are economic migrants is utterly startling,' she said.

'The Government must stop looking for flimsy excuses to justify dealing with this humanitarian crisis at arm's length.'""

It's evidently clear that is why he's making these statements. We send ships to help the migrants, but where do we drop them? In Italy. Who do we expect to deal with those claims? Italy. Who do we expect to house those immigrants? Italy. We aren't doing anything to help alleviate the problem at all, be it accepting the immigrants ourselves or finding somewhere else outside Europe that will accept them (or helping Italy with the cost of housing &amp; dealing with claims!). All we're doing is going on about ""stopping the people traffickers!"", as if that solves the problem. No all that does it mean these people remain in their countries to be persecuted, it doesn't reduce the number of refugees. But I suppose if a few people die of torture in Eritrea who cares if they're not British eh?

Coutinho gets a lot of 'second assists' (i.e. the ball before the assist) and score the occasional worldy from outside the box. He's hovering around the same price he was last year. He's in the medium-price midfield bracket.

Sterling was a good pick at the start of last year as he got a few goals and some assists - add to the fact he was put up front but getting all the midfielder points he was a decent choice.

Over the year they both got roughly the same points (mid 100s somewhere), which is factored into their FPL price. 

If Sterling goes to City I reckon thats a pretty good price for him albeit he might not be a nailed on starter.

About 70,000 people were executed during the reign of Henry VIII, he ruled for 13,796 days, so that's an average of about 5 a day. That's less than the 30 people killed per day in the US right?.... not quite, because the entire population of The Kingdom of England in 1524 was only about 2.3 million people. So that means about 1 in every 40 people were executed during the reign of Henry VII (okay in reality its slightly higher, as due to higher mortality probably about 3-4 times that number of people ""lived"" during the period of his reign). Never the less... a lot of people were killed by modern standards. 

The best part? Although Henry VII is well known now for his brutality towards his wives - he was actually considered by his contemporaries to be a fairly peaceful king, and infact the number of people killed during his reign was comparatively low.

The point is that people seem to be accepting of guns in the US, and the death count though obviously worrying, doesn't seem to detract them from their desire to have guns. The problem comes when people stroll onto the internet and start mouthing off about guns in the US as if it were as simple as ""well just ban them"", and although it may seem that simple - it isn't. People in the US have a genuine desire to have them, and however bizarre that might seem it's party of what makes them American, in the same way that other countries have quirks that might be questionable to outsiders.

1) Bliss rang up and inquired about booking the event and failed to mention the sex festival aspect. The master of the house sought the services of an ex RIC officer who had become a cynical private detective after a wound he got at the Somme stopped him serving in the police again. He was to investigate Bliss Ireland for possible cult overtones. The detective returned; but was mortally wounded and died by candle light as an owl hooted and the moon shone like blood. He was buried in the crypt but his body mysteriously disappeared one month later. 

2) The person who took the booking failed to hear anything about the sex festival aspect. A busty maid overheard the front of house staff mention Bliss Ireland and, aghast and buxom, she ran, her buttocks jumping lightly with every step, and informed the master of the house of what Bliss Ireland was up to. She only knew about it because her wench sister who has been ostracised from the family joined that cult of satanists two years ago and has a different man betwixt her thighs each night and some morns. 

3) The person who took the booking knew fine well it was sex festival, thought that was fine and good, but is a subordinate to a person or persons who really don't want a sex festival on their estate, but who weren't consulted about this specific event because you don't take fucking bookings, and have minute by minute updates on events when you're king of the castle.

Basically, BBC1's remit is to have as broad an appeal as possible. If BBC Radio 1 plays pop music, BBC 1 the channel plays pop TV.

Programmes on BBC1 are generally more family-friendly. It offers lots of different types of programmes.

BBC2 is traditionally where things go if they don't quite fit into that format. Perhaps they're more niche documentaries, or bluer comedies. It's for more mature audiences in general (not in the sense that it shows age-restricted content, just mainly appeals to adults). If something merits being broadcast but won't get good ratings, it usually goes to BBC2.

BBC 3 is for younger audiences. Especially teenagers and people in their 20s, with Family Guy and Russell Howard being things that come to mind. It's always strongly supported arts and comedy in the UK. But it's expensive to run, so it's getting axed.

BBC Four (TV and Radio) aims at the upper-middle classes and its peripheries. A lot of higher-brow programming which would never make a profit. Period dramas, politics, science, etc.

As I said, the distinction is blurry; programmes can and do move around. A recent example is a high-brow quiz show called Only Connect. It's pretty challenging and wasn't considered pop enough to make it into BBC 1 or 2. But, since ratings were unusually high, it's since been moved to BBC 2.

It was an awful mistake that led to possibly negligent manslaughter, but wasn't murder in my opinion. Those policemen at the time thought they were saving lives and in my opinion only shot him because they thought he was about to detonate a device. 

The point is that the met are truly excellent in both complex crime solving, every day policing and their restraint. So much better than almost anything in the developing or developed world, that some of the criticisms are ludicrous.

One thing that can be said for the unfair attacks or criticism of the police is that it continues to keep them on their toes, the population not realising how good the police are is possibly a good thing - as they won't ever get complacent.

So i'll go through kind of line by line and give my take on it, as im no expert, but from how i understand these. 

1. So Raheem's card here, or his angle, that they're playing (im on the boat that aidy has created this plan and raheem is executing semi poorly)...but they are trying to create a rift between player/reps and club. They are trying to create this image that lfc, rodgers and the entire fan base are abusing raheem and making him feel unwanted. This mobile phone link? It's not beyond the realm of possibilility that aidy set that up knowing that raheem was going to get abuse. The rodgers comments, the i won't sign for 900k per week, all of this bullshit, it's all contradictory and trying to paint the club in a bad light with a broad stroke. 

2. the club will not accept anything less than the 50m we're asking for, that is true. the reason being, we hold all of the cards. Here's why: raheem wants to play in euro 2016, if we bench him for a year (while he gets paid 35k p/w) he will a. not play in euros most likely and b. not even get the 100k p/w that he was asking for. FSG have shown some brass balls and know that raheem is going to suffer more than us. EVEN if we held raheem through the end of his 2 year contract, we would still collect somewhere between 15-20m in tribunal fees. ings is going to go for 10m or so, which means the precendent is going to be raised for raheem who is a far superior talent and was developed at lfc from the time he was 16. 

3. Sterling is misplaying this completely. If I'm raheem, and aidy for that matter, here's what i'd do. I'd sign the 100k p/w contract and take the guaranteed money with a clause in my contract. if lfc do not qualify for champions league by the end of the season, raheem can leave for 40m, if we do qualify, he can leave for 60m. raheem would have been guaranteed 40+ matches this season and now he may or may not get that. 

anyways raheem's camp has made a muck of this. since feb when the contract was offered, raheem could have made 1.5m more in the past 6 months and lfc would have probably still sold him, or could have.

My advice would be to have a look at what languages the jobs you are applying for are using and study them. Learning swift is great because it shows you are aware of current languages and have a desire to stay up to date. Unfortunately there aren't going to be too many employers looking for enthusiastic junior swift programmers at the movement.

BBC channels aren't ranked, the numbers are simply labels. BBC1 broadcasts news, politics shows, serious dramas and documentaries; 2 is more lighthearted, with sitcoms, comedies, light-hearted drama; 3 is mostly comedy aimed at young adults, but also documentaries and politics shows for a younger demographic, it only airs after 7pm, and is switching to online only soon; 4 is cultural documentaries and films. There is also a 24 hour news channel, and a channel which just shows what's happening in Parliament.

The ITV network has 4 channels, although you could easily argue that they are ranked, since 1 shows the news and general entertainment, 2 shows mostly repeats or less popular shows, 3 and 4 mostly either show really old stuff, or reality TV.

The Channel 4 network has their main channel, which shows news, dramas and comedy - it's also been the home of Paralympics for years, they're quite progressive compared to other networks in terms of content. They also have Film4, which shows a lot of great films (and funds a fair few), E4 which shows a lot of American sitcoms, More4 which shows the lesser/older shows, and 4Seven which just repeats prime time TV all day.

What you describe would be fine if unemployment didn't mean losing your house or taking your children out of school or being destitute. If we were all born with the same opportunities, all had the same education, we could all move between jobs without risking our dignity and safety then sure, optimising jobs by salary would work fine. But that's not the world we live in.

In the absence of a decent statutory living wage it is up to workers to collectively bargain for the best deals they can get. And to protect the jobs and the working conditions they have. We expect everybody in society who can work to work, but jobs aren't always available. People have commitments in their lives, like houses and families and bills to pay. We aren't all free agents with safety nets of money to cushion us if we become unemployed. Rights must be fought for and defended.

And a worker has values beyond just their skill and their running cost. What about placing a value on loyalty? Or how someone adds to a workplace's morale?

The reaction the United match was poor to say the least. They gave up, simple as.

Cost of Tax Evasion to Taxpayer

The Home Office Annual Fraud Indicator, suggests in 2011, tax evasion cost the taxpayer Â£15bn (Annual Fraud Indicator) This compares to benefit fraud of around Â£3.8bn. Of this Â£15bn,  
  
An estimated Â£7 billion a year due to âEvasionâ where individual or corporate taxpayers have deliberately omitted, concealed, or misrepresented information in order to reduce tax liabilities;  
An estimated Â£5billion a year due to âcriminal attacksâ on the tax system involving coordinated and systematic attacks by organised criminal gangs.  
An estimated at Â£3billion a year due to âHidden Economyâ fraud consisting of undeclared economic activity from sources deliberately concealed from HMRC. (Criminal tax evasion)
  
Cost of Tax Avoidance  
  
'The cost of tax avoidance is much harder to quantify because there are so many different ways that people can legally reduce their tax bill. However, the figure would be much higher.

 [**Muphry's law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s%20law): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Muphry's law__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""If you write anything criticizing [editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing) or [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading), there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.""  The name is a deliberate misspelling of [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law).

&gt;Similar laws have also been coined, usually in the context of online communication, under names including __Umhoefer's Rule__ (or __UmhÃ¶fer's Rule__),  :357 __Skitt's Law__,  __Hartman's Law of Prescriptivist Retaliation__ (or The Law of Prescriptive Retaliation),  __The Iron Law of Nitpicking__,   __[McKean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean)'s Law__.  and __Bell's First Law of USENET__.  Further variations state that flaws in a printed or published work will only be discovered after it is printed and not during proofreading,  :22,61  and flaws such as spelling errors in a sent email will be discovered by the sender only during rereading from the ""Sent"" box.

Which isn't what I said, I said you're showing bias in the way you're presenting the careers of a right and left wing politician despite the fact they have almost identical career paths. If you'd like to point out where I attacked you personally instead of attacking your argument that would be great. I have absoloutely in no way made an ad hom attack at any point, all of my replies have been centred around the flawed logic in your arguments. 


&gt;You suggested my preference for Miliband was out of sheer blinded love of him or the Labour party. 

Again, where do I suggest that? I suggest your bias againt Osborne is because you hate the Tories, not that you love Labour. Your stance on Milliband could be neutral, all that matters is that your stance on the two is not equal and is not based on objectivity, which is absoloutely obvious from the way you defend one and roast the other despite the fact they have nigh on identical political careers.

Have you mixed up the negative here? You're implying the politically blind would have the best chance of seeing he's the better candidate based on experience (which is hilarious).

Here's a newsflash: wages very often do not reflect either the skill of the job or the amount of hard work an individual does. 

Many people do incredible amounts of work and get paid under the minimum wage, others do next to nothing on executive salaries. Collective bargaining is one of the means by which people are able to increase their wages, just as big business works every day to suppress wages.

Without trade unions you get paid peanuts for massive amounts of work and no job security, see the way in which people are treated by Sports Direct.

*I know it might not make sense, but I try to support as many of the American fellows playing over there [in the Premier League] as possible,â he says to clarify any misunderstanding. ""I started supporting Tottenham because of Clint Dempsey ... but now that he's gone I'm open again, and now you have Jozy Altidore on Sunderland, Brek Shea and Geoff Cameron on Stoke. ... I don't know if that's fair or not."" Upon further consideration, Luck circles back to the question to define his affiliation. ""The team that I follow completely is the Houston Dynamo,"" he says. ""That's my No. 1 team in my heart because my father used to work for that club [as founding president and general manager],"" he said. ""I'm definitely plugged into the MLS season fairly heavily. ... It's fun to see the league grow. I think it's great for the sport in this country.*

There are recipes online for home made clay keepsakes, so ignoring the glitter, [here's a link](http://mamapapabubba.com/2013/11/12/baking-soda-clay-handprint-keepsakes/) to one I found.

As for having a painting done you might find it quite expensive, so that really will depend on your budget. You could always get in touch with the [art college](http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/) and see if there's anything they can do?  
I'm thinking something along the lines of life drawing sessions, but obviously this might not be up to the quality that you are seeking here.  

I'll list a few professional places for Edinburgh:

&gt;Minimum wages do little harm when low, but create unemployment as they riseâindeed, Mr Osborne admitted that the higher wage floor would cost 60,000 jobs. Tax credits, by contrast, are an incentive to hiring. Some complain that they subsidise employers, but around three-quarters of the benefit goes to employees. Despite its fanfare, the new âliving wageâ is fairly modest. But swapping tax credits for minimum wages as a policy for alleviating poverty could do enormous damage in a world where firms are increasingly buying technology rather than paying workers. Ask France, with a generous minimum wageâand joblessness of more than 10%.

As someone who goes to the Lane regularly it's undisputable that the atmosphere at the ground is worse than it was 10-15 years ago, before we were bought by the ENIC group. There's a strong argument that the decline in atmosphere is due to the increase in ticket prices, which has forced a lot of long-time Spurs fans out of the ground. This is indicative of a wider problem with the ENIC ownership, which is that they have always been focused on ensuring Spurs are profitable, often at the expense of the fans.

On net, the various tradeoffs created by minimum wage increases more closely resemble income redistribution among low-income families than income redistribution from high to low-income families.

**University is free for everyone at point of access**

All this crap about how it deterrs students from poor backgrounds because its expensive just doesn't apply when you think about the fact that (a) they don't have to pay it at age 18 and (b) if they haven't finished paying it 35 years later it is written off (and thats 75% of people), that 25% of people that can pay it off are in the position to do so, no matter what their parents earn.


My whole point, which you seem to be missing completely (or are purposefully ignoring out of some misguided classism) is this:

**Your ability to pay for university does not depend on your background but on your future**. 

&gt;But if I had failed, or had to leave Uni because of money (which very nearly happened) 

If you were in receipt of the full grant (which I presume you were since you're blabbering on about silver spoosn etc) and you nearly ran out of money then I'm afraid you didn't manage your money very well. Most people survive on much less than the full loan+grant. 

For example:

Poor student - Â£650 per month from loan + grant = Â£650/month

Normal student - Â£400 per month from loan + Â£250 per month from parents = Â£650/month


See how a poor students background doesn't affect their finance at university?

&gt;because the Government wasn't willing to help house and feed you for a little bit.

Bullshit, if someone gets Â£8k a year now in student loan + grant then they get Â£8k a year under the new system as well so *people are not being priced out of uni* because again, it is free at point of access.

As my first car it's perfect, I paid Â£800 for it and it's mechanically in perfect condition, full service history and it just passed it's MOT with no advisories. My Dad says that it drives very solidly for an almost 25 year old car.

The only bad things I would say are lack of comforts, electric windows or A/C, but that doesn't bother me that much. The main 'issue' is that there is a lot of lacquer peel on it, and annoyingly there's a bit on pretty much every panel. The local sprayer quoted me Â£1200 for a full respray, and while I would love to get it done, it is a lot of money to 'fix' something that doesn't affect the drive.

Anyone in here looking for a first car, I'd definitely recommend one, I'm 23, been driving since the start of the year and my insurance was Â£1064 (third party fire and theft). I'm a guy and was expecting Â£1500+ so I was thrilled at that. Just make sure you take the time to find a good condition one.

Fischer has been injured, that is true, but it was misdiagnosed and he was therefore out for much longer than he should've been. He's only recently started playing regularly again but in a different role, more recently he's been playing as an out and out number 9 (not a false 9 either; it's a different role), usually with two inverted wingers. Since he's played there I don't think he's excelled as much, but the talent is absolutely still there on the ball. There's still no doubt for me he will develop into a very good player (world class is probably a step beyond what he will realistically become).

If I was Paul Mitchell I'd definitely be keeping an eye on him but for the moment Ajax wouldn't let him go and it wouldn't be wise for Fischer's career to go - especially now seeing as we've got Pritchard to integrate into the first team squad now.

What do I like? It's bizarrely fun to drive. It's slow, but doesn't 'feel' as slow as you'd expect for a 1.1. It's not got power steering and as most of my driving is done on rural roads, it's as close to a road going gokart in steering feel as you can realistically get. The girlfriends father owns one of them fancy Audi's pushing 450bhp and a proper 'British sports car', the peugeot even puts a smile on his face! It's horn is on the end of the indicator stork which is nothing but a constant delight as well. Gets fair mileage even with with how I drive, can't complain about that. It's a terrible piss poor colour with black bumpers, yet somehow that seems to please people as well. 

What don't I like? It's small though to be fair it always shocks people as to how much crap you can pile into it with the seats down. The biggest issue with it's size is the fact the steering wheel isn't adjustable and the pedals are stupidly close together, I only just fit in it, even then I can't comfortably rest my right leg when in 5th gear... The electrics occasionally just don't give a fuck and do whatever they feel like, though to be fair as I understand it this Peugeot is actually doing pretty well on that front. It's noisy on the motorway but it's perfectly happy to sit there at 70-80mph with no problem. The throttle response is superb, though sometimes it does stutter when you apply power to quickly. It struggles up some hills, though to be fair my drive to work does involve a 25% incline so on normal hills it's fine. 

But to be honest with you - I love it. I'd love a faster car and I know the 106 is fairly crap, but for 'car people' any car is a joy and I genuinely believe that.  Where I grew up the buses are crap and having that freedom of being able to ship my mum and dad to the shops (neither of them can drive.) without having to stand about for hours for buses is great.

I'm not really up to date on their latest targets but I'm not too sure they'll be in for anyone else, and they haven't really spent that much.

As well as that, there's more pressure on clubs like that to spend big in order to survive. We've got a good standard of player in each position so we don't need to be throwing money like that round. Could we improve? Of course, and if you believe the papers we're looking to improve as well (Â£15 million targets like Wijnaldum, etc), but at the end of the day we are where we are because we're shrewd with signings. Baines, Distin and Jags cost Â£5 million each. Coleman cost buttons. Gerri (hopefully) is the latest example of that.

Our debt isn't too bad because we've avoided dropping silly money on assets, and hanging above it all is the lack of investment, plain and simple. The Lukaku transfer was a bit of an anomaly in that respect. I honestly never thought we'd sign him permanently and was surprised when the figures surface, but at the end of the day, for the foreseeable future that was a one off.

This is just not true.

Now, how exactly are people going to be liberated from work, or work decreased hours, without collective organisation exactly? Historically people have had to fight tooth and nail for any social let alone economic gains won from the rich. Often they have done this as part of trade unions. Universal suffrage and civil rights were won after centuries of struggle and thousands of deaths, and neither even made direct economic demands.

Are you seriously suggesting that automation is suddenly going to arrest that?

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"The 51% number is taking the [first instance decisions](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics) (t.4) plus final decisions (t.5) divided by the total applicants (t.4). The 53% figure was multiplying the migrants crossing by their nationality acceptance rates divided by the total minus Kosovo &amp; Albania, assuming all migrants in the 'other' column &amp; 'unspecified sub-Saharan nationals' have zero acceptance rates. 

Sure &amp; I am questioning the accuracy of the statement because the figures to me don't suggest he's correct. But as you correctly pointed out we cannot be sure. There are no figures for how many of these migrants eventually claim asylum. I would argue the ones that don't claim asylum aren't important to mention, of course they should be deported, no one is disagreeing with that. But by lumping them all under one umbrella it suggests they're all economic migrants which is not correct &amp; paints the wrong picture.

Yes I think overall the percentage is irrelevant. If I was to make a statement on this issue it would be to say we should accept all genuine refugees &amp; not stigmatise it by making unqualified statements about majorities. It's a way to justify their lack of effective help in this matter by suggesting all the migrants are economic migrants. 

Sweden gets more refugees for three reasons:

1. They're in Schengen.
2. They have a more lenient process for accepting people, evident by their much higher acceptance rates. This could mean refugees have a longer time to present their case, better access to legal advice or just that the remit (ie reasons) to accept people is more broad. EDIT: Note I'm not saying their process is more lenient but that is the perception from interviews I've seen.
3. Refugees are more accepted among the population.

I think the first two reasons are probably the most strong. Especially being within Schengen, for instance the Calais situation wouldn't happen if we were part of Schengen. 

I am not even saying we should accept more refugees, all I'm saying is we need to do something to correct the problem or alleviate the situation for the countries accepting more than us. We have a massive foreign aid budget (Â£12 billion), there's no reason we can't use it to solve this problem for instance. The current government has no plans to address this situation. Sending ships to the med does not alleviate the problem for Italy. Stopping people traffickers in Libya does not help the refugees there. If we had stayed in Libya after we bombed Gaddafi we wouldn't even have this issue as the refugees could stay in Libya!

Australia for instance has a system whereby they keep asylum claimants offshore. Why aren't we looking into something like this? I don't support the way Australia is doing this (the conditions are bad) but I support the idea in principle. If I recall correctly the EU made an agreement with Turkey to send back migrants crossing between there &amp; Greece, why can't we make a similar agreement with a Northern African stable country (I guess they are in limited supply...)? The issue I have is currently we have no effective plan to help these people. In the short term we should be accepting more than we are (by saying to Italy/Germany/Sweden OK you can deport X number of migrants here &amp; we'll deal with the claims), in the long term we should find a more equitable solution that our population agrees with.

* Get there early to avoid the hecticness, but sometimes bargains/ extra freebies and samples can be had at the end of the last day
* Mark out all the places you want to go to on the floor plan before you get to the venue
* Go to the stalls you want products form the most, first so they won't run out by the time you get there
* Have a list of exactly what you want, by which brand, and an alt list if you can't get your first choice
* Bring a book, or a magazine, or an extra battery for your phone- queuing can take a while 
* Ask for samples
* If they run out of what you're after, ask if you can make a phone order at the price it is at the show as you're a loyal customer and were really looking forward to this after hearing so much about it etc etc
* Bring a bottle of water, even a sarnie if you don't want to be paying hiked prices for a sarnie
* Leave your coat at home (or bring a big bag to store your layers in) - these places can get seriously hot
* Bring a big bag for all your purchases, sometimes the paper/ string bags break
* Enter competitions- my sibs and I between us always end up with a few things just for filling out some forms
* Have a budget for unplanned purchases

Have fun! I hope you'll make a haul post when you get back :D

edit: Something my sibs and I do is say sib 1 wants a bunch of stuff from one stall and so do I, so I queue and buy both ours whilst they go and do the same for me or my other sib. You can leave each other at various long queues and save time, maybe even get a deal/ freebie for buying more in one go.

Last summer I used to cast quite a lot, hopefully I'll be able to help out!

Currently there aren't any major production teams in the UK. ODPixel used to have PixelPipeline with Wakey, but Wakey has since taken a step away from casting.

As far as UK events go, there's insomnia every 6 (?) months, they Eurogamer Expo and several odd bits and bobs such as IreLAN hosted by Shaneomad, coming up soon.

As far as starting casting, I'd recommend looking at the Amateur Dota 2 League. It's very amateur, but it's a good stepping stone to live casting. Once you start to be good at what you do, people will offer you more and more tournaments to cast and such.

There's some UK casters that are currently super under appreciated which you could talk to such as joeshow, he helped me out a lot so if you show promise I'm sure he'd be willing to do the same.

I used to do some casting, so if you'd like any advice or pointers feel free to ask! Best of luck!",null,0,null,1436471427,null,0,false,0,csxrwag,null,t3_3cootl,null,t1_csxrwag,null,t3_3cootl,null,null,null,1437719476,null,2,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,2,null

They gave Suarez a promise that he would be allowed to transfer for a &gt;40m offer if Liverpool didn't qualify for Champions league the season after he signed his contract in 2012.

Liverpool still did not sell him instead keeping him through the 13/14 season until summer 2014. Liverpool clearly don't care about their player's wishes when it comes to transfers nor do they care about player discontent in any seasons after ignoring their wishes.

&gt; if she was leader of the opposition she would be at the dispatch box giving the Labour party opposition speech to the budget, straight after hearing it, without even having read the damn thing!

Definitely true as well, but also worth remember that she isn't in that position. But I do take your point. People have certain expectations that aren't always easy to meet. And although the questions were about the budget, they weren't strictly about what she would do in full instead. It could be seen, as your argument implies, as a bit of missed opportunity though.

No, the MTR systems there are private companies which happen to be privately owned. Therefore they are run as going concerns and all the profits are put back into upgrades.

Plus people PAY for the upgrades. For instance the fares for the HK MTR were increased by 0.2cents for every single journey for 18 months to pay for platform screen doors. These reduced energy requirements and after the refit fares went back to normal.

For the officers that were killed, we see the following causes; 49 from gunfire, 10 by vehicular assault, 5 were struck by a vehicle and 2 as a result of being assaulted.

Of the remaining deaths we see 7 death from 9/11 related injuries with a further 3 from duty-related illnesses, 5 from pursuit and 1 death from fire.

As a counterpoint, the Guardian has recorded 588 civilians who have been killed by the US police so far in 2015. Of these 512 were gunfire, 32 were taser, 20 were struck by police cars, 21 died in custody and 3 are marked as unknown. 

To put this into perspective (and projecting to the end of the year) 20 US citizens will be shot and killed by the police for every police officer shot and killed by a civillian.

It does now appear to be more dangerous to be a police officer than a soldier in the US - there were 58 causalities in Afghanistan/Iraw in 2014, compared to 124 in 2013 and only 7 in 2015.

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"&gt;  TV is what makes money in contemporary football.

True, but it comes down to how TV money makes it to the club, and whether we would get any marginal advantage from having a good relationship with the broadcasting network.  Having a good relationship with British broadcasters is important because 25% of domestic TV revenue is allocated in proportion to the number of appearances.  Good relationships with overseas broadcasters are irrelevant for league revenue because all overseas TV revenue is distributed equally amongst all teams.

As for the UEFA Cup, the only aspect of revenue distribution that is not fixed or based on performance is the ""market pool,"" but as I understand it, that's allocated in proportion to the domestic TV deals with UEFA and is unaffected by any preference for us that an overseas network might have.  Plus, as a whole, sub-Saharan TV revenue for the UEFA Cup would be small, our relative share of it would be a pittance, and it wouldn't be affected in any way by our having a good relationship with SuperSport.  SS would buy the rights solely on the basis of whether or not they deemed it profitable.

Also, I'd discount the future pretty heavily, as it's always possible that in 3 years someone else will hold the rights.

All of which is why I'd say the real value of a good relationship with SuperSport (and by extension, the Khumalo deal) comes down to how much relative exposure and fan base growth we've gotten in the past four years, the value of which can be long-lasting but difficult to quantify.

He didn't want to quash the rumour. Bring this clip up to him directly and he'll say he never denied that he wanted to cut child welfare. He'll also say that the 30 hours childcare more than offsets the amount he's cut from child welfare. He'll also redirect you by banging on about how it's not fair that the state should pay for more than two children and that he's made it easier for the parents to get out and work sooner than Labour let them. Everything sounds fair, reasonable, good for you, even. And then you strip away the repetitive, brainwashing bullshit doublespeak and you're left with the state dictating the size of your family and endangering family values by making it so much harder for parents to raise their children as long as they want.

Initially the Tram line was meant to go from Edinburgh Airport all the way to the foot of Leith Walk.

Then they announced that the Tram line was going to stop where it does, just barely within spitting distance of the top of Leith Walk.  
This was devastating to those business owners, and for many it left them with no choice but to close up shop. Much of Leith Walk is still empty anyone is yet to open something new.

Ask someone down in Morningside, and they'll just bitch and moan about the ""waste of money"" on a service that was never meant to suit them in the first place.

Ask someone else, and they might remind you that Edinburgh used to have an extensive tram network, all around the city. They got rid of that, and in an effort to modernise the city ripped out all the old lines.

we have good depth most positions. i would say we are in need of another first choice striker. sturridge is 1a. this guy (benteke, rondon, lacazette, whoever we get) would be 1b. that is number one. we have mignolet who improved dramatically over the course of the season and i think will continue his form. we have 4 cbs who i consider class on their day already. sahko being our best, with skrtel/lovren able to duke it out and ilori who i think is an absolute stud. lb moreno is now 23 and i think ready to fully adapt to premier league football and rb we have clyne. we might need another back up for those positions, but we do have wisdom and enrique (who on his day is very good especially if he's a back up) and of course flanno who i think has been a huge miss for us. 

in midfield we have hendo, milner, allen, can, lucas, with rossiter, brannagan and possibly chiravella peppered in there, we have a strong midfield core. we then add further up the pitch lallana, markovich, ibe, firmino and coutinho and we have plenty of options up front. 

i would say if we need any upgrades to our starting XI, that i think are an absolute must before season starts, we need to sign a striker. i know the illaramendi rumors keep persisting and people are pushing the dm issue, but im not totally convinced lucas can and allen can't perform there. illarra would certainly mean the end of lucas though. if anything else, i wouldn't see us signing anyone unless the deal was too good to pass up (lets say for instance toni kroos or modric became available or jordi alba). 

anyways, not gonna lie, from a personal standpoint, i think we're in a good spot as a squad. we have a stronger starting XI from last year with the additions of milner, firmino and clyne (3 starting quality players in any top 4 squad) and if we get another striker that can start in sturridge's absence and make his injury easier, than that'd be beautiful. other than that, we have a lot of young depth and options. almost every position bar full back has 2-3 players who i think could start for liverpool competing for spots. only going to be good for the squad.",null,0,null,1436473656,null,0,false,0,csxtepp,null,t3_3cp059,null,t1_csxtepp,null,t3_3cp059,null,null,null,1437720619,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

*Good*. I've a feeling some in this thread would feel thoroughly entitled to brake check.

They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.

And the load of their loveless pity is worse than the ancient wrongs,

Their doors are shut in the evening; and they know no songs.

The driver in front could move in between the two cars and let the tailgater pass, but then there would be three cars in a line in an unsafe situation. I realise that may be taking liberties in so far as we don't know exactly what's in front of the bus here, but I think others in the thread have commented about when and how buses can and can't reverse (I don't know if that's true).

At the bottom of the article the bus driver commented about what happened (whether or not it's true is another matter) - that she came back and tooted without him seeing her - but given how often I see cars parked in bus stops, I don't think it's outside the realms of chance that he has to do this kind of thing often. He might regularly have to negotiate cars and pull-in to stops like this. On this occasion the driver came back and, rather than move his bus forwards and back (which might not even be practical on that road - who knows?) he opted to make her wait a short time.

I have a feeling it was blown out or proportion by the driver and/or camera-guy in the first place. We're looking at this with hindsight after all - the driver didn't know how those folk would 'kick off' by him saying ""Wait for a bit"". This ties in with my comment about catering to the fuckwits: If I were in that situation as the car driver I'd be mortified that I got in the bus's way and (I hope) would sit quietly and wait. These folk took a different route and (without implying anything about you) your solution is to opt for a quite life where there's no antagonism... but again that's looking at it in light of Mr Fighty giving his spiel which the driver didn't know was coming. Camera-wise, Mr Fighty was filming the driver first, I think?

An example I have of ""well you could have done it differently"" is of indicating (via looking back and shaking my head) to a van driver that he was too close behind me when I was cycling. I didn't expect him to try and run me off the road, or to get out of his van and threaten to ""punch [my] fucking face in"" because he'd had a bad day. In hindsight, I should have just let him drive close to me (and put my life at risk) rather than antagonise him...

While I can understand your position, I don't think it can really apply in this situation. Not least because of how tricky it would be to move the bus like that! But mainly because of my ""fuckwit"" rule ;)

I use it as a pizza delivery car for Domino's and round town I can average 50mpg over a tank which for stop start traffic is bloody good for a 12 year old car.

Fojut on the other hand, whilst good when attacking the ball with his head, was soft in the tackle, easily outmuscled, and with dreadful positional awareness. Powerful and solid are two words I would never use to describe him. He looked both but he was neither.

The fact he won most of his headers - and therefore chipped in with a few goals - covered up a whole host of shortfalls in his game.

The best shop is marks and spencers (seriously) but it does have a really well stocked primark. If shopping or nightlife are your bag then coventry isnt the best.. However coventry is on the up (apparently) so you might feel differently on a visit. Warwick university is most definitely in coventry although it's out in the suburbs so about 10 mins out by car. At Warwick a car or bus will be your best friend especially as most 2nd or 3rd years live in Leamington which is 15/20 mins bus away. Leamington is alot nicer for shopping and nightlife although still hardly like Manchester or Leicester or London (or any other city based uni really). Warwick and Coventry also have a high proportion of foreign students. Exeter is a lot nicer for nightlife and shopping but like Warwick is out of town so you'll be walking lots in your 2nd and 3rd years. Incidentally it's alot warmer down south and you get trips to the beach :) Exeter has a reputation, like Warwick, or being stuffed full of rich white kids and whilst this is partly true you will find your own niche because the unis are so big. What tended to happen was you made friends via hall location and course and the halls are varied (in price) so you tend to find your level. I really can't stress enough the importance of visiting universities! If you make a pot luck then you could end up with a cohort of people who, sometimes literally, sometimes metaphorically, don't speak your language. A good friend went to one of the unis on your list but absolutely hated the ""small town"" nature of it. There was one club and that was it.

Maybe the communication broke down or that's how much you had out when you asked about paying with bitcoin. I'm sure he would appreciate a big bitcoin order. The whole point was to try and get the first few merchants that started to accept to see a benefit in terms of people (like you) who would support them because they accepted bitcoins.

If you are interested in doing the same in your area (it's a bit of work and most people think you're trying to con them) I can let you know the setup I use to allow someone to accept and for the bitcoins to go straight to you. Then you can sell them on somewhere like Bittylicious and make about 2%. The volume is not high. He's only done about Â£330 over the course of almost a year!, but it's just to get it visible on the street. If I have some spare time, I might try and do some more convincing around here. Hopefully if Bitcoin picks up a bit, the places that start accepting it first see some real benefit.

Guess how many friendly matches Wales played? None. 


Secondly, it massively weights the matches by 1 year increments, so the world cup final match 12 months ago in the last world cup is only worth 2x as much as friendly 11 months ago. 


Thirdly, it's completely out of sync - because of the timing issues and hte fact that tournament qualifiers are worth more, Wales has to try and qualify for the UEFA cup, but South American teams are guaranteed entry for the Copa America. That means Wales gets a load of 2.5x rated matches that South American teams work. 


Fourthly, As well as that, the regions are weighted by area - which is basically a fudge factor.

Good:

* Understated looks for the type of car it is - a bit of a sleeper compared to other hot hatches
* Cheap **to buy** at around Â£3500
* VAG 1.8t engine was really common from 1998-2005, so very easy to find parts and theres tons of information online
* Quick as a robbers dog

Bad:

* A bit thirsty at ~25mpg
* Tax is Â£280 a year
* 1.8t doesn't make a great noise compared to similarly powered V6s
* Not as reliable as I'd like
* Goddamn its an absolute moneysink: In the 3 years I've had it its had Â£2000 in repairs, a further Â£1000 in maintenance.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I get any further I want to clarify:  
I am neither unionist/loyalist/nationalist/republicanand do not support intolerance, bigotry or anything of the sort from any person or people.   
The name im posting under is tongue in cheek.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Right, my report on what its been like to be living in proximity to the bonfire:

&amp;nbsp;

Who is building it:   
I've seen adults, teens and children, of all genders, contributing to the building of this bonfire.

&amp;nbsp;

The state of the area:  
Up until today, the place looked like a bomb site. Pallets - and pieces of pallets lay strewn all over the place, rubbish dumped everywhere, smaller fires which have been lit throughout the duration of the construction have led to scorch marks on the ground, up walls and the debris just left there or kicked all over the footpath. At least one lamppost has been gutted and wrecked. Tattered, scorched flegs fly four per lamppost. From this morning I noticed a concerted effort to tidy the place up. Theyve been stacking the pallets and even sweeping up the footpath.

&amp;nbsp;

  
Anti Social Behavior:  
Its rife. Anyone brave enough to still venture upon the green despite the obstacle course thats been created will experience harassment and intimidation, i've seen it happen to others and have been subjected to it myself. Drug dealing takes place out in the open. The majority of those involved in the building of the bonfire spend a significant amount of time doing drugs and getting very, very drunk. Banging on doors and windows, shouting obscenities etc can and usually does carry on to 3-4am. As i've stated before they have been lighting smaller fires every night during its construction which has led to fumes from these smaller fires entering homes at night, causing respiratory issues as well as making the entire building stink of burnt rubber. I have spoken with other residents who also share a dislike of the state of the green and footpaths, the proximity of the bonfire to their homes, and the anti social behavior accompanying it.

&amp;nbsp;

Any questions, fire away.

Talking about Sharia law is about the same as talking about UK law - it's so much more complicated than a single set of rules that are all absolute and consistent. 

Then there are many different interpretations of how to apply it, the main factors that correlate with the administration of these laws seeming to be prosperity and education. Some countries think every single law in the Koran should be applied, some just the civil, some the legal, some think they should be applied, but adjusted to fit better with the modern developed world...so it's no where near as simple as ""what would happen if sharia law(s) were introduced in the uk"" (they already are in some form, same as the laws of every other religion present). There is no ""official"" interpretation of the Koran.



Yes, if you look at the middle east, and the people influenced by hardline extremist sects, there are atrocities being carried out. This is not the majority of Muslims by a long way, and nor is there a large impact in Europe or America from religious crime full stop. We're more at risk from extreme right wing/authoritarian groups than we are from all religious groups. Christ, our own government appear to have gotten away with murder, rape racism and far more just in our recent history! I don't think there are even studies published that ask whether Muslims are comparably more likely to do any of the things you have mentioned, and I doubt we ever will given how complex a question that is.

As for it getting worse, and us being exterminated (could you clarify who you mean by 'we'?); it's been shown in studies that Muslims in the UK are becoming more integrated, and less likely to commit crime over time. Same as every other group, as more get a better education, a more stable life and employment, the better off the community as a whole gets. British culture, people, Christianity, Europeans and (liberal, democratic) Western ideals are not at risk of extermination. We aren't being invaded. There isn't a dominant, successful campaign of any sorts against us.

That will give you a few qualifications, including a BSc in Airline Transport Management. An MPL course will run you between 60-90k, depending on your skill. This is paid by the pilot, usually with an aviation bank loan. During this time the student also has to provide themselves with accommodation and food etc.

After that, you can start as a junior first officer if Easyjet offer you a job. With this route though, you're limited to only flying a specific aircraft type (so you couldn't get a job with Ryanair for example). Once you get on board and start flying revenue flights for an airline, the pay will jump to around 40k usually.

We fucked around for too long and dropped the ball for sure.

It wasn't anything to do with Signing Harry Kewell, more frustratingly it was because we'd just signed Pongolle and Le Tallec that we couldn't agree to Ronaldo's demands as it would have seemed too unfair to them hence why negotiations dragged on and we got sniped by United.

&gt;The European Union Times claims to be a news site.

It even has lots of mainstream advertising served by ContextWeb! Eminently respectable to all appearances.

&gt;Upon closer inspection, however, it is little more than a compiler and regurgitator of various news stories and a particularly unpleasant far-right-leaning blog. The reporting is, without exception, shockingly unprofessional. Do not be fooled by the nice WordPress theme â this is utter neo-Nazi bollocks.

Did a postgrad diploma in a shameless IT-call-centre-filler of a course at a converted polytechnic, and discovered I was quite good at it. That led to a couple of interesting junior developer interviews, and the one I actually took, which resulted in a good few years of being over-stressed and under-paid.

I learnt Korean when I was much younger and this is certainly helping me get back to that level. The video has now been watched over 40,000 times, amazing! As i'm sure you know, the Koreans really respect (extremely) hard work to achieve ones goals and the strong sense of family/community. Those values tie in pretty closely with Southampton, so it's not all that surprising that they're drawn to the Saints. Hoping to get to Korea for the first time myself in 2016.

We were top of the league around early November last year I'm sure after a 3-0 win against St. Mirren at Tannadice. Souttar was out injured from pre-season until late November. He never featured at all in our best patch of form last season. And even when he returned he wasn't overly influential. For a point of reference, our best performances at Tannadice last season - 2-1 against Celtic in December and 6-2 against Dundee on New Years Day, Souttar featured in neither. And then of course we went on our awful patch.

Fair enough he featured heavily in the previous season (2013/2014) when we went on our run of scoring at least 4 goals in however many successive matches. But, you could argue that while we were impressive that season we were much more effective in the season just past as we actually challenged Aberdeen and Celtic until our great downfall.

But yeah, we can agree he is obviously vastly more comfortable in midfield.

Got to say, I think it's mad to say that Fojut was a terrible defender for us (although, keep in mind I did earlier concede that he had a bad end to the season but that can easily be contributed to the overall team morale and of course his own personal problems). I have looked at every single one of the goals we conceded many, many times seing them first hand and being an Arabzone subscriber and you could easily trace most of our shortcomings in defence last year to Watson and Dillon. In my opinion it was no secret that until McGowan came along teams targeted our right back as our weak link, although saying that Dixon hasn't been outstanding since returning but hopefully he can rectify that after a good pre-season.

Look at UKIP's recent surge in vote, they got 4 million votes in the general election and no seats, then the party imploded. 

The percentage of Muslims in the UK will never be high enough to form a majority government in the commons they'd need 34% of votes at a minimum, not all muslims would vote for them either, so you'd need Islam at about 40-45% at least. In the last census they numbered ~2,706,066, ~4.5% of the total population, they'd need a growth of 1000% which seems extremely improbable at best. 

They'd then need another a 10-20 years to get a majority in the lords which would be a constant delay until they got there. There would then be legal challenges to the supreme court and ECHR which they'd need to wait another few years until the judges see out their tenure.

I did answer your question, in-depth relative to your post as well.


As I said above, it would depend on how they were implemented. Quoting the scripture is useless, as you could interpret it completely differently to how a British political party who based their beliefs on Islam would. There is no way to get close to answering that question, unless you want a very long dissertation on the interpretations and implementations of Sharia law - even then that wouldn't give us the answer you want, as there is not a major political party that bases its beliefs on Islam.

If you would care to explain why you feel so threatened by a religion, why Islam is so bad, or anything else you have raised, then be my guest.

As for what I really think will happen? With regards to Islam in Europe: increase of the percentage of the population who identify as Muslim, the trend of  an increase of instability/tension/problems as large influxes of migrants settle in an area, followed by a gradual decrease of these issues over time will continue as it always has.",null,0,null,1436480842,null,0,false,0,csxxv5q,null,t3_3cpthy,null,t1_csxxv5q,null,t1_csxx0lp,null,null,null,1437723972,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

We decided to head to Westfield's in Sheppard's Bush in London as there's an Inglot shop. There was a lot of arm swatching, comparing, splurging and restraint. 

Linked are some swatches I did on my arm in natural daylight, none wet this time, but IME of foiling some of the duo chrome types, OMG LOOOOVE! Thoughts in italics :D

* **Kiko Infinity+ Sparkle Eyeshadow in '405'** *not really had a play with this, but I plan to try it over some dark purples*
* **Inglot Eyeshadow Matte in '343'** *holy shit, this stuff shows up a dream on me* without *white pencil under neath. It's pigmented, easy to blend, doesn't look chalky. GORGEOUS! I'm honestly looking to just buying single mattes from Inglot to fill in gaps in my colour collection, especially paler colours.*
* **Kiko Infinity High Pigmented Eyeshadow in '208'** *I really like this red, it's not too bright, but it's still a bright red, blends nicely and works a treat for the Hunger Games inspired eyes I've been rocking of late*
* **Top Shop Chameleon Glow in 'Shuffle the Cards'** *Holy Grail of Duo Chromes, I honestly never thought I would spend Â£9 on an eyeshadow from TopShop, but this stuff is bloody amazing! It's super sparkly, like... if someone got a duo chrome nail polish an poured it over Ed Cullen, and his fancy vampy sparkle decided it needed to out do the duo chrome and it all came together as a beautiful glistening orange pinky gold beautiful sunset of a humanoid. This is the eyeshadow.*
* **Inglot Body Pigment Powder in '126'** *naughty, I know but this stuff with some MUA Awesome Liquid does an amazing eyeliner, shows up beautifully with no white eye pencil underneath. This is just gorgeous. I need to do some more tropical sunset eye looks and use this one.*
* **Inglot AMC Eyeshadow in '62'** *this is a really nice not bright, but not ark silver. I haven't worked with it much, but what I did use of it as an outer and crease against a bright silver it worked treat.*
* **Inglot AMC Pure Pigment Eyeshadow in '84'** *This pigment is my new bestie!! It's like, a lovely lively green gold version of MAC's Blue Brown Pigment. It's so, so gorgeous and pretty and I've used this one the most out of all my haul since buying it. I really like this against my yellow undertones, it's still got a brick brown darkish under colour to it, but it's like spring to MAC's blue- brown's autumn. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Also works a treat with some MUA Awesome liquid.*
* **Barry M Dazzle Dust in 'Petrol Black 98'** *I haven't really given this a proper try, but the swatches of it foiled I've seen online put this on my to buy list that day. I really like Barry M's loose shadows, and I think they don't get enough love or mentions on here. There are some gorgeous colours, with beautiful shimmers and they've always foiled well for me.*
* **LA Color Glossy Lips Sheer Lipgloss in 'Cinnamon Bun CLG912'** *I wanted a copper lipgloss, I got a copper lipgloss. Can't really comment on the longevity, as I've not given that much attention. But for a cheap lipgloss it doesn't have that horrible tacky feel some lipglosses do and the colour payoff per layer is pretty decent.*
* **LA Color Lipstick in 'Matte Brick' LIPM234'** *wanted to experiment with some new lip colours and I like how these turn out, not patchy at all and last fine. I think both colours are gorgeous- really nice darkish reds on me, and like pairing them with the green-brown Inglot pigment in 84.*
* **LA Color Lipstick in 'Berry Red LIPC116'** *as above*
* **Urban Decay 24/7 Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner in 'Siren'** *this stuff lasts forever! It looks different on me in different lights, sometimes more green sometimes more blue. My major qualm with this is the brush applicator, some of the bristle are all bent up already, and  although it glides well it's harder to control the amount of product on the tip compared to my fav below. This eyeliner is defo a one coater though, which is a huge plus!* 
* **Kiko Super Color Eyeliner in '109'** *A replacement for my previous one which is pretty much giving up the ghost. I honestly cannot remember the last time I rebought the exact same product whilst it was still stocked because I used it all up. I love the soft, long, tapered felt nib, I love the duo chrome of the glitters- it looks one colour on the middle an another colour to the sides when I eye line with it. Two layers usually does me right. This is my go to when I want a vibrant but simple look, usually paired with gold shadow in the inner corners, dark golds/ for the outer and crease, and some purple mascara. This stuff. Bootiful! If you're looking for a colourful eyeliner, I'd defiantly recommend giving this a try. Oh, and balls! I love that these have shaking balls in, so the pigment etc doesn't settle!*
* **Kiko Super Color Eyeliner in '101'** *pretty much as awesome as above, but in gold. Two layers, and I'm happy!*
* **Maybelline Eye Studio Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner in '02 Brown'** *Decided to get a brown eyeliner for when I want less stark looks. Long time fav of my sib, I'm happy with it- it oesn't transfer, it stays where I put it. The formula is nice to work with allowing me to apply and stuff without drying too quickly, nor too slowly. The brush it comes with is decent, but I prefer my thin, angle eyeliner brush. The wings this gives me are lush. Can confirm: not best used as a brow products if in a fix :(*
* **Bobbie Brown SPF15 Tinted Moisturiser in 'Medium to Dark Tint'** *Yay! I think I prefer this to the BB cream by Bobbie Brown I have (albeit in a paler colour for the winter). It's just nice, and yellow and evens out my skin a bit without covering up my freckles. It plays nicely with the hyluronic acid stuff I use on my skin. Keeps me dewy which I like.*",null,0,null,1436480845,null,0,1436481614,0,csxxv85,null,t3_3cq3i7,null,t1_csxxv85,null,t3_3cq3i7,null,null,null,1437723973,null,2,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,2,null

Of the clients on his roster, Sterling is almost surely the biggest name. It makes a certain, perverse kind of sense that in the scramble to establish himself as a big name agent, he would use the biggest client on his roster to do so.

Of course, if this is how you conduct business as an agent, then it probably doesn't look very attractive so maybe my theory doesn't hold much water but Ward having started his agency in about 2013 14, I'm sure him wanting to make his business plays some part in the Sterling saga.

&amp;nbsp;

Do you fear for you family this time of year?  
If I had family here I would. I imagine there are families that do as there are kids ive seen about who I have never once seen at the bonfire. What is a shock is how many young children are involved with it. Whether their parents don't know, don't care or perhaps even support it I do not know, and I do not know which of those three options is the most unpleasant.

&amp;nbsp;

What sort of intimidating tactics are people using to defend the bonfires?    
I don't know if the bonfires are being defended per se. But the people there will glare, leer and verbally harass anyone with the gall to use the footpath for its intended purpose and walk by them as the build/drink/deal/take drugs. Their body language etc has always given me the impression they felt as if they themselves were the ones being judged for their actions and not the bonfire itself. Kind of like how a kid might be aware of his own guilt and be defensive about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Is there a genuine hatred towards a nationalist or a catholic person or is it ""showing off""?  
From my experience I think there is an element of both. Walking by, I have heard children of whom i estimate to be between the ages of 5-12 discussing what phrases to put on signs around the bonfire, slogans like ""Fuck the Pope"", ""Poles Out"" and ""Kill All Taigs"" were examples they offered one another. I was shocked. To hear kids of such a young age talk about things like that blew me away. The older people involved, I think they are being led on by those claiming the Shinners, Parades Commission, PSNIRA, Illuminati etc are all stomping and suppressing their 'culture'.

&amp;nbsp;

...how people who live day in day out near this stuff this time of year deal with it?  
Keep our heads down and try to get on with daily life without attracting the attention of the people involved with the bonfire.

It is normally the tenant's responsibility to inform the council they they are resident and liable for council tax. Not doing so doesn't suddenly make you exempt. Sometimes, landlords will do this for you. This case is more prevalent in student accommodation because they forget to do it themselves.

If your contract says that your landlord will pay your council tax, or if you otherwise have evidence of this (not just your memory or hearsay), then you can hold them to it. If not, let this be your lesson to get things in writing.

It sounds like you do in fact live in an HMO, as you are unrelated 'households' as the law calls them, sharing communal areas. One way to know is whether you have locks on your doors - if yes, then that's a rather blatant example of separate households. If your landlord is trying to circumvent the HMO license fee and restrictions, the council would like to know.

But the above point is a little moot - you are all responsible for the council tax according to most councils. There will be a price band applied to your house as a whole, and then how you divide that up is your choice, just as it is with any other bill. It's probably fair to divide it up into months, and then those months by the number of people living there.

The only way you get a discount on council tax is if some of you are students, or if you live alone. Otherwise, it sucks but you've gotta pay.

Nicest car (imo) that I could buy with the budget I set myself as a first car. Looks aren't bad, doesn't set the world alight but as it is my first car it has captured my heart anyway.

Likes: Good handling, lots of little extras that make life a bit easier, like heated windshields, auto lights and wipers, electric folding mirrors. Ford so generally good value on parts, average build quality but at least it isn't french.

Dislikes: Engine isn't terrible or anything but I had to restrict myself to a 1.25 so insurance wasn't a joke. The electric door mirrors are slightly broken so when I lock the car they carry on trying to fold in when they're folded as far as they can go so they click a lot, which is annoying.

Bought used 2 days ago, performs exceptionally well at 1.3v and I think would be seriously good under water.

null,false,B23vital,null,null,null,"&gt;You can't say Â£50,000 isn't a lot just because a house in London is worth Â£1,000,000. Those two things are unrelated?

How can you possibly say these two things are unrelated? 
You go to work to earn a living to provide for yourself and your family, which includes renting or owning a home.
The reason London workers get paid more than the rest of the country is due to the fact that the cost of living is higher in London than any other city in the UK. So naturally people get paid more compared to their counter parts that live in a different city. 
Regardless of this, the starting wage for a qualified train driver is 35k rising to 60k+. So for comparison, they're getting paid above or equal to market rate across the country, when to factor in that most London workers get paid more than counterparts elsewhere, they are actually receiving an average wage for that job role across the country.

https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/TrainDriver.aspx

&gt;Â£50,000 is far above average for everywhere in the UK.

Im not denying this, 50k is above average, but not in this specific job role. Its actually similar or at market rate for the country. Taking that into account they are being paid a fair wage. 
The whole argument is that the company want them to work more hours, late &amp;amp;amp; night shifts for no premium, which most companies usually pay. Like i said in another comment, my company pay me a premium for working night shift because its unsociable hours, their argument is they wont get that privilege.

secondly this is about two disputes: one about the closing of ticket offices (despite increasingly demand for them, and increasing (by 44%) assaults and crimes against them and other stations users, including the public), the other about the extension of the underground - on some lines - to a 24hour service from september this year.

The new system is set up so you can take out a liveable amount whoever you are. The unfair thing I'm referring to isn't that some people had free money and some people had it as loans, it's that some people had Â£3k to live off for a year and could get no more, and some people had Â£9k once grants and bursaries came in. The idea that my parents were in any position to be giving me Â£6k is a joke, I got a few bags of shopping when I was going back after visiting home once a term, and they gave me a couple hundred when I started. But beyond that I had to save everything from work during the summer to have anything, and before my second year, my job covering for someone was ended when they recovered really quickly and so I was no longer needed so I barely got any work that summer.

I get that some people work during term, but it's not recomended (some uni's prohibit it) as statistically it lowers your final degree marks by quite a bit. By the time I realised how bad my situation had become, there were NO jobs that didn't require lecture time shifts or previous bar experience. That said, I ended up doing odd jobs quite a bit just to get some decent food or to be able to afford some shoes when they fell apart (literally, the sole came off in the middle of the street, and I couldn't afford to get any new shoes, so I ended up having to skip a few lectures and just read notes at home so that I didn't have to go in with half a shoe, and then made a few weed deals for a guy for some cash). That's the shit that happens when you only have access to Â£3k a year when you're supposed to be studying full time.

At the same time, there were people all around me blowing cash like there was no tomorrow. 

Am I envious that I spent months at a time eating rice and peas plus whatever I could scavenge from a messy living room whilst other people were getting drunk each night and asking why I never came out? Yes, I would probably have had a much better experience in uni had I not been constantly trying to make money or find food.

you've answered your own complain. Join or start a union branch in your workplace. Employers aren't just doing to dole out freely better wages and conditions, they don't act in your interests but for their profit margins, and would prefer you to live in squalor as long as you're productive. If you want a life that's worth living, that gives to at least some security and some pension in old age then **you** have to act. Capital has progressively attacked the strength of the trade union movement over the last 30 years, and it's only now seeing it's strength pick up again (over 200,000 new union members last year). But like under capitalism is defined by a repetitive assurance that you are powerless to effect much of what really concerns you.

[Last warning.](#s ""Eleven went to Trenzalore in the Town called Christmas. The defied the Papal Mainframe by bringing his Tardis with him by hiding a key on him and summoning it remotely. In Christmas, he found a crack in the wall which was transmitting a message through all space &amp; time; from before the universe until after it, this question was being asked. It was translated by a decapitated cyberman named Handles by Eleven, and was translated to all creatures in the wide range area. The question was... 'Doctor Who?'"")

[Last Warning Pt. 2](#s ""The Leader of the Church of the Papal Mainframe, whose name I don't remember, immediately had an 'unscheduled change of faith' - the church, from that moment on, was dedicated to one singular cause: silence, that the question scattered through all space &amp; time [the oldest question in the universe], would never be answered. In respect to this choice, the Kovarian sect of the Church split off and went on a way to stop the Doctor ever coming to Trenzalore in the first place. To do this, Madame Kovarian engineered a psychopath to kill him - River Song. And in the end, they very well blew up his Tardis to stop him."")

[Final part.](#s ""The blowing up of the Tardis was the cause of the cracks we saw all throughout Eleven's timeline. Because they followed the Tardis through the past &amp; future, one of the cracks ended up on the Byzantium. Whether or not this was why it crashed is arguable, but anyway - the Weeping Angels, aside from Angel Bob, were too weak to send people back in time. In The Angels Take Manhatten, The Doctor points out that an Angel with scars was too weak to send River back in time, meaning Angels nearly starved definitely couldn't. Originally they were feeding off the radiation from the Byzantium, but once they got into it, they didn't actually kill anyone else. The crack opened wide enough that the remaining soldiers just walked into it and were never born, and then the Doctor sent all the Angels into it by turning off the artificial gravity. The only reason Angel Bob didnt send them back in time was so he could speak to them and try to make the Doctor angry. Unfortunately for them, it worked."")",null,0,null,1436486290,null,0,false,0,csy0y82,null,t3_3cm7cq,null,t1_csy0y82,null,t3_3cm7cq,null,null,null,1437726191,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

Until she started at this school she was very well behaved. A bit wimpy maybe, but one of those kids who would spend all her pocket money on sweets for other people, and could be guaranteed to stand up for other people. In fact, even at this school, in between the detentions, she got a lot of praise for getting in between a group of boys who were physically attacking another boy, and daring them to hit a girl, which put an end to it. (This happened out of school on the bus, and the boys parents came into school to make the teachers aware.)

I've calmed down quite a lot from my anger when I posted earlier, and when she got home (an hour late due to a detention) I didn't shout at her, and did make a point of saying that whilst I was happy that she was more confident I wasn't happy with all the ways she was choosing to display it.

I did still make her write an essay about the attacks, with an apology note for holding up the I am boring sign during the silence, to hand in to her teachers tomorrow - I want them to know I'm taking it seriously, and indeed for her to know the same. And she has still lost her phones for the remainder of the school term, as well as severely reduced computer and TV privileges. She still won't be having a big birthday party as we had planned, but I have decided that IF she gets no more detentions in that period AND her teachers confirm her behaviour has improved I may let her have a couple of friends sleep over.

I've also arranged to have a meeting at the school regarding their detention policy. At the moment incidents are logged in a book, and then passed on to one member of staff in charge of detentions, with detentions sometimes not being booked in for up to a week after an incident - I think in part this is contributing to the problem as by the time she has a detention, and I've been informed she has one, she's forgotten what its for in the first place. You wouldn't train a dog not to take a shit on the carpet if you randomly shouted at it a week after the event, after all! At the very least, they do need to be calling me if she misbehaves so that I can tackle the issue immediately she gets home.

He has a contract, hand in a transfer request and let clubs put in their bids. What he's doing at the moment is about money and nothing else.

But he hasn't.

It matters not whether we were more effective last season, I was talking about the spell over the last two seasons that United played their best football. There are no two ways about it - it was when Souttar was at centre half. My contention is that a massive part of that good play came down to Souttar's ability to pass and play it out from the back. If you want to dispute my point, dispute that. Don't go rambling off about what he did or didn't do last season, or how effective the team was when he wasn't in it.

null,false,mosestrod,null,null,null,"I guess I would just say that remember technology doesn't advance on it's own to some mystical end-point, it advances via capitalism and thus only advances insofar as it's profitable. For example we had better electric cars in the 1990s than today. We have lightbulbs that could last 100s of years. We have super-long-life tarmac and road surfaces which could survive hundreds of years. Yet none of this stuff, despite the potential given by technology, is in use. Why? Because of capitalism. Companies that introduce or sell these things cut of their basis for future profit (i.e. a lightbulb company that sells 100 year lightbulbs will be out of business soon since they've undermined the basis of their profit, i.e. the purchase of lightbulbs). This together with [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) means our actual technological capabilities are in reality held back from the benefits they could offer us all by the profit-motive. 

Similarly, even if it's inevitable, we can't expect capitalism to go slowly or quietly. People will have to fight for technologies that free them from work, from capital, they won't simply be given â an in the meantime we need to make sure technology doesn't end up making work worse (i.e. spending all day in front of a computer etc.). We need to make sure that technology helps, rather than hurts, humans. When it's used at the service of capital it too often is used to hurt, increasing unemployment or increasing productive wealth whilst reducing most peoples abilities to actually experience it. Only people acting together can overcome these contradictions and make the promise of technology *real*.

If people are genuinely starving in Greece that speaks only to the sheer incompetence that allows them to have a far more generous pension than their current economic situation allows, but also apparently not feed the entire population. 

Syriza's reaction to tax evasion is....lenient. They throw in the whole ""We'll tackle big business!"" which every government does and like most governments haven't really done anything on that. And they ignore the whole host of other tax evasion issues Greece has. Christ, they want to write off much of the backdebt of individual unpaid taxes and campaigned on not raising taxes. 

To say Greece's tax issues are a small part of a larger issue is to ignore the fact the country only needs bail outs and the austerity that brings precisely because the money they lose through not bringing in tax means they have a shortfall that requires these bailouts. It's a complete farce. 

Or the Eurozone could do as you seem to suggest would be right and allow Greece these never ending bail outs that only serve to prevent them actually doing anything, which causes the GDP to plumett, and the issues relating to their economic crisis to get even worse.

The Doctor is the main draw to the show, perhaps more now than it ever has. PEople come for the performance of the Doctor. Nobody comes for the Doctor (and *certainly* nobody comes for Clara). Remove the Doctor and you've got this gaping hole of entertainment to fill. So how do you fill it? How to you keep it interesting?

Well, you could go the way of *Blink* and fill it with a serviceable slice-of-life look at an average life (similar to *Love and Monsters*) and pair it with a **great concept**. 

The Angels, and the temporal dynamic of messages being left for someone from the past, work a one-two punch of high-concept storytelling that creates more than enough interest to take the place of the Doctor's role. While every episode of Doctor Who should have these, it's important in these episodes for the concepts to work particularly well, as they have to stand without the Doctor to hold them up with interactions and explanations.

The other road to take is to fill it up with a very focused, very powerful, **character driven story** like *Turn Left*. Focus on a companion and push them to the limit. The removal of the Doctor is now the removal of the show's security blanket. Things get dark and dicey without the lovable Doctor to pull people out of the fire, and the episode should work with that.

null,false,Gleb_Tsipursky,null,null,null,"First, a big THANK YOU to all members of this subreddit who provided support and feedback for my writing of my book, Find Your Purpose Using Science! Itâs a workbook that combines an engaging narrative, stories from people's lives, and research-informed exercises and worksheets designed to help people you cultivate a rich sense of meaning and purpose. It draws on my scholarship on meaning and purpose, and my experience as a science popularizer and activist reason. Iâm donating most of the profit to [Intentional Insights](http://intentionalinsights.org/), a nonprofit devoted to reason activism, where I also volunteer as President.

Iâm putting my money where my mouth is by expressing my gratitude to all the members of this subreddit tangibly, through giving you free access to my book before selling it to the broader public starting on July 14. Feel free to share with your friends if you think they would be interested. 

The link leads you to the book blog, and if you click on the Amazon purchase button at the top of the blog, you will go to the Amazon page with the free book. 

My goal is to be useful and bring value to fellow reason-oriented people, so **I'd really appreciate your feedback here on how you think this workbook can be useful, and to whom.** I'm targeting it to those who are going through the process of searching for their meaning and purpose, an experience especially powerful for those who are questioning or recently left religion and youth and young adults in particular. 

Here are the endorsements from reason-oriented notables with their thoughts about the value of this book:

*Dr. Tsipursky has done a terrific job approaching this important topic from a scientific perspective. He not only demonstrates that we donât need to imagine the supernatural to find a purpose in life, but he shows how modern research in fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide demonstrable strategies that allow us to create a purposeâour own purpose.*
- **Dr. Bo Bennett** holds a Doctorate in Psychology, hosts âThe Dr. Bo Show,â and wrote *Logically Fallacious* and *Year to Success*
 
*A unique and intriguing project, well-researched, and well worth your testing out in practice. No one has done anything like this before. And it's a field much in need of work like this.*
- **Dr. Richard Carrier** holds a Doctorate in History and wrote *Sense and Goodness without God* and *On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt*
 
*Dr. Tsipursky has done a great job bringing the power of meaning and purpose to the rational and scientific among us.*
- **Tim Kelley** is Founder of the True PurposeÂ® Institute and wrote *True Purpose:  Twelve Strategies for Discovering the Difference You Are Meant to Make*
 
*Perhaps you have wondered to yourself, âWhat is my meaning and purpose in life?â If so, you have plenty of company in the wondering department but may struggle to come up with answers to that question. Well, if you are ready to explore, then Gleb Tsipurskyâs workbook, Find Your Purpose Using Science, may be just what you are looking for to get the exploration going. Tsipursky, a college professor and scholar of scientific and research-based approaches to answering big questions has put together a step by step guide to help you reflect on what you really and truly care about, match that with what you are actually doing with your life, and set up a plan to move toward more meaningful and purposeful living. Along the way, Tsipursky highlights the personal stories of people who, as he does himself, discover unexpected and positive energy for living life in a meaningful and fulfilling way.*
- **Bart Worden** is the Executive Director of the American Ethical Union
 
*Find Your Purpose Using Science clearly is one of the centerpieces of humanist education, and it should be. In my position as an American Humanist Association Education Consultant and former Director of the Kochhar Humanist Education Center, I am in the most fortunate position of recommending it to the AHAâs chapters and affiliates. It should serve as one of the centerpieces of our educational program since it provides clear and practical research-based strategies for figuring out a personal sense of lifeâs meaning and purpose.*
- **Dr. Bob Bhaerman** holds a Doctorate of Education with a specialty in curricular development and is an American Humanist Association Educational Consultant and former Director of the Kochhar Humanist Education Center
  
*Professor Tsipursky shows us that, while there is no obvious purpose to life, meaning is ours for the making. Science shows us how meaning-making is important for our happiness, and especially how community helps us discover what truly fulfills us, then helps us act on it.*
- **Maria Greene** is the Executive Director of the Unitarian Universalist Humanist Association
  
Dr. Gleb Tsipursky departs from the affirmation of the late Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, which suggests that the scientific method and religious approaches are differing magisteria, that is, they are asking distinct sets of questions, which, even when they overlap a bit, remain focused on different values. In Tsipurskyâs view, justice issues, meaning, value and even purpose issues, which are central to many religious people, can be generated very clearly from evidence based studies that use the scientific method. For conservative evangelicals like Rick Warren, there can be no purpose without a biblical warrant. Dr. Tsipursky, without rancor, demonstrates successfully to my mind that this is simply not true, and that one can live not only an ethical and moral life without religion, but a responsible, compassionate and justice-seeking life. I found it insightful throughout.
- **Rev. Dr. Mark Belletini** holds a Doctorate of Divinity Degree, is himself a humanist, is a senior minister at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbus, and wrote *Nothing Gold Can Stay: The Colors of Grief*
 
*Find Your Purpose Using Science is an effective reason-based path to deepen meaning and connect with your life's purpose.  Using techniques supported by his own research and that of dozens of other scholars, Dr. Tsipursky guides readers through proven purpose discovery exercises. With his warm, engaging, and vulnerable style he shares his own personal struggle, and that of many others, to reconcile the world of science and reason with the more elusive and subtle pingings of the human heart â to create a life that is larger than oneself.*
- **Brandon Peele**, Global Purpose Advocate, PlanetPurpose.org, Founder &amp; Purpose Coach, The EVR1 Institute
 
 
*Dr. Gleb Tsipurskyâs book Find Your Purpose Using Science provides a great overview of the subject. It is a must read for those who are charting their trajectory in life and are seeking to create their own meaning and purpose.*
- **Mark W. Gura** is a TV/radio Host, the Executive Director of the Association of Mindfulness Meditation and Secular Buddhism, and wrote *Exploring Your Life: Mindfulness Meditation and Secular Spirituality* and *Atheist Meditation Atheist Spirituality*.
 
 
*Filled with thought provoking exercises as well information on what research has shown works to provide meaning and purpose to peopleâs lives. While Dr. Tsipursky doesnât answer the question of what your purpose in life is, he does guide you so that you can discover for yourself what your highest order goals really are. Knowing what you really want to accomplish in life provides a foundation for you to live your life, fully and with purpose.*

But things like social media and getting booed wont stick.. the last few games Sterling has played he was booed every single touch, that will not stick for long if he moves/changes his ways. Neither will all of the constant abuse he receives via text messages/Twitter and all of that other shit which is fairly important nowadays.

&gt;Nobody thinks business is ""drinking tea and being polite"". 

Really, because I've seen a LOT of people on here think that just because Aidy Ward is a cunt that must mean he's a bad agent. It's very much possible to be a top agent and a complete cunt just like Raiola.

&gt;And yes, we would be selling to City for 50 million regardless of this. Why? Because that is a shed load of money for him and FSG are business people, aka they love their tea

The move also strengthens a direct rival, and would make us a bigger selling club than we already are, we already lost our best player last summer - I'm pretty sure the club would prefer not to lose another very important player this summer especially since we're losing Gerrard in the same summer. What kind of message does it send to our players/prospective signings if we're losing so many important players...

&gt;Sterling's camp could have let us know he wanted to leave without acting as he has.

Like Suarez did? we made it extremely clear that he wasn't for sale no matter the price and yes Suarez &gt; Sterling etc but that's irrelevant. We didn't let Suarez leave even though he  wanted to, we didn't even try negotiate with Arsenal/other clubs... simply because we didn't want to strengthen a direct rival or be known as a selling club.

&gt;Are you seriously advocating everything they've done? What if he doesn't get his move? What then? You seem to think business is cut and dry. It isn't.

Nope but the whole thing could have been avoided if the club didn't leak the contract negotiations, that's the only reason Sterling went to the BBC.

&gt; THE number of students at Scottish colleges has fallen by more than 100,000 in the past three years, with hours of learning cut by almost 10 million, new figures show.

&gt;Staff numbers have also dropped by almost 7,000, according to a series of key facts published by education body Colleges Scotland.

&gt; The figures follow a series of college mergers that created 10 larger regionalised institutions as part of the Scottish Governmentâs wider post-16 education reforms.

Unfortunately, if you want to make tuition at university free for students, you need to find the money from somewhere else - as noted in [this Guardian piece](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/2014/sep/24/nicola-sturgeon-faces-cuts-and-hard-choices-as-domestic-realities-bite-at-holyrood) from just after the referendum:

&gt; Labour is likely to resurrect one of its central attacks on Salmondâs domestic policies: the funding cuts to Scotlandâs FE colleges and the loss of 120,000 college places, and the damage on efforts to tackle urban deprivation and under-employment.

&gt; They insist those cuts, essentially to help fund university tuition fees and higher education policy, were hitting the poorest the hardest by increasing the debts they needed to take out by Â£32m, undermining his partyâs claim to represent progressive, social democrat politics.

&gt; There is also a surge in student debt and its impact on poorer undergraduates and college students: it emerged during the referendum campaign that student debt in Scotland had jumped by 58% or Â£160m, to Â£436m â the highest annual increase seen in the UK.

&gt; Up to date student debt figures for the last full academic year are due out in October and are likely to be higher still. Further evidence shows that the restructuring of student maintenance grants in 2012 and using debt far more to fund living costs, was disproportionately hitting ooorer students.

Greece's tax issues have existed for years and because of previous corrupt governments that people didn't want to pay tax to. The tax issue is historical as well as cultural and will require time and effort to fix. 

Most of bailouts have gone to paying off debts and loans and not helping people. The austerity and various conditions attached to loans and bailouts under previous government have hindered growth, increased Greece's debt to GDP ratio, and well, made things worse. Now they have so much debt that they can't pay it off even if they collect all their taxes magically, they don't have the money. They need debt relief and investment before they can tackle the issues they face.

They've backed down for emergency money, but the problem will continue due to conditions attached, just watch.

It's staggering that a developed nation has been run so poorly. I mean this is a country who just completely borrowed so unbelievably recklessly with sheer disregard for the future. The banks might have caused the problems in the first place but its really sheer incompetence that has led to Greece being so much worse off than pretty much every other country involved in the crisis.

It shouldn't be magic to get a decent tax system. Granted Greece has a very high percentage of self employment which makes things more difficult, but self employment should not have a country on its knees. Greece needs its bailouts precisely because of the shortfall caused by tax evasion. I mean don't get me wrong, it clearly isn't the only issue and the whole problem of the Euro is going to need sorting out too, but short term and long term the tax issue is huge. I would have sympathy for the view that maybe the economy could be stimulated if the country hadn't been so repeatedly useless at even the most basic of state functions. 

Greece's standard of living has taken a hit for sure, but how exactly do you explain to the countries surrounding Greece that live within their means, have a decent, improving, economic situation but a lower standard of living as a result, that Greece should keep getting loans from them and other eurozone countries, but also don't want to actually have the whole living within their means part of the equation.

I have every sympathy for the ordinary people in Greece who paid their taxes and the young people who are facing a doomed future there. But I don't see how the situation improves for them unless you pretty much force Greece to start doing something about its situation itself. Otherwise I just don't see how you can justify to the taxpayers in another country that the bailout is required because a significant proportion of the population of Greece doesn't want to bother with taxes. If Greece got its act together and still problems existed you'd have to say fine, clearly somethings not working and we need to go about this a different way, but the simple fact is Greece is not anywhere near that point itself either.",null,0,null,1436491189,null,0,1436492395,0,csy3jba,null,t3_3cpc3w,null,t1_csy3jba,null,t1_csy2lhj,null,null,null,1437728156,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I am completely able bodied and therefore willingly give up my seat to anyone even minorly less capable than me e.g the elderly or the pregnant.

I have a couple of friends who use wheelchairs, one has severe cerebral palsy and has a motorised wheelchair as they can't walk at all, clearly they would have priority over just about anyone.

Another has some difficulty walking, but is capable of it with the assistance of a walker, and uses a wheelchair when they would have to travel a long way as fatigue and pain often cuts short things like trips into town.

Now, the latter is perfectly capable of getting out of the chair and with some assistance folding it away and sitting in a normal bus seat.

Again, a mother with a toddler in a buggy is more capable of doing that than a mother with a baby and all of the garb that goes along with that.

So, if the case is a mother with a toddler in a buggy asking someone with severe disabilities to move then that is obviously absurd. 

Similarly if someone with a minor disability is asking a mother with baby and a nappy bag that is just as crazy.

TL;DR Being disabled is not necessarily more difficult than being a mother and each case should be evaluated by the individuals involved and not a bus company.

Perhaps the best solution is to force buses to put in more fold away seating to make sure everyone is accomodated?",null,0,null,1436491781,null,0,false,0,csy3usw,null,t3_3cp10t,null,t1_csy3usw,null,t3_3cp10t,null,null,null,1437728411,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

We have being going through an extremely tough period with belt tightening required and the need to reflect on priorities. So to get the most out of the education and training budgets the Scottish government has chosen to move away from very short study courses (10 hours or less), leisure courses and courses that lead to no qualifications and to instead focus on courses that lead to qualifications and enhance the students' prospects of employment.

The first article focuses on places (headcount/enrollment). This is misleading; it treats someone taking a very short study course leading to no qualification as equivalent to someone taking a full time course leading to a qualification. The Scottish Funding Council instead uses measures such as Full Time Equivalents, Teaching Hours and Weighted Standard Units of Measurement (WSUM). One full time student is equivalent to 148 students doing very short duration courses in terms of teaching hours. In terms of WSUM's the fall over the period 2005-06 to 2012-13 has been just over 3% - or 0.43% per annum. [Link](http://www.sfc.ac.uk/web/FILES/Statistical_publications_SFCST022014_BaselineReportforAcademicYear201213/Baseline_Report_2012-13.pdf) - page 7.

Given the financial strictures of the last few years IMO what the Scottish government has achieved is praiseworthy rather than a source of criticism - it has managed to retain 97% of teaching capacity, maintained free tuition and ended Labour's Â£2,000 Graduate Endowement Charge

If you want to pick out statistics - The average hours of learning per student have increased by 57% from 2007-08. We could play this game all day.

This is what the Scottish Funding Council has to say:

&gt;A substantial fall in student numbers was expected as SFC moved away from funding very short programmes of study (under 10 hours) and leisure programmes in favour of more substantial courses designed to improve the studentâs employment prospects.
&gt;
&gt;Under both the headcount and enrolment measures a student studying for one hour would be counted the same as a full-time student studying for 600 hours or more.
&gt;
&gt;As SFC pays colleges to deliver a specified number of learning hours a move towards more substantial programmes of study will mean that colleges deliver their learning hour targets whilst recruiting fewer students.
&gt;
&gt;The learning hours and Full-Time Equivalent measures are more comparable measures over time when measuring funded activity and are favoured when comparing high level volumes over time.â

Edit

TL/DR

* Headcount numbers are misleading - One full time student is equivalent to 148 students doing very short duration courses in terms of teaching hours.
* The Scottish Government has moved priorities away from very short (10 hr) courses to courses leading to qualifications.
* The fall in these very short programmes/non-recognised qualifications accounted for around 103,000 of the total reduction of 208,000 enrolments between 2007-08 and 2012-13.
* **The fall in WSUM's from 2005-06 to 2012-13 is 3% or 0.43% per annum.**

They're a great balance between the styles of Classic Who and the modern show. Their pacing is a little slower (which for me is a relief, because I often feel that the modern show is frantically overpaced), but not so slow it feels static, which the classic series sometimes did due to lower budgets and different storytelling norms. The voice work is almost uniformly top-notch. The stories are excellent, and Big Finish frequently makes better use of the classic Doctors' talents than the show did; Six and Eight especially benefit from their efforts. And they'd be even better for those laundry days; no screen to look up and check on when action kicks up, haha. It's more effective than you might expect.

And it's a good time to get into them, because the BBC is slowly doling out more and more modern-series rights to them, which means they have stories in production like a Kate Stewart UNIT boxset, a Diary of River Song set, and a Classic Doctors, New Monsters set (for which I'm most excited). I wouldn't be surprised if we get some new Ten and Eleven stories from them in the next couple of years; David Tennant worked with them in a couple of stories before he was cast as the Doctor and has such love for the show that I can only imagine him being excited if the opportunity arises, and Matt Smith seems like he regrets having left at all, haha.

null,false,kopking08,null,null,null,"Let's just be fucking clear once and for all. No manager is going to please every single player in his squad. That starts, first and foremost, with the fact that certain personalities don't gel with others. You can't get around that. Not getting on isn't proof that you can't both do your jobs or that you don't respect each other.

Every single individual you have mentioned are people who have either been shipped on from Liverpool or wanted to leave. Consider how that will effect their feelings about Rodgers. 

Ultimately, a manager has a huge set of responsibilities when managing a club as massive as Liverpool. You cannot hold the hand of every player. I'd be pissed at him too if I was Agger or Carroll or Downing or whoever. I'd also be a competitive athlete who thinks I can cut it wherever if given a proper chance. That'll be what made me good in the first place, but that doesn't mean I'm actually that good. 

It's very rare you'll find a lad not getting their way who's going to go out of their way to say nice things about the manager. 

That, however, has very little to do with how good a manager Rodgers is. Ultimately, to move forward, you're always going to upset certain people. Some of them you won't want to have, like Agger say. Others like Carroll or Downing or whatever are obviously going to have to moan. But most of us who aren't daft would know they needed to be moved on and weren't going to cut it long term here. 

Rodgers is, by the accounts of most of his players, a great manager. He is, by the accounts of many of the signings, one of the reason's they've come aboard. The last worry I have about Rodgers is how he handles the players. And I certainly don't, for a fucking minute, think he could have done anything different about Raheem. I wish all you who keep saying these fucking stupid things like, ""It sounds like it is about winning"", ""It sounds like it is about a lack of respect from the club"", ""It sounds like Rodgers may be at fault"", would fucking take a step back and look at how completely ridiculous his story is. It's as ridiculous as the Suarez story the summer Arsenal bid for him. It changed every fucking day to suit whatever angle they thought might work. They're just throwing shit to see what sticks.
