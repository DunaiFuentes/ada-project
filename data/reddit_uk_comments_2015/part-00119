&gt;...""However, itâs worth asking if this Derry/Londonderry split is as universal as people claim. Just before the unrest of the 1970s, the 1967 Blue Guide to Ireland was able to refer confidently to âLondonderry, always spoken of as Derryâ (Muirhead 1967:130) while as far back as 1849 Samuel Lewisâs Topographical Dictionary of Ireland noted that âIt was originally and is still popularly called Derryâ¦ The English prefix, Londonâ¦was for a long time retained by the colonists, but hasâ¦fallen into popular disuseâ (Lewis 1849:259). 

&gt;Itâs indicative of the traumatic events of the last thirty years that âLondonderryâ has reasserted itself despite the fact that descendants of the original colony had abandoned the usage by the mid-nineteenth centuryâ which was itself a period of sectarian conflict.

&gt;As a result, âDerryâ and âLondonderryâ have lost all semblance of neutrality. Like disputed parades, these names have become part of Unionist and Republican self-definition and self assertion; theyâre not just symptoms of certain cultural allegiances, theyâre also constitutive of those allegiances.

&gt;There are several ironies in this situation, however, not least the fact that the Loyalist society most associated with Siege commemorations is called the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and that one of Unionismâs most favoured songs is âDerryâs Wallsâ. Even more tellingly, the Anglican diocese in which Derry/Londonderry is situated âretains its ancient name of Derryâ (Lewis 1849:266). 

&gt;These slippages suggest that âDerryâ is not an exclusively Catholic usage and that âLondonderryâ is by no means universal among Protestants. Loyalists who use the term are therefore identifying themselves with the townâs original planters in order to signal that they once again feel besieged. 

&gt;While itâs possible to have sympathy for this position, the revivification of âLondonderryâ as a marker of resistance has none the less created a situation where citizens are forced to participate in a sectarian discourse even if they donât want to. Indeed they are projected-into that discourse simply by naming their place of residence. Short of calling the place âStroke Cityâ (pace âDerry-stroke-London-derryâ) itâs impossible to find a term for it that isnât loaded with historical baggage.",null,0,null,1427745236,null,0,false,0,cpvuxnd,null,t3_30sumu,null,t1_cpvuxnd,null,t1_cpvtmf8,null,null,null,1432102284,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

&gt; Unlike the town, governmentally there was not a preceding administrative area called County Derry. Rather County Londonderry was created by James I when he gave a charter to the Irish Society to undertake the new county's plantation â the London prefix being added in reference to the London Livery Companies of the Irish Society. ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Londonderry)

This is akin to naming an area in Iraq Halliburton-Bagdad or Enron-Helmand, 
 
&gt; There was one area, however, to which no private entrepreneur could be tempted, not only because of the presence of large numbers of resentful natives who expected the Earls to return at any time, but because there were uncertainties over title, as some Irish landholders were languishing in gaol. That area was âOâCahanâs Countryâ which had been âshiredâ and re-named the County of Coleraine in the reign of Elizabeth I, but in practice the âshiringâ meant very little until after 1607. In order to secure the territory, it was decided to âinviteâ (in practice âcoerceâ) the powerful City of London to finance the âplantationâ of County Coleraine, but even that proved to be a problem, and the City of London was eventually commanded to carry out the Plantation itself to the great alarm of the worthy burghers of London, who certainly did not wish to commit effort, money, and lives to distant, barbarous, papist Ulster, where there was no infrastructure worth speaking about, and where things looked decidedly unstable and dangerous.

Whilst in the south the county system forms the basis of local government; no such system exists in the north since 1973; there are very few administrative purposes for counties, It is largely the GAA which adheres to the County System across the whole Island.

&gt; The administrative division of the island along the lines of the traditional 32 counties was also adopted by non-governmental and cultural organisations. In particular the Gaelic Athletic Association continues to organise its activities on the basis of GAA counties that, throughout the island, correspond almost exactly to the 32 traditional counties in use at the time of the foundation of that organisation in 1884^.[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland#In_Northern_Ireland)

I would also suggest that judging by our conversation religion is hardly on a pedestal any more in our society. I'm having to defend even the thought that a few bishops sit in the Lords and read a few prayers! You make it sound like any hint of religion in even a minor legislative chamber is the greatest transgression one could imagine. 

Yes, they get tax breaks (they're charitable, like universities and many other organisations). Yes, there are a handful of them who sit and read prayers in the Lords, occasionally turning up to vote and debate for their position, but I don't see anything wrong with it, nor am do I view it as an affront to the separation of church and state -- which is much more about undue exercise of power in imposing a faith upon the unwilling.

Firstly - I'm sorry, but my ethnic group *didn't* rape 1400 girls (1).

&gt;This motion was introduced by the gay students group. And presumably they'd find it just as offensive if there were straight white men going around affecting certain ways of talking... but they didn't find any. And as a gay group, probably restrict most of their time to dealing with things concerning gay people.

You've still not explained how their actions aren't homophobic, also LGBT doesn't necessrilly mean gay and doesn't necessrilly mean that they all tolerate each other ----&gt; e.g hate for transsexuals.
You've also not replied to how ""Surely if their expression so problematic as to merit censorship, it would have been the black students committee who submitted the proposal, not the LGBT comittee.""


&gt;What reason are you giving to me that I should assume that there are significant numbers of straight folk involved in LGBT student societies making pronouncements on how gay men should conduct themselves?

You'll notice that I never said ""significant amounts"" I said ""what basis have you decided that no straight people were involved in it's making?""

Finally I downvoted you because you're adding nothing to the discussion, namely being a condescending twat who refuses to reply to the answers to the questions they have asked.

It sucks, but we are hardly alone. Although it's a fairly old post (2010) and some of the clubs have since gotten better (due to money *cough*ManCity*cough*): http://z8.invisionfree.com/Soccer_Futbol_Forum/ar/t591.htm

""Aston Villa is another popular English club, the biggest one in England's 2nd city, who have gone a long time without any titles. Curiously their last title of any kind was the 1982 European Cup (where they ebat Bayern Munich in the final.) They qualified for that tournament by being English league champions in the 1980-81 season, their previous league title was all the way back in 1910-11! Their last FA Cup win was in 1957. Oh wait they have had some more recent successes, League Cup victories in 1994 and 1996. Still a pretty meagre total for as large of a club as Aston Villa""

So, she's linking the flag with support of convicted Pakistani rapists.  In the same way I suppose that some activists link the American flag with drone strikes or the Israeli flag with settlers.   Or the UK flag with the Iraqi war.

null,false,Yaverland,english,London,null,"All broadcasters are regulated on content, the BBC is just even more regulated and has its own dedicated regulator (the BBC Trust) on top of OFCOM. All broadcasters must abide by neutrality rules which are enforced by OFCOM (though the BBC has even more stringent rules on top of that which are handled by the Trust).

I thought legislators made political neutrality rules because of the difference in effect print and broadcast media have on their audiences. A written piece encourages mental engagement. Its arguments can be read, reread, considered and challenged by the reader. Even articles that can be read quickly have to express some logic and conclusion - people can read faster than newsreaders or pundits can speak, so an article that distracts for even a couple of minutes will necessarily have to do a bit more than a broadcast piece. But broadcasting encourages passive consumption of messages that are inevitably shorter and blunter and filled with emotive voices. It is thus more capable of manipulating peoples' attitudes. (I swear I am not making this up... but I am struggling to find the committee debates on relevant clauses in bills.)


Also, for a long period of broadcasting history, television and radio were  dependent on public bodies and it would have been inappropriate for them to take sides. For a long time it was just the BBC, and even when ITV appeared as a private partnership funded through private sector advertising money, it was so heavily regulated everyone thought of it as one part of a public duopoly, and then Channel 4 appeared and it was funded through advertising but publicly owned.

Should you wish to waste more of your time coming up with some more circular bullcrap, here is my ""crumbling argument""

&gt;The first downvote wasn't mine, but because you said that, the second one was. Nice insecurity bro.

&gt;someone is being an annoying twat and ask them to stop.

My freedom of speech doesn't end where someone's feels begin.

&gt;This motion was introduced by the gay students group. And presumably they'd find it just as offensive if there were straight white men going around affecting certain ways of talking... but they didn't find any. And as a gay group, probably restrict most of their time to dealing with things concerning gay people.

You've still not explained how their actions aren't homophobic, also LGBT doesn't necessrilly mean gay and doesn't necessrilly mean that they all tolerate each other ----&gt; e.g hate for transsexuals.
You've also not replied to how ""Surely if their expression so problematic as to merit censorship, it would have been the black students committee who submitted the proposal, not the LGBT comittee.""


&gt;What reason are you giving to me that I should assume that there are significant numbers of straight folk involved in LGBT student societies making pronouncements on how gay men should conduct themselves?

You'll notice that I never said ""significant amounts"" I said ""what basis have you decided that no straight people were involved in it's making?""

Finally I downvoted you because you're adding nothing to the discussion, namely being a condescending twat who refuses to reply to the answers to the questions they have asked.

His playstyle is also pretty much just what we need too, he's extremely versatile and creative, I can only imagine the kind of chances he could create for our team alongside Silva, it'd be hard for the opposition to decide just who to close down the most out of those two.

The official name of English Heritage is the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (HBMCE) and it is a non departmental government body. As of Wednesday 1st April, HBMCE will be called Historic England. A charity, with its own independent trustees, has also been set up and this will now take the name English Heritage. 

Historic England (HBMCE) will continue to give advice, grants and information to the public on all aspects of England's historic environment. 

English Heritage (the charity) will take over the management of the hundreds of historic buildings/sites across England. 

English Heritage (the charity) does not own any of the properties, these are still owned by Historic England (HBMCE), a.k.a. the government, a.k.a. publically owned. 

English Heritage (the charity) has received a grant of Â£80 million from the government, and this is part of the plan for English Heritage to become self funding over the next 8 years. 


*Why the change?*

From what I can tell, the gist of it is the self funding part, and less restrictions on what the organisation can do. The self funding part is seen as a good thing because the organisation is less at the mercy of government cuts which can mess with planning. There are also less restrictions on how it can raise funds and what it uses those funds on. I imagine the government sees it as a good thing because after this initial Â£80 million grant it will be spending less. 

Edit: I just thought I would also add that it was English Heritage (or the top level I should say) that pushed for this new model, not central government. When Maria Miller (previous Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport) resigned, this new model was still getting signed off and it was a worry that her replacement Sajid Javid would not give it the go ahead.",null,0,null,1427748724,null,0,1427753665,0,cpvx54y,null,t3_30si2g,null,t1_cpvx54y,null,t3_30si2g,null,null,null,1432103394,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Dear Sir or Madam

With reference to the Bicycle Rack installed in 2014 please note that:

1. We sought permission from your authorised agent, *LettingAgent*, to install the rack.

2. Your agent agreed.

If you have now changed your minds, we regretfully accept that, but will have to insist on reimbursement for the cost of the rack and installation, which, naturally, we would not have incurred were it not for your permission.

If you are going to discuss a contentious name surely it's origin plays a part in the discussion.

&gt; If you've anything bar assumptions to back that up I'd be keen to read it. This isn't meant as a dickheady comment, I'd be genuinely interested in reading it. As I said above I've no doubt there will have been those for whom the name has been an issue as far back as the creation of the walled city, but it'd be interesting to see any actual context to this rather than assumptions.

It isn't an assumption, there was a war; read any book on the plantation of Ulster, it's a testament in itself that the name has never been used by Nationalists and even it fell out of favour with Unionists. 

&gt; There was one area, however, to which no private entrepreneur could be tempted, not only because of the presence of large numbers of resentful natives who expected the Earls to return at any time, but because there were uncertainties over title, as some Irish landholders were languishing in gaol. That area was âOâCahanâs Countryâ which had been âshiredâ and re-named the County of Coleraine in the reign of Elizabeth I, but in practice the âshiringâ meant very little until after 1607. In order to secure the territory, it was decided to âinviteâ (in practice âcoerceâ) the powerful City of London to finance the âplantationâ of County Coleraine, but even that proved to be a problem, and the City of London was eventually commanded to carry out the Plantation itself to the great alarm of the worthy burghers of London, who certainly did not wish to commit effort, money, and lives to distant, barbarous, papist Ulster, where there was no infrastructure worth speaking about, and where things looked decidedly unstable and dangerous.

The alternative they propose(I suspect) is to rely on a short term fantasy of renewable energy suddenly coming online. Fine in the long run but unrealistic as a way to shut down/reduce coal usage in the short term that gas power plants can do.

There's inequality across the board, but the Premier league leads by a good bit.  I'm not saying American sports are SO much better, but it's never a lock that it will be the same 3-4 teams every year (and yes, it is still possible to buy championships, but it's not as common now.) 

I like the idea of still having some ""Davids"" (vs. Goliaths) because it's great to see them lose to small teams from time to time, but when it's so utterly clear that there's no way to win (I mean, look at Tottenham and Southampton - played great but they're still not a real contender), what's the point?

The only thing that would influence ANY decision towards parity would be a loss of interest (and therefore viewers/ratings), but I don't see that happening.  The Premier League seems to be able to bank on the big games like Red Shite vs. Man U, as they're huge global brands (645 million people watched that game).  That pretty much pays for all the other matches combined, it seems.

I've got a bit of an idea on inflation but economics isn't my strong point.

The changes brought in for my academic year mean that we pay interest on top of the base rate of inflation, and the interest starts as soon as the debt's been taken out. [The calculator](http://www.studentfinance.direct.gov.uk/scheme/dgv/pws/repayment-calculator.html) might not be the best but it said the amount I owe is gonna increase until 12 years after I finish, at which point it'll be Â£65k. 

From the site

&gt;You are charged interest at the rate of inflation (RPI - Retail Price Index) + 3% from the moment you receive your first student loan payment. Once you graduate you will then be charged interest at the rate of inflation until you begin employment.

Most basic thing ive gotten so far is the shift from hash to grass which can be seen from an increase in seizures of one and a decrease in the other. Was already aware of this but interesting to see it reflected in data.

Another aspect which would need to be considered to properly answer your question is which model of regulation to put in place. 

Amsterdam is a wonderful place but the backdoor problem combined with our existing paramilitaries wouldnt solve our problems but perhaps provide the drugs gangs with a storefront?


Uruguay is going with a more state sponsored/controlled approach. The main source of weed in their country is paraguay and its dirt cheap. So they want to provide a stronger cheaper alternative from the state or the option to grow your own.

Colorado is probably my favourite. I dont know the exact breakdown but it seems to be a fairly simple method of let the market decide the price with sales tax and regulation on growth distribution and sale. Licenceing in particular is strict to attempt to exclude organised crime.

In conclusion I dont really have the ability to fully answer 
your question rite now but it is something im looking into.

Song, since Christmas has been poor. I also feel like he doesn't really get along to well with the squad. That I could be completely wrong about as I don't go chilling in the dressing room and at the training ground every day. But, from what I've seen he doesn't really love the other players. So because of that, I don't want a toxic personality in our squad, which, for the first time since that magical season under Pardew, seems to be mostly good. 
Diarra was also about to sign for us a month or so back. He just can't sign because either FIFA or UEFA won't let him. He's trained with us though and so the club seem to be keen on him. These are the types of singings the David's and Sam are good at.

&gt; From what I can tell, the gist of it is the self funding part, and less restrictions on what the organisation can do. 

At the moment English Heritage is a non departmental government body, and is funded by grants from the Department for Culture Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) and it's own visitor/advisory operations. Being publicly funded and part of the government, there are restrictions on what the organisation can do and how it can raise and spend money.

The chief executive Simon Thurley says in the bbc video the OP linked:  

&gt; There are all sorts of things that we would have liked to have done that we couldn't do because we were too close into government

So as a charity they will essentially have more freedom in how they operate. I'm sure this can be seen as a good and bad thing.

1. i love kolo, great guy, good competitor, fierce. i would love if he stayed. i think we may let him go, though, if he doesn't reduce his wages more. 

2. enrique is not cheap to keep for what he provides. aside from being a translator and spanish players ambassador, he is as good as gone. 

3. good call on aspas. i hope we sell him for what we got him for. still relatively good age for a striker and has a lot to offer, in my opinion. just not for us. 

4. i disagree with lallana. what i've seen is excellent link up play, hard working and creative, when healthy. we should keep him and build some of the attack around him next year. lovren is young for a cb, would love for him to prove everyone wrong. 

5. i hate to agree with you b/c i too love balo, but he could be gone, you're right.

&gt; you are literally comparing the view of a country's flag based on it's international publically stated foreign policy in the same regard as a country's flag being held as a symbol for a relatively small group of criminals who aren't even in the country the flag belongs to.

But Pakistan *does* represent cultural values which may have been connected to the actions of these rape gangs.  Pakistan has religious + cultural values which I think *are* fair game for criticism.  

For instance - [the Pakistani government enshrines religious discrimination in law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan).  This intolerance of people who are not muslims may well have been a cultural factor in the actions of the rape gangs.

And even if it's not official government policy - it could easily be argued that Pakistan has a culture in which women are routinely oppressed.  Perhaps Hopkins feels that hoisting the Pakistani flag is an endorsement of this oppression and that this cultural value was imported by the Pakistani rape gangs.  

To be sure - I think that Hopkins' wording was crude and OTT.  I can absolutely understand that people would find it offensive.  But, in open free-speech societies, we don't call the police when people make offensive comments.

Yeah, it varies between RPI (a measure of inflation) and RPI + 3%. The value for RPI currently in use is 2.5% but used to be higher. While at uni it's RPI + 3, then it depends on what you earn (earn less -&gt; pay less interest).

However, it's by far the most lenient loan you'll ever get. It's linked to salary and will be completely forgiven after a certain date. Depending on what you earn it could cost you less than you borrow. If it helps you get a job paying a bit more (because you don't need to work as long hours and get a better degree / can spend more time going to conferences) it could very easily be worthwhile.

Hard to judge, but taking the loan is unlikely to be a bad decision :)

* **Tonly Moly Foot Peel** has finished peeling and OMG my feet are soooo soft. I like that it's less work that doing mini pedis every few days to prep for sandal wear. And, honestly, I like the peeling &gt;_&gt;

* bought some **Flexitol Heel Balm**, and ordered some **Innisfree Foot Peeling Spray**. The Flexitol has a lovely tea tree smell, is really thick and doesn't leave a film when I tried it on the back of my hand. Once the spray arrives I'm planing to do one foot with each for a couple of months or so and see how it goes. I was thinking I could keep a photo diary, and write up in the mega thread about them. 

* Been wanting to find some new hand creams that don't leave any greasy feels after application so giving **Cuccio Naturale Ultra Sheer Body Butter in Tuscan Citrus &amp; White Tea, and Lavender &amp; Chamomile** which both smell super yum, but more importantly don't leave any stickiness after being rubbed in. Will have to report back about how long hands feel moisturised after use. Also by the same brand I bought some **Professional Pedicure Hydrating Heel Treatment with Argan and Urea**, and some **Professional Pedicure Hydrating Extended Massage Lotion** which I'm excited to try out. 

So, thinking about the (probably urea) foot cream I used to use when I was younger got me thinking about the other things I used to use on my body that worked well for me. Of late I've been more on a 'buy purely for function' focus. I used to buy a lot of stuff from the Body Shop, and part of me is thinking maybe my self care was more attractive when I used stuff that smelt yummy as well as gave me soft, smooth skin (I get super depressed at times and self care can go out the window for weeks).  Body Shop happens to have a sale on so....

* **The Body Shop [Chocomania Beautifying Oil](http://www.thebodyshop.co.uk/sale/view-all-sale-products/chocomania-beautifying-oil.aspx)** More of a *buying for smells* purchase. I'm looking for new hair oils and figured I'd give this a try because OMG chocolate hair XD

* **[The Body Shop Chocomania](http://www.thebodyshop.co.uk/sale/sale-3-and-under/chocomania-body-butter.aspx), and [Sweet Lemon Body Butters](http://www.thebodyshop.co.uk/sale/view-all-sale-products/sweet-lemon-body-butter.aspx)** part smells, part TBS body butters used to be a staple which my skin enjoyed revisit. 

* trying to explore alternatives to shower gel for cleaning around my vulva and pits, so got a sample of **[Sultana of Soap from Lush](https://www.lush.co.uk/products/sultana-soap)** which seems to be decent so far... But I kinda need to get super sweaty pits to see how well it cleans the smell off. 

* I've discovered **OCM with mineral, and tea-tree oils** twice a day is best for me. And the **[Garnier Ambre Solaire Kids Lotion SPF 50+](http://www.garnier.co.uk/sun-protection/beauty/ambre-solaire/on-the-go-kids/on-the-go-kids-protection-lotion-spf-50--)** has helped a lot with my scaring. I've been forgoing both regularly of late and notice my skin is not as happy. They're now added to my HabitRPG so :D I'm pretty sure that OCM has helped *reduced* how oily my face is. I think putting the SPF cream *or serum, see below) on my face the moment I get out the shower makes a great difference, I kinda always knew this but watching a video about the difference between dry and dehydrated skin confirmed it for me. 

* Started using the same **Tea tree and mineral oil OCM** on my upper back long with a silicone massage glove thingy, so hoping it will clear up some more.

* Done my second upper lip wax with **[Lycon Rosette Hot Wax](http://lycon.com.au/products/rosette-hot-wax-xxx)**. I use the same oil mix as for my OCM to cleanse before and after. No angry skin, nor bumps! This wax is awesome! And the block is huge... gonna take a while to work though :D

For future reference, it's the employee's responsibility to claim holidays and holiday pay. You have no automatic right, for example, to roll statutory holiday pay over to the next leave year.

This ENTIRELY depends on the student, subject, and what they want. I worked 3 part time jobs and lived a very, very nice lifestyle coming out of university with more money than I went in, with a 2:1 in a science subject, a job in finance, and an overall attendance to lectures of under 45% over 3 years.

University can be a lot of different things. It was a means to an end for me and thus I studied in a way to maximise my marks, not to maximise my knowledge, hence my lack of attendance. Knowing what you want to get out of it, and then knowing how to get to  your way to that goal, is a hell of a lot more important than studying for hours every night. I believe this has set me up much better for life, where you will find that it's never about knowing everything perfectly, it's about getting the job done in the most efficient way possible.

(this is not intended to sound boastful, I am just tired of this whole 'you can't have it all as a student'. You can. I did.

I think a lot of people are deceived by Lallana's ""hard work."" Does he press *a lot*? Yeah, he does. Does that mean it's hard work? Not necessarily. He runs at players 50+ feet away at full sprint and by the time he gets there the ball is past him. That to me isn't hard work, it's inefficient. Why would you build the attack out of him? Curious. He plays in a position where there are two players clearly better and offer more than him in Coutinho and Sterling. Lallana for me does not ""link up"" play. I mean he does, but he's too slow at doing it, in that he holds the ball too long to the point he slows down the attack. 

There are a few people I know that have watched Lovren since his Lyon days, and he has not improved whatsoever since then. Last year he was helped by having two boss midfielders in front of him. Much like I was with Carroll when we got him, a lot of fans today are hopelessly praying he comes good. He started off so poor that anything he does now that is objectively mediocre, lots of fans subjectively see as good.

A few points to summaries it;

* They estimate the Conservatives will win overall with 285 seats. Labour will come close second with 279. Neither will be anywhere near the 326 needed for a majority. 

* The SNP will do well, but achieving a more realistic 37 seats (rather than the 54+ some people have suggested). 

* One of the huge stories is that the Lib Dems are facing a wipeout, reducing them to just 26 seats (their lowest number since 1992!)

If true, even Labour and the SNP won't have enough seats to form a majority (either in a coalition or a confidence and supply arrangement). They could only do it by forming a 3 or 4 way arrangement most likely with the Lib Dems. Even if the SNP do win more seats they are likely to be at the expense of Labour anyway... so the supposed Labour-SNP confidence and supply government looks increasingly unlikely.

Essentially if we end up with a Labour-SNP-Lib Dem arrangement it will a much despised government in England - which looks set to vote overwhelmingly Tory. We would be in a situation where essentially the Conservatives ""won"" the national vote, but did not form the government... with a hugely unpopular (even with his own voters) Ed Miliband becoming the prime minister.

However, if you earn more than that you increasingly become worse off relatively speaking.

At a wage of Â£35,000 (which you may hope to be on just three or four years after starting) you pay about ~Â£10,000 more when including interest calculations. You still wont pay the total amount of debt back, and it will take up the 30 years, but it will be thousands more than under the old system.

Of course, just to make sure my maths was right I quickly googled it so I wasn't spreading misinformation and found that according to analysis done by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the new system will make the lowest 25% graduate earners better off leaving the remaining 75% higher earners in a worse position than pre 2012.

The last thing this demographic is looking for is a TV news election story, which is going to be every night for the next month.
 
There is a rapid and ongoing paradigm shift in content consumption. Most 18 year olds do not watch TV in the same way as politicians think they do. Granted they are not the key to winning a majority, just saying that parents are aware that their kids are better or more widely informed than they are.
 
I think we'll see this play out in the US election next year more than in the UK where we are only really arguing about nuances compared to 15-30 years ago. It bothers me that these politicians seem to think that their differences are important. Once upon a time there was a clear difference between left and right in the UK. Blair stopped that yet no politician seems to have noticed. So now they just argue nuances and trivia which help nobody and only make them feel important. Let's see how the US elections deal with that concept next year.
 
Why did I go on this rant? Well I guess because I think the broadcasters are much better at seeing what has happened than the perpetrators, and they understand that politics these days is about opinion and not policy. Their job is to present 'political campaign facts' and suggest that ""you can join the discussion by tweeting xyz"" Broadcasters are at least giving people a platform, no matter what their motives. Politicians do not give them that platform on TV because it would be boring TV. Politics is very boring in the UK - at least in the run up to this election Farage has given the collective media something to get hysterical about, no matter what else, he achieved that.

There's so much talk around and so many stories about gender divides and to be honest I just don't see it. I have worked in IT for 15 years and the people who want to be there all had the same opportunities, there really isn't any boys club that I ever saw and I have worked with a few talented women. I realise that there are far more men in IT than women but I don't feel this is caused by a lack of opportunity or awareness and I think most men in IT would rather there were more women. I for one was sick of sharing 2 urinals with 150 other dudes on the same office floor. The reason there aren't more women in IT is because there aren't as many women interested in it.

&gt;US President [George W.

In Washington, D.C., the US Army band played ""[God Save the Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen)"" (the British national anthem, the melody of which is also used in an American patriotic hymn, ""[My Country, 'Tis of Thee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Country,_%27Tis_of_Thee)""), a suggestion that US Army veteran John Miska made to Vice Chief of Staff General Cody, outside the [British embassy in the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Embassy,_Washington).  On 12 July, a [Detroit Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Symphony_Orchestra) brass ensemble played the British national anthem during the pre-game festivities of the [Major League Baseball All-Star Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) at [Comerica Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comerica_Park) in Detroit.

FSG hired Rodgers because they were hoping to find someone that would bring success and can lead the club for many years to come. He has had three years at the helm now, and only one season has been an actual success. Even then, there is a very strong possibility we won't even get any silverware this season, which would be three full seasons with no silverware. I'm not a fan of the argument that we are just hiring and firing managers. We are not. FSG never hired Hodgson, so that one should not count. As far as Kenny, he was seen more as a guy to steer the ship clear and not as someone long term. Rodgers has had three seasons and nothing to show for it. Of course, if he gets top four this year he'll probably still be in the job next season. A lot of people underestimate FSG. They are not afraid to make bold decisions, especially when someone's been in charge for three years and has nothing to show for it. Furthermore, I doubt that FSG have forgotten the horrific start to this campaign. They were not expecting immediate results, but were definitely expecting progression from one season to the next. Currently, his three year career appears to have peaked last season. FSG are wolves hiding in sheep's clothing.

Lib Dem Nick Clegg should've gone long before now to give his party any hope of avoiding a massacre at the elections. He personally has come out of the coalition looking like a lapdog and someone who can't uphold his promises, and that's going damage the party's chances.

Labour's Ed Miliband has pretty much no profile at all. He just isn't a presence, and hasn't at all capitalised on what's been a rather shaky coalition. I dare say if you showed 100 random people a photo of him, at least half wouldn't know who he was.

Which leaves UKIP's Nigel Farage who, despite being a repulsive individual, has single-handedly dragged a party plagued by racists and bigots kicking and screaming into mainstream discussion through sheer cult of personality.

What I will say, Cameron at least seems to acknowledge he's a toff with a priveleged background- he's never really tried to play the ""I'm one of you"" card all that much ([and it's been hilariously bad when he has](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/29/pasty-row-david-cameron)), and has been unashamed to show his love of more traditionally upper class endeavours.

He has the quality to immediately walk into our first XI, and improve it in doing so even. He is young and has room to improve as a player. He's one of the brightest young talents in Europe and has the potential to be a superstar at both club and international level for years to come.

You said initially that he couldn't fill the centre mid role for us, and you're reiterating it here again. I genuinely could not disagree more.

He scores goals. He's a good passer of the ball, and this is an aspect of his game that could improve further. He's a great dribbler. He's a great athlete. His defensive contributions are underrated and overlooked, he's no shirker.

He's 22 years old. He's bound to be a bit raw and rough around the edges. Everything positionally and mentally will come with age, experience and coaching. Likewise he'll become more efficient with age, and less prone to showboating.

Besides, Pogba does much more than Yaya defensively anyway:

http://www.whoscored.com/Players/97752/Show/Paul-Pogba

Compare his tackling stats to other major centre mids.

He averages more than double Yaya's tackles a game. 2.5 vs 1.1.

Compare him to Vidal, renowned for his defensive contributions. There isn't much in it in tackling averages. Vidal averaging 3 vs Pogba's 2.5, Marchisio averages 2.6

Pogba's weakness appears to be interceptions, but this can be worked on. It can be improved.

Still higher than Yaya's at 0.8 vs 0.5 a game this season.

He is not a purely attacking midfielder. That is simply not true. He is a bonafide centre mid.

null,false,ahhyes,null,null,null,"Open any accounts you think you might need in the UK before you leave. It's easy to do here but once you're overseas it becomes a lot harder/impossible. It seems that UK companies can't be bothered with all the money laundering things for non UK residents that they just outright say no. Especially any trading accounts - although they might make you close them if you tell them you've left the UK.

I think you can open a US account before you arrive in the US. They might say you need to tell them your social security number but you don't - same applies when you try and open one once you get into the US.  

Transfer your mobile to Three. They offer free roaming in the US. It's meant to be just for holidays but they don't check...or just say you're coming home next week if they do! Do this now as I think they make you wait 90 days before you can activate international roaming. 12 month sim only is a bargain. Makes it nice for calling home or having people call you. Most useful for calling banks and other places once in the US.

You can use a R105 form with your accounts to have no interest taken off once you're a non-resident. Some banks don't accept it and will suggest you take one of their expat accounts (with lower interest) so you could do a R85 before you leave...

Get a zero fee international credit card, think Halifax and post office do them. Useful for buying things in the US but paying for it in pounds.

If you have an ISA you're not allowed to contribute towards it during the entire tax year when you leave. So either pay everything in now before this tax year ends and don't put anything into one next year...OR never get round to telling the bank your new address and just forward your mail...You can keep your accounts open but can't add. The can't add applies retrospectively for the whole tax year. Also it'll be impossible to open new ISAs once you leave, so make sure you have a good rate before you go.

For transferring money, I've used Worldfirst.com. They offer good rates vs. banks and no fees if you transfer a large amount (10k I think).

If you're company offers you help, use it. If your company has a Credit Union in the US associated with it, use it. Probably can help getting credit if you need - car loan/credit card etc.

Tax is a whole other issue. Hopefully your company helps in some way. Sign up for HMRC self assessment if you're going to be renting out your home in the UK. You have to get codes in the post and it takes ages.

Will you be getting paid in US or still in UK? Keep bank accounts their currencies the same. i.e. don't have a UK salary paid into a US account.

US banking system seems to be about 15 years behind the UK. Checks [sic], no direct debit scheme, no chip and PIN, no faster pay, shared PIN on cards...No (virtually) consumer protection...US credit cards offer protection and insurance and things so when you do get one see what has the best stuff for what you need. Don't sign up for auto pay for bills. It's safer/better to review your bill each time then pay, you'll be able to pay online but just don't give them permission to take whatever they want from your account whenever.

null,false,myheroinepretend,null,null,null,"**Name of product:** sr-skincare's Active Solutions 5% Salicylic Peel toner

**Price of product:** Â£5.50

**Where did you purchase:** [sr-skincare website](http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/5-salicylic-acid-181-p.asp)

**Product claims:** Ideal for oily, combination, and acne prone skin

Main benefits:

* Exfoliates dead skin cells from the surface leaving the skin softer, smoother, and brighter.

* Controls excess oil production

* Decongests the pores reducing the possibility of spots

* Removes blackheads

* Encourages skin cell turnover and boosts collagen production

* Effective bactericide - will kill acne causing bacteria

**About you:** Extremely dry, acne prone skin. Extremely susceptible to closed comedones.

**Your opinion:** This is my holy grail BHA product and I am never looking back. Took a chance on this one because of the low price and the positive feedback that this sub has given on some of their AHA peels. I was previously using a Paula's Choice BHA but wasn't blown away, especially considering the price. Within a couple of days of using this product, my daily breakouts had cleared up - no exaggeration. I nearly cried with happiness. I was quite worried about it drying out my already dry skin but haven't experienced that at all. 

The only downsides I can come up with are the very strong astringent smell and the slight burning on application. After my first application I was very upset, thinking I would never be able to use it again as it caused my skin to redden. The next day I was so amazed at the results that I didn't give a damn about any amount of burning. My bumpy skin was smoother and my spots had all but vanished. It's also a little fiddly - I use a fan brush to apply that I received with one of the peels ordered from the same website. I imagine using the cotton wool pads provided might waste some of the product. 

I honestly can't rave about this enough. I'll try dredging up a B&amp;A picture if I'm feeling brave.

At 4% interest, over 25 years, you would be paying over Â£1,400 per month. At 6% this would rise to Â£1,750, and at 8% it would be Â£2,100.

There are interesting points about the complexities of the issue and the need for a distinction between different groups within the muslim community in the UK.

The majority of muslims integrate well into british society, especially the younger ones. That said there is still a sizable minority which do not integrate well and stick to their own cultural enclaves. I think we have to take a very hard line on extremist preachers and encourage muslims themselves to get involved in reporting these people to the police. Religious schools are also a huge source of problems, especially at a young age we need to expose kids to as many different people as possible (on both sides muslim and non-muslim) to encourage tolerance.

When we do encounter specific problems within the community we need not to demonise them like the media love but work together with those communities and their leaders to fix them in the long term. These people aren't going anywhere and as a consequence we need long term solutions not to constantly tell them that they are never going to fit in which will only alienate them further.

Depending on the university, there can be a lot of leeway. The top universities will not allow any leeway, most prospective students will be achieving well over the offer set. A friend of mine got CCC in A Levels and his university offering BBB accepted him, but it's not a particularly prestigious university. Lancaster is a pretty damn good university, so I'm not sure, probably depends on your course, they won't give much for medicine but for less competitive courses they might be lenient. It's entirely up to them, but I'd advise contacting them, worst case scenario is that they don't offer any leeway, you find out sooner rather than later and can make plans. It's a scary prospect but it won't change anything, they won't withdraw your current offer or change it, all that will happen is that you are equipped with more information. They won't mark your application or anything like that.

Fewer than half of convicted prisoners re-offend and there is some very weak evidence that of them, those who serve longer sentences reoffend slightly less often but there are many, many confounding variables to work.

On top of the mortgage costs don't underestimate how much money a house costs to maintain. Even a small house can drain your money away very quickly and you can go from 'throwing money away' on rent to 'throwing money away' on stuff like blocked drains, emergency plumbing repairs and redecorating.

We are certainly trying to replicate the same strategy and currently have 16 players out of loan. Some of these 16 were touted as potential world beaters not too long ago. We also paid an amount similar to this wonderkid's valuation to some of our players currently out of loan like Luis Alberto, Origi, Coates, Illori. 

But our plan seems to be buying players around 20 years of age, who are either already on the cusp of first team football or are already playing at that level. Last time we purchased a teenager that I can think of was Yesil. So this could happen with this wonderkid, but it is nothing to get excited about because the chances of a kid making it at the top is really slim. So our best odds are at stacking our academy and loan books with a lot of these players, like Chelsea. With hopes that at least 1 in 10 will turn out to be a star and in-turn pay for the strategy.

One very important aspect of this strategy is also to loan at a higher level club as possible.

A brief timeline of the cockups...

The Community Reinvestment Act passed under Carter forced financial institutions to significantly lower lending standard. 

Then when Clinton repealed Glass-Steagall, financial institutions were able to merge into behemoth entities that by definition promoted institutionalised conflict of interest. 

We then had the concept of default correlation, and how it was applied by institutions like Fannie Mae, and later megabanks to repackage the debt into saleable financial securities.

These three events made it possible for banks to issue speculative debt on a mass scale to people who couldn't afford it, then chop up dodgy debt and mix it in with good debt, to package risk. 

The final nail in the coffin was Labour butchery of financial regulation in the UK. Stripping the BoE of its historic responsibility and creating the FSA, who would work alongside the BoE and the Treasury was a recipe for confusion and contradiction.

As a consequence, London because an US offshore hub for financial alchemy. The CDS market which was tightly regulated in the US, shifted to London and  emerged into a tradable insurance market for too big to fail institutions. Sounds normal except for the fact that you can issue or by CDS on anything you like (within reason), regardless of your relationship with it. 

Evidently, it was a recipe for disaster.

When the US Govt bailed out AIG to the tune of $180bln (and by proxy, the global investment bank community), it was due to contracts designed, created and issued in London.

So, while Labour didn't cause the global financial crisis, they did directly create the petri dish that allowed it to turn from a localised disaster into a global epedemic.

Its too early, and there are too many vested interests in politics and the media now to have full clarity for the public eye, but history is going to be even more brutal on the like of Brown and his two Ed'd monster.

Hate the Tories all you like, fine, but bloody hell, keep these degenerate Ed's out of power at all cost.

We need to relentlessly criticize Islam, like any set of bad ideas, and we should support those muslims and ex-muslims who are trying to reform their culture/religion.  In short, we need to encourage a reformation.  It's not enough to support the moderates.  We also have to support the apostates, reformers and heretics.  

We also have to maintain free-speech in western nations so that critics both internal and external to Islam can effectively criticize this religion, and to know that they have the full protection of the state when they do so.

Another good step would be to publish more and more cartoons of Mohammed, or encourage other acts of blasphemy.   Why?  Because it sends the message that we *won't* cower to threats of violence and that *all* ideas are ripe for ridicule.

Well, yes, it will make many muslims angry.  Unfortunately, there's no polite way to criticize absurd ideas when the people who hold those ideas have devoted their lives to them.

If more cartoons of mohammed are published, will it create more violence?  Probably, yes.  But it is well within our power to withstand this violence.

We don't!  There are already reformers within Islam, or who have left the religion.  They routinely risk their lives to speak out and the only thing required from us is our support.

No. They are arguing about the philosophy and ideals of forgetting the past, without having any idea of what bodies and structures we have in place to deal with the past.

My own view is the past is still very raw in Northern Ireland, and alot of bitterness and sense of injustice and lack of recognition persists - which runs the risk of being inherited by a less knowing second and third generation (and isn't so much of Irish history a long cascade of passed on and never-ending grudges? Maybe we should try and grow out of it). The point is made in the podcast.

There's also a sense, not unjustifiable, that some victims have been rewarded with more truth than others (e.g. Bloody Sunday over, says Kingsmills, La Mon or indeed Ballymurphy).

My own preference would be for an amnesty process linked to a very comprehensive and open 'truth process'. e.g. maybe the amnesty process only takes effect if you come forward with your story (the McConville case shows how powerful the IRA law of omerta remains). Otherwise, you're still open to investigation. 

It would need to be fully signed up to by the paramilitaries though - otherwise it could just become another state bashing exercise that exacerbates the existing problem.

They're worse than a bunch of primary school kids sometimes.

That's more to do with the separate nature of their presidential system. Here, the ruling party is determined by the legislature, so the government is roughly in line with the elected representatives. We don't elect a separate government administration to the people who vote on legislation. 

Having a stronger upper house would certainly present problems but those would mostly be determined by the smaller details. How are they to be elected differently from MPs in the Commons, how long do they serve terms for, etc.

As a niche party largely ignored by the media, they could get away with saying whatever crazy things they wanted with no accountability from the public beyond their most dedicated supporters.

There are plenty of things about the greens that I do like and others that just seem unworkable and I'm hoping that those aspects get improved as they become more involved in mainstream politics.

Another positive reason for supporting them is that no matter what they do in the end, labour will move leftwards and pick up policies that are important to green voters in order to win back votes.

**Skin concerns** Get spots around the sides of my face, chin area and the occasional one on my forehead. Have lots of whiteheads on my chin, and tonnes of blackheads on my nose, forehead and the areas right next my nose right under my dark circles.

Okay my question is about how much product is maybe too much product. I posted here yesterday for Merry Mondays generally pleased wit how I've managed to keep up my routine and particularly yesterday and today my skin is starting to look less red, and blackheads are most definitely decreasing. I credit **Neutrogena's Spot Stress Control 3in1 Cleansing Lotion** (my BHA) for doing this, after cleansing with **Boots Simply Sensitive Foaming Cleansing Wash** I've noticed my skin feels a tiny bit dry (I wouldn't say drastically so), but after using the lotion my skin feels smoother. My forehead and nose look shiny after using the lotion, is this normal? I thought it looked shiny because it exfoliates away dead skin (or so I think) but my little sister commented on how shiny my head looked. I'd just like to know other people's experience with this product? I completely soak a cotton ball in this stuff, how much is too much to use? I follow half an hour later with **Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturising Cream** but my sister watched me put it on and said I was using too much (I thought I was barely using any) and that I don't need to put moisturiser all over my face, only in the areas that need it. So yeah if anyone else uses these products how much do you use and does anyone have similar experiences after using the products? I'd be reluctant to stop using the lotion because it's helping with my blackheads so well but if a nice shiny nose and forehead isn't what I should be expecting after use then alternative products would be welcome.

Plus those aren't the central tenets. The tenets are:

 * Faith or belief in the Oneness of God and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad;
 * Establishment of the daily prayers;
 * Concern for and almsgiving to the needy;
 * Self-purification through fasting; and.
 * The pilgrimage to Makkah for those who are able.

Aside from the last, these aren't inherently  different from Christian values:

 * ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me""
 * Go to church once a week
 * "" Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.""
 * Lent

So unless visiting Makkah is incompatible with British values, I'm not sure why Islam should be.

Away tickets are based on loyalty points, and I have an understanding that if ""big"" games come up early in the season they may take into account last seasons loyalty points in allocating tickets, given the restricted numbers.

If you are thinking of trying to buy a ""home"" tickets for another club to see a Chelsea away match, remember that they will be sold in similar fashion to our own - season tickets and memberships. Although all clubs will occasionally have tickets go on general sale, I do know that some restrict purchases from non-members to local addresses for the express purpose of avoiding selling home tickets to rival fans. If by some slim chance you managed to get one, I would not recommend in any way wearing club colours or showing who you support - you will be ejected from the ground by stewards at the very least.

My recommendation would be to buy a membership/register for interest at the earliest opportunity. There was a 5 loyalty point bonus this season for early take up. Once fixtures are released you will have a better idea of the landscape for getting a ticket, but be aware that even after the fixture list is released, it is not ""set"" until the TV games are allocated - plenty of changes will occur.

Also, let's not pretend this is a one-sided issue here. Yes, there is obviously the possibility that some kids will think porn behaviour is normal, and that's something to be addressed in sex ed classes as well, kids need to know porn is scripted, but while we're discussing misleading portrayals of reality in the media (and porn is just a form of media), let's discuss *the entire rest of the media* and how depictions of both men and women are divorced from reality.

Christianity: Founded by a pacifist hippie preaching forgiveness and died at the hands of the Romans without fighting against his charges. Subsequent Christians were persecuted and died at the hands of the Roman government, but it continued to grow throughout the empire through word of mouth and mostly peaceful means. Only after the religion became Established as the religion of the empire, did it ever be associated with bloodsheed as it was attached to a political ideology. 


Islam: Founded by a desert nomad who became a bloodthirsty warlord, destroying the idols of other religious traditions and ensuring that his religion would be spread viciously after his death. Islam subsequently became a political caliphate under Abu Bakr and the other Rashidun's who stopped at nothing to invade others lands to spread their religion. 

When the very origin of the religion revolves around the glory of conquering others and revering the prophet who was considered a righteous warlord, there is a stark contrast between the two.

null,false,WolfyCat,null,null,null,"I played GTA and other 18 rated games when I was 9 or 10 years old. Nothing wrong with me. In fact, graduated with an honours in game design last year. My early experiences with video games definitely helped craft me into the type of person to follow that industry. 13 year olds can play GTA if they want. It would be the parents responsibility to ensure the childs distinction between video games and reality are solid. Its also the parents responsibility to make sure the child is given the attention they deserve to ensure they aren't exhibiting any signs of violent behaviour or other anti-social behaviour which would be exacerbated with video games and other violent or adult media not meant for them. If the parents can't do that, then yes, maybe the kids shouldn't be playing GTA and the like.

I'm sure there are millions of children who were in the same situation as myself who played GTA and other 18+ video games as kids and turned out fine. I have friends who did and we're still very good, law abiding, mentally stable and contributing members of society. Ultimately the responsibility falls on the parents to monitor their children, just like we all had.

The same arguments could be made about violent/mysoginistic films, TV shows, music, books, websites etc which doesnt seem to get the same scrutiny as video games.

Not to mention that some games with 18 ratings probably shouldn't even have an 18 rating cos they're not even that violent or distasteful. Like CoD as an example. The multiplayer is very tame and could be played by anyone 12 and up in my opinion. Ignoring the voice chat of course. Either way, teachers should not have this kind of power. The responsibility falls to the parents or the guardians 

The best part of this stupid new legislation is that it's not even illegal to play 18 games underage. Its only illegal for someone under that age to buy it from a store. So a teacher having the authority to call an officer over to a students house who plays an 18 game is going to be really pointless because there's nothing much he'll be able to do unless the law makes it illegal for children to play games with ratings above their age...

My categories come from me reading ingredient lists and being familiar with what each ingredient does. I spend a lot of time researching, either by typing the ingredients in Google one by one, or checking sites like CosDNA.com to see the function of each ingredient. Packaging lies. They lie and they use buzzwords. They don't highlight the true function of the product, probably because they don't think we're savvy enough to care. What you can trust is the ingredient list. 

##1. Different types of moisturisers.

[There are different types of 'moisturisers'](http://www.skintherapyletter.com/2001/6.13/2.html), and it is important to know why kind do what. 

* **Occlusives**- These physically block water from leaving the skin. This is why a lot of people in SCA were #sluglifing it and covering their skin in vaseline. Common ingredients are: Petroleum, zinc oxide &amp; mineral oil

* **Humectants**- They draw water from lower levels of the skin and the air. Common ingredients are: Glycerin &amp; hyaluronic acid.

* **Emollients** - They smooth the skin by filling in the gaps, they're more likely to immediately improve skin appearance and feel. Common ingredients are: Fatty Acids.

---

The Hada Labo Lotions are called lotions in Japan, but they're better understood to us as serums. They're heavy in glycerin and hyaluronic acid. As hyaluronic acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, it is some serious stuff. It's also naturally found in the body so it's less likely (obviously YMMV) to cause irritation. 

It's better applied on a slightly damp face, and then followed by another type of moisturiser to 'lock in' the moisture. I forgot to add it to the list, but for that step I usually use **COSRX Galactomyces Alcohol-Free Toner**. I have oily skin, so I don't use occlusives as I personally find them too heavy for my skin. My moisturisers are heavy in emollients. 


###2. BHA vs Treatments

Ahh the A-Sol, I tried using it as a sole BHA, but it isn't strong enough. The A-Sol is the perfect example of never trusting the packaging, but instead reading the ingredient list! If you want to see pretty pictures of the packaging and my experience on it in detail, have a read of my review [here](http://adoredee.com/2015/03/05/review-cosrx-natural-bha-skin-returning-a-sol/).

Basically the A-Sol is a propolis product, with a super weak BHA version (Betaine Salicylate) at a low percent (1%). Due to Korea's strict regulation of Salicylic Acid, it is hard to get any product with the ingredient that is is over 0.5% OTC. The A-Sol simply isn't enough for my skin as an exfoliant, but my skin likes it well enough, so I just use it as kind of 'booster'. 

The Neutrogena BHA is slightly drying, but I never use it on it's own. I use it as a BHA and then layer a whole bunch of stuff on top of it, so the dryness never lasts too long.

I consider the Superdrug serum to be a treatment not a moisturiser because ceramides are not a type of moisturiser. They are a found in the body ingredient that work to help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier. I use this just before my hada labo lotion, I personally haven't found it hydrating enough to use as a stand alone, but it also contains some emollients so I guess it could be.

The body which eventually morphed into the FSA was started in 1987 but was limited to a one man body with legal authority to delegate ad hoc regulatory duties. 

In 1997, it was converted into the FSA, and given full regulatory duties in 2001. 

New Labour believed that they had redefined economics and defeated the boom bust cycle, leading to a poisonous fragmentation between monetary policy, fiscal policy and financial regulation.

Due to the lack of cohesion between the three supervisory arms of the UKs finances, loop holes in oversight developed into nefarious practices and sub industries. 

At the time of action, Labour had a overwhelming majority, and so in real terms, the Tories were and still are irrelevant to this debate. I've searched and can't find the voting behind the act, but if you do so please share. I imagine the Tories did support it. A resurgent Tory party then lead the charge to scrap the FSA too, and hand power back to the BoE. 

The problem here is that this is turning into a tit for tat scrap. The Tories are not the guardian angels, nor our saviours. They may have, as a bruised minority, supported these motions. 

It doesn't change the fact that along with Morbid Brown, the two Ed'd Monster was at the centre of decision making, playing a key and inadverted role in the greatest financial disaster in living memory.

There are plenty of studies that show video games as being beneficial to development.

To name only 5.

There are people who ideologically hate the *concept* of computer games. They say kids should be 'outside playing'. We do have that: those are the hood rats hanging about on street corners. These are the people who want kids to have ***their*** upbringing. They think kids should play with wooden cars and a hoop and stick. Following their arguments is like saying 'I don't use a lighter: when I was a wee lad we bashed two flints together. Lighters is making people lazy!'.

The negative effects of computer games appear to come from two issues:

* The content of the game itself
* The amount of time playing the game

Children who play more violent video games are more likely to have increased aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and decreased prosocial helping, according to studies (see Anderson &amp; Bushman, 2001; Anderson &amp; Dill, 2000; Gentile, Lynch &amp; Walsh, 2004). This isn't clear cut however: A study at Boston suggests that experiencing violence in a virtual environment reduces it in the real world, however this could be more predicated on how the game handles violence. If it lets you experience the consequences of your actions it may increase empathy (http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2014/06/037.html). If it just lets you kill every mo'fo in the area with no repercussions then I can see how this would lead to a twisted approach to problems, particularly in a young developing mind. For evidence of this, try and play COD online. You are surrounded by 11 year olds who think insulting everyone around them is a good thing. 

The Telegraph article above links to an Oxford University study that kids who play games for an hour a day actually have boosted concentration, attention spans, reflexes etc. Those playing between 1 and 3 hours have no effect, and negative effects only started from 3 hours onwards. This is partially supported by a paper in the Journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture (http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/ppm-1-1-62.pdf).

Porn is a form of media like every other one. Kids just need to be educated about it. Watching porn isn't a problem, thinking that watching porn is normal isn't a problem (in fact it's correct), having access to porn isn't a problem.

Saying porn makes people sexual deviants is like saying violent films and games make people murderers. You're only correct in the tiny, tiny minority of cases.

The law are a set of guidelines for the classification of fruit when selling them wholesale; so when someone buys a large quantity of bananas they can specify that they want a particular grade of banana. It was a classification system that was based upon a pre-existing British one.

The way FPTP and the party system distorts representation, you get something 25% of the people actually want being pushed through. And the Lords can't stop anything from happening; the Parliament Acts that made them roadblocks instead of being able to fully strike down legislation means that populist ideas go through. Our current system didn't prevent the Iraq War for example.

With more minority opinions represented, I think there would be a lot more parties willing to defy populist ideas. Extreme populism; for example tightening security powers after a terror attack, or banning whatever is the focus of the latest moral panic, are going to happen in any democratic system if the people want it enough. It's almost impossible to prevent it without disallowing the possibility for just populist movements like women's suffrage, or the abolition of slavery or future decriminalisation of drugs.

I'm just pontificating here but her story seems thoroughly harrowing. It seems like she saw the downfall of her son at the hands of a mental illness even at this stage hasn't been properly diagnosed. She must feel at least partially responsible, even if the cause is likely mostly in his brain chemistry. Her life sounds like a horror story. What greater fear do we have than those we love the most turning against us, the fear that we aren't doing a good enough job looking after those we are responsible for, and that there is something intrinsically broken about our child?

It's easy to disregard what the son feels as well, especially as he seems like a fairly normal bloke for the most part. He seems to fear that he was fully responsible and is just a monster, the doctor seemed pretty certain that he wasn't in control of his actions at the time.

Since I'm new to London, I feel this is the most important thing I need to think about before I consider buying a property there.

About the numbers not adding up. 

As /u/q_pop and you have already mentioned - the numbers don't add up. However I have a colleague who works at the same company as me, who went through the same situation as me when he was hired 2 years prior to me in the same role (same salary and promotion progression etc). He bought a house whilst he was still on the first year salary of Â£26,500 with help from his parents. He said that by using his parents house and having his dad on the mortgage as the second name (or first name?) it allowed him to afford a bigger mortgage. I asked him a few questions around this, but didn't pry too deeply as I haven't known him that long. There's every chance his parents may be very wealthy (and I have a feeling they are) which might be why he was able to buy the property. But then again, surely a house as collateral and another name on the mortgage with Â£50k+ salary might help?

His own body? 

&gt;He abused and insulted the religious elders of the time, as well as foreigners. He caused chaos in the temple and had to be killed to ensure that the region remained politically stable.

While it's possible he could have been more xenophobic than the gospels detail, you have to remember that Paul's slant on Christianity is designed to make it palatable to Roman citizens. He often treats foreigners with dignity (Samaritan woman, Centurion's servant) and advocates paying taxes to a foreign ruler (admittedly to make a point). 

He was killed by the Romans because the Jewish leaders threatened to rebel. You can't twist the blame on Jesus to say that what he did deserved execution.

&gt;Now I'm a Christian, and I can tell you that the picture I've just presented is horrifically one-sided, ignores provisos and context, and is often denomination-dependant. But I can assure you that it is exactly as accurate as your description of Christianity as something a ""pacifist hippie"" created.

Ehh... Brother I understand why you tried to present things in this way. But what you said isn't just a biased or one-sided argument, it's absolutely inaccurate. To say that Jesus was a pacifist is accurate: he described himself as ""coming not to bring peace, but a sword!"" Yet his response to violence was to heal the victim and order his disciple to stop defending him.

To say that he was a hippie? Perhaps so, perhaps not. John the Baptist certainly dressed in an unusual manner and probably didn't smell too great.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I'm sorry you see it as an attack - that's not how I see it. I don't think this is even about character (or intelligence, or personal qualities in general) - I think it's about knowledge and perspective and a society (media, and other people's behaviour) which is giving people all sorts of unhelpful cues when it comes to financial stuff.

To me, borrowing money to even partially finance a car is an alarming prospect - it might be the right decision in some occasional circumstances but it would need some serious consideration. This, of course, isn't the general view, given the large number of people who use finance to buy cars when they could get away without doing that. I'm sure that many or most people would look at your idea of taking out an affordable* loan to cover a modest car and think it pretty reasonable.

It would be tempting to think that the majority view is correct and I'm the crackpot - but most people's financial health seems pretty terrible. Even people with good incomes pay thousands in (non-mortgage) interest, have poor retirement savings, and find themselves working into old age. I work in an office with professionals who generally earn rather more rather the average, and when there was a salary payment issue that could have caused pay to be a day or two late, a number of people were genuinely worried about being able to pay their rent!

Furthermore, I worry, in general, about people in their twenties or younger today. No only do you face incredibly high house prices (which are a significant disadvantage even if you inherit a house, unless you inherit while young), but you also face the general trend of power moving from labour to capital (which may not continue, but there seem to be some deep structural reasons for it). The latter being a good reason, IMO, to accumulate some capital.

No we don't. Don't talk utter piss. Nobody is defending a right for children to access whatever porn they like as an educational tool.

Neither has access to porn got anything to do with children being groomed by older men. Again you are talking absolute bollocks.

Kids of 12-13 are sexualised, that's not a bad thing, that's life. It's the time when their bodies are developing and the vast majority of 12-13 year olds will have some interest in sex.

&gt;I think at some point we have to decide if children are, or are not, mature enough for porn

Think we already decided that. Most sane people would agree that children shouldn't be accessing porn.

(Although I guess you could argue that technically you're right - the Jews just didn't realise it at the time!  :P)  Actually, he didn't so much threaten to destroy it as more calmly state that it would be destroyed (although he was accused of doing more by the religious leaders at the time).  That said, the fig leaf example made at the same time in most gospels makes it fairly clear what the implication is - ""leafy"" faith will be thrown aside for ""fruitful"" faith, by force if necessary.

Jesus calls the Canaanite woman a dog - albeit then immediately heals her daughter.  He consistently takes on the Pharisees in verbal battles, but still ends up eating with them - it's a religious elder who actually gives Jesus his own tomb.  He claims to be above all earthly authority, yet tells people to serve those who lead them while they still can.

The atmosphere at the time was certainly complex - the attempted revolution by the Zealots shows that - but the authorities did seem to fear Jesus, what with his statements about bringing down the Temple, and his ability to amass relatively large crowds.  I'd argue that one of the reasons the religious leaders feared him was his rebellion, although the Romans probably feared that less.

What I've said is definitely absolute inaccurate, but not because any individual part is *wrong* per se, but more because I've ignored any sort of wider context and attempted to fit Jesus into a very narrow category, selected the bits that match that, and misunderstood all the bits that don't.  This is exactly what happens when people describe Jesus as a pacifist hippie.  He accepts the existence of violence and persecution, he doesn't ever claim that the world can live in peace and harmony until the new heaven and earth come.  He also wasn't a dreamer that spoke of a nicer way and a nicer time.  He was at once a scholar, a labourer, and God.  He knew absolutely the scriptural necessity for salvation through his death on the cross, and he knew absolutely (at least according to the Bible) that he was the saviour that was sent.  That's not some silly hippie ""far out man"" day-dream, it's a cold hard reality that at points made him cry out to God in desperate hope for another way to save humanity.  To call Jesus a ""pacifist hippie"" is just simply wrong.",null,0,null,1427800224,null,0,false,0,cpwjcth,null,t3_30vndr,null,t1_cpwjcth,null,t1_cpwiyql,null,null,null,1432114002,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

But (almost) every meat eater I know says something like, ""Eating meat is ethical iff the animal doesn't suffer *too much*"" (usually in the form of, ""If the animal suffers less than I enjoy eating it"" or ""If the animal has a pleasant enough life that it wouldn't regret being born, assuming animals feel emotions like regret"").

They then go on to say, ""Since I believe eating meat is ethical, it is wrong for you to proslyte about vegetarianism - I am not doing anything unethical""

So then I ask, ""Ok, where was the last animal you ate slaughtered?"" and nobody I have ever asked can tell me. If they can't tell me that, how can they possibly have an informed opinion as to whether the animal suffered too much for it to be ethical to eat? And if they can't tell me that, how can they possibly claim they are 'ethical' meat-eaters?

So sure, I (sort of) buy the argument that there is some level of animal suffering below which I would probably switch back to eating meat (I'd probably eat oysters, for example, because they don't really 'suffer' in a meaningful way, although I can't really afford oysters routinely and prefer the taste of other things anyway). But I don't buy the argument that just because it is *possible* to eat meat ethically (maybe), that that means that *you* eat meat ethically. If you are failing at living up to your own moral framework then I think I am entirely entitled to point that out, even if some people find it 'smug' or 'arrogant', because the welfare of animals is important to me.

null,false,petethepool,null,null,null,"Logic is not holding a grudge with a Spanish man who stuck around while the club's best players were year-on-year sold, to be replaced by people whose names I don't want to even try to remember. It's not blaming a player from Madrid after the manager who brought him to the club was sacked an replaced by an owl. When the club promised so many different things (of which I know so little but can well imagine.  Spades in the ground lads!) but delivered nothing. 

Logic is what Torres was using when he left for Chelsea. Liverpool made him into a Â£50m player and that's what he gave to the club in return. 
Torres' logic broke my heart and it left a sour taste - yes. But look at the life the man has led since. On one hand he's won trophy on trophy and made a butt-load of money, but on the other he's been largely ineffectual or at best bit-part in all of those winnings. More importantly, and on the far side of logic: He has never been loved like he was at Liverpool (although the notion that the Chelsea fans weren't incredibly patient with him is wrong - they were), and he has never been a more significant, feared player than the years he was at the club. 
The point is if the man was happy with his decision - if he was happy for the hollow trophy's and money, do you think he'd give a fuck about a charity game at Anfield? Do you think Gerrard would want him there if Torres had really fucked the club over as spectacularly as it has been suggested? 

The man made a difficult decision, and he was thinking about his 'career' - as a lot of people logically do. But it's clear from his own statement: 'Today I feel in peace with myself.' His career move has haunted him for 4 years. It's haunted me too for 4 years - long-lost love, and all that. 

The reason all the love is coming back is because here you have a man who made a harsh and selfish decision (but understandable, considering the state of the club and his age relative to the length of his career) to leave a club he genuinely loved. Unlike, say, Suarez ('true professional'? Who bites people to engineer a move from one club to another? - don't be ridiculous), who, although he is obviously a fan, treated Liverpool, from start to finish, as a stepping stone to bigger things - he never intended to stick around. Torres was different. For Suarez, the club bent over backwards to keep him - and the season he left Liverpool finished second. The season before Torres left, how many fans were protesting Hicks and Gillet? Hodgson Out anyone? Torres had had enough - like we all had. Kenny was turning it around - but fans have their entire lives to be patient. Professional players not so long. But what you had, with Torres returning for this match, was just that - a fan, a man who loved the club, given a chance to come back and play again, to show his regret for how things went down (I think we would all hear a lot more from him, if he wasn't trying to be respectful to Chelsea too - which he should be, as ultimately they wasted a lot of money on him), and to show how fondly he remembers the god-damn place. As fans, I am so, so proud that he was recognised for the services he gave, rather than for how he left. It made me proud, once more, to be a Liverpool supporter.  It was an unbelievable moment where collective forgiveness actually took place on the pitch, and the man was visibly shaken, and unburdened of a lot of guilt as a result. Torres would never have had that reaction, or received that reaction from the fans, if it wasn't so painfully obvious that he loved the club. What else can you ask of the man? Why not forgive him? What's to gain from holding on to so much bitterness? Not only is he at peace with himself now; I'm at peace with the whole abandoning thing for the first time too.

As a constituent of England, I appreciate any politician who can approach a problem like Paedos + Race = Rochdale pragmatically and make an actual difference.

If the boot was on the other foot, If I lived in minority community in another country and the St. Georges Cross was used by a divisive and tabloid hungry fuckwit like Kopkins, to paint me as a paedophile despite the fact that I don't fuck kids, I would undeniably say that she's being racist and is inciting racial hatred. It wouldn't matter if a load of British boys had done what a load Pakistani men did in the North because, and this the most important part, I know that residents of a country are not pathologically evil. Proof being that I have Pakistani friends who don't fuck kids. They are not insidious or dishonest people. Shitty culture is the problem. You overcome that through social integration and NOT an attitude of THEM vs US.

In the UK we don't tolerate racial hatred, because whether or not you're a proponent of free speech, it doesn't contribute to a cohesive society, instead it belittles and intimidates the members of it.

Yeah we have a choice between the selfish and the incompetent. We get to sit here and try and decide who is the least bad out of a group of people who lie and present misleading information on what they are going to do. Then we throw shit at each other arguing that our guy is less bad than their guy. 

I find it completely unacceptable that we must choose someone who has absolutely no obligation or accountability to stand by anything that they have said in the past, who lies about their objectives and lies about their opponents, and that our choice comes down to the lesser of two evils because our votes are largely ineffectual if we live in marginal constituencies.

Just remember that when you vote, whomever wins will continue to disrupt the middle east, continue to spy on citizens, and continue to favour banks and multinationals and shady agreements over the well being of citizens and working people the world over.

Stop lying to yourselves that voting will make a big difference. It wasn't labour or the conservatives that caused the global financial crisis, it was capitalism. They both support capitalism and war, they are both as culpable as each other. Stop pretending you give a shit about politics if you are only willing to engage in voting for one of the top five election candidates - you are writing off three quarters of the political spectrum just because you can't be bothered to consider anything outside of electoral politics. Just because you've been told ""these are your only choices, deal with it."" You are limiting yourself to a small selection that are all essentially the same. You're not a ""rebel"" or ""shaking things up"" for voting Green or UKIP, nothing significant will change and you're legitimising a system that doesn't give a shit about you. 

We need to abstract ourselves from this idea that voting for one of the main political parties is the only option when it comes to determining the laws that govern our society, economy and foreign policy.

If you want to say ""Oh but it's not realistic to try and change the system"" then you must also admit that you are defeatist, not interesting in effectual change, and not really interested in engaging seriously with politics.",null,0,null,1427801019,null,0,1427801567,0,cpwjjtk,null,t3_30uaig,null,t1_cpwjjtk,null,t3_30uaig,null,null,null,1432114108,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Dear AgentCunts

As you are aware

1. On 20th March 2015 I paid a deposit of Â£200 to your company with reference to the rental flat at 15 Acacia Gardens.
2. The deposit, you will remember, was paid on the condition that I could move in on 27th March 2015, and that half of the rent of Â£500 would be payable on move-in date, with the remainder falling due on 7th April 2015.
3. On 25th March 2015, I was told that you were unable to fulfil the conditions in (2), and I asked for my deposit back.
4. You agreed that the deposit should be refunded.
5. You incorrectly suggested that I should ask AdminCunts for for my deposit back. However, the law states that as the deposit was paid to you, then you must return it.
6. I have contacted you five times and you are now refusing to take my calls or return my deposit.

Please contact me on 0777 777 777, or reply to this email,  within the next 5 working days to let me know when I can collect my deposit from your offices.

I'm afraid that if you don't get in touch, I'll have no choice but to issue a claim for the money through the Small Claims Court, and report you to The Property Ombudsman.

I am sure we can solve this situation amicably.

The thing with the environmetal impacts is that this is entirely true of traditional crops. Monocultures have existed for generations. People have only used the plants with the most beneficial properties since time began.

Also, ""Inside the Commons"" (BBC Doc) revealed there to be a rebel group of around 20 Tory MP's who are all defending their seats. They are very right wing, and quiet supporters of Nigel. If they hold them, I can see a sudden mass defection to UKIP, which will put UKIP in as a party of 20+ seats, and possible coalition partners.

The biggest problem we have is that the SNP are holding their cards very close to their chest and appear to be reluctant to work with any English party right now. 

I personally think they are hoping to get the original higher prediction of 56 seats, will declare an outright mandate for complete independence, and literally walk away from the UK. I think its going to go a bit Irish in that regard. 

I can see a possible constitutional Crisis in the UK this time, and as much as she doesn't want to, HRH is going to be forced to intervene. 

A few weeks ago, one of the senior clerks inside the Commons who dealt with the 2010 coalition dealings, has said that this time is far more aggressive, adversarial, and theres nothing short of a Civil War inside parliament going on right now.  

No-one wants to be seen working with anyone else it seems, and I can tell you now that the Lib Dems are heavily divided on the issue of coalition.

Islamic countries are still largely war-torn and harsh environments. It doesn't excuse anything, but unfortunately those situations promote authoritarianism and fanatical religious beliefs.
Islamic culture as a whole needs to grow the fuck up and start treating people properly, especially women and children. But lets not forget how recently we have evolved our own culture. That just 20 years ago homosexuality was shunned and even criminalised, that 40 years ago there was beheadings in France, that 120 years ago women had so few rights that it was legal to rape and beat your wife.    

Culture changes take time. Right now our cultures aren't compatible, but there's absolutely no reason why they can't be in future. It just takes patience.   
I honestly, truly, believe that British-Muslims will develop their own culture separate to that of the more radical beliefs in the Middle East.

Democracy is the rule of the people. *demos* means ""the people"". 

The head of state in the UK is a Christian and member of the church of England, by constitutional law. 

The upper legislative chamber, known as the house if lords, grants automatic membership to bishops in the church of England. 

The state broadcaster, the BBC, forces the good word down our throats at about 8:45 every morning on radio 4, and is required by law to broadcast a certain proportion of religious content. 

You mention usurpation of the demos. We don't live in a democracy. Formal power lies with the queen in parliament. Informal power lies with a state-corporate establishment elite, not with the people. Why not try proposing the abolition of these fundamental unions of church and state. You will be told they are mere symbols of an old order inherited from a misty past.

The key reason for this rise is that the training and prep servicemen and women receive is now out of step with their experiences on the ground.

I've never met a jock who had a problem with going up against a trained, skilled enemy even when outnumbered, with armour support, artillery cover and air cover if needed. That's just battle: they're trained for it, experienced in it and by and large handle it with exceptional courage and skill. I firmly believe that the British forces are the best in the world in this role.

But it's not what they're being asked to do now. Now they're fighting an invisible enemy who fights ""dirty"" - guerilla tactics, IEDs and snipers all the way. That produces stresses which the personnel are often not well trained or equipped to cope with. They do their best but the results are inevitable and that's what we're seeing over here.

I said Labour played a key role in creating the conditions for turning what should have been a localised US housing crisis into a global credit crunch via the creation of a fragmented regulatory environment. 

They did not cause the US subprime crisis, nor did they cause the european debt crisis. 

As a consequence of lack of oversight, caused by fragmented oversight, activities that were tightly regulated elsewhere moved to the UK where they flourished, as [traders ""found a crack in the system that was unregulated,""](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7045889).

Again, Id say you misunderstand me. As a minority opposition, there are natural limitations to what an opposition government can do. **Please also note that I said the Tories probably did support it, and that they are not the guardian angels or stoic heroes.**

One way that we can do that, with a proven record of success, is to accept immigration and integrate it into our own culture, thereby spreading the good aspects of our culture back to their home countries.

You say Torres left us at a crucial time...he left us while we were down. He wasn't going to get the football he deserved anytime soon. Suarez left us when we were a piece or two away from the title. He set us back from fighting for title, to fighting for top 4. 

Torres left for a trophy chasing team. A team he was in a position to win trophies with. It was our rivals, which sucks, but can you really argue against ambition? Suarez tried to force through a move to Arsenal, who do have constant champions league, but also hadn't competed for anything in a while much like ourselves. It wasn't as big of a step up as Torres to Chelsea at the time. If anything this would be more damaging to us as it would strengthen a positional rival, in the battle for 4th (realistically at the time, Chelsea were too far ahead to contemplate challanging despite how it turned out)

So if we can forgive Suarez the second he leaves, I think it's fair to forgive Torres 4 years on.

The first was the day I bought my Varadero 125, and my first solo ride ever. The ride went flawlessly and I was so relieved as I pulled into my driveway and stuck my foot out only to find the ground was further away than I thought it was. By the time I'd realised, the bike was beyond saving, so went over and wedged me under my own car. I panicked, clutched in and cracked back on the throttle so my bike is on the side and bouncing off the redline for a few seconds while I'm wedged under the car. Just to make sure everyone in the surrounding area was aware of my incompetence. I needed my mate to help me out of that one.

The second was about a month after I bought my ER-6f. I was on holiday with my parents in south Wales and had opted to ride down and meet them there. It was the last day and I was a little pre-occupied going over the return journey in my head while I wheeled the bike out from behind the house. While walking alongside I cut too close to the corner of the house and left myself no room between the house and the bike. Of course the bike started to fall away from me and having my back to the wall I was in no position to pull it back. It landed on a small wall which actually saved it from most of the expensive damage thankfully.

Third time was about a week later and was less of a drop and more of a crash. Was riding on a road I'd never been on and was caught out by a sharp decreasing radius corner. Banked the bike right over and lowsided. The bike and I slid down the road at like 40mph causing some pretty serious cosmetic damage to the bike, but I was completely fine. I did need to buy new boots and textiles though. I also bought some crash bungs after this, but still haven't fixed my fairings yet though.

&gt; The problem is we have been eating meat for millions of years out of necessity. Farming and agriculture and raising animals for meat, milk &amp; eggs is what has allowed us to become what we are today.

That might be true (not sure about milk &amp; eggs), but at this point most of the people browsing reddit are no longer in a position where they need to eat meat to survive and be healthy.

&gt; There are billions around the world who still rely on it, they simply couldn't fully lead a vegan lifestyle.

This is the [definition](http://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/definition-veganism) of veganism:

*Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.*

If you need some specific animal product to survive, it isn't possible/practicable to exclude it, so in that sense everybody could be a vegan. 

That said, your point was probably that it isn't possible for everyone to stop eating meat. In my opinion the problem these people have isn't that they *need* meat, but that they *don't have access* to sufficient amounts of healthy plant-based foods. I won't blame people living in such conditions for eating meat, but I do blame the rest of the population for allowing this problem to exist. Everyone should be able to maintain a healthy diet and producing plant-based foods is the most efficient way of achieving this goal.

&gt; It is only very recently that we have intensive rearing of animals, it has moved away from keeping animals and only using what we needed, using everything, it has become throwaway, people are massively removed from the whole process, the respect for the animal has been lost.

I agree.

&gt; I can't forsee ever the human race being vegan, but I think people could question how much and what meat they eat.

I'm hopeful that most of the world population will switch to a plant-based diet eventually. It just makes sense. I encourage people to consider not eating meat at all, or to slowly move towards a vegetarian diet.

Suarez, for example, was a much more volatile, career-driven player, who as I said before brought a lot of stress and bad-press to the club. He tried to leave and tried to force his way out through a series of high-publicity incidents, until the point where the club literally HAD to sell him. Ok, he moved to Barcelona, but that is only because the club were able to say no to Arsenal. He would have moved to Arsenal if he could.

Torres was nothing but a positive role model at and for the club, and he quietly asked (or got Gerrard to ask, as far as I remember) Kenny to let him leave. Big big difference. Yet nobody is saying Suarez should have been booed. WHy do you think that is? Logic? OR passion based around how much the player meant at the time?

Women have been fighting for their rights in the middle east for just as long as women in the west have, and they deserve all the praise for the progress they have made. When Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Taliban, the world recognised her bravery, not because she was standing up for ""western"" values, but because she was standing up for the rights of women across the middle east. Rights that have been fought over for hundreds of years, and which have nothing to do with the west. To imply that the west is to thank for the changes in the middle east is offensive to the people who are making the real sacrifices.

Just doing a few sums on your figures, a few questions:

* Is this her only income for this tax year? 
* What tax code is she on? I suspect you'll find ""M1"" or ""BR"" on her tax code - she should not be paying tax if she hasn't yet reached her personal allowance of Â£10k for the year. 

If what they've done is accurate, she will have paid higher NI contributions (by about Â£60), higher student loan contributions (about Â£50, depending on the plan she's on), and an extra Â£100 towards tax than if the adjustment was made prior to any deductions. 

The fact that she's paying tax / potentially on the wrong tax code is one to pick up with HMRC, but certainly the payroll department should sort this error out. 

I've had a go at working out what I think she should be paying, based on the information you've given...

**http://i.imgur.com/dOmPujM.png**

If I've sussed everything out right, the way they've done things here means she has actually lost around Â£240 due to the fact that the payment was split, and they took the money back after tax.

Fuck. Right. Off.

Booing him when he came back with Chelsea, fair enough. But to boo him years later, at a charity game, does nothing except make us as Liverpool fans look petty and pathetic; a description which sums up your post pretty well.

As others have said, he now seems to genuinely realise how good he had it when he was with us, and regrets the manner of his departure. We can't just forget how shit a position the club was in a when he left, and he's far from the only player who has claimed they were constantly being made promises, only to see them broken again and again (Alonso, Babel and Mascherano have all said similar). Chelsea were prepared to offer us silly money for him, and - considering he'd spent most of the six months prior to that sulking his way around the pitch - I'm not surprised we accepted. He's said before that the full details around his transfer still aren't known, and probably won't be until he's retired, and I'll take him at his word on that. I woudn't at all be surprised if a lot of the things that were said and done at that time were more down to the clubs involved, and not the personal belief of the player.

&gt;__William Henry__ ""__Billy__"" __Meredith__ (30 July 1874Â â 19 April 1958) was a [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people) [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football). He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for [Manchester City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.) and [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.).  He won each domestic trophy in the [English football league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system) and gained 48 caps for [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_national_football_team), for whom he scored 11 goals and won two [British Home Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Home_Championship) titles. His favoured position was [outside right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_forward), and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing, and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a [toothpick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpick) during games made him instantly recognisable.

Similarly to most people, I'd like to see Kolo, Manquillo, Lucas, Sterling and Lambert staying.

Lambert because of sentiment (I'd love to see him retire with Liverpool). Manquillo because of his potential, and Sterling because well, Sterling.

If they do, I'd say it leaves with roughly (on the high side) Â£35m in sales, which is a good start towards a transfer budget.

If Sterling does leave, we need to flog him to a European club, preferably for between Â£25m and Â£40m.
