Lloyds Personal Term Loan

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

But if for any reason I miss payments and have arrears it'd show for the number of payments I've missed. Arrears are capped at the number six.

So say I had a tragic incident and can't keep up with my loan payments any longer, it'd show as:

Lloyds Personal Term Loan

0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 6 6

On paper, yes, it is, but I feel we need to be conscious of the fact that we're living in an increasingly globally-focused economy. Businesses are bigger and better equipped to negate legislation through force of presence - they can essentially threaten to withdraw their contributions to the tax pots.

Regional devolution will be left exposed to this. Small counties will not have the political clout to encourage compliance with regulatory requirements, and the implication is that as power is distributed regionally that the central government will be essentially stripped down too.

Not to mention that the population is becoming increasingly focused on the leadership rather than the rest of the party. Are we going to see unstable local politics as people vote for the leadership they want instead of their preferred local candidate?

What she is is Doctor Who's prolonged apology to women for that whole Sarah Jane Smith feminist-mockery in the 1970s. Basically the cast of ShitRedditSays turned up en masse to bully Moff into being fairer or more equitable.

So the Doctor is no longer a really clever, conquering hero- every time he's been in some kind of scrape or in danger, it was actually a know-it-all-across-all-of-time 20something brunette who likes souffles who did whatever it took to keep him alive. He has no more agency anymore, and it means that every episode prior to her showing up is pointless to watch because she's the Deus Ex Machina to show that the Doctor's never been in any danger whatsoever.

Which of course gives her the right and carte blanche to talk to him like a four year old she found smearing shit on the wall - lecturing him when she's not hectoring him. And so of course, not only do they have him begging her for her friendship and help, but they even have TWO incarnations doing so - the beautiful doe-eyed one saying ""please hang around old ugly me. I need you.""

When she's not dictating the policy to all the men around her ""you're taking me out for a drink? Course you are."" and mocking any kind of insecurity around her ""oh, were you sitting there having an imaginary conversation with me while I was standing in the corner with my arms folded? Yeah, ha ha, that's modern woman all right. Know it all, always right and always catching you doing something. But I forgive you. Now do what I want.""

No shade against the actress, she plays an insufferable modern bitch to a T. But the character is complete poison and I for one will start watching more in earnest when it stops being the Clara show. I know Who have figured out women buy more merch, but for fuck's sake.

My understanding is that this is only the case if the landlord intends to keep the white goods beyond the duration of the tenancy i.e the furnished goods become part of the let.

Nasri was a big reason for conceding one of the goals against Barca because he didn't track back, I predicted Pellers would put in Navas at half time and I was right. That's why Pellers prefers him too, as well as because he stretches defenses. 

People just look at their attacking ability and that's why most people think Navas is useless. He's definitely the least technically gifted of our attacking midfielders, but he brings a lot to the team and makes the whole squad better. With Sterling in the squad, he has more space, so he is playing better too. This season he's been looking less one-dimensional and I'm loving it.

null,null,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,null,"&gt; Even if you think there's going to be a great depression, stockpiling tins of tomatoes isn't going to help you anyway. In the 30s the depression lasted for years. You'd be better off digging over your back lawn into a veg garden and keeping chickens.

Stockpiling preserved food seems like a good idea to me, *if* it is warranted. At the moment we rely on logistics to get us our food. A few years back when there were problems with fuel supply and the ""boycott the pumps"" thing, there were worries lorries wouldn't reach shops to restock them. If something happened that cut off our petrol supply, we'd run out of food sharpish because food needs fuel to get to shops. Without daily restocking of food, combined with *other people* stocking up, we'd soon see some food trouble. Thus even a short-term situation that cuts the petrol/deisel supply would lead to food supply problems. We wouldn't run out, but unless you live near a distribution centre or a packaging factory you'd be shit out of luck in terms of obtaining it.

In the long term, it'd be a good idea too. Sure, we'd keep chickens and grow vegetables all Dig for Victory style (assuming you've got a back lawn, those of us living in flats would be in trouble; we might get a tub of onions on our juliette balcony and some herbs in the kitchen but that won't feed us for long), but a potato plant or a carrot isn't just going to grow instantly. And the more you have to begin with, the longer you'll last when the supplies stop arriving - and the more likely it is you'll last til whatever you're growing has grown.

So if the situation was particularly serious, stocking up on food would be a good idea, even if it lasts for years.",null,0,null,1440437826,null,null,false,0,cue3jy2,null,t3_3i7n8e,null,null,null,t1_cue1pwm,null,null,null,1441443631,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

By co-incidence my family and I were passengers on a flight into LGW at about the same time as this accident. Commercial flights occasionally crash into urban areas, sometimes killing hundreds of people, and it was just a holiday flight for our enjoyment, therefore this too was an unnecessary risk.

So instead of going on holiday we could have stayed at home and maybe driven for a day out to the South Downs. But driving is far more risky than flying: we could have hit a cyclist or pedestrian. This would just be a trip out for our enjoyment, therefore this too would have been an unnecessary risk.

The end point of this logic is that we should stay at home and watch TV instead. It's reasonable to try to minimise unnecessary risk, but not to eliminate it altogether.

I won't do you the disservice of not answering what you're probably really asking - would Assange get a lesser sentence than your fictional violent park rape scenario. Given that it's violent, it probably would (if Assange had complied with police from the start). Other exacerbating circumstances would be if the victim was a child, or had a mental illness, etc. I don't think it's fair to compare that to the difference between murder and manslaughter (can you accidentally rape someone?).

&gt; The elections left the body fundamentally weakened from its inception as an overall majority had been obtained by **those Unionists who opposed power sharing as a concept**. As a result the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention Report published on 20 November 1975[2] recommended only a return to majority rule as had previously existed under the old Parliament of Northern Ireland government. As such a solution was completely unacceptable to the nationalist parties, the NICC was placed on hiatus.
&gt; 
 &gt; Hoping to gain something from the exercise, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees announced that the NICC would be reconvened on 3 February 1976. However, **a series of meetings held between the UUUC and the SDLP failed to reach any agreement about SDLP participation in government**, and so the reconvened NICC once again failed to achieve a solution with cross-community support. As a result, Rees announced the dissolution of the body on 4 March 1976 and Northern Ireland remained under direct rule. ^[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Constitutional_Convention)

The vast majority of unionists were opposed to power sharing as is evidenced by their actions in any follow up attempts even with the ""Irish dimension"" removed. To caterogise the UWC strike as solely about the Irish Governments involvement is complete nonsense. 

As for the Dublin/Monaghan Bombings it's not my conspiracy theory; The Irish Government is currently seeking [Documents](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/government-seeking-documents-on-dublin-monaghan-bombs-1.1800094) regarding the matter and there certainly seems to be a case to [answer](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/26/northernireland.ireland).

The great british bake-off brought in 12.3M viewers for the final. So something you're proposing is to take away the shows most people want despite the goal being to improve the value.

People's complaints seem to be both about:

1. Very popular shows since they could be done elsewhere
2. Unpopular shows since nobody watches them

Taken both to the extremes we'd have no shows at all. Remove the most popular and you're losing the best cost per viewer TV, remove the least popular and you're canning things that wouldn't have been picked up elsewhere because they're expensive per viewer.

Where's the line to be drawn? Effectively penalise the BBC for producing things people like? I'd have thought the bake-off would have had basically no viewers, and then we'd have all mocked it for producing such a rubbish show.

If we trim all the things not everyone likes we'd be left with only Attenborough (although that does sound good).

On paper, buying that sort of player for more than £10 million doesn't sound that exciting.

'Freight rates for container shipping from Asia to Europe fell by over 20pc in the second week of August, even though trade volumes should be picking up at this time of the year. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) for routes to north European ports crashed by 23pc in five trading days.'

I mean the Germans are incredibly productive but quite obviously inept diplomatically in their handling of the Greeks, the French have a certain faded majesty but their economy is in the toilet. The Eastern European nations have vim but are too small to make a big difference, Scandinavia is mostly aloof and most of Southern Europe is sliding into economic collapse.

What's needed is a country that has the space to see outside the European box , (some) economic credibility, and top-table diplomatic links to march over to Brussels and do what Thatcher did, but in reverse. Get respect for being singleminded and committed to pulling the EU out of crisis, and then taking credit for it. Everything seems to be done by committee, with the predictable result that the EU is paid for by the Germans but like a hippy commune nobody is really in charge when a crisis happens.

And us, look at us, aren't we particularly pathetic right now? Even the debate here is pathetic.  Instead of this meek ""let's do what the French and Germans say"" or the fantasist ""let's sail out into the middle of the Atlantic and put our fingers in our ears"" this country should realise it's destiny is not inside Europe, it is actually taking charge of Europe. Like a bossy girl school prefect, the UK should roll up our sleeves and get in there. We've been quietly shaping Europe for hundreds of years, the sad thing is popular history only records when we've massively failed or got carried away and wars have resulted. 

It's just galling we won't even countenance getting shit done  until that bloody referendum returns the verdict we're ok with Europe, European, and yes even the EU, and by then it may well be too late.

null,null,The_Inertia_Kid,null,null,null,"Buddy, on £1,300 a month you're going to struggle to get a mortgage due to the affordability criteria. Why is buying a house the be-all and end-all of everything? For most of us, renting is a perfectly acceptable solution during our 20s, and increasingly our 30s too.

You made the mistake of assuming you could afford to rent a property alone on your current salary. Do you perhaps think you could be making the same mistake on whether you can afford to buy?

As far as ending your tenancy goes, you have signed a tenancy until the end of June, and you're liable for rent until the end of June. You can speak to your landlord, but your landlord is under no obligation to allow you to end your lease.

If he is sensible, he will, but there will be a negotiation involved. You will have to convince him that you have no money, and that if he doesn't let you end your tenancy you're going to end up being unable to pay the rent. You have to make it clear that it's in his interest to re-market the property and allow you to move out.

There's no set guideline of how much this might leave you out of pocket - it's what you can negotiate. He might want you to pay the agent's fee. He might want a month's rent.

null,null,JustAhobbyish,,Labour Member,null,"Jeremy Corbyn’s “people’s QE” scheme has been widely discussed in the media. In fact, the key policy of the UK’s opposition leadership candidate has caused something of a storm. The extent of the discussion is far more, in my view, than the idea deserves.

The scheme envisages that a future government would, via a public investment bank, issue bonds for infrastructure development, which would then be bought by the Bank of England as part of a quantitative easing programme.

It aims to address the UK’s desperate need for investment in infrastructure, research and development, skills and social housing. Few would disagree with this. Private and public sector investment in Britain have been well below levels in most other developed countries for a long time. Government investment in the future of the economy is at its lowest for over a decade (ONS, 2014).

Public sector net inv and GFCFBut it is not only investment that is desperately needed; safe assets are, too. Government debt is the safest form of saving available to UK residents. Savers suffer from cripplingly low returns on their savings, in part because the supply of government debt – which makes up a substantial part of pension investments – has been restricted by QE. The BoE currently owns about 30 per cent of the UK’s stock of gilts. For those who live on the returns on their savings, the last few years have been grim, and there is no end in sight: interest rates remain on the floor and the BoE shows no signs of unwinding its QE purchases. The coalition government offered some relief with its pensioner bonds, which offered government bonds at above market rates. But this is a drop in the ocean.

The narrative around government debt is toxic. Because of events in the eurozone and unhelpful academic research, it is widely seen as a burden on future generations, a drag on growth, a source of fiscal vulnerability. But in reality, it is UK citizens’ investment in the future. Pensioners are supported by the returns on their investment, while their children and grandchildren benefit from modern infrastructure and good education. And businesses benefit from investment in R&amp;D and innovation. We need to stop regarding government debt as malign, and start regarding it as a social good.

Of course, borrowing for investment does have limits. When governments are very highly indebted, bond yields may spike. But we are nowhere near that limit. Japan currently has debt of more than 200 per cent of gross domestic product. For much of the last two centuries, the UK’s public debt was well in excess of 100 per cent of national income (Ritschl, 1996).

UK public debt 2 centuriesNeither Japan nor the UK has ever defaulted on public debt. Japanese government bonds and UK gilts are regarded as among the safest investments in the world. Increasing public debt for investment purposes would be unlikely to change this, especially if investors knew the BoE stood ready to buy bonds as a last resort. Having a trusted and effective central bank makes a huge difference to sovereign creditworthiness. It is for this reason that comparisons with Greece are invidious.

But there is an additional problem. The UK is running a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP. How can a substantial investment programme be undertaken without vastly increasing this?

Simply, by separating investment spending from the “current” deficit. The fiscal deficit is due to the fact that the “day-to-day” spending of the government exceeds its revenue. It is too easy for governments to disguise spending over-runs by cutting investment spending.

Cutting investment spending is a false economy. Judicious investment spending raises national income. Investment that results in higher productivity feeding through into higher wages means more tax revenue for government and lower welfare bills. Investment spending has long-term benefits on both sides of the public balance sheet.

Since there is a shortage of safe assets for savers, the government could simply issue bonds directly to the public to fund development projects, as it has done in previous centuries to finance wars. But the need to separate current and investment spending argues for a public investment bank rather than direct public investment. It makes the distinction crystal clear and forces the real returns from investment spending to be recognised in public accounts.

Even better might be a leveraged sovereign wealth fund, which would fund itself by issuing bonds that it would use to purchase assets, potentially including equity stakes in housing, infrastructure developments and innovative start-ups.

Restricting investment spending when interest rates are very low is not responsible management of the economy. Unfortunately, none of the candidates for the Labour leadership have so far pointed this out. All of them – including Mr Corbyn – have tacitly accepted that eliminating the deficit is a top priority and government debt serves no useful purpose. Mr Corbyn at least acknowledges the need for investment, but proposes a form of financial engineering that would deny Britain’s savers the opportunity to invest in their future. In this respect, “people’s QE” it is not.
It would be perfectly acceptable for the BoE to buy “development bonds” as part of a QE programme in a future recession. But I fail to see why investing in the economy should be dependent on there being a recession. I also fail to see why it has to wait for a future government. Her Majesty’s opposition should make the case for significant borrowing for investment now.

I think the diamond is straight ruled out for exactly what you say - I can't see how you press the pitch with the mids so far apart and at different depths.

And I have to cop to not having watched much Atletico, so I can't say much to their implementation.

As for Real Madrid, I think whether they were a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 or something else is largely a matter of nuance, which will probably more rigidly defined with Benitez--Benitez gotta Benitez.  I haven't checked in on Real this season, I'll admit.

One could even challenge your premise, and say that that's how capitalism works, but only if everyone's a self-serving asshole who thinks of nothing but their own profits.  If every large institution ""gave away"" parts of their profits, in the form of forgiving loans to people who can't pay their mortgage, *that* would be how capitalism works.  It's always a matter of choice.

Additionally, if we want to get more philosophical, we could argue that if this is how capitalism works, it just shows how capitalist systems are, at their very core, hostile to humanity, and should be abolished, or so strictly regulated that it would hardly be recognisable as capitalism.

He does a really good job of grappling with some pretty dark parts of our nature, identifying some of the most troubling, subconscious beliefs that I think a lot of us have.  The humor that he uses to deal with these topics is, I think, quintessential American male humor - vulgar potty humor.  I grew up with that kind of humor and a good poop joke just makes me laugh.  A poop joke about what makes us human and personal identity is even more entertaining for me (I saw him do this joke last night when I was watching one of his acts on Netflix).  I think Louis CK is saying some pretty insightful things and sugar coating it with a style of humor that he and most American males grew up with.  

The same is true for Southpark.  Southpark is high quality satire.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone use a lot of absurd scatological humor to get their message across, but they often make really interesting points.  My mom (who is British) can't stand Southpark, and I can't blame her because she didn't grow up with that kind of humor, but she is missing out on some good satire.  And I'm sure she would happily go watch Book of Mormon on Broadway, even though it's the same kind of satire coated with the same kind of vulgar humor written by the same writers as Southpark.

As you didn't give the keys back your tenancy has become what's known as a statutory periodic tenancy, you are now strictly speaking on a rolling month to month contract from the 17th of each month until the 16th. In order to end this you need to give your landlord notice that you intend to move out. Again strictly speaking this would mean that the earliest date you would be able to leave on* is the 16th October as technically you can't give one calendar months worth (as the law requires) although you should check your tenancy agree as it may specify another time frame for giving notice.

The only way to leave now is for you to negotiate with the landlord. You are on the back foot here as they are not acting illegally. My understanding is that the deposit service would probably find in favour of your landlord for this reason. Your best bet would be to disagree with the alternative dispute resolution service and let him take it to court - then convince the court that you should only pay the pro-rata amount. A fairly optimistic resolution I think...

Of course if the landlord has not protected your deposit then follow the advice from /u/starrieeyes

Benteke and Cou look dangerous whenever they have the ball. Firm is giving away possession a little too much but he's doing fairly well. Milner is all over the pitch.

Honestly in all honesty, with how their back four are playing, anything less than 3 points would be disappointing with how we've played in the first half.

I'd like to write up a longer reply to this at some point (so hopefully I will remember), but I'd say that whether it is successful depends on what exactly is devolved. Things such as housing, transport, powers over education etc, greater control over public investment in the area - these would not necessarily be effected by the problems that you mention, whilst devolving tax powers (especially, say, corporation tax) or certain specific regulatory powers would almost certainly be effected, so what is devolved is just as important.

&gt; Not to mention that the population is becoming increasingly focused on the leadership rather than the rest of the party. Are we going to see unstable local politics as people vote for the leadership they want instead of their preferred local candidate?

I think this would be somewhat mitigated by the nature of the issues and the connection between the issues and the voter, that arise from being more local. This problem on the focus of the leadership, to me, stems from how incomprehensible some of the national issues can seem to the average voter, and the intense media focus upon specific personalities in politics. I don't think you'd see these playing such a large part when things are on a smaller stage.

If you're interested in giving him a go, here's a piece that I think is pretty culture neutral. All you need to know for this bit is there's a strong natural English-Scottish rivalry in the UK. And Glasgow is a place known for being hard as nails..

OP, how did you not anticipate these costs? You knew what your rent and bills were going to be before you moved in right? A good calculation to remember for the future is 30 x the rent: if you want to rent a flat that's £1000 PCM, you should be earning around £30,000 PA. And that's your minimum. 

Do you rent through an agency? Most agencies will allow you to sever your contrast, but it'll cost you. I pay £785 PCM and rent through a mid-level agency, and it would cost £400 to sever my contract (I looked into it when my partner and I broke up unexpectedly). It sounds like you've got yourself into a really sticky situation and taking that hit would be far better than a whole year of rent you can't afford. But only your agency can tell you whether you can take this route as each one is different. 

If it's just through a landlord, if they are very generous and reasonable, they may allow you to leave but charge you remarketing costs, but you will still be liable for rent until he/she can find a new tenant.

Sorry about the legs / bike / arm. That is shit. What others have said about notifying your insurance is true (although I'm not sure it's a legal requirement) if they find out you they can refuse to continue to insure you and it will be much harder to get insurance having been refused somewhere else.

This page from Which has some good info:

So...you're the arbiter of all that is racist then? Glad you came out of your long lurk to post this and clarify it for all of us.

&gt; Guarantee if he was white this would not even be talked about. On that point this has never even been brought up till this idiot posted it. 

The fact that he's black isn't what the OP has issue with here. The fact that he's from Africa is what the OP is questioning. Is it racist to say Africa has bad infrastructure and industry? No, I'm stating a fact. Is it racist to say that Africa has had scandals in the past with people not being the age they claim or that Berahino has a receding hairline? No, those are both facts.

Are taking those two points together and asking if Berahino is as old as he says stupid? I totally agree with you there. Stupid yes, but not racist.

Why are some people so god damn sensitive? Someone comes out and points out a few different things and you cry racism. The people that act like you are are the ones that turn nothing into racism and just make shit worse. Many of my friends are black people and I can make jokes about receding hairlines and Africans lying about their age all I want - they won't give a shit because *it's not insulting someone because of their race.* Seriously the only people that get so insulted over this dumb ass shit are white people.

Get this white guilt bullshit out of here. If someone makes a stupid post call it stupid and move on. Don't try and pretend it's racist because you're overly sensitive.

It involves relying on the linesman way too much and top teams will tear it apart. The whole Terry uproar needs to be brought back to some common sense. Terry had one of his best ever seasons last year. Two poor games early on happens to anybody (look at Rooney). The problem is that when Terry plays, the other partner needs to be very aware of his surroundings. We saw it last year and we are seeing it this year, Cahill's marking is atrocious and I think if we get Stones then a Stones-JT partnership would be good. But the real liability in our back line is Ivanovic. Even last year, his being caught too far forward and inability to match wingers for pace has cost us. The only reason this was left unnoticed was due to the fact that he was a genuine goal threat. Since Matic and Fabregas have been so poor so far this season, Ivanovic's mistakes are becoming very evident. If you watch West Brom's goals yesterday, Matic is to blame for both. On the first goal he was left ball-watching and left Morrison completely wide open. For the second goal, I dont blame him too much because that was a fantastic header but he still failed to beat Morrison who was his man. For City's goals, you could possible make an argument for JT being caught too far up the pitch but you can see Cahill completely lounge in at Aguero and leave him 1 on 1 while the second goal was Ivanovic failing to properly mark Kompany. On the third, Ivanovic once again lethargically receives the ball without looking up and careless give it away to Silva who plays in Fernandinho. It is easy to look at a tactical substitution and one red card and come to the conclusion that Terry is the issue but if you break down all the goals weve conceded, it's really clear that our defensive problems lye far deeper than John Terry. That is why it is so imperative that we 1) sign Stones and 2) find another dynamic, hardworking central midfielder (ie Paul Pogba, Ilkay Gundogan, Marco Veratti) to help protect that back 4 because Matic and Fabregas are not going to be perfect all the time.

I think it's inevitable that paramilitary organisations continue to exist in NI, across the board. I don't think that the IRA is focused much on drug dealing or violence though. PIRA has always, as unionists love to mention, been wedded to Sinn Fein; they share the same fortunes. It damages SF electorally all over Ireland to be associated with either drug dealing or violence, therefore PIRA does not at the organisational level engage in that. Just because a couple of rogue members took someone out for a personal feud, doesn't mean that the organisation is no longer on ceasefire. I mean how many fucking loyalists have been shot in the past few years? Loads, the PSNI still resisted from saying that the UVF had broken their ceasefire, for example.

Will taking in a lodger affect your Housing Benefit?

If you get Housing Benefit (HB), the first £20 of weekly income from a lodger is ignored and won't affect your benefit. If meals are included, 50 per cent of anything over the £20 is also ignored.

Example

John charges his lodger £30 per week, which doesn't include meals or any other services. £20 of this would be disregarded which means that the remaining £10 is treated as income when working out how much HB John would be entitled to each week.

If you're a working-age social housing tenant and you have one or more 'spare' bedrooms, you may be paying some money towards your rent already because your HB has been reduced. This is known as the 'under-occupancy charge', the 'social sector size criteria reduction', the 'removal of the spare room subsidy' or the 'bedroom tax'.

If you take in a lodger, you'll be treated as needing a bedroom for the lodger for HB purposes. This means that your HB won't be reduced because the bedroom is no longer 'spare', although the rent that you get from the lodger counts as income, as explained above.

Different rules apply if you rent a room to a family member. The bedroom wouldn't be considered as a spare room, but your HB may be reduced because of a 'non-dependant deduction'. The amount of the deduction depends on your relative's income, but sometimes it can be ignored. For example, if you receive certain components of some disability benefits. If you're thinking about renting a room to a family member it may be best to speak to an adviser first to see how this could affect you.

I like Berahino a ton. I want us to sign Berahino. I think he's very, very probably 22 and I apologize sincerely if raising age as a question comes across as racist to anyone.

I do think that the age question is something that's worth considering with respect to any unusually precocious player (Berahino is not ridiculously precocious, but scoring 14 goals in the prem at age 21 definitely qualifies as precocious) who emigrated to the UK from a country where age fraud seems like a possibility and at an age that would facilitate age fraud. I 100% believe I'd ask the same question of Harry Kane had he been born in North Korea to a captured US soldier and emigrated to the UK at the age of 10. The vast majority of players born in countries where age fraud is feasible will be their stated age, but when you're spending 20 million pounds on a guy, it's still an important question, not unlike the question of whether a guy has a bum knee.

Let me also say that if I was Berahino's mother, and my son seemed a precocious football talent at age 10, I'd certainly think about lying about his age to give him a leg up on getting into WBA's academy. It might not be ethical but I could understand wanting to give your kid every advantage and I might well do the same. In the (unlikely) event that Berahino isn't 22, *good on him* but bad for Tottenham and WBA.

I think it's a shame that so many people view even asking the question as racist. Would speculating about whether he is injury prone be racist? It could be (""He seems to sit out every time he gets a scratch. Harry Kane wouldn't miss those games.""), but it depends on the way in which someone speculates and what they say.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I do respect why people are suspicious that my post might be racially motivated, and I do think a certain suspicion on that score is healthy. There is a fair amount of racism that goes on with respect to Berahino, witness this post on twitter just now:

https://twitter.com/Albionwestand/status/635832720892035072

THAT is racist.

Anyone who views Berahino's drunk driving and nitrous incidents as a huge red flag but gives somebody like Grealish or Jack Wilshere a pass for their behavior is being racist. I can't point fingers at any speficic person or media article here, but I'd wager that the media and fans are usually harder on black players who have Berahino/Grealish/Wilshere type incidents (""he has bad character"") than they are on white players (""he's immature"").

I also, btw, am deeply suspicious that the media and fans tend to ascribe character defects to black players more than they do to white players.

&gt;In 2010, Benoit stated that he “plays for the money” and football is “like a job”. So from what we see, Assou-Ekotto is just a lazy footballer content with earning a lot whilst not doing anything to help his club.

I tend to think that if Benny had been white, you wouldn't have had people questioning his character or calling him ""lazy"", just his talent, his fit in AVB's system, and AVB's (to my mind strange) dislike of Benny.

Even with guys like Adebayor and Balotelli, where it seems likely that there are some real effort issues (in Ade's case) or maturity issues (in Mario's case) I think that they get a lot more flak and character criticism because of the color of their skin. It boggles the mind that Balotelli keeping £15,000 in the glovebox of his car was reported as if it was some sort of sign of immaturity. Heck, most of the critical anecdotes about Balotelli concern things that seem completely unimportant or carry the whiff of racism (how dare a young black player flaunt his wealth).

Personally I admire the heck out of Berahino's background and what he's overcome, I think he's a fantastic young English player (and lets be clear, regardless of where he was born, he's as English as it gets) and I have no worries about his character-- he's handled this transfer process with as much or more class than most players, and the DUI and nitrous incidents strike me as small beer/minor growing pains. But I have a slight, niggling concern about the incentive that would have existed when he first emigrated to lie about his age and whether it's possible he's slightly older than has been reported.",null,0,null,1440448031,null,null,1440450590,0,cueaaeg,null,t3_3i7oe1,null,null,null,t1_cue9bet,null,null,null,1441446870,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

The key problem here is that people believe China has been artificially inflating its economic figures. Because of this there will be an effect on your company, particularly as faith in China's economy drops and this translates into tangible falls in demand.

However having said that China's stock market is comparatively tiny (i.e. stock market value vs GDP) vs Western nations and so there is less to worry about. In addition the Shanghai stock market is still significantly up on 12 months ago. 

Ultimately yes it will have an impact. However there will be significantly more important factors to your company than this (for example its level of debt etc). A drop in China's growth rate from 7% to say 5% won't end your employer despite the impacts on the stock market.

He has potential but right now I find him to be the weak link every time he's on.

I don't know if Markovic is better and if Firmimo is fit enough, but right now that's just what it is to me. Play him in cup games.

I can't speak for London parking but I noticed you love your bike!

One thing that may not have occurred to you about England in the winter is that it is not only cold and wet, it also incredibly salty on the roads. This is because they are gritted when the temperature drops to freezing to help keep them clear of ice. The salt mix will eat your bike.

Before it gets really cold have a look at services like All Weather Biker (I think?).  Which can clean and coat your bike with a full coating of Acf50 anti-corrosion. 

Or at least get a can of it yourself, clean your bike, and then apply the Acf50 in the autumn. Then apply extra Scottoiler Fs365 at the end of a wet ride. Even though your bike will be filthy underneath it won't be rusting. In the spring give it a good clean and it should be sparkling for the summer!

Riding in bad weather is not as bad as some make outand it sounds like you have plenty of experience of it. Day-to-day out it can be tiring and your body may need more calories than you are used to, so a good breakfast helps! Sense of humour and patience is good too. 

All employers and workplaces are different. You may just have your desk and a chair to hang wet stuff from, but it is always worth asking if there is a cupboard or cloakroom you can use, even if only for the really bad days. Some people keep a smart change of clothes in the office and change out of riding gear for the day.

Again, to me it's not *just* that he was born and for the first 10 years of his life grew up in a country that probably has shoddy recordkeeping, but that he also is a precocious player with a lot of success at a young age and subjectively I think he looks old for his age (though not as old as Wayne Rooney looked at 22).

Even all of that together doesn't provide a strong reason to doubt he's 22-- it just creates enough of a question that I thought it was worth asking how definitively his age has been established.

Its simply fixing what is quite evidently a non-functioning system.

Non-functioning because no working democracy in the world requires 90% consensus of the elected individuals to the legislature.

Love that. Wish Chris Rock would talk more, and Seinfeld came off like a dickhead but yeah. 

People always say Ricky is the odd one out there, but I'm not so sure. He has at least as many comedy credentials as Louis does. 

It's clear some of them don't see Ricky as a real stand up. Not sure I'd agree.

- **Firmino**: still settling in, sparks but what I liked most about him today was his defensive contributions. 

- **Can**: very solid, couple of great tackles but needs to turn on the ball more. Number of times he received the ball to feet with ample space behind him to turn and get his head up but he keeps facing back towards goal or to the wings. 

- **Lucas**: we need him. He wasn't at his best but the way he controlled the space in front of the back four was exceptional. Couple of times he really put Ozil in his place for saying ""we know how to beat Liverpool"" before the match. 

- **Benteke**: So close... still needs to gel with the rest of the attack and vice versa. That moment when he just outbuffed Chambers and ran on goal was exactly what we want to see.

I don't know what happened in the second half, but we looked quite toothless. First half we were creating most of the time, but second half we were hanging on for dear life. I wish we had shown more of a killer instinct. 


Benteke is really impressing. Showed more this game than the past two in terms of his overall game, but he still has ways to go. I think he'll develop well. One thing that is underrated is when we clear it, he normally comes back and either plays it back or heads it to a teammate. Something neither Mario and Lambert had shown much ability to do. 

I thought Cou was brilliant. Two great shots and was creative all the time. Firmino looked rusty and out of fitness, but he's had a busy summer so he might take some time. I thought Milner was industrious. Helped in all phases and made the right play often than not. Can and Lucas, along with Milner, I thought really looked tidy in the midfield. Intercepted Arsenal possession, recycled it and started going forward again. It was really nice. I thought Gomez settled in and played decently. He still makes mistakes but for an 18 year old, he's not doing bad at all. Clyne was once again a boss down the right side. Really really tidy, was excellent going front and back.

If I suggested that there was any question of Lukaku's age, Danny Rose's age, or Aaron Lennon's age, then yeah, I'd agree with you that racism must be a factor in the question being raised.

[But there is a real issue in certain countries.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jamie-spencer/age-fraud-football_b_4856448.html)

&gt;According to Nigerian blogger George Onmonya, making players younger has never been easier: ""You can walk into any immigration office in Nigeria today, forge documents at the nearby business centre, change your name, place of birth, date of birth, pay 7,000-10,000 naira instead of the official price of about 5,500 for an international passport and within hours you have completed the whole process.""

&gt;Age fraud came to prominence in the Premier League from the mid 1990s onwards, as clubs began looking more and more at emerging African players. Several former Premier League players from Nigeria alone have been suspected of such misrepresentation.

Again, I don't think it's *likely* that Berahino is a case of age fraud, but I do hope that Tottenham is taking the question seriously and has done as much due diligence as is possible. I also don't know if Burundi is a country where age fraud would be relatively easy-- but given that transparency international has Burundi ranked as the 26th most corrupt country in the world, it seems quite feasible.

I really don't understand LVG, why not sell de gea instead of benching him, get 15M or whatever and use that money for a fast striker (this is what  I believe they need the most). 
If anyone is to compete with us for the title it has to be Chelsea, their defence is really shaky atm but their attack is superb, if they play like Liverpool in 2013/14 where they concede a lot of goals but they goal scoring tally out weighs it they should be good, look how much of a impact pedro made  in his first game and how well their attacking 4 communicates with each other, they do need to look at moving fabregas further up and play another cdm like that young guy they played at the end of the season.
Critics say arsenal are title contenders because they bought Cech but I am not convinced, mainly because like Chelsea they have a attacking mid in santi playing in a defensive role, even though santi is more reliable than fabregas I still see some vulnerability there in the midfield and coquelin is still learning as shown in the game against palace. Arsenal need to sort out their communication when it comes to defending, as shown in MOTD last night the city defence is always communicating to hold their line, for some reason at arsenal, mertasacker thinks he's usain bolt fast and will play way in front of the line believing that he will catch up to the attacker  if a ball was put over the top and ends up depending on koscienly or bellarin to make up for his error.

You clearly know your football, but it irks me a bit when people talk about rigid formations, which mean very little on their own, without bothering to go into any further depth.

&gt; When I say 3 central mids, I'm referring to the double pivot and the forward attacking mid as typically employed. I'm distinguishing between wide players and central players, not so much forward players and rearward players.

Gotcha. There is, however, a fundamental difference between an AM playing ahead of a double pivot and the CM who plays further forward in a midfield three. Eriksen for Ajax was the latter; with us, he's the former. Our 4-2-3-1 lends itself to a 4-4-2, as we've often played this season, because we're using a midfield duo.

&gt; Jesus's Benfica sounds interesting - if you've got any good online clips of this system or some tactical analysis to read on it, it'd be appreciated. I'm not sure I understand, though: 4 in the back, 2 in the pivot, a 10, a right wing and 2 strikers?

The link you posted from Zonal Marking is not quite it. That 2010 Benfica side was an absolute steamroller, but they relied a lot more on individual talent and Jesus has developed immensely as a manager since then. If you can find it, watch the first leg of our EL draw against them, and try to look past the Rod Stewart look-alike doing a weird little dance routine in Sherwood's face.

Chan, Coutinho, Benteke, Mignolet etc was also playing well. The only one who where not playing that well was Ibe.

My big question is who will be the one taking the last spot in the front 3, Benteke and Coutinho is a pretty much lock in right now as they are playing well. Lallana is injury prone, Ibe is lacking experience, Sturridge is injured and Firmino needs a couple of weeks.

This way you'd also not lose out on any interest and would be like it transferred as soon as you put pen to paper in the branch.

Although an electronic ISA transfer system was set up a couple of years ago, the guidance SLA of 14-15 days still applies so bank's will slack as much as possible.

The free-float value of Chinese markets—the amount available for trading—is just about a third of GDP, compared with more than 100% in developed economies. Less than 15% of household financial assets are invested in the stock market: which is why soaring shares did little to boost consumption and crashing prices will do little to hurt it. Many stocks were bought on debt, and the unwinding of these loans helps explain why the government has been unable to stop the rout. But this financing is not a systemic risk; it is just about 1.5% of total assets in the banking system"".* This is what the UK markets are reacting to, as a slowdown in China may be bad news for many companies based in the UK &amp; around the world. My take at least is that the markets are reacting to increased risks present at the moment, they don't know how the Communist Party is going to react (recent actions in the stock market is going against what they said previously about a more hands off free market approach), they don't know how the American Federal Reserve will react.

As long as you're smooth, and there's plenty of room between you and other vehicles [parked or otherwise], you can be on the right hand side of the lane as you enter. Look to get back to a dominant position as soon as you can, though.  
[Edit: Do *not* cut that corner though]

The centre of the lane isn't always the best place either, and that can show the examiner you have more skill too.  
For instance, if you're going down a road and there are parked cars on the *other* side of the road, it can often be an idea to move a bit over to the left, so oncoming vehicles can still get past.

Fucking pisses me off. My girlfriend suffers from quite a few of these conditions on the list here and while when they are not being a problem she is... able to cope within parameters which I am still learning myself. She can't deal with large crowds at the best of times, and changes to routine (a recently changed junction on her usual route into town was a recent trigger for this) can put her into panic attacks that will render her housebound at the least (and bedbound at worse) and it's fucking awful seeing her go through it. She's unemployable because the nature of the illness means she can't be guaranteed reliable. She just about runs an etsy store that might break even, so she has something to keep her active, but she has to apologise and cancel orders when she is particularly ill because she's, y'know, ill.

She had a relapse of some of her worse symptoms because of the stress of having a PIP assessment, she was so awfully terrified of losing what small ability she has (financially) to be able to get out of the house and do anything. She's at risk of losing her bus pass (also uses a wheelchair, I really picked a strange 'un to fall in love with) as well as she's apparently not physically disabled enough, but that just means she's gonna be stuck in the one fucking tiny town, unable to drive herself out of it and unable to afford to get a bus out of it either.

I'm hoping that whatever changes happen don't affect her financial independence as (apart from me being a student - soon - and totally unable to help there) - she doesn't *want* to be reliant on anyone in particular. She's not a charity case, and she doesn't want me to be in the position to emotionally abuse her either by being the source of her independence (bad previous experience, not me!). Her disability benefits are a way of her avoiding that situation, and... it's all just completely horrible to look at what might happen for her.

Edit: Whoops, I said bedbound at worst. I was wrong. Suicidal at worst. She lost her father to mental illness and so it's not an idle sort of use of the phrase.

It's like the state is trying to sanction the disabled into being even more disabled. I keep saying that more people would be considered physically disabled if the kerbs were 6 foot high, because it wouldn't just be wheelchair users who'd not be able to get up them, it'd be everyone. Disability is only a ""thing"" when the kerbs (literal or metaphorical) are too high for a subset of people to be unable to climb 'em.",null,0,null,1440452192,null,null,1440452968,0,cued1oy,null,t3_3i87gg,null,null,null,t1_cuebor1,null,null,null,1441448235,null,22,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

&gt; **Tuesday 3 February 1976**

&gt; The Constitutional Convention was reconvened in an attempt to reach agreement on a constitutional arrangement for Northern Ireland. A series of inter-party talks were held over the next three weeks and these were chaired by Robert Lowry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thursday 12 February 1976**

&gt; Talks between the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) broke down after only an hour. The UUUC would not agree on SDLP involvement in any future Northern Ireland cabinet. [This was a key element as far as Merlyn Rees, then Secretary of Sate for Northern Ireland, was concerned. The final meeting of the Convention took place on 3 March 1976. The British government brought the Convention to an end on 9 March 1976.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wednesday 3 March 1976**

&gt; A further meeting of the Constitutional Convention again called for the return of the Stormont government. The meeting ended in uproar and was to be the last meeting of the Covention. [The British Government brought the Convention to an end on 9 March 1976.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Tuesday 9 March 1976**

&gt; Merlyn Rees, then Secretary of State, announced the dissolution of the Constitutional Convention. ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/convention/chron.htm)

The actions of the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) were absurdly intransigent, the entire thing was a farce. They campaigned specifically against any mechanism that would allow powersharing:

&gt; **UNITED ULSTER UNIONIST COALITION MANIFESTO**

&gt; We see no reason for any special form of franchise for Northern Ireland different from that in use elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
&gt; 
&gt; However we are prepared to consider ways of giving to significant but scattered minorities representation which they would otherwise fail to achieve. A modification of the ""List system"" might be examined in this context, whereby most members would be elected for single member constituencies on a straight vote and the balance drawn from party lists in proportion to the votes cast. **We reject as inherently undemocratic any artificial device for giving any political party or interest a larger share of representation, influence or power than that to which its electoral support entitles it.** ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/uuuc/uuuc75man.htm)

This effectively meant a return to the old Stormont regime with little to no changes, which is why the talks broke down.

If an animal such as a husky is brought up to eat meat, where the hell does it learn the right or wrong not to kill sheep. Why does the dog have to be killed when its the owner at fault?

That part im pissed off is that an innocent animal is killed because the owner allowed the animal to be killed.. The animal did had no intention on harm, its just following guidenece or instinct yes it killed the sheep but under order, under guidance. The owner of the dog should be shot not the dog. 

The dog doesn't know what right or wrong. Its a dog not human. That's why im pissed off with both parties. That is why both the farmer and the owner are twats. An innocent animal under human behaviour has been killed because a sheep was killed. There should be laws for the owner to be fined/arrested/ whatever. But no, the animal has to suffer because of some both parties shitty human behaviour.

Animals have as much rights as humans do and people don't realise this. Sorry if this sounds like some pretentious animal lover, but it's the same for foxes or wolves or any animal for the matter of the fact.

It's unlikely that banks will be affected in the sense that there will be a huge number of write-offs and house repossessions, as this time round it isn't a housing issue, more likely investors losing money as a result.

House prices didn't plummet during the last recession but they did drop noticeabley - but since then they've recovered. Houses drop and rise in value all the time. The average in the long run is always positive.

Mortgages don't suddenly change in value - it is influenced by Bank of England base rate combined with a product you chose.

If a dog is doing something to actually warrant a ""warning shot"", then it actually deserves to be shot.   

Any kind of shot, warning or intended, will scatter sheep anyway. What that would do is turn an entire flock into ""prey"" in the mind of any attacking dog.  
They would also form a hazard to the shooting farmer as he might hit his own sheep, causing further harm than is necessary.  
The best chance of stopping it is as few shots as necessary to stop and kill the threat.

As pointed out by others, sheep are fragile animals anyway, easily miscarrying if frightened.

No, it doesn't. Under the Refugee Convention a state is allowed to lawfully remove asylum seekers to a safe third party country that an asylum seeker has passed through on the basis that they could have claimed asylum there, however the asylum seeker themselves is under no obligation to apply.

Once an asylum seeker has made a claim it must be determined by the state they are in, the only legal way to remove them is to temporarily move them to a third safe state whilst the claims are processed.

The other main rules for claiming asylum in the UK fall under the Dublin III Regulation sets out criteria for which state has the responsibility for examining an asylum claim, which includes such things as point of entry. But that has nothing to do with the claimant themselves, they do not have to abide by it, member states of the European Union (bar Denmark), Iceland, Switzerland, and Norway do, because they signed the Regulation.

The asylum seekers are not bound by any agreement signed by the state they are claiming in.

Are you kidding?  Minorities in Muslim majority nations often face enormous persecution.  Take the Ahmadis in Pakistan if you want an example.

[From Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ahmadis)

&gt;With 5 million Ahmadis [7][8] in Pakistan, persecution of Ahmadis has been particularly severe and systematic in Pakistan, which is the only state to have officially declared the Ahmadis non-Muslims.[9] Here they are prohibited by law from self-identifying as Muslims, and their freedom of religion has been curtailed by a series of ordinances, acts and constitutional amendments.[10] In applying for a Pakistani passport, Pakistanis are required to declare that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is an impostor prophet and that his followers are non-Muslims.[11]

Do you think Leicester City Council should boycott anything made in Pakistan?

null,null,backtowriting,null,null,null,"OK.  So, as to your question:

&gt;Anti-Zionism isn't the same thing as anti-Semitism.

Let's see what the article actually says:

&gt;The contemporary Left, in most cases, would recognise these statements as irrational prejudice. But what if we substituted ""Zionist"" for ""Jew"", what would happen then? How many would object to ""Zionists"" being termed enemies of the human race? How many would be glad to see the ""Zionist"" become impossible? Anti-Zionism has removed much of the need for classical anti-Semitism by recycling the old superstitions as a political critique of the State of Israel. Why risk the ridicule that comes with quoting The Protocols of the Elders of Zion when you can cite The Israel Lobby and win eager nods from academics and commentators? Why deny the Holocaust when you can throw it back in the Jews' faces by fictionalising Gaza as a concentration camp? Why hurl rocks at a Jew in the street when you can hurl endless vexatious UN resolutions at Israel?

So, to me, what this passage is claiming is that antisemites are dressing up their hatred with the cloak of anti-zionism.  And I think that's a fair criticism.  I'm not sure you could conclude from the above that the author thinks *all* criticisms of zionism are inherently antisemitic, but he certainly thinks that much of it is.

BTW - I don't have very strong opinions on this particular bit, and I think it distracts a little from the main topic - which is that Corbyn has associated with unambiguous antisemites and holocaust deniers.   For instance:

&gt;He invited Raed Salah, leader of the Islamic Movement, to tea on the Commons terrace. Salah promotes the blood libel that Jews murder children for blood to bake in their matzah and claims that thousands of Jews stayed home from work at the World Trade Centre on 9/11, a key component of the conspiracy theory that Jews and not Islamic fundamentalists were behind the attacks.

Now, that is *definitely* not just anti-zionism.  That is open racism against Jews.  Would you care to comment about that?",null,0,null,1440454466,null,null,false,0,cueefif,null,t3_3i74m8,null,null,null,t1_cuedyhu,null,null,null,1441448887,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

They make this snobbish and arrogant assumption that centrists are actually just fellow Trotskyites who have sacrificed their principles for ministerial cars in a moment of great cowardice and treachery. Heaven forbid that a centrist is actually just a principled person pursuing a different set of principles to yours.

And that's totally fine, but just form another party and go join them. As it is, middle class centrists with red rosettes just look like Oxbridge rejects from Exeter and UCL with chips on their shoulder, trying to get the poor vote so they can show those Old Money toffs from Oxford and Cambridge what's what. 

Liz Kendall doesn't care about the poor. And if she does then she should fire her entire staff because all I can see is her making pacts with the other two Stooges to beat Corbyn, or slinging mud around in an attempt to be the lucky one coming up smelling of roses. I haven't heard her say a thing about poor people and their needs, and that's HER problem, not mine. Poor people are just safe votes for her. And it's disgusting.

Labour haven't cared about poor people for 20 years, spending all their time in the Middle England battleground. ""We'll renationalise railways!"" They didn't. ""We'll put workers in boardrooms!"" They didn't.

I'd disagree with the author. I've met a fair number of people in the ME who are both openly anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist. But most people I know in the UK who are anti-Zionist aren't in the least bit anti-Semitic. Some of the more extreme ones are a bit naive and think that if the state of Israel disappeared the ME would be all kittens and rainbows. 

On the other side of the fence some Zionists intentionally conflate anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism in order to defuse criticism of Israel. 

&gt;Corbyn has associated with unambiguous antisemites and holocaust deniers. 

The depth of this association is unclear. There's so much bollocks being talked about Corbyn (both for and against) that it's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. Certainly Corbyn claims not to be anti-Semitic. He may think that it's more important to support the Palestinians than to oppose the anti-Semites. I don't yet know where the nuances are. 

Corbyn is against austerity, so for that reason I'm in favour of him.  There may or may not be some red flags elsewhere: there's plenty of time to investigate these before the next election.

null,null,cerrebro,null,null,null,"I feel I am well placed to answer this for you as my dissertation had a good 2 pages on touch screens. 

Touch screens mainly come in two types, capacitive and resistive. 

Capacitive: what you get on phones/tablets work by sensing a change in the screens electrostatic field that is caused by a finger on the screen. As such these touchscreens only require a very light touch to work. However these screens have problems sensing touches if any kind of liquid is present on the screen. 

Resistive touchscreen: what you see in this video and what was on a lot of touchscreen phones around the time of the first iPhone. These screens work via pressure. When you finger touches the screen, a top layer touches the bottom layer and this registers as a touch. These screens are better in high single use environments as they still work when liquids or containments are on the screen. Hence why they are used on ticket machines because if someone covered a screen in say chocolate, the resistive screen would still work fine for the next user while a capacitive screen would probably need cleaning 

Edit: also you can still use a resistive screen while wearing gloves, you can't with a capacitive unless the fingertip of the glove is made from a special material. And resistive screens are cheaper.

Democracy is about managing plurality and finding a workable and fair way to achieve stable government that respects the vast diversity of individual opinion that can exist in any given society or entity.. but all the same still permits a way ahead to be taken.

It's becoming clearer by the day as more and more evidence comes in that he has indeed cozied up to people with bigoted views.  Honestly, I think that the only reason his supporters can dispute this is because they're allowing themselves to ignore disconfirming evidence.  But this story is not going to go away.  It's just going to get bigger and bigger as time goes by.

&gt;Certainly Corbyn claims not to be anti-Semitic.

Well, this is part of the point of the article.  He may well not be an antisemite himself, but he has allowed himself to associate with an astonishing array of people who are antisemitic.  And that by itself should be cause for concern.

We're talking about someone who's about to become the leader of a major political party, and as such, I don't think his supporters can get away with claiming that it wasn't a priority for him to investigate the racist views of his associates.

&gt;Corbyn is against austerity, so for that reason I'm in favour of him.

I sympathize, but I think that you're supporting someone who's never going to be in an effective position to do anything about austerity.  He's unelectable and his past is going to catch up with him.

&gt;There may or may not be some red flags elsewhere: there's plenty of time to investigate these before the next election.

Unless Corbyn is very astute I think he's doomed. Not so much because of association with anti-Semites but more because of stuff like his support for a transaction tax and his failure to denounce PIRA. The former will alienate donors and the latter will piss off voters. 

But the Labour party is woefully short of talent at the moment. All the other credible candidates are either pro-austerity or Blairites. So either we have a party with a potentially unelectable leader, or we have just another centre-right party with unpleasant authoritarian tendencies.

Spectators on the other hand should not be put in danger, and if what they are watching puts them in danger then that's something that should be fixed.

* Why are the transfers sub par? What makes you think that?    I agree we are somewhat dull up front, but we have been missing 3 very important creative players from the team due to injury or them not even being with the team yet. Give it time.

Jesus fuck. Concentrated shite. You've not won me over. 

A lot of the women on that list of yours are recognisable faces to me, and they're okay. But they don't rank anywhere close to the level of male comedians. If they were male, they likely wouldn't be as famous. 

&gt;If you can't be arsed to go and see proper standup instead of the shit that's spoonfed to you on TV you have no fucking right to start making pronouncements about female comics.

I go see a lot of live stand up, actually. The conclusion I've come to is that if there's a woman on the rota I need to get a few more beers in beforehand. 

&gt;but none of them make it anywhere near TV because of the near-universal misconception that ""women just aren't funny"".

The BBC now has comedienne quotas, and yet 9 times out of 10 the women they get on are comedy black holes..

&gt;All the other candidates are either pro-austerity or Blairites. So either we have a party with a potentially unelectable leader, or we have just another centre-right party with unpleasant authoritarian tendencies. 

OK, you want someone who's not a centrist.  But, it's centrists who win elections.  If Corbyn doesn't get elected, then what have his supporters achieved?  They're going to turn the UK into a one party state - in which the Conservatives get to do what they want without any effective opposition.  Is that really what you want?

This is already getting off-topic, but I think there's a *real* danger when people push for ideological purity over pragmatism.  And the Corbynist left are anything but pragmatic.  

Even if Corbyn did become PM, I doubt he'd be any good.  He's an old-time Marxist lefty.  And I'm skeptical that this type of ideology can ever be made to work in practice.  I know that it sounds nice on paper, but I'm not sure that the hard-left have *ever* managed to successfully run a country without driving the economy into the ground.  They're just too ideological.

null,null,faghat,eng-yorkshire,North Yorkshire,null,"&gt; Comparing an air show pilot to driving a car is a non-argument. Think of them more like people who do extreme sports; there is a very real and inherent risk of injury or death, yet they willingly assume that risk. 

Totally agree, and obviously the two aren't directly comparable, but the logic is still sound, imo.

I took up skydiving last year and the risk of death is extremely low - mostly because of how strict the regulations are. I wouldn't feel safe if it weren't for all the regulations on canopy (packing), flight regulations, jumping etc.  
I realise, as with any thing in life, yeah of course there's a risk of dying. But I don't expect to die, because of how small the risk is. I'm safer up in the air than I am driving a car on the road.

&gt;Spectators on the other hand should not be put in danger, and if what they are watching puts them in danger then that's something that should be fixed. 

And the poor people that died, they weren't even spectators. People willingly spectating an air show accept the risks involved, but not those driving past on their way to work, etc.

&gt;The statistics though prove that air displays are not one of those things...it's been 64 years since the last spectator fatality. This was a freak accident, nothing more.

No, you're not in a position to speculate on this. The AAIB are investigating just quite what the fuck happened, and the CAA will act on what they find. 

No further flights are to be made by Hawker Hunter aircraft as a **precaution**. This is a temporary measure until people make heads or tails of this thing. Similarly, vintage jet displays over land have not *permanently* been banned. Nothing has yet been set in stone, as this message (included in the same CAA announcement BBC News is pulling this story from ) clearly states: *""Further details will be provided in the coming days and we will continue to work with the industry to ensure the most appropriate action is taken as a result of this review.""*

&gt;No. Air displays are incredibly regulated already, and the statistic reflect it. 

And there was just a **massive** spike in the statistics... The number of accidents are so low just because of regulations like these.

* This time yesterday: I'd take a draw. Happily.
 
55 Minutes before kickoff: We can win this.

30th minute: I'll be annoyed if we don't win this.

Half-time: I'll be *pissed* if we don't win this.

70th minute: I'll take a draw.

Full-time: I still don't know.

That's a game we should be happy to draw but we could have won it and we should have won it but we could have lost it and we got a draw which is good but I'm not happy. Football!

* Gomez was okay in the first half, struggled a bit with the movement (understandable and expected) but did okay. He was very good in the second half. Growing to love the kid.

* Gaaaaaaah Cech. Why? I said last season he was probably still the 3rd best keeper in the league and now he's at Arsenal probably still being the 3rd best keeper in the league. Fuck. 

* Migs did okay but it's a credit to the defence that he can't come away with as much credit as Cech - he did everything he needed to do but wasn't pushed to be at his best. Good Arsenal play didn't translate into many good Arsenal chances. Mignolet still hasn't *had* to be at his best yet this season - again, defence points.

* Defence! Actual shape, organisation, nullification of threats? What am I watching? We're Liverpool, we're supposed to draw that game 2-2, not 0-0. Best defensive performance since Southampton last season, which was arguably the best all-round defensive display we've put in during Rodgers' tenure (and really, since Rafa). It's one thing with 3/5 at the back getting in the opposition's way, this was genuinely very good defending, and I'm enough of an elitist football snob to rarely acknowledge that. Rodgers is at his best when he tempers his ideals to the realities of football (including that Arsenal will play great football when they have possession high up) and he did so today; Brendan, O'Driscoll, Pepin and Gary Mac all deserve credit.

* Dejan Lovren. Usually just typing that is enough to make my cock bleed, but this might actually have been his best display in a Liverpool shirt. And I'm not even saying that as one of those ""damning with faint praise"" things, he was very good today. One first half mistake aside (because I keep track of these things, that scramble in the box where neither he nor Skrtel wanted to clear the ball) he actually looked like a good defender today. Usually he looks good on the ball and a horror show off it, but this was the first game where I've seen his positioning, organisation and defensive movement in the second half completely overshadow his distribution, one-touch clearances and general comfort on the ball. I've said before he looks like a talented defender who's never had a day of training in his life; Sean O'Driscoll must have been tutoring him this week, because he looked like the defender we hoped he'd be. If this carries on I might have to pour Noflan on my effigy. 

* Coutinho is such a motherfucker of a player. He just runs games, sees moves developing, turns players in circles and hits weaknesses. He's not quite where he can be yet, but don't let anyone kid you - any team in England would love him, and most teams in Europe. Barcelona are going to buy him in a year or two and I'll cry and cry and cry. 

* Firmino looked good, if still a bit rusty and not totally in tune with his teammates. I'm a Firmino fanboy so excuse my gushing, but he showed in flashes that he's a perfect player for us; that transition between tackle and dribble he showed so well in Germany was on display today, and the flashes of class will become more frequent as he settles.

*Bellerin and Ozil were fairly anonymous today. 

* [Ramsey's goal was a goal.](https://vine.co/v/eJOqlxDOUq6)

* Still not entirely sold on Benteke as being our top choice, but he's definitely shown some strengths I didn't expect of him. His hold-up play is much better than I anticipated (beyond winning the ball, he seemed to lose it too often after for Villa and Belgium - glad to see he's been excellent with it for us) and his movement is better than I though too, albeit still a bit slow. I expected him to be a decent-but-not-great signing for us, he's at least on track to prove me wrong. Sturridge did, I really hope I'll be made to look a fool again. 

* There's very little to say about Clyne because he's always close to flawless. It's getting boring.

* Rossiter coming on was a good sign for Arsenal. Rossiter helping keep a clean sheet was a great sign for us. Early signs point to him getting minutes deputising for Milner and Hendo. 

* Tricky set-piece routines are fun. Stop doing them, please.

* I've been vocal about saying we should upgrade on Lucas; once again, he proves his worth without entirely proving that he can't be improved upon. Whatever criticisms I have about his play, his attitude and focus have been as good as anyone I've ever seen at the club. I so want him to prove my every criticism wrong. 

* I'm too drunk to continue.

I'm not speculating about anything. ""Freak accident"" means statistically improbable or highly unlikely, which it most certainly is. It speaks nothing to the cause of the accident, which hasn't been established; only the likelihood of the accident, which is exceedingly low.

On the topic of speculating though, as a military pilot myself, I am in a reasonable position to ""speculate"" that the video very clearly shows pilot error; he misjudged the loop and flew a perfectly good airplane into the ground. 

It's happened before, note how the below videos are all practically identical to the crash we are discussing.

&gt;And there was just a massive spike in the statistics... The number of accidents are so low just because of regulations like these. I don't understand why everyone is outraged by this.

Labour HAD to spend extra money to prop up the “too big to fail” banks in order to try and limit financial contagion and calm our own markets during the 2008 financial crisis, so of course there wouldn't have been a lot of money left over to spend on public services. Even Alistair Darling (the chancellor at the time) knew during this period that cuts would have to be made to public services, but he also knew that if he accelerated the rate of cuts, it would have been counter productive and wouldn't have helped to stimulate the economy. The Tories didn't take this on board straight away, only instead of eventually providing more money for welfare and public services when things started to look up, they shifted money more towards businesses, corporate welfare style. The government can try to prop up things like British retailers (the ones that rely on British consumers) all they like, but without consumers having much spending power and not receiving a bit of a leg up from the government until they are ready to stand on their own two feet, this won't help retailers in deprived areas very much if they don't get enough customers, the ones they do get don't always have a lot of money to spend. These retailers will get generous grants from the government to prop them up so they can stay in business a bit longer, they just won't always get the customers (except for places like pound shops). It is possible for the government to solve this problem by making sure that both the public (public services and those on welfare) and businesses get an equal share of the public money that's available (roughly one half would go to businesses, the other half would go towards welfare and public services) in order to ensure a more even economic recovery that benefits as many people as possible, but they choose not to because of their irrational drive to stick to their current economic and social ideology. 

If you want more information, I would recommend these two articles:

Years ago I used to believe the Daily Mail's exaggerations about Labour's supposedly negative impact on the economy with their spending, not anymore.

null,null,al_qeal_yall,null,null,null,"Hi OP,

So I did some light digging and here's what I've found. The company seems to actually exist, and based on the website you've given, they do seem to at least have the appearance of a professional organisation (although their annual accounts are overdue as of last week).

They give information on the founder, whose credentials seem to check out (apparently she is well enough known in the China/UK promotions circle, and there are actually BBC interviews with her on the web). 

They also have a page where they post quotes/testimonials from people who work in careers offices of various UK universities, and I have checked their titles/names against LinkedIn and there seem to be no discrepancies either.

Finally, I can confirm that their Chinese language website is also of a decent standard, although it doesn't seem to have been updated as regularly as you'd expect for this type of organisation.

All of this doesn't confirm the legitimacy of their business, however there doesn't seem to be anything big suggesting an overt scam. Though of course, nobody thought Bernie Madoff was running a pyramid scheme until the very end either.

To answer your two questions:

1) There is not enough info to be gleamed from two phone screenshots to be able to confirm or deny if they are legitimate transactions. The references shown (MC BGC) are defined by the sender, and not the bank; so as you say, it is possible that she made the transfer herself, between her own accounts. In fact, there is nothing to say she didn't just get a screenshot of a generic Barclay's transfer and edit the numbers/references herself (many image editing tools online can do this easily, in fact looking at it, it's simple enough to do even in Paint).

2) If it is genuine, it is far from obvious that the company paid her without the required UK tax. In fact, *if it is genuine*, one would have to assume that the organisation is also genuine, and judging by their website/online record, they seem to be at least professional enough to assume that they would have paid the relevant taxes (presume you are talking about NI and income tax, which would be deducted pre-payment). Alternatively, she could be working as a self employed freelance agent, in which case it would be her own responsibility to pay tax on the money at the end of the tax year (Self Assessment). In fact, unless you have more data that you have not shared here, you would have trouble justifying the allegation that they are not paying taxes.

Having said that, if you do have more information which does suggest they are not paying the correct taxes, reporting them is certainly one avenue you could pursue.

So what are the conclusions? There simply is not enough information/evidence in your post to confirm or deny that they are doing anything illegal. But that doesn't mean that you should trust them, or let your SO sign up with them in any significant capacity until you have found more information about them.

Here are some suggestions to things you could look into:

1. They have listed offices in London, NY and Manchester on their website. The NY and Manchester ones are in serviced office buildings, which you could easily contact to confirm if they do indeed occupy premises there, and for how long.

2. On their website, they give quotations from people working in the careers offices of several established UK universities, most of whom have public contact details (work email address and work phone number). Contact them or their university careers offices to confirm their interactions with this company, and ask them what their impressions were.

3. Call their office and ask them questions. The best way to gauge this would be to speak to them directly. Do not give them any personal information, and if they are a genuine business they should be happy to tell you more about what they do, and how they can benefit you. Ask yourself if their answers make sense.

4. Talk to the ""girl in question"". It's far from clear what her ""payments"" are for, and what exactly her job role is. On the one hand, don't go into this presuming that she is running an illegal scheme, but on the other hand don't be afraid to ask direct and clear questions either.

5. Do not sign any documents which commit yourself / your SO to any liability / responsibility towards them. Most importantly, exercise great caution if at any stage they ask for a ""commitment"" or ""investment"" towards them in the form of money or otherwise.

null,null,Galerath,null,null,null,"Hmmm, it's difficult. The problem is that changing a culture is not an easy thing, and it's the culture that does have to change - no use splurging money on education if they don't *want* to learn. And when it comes to changing culture, people have to be willing to change, you cannot force it on them without totalitarian government. In a democracy (or a ""democracy"" such as ours is...), the only options that are usually deployed are incentives and disincentives. The idea being to make it attractive to them to *stop being the underclass*.

The Conservative solution is of course to go after the benefits and ""force"" them to work rather than live off welfare. I doubt this works at all. America for example has its own underclasses both in terms of the ghettoized black population and the southern Rednecks. Neither has changed as a result of the positively hostile government culture with practically zero handouts; rather the disincentive approach has entrenched them. I suspect similar will happen here now.

The Labour solution has mostly been in terms of community projects and big government spending. And they've basically spent a whole lot of money and achieved... pretty much next to nothing.

Neither solution works and as a result [social mobility is largely a myth](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/is-social-mobility-a-myth/) (Yes it's the American Conservative, but it's a bloody good read). Neither the American system nor intensive Scandinavian welfare states seem to budge people from their respective classes. 

The only thing that did give people a livelihood was good old fashioned Socialism via socialised industry... but it was also enormously inefficient and a result of over reliance on it, Britain was pretty much bankrupted. In other words, the local results were good, national results... not so good. 

I cannot really see a pragmatic compromise: we could try having *some* nationalised industry, but I suspect it would just end up effectively a social dumping ground where the undesirables do pointless work for pointless pay while still having no real prospects beyond working at a Government whatever factory.

But perhaps that's preferable to the present situation. 

The Utilitarian in me says that we should at least have decent welfare and let them have an ok life, even if they are just going to sit on their arses and be useless. We *can* afford to carry these people, and I'd rather they didn't live in abject poverty.

Now, I want him to go to Inter. I want him to play in his proper position, as a playmaker and a 10. He isn't Bale, he only played inverted at Roma because of Totti, who is quoted as saying Lamela is his *heir*. He's a RW playmaker who drifts inside, and scored 13 of his 15 goals in the box. But lets ignore that, and keep trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.

Just like we ''ruined'' everyone else. It's their problem as players personally isn't it; they lose their ability because of the big bad EPL, not us and our setup on the field. Even though this happens time and time again, it's the players fault. So lets bring in another talent, and see how that pans out. Oh wait, we won't. So we have Eriksen (injured atm, could be injured anytime), Pritchard (unproven, but high hopes) and wait...who else is creative and has that spark, can slot straight in and will leave their clubs in the next 2 weeks?

Unless we're going for Wingers, and keeping Eriksen as our 10, with Prichard as backup, but other AMC targets? Or, rush Marcus Edwards to the First Team ASAP. That kid is special. So so special.

And I don't claim to, I'm merely speculating, based on personal experience and the facts we know so far.

&gt;The regulations were working fine for 60 odd years until now. Almost 10 people have died because of it - that's the evidence. 

The regulations still work, and if holes are found that can increase safety, great. An isolated incident (which this truly is) isn't proof that regulations don't work, there is always a remote chance that something may go wrong. It certainly doesn't preclude change, but it's rash to make such sweeping rules without the any real evidence of what the problem was in the first place. This is caving the public pressure, plain and simple.

In aviation, most accidents can be explained by the ""[swiss cheese model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model)"". Basically each slice of cheese represents a layer of precaution, safety systems, regulations and procedure. No system is perfect though, and there are holes in each layer. Almost always, potential accidents are prevented by one of the layers, but that one time in a million, the holes simply line up and the worst happens.

null,null,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"We made those substitutions because our game plan was clearly to hit hard in the first half and try to get some goals and contain the second. 

We pressed so hard in the first half and played such a high tempo game, you can't really sustain it. 

To me it was a great strategy by Brendan today. The Emirates is a tough, tough place to get a result. Arsenal are fragile mentally and can be far too casual, but once they get in a rhythm they can truly be spectacular. Rodgers decided that we needed to hit them hard and fast, especially with their defensive duo gone. Don't allow them to get a rhythm.

It worked, we could have been 3-1 up if not for Cech going god mode, we were the dominant team. Unfortunately we didn't get the goals, so the next half we had to sacrifice a lot of territory and actually did a fantastic job of limiting their chances. 

The subs? Completely rational. I disagree with you entirely they were bad. 

Firmino and Lucas were looking fatigued and they were replaced like for like. We aren't blessed with a multitude of options other than youth, and Ibe really should have made more of an impact than he did. 

Ibe hasn't played well in his first two games, but he is fast, can beat players and we know he can finish from his loan spells. It's rational to me that he was subbed on while we were sat deep with our only chance of scoring would be on a counter to have someone as direct and capable as Ibe. Unfortunately he had a shocker, not easy for a manager to call that coming. 

Rossiter did *okay*. He really needs to buff up, far too weak, but he is a holding player, and didn't make any proper mistakes, so subbing him on for a fatigued Lucas is fine. 

I agree with the subs made as we should have been closing up shop in the second half. To still try to win while having applied ourselves so hard in the first half would have been moronic. We would have been torn apart and likely would have lost. A point at the emirates is a good result, and it was managed the right way by Brendan.

Edit: Seems weird people having to read up about Bale. I still remember him being at Southampton being hot shit for the future as a 16 year old left back who was mint at free kicks. He did some interview where he said he wasn't allowed to use his strong foot when playing in PE at school growing up because he would just make a fool of everyone.

null,null,rappersdo,,These days if you say you support Corbyn...,null,"The 'New Labour' formula was what drove voters away in droves, look at England Vs Scotland. In England Miliband distanced himself from New Labour, had actual grassroots campaigning and increased Labour's share of the vote(should've done better but still). In Scotland they had a Blairite leadership with little/no grassroots campaigning. 

What you described is what's turning people away from the Labour party, people don't want small c conservatism sold to them in the form of the choice of 'Labour I suppose.' 

Labour showed they were out of touch on the EU by not even entertaining the debate, when in fact there's still a section of the left that is still anti-EU.

The Greens are not a socialist pressure group, they're an environmentalist(emphasis on the mental) group that people vote for out of protest. 

I'm glad you can predict 5 years into the future and see exactly what's going to happen. 

This Tory government hasn't even got started yet and there will be a lot of resentment and anger towards them in 5 years time. The horror stories about the disabled and those on benefits will only get worse.

Honestly I don't think any of the 4 candidates could win an election, Corbyn would get Labour on the right track and hold a leadership election in 2018, he's said he'll do this so that's the best reason to have him in charge.

That half-hour where we dominated possession and created chance after chance? Coutinho was the architect, Hendo and Milner were the engine and Benteke was the benefactor, but Ibe helped it all to happen by being fast, strong and dangerous. Sometimes it doesn't matter how good he is, it's the glimpses of how good he can be that can have an effect; that combination of pace and power pushed Bournemouth back 10-15 yards and allowed us to spread out and control the game further up the pitch. It's pretty sensible to put him in on a situation where we're pinned back, because in theory he can help to alleviate that and break the opponents' defence. Moreno did a bit of that last week too, and Markovic did that unheralded job many times last season (and I wish he was on hand today, hopefully he'll get the chance soon). Ibe isn't in the best form, but in the absence of other players in form at the moment and any control of possession, bringing him on made a lot of sense. Same with Moreno.

Obviously he offers significantly more defensively than Ings would have, but it felt like Ibe's addition ultimately hurt the team where Ings would have given us more of a chance to score, but I concede that that wasn't the strategy as the game was coming to a close, as our aim was clearly to hang on for the point.

As we didn't really have another option for Lucas, Rossiter makes sense and turned out alright so I guess it's tough to complain there. But personally I probably would have liked a compromise where Firmino comes off for Moreno, Coutinho stays on and both Ings and Ibe remain on the bench.

The key for me lies in those bank statements, especially in the references given: MC BCG &amp; MC SALARY BCG. 

First it's unlikely for the wages dept. of any company to change references like that, or at least the part they can dictate. 

Second BGC stands for Bank Giro Credit which was the manual system that preceded BACS, the current electronic transfer system. It's unusual for a company to pay wages via a BGC slip at a branch counter.

Third MC stands for Mastercard.

So both these payments were made at a counter by credit card, unusual for a larger firm especially one which has a barrister as one of the directors. Of course the entire credit limit of a card can be used without attracting interest if it's repaid before the end of the billing period. It's a form of churning. 

I'd suggest approaching the company and asking if this young lady does indeed work on their behalf.

A couple of potentially significant details left out of the Telegraph's version:

&gt; Tundra was playing in long grass when he “took off” across the meadow and crossed a boundary into neighbouring farmland. After a two-hour search of the area, Dr Nurmsoo says she heard and smelled a gunshot.

&gt; “I’m not arguing that he shouldn’t have been on the lookout. I’m not excusing Tundra’s actions. But if he’d shot over the top of his head it would have startled him and he would have stopped.”

&gt;  Mr Jordan ... put signs on the boundaries of his property, warning that trespassing dogs ran the risk of being shot. But these have since been ripped down, he says, possibly by dog walkers angered by the warnings.

&gt; “That sheep would have died a slow, agonising death. In comparison, the dog’s was quick and painless.”

So the dog was gone for two hours before it was shot. This was not an excited little puppy that got distracted, this was an untrained dog running essentially wild. The owner does not disagree with the farmer's actions, but is rather suggesting that a warning shot would have been effective.

The farmer put up warning signs, though who took them down is a matter of speculation. And if we're talking purely animal welfare, he was choosing between one humane animal death and potentially multiple inhumane deaths.

Furthermore (included in the Telegraph article):

&gt; He said: ""That dog was attacking my sheep *and anyone who tried to stop him.*"" [emphasis added]

This suggests that the farmer did try to stop the dog without shooting it, failed, got attacked for his trouble, and acted not only in defence of his property but also of himself - though that's reading quite a lot into one quote.

Just one added thought. The suggestion that a warning shot would have been effective implies that the warning shot would have not only scared the dog away, but also sent it back to its owner. The dog had already been running free for two hours. There was no reason to think - nor for the farmer to believe - that a dog that was already a known sheep-killer, was actively worrying his sheep, and that had ignored its owner's calls for two hours, would not remain in the vicinity and continue to threaten the sheep.",null,0,null,1440471987,null,null,false,0,cueopie,null,t3_3i7jox,null,null,null,t1_cue00zw,null,null,null,1441453795,null,25,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25,null

We first meet Wilf Christmas Day, 2007. Just slightly over 66 years after the London Blitz.

Wilf looks to be in his mid to late 60's in Voyage of the Damned. Which means he was likely born around the end of the Blitz and dead in the middle of WW2. The man in this picture, is in my most humble opinion not an infant. In fact he appears to be about 40. Even if the man was 30 (Which he does not look), that would mean Wilf is 96 years old in 2007.

Also he really doesn't look anything like Bernard Cribbins, who would also have had a significantly bigger role considering that he is a very respected actor.

I don't think it is naive to expect a different performance. We know he is capable of more, and having him come on late against tired legs and less people marking him as they're pressing for a winner is a huge difference to starting with defenders doubling up on you. 

Part of his poor performances in the previous two games have come from the opposition focusing on shutting him down by putting 2 players against him. 

Today he in theory should have had more breathing room and chances to run at defense not so focused on keeping him quiet. 

It's on Ibe for me, not Rodgers. I thought Ibe was a good sub who didn't perform to the level he should have done. Hopefully he can kick on in the future.

Labour's landslide had more to do with the Tories being shit, Blair promising to get rid of the sleaze and most importantly, the left wing policies he promised and failed to deliver on. He promised renationalisation of the railways, an end to NHS internal markets and workers in boardrooms in his 97 manifesto. What we got was the same shit railways, *acceleration* in internal markets and creeping privatisation of the NHS &amp; he kept Thatcher's anti-trade unions laws which he described as 'The most restrictive trade union laws in Europe.

Blair and New Labour won elections but they did so at a cost of the core of the party's support. The concessions the Blairites want to make now are too much for anyone but the most tribal of members to stomach, with acceptance of private sector involvement in the NHS and pro-Israel polices, they are making sacrifices for the sake of sacrifices.

Similar to Eriksen in that respect. He has a great range of passing and vision, with an eye for a through ball and key passes from CM. 

On top that he seems way more experienced than 22, and he's pretty combatative and has a good tackle on him. He can do a bit of everything, but a bit of everything REALLY well (like a...better, Dutch Jenas with more defensive skill). I would absolutely love us to sign him; but I feel bad for Ajax in the same way our players get poached, and he's happy there. But we should be all over Klaassen, imo. 

Veltman is another, but he's a CB, and would have no intention of being a backup with Jan, Toby, Wimmer if Dier sticks at DM. We also have Vickers and Milos to come through too. But he's had an incredible start in Ajax's first 3 games, all wins.

Depending on your parking situation you might find that access to a tap to clean your bike is difficult so a small handheld pressure sprayer can be really useful for rinsing your bike off. You can just fill the tank up from a regular tap and then carry it to your bike and even just a quick 2 minute rinse should help get the worst of the salt off it. You can add warm water and a car shampoo to the tank or just use plain water and if you remember to you can fill the washer before you leave in the morning so it's less of a hassle at the end of the day.

Another thing to consider might be heated grips if you are worried about the cold. Although I don't commute on my bike anymore I ride year round and have found that heated grips have really made a difference to my comfort levels on colder days, especially as I dislike the bulky feel of the heavily insulated gloves. You could still use them in conjunction with bar muffs to keep the wind off too. You can get wrap around ones which just velcro around your existing grips but I'd really recommend fitting the ones which replace your existing grips - they are easy to fit and work very well. Some models will require you to wire them into a switched live feed (necessary so that you don't leave them on and come back to a flat battery!) but the Oxford premium models have a sensor in them which will turn them off if the ignition is off too which makes wiring them in a case of just attaching a cable to each battery terminal. The ones I use are:

null,null,RifleEyez,null,null,null,"&gt;The only touches I've ever seen Lamela make in the box for Spurs are those separate slide shots that fly into the stands 30 rows up.

Ironically, 13 of Lamelas 15 goals came *inside the box* at Roma. So it's funny you say that; I mean, I'm sure the reason why he managed that is because the defenders in ITALY are so sub par compared to the Premier League. It's confidence, but I go into that. 

Anyway, I don't mean this as a sarcastic post, so don't take it that way. 

First, Dempsey was during Lamelas first season, most of which he spent out through injury. He came to the club injured IIRC and it got past the medical. Adapting too, so I'm writing that one off.

Chadli, no. He isn't pacey at all. Nor is Dembele, who is our ''RW experiment''. The entire team lacks pace, which makes it easy to defend against. Especially with 11 men behind the ball. We all know this, it's a *team* issue, hence the signings we're looking at Berahino and the ones we bought in Njie.

You can single Lamela out, fine. But regardless of who we play, the same argument arises 'we lack intent' 'passing mindlessly' 'no real threat attacking', you know the types of comments we get time and time again in match threads. So again, that suggests a team issue, and not just the fact Lamela exists somewhere in the world which means we look toothless without him on the pitch for spells, right? 

Lamela doesn't just 'lose' his talent - he hasn't, that's obvious in the little touches, feints and times he lets the ball run across him to beat a man, for example. I watched him close vs Leicester, mainly cuz I made a huge post on him, and he played decently but had no real options half the time to even attempt to excel. 

It's just confidence that's shot and the fact he's just played in the wrong position, never given consistent time at AMC (I get that, Eriksen) with the wrong setup (wings) around him. He's a 10, a playmaker, he isn't a 'Bale-esque' player. He's arguably, bar Eriksen (and you could include maybe potentially another 1 or 2) the most creative player we have. His vision is fantastic, and when he sets of through the *centre*, with players actually making runs with pace - he's formidable. I could pull up dozens upon dozens of examples of this; hell, lots of them in games he played with us where allegedly he was 'bad'. 

Eriksen is more of a take on a player out wide style of player than than Lamela is, which isn't what Eriksen is best at and you think of Eriksen as being the 10, and Lamela as the inverted winger.

What's important is that you can demonstrate (1) that you know what you're getting into and (2) that you have a genuine interest in the subject. Seems like you maybe have the economic's bit down, though I'd recommend doing some maths if you can (based on my friends' experiences doing PPE, quantitive econ can be rough). Just keep doing research into the management bit so you can at least speak to why you find it interesting.

It's still taught throughout school though, and natives of Bath (particularly the older ones) have a tendency to drift in an out of Latin whilst speaking to you.

A sizeable number of people in Bath still adhere to the Roman religion - I believe it was something like 10% in the last census, but I'll have to check later as I'm on my phone. The belief is still strong enough that Walt Disney's *Hercules* was banned in Bath for it's portrayal of the Greek/Roman gods as blundering fools.

* Firmino is not completely match fit. The choices to replace him would have been Origi, Ings or Ibe. In a match this critical, it would have been foolish to sub either Origi or Ings because at the point the sub happened, we were sitting back - content to counter, but more focused on containing Arsenal. Ibe in the past has shown an ability to track back as well as counter at pace. Origi &amp; Ings have proven neither in a red shirt in the PL. So the switch made absolute sense given the other proven option on the bench. It just happened that Ibe had a shite game. This might lead to others like Origi or Markovic to have more of a run in future fixtures. But the fact remains that Ibe playing shite doesn't make his sub a wrong decision. 


* Lucas was completely gassed. Our bench featured Rossiter, Origi, Moreno, Ibe, Ings, Bogdan and Sakho. Hendo, Allen &amp; Lallana - all would have obviously started ahead of Rossiter - all out injured.  There were only two likely subs for Lucas, who was always going to be subbed: Rossiter assuming the game was reasonably poised, or Sakho if we were hemorrhaging goals. So it really wasn't a surprise that Rossiter came on for Lucas. 

* Coutinho - we need to preserve this little sex-pot of a magician. We can't afford him to be last year's Sterling and burn out either physically or mentally. At the point where he was subbed, we were rightly going for a draw I think, so Moreno made sense because he'd be bomb forward while helping out Gomez.

Cos them's the rules. Anyone who is a UK, Irish, or Commonwealth citizen (either by birth or naturalisation) is permitted to become an MP.

&gt; Can an English [British] person come to Ireland and run as a TD?

No. Ireland has different rules and only citizens of the country can be TDs.

I don't why each country has the rules it does, but  I can hazard a guess. The UK's rules were likely established following the end of the Second World War and the collapse of the British Empire. Quite large numbers of upper-class British citizens elected to remain in the newly-independent now-Commonwealth countries where they'd been born and grown up, and I suspect that their friends in government wanted to ensure that they weren't disenfranchised from standing as MPs if they wanted to.

Ireland on the other hand has a real, written, constitution document, and much of it was written in such a way as to emphasise the new country's difference from the UK which it had fought so hard to gain independence from. So it was probably a deliberate conscious requirement to say that all TDs must be Irish citizens (in the early 1920s it also probably helped stop British citizens coming over to stand and trying to take back the country by ""stealth"").",null,0,null,1440483863,null,null,false,0,cueto23,null,t3_3ia87h,null,null,null,t3_3ia87h,null,null,null,1441456197,null,8,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8,null

Now before you go off accusing me of being racist the reasoning for this is simple, these groups don't stand a chance on their own. That's just reality, we saw it with the Yazidi being attacked by ISIS, they can't hope to really defend themselves just because of sheer numbers. If you read the stories of girls, *children*, taken and forced into sexual slavery they often report it wasn't just ISIS doing it but it was their sunni neighbors as well.

I think we should be funneling large amounts of materiel, support and training to the YPG/J in Syria as they have shown themselves to be one of the few moderate groups we can rely on and the only one with the chops to really take on ISIS. I know the Kurds aren't perfect, and have their own problems like a high instance of FGM, but we have to find partners we can work with. 

We should then set up a relocation program inside of Rojava (YPG/J area) to start assessing and bring the persecuted minorities to Europe. This allows us to really filter as best as we can potential Trojan horses, allows us to start intervening and helping these families from day one so they don't end up homeless in Calais, and allows us to educate the community about dealing with the horrific things that have gone on.

I urge everyone to go and read the stories published about Yazidi girls and their communities and families.

null,null,kopking08,null,null,null,"I don't know. Wasn't it a recent year that we actually handled all the lower league teams and couldn't beat a team in the top 7 or something for a long stretch of time? I think it's a bit of a cliche to say we perform better against better teams and worse against worse. It just so happens that our expectations are higher against bad teams and lower against good teams. 

We're surprised when we play so well against Arsenal, but never mind that Arsenal have already played poor against sides worse than us. We're surprised when we barely handle Bournemouth, but no one will probably remember that when they inevitably kill a giant. 

It's just the way it goes. I think the valid statement of the past couple years is that when it comes down to crunch time we have collectively imploded against teams of all sizes. You can blame some of that on a lack of a winning mentality, but then again no one says City lacks a winning mentality last year when they themselves failed so spectacularly at the last bit of the season. 

In general I think the sports world paints in too broad a brush. I think if Firmino, Benteke, and Sturridge all have good to great seasons, you will see us have a great season. I think we've come to know what we can expect from just about everyone else. I would be surprised if, even when he's the most dangerous man on the pitch, Coutinho gets double digit goals. It's just unlikely because he so rarely finds himself inside the box. He could score 9 world class goals but it would still only be 9 goals. Hendo, similarly, I think could be great but it's not the type of great that can elevate a team to title contention. I don't know quite how to articulate this, because I think we need Hendo to win a title. But I also think we can't win a title without some other plus.

Either way. People saying we couldn't finish top 4 were always being boo boys. There could be a ten point gap at the end of any season between 4 and 5. Just as easily 1st could be six points from 6th. We certainly aren't the first or second best squad. But I think you could argue, if most of our players are firing on all cylinders, that we could easily pip either of those squads to a title when we aren't forced to suffer CL.

(Say all you want about EL, our squad is now strong enough that we don't need to play our best squad in that competition to be competitive.)",null,0,null,1440485563,null,null,1440485815,0,cueu605,null,t3_3iasp9,null,null,null,t1_cuetzgb,null,null,null,1441456433,null,6,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

First Mignolet has been immense.  
For half of last season he was terrible.  So bad Brad Jones took over.  Then something changed.  Since then Miggy has been nothing short of excellent.  His growth as a player from when we first signed him is impressive.  

Second, with the GK being better the CB's can play less desperately.  It seemed at time they were trying to do too much, trying to prevent everything from going through and thus getting pulled out of position.  Now they trust him and instead stay in shape.  

Third the fullbacks.  For the first time in a long time our fullbacks look great.  Clyne is so good damn good positioning, defending, man marking when to go forward and when to stay back.  I'd bend an ear to anyone than can point to a flaw in his current game.  Gomez has been great.  Mostly he is defense first which is exactly what he should be doing.  The main point here is that the fullbacks aren't out of position which keeps the center backs in place and allowing them to guard the middle.  

Fourth the protection.  Can, Lucas, Milner, Allen, Henderson are all great foils.  They all offer different styles and you can't refresh this subreddit without an argument over who should start.

Aside from the likelihood that these videos were heavily edited, focussing on the wrong answers and removing correct answers, there's also the factor that I really don't think our population would be any better with geography, even that which is on our doorstep.

The astroturfing of communications and a complicit media means that individual privacy will never really be on the UK political agenda, as Cannataci is suggesting as a solution, because the appropriate time and gravity will not be given to it in public. The BBC's rabid denunciation of Snowden after the leaks is a perfect example of this. Spooks in every country spend a lot of time avoiding scrutiny of themselves and their clients and they do it very well. If they can keep small things like politicians in paedo rings and the Bilderberg Group covered up, there is a reasonable expectation they can cover up bigger stuff too. The only reason we're having this discussion is because people leaked a hell of a lot of information at great personal cost.

It's difficult for a state to reconcile the necessity for espionage with individual privacy. They will never be willing to give up power and unless the public actively ask and fight for it, they never will. People posting here saying ""I'M FINE WITH THIS. I AIN'T GOT NUFFIN' TO 'IDE."" reflect a significant amount of the British public, like it or not there is no reasonable expectation for change without raising public awareness.

In the end it won't be until that information is used improperly that people will complain; and that's fine for the state because the media controls the social climate of acceptability in this country so it will never be a problem. Remember all the anti-Muslim stories the media ran in the 1990s? Me neither.

The internet of today is the enemy of the state because information wants to be free.

Celtic is not a cultural thing - the Celtic peoples were a subgroup of Indo-European that split early, starting somewhere around Switzerland/Northern Italy most probably and then spread through much of Europe, becoming Celto-Iberians in Spain, Gauls in France and then finally Britons (who even later split into Welsh, Breton, Cumbrian etc) and the Irish in the British Isles.",null,0,null,1440489653,null,null,false,0,cuev8be,null,t3_3iail9,null,null,null,t1_cuetgmc,null,null,null,1441456934,null,5,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

Clyne has seemed the only fullback we've had in years who remains capable of being a threat going forward, just as much as he's a rock in the back.

Ireland uses the Euro as its currency, while Scotland uses the Pound. The Irish economy was hit pretty badly during the late 2000s recession, and is still pretty sluggish from what I've heard. The Scottish economy has been more stable throughout this period.

&gt; politics

Ireland is an independent country and has its own president, legislature and political parties (quite what the difference between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael is though is beyond me). Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, but has its own 'devolved' administration which includes the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government. They have control over a wide range of policy areas (healthcare, education, law, etc) but certain other matters (foreign affairs, defence) are controlled by the British Government at Westminster. There's also an ongoing political debate about Scotland's place within the UK's constitutional framework.

&gt; people in general?

Naturally, Irish and Scottish culture is distinct. However both countries are (broadly) liberal. Scotland has developed a reputation lately from social justice while Ireland recently legalised same-sex marriage by a wide margin. Ireland though still has severe restrictions on abortion and only fully legalised divorce in 1996. This was due to the major influence of the Catholic Church, but their power appears to be weakening over time.

I agree. I think we all have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Unfortunately, it seems that expectation is not only not met, but trampled on by certain companies. And the excuse is that it's in our interest to have these tools monitor all we do. ""We can give you such a better experience by doing this"".

I've recently had ADSL turned back on and am seriously considering ditching the Wireless. 

My suspicion is that a single heavy user on your same subnet means you will be shit out of luck. There appears to be no traffic shaping in use to prevent this. This diagnosis was declared impossible by the engineer who came out and spoke to my wife.

If her account is accurate (she's not technical), he either doesn't understand the network he's working on, or he straight out lied.

My neighbour (about 100m away) got it installed the same time as me and found it so poor, at all times, that he stopped paying after the first month and stuck with ADSL.

I've been involved in anti-surveillance and pro-privacy campaigns for more than a decade now and that is a very common response. The conversation then goes:

""Ok, can I have your PIN number then?""

""No, of course not.""

""Why don't you trust me with your PIN and why do you trust them with all your information?""

""It isn't the same.""

As the conversation goes on they usually realise that someone they don't know, or trust, and have no reason to trust has access to all of their information and their best defence against it is to hope that they won't use it against them. Is the kind of person who would collect all of your information the sort of person who wouldn't use it against you at some point?

I follow a few London riders on Youtube (I feel bad for RJ :-/) and is a great source about getting the UK ridding style. 

For open roads I've been around a year following (or trying to) the UK police riding style learning from youtube videos and I even had an instructor who teached me a very similar ""safe for open roads style"".

For London traffic... wow, that's another world. I really like how filtering is accepted there (with common sense rules) and how motorbikes avoid traffic. 

Generally I see UK car drivers more respectful with motorbikes than Spanish ones, here nobody move their car so the bike can go trough. I live in a city where many cars just ignore red lights at night and so many drivers change lanes ignoring you. I even had a hit&amp;run years ago. So I tend to ride in a very defensive way and won't think London will be a problem.

My main fear is getting confused with the lanes when I take a junction or the correct lane to take (the slow one on the right, the fast one on the right). But I suppose I'll have my brain used to it in about a week.

  Management is concerned with the effective use and coordination of materials and labour within organisations in the pursuit of the organisation’s defined objectives. It considers the inter-relationship and interactions between distinct parts of an organisation, and between the organisation and its environment. Management students look at theories, models and frameworks in order to understand how managers behave and consider their role in the process of decision-making.

I think this makes it pretty clear, you can also look at specific courses taken in the degree on the website which will give you an idea about the differences between e&amp;m and ppe.

What makes you think that's untrue?

&gt;No mention of the huge numbers of depression in young men, 

Well, that's presumably because women are much more likely to experience depression... As it says quite clearly.

&gt;the massive proportion of men who commit suicide compared to women every year. 

Men and women *attempt* suicide at roughly the same rate. Men are more likely to succeed, largely because they're more likely to choose hanging (statistically the most effective way of committing suicide). Before anyone gets in there, there's no reason to believe that women make their attempts as a 'cry for help', either: They genuinely try and genuinely fail.

Therefore, the MRA-favourite stat about male suicide rates is a red herring.

&gt;But who cares about that, they were all misogynists anyway, right?

null,null,the_leander,null,null,null,"&gt;Except dogs aren't predators.

Except they [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae). They are social animals that generally work in packs to co-operatively bring down bigger prey as a group than they could as individuals. The only difference between a wolf and a dog is typically the species they look to as their Alpha (wild dogs reverting to full pack mentality). 

&gt;A predator is something that hunts for food.

Not according to your own hand picked dictionary definition. 

&gt;They don't do all the things required to be a predator.

They can and do chase down prey items, can kill and eat their prey etc. The only thing that stops them from doing this for the most part is that they are given training and food. But those instincts to chase and kill are still there, hell they're so close to the surface that they're used as the means of encouraging greyhounds to race. 

In this particular case, the dog in question had previously attacked and killed one of this farmer's sheep. Even by your twisted definitions, [this dog was a full blown predator with form](http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/farmers-shooting-warning-after-sheep-18982/). 

&gt; They just chase and bite or just chase.

Even if this were true, which it isn't, that alone is more than enough on its own to kill sheep. 

&gt;Dog's don't naturally prey on anything.

Have you ever even owned a dog? Even something as small and cute as a Yorkshire Terrier will absolutely destroy a rat or mouse if given the chance. Hell, its what they were bred to do originally.

Then we have those programmes that make claims like ""Feed yourself for 30 pence a day"" only they forget to mention that you'll need a fully featured and stocked kitchen to do it and a fair amount of free time.

Most of those programmes though are just poverty porn or an excuse for the middle classes to sneer at chavs.",null,1,null,1440493347,null,null,1440495046,0,cuew333,null,t3_3ib81b,null,null,null,t3_3ib81b,null,null,null,1441457337,null,-5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5,null

""You people""??? Seriously? Are all who dare to criticize Lamela part of one huge negative group?

I've not even mentioned Dembele, and I don't see him as the answer. What I do think is clear, is that Lamela currently isn't - and playing Lamela now hurts the team and it hurts Lamela (and his value). 

If Lamela can re-find some form in Italy, then all the better. ",null,0,null,1440493373,null,null,false,0,cuew3bg,null,t3_3iaw2j,null,null,null,t1_cuew1ab,null,null,null,1441457340,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null
