Given that its staffed by less than five people, it does a pretty good job at what it does. 

I never bother reading Sam McBride's crap though. I understand the paper has a unionist readership but it's of no interest to me. Believe me, if the Newsletter thought it could diversify, it would, but like all papers its going the way of the dodo. If you want to blame the quality on anything, blame it on the same problem that's affecting all the old print models.

That said, I like the fact that it's such an old paper with a strong history. People (mainly Republicans who never read it) just want to shit on it all the time because it's unionist, but one of my mates is a reporter there and he works really fucking hard and never comes off with any sectarianism in his articles, so I tend to just roll my eyes every time the NI circlejerk breaks out.

A merger with the DUP would be more to the benefit of the UUP though, seeing as they are a failing political force. For the DUP to absorb them would require unionism itself to be in real dire straits. Another scenario could be the UUP just keeps getting smaller until the DUP is the only major unionist party? I don't follow unionist party politics much though so have no idea. 

I often wonder whether there would be a merger of the shinners and the stoops. SF would probably be up for it, but the stoops would not.

A party that spent two ""terms"" in power is decidedly less likely to get votes this time around because that party is unlikely to have been perfect, so they switched.

However, after Blair was elected in the nineties, he began shifting the normally leftist Labour party to the right, which was usually the domain of the Conservatives.

This shift took place over a number of years and no replacement Left party arose to take its' place. Several parties have tried, such as the Lib Dems and Greens, but none of them can be considered as mainstream and entrenched as the Conservatives or Labour.

On top of this, the Conservatives haven't been as right-wing as they promised in their last manifesto. This is partly due to the Lib Dems and partly due to unexpected weakness in the party itself, such as Theresa May spectacularly failing at her job for five years on the trot, and Ian Duncan Smith doing precisely the same while sneering at people on benefits.

So we've reached a point where people who want to vote for a leftist party find themselves merely voting for the party that happens to be least right-wing rather than actually left-wing.

Imagine a pendulum. It needs to swing in two directions to be able to keep its' own momentum going. If you stop it from swinging in one direction it isn't going to just magically keep swinging in the other.

So we have a situation where the two ""main"" parties are becoming closer in terms of politics which leaves a significant chunk of the population feeling like these parties don't represent them. Those of a right-wing persuasion have experimented with parties like UKIP while left-wingers have either stuck to Labour despite knowing it's a mug's game or tried to boost the ailing statistics of the Greens or the Lib Dems.

So despite the fact that we're a theoretically liberal country with liberal tendencies...the only liberals we have to vote for are those who don't have a snowball's chance of winning because ingrained voters will always vote for the same party while those like us that are more disenfranchised either won't vote or don't have any means of networking enough to concentrate our efforts on a party that might actually try to realise what we want for the country.

Even if we did have that, the Greens are idiots and the Lib Dems, while moderately competent in coalition, I suspect would be decidedly less so in power.

So before we could even focus our efforts and our votes we'd need an actual political party to vote for.

It goes without saying that we'd have been better off without the injuries, but every team suffers injuries. United had a torrid time at the front end of the season with injuries but still eked out wins. 

It's the responsibility of a manager to adapt to misfortune and change the way the team plays. In my opinion, Rodgers has failed to do that, we've had games this season with three strikers on the bench and Sterling alone up front, and it's ultimately a lack of goals that has put us where we are. 

I don't disagree that our strikers have been poor this season but I feel that you also need to clarify that by saying we haven't even attempted to play to any of their strengths or given them enough of a chance in a team with a tactic that plays to those strengths.
 
Granted, we don't know what happens on the training ground and we can't see what Rodgers sees there, but we can see what happens on the pitch and in the media. What we've seen there is a team that struggles to create chances and put away goals, we've seen a manager that has pretty much strung his main striking option out to dry with negative comments. 

That's why, for me, regardless of injuries or the transfer committee and so on, responsibility has to fall on Rodgers' shoulders and therefore why we should be having these discussions.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"I think the feeling is more that footballers are *incredibly* lucky to be born with a football-playing skill set in a society that values football players. I know they work hard, and they retire early so that they have to be rewarded for what they do, but it is also true that if I practiced for my entire life I probably wouldn't be as good at football as Rooney was when he was 12 - some people are lucky to be born with natural talent. Additionally, they are incredibly lucky to be born into a society where footballers are paid more than academics, or doctors. It is not inconceivable that in a few years eSport will be as big as football in some countries (including the UK). If that happened being born with good physical fitness and foot-eye coordination might not be as important as being born with good reaction times and ability to memorise rule sets. So if the player in question had been born a decade after he actually was, maybe all his football playing talent would have been for naught. My point is that high earning isn't soley a function of hard work and risk-taking; some of it is to do with the structure of society, or even raw luck.

As a society, we say, ""We find that football players are incredibly beneficial to the economy, and we know that not everyone who wants to be a footballer can be. So footballers (who earn millions) pay a small fraction of that to subsidise those who didn't make it as footballers (or who took a risk on another project which didn't work out)"". This is a sort of social contract between society and high-earners; you pay us a fraction of your high wages, and we keep in place the social systems which allow you to make so much money.

When footballers whine about how their life is so difficult compared to people on benefits, it represents a pretty handy trashing of this social contract. Doubly so if they also try and avoid tax, which is what the rich are doing at the moment and creating the hostility which so perturbation the owner of this Twitter account. I don't think anyone really has a problem with high earners, but people do have a problem with people who use their high-earning status as an excuse to attack those less lucky than them, or to try and buy their way out of the social contract which aims to protect people like them if they fail in their ambitions.",null,0,null,1429956198,null,0,1429956561,0,cqo4ads,null,t3_33qc8a,null,t1_cqo4ads,null,t1_cqo44pu,null,null,null,1432594021,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I've checked, you won't save anything by booking in advance from Reading to London, but from London to Luton there are cheaper fares if you book in advance.

If there are, these cheap tickets (called ""advance"" tickets) work like this: there is a fixed number sold for each specific train at each price. Once the cheapest ones sell out, the price goes up until the next cheapest tier sells out, and the next, and the next, until there are no more Advance tickets. Then you can only buy the flexible walk-up tickets. The absolute deadline for booking them is 2359 on the day before travel.

Advance tickets are cheap, but you have to use them on the specific train you're booked on (if you miss your train you need to buy another ticket.) And you can't get a refund if your travel plans change.

I would hardly say FSG is inclined towards British talent either. Paying over the odds for players doesn't fit that bill, which is required when signing homegrown talent. We signed Lallana because he does fit the bill and works perfectly in our fluid, attacking, pressing system (when he's fit) and we signed Lambert because he was a second option, cheap(ish), and probably to an extent because of his Liverpool story. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out for Lambert because we haven't even had a good first option this year.

As for Lovren, I'd say that was the result of some poor scouting and a failure to recognize that a great deal of his success at Southampton was due to having two of the best DMs in the league supporting him. Which isn't to say I think Lovren can't come good, but I think our system when we had a 4-fluid 6 (which really is the best way to put it) put A LOT of stress on the two CBs because our slow DMs and wingbacks bombing up the sides.

null,false,bloop24,lfc99,,null,"Rodgers.  The blame has to fall on Rodgers.  We've met none of the goals we set out to meet this season and no matter how well he managed to turn this season around from how we started that first half of the season made top 4 for us a long shot.  Had we brought in a top class striker like we needed to we wouldn't be in this mess.  Sturridge's injury was unfortunate but we all know he is injury prone and we made a panic buy of Balotelli at the end of the transfer window.  

United's start to the season really to me shows what having clinical forwards brings you.  They played like shit but RVP and Rooney etc. will put away any chances they get.  

Rodgers took entirely too long to fix our problems from the start of the season imo.  I like Rodgers but you just cannot take half a season to find a system that isn't utter shit.  I think when Balotelli/Lambert were really our only 2 strikers(also Borini I suppose but I just don't think he's good enough) we should have catered our system to them.  You can't try to play a pressing game where your forwards make runs behind the defence when your forwards are Lambert or Balotelli.  Balotelli recently though has looked like he's started to adapt to the way we play and has looked good the last few times he's played.  

Sterling alone up top was never going to work as anything more than a stop gap since he just doesn't have that eye for goal yet.  We should have either paired him up top with one of Balotelli or Lambert imo both who can finish chances or just never put him there.  

Rodgers three at the back system has definitely sorted most of our defensive issues(barring individual errors like ones Moreno has once in a while) but it absolutely killed our penetration into the box.  I'm not even really sure why it's done that but it has.  

Getting 5th this season is the bare minimum.  Anything lower and we need serious changes.  Whether that is a new transfer strategy, manager or whatever something needs to change if we can't scrape 5th at least out of this season.  I really do like Rodgers but I keep getting the feeling that his inexperience is costing us time and time again.  He's brilliant when he gets it right but frequently he is too slow to get it right and once he's found out he doesn't adjust quick enough.

Don't know if anyone will read this, but I think it's disturbing that the mods of /r/unitedkingdom would remove the top-post, a news article featuring an interview with Ed Miliband - without any comment at all. 

Edit:  I was just informed by mod /u/ooer that:

&gt;The article itself misrepresents the information. You did nothing wrong yourself.

to which I replied:

&gt;Was it the post title?  I thought it best to use the exact wording used in the article.

&gt;As far as the article misrepresenting information.  I think there are valid questions about whether Muslim News were spinning Miliband's remarks.  But, that was being actively discussed in the comments section and I don't see that deleting the post was the best way of handling this situation.

Edit:  The mods have allowed it back on.

Edit II:  Final response from /u/ooer

* Ed supports making 'Islamophobic' crime aggrevated and zero tolerance. In practice means very heavily punishing minor offenses - things like public order and twitter speech offences - because they offend Muslims.
* Muslims are actively pushing for rollback of the Prevent counter-extremism programme, a neccesary attempt to prevent British Muslims going off on Jihad. Ed is willing to meet them halfway with an overhaul.
* Muslims ""charities"" have rightly had financial services removed by banks and been criticised in the press becuase of concerns they support terrorists and funds are used to promote Islamism. This is brought up as a complaint, and Ed again is willing to go halfway and suggest things need to be fairer.
* On the Trojan Horse scandal, the Muslim view is that it didn't happene. Ed said is is a problem, but gets the diagnosis wrong and says local accountability is the solution.
* On to foreign policy and predictably the first Muslim complaint is about the Jews. Ed support recognition of a Palestinian State, fair enough. The Muslims want more and sanctions against Israel, Ed rightly is not in favour.
* **What happens next is obscene. Muslims want people who travel to Syria to fight against the Islamic State jailed. The reasons obvious, they have a lot of sympathy for the 1500 Brits who have gone to Syria on Jihad and not for their victims or those who fight against them. Ed agrees with this. How do you fuck up a basic moral judgement like that?**
* Ed finally manages to squeeze in some good stuff on deprivation, home building, minimum wage, and employment in response to a question on religious discrimination.
* They complain about Ed using the term “Islamist terrorism” Ed refuses to change his language.

null,false,LinuxMage,,LibDem | UK Federalist,null,"I don't think the next 5 years are going to be good for whoever gets to be in government, except maybe for the LD's. This Election will be their lowpoint, and they will have a stronger playing field in 2020. The reason? The LD's have built a policy book based on the idea that they will be a junior coalition partner, and have left lots of room and flexibility with them, so everything is negotiable. 

However, the next 5 years will be tough for both the Labour Party and the Conservatives. Neither parties policy is predicated on having to negotiate or half-way solutions. 

Plus, I can see another push for AV/STV/PR coming soon, as the smaller parties vie to get more say in parliament, and more consideration for their policies. 

2020 could either see the introduction of such a voting system, meaning that coalitions will become the normal way of government here or the public will become utterly fedup of the idea of unstable government, and go for the one of the Big Parties. 

Realistically, there is every chance that over the next 5 years, the cons and labs could lose their place as the largest parties, as the electorate vote and membership becomes more evenly spread (imagine in 2020 a situation where cons get 100 seats, lab get 100 seats, UKIP get 50 seats, Libs get 50 seats, SNP have their 50 seats, and greens might have 20+ seats....). This would lead to even more calls for a PR/AV/STV system. 

I believe that Politics in the UK is seeing a massive shift, a sea change if you will. I suggest people in the UK get used to the idea of coalition, as I personally believe it will become the norm.",null,0,null,1429958757,null,0,false,0,cqo4t3h,null,t3_33p7u5,null,t1_cqo4t3h,null,t3_33p7u5,null,null,null,1432594265,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

I like Klopp as a coach, and Rodgers did great things last season, there's no doubt about either of those things. I just feel that if someone is going to make **yet another Klopp post**, then it should at least be linear, coherent, not contradictory, and not be insulting to the entire ""mind-numbingly simplified"" sub.

We're going to play two strikers for the foreseeable future. That means 2 attacking midfield spots. That means one of Silva, one left for Navas/Nasri/Milner.

Were we to have Silva/New Talent/Navas we still need an extra member for depth. We have Rony Lopes on loan who has definitely done enough to be first team material. Depay doesn't really fit in as he isn't good enough in my opinion to demand a start here (Unlike United who have no widemen) and for depth we have the right men.

As for Gundogan. The issue of Ilkay Gundogan is that barring Yaya we have no intent to move any of our mids on. Fernandinho and Fernando are too recent acquisitions and that means we need to replace Yaya with a player of his quality. Gundogan is being purchased to possibly replace Carrick but United know if he's a crock, Carrick can stay on for one or two more years.

As for Silva. Silva is at his most effective when he can do what he wants. He's best given license to pretty much wander wherever. Him playing the 10 whilst I like, only will work with Bony on the pitch. Aguero needs Silva to be close to him at all times so he doesn't become isolated and forced to hold the ball up. That gums up the rest of the team. Better to play how we did in both title seasons were David starts left, a bigger player or a grafter stays next to Aguero and David gets to do what he wants under the condition that the pivot covers the left side more and the right sided attacking mid covers for them when they inch over. That's why I'm hoping we get De Bruyne for a number of reasons as yo how that works.

As for Navas, he isn't leaving. Milner is and Nasri probably. Can bitch and whine but Navas is a good player, just limited and part of a two piece set where the nice big bastard piece got sent to Valencia and our replacement piece from Swansea hasnt bedded in yet.

Obey the rules of the road and don't go on pavements, you will be responsible if you hit someone and can get a big fine. 

Get the best bike you can afford is the general rule as cheap stuff just breaks faster. Mountain bikes will take more abuse but a road bike will be faster and easier on a commute. 

Always carry a spare tube, multi tool and pump - this will cover most on the road issues. Keep the bike clean and look after it and less will go wrong. There are plenty of helpful maintenance videos around.

For commuting, try to use bike lanes as much as possible. It depends on your route but there should be some. Google maps should show you. Technically it's illegal to ride your bike on the footpath and I never have since I was a kid. If you get a decent road bike, you wouldn't want to due to the lack of suspension and jumping up and down kerbs. You also have to stop at every junction to check for traffic. 

Most people use road bikes or hybrids for commuting and use the road or bike lanes. Your work should have the bike to work scheme where they essentially use your tax to pay for a new bike. Ask your HR department. I'd recommend Chain Reaction or McConvey cycles for good quality bikes and customer service. The sales people there will really sort you out with the right bike and set it up. You can also pay with finance.

If you are on the roads, it comes down to experience. The first few times will be scary and indecisive. But it gets better and you will become more confident. Always stay on the left most lane. The key is to ride defensively where you don't hug the kerb, so people can't dangerously overtake you. Imagine the middle line, between the middle of the lane and kerb. Don't be bullied, ignore the cars behind you. If you need to turn right, check your shoulder before the turn and stick out your ride hand. The car behind will always slow. Do the same for the left, in case someone undertakes you on a bike. I'd recommend a cheap rear light to make you slightly more visible, even for day time. You will need a good set of front and rear lights for winter riding.

Best of luck. Cycling is definitely the best way to commute. It's cheaper in the long run, good exercise, prevents congestion and is good for the environment. The more people cycling the better. Additionally, the drivers in NI are very good with cyclists. I've commuted in Aberdeen and it was hell.

Edit: Did you know you can change the car icon to a bike on Google Maps to get the best cycling route? Avoid junctions as best you can. Your route is quite an ascent but a good workout for the morning. At least after work it's all downhill!

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt; Yeah a lot of the time hard work pays off, but there are plenty of people busting their guts trying to better their lives that won't succeed through pure chance alone.

Don't get me wrong, being in the right place at the right time helps matters, but over the course of a lifetime, how do you work hard and yet end up with nothing? Seriously, how?

Sure, some will become relatively more successful than others, and there will undoubtedly be setbacks along the way, but even if you work stacking shelves in Tescos your whole life and simply do 20 hours overtime a week, you'll be earning well over 20k/year, and that will enable you to buy a property (not necessarily the property you want in the area you want, mind), it will enable you to buy a reasonably nice car, go on regular holidays and have money left over for investments which over the long term will make you ever richer and stop you needing to work all that overtime in the first place! All it requires is financial discipline and a work ethic. And that's *before* you look at the examples I gave above, education is available to all at any age.

Why do you think literally half a million eastern Europeans each year are packing their bags and leaving everything they've ever known behind to come here? It's not for the fucking weather, I can assure you!

I come from a poor background. I can you flat out: A lot of people I grew up with really do not have any drive to succeed in life. They're quite happy being poor(ish) and moaning about it - it's actually quite a nice life, fosters a great sense of community... The problem is what it will do to the country if this moaning becomes a big enough political issue to illicit change.

EDIT: Forgot to add:

&gt;I've done pretty well for myself which boils down to roughly 1/3 hard work, 1/3 confidence and 1/3 right time right place.

Unless you're deploying on a combat op, you're rules of engagement will defer to your inherent right to self defense, which allows for pre-emptive action.

Paraphrasing, this allows the use of reasonable force based on your honest belief of the situation.

To clarify, if you believe that another's life is in immediate danger, even if yours isn't, it is reasonable to use lethal force to preserve the threatened life.

Another, less legal jargon classification. If you think you're about to get punched, you can punch first. If in court the judge doesn't think your belief was reasonable, you shouldn't have punched.

Lancaster is  good for business, and has a relatively new business school and is rated very highly in the business regards. Look at the business league tables and it's around 7th in the UK, which is not bad at all, though do bear in mind it's figures in the league tables are pulled up a lot by Student Satisfaction and the quality of it's accomodation - which of course are things you should consider but don't seem like priorites for  you.

I'll go through your other points;

- Employment prospects for business aren't really my field of interest, i'm afraid, but you do get companies coming round to the campus which seem to take an interest, and there are a lot of fairs for employment and things - but lets be honest, those are everywhere.

- Fun is debateable. I have fun here, but i'm a shy, unsociable person who likes to spend the majority of his Friday nights in bed or playing video games. Lancaster is a lovely town but you don't go to lancaster if you want to spend every night out because it's limited in it's amount of pubs and clubs. It's very good for socieites, and the collegeiate system enables this even moreso with sports.

- Weather. You're going to the north of the UK, it's going to be shite either way.

- Footabll. The Student Union sets up cheap trips to Morcombe football club, which are the closest nearby, which will be quite enjoyable because Lower League football allways is. There are also football teams for every college, and one of the bars on campus is focused on sports and will show things like the champions league.

- Beer. Whatever one you go to, You're going to be able to drink a lot of beer, and probably be encouraged to by flatmates. I wouldn't worry about it.

They're both great though, but it'd be best to go to an open day if you haven't allready.

null,false,sidvicc,null,null,null,"This is an very biased in-depth look at Klopp's career but since you stated your intention in the beginning that's understandable:

&gt; What no one will acknowledge in that is that the Bundesliga is, for all intents and purposes, a one team league. This means that only one team must slip up for another to win. That, in stark contrast, to the four clubs who have consolidated power and money in England.

This is just THE BEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD (TM) hogwash. Yes Bayern are utterly dominant but both Wolfsburg and Dortmund have won it in recent memory. As of this weekend the points seperating 1st and 2nd is 12 points in the Bundesliga and 10 points in the Premier League. Not exactly a heaven and earth difference. 

Secondly you don't acknowledge that the difference between a one team Bundesliga and a top-4 dominated Prem cuts both ways. Yes there are more difficult teams to play but that's true for your opponent as well, i.e. more teams to take points off them. It's hard to beat a dominant team when you know that everyone else is going to roll over for them. 

&gt; In Klopps fourth season in charge he defended the Bundesliga title with 81 points to Bayern's 73

I like how you spent a paragraph drawing doubt to the quality of their first league win (not competing in CL, Bayern having a difficult year) and then only 2 lines for the second title. 

It takes a hell of a lot to keep a title, more so than winning one in the first place. 

At the end of the day the point is actually very simple, Klopp has actually won the biggest domestic prize in front of him, twice, back to back, while fighting off a dominant team that is much stronger than his. This is not coming close, or point-swing comparisons, it's actually sealing the deal, going the final yard and winning it. That's what essentially separates him from Rodgers.

Don't use busy paths but you'll learn where the empty strips are. If your holding up traffic cos of a thing lane or bends n stuff, hop onto the pavement at a good chance and let it clear before dropping back down to the road.

FSG and Rodgers transfer strategy is CRAP. 

""You can look at recent examples of other teams who've tried this transfer policy and see how it worked out for them. Prime example: Arsenal, spent nearly a decade on a ""youth crusade"", won nothing, clicked on and switched to ""spend big on proven talents"" immediately won something and lo and behold attracted more proven talents off the back of it.
United did the same, fall out the top 4? How do you get back? Sign a bunch of youth? No, sign proven talent, immediately back into the top 4. The evidence is pretty clear that in the modern age of football money talks, and before anyone comes along saying ""Oh well we don't have the money for it"" bullshit, Lovren, Lallana, Markovic are all expensive signings, we have players like Johnson on 6 figure wages. We have the money we're just shit at using it e.g. last summer where we spent over £100 mill and got very little to show for it this year. Hell, we've spent more than Arsenal since Rodgers came here and their signings are still streets ahead of most of ours.
People need to stop kidding themselves and look at things objectively and rationally. People go round pretending we've got players on a fiver a week and we traded Benfica a can of lentil beans for Markovic. It's horse shit, wake up. Look at Southampton, they sign better players than us who are immediately useful to the team for less money on less wages! It's absurd.

I messaged the mods and was informed by mod /u/ooer that:

&gt;The article itself misrepresents the information. You did nothing wrong yourself.

to which I replied:

&gt;Was it the post title?  I thought it best to use the exact wording used in the article.

&gt;As far as the article misrepresenting information.  I think there are valid questions about whether Muslim News were spinning Miliband's remarks.  But, that was being actively discussed in the comments section and I don't see that deleting the post was the best way of handling this situation.

Edit:  I will also say that ill-defined loosely applied criteria like this are often invoked in censoring posts.  They provide a patina of plausible deniability and can be selectively applied to silence troublesome opinions.

Edit II:  The squeaky wheel received the grease.  The mods have allowed it back on.

Edit III:  Final response from mod /u/ooer:

&gt;You raise a really good point there, sorry for having an itchy trigger finger.

&gt;People can make their own mind up about the spin involved, I am just used to removing inaccurate information from the other subs I moderate.

null,false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,null,"&gt;Austerity on its own doesn't put any extra wealth in the hands of the wealthy

There are some fairly convincing arguments that it does just that, by these mechanisms:

* Austerity can depress the economy, reducing asset prices and allowing the wealthy to pick up assets at below their long term value.

* Austerity leads to cuts in public services, compelling people to buy some of those services from private suppliers. 

* Austerity can result in privatisations, and again the wealthy can pick up assets at below their long term value.

Of course, some wealthy people lose out with austerity: the drop in aggregate demand isn't good for anyone running a business, and cuts in government spending aren't good for government suppliers. If anything austerity benefits rent seekers more than it does people owning productive businesses.

1. In baseball, the decision for trades (transfers) is solely conducted by the general manager. For Liverpool, we have the transfer committee, upon which Rodgers sits. So that comparison in itself is flawed.

2. This is not entirely true either and a bit complicated. There are a couple of reasons why Francona (arguably the most successful manager in Red Sox history) was let go: the article talks about his souring relationship with the ownership but fails to delve into Francona's last two seasons as manager: both failed to reach the playoffs and in the last campaign - he went from being 1st to collapsing on some ridiculous 20 game losing streak to lose the playoff spot (also in dramatic fashion on the last game of the last day). The next manager, Valentine, had an awful record and didn't have respect of the clubhouse (the players). The current manager, John Farrell, did have one of the worst seasons ever last year, but the year before it he overachieved (like Liverpool last year) and won the World Series (aka Champions league final/top of premiership).

[This is not necessarily true]( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myth-4-immediate-necessity.html). Usually the Bank of England can cut interest rates to compensate for the impacts of austerity, so it doesn't harm GDP or cause unemployment. The problem is that interest rates are at 0.5% and can't be cut further, so this isn't an option, and austerity will harm growth. Most economists who criticise austerity would have preferred it to be delayed until interest rates were back to normal, and would have no problem with austerity then, as it would not harm growth. (It might still damage public services, but that might be unavoidable.) Some economists disagree with this, and say that the Bank of England can compensate for austerity even without cutting interest rates, through things like quantitative easing, but that's uncertain.

Lallana is a decent player, but £25mil for him is an absolute joke. Could've got far better ones (like Firmino) for cheaper. For that amount of money, you should expect someone world class. He may fit in our pressing system, but going forward, he slows down a lot of our attacks with his pointless Cruyff turns. Bench player at best for us imo. 
Lambert is a baffling buy. Hope we sell him this summer for the benefit of everyone involved. 
Lovren is the worst buy, simply put. Don't think he'll come good and I'll readily offload him in the summer (interest from Sociedad apparently).
I wouldn't be arsed much if Rodgers is sacked. If there are signs of progress and more importantly of him learning from his mistakes, I'm willing to be patient. The mid season switch to 3-4-3 and playing our best defender in Sakho regularly was partly down to the injuries we had, or God knows where we would be right now.

As a result the right to buy ladder was pulled up behind said landlords and we have to pick up the bill.

The tories have mismanaged the economy to the point the deficit has increased despite millions having to use food banks to feed themselves because of an austerity method, that a majority of economists who actually have education in these matters, advised against.

I grew up in a northern former mining town, rife with poverty and crime because there were no jobs at all until labour invested in redeveloping the land so businesses could build on it, only to then be told that I now have to tighten the belt because of the lavish lifestyle I was apparently living beforehand when the tories banker friends fucked the economy.

We are an exploited generation and we need to fight back, we should not be paying more for less at every turn.

null,false,IstariAtheist,null,null,null,"""You keep claiming that there's no biological basis for race, but there really is,"" 

This commits the begging the question fallacy, you are using circular reasoning. Just because something is a social construct doesn't mean it isn't a work of fiction. Religion is a social construct, it is real only in the sense that it represents what people believe, it is however false. I consider the belief in religion as unjustified as the belief in race. Racism exists because it is an intolerable unjustified belief. You are not a racist but you believe in race so I consider your belief an unjustified one.

I studied Biochemistry and learned at my university by my lecturer that race has no biological basis, it is an illusion. For our species individuals an average share 99.9% of their genetics, so individually we differ by that 0.1%. So of this 0.1% genes that encode for skin colour, eye colour, hair colour, blood group, body type etc ALL this stuff. Now you say

""Regardless, race, roughly defined, is just those physical characteristics that you're given when your born."" This is nonsense sorry. Your phenotype is essentially what you look like when genetics within your genotype are expressed. So you would say people who look brown/black are what? a race? Really? Well what if a guy who has black skin shares the same blood group, same eye colour, has the same body type (say both men are endomorphs) etc. It makes no sense to group people up based on one trait, hypothetically if I'm DYING and I need a blood transfusion, someone with a different skin colour could save my life as my body will accept their blood type whilst what? Someone of my own 'race' say didn't have the same blood type... the guy who has more in common with me genetically is somehow part of a different race based on what? this social construct. It's rubbish. Why not have endomorph and ectomorph races? Why not have a ginger race? What about eye colour?

At least with democracy it's based on a social contract, we all agree (or most of us) that our say should be equally counted. The justification comes from the agreement between people, and that is why it is justified, unlike the concept of race that requires biology for it's justification.

To add:
If a loose and uncontrolled dog causes you to crash while on your bicycle, then provided you can identify the owner, you can pursue a civil personal injury claim against the owner/person responsible for the dog. The normal rules relating to claims based on negligence and/or breach of statutory duty apply. The pet owner or handler owes a duty of care and is liable because they could have easily foreseen what was likely to happen given that their dog was off the leash, but did not take any ‘reasonable measures’ to prevent it happening.

You're deliberately conflating benefit fraudsters with benefit recipients. I don't think it's fair to do that.

&gt;High earners have this idea that people on benefits earn at a similar level to them. 

No they don't. You just made that up.

High earners, and low earners, have a tendency to resent to the benefits system - and definitely benefit fraud - because it's something for nothing and can seem to undermine the work and effort they put in.

As an anecdote: I spent 8 years at university training for the lower-middle class profession I'm in. After all that time, and all those debts I found myself living in a small flat share that cost half my salary. I got up every weekday and some weekends and commuted for an hour each way to work in order to pay for my room in a shared flat.

Then I went to visit my brother who had been unemployed for as long as I could remember. He lived alone in a flat provided by the council. He got up when he felt like it, sat reading books, watching DVDs, and eating biscuits all day. Then he went to bed again.

I think both are fair, but I feel we still don't know what Rodgers can do. Last season may have been an anomaly. A cinderella run that, I fear, may hurt a potential revival to the Liverpool of yesteryear if Rodgers is allowed to rest on that 1 laurel (a 2nd place finish).

My position as worthless as it may be, is still undecided about the Klopp, Benitez, Rodgers fiasco. I call it a fiasco however I really think it's a matter of spoiled for choice (if we even have a shout with the former).

Perhaps parents and owners should make sure their children and animals run around the large grassy areas of a park, instead of the paths that are legally being used by cyclists.

Point is you don't really know who was in the wrong, but you've decided to lynch the cyclist anyway. In the photograph, the cyclist is clearly on the path and wearing appropriate high vis clothing. One of the other tweets by @garygoldsmith65 suggests his dogs were off their lead. If you're going to let your dogs run around in a park used by cyclists, keep them on the grass and make sure they're well-trained enough to return to you when you shout/whistle. The fact is, the dog that got run over was a puppy, so must be untrained, and shouldn't have been allowed off its lead. On the balance of probabilities, this strikes me as a story about an irresponsible owner, not a careless cyclist.

1.  Theo never had sole say in transfers/trades.  Larry Lucchinano (his mentor) and John Henry had final go/no go on all trades.  This is why Theo quit.

2.  The article understates the amount of public outcry after the 2011 season.  It wasn't just that the results were an unmitigated disaster, it was that the players attitudes were so poor and unlikeable.  Without some heads rolling season memberships would have dropped and the TV ratings (which were in the shitter) would have continued....which means lost revenue).  

Side point here:  FSG has a long history of smear campaigns against players and managers that they fire or quit.  Franconia was just one in a long line (including Theo) that has been painted with a very ugly (marital infedility, drug use) brush.  Raheem's agent should take note he is playing a VERY dangerous game by going public on Raheem's contract.  I think there are some skeleton's in the young lads closet that could affect his marketability and FSG will open it up should he turn on them.

Overall FSG is a very bright patient ownership group that respects the traditions of the teams they own and are not afraid to open up the pocketbook should circumstances dictate.

null,false,Ibster,UnionFlag,"1990 Yamaha RXS100, 2007 Yamaha YBR125, CBR600FN, CBR125R4",null,"The old CBR600f is a pretty bulletproof, capable bike that I would recommend to buy neglected/written off and put on the road, reason being that they are very common and used as track bikes which adds up to there being a lot of spare parts on ebay as well as a fair few bikes being parted out.


I did that with a '92 that was stolen, crashed and then neglected in a garden for a year before being kicked over and left lying for another year.


The main work that needed doing was refreshing forks (3 hours - price of petrol and fork oil), rebuilding all three calipers (2 hours each - seals + fluids to about £30), replacing the levers (30 mins and £30), deep cleaning the carbs (multiple times - 2 days first time, next were done in 3hrs - £6), welding the plastics back up (1hr for each panel - cost of electricity to run the soldering iron), oil and filter (1hr - cant remember), coolant replacement (1hr - £15), brake fluid change and bleeds (30 mins £10), rebuild front master cylinder (£30 and three hours), new key to be cut (£6 and however long it took to remove the ignition barrel and cut a key - I reckon about two days), indicator replacement (£20, 1hr), new windscreen (£20 1hr), new mirrors (£20) , fuel cap bolts (£18), new fuel pipes (£3, 30 mins), foot peg (£14, 1hr), downpipes (1 hr and £170 ouch), bar end weights (20 mins £10), bottle of blue loctite and another set of bar end weights *facepalm*, cleaning and painting rusty parts of the frame and subframe, bending back the subframe and footbrake/gear lever (1hr).


That was all done over the course of 1.5 yrs as I was studying and a bit ill for a while. The costs come to about £3-400, so for a bike that was free it was worth it. It all really depends on what you are willing to put in and what bike you want, if you want a cheap shitter then you can get a working xj600 for about £600 and it makes less sense to buy it cheap and broken, if you are after a fireblade then by all means by an older version and fix it at your leisure. 


Of course the experience and satisfaction you will gain from taking a basket case and getting it back on the road again is worth more than what you will spend. Little has made me smile more than when I took a bike deemed to be scrap, pointed it at a stretch of straight road and wound the throttle wide open.


My experience was that it took time, it was sometimes frustrating and expensive and that I did do some damage that wasn't needed (I prefer getting a feel for using wrenches to a buying torque wrench) but now that I have done it I don't think I will ever be needing to consult a garage to get my bike fixed - which is great considering I'm a broke student. 


The downside is that as a penniless student this was all done in the garden with no cover - it was either cold, wet and miserable or I ended up with sunburn.

I think we have all overlooked the GK position now that Mignolet has found his form again, but what if he was to get injured next season? Our top priority should probably, at least, be a decent back up keeper, so we don't have Brad Jones in between the posts if Mignolet is injured or drops in form again. 

GK: Perin or Neto - both very good goalkeepers, I doubt we would be able to sign Perin with Juve on their knees for him, but Neto would be a very good back up for Migs.

&gt;

&gt;[Liverpool Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.), an English professional association football club, is Britain's most successful team in [Union of European Football Associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, they have won eleven European trophies: the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) (formerly known as the European Cup) five times, the [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League) (formerly known as the UEFA Cup) three times, and the [UEFA Super Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup) three times.

&gt;Qualification for European competitions is determined by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the [1985 European Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_European_Cup_Final), the occasion of the [Heysel Stadium disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster), following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons. Since being readmitted in 1991, they have qualified for the Champions League (the successor to the European Cup) eight times and the UEFA Cup (the predecessor to the Europa League) seven times.

&gt;As a result of their victory in the [2005 UEFA Champions League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_UEFA_Champions_League_Final), Liverpool won the [European Champion Clubs' Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Champion_Clubs%27_Cup) trophy outright, and were awarded a [multiple winner badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_badge_of_honour). Only [Real Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.) (ten) and [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan) (seven) have won the competition on more occasions. Liverpool's total of three UEFA Cup wins has been matched only by [Internazionale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Internazionale_Milano), [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) and [Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC). They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on three occasions, a total only Milan (five) and [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona) (four) have bettered.

Davis was . . . shit to be honest. He works hard especially tracking back so I can see why we need him in the side but we could do with an upgrade in that position. A great squad player but if we want to keep playing at this level and Europe we need a better first choice.

K Davis isn't good enough. It was fun seeing him pull out some stops over the last few weeks but he really isn't. Forster would have stopped a least one.

Unemployment has been reduced whether you like it or not, you can't argue that. I hope you're not seriously trying to say that the government raised the leaving age to create an illusion of lower unemployment are you?

He's a central midfielder. He defends and attacks. He's most certainly not there to be a third central defender but slightly further up like Coquelin. It's not like Coquelin is even an entirely defensive midfielder. If you're going to slap an acronym on there, it's a CM. 

That is the position that a player assumes when they are on the pitch. Playing defensively is a tactic, not a position.

But to get to the point, Schneiderlin is a damn good central midfielder. But he also gets far too strung out if left by himself in the middle of the park, and his temper shows if he's not getting the help he wants. I'm terrified of him going to Arsenal and suffering the same injury problems that most of their midfielders face, honestly.

Integration is a 2-way street and we need to ensure that Muslims who make an effort to integrate are seen as real Brits, not as 2nd class citizens. I think overall we are better at accepting Muslims than most other European countries and that we already treat them pretty well. The far-right in this country are comparatively weak compared to the mainland. 

I honestly think that the actual amount of real Islamophobia in this country is very low. Those that yell ""deport all muslims, ban all mosques"" are such a small group that they are statistically irrelevant, and we are also not afraid to call them out for being bigots as well. And recently it got to the point in the press where any criticism of an individual person that happens to be Muslim can be written off as bigotry/islamophobia, that isn't right. Islamophobia as a word is practically useless now because its meaning has been diluted so much by ""human rights groups"" like CAGE and the press. 

As far as Saudi Arabia goes, I don't have much hope for it as a country. The dictatorship that runs it currently is actually more moderate and ""progressive"" than its populace. That doesn't bode well for when if/when the country gets some form of democracy. It's an area that was a backwater region even during the Islamic Golden Age. There are some forward thinking people from Saudi Arabia, but they are certainly not the majority.
At least its Shia counterpart Iran could be a rational, reasonable country if the people of Iran were allowed to rule themselves.

There are circumstances when a caution for unsporting behaviour is required
when a player deliberately handles the ball, e.g. when a player:

• deliberately and blatantly handles the ball to prevent an opponent gaining
possession

• attempts to score a goal by deliberately handling the ball

A player is sent off, however, if he prevents a goal or an obvious goalscoring
opportunity by deliberately handling the ball. This punishment arises not from
the act of the player deliberately handling the ball but from the unacceptable

Glasgow was founded in the 15th century. Lancaster was one of a number of institutions that were given university status in the 1960s. 

None of this means the quality of the teaching is going to be better or worse, but a degree from Glasgow will look better on a CV. I would not expect prospective employers to look at subject league tables or requirements . I certainly don't. 

Requirements might be considered to be reflective of the quality of the course, but they are probably a better indicator of supply of university places and demand for those places. 

I really don't mean to be disparaging to Lancaster or anyone who went there, but unless there is something very special about the course (and keep in mind the specifics of an UG course can change a lot without consultation from year to year) or the town, I would always recommend someone attend the uni that is generally considered better.

The UK does have relatively low productivity. It is wrong to say this is because of lower wages however.

I did a bachelors at Lancaster and liked it enough to came back to do a masters. Overall, it is a solid university, if not an exceptional one, but I don't know Glasgow to compare it to. However the business school seems to be doing something right judging by its international prestige - as evidenced by the number of foreign students (especially from Asia) who came over to do their MBA there.

My biggest word of warning about Lancaster is the size of the city. The best word I can think to describe it is ""cosy"".

Fast forward to around Christmas, and he'd completely changed my mind. We were now playing the West Ham way, with extremely attractive, attacking football, and that was bearing fruit in terms of results. He'd convinced me he'd changed his ways, and I was both surprised and impressed.

At Christmas though, our tactics regressed completely, going back to extremely negative long ball tactics, often with no attacking ambition to actually take the game to the opposition.

So I'm in favour of getting rid of Big Sam. We're a club that has a well-known philosophy of playing attractive attacking football, even if we do it terribly. There's a lot of wiggle room in that, you can be direct, you can be patient, it can be possession based, it can be on the counter, it can be on the flanks with wing play or through the middle with a playmaker. From the start of the season to Christmas, we saw that with Big Sam, but before and after we have seen the exact opposite, and at this point, whilst I'm extremely thankful for him getting us up and keeping us in the Premier League, I feel like he is damaging the soul of the club",null,0,null,1429972717,null,0,false,0,cqo8w52,null,t3_33tjmd,null,t1_cqo8w52,null,t3_33tjmd,null,null,null,1432596190,null,12,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,12,null

Unfortunately Mr Big Mouth couldn't get this through his head. Mourinho wanted to get rid of Ba, but had to reject Arsenal's loan offer when Lukaku kicked up a fuss and wanted out. 

The striker position being what it was is exactly the reason he should've stuck around. He had a 32 yo coming in from wilderness (that took time to hit his stride, as time proved), Ba (who the manager wanted to get rid off) and Torres (who was and continued to be, Torres). If he cannot be confident about his chances against these guys (once again, when he has been trusted to contribute already), he has no business being anywhere near a top club.

Happens to all bikes. Then tension causes the chain to slowly stretch.  
It's an easy fix: the real wheel is designed to be adjustable. And it's standard wear and tear on a bike.

Tools:

* start off with a toolset that has a range of spanners and sockets. Halfords Advanced are usually a good price, good quality and come with lifetime warranty.  
You'll be looking for sizes up to about 22mm to be safe [but most of the time, you'll only need up to 19mm]  

* A set of screwdrivers is handy, as can be allan keys [bike dependent].  

* If you can stretch it, get a torque wrench. 18""-24"" breaker bars can be useful too.

* If you've not got a centre stand on the bike, paddock stands can be handy too.

* mulitimeter can be useful for diagnosing electrical problems.

* A ball pein hammer and impact driver [for when bolts are over-torqued, and the breaker bar doesn't even shift them]

* pliers and grips

* a good torch - you can usually get appropriate ones in halfords and the like. Ones that sit on a stand.

* a small stool... (:

The problem is what it will do to the country if this moaning becomes a big enough political issue to illicit change.

As we are doing stories....I grew up in a poor rural place in the south west in a working class household (initially just my mum bringing me up in a council flat). The area is full of unemployment and hardly anyone has drive or ambition. Yet I did well at school, went to a good uni and now have a house in London. I got here by a lot of luck. I look back at the people where I grew up and feel sorry for them, they were born in an environment that perpetuated underachieving and laziness. Of course they moan, being poor is crap, but they don't know the options available or the world out there. The system fails them. We should inspire and entice them but not criticise them.

That is strawman argument you are attacking. I already said the concept exists ONLY it is unjustified. I can clarify by pointing out where this strawman goes. See you also say.

'You're making normative assumptions, we're talking about what race and democracy are, not what they ought to be or what they are in a moral sense.'

This is a strawman. Why? I am talking about epistemology ; justified true belief. So the normative element isn't relevant. You keep saying social constructs exist in peoples heads... well no shit sherlock! I am questioning if the belief's are justified or not. I say race is an unjustified belief which people like yourself hold. 

Now the one thing you said that is relevant 'The rest of your post is essentially lewontin's fallacy, just because we have a large genetic variation doesn't mean that humans can't be divided in a taxonomic way.'

Agreed, humans could be divided in a taxonomic way. However unless l see evidence that this is the case, what justification do I have to accept that? I avoid the fallacy by giving you or anyone else the opportunity to provide evidence. Telling me race is a social construct isn't good enough, as I could taxonomically generate races based on eye colour, body types, hair colour (say I declare gingers are a race) etc. It would get out of hand if I could generate my own constructs. There needs to be something to justify this taxonomy.

null,false,jjjjorde,flair2,,null,"Because often his strengths don't lie in the most obvious of phases in football. I personally really like Mason and I feel that being his first season people are very quick to scrutinize him. At the face of it Mason was playing League One football last year, and the likes of Paulinho and Dembele have had years playing top-flight football. For players of their calibre and experience failing to make the greatest impact consistently subsequently results in them not making the starting Eleven.
 
Mason constantly works whilst on the pitch, playing deep to win the ball back. There were numerous instances to which he won the ball deep in our half and that instigated an attack; Similar to the assist for Townsend in his first England game. In terms of his shooting, Mason hit the incredible shot that won him his place in the team against Forest, and that is one of the stand-out moments of the season. With the potential of hitting shots like this, it shows confidence. In that game against Forest we played absolutely fucking awful, we were on the edge of being knocked out, with Mason coming on the whole complexity of the game changed.

Mason has this ability and I feel that just because he doesn’t score consistently or play that cutting edge pass to the striker almost allows him to go under the radar. I think he seems to offer more in elements than the other two do, he provides a more attacking presence at times than Paulinho, and more of a defensive edge over Dembele. I am *not* saying that he is better than the others at all, and I am *not* saying the other two are better than him. I think at the end of the day he **slipped**. Yes, he shouldn't have turned inside and yes he should have quickly dispersed the ball but the fault is as much his as it is Lloris' and Davies.


I am not arguing with you, or trying to convince you or anyone else to like him or sowhat, but I think that a major factor is his workrate and how he suits Pochettino's demanding system perfectly.

&gt;Mourinho wanted to get rid of Ba, but had to reject Arsenal's loan offer

Mourinho [didn't want to strengthen Arsenal after they got Ozil](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea/jose-mourinho-admits-chelsea-blocked-demba-bas-move-to-arsenal-after-gunners-mesut-ozil-signing-29552064.html), and then he's left with 4 strikers for 1 position. Torres couldn't be sold, Eto'o was just bought, and Demba Ba wasn't being loaned out. Only course of action was loaning Lukaku as he needed the mins for his development. 

That's just the thing, he was confident in his abilities but not that they would play the best striker. Rather, he felt that they would play whoever cost the most (Torres, as we saw for years prior), or the Manager's woobie (Eto'o) or a proven veteran striker (Ba). Chelsea isn't exactly a club that shows much faith in unproven youngsters to start week in week out. But then like I said, the club was never going to just stay with that strikeforce and not improve it, and enter Diego Costa. What then? You think if he stayed he would've been the starting striker for a team challenging for English and European glory? Don't be naïve.

Fanboys here can't get over him? Lol more like people can't stop invoking his name unnecessarily all the time. It's pathetic how a lot of fans on here act like bitter exes despite the fact that WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN HIM/HIS TEAM. It's so petty to see him still get shit on so hard here. If anyone needs to get over it, it's people like you.

Even if you have signed an employment contract you may not be entitled to anything except maybe pay for whatever notice period is stated in the contract.

You could be slightly cheeky and write directly to the CEO/owner of the company stating that you have incurred significant costs and expenses by leaving your previous employer in order to take on a position which no longer exists within their organization,  and to graciously ask if they would, as a gesture of goodwill, offer to help cover some of those expenses. 

Make it 100% clear that you understand that they are under no obligation to do so, but their decision to rescind their offer of employment has put you in a difficult place financially. Briefly explain the circumstances but try not to sound in any way whiney.

Finally, I'd end the letter by stating that whether they decide to help you out or not you hope that you letter doesn't jeopardise your chances at future employment with the company and that you'd still be happy to work there no matter their decision.

---

This option has obvious risks attached. If they were serious about keeping your name on file for future positions then it may burn your bridges.

The number of food bank users has risen from ~60,000 to ~1,000,000 (link: http://www.trusselltrust.org/stats) so even if you assumed that every new zero-hours contracts worker is using a food bank, ~600,000 people (total zeros workers - total before 2010, link: http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/25/zero-hours-contract-rise-staff-figures) theres still around 400,000 people unaccounted for. So if the Government has created 1.8million jobs and using your assumption that those 600,000 zero-contracts workers are on food banks who are the other ~400,000 people? Are they Nigel's 'dirty foreigners'? Natalie's 'eco-hippies'? Nicola's 'oppressed Scotsmen'? Don't forget the ~1.2million in work and better off than they were in unemployment as well.

If the number actually matched then you'd have a point, but they don't and therefore you don't. Yes, under the Tories we have seen the poorest hit hardest but the poorest will always be hit hardest during economic turmoil because they have the least means to cope.

This is why people have a disdain for 'the left' they try to bring up an important issue but don't have anything to show where the problem is or how to fix it.

He was with the team for like 4 or 5 games before he went out on loan and played in all but 1 or 2, I believe. I don't think youth players, unless they've proven themselves beyond a doubt, deserve to be given the first choice role automatically. They should be humble, know their situation and show they can fit in with the first team when given the chance. I firmly believe if he stayed, he would have been the first choice striker after a while and we might not have bought Costa. Especially after the whole Mourinho rant last year about how his strikers can't score.

You might say, ""What about Courtois?"" That situation is completely different to me. I think he definitely proved himself after he became a top 5 keeper in the world with a ton of experience at the ripe age of just 22. Goalkeeper is also the easiest position to transition going from one club to another, so there's a much lower, basically non-existent, risk of Courtois of not working out. Plus, we could have lost him to literally any big club in the world if we didn't guarantee him a starting role. Lukaku did well with West Brom and Everton, but there's a difference between playing for those two clubs and Chelsea. It's a completely different because obviously the system is different and the teams defend Chelsea much more differently than they defend West Brom or Everton. There's no guarantee he would work out, so it's silly to guarantee a first choice role IMO.",null,1,null,1429977154,null,0,false,0,cqoauxs,null,t3_33ss8e,null,t1_cqoauxs,null,t1_cqoaaxc,null,null,null,1432597187,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

This is why (pre-2007) our share of debt as a % of GDP shrank under Labour despite running a deficit in almost every year. 

Think of it like this: you owe £10k, but you earn £20k, not really a problem. Then you lose your job,  problem. The best solution is to get another job,  not to sell all your possessions to pay down your debt. Remember most people run a debt many many times their yearly income (mortgages alone do this). We're currently at 80% of GDP a bit like owing £16k on your £20k salary (GDP isn't quite income but I'm trying to make it simple). 

As for how much is too much, no one's really sure, but as the money markets are still lending to us on very good terms were certainly not there yet and other countries (and us in the past) have run far higher debt with no issues. 

What the ratings agencies want is GDP growth,  that's why when growth stopped at the start of this parliament we lost our AAA rating.

It's not a stretch at all. Playing at Everton/WBA and playing at Chelsea are different things - and when the manager gave him minutes straightaway it's a fantastic opportunity but also a pressure situation; especially the Villa game which was won by a solitary goal late on IIRC. Also, well done for completely ignoring the Super Cup ... but of course that's just a ''glorified friendly'' because it doesn't suit your narrative.

&gt; This is another thing people often get backwards:
&gt; Mourinho wanted to get rid of Ba, but had to reject Arsenal's loan offer
&gt; Mourinho didn't want to strengthen Arsenal after they got Ozil, and then he's left with 4 strikers for 1 position. Torres couldn't be sold, Eto'o was just bought, and Demba Ba wasn't being loaned out. Only course of action was loaning Lukaku as he needed the mins for his development.

Actually it's you who's got it completely backwards. Of course Mourinho's going to provide an explanation that's palatable to a player he's now reluctantly keeping. Lukaku's bitchfit brought about those two moves, not the other way round. He demanded the loan, which he admitted later on after lying about it - which again you'll ignore because it doesn't go along with your view.

Where does Costa even come into this? He could have seized his chance (which Eto'o and Torres actually ended up providing to Ba as the season wore on) and put himself in Remy's position this year.

I couldn't care less about Lukaku, I stopped giving a shit when he did. But yes, I'll keep mentioning the actual reasons when guys here try and revise history.

2. You have no real idea how to tell if a person is a Muslim or not
3. So you just abuse people who look Muslim

&gt;You said Rodgers needs more time, so why not give it to him? 

Because we're fading into obscurity and it's quite upsetting. We don't have the time required for Brendan to take that next step and be able to attract the best names. That's done on the European stage (the UCL), something we won't have next season. We're in a limbo where we're better than Saints/Spurs but not as good as the current top 4. It's time to decide where we want to be. Wait any longer and the bridge to top 4 becomes longer. 

&gt; Why do people on here feel like we're entitled to get ""world class"" manager like Klopp? I'm sure there will be many other (and yes, more attractive) suitors when the summer arrives. 
 
Klopp has stated how he always wanted to manage in England and how he's more of a romantic. City want pep, and are prepared to wait. United have LVG and arsenal have Wenger who is finally free to spend and build his team without financial constraint. Who does that leave? 

&gt;With all of the process we've made, it would be a huge mistake to just toss a big part of it away like that
 
No one is throwing away progress. Klopp would love our squad. He's got the personality and the charisma to unite a divided fanbase. He's world class and we'd be silly to not try and get him.

null,false,conchobor,null,null,null,"I have several problems with Rodgers, and I certainly don't think the criticism towards him on this sub is a joke. I think a lot of it is relatively warranted. 

Tactically, he's simply not as good as he thinks he is, and using Allardyce terminology here, he's been ""out tactic-ed"" several times this season by lesser managers of lesser clubs. Often times, his substitutions are questionable and ineffective, and sometimes, he doesn't even use them, or at least not until its too late for the subs to make a difference. 

His transfers have been godawful for the most part. I simply don't trust him with money anymore. Everyone the club has brought in has been either mostly poor/average, or we massively overpaid for them, with the exception of Sturridge, Coutinho, Sakho, and Emre Can. And if the rumors are true, those were all committee signings, and not Rodgers'. 

I also don't think his man management is nearly as good as people claim it is. Say what you want about Balotelli, but I think its fairly obvious that Rodgers has misused him and almost isolated him. And going back a ways here, his decision to move Agger on is highly questionable. Even further back, I still can't believe he got Nuri Sahin to come here, and then played him relatively little, out of position, and then let him leave halfway through the season. I'm sure there are other examples, but thats just a few off the top of my head. 

And lastly, I think its fairly obvious he can't motivate the team at this point in the season. I think this is exacerbated by his post-game remarks. Doesn't matter how shit the team play, he thinks they played excellent. 

I support the club, I support the players, and I even support Rodgers, but the criticism of him on here is definitely not a joke.

Lambert wasn't on the bench so I don't know what you're on about there.

It's not like we weren't going wide at all, but Can, Sterling, Johnson and Ibe couldn't produce. There were comments during half time that wondered if we were ignoring Balo, but we were just spreading it wide and waiting for him to make a good run in the box. Once Lallana came on and he played some clever 1-2s with Cou and Sterling we found some penetration out wide.

Borini had a couple decent touches in the box and generally showed more presence than Balo. Why is Balo getting in positions for pullbacks when he's surrounded by 8 WBA players?

Due to the small size of counties compared to US states and their massive interdependence on each other I would have a bet on something like the old Anglo Saxon Heptarchy re-emerging, with the southwestern counties forming something like Wessex, and Norfolk and Suffolk reuniting into East Anglia.

Also, at some point during the war the fens would be re-flooded, submerging large parts of southern Lincolnshire and bits of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, separating the kingdoms of East Anglia and Lindsey.

Also, something about Cornish independence.

However, you CAN stick to the outside the whole way around, as with horses, but this REALLY fucking annoys drivers, understandably.  Real Cycles up past Comber do bike maintenance courses, it's a good starting point and covers most of what you'll need to know.  Bike tools vary between manufacturers but a good hex key set will be a must!  I think that's all points covered, I would recommend you get insurance too. Mine cost £60 for the year and covers me for everything whether my fault or not.   I am covered for crashes with cars and ppedestrians, it also covers my bike off road and protects against theft.

Famished laborers were also prohibited from seeking relief until ""it was certified that they had become indigent, destitute and capable of only a modicum of labour.""

I'm obviously not that familiar with their situation but i'd say the only way we don't overtake them next season is with either a second renaissance by Yaya Toure along with Aguero carrying them to fourth, or by selling Toure, Aguero, Jovetic ect (i.e. those with resale value) and rebuilding their side focused on Silva and Fernandinho with some inspired signings. Either way I don't think it's likely that they play well next season.

Onto the game today, fair enough his natural movement is to look for a pullback, but with some of the crosses today it wouldn't have mattered if he was surrounded in the box if he had positioned himself well. All he needs to do is create havoc by contesting the crosses. Obviously easier said than done, but if he can't get on the end of some crosses we have so many runners coming in who can get on the end of a knockdown from an aerial challenge. A player like Balotelli should know how to create a nuisance of himself aerially in the box for a cross, he's 1.89m and a big unit. Lallana's crosses late in the game reached Borini alright.

It's a catch 22. Pakistani communities started off as workers. They were poor. But you need wealth to breed education and an ethos of education. 

Pakistani and Indians are culturally similar until 1947. They split then. There are regional differences and obviously a pashtun is different from a Tamil. However along the border they have the same cultures. 

So what's the difference. Well? It's the same difference between the poorer Malaysian Indians and the Indians in the UK. One's a super rich minority, the other is super poor minority. The ""winning"" ways of Indians in the UK due to hard work and a pathological fear of debt are different to Indians in Malaysia. 

Why? Sources. Indians in the UK were Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers and Scientists. Or in Business. People who were either educated or had the wealth to spend on education. Pakistani workers were usually labourers or factory workers. Indians in Malaysia were indebtured labourers and slaves taken over to run Rubber Farms.

* Bike Lock and Chain: [Oxford set](http://www.infinitymotorcycles.com/product/oxford-boss-disc-lock-with-free-15m-chain/4371)

My biggest recommendation is to go to a store and try stuff on to make sure you are comfortable with it. The Alpinestar Andes kit was recommended to me as the best weather kit you can get for the price. I can also recommend using Infinity because the prices are ok and you can get cash back with their membership card. It means a free pair of gloves after you buy your initial kit and chain cleaner and everything else. I also highly recommend getting boots that have zips or buckles instead of just laces to make it quicker getting them on and off if you are commuting.

Insurance for a new rider can be expensive for full coverage £600+ in some cases so be ready for that depending on your past driving record. Although Liability only can be up to about half that. 

I hope this helps and good luck with the riding.",null,0,null,1429984795,null,0,false,0,cqoen1u,null,t3_33t2nz,null,t1_cqoen1u,null,t1_cqo560z,null,null,null,1432598969,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

offenders in the community, using the latest technology to
keep criminals on the straight and narrow. And we must
also become smarter when it comes to crime prevention,

“We will provide experts in courts and police stations to identify where mental health or a drug problem is behind an offender’s behaviour so they can be dealt with in a way that is appropriate. We will pilot US-style drug and alcohol courts.”

9.8 An effective approach to reducing drug harm

For too long the debate about effective ways to reduce the harm caused by drugs has been distorted by political prejudice. Around the world, countries are trialling new approaches that are reducing drug harm, improving lives, reducing addiction and saving taxpayers’ money. In the UK we have made good progress on treatment but we continue to give 80,000 people a year a criminal record for drug possession, blighting their employment chances, and we still imprison 1,000 people a year for personal possession when they are not charged with dealing or any other offence.

We will:

* Adopt the approach used in Portugal where those arrested for possession of drugs for personal use are diverted into treatment, education or civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record.

* As a first step towards reforming the system, legislate to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use, diverting resources towards tackling organised drug crime instead.

* Continue to apply severe penalties to those who manufacture, import or deal in illegal drugs, and clamp down on those who produce and sell unregulated chemical highs.

* Establish a review to assess the effectiveness of the cannabis legalisation experiments in the United States and Uruguay in relation to public health and criminal activity.

* Legislate to make the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs independent in setting the classification of drugs, while remaining accountable to Parliament and the wider public. 

* Enable doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use.

* Put the Department of Health rather than the Home Office in charge of drug policy.

You can have the name Hussein and be black or white, and people will assume you are a Muslim based on it. Just like people will assume Cohens are Jewish. It's nothing to do with your race. The reason people think Obama is a Muslim is partly because of that, and also because some of his family are Muslims. He was best man at his brother's Muslim wedding, where he married the first of his twelve wives. His brother is an open supporter of Islamic terrorism and Barrack is still in touch with him.

I'm sure future generations will look back on us thinking that we were barbarians too, the fact is; it was a different time and Britain was probably the fairest and least bloodthirsty empire in history (unless you count present day USA as an empire in which case that title goes to the US). 

The creation of infrastructure which many nations still rely on today, investments in schools, railways, roads etc. In India we wiped out the Thuggee death cults that had been responsible for murdering millions of people and life expectancy increased by 50 percent under British rule. We introduced an early form of democracy to a land pretty much entirely based on primogeniture. The fact is most post independence governing powers of most ex colonial nations have treated their denizens worse than Britain ever did.

Again, not attempting to excuse the atrocities, just bringing to light the oft-ignored genuine good. I mean, I assume you knew about at least some of this stuff, but still.

* Glasgow undergraduate system is a lot closer to US system where you can pick and choose your honours degree until pretty late into the game. My friend's sister couldn't choose whether to concentrate on physics, chemistry or maths until end of third year/start of fourth. If you choose Lancaster or other English uni, you can't really change your degree (major).

* Glasgow is a big city with over a million people. Lancaster is a town with 140k.

* Glasgow uni also has a sizeable American student population.

* If you want old historic-looking university, Glasgow is it.

* Even if you definitely can't transfer your college credits, you can probably substitute a number of modules, e.g. more difficult ones.

* Lancaster business school is amongst the top tier of UK institutions for business. In some subjects, they're number 1 or 2, like Operational Research.

* However, every Lancaster alumni I've talked to hated the town and couldn't wait to study their masters in London.

* Being a Russell Group university means nothing to an undergraduate as that's more about funding and research.

* Any plans to study abroad in the penultimate year? Check out who they have a reciprocal study exchange with anyway, particularly the US. Usually a good indicator of where they rank in the world :)

* In the UK, business is deemed as a 'soft' undergraduate subject so it might be a good idea to do a joint honours degree which Glasgow offers. It could be anything as long as regulation and timetable permits e.g. Spanish, Computer Science, Geography etc.

* If you're dead set on studying BBA, then go for Lancaster. They have a reputation to protect so the department will be helpful for you to look for a job in the UK and the placement year is always good.

* If you have intention to go back to the US, then Glasgow would be a better brand.",null,0,null,1429985280,null,0,false,0,cqoew6m,null,t3_33sohn,null,t1_cqoew6m,null,t1_cqo7zc9,null,null,null,1432599088,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

null,false,nonpareilpearl,null,null,null,"&gt; Do you know why the US health care system is overpriced and sucks? 

It's a massive, somewhat complicated problem. 

Part of the problem is we've made our healthcare system so damn complicated that I don't think anyone knows how to navigate it fully. This means that there are teams of people to handle even relatively simple billing issues.

Another part of the problem is how we treat: we don't tend to look for the ""lowest common denominator"". Recent example for me: I presented with unexplained dizziness that I had been experiencing with increasing severity over 10 days - it had started when I had been traveling for work (but stayed within the US). It also started, as my GP (I believe what you call ""general practitioner"" we call ""primary care dr"") knew, around the time my period started (this should have been a clue, especially for women). During this time I had experienced increased difficulty sleeping - and didn't sleep for four consecutive days at the end of it. I was given a med for dizziness (which I didn't take, because I don't like taking non-emergency meds to treat something with an unknown cause). Blood work was run for my thyroid, but I didn't have any thyroid issue-like symptoms (and thyroid issues have to be pretty severe, as I understand it, to appear on blood work - this is no way an ""early detection"" method). I was also sent to a neurologist and appointments were scheduled for me to have various neurological tests run - including an MRI. My fiancée, who as I mentioned in another comment here is terminal ill but was also pre-med before falling ill and is the daughter of a surgeon, said the entire thing was ridiculous and told me to ask my GP to run my Vitamin D and an Iron panel. (I didn't ask her why - we've been together long enough I Just trust her judgement.) And there was my issue, plain as day. I was severely anemic with Fe and Hemoglobin less than half the ""low norm"" and my Vit D was incredibly low as well. 

So to treat anemia, we jumped through a ton of neuro hoops before even looking for something that's a pretty common issue for menstruating females. The only test that revealed useful information were the tests my *fiancée* asked for. Everything else (IMO) was serious overkill on the part of my GP/etc. I have no idea how long it would have taken them to figure out why I was dizzy had she not suggested they look at those levels. o.O A very needlessly expensive issue. 

I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in my experience: we've had stuff like this happen repeatedly over the course of my fiancée's illness and the illnesses of her friends (we have made friends in the local community through support groups for her diagnosis).

Another factor in our cost of healthcare, as was pointed out, is that we are sue happy. Malpractice costs for drs in the US are exorbitantly high and drs have to be savvy with their finances to protect their investments. Otherwise, one lawsuit gone badly wrong could leave them and their families paupers.

And this is only the surface.

As an aside, I had really mixed feelings about what is nicknamed ""Obamacare"" in the US for this and a few other reasons. My top three issues with Obamacare were:

* It was a very ""feel good"" system in the sense that it was supposed to, effectively, outline the path to universal healthcare. Without fixing our healthcare system enough to handle that burden.
* The bill was so long that many of the elected representatives who were voting on the bill would say in interviews that they didn't read it to completion - sometimes even said it with a tinge of pride, because they had better things to do. (Like what, I wonder. Certainly not representing us.) A bill so long that the average person cannot read and parse the information is useless and prevents constructive dialog about its pros and cons., which leads me to...
* ...my last reason: there was very little debate about Obamacare before it was passed. Not to say there were not a ton of WORDS, mind you. But since so few of the elected officials read the bill, and you can bet less than 10% of their constituents did, there was no dialog that was actually constructive to make sure Obamacare was structured in a way that would actually *repair* our healthcare system.

Given how long it took him to renew his contract last time, I suspect he probably wants quite high wages. But he hasn't had a great season, and if he can get higher wages elsewhere, I wouldn't be surprised to see the club let him leave.

Jems been unlucky with injuries over the last few years. I'd like him to stay, but the club might decide he's not worth keeping if he's going to spend long periods out.

Feds is a great keeper at this level, and i'd love for him to stay. If we're going to have any chance of pushing for the playoffs next season we're going to need a keeper of his quality.

&gt;Despite standing for election on a divisive communalist ticket and being backed by the far-right Islamist Forum of Europe (IFE), support on the far-left for Britain’s first Muslim Mayor was remarkably strong. Some even claimed that Lutfur Rahman was a socialist, despite his support base being made up of George Galloway’s Respect party, wealthy local restaurateurs and the IFE. Hardly the Socialist International, is it?

I mean how does this happen, I'm going to randomly speculate with nothing to back it up.   I think it's about in-groups and out-groups, for a long time since back in the 80's there was a sort of alliance between Muslim and other ethnic minority groups, socialists and Trotskyists etc who were fighting very real racism at the time and the Conservative government's attempts to roll back effective unions and other aspects of the social democratic consensus etc; perhaps this had a particular character in London with figures like rahman. 

Maybe these relationships may have kind of functioned like a patronage system and perhaps  influenced who large sections of the socialist left see as morally deserving. Also from the 60's the acceptance of various identatiarian nationalisms as legitimate parts of the left/socialist program (when they were often not particularly socialist or progressive themselves) have also played a part. But this seems like it has a lot of reflexive 'us v them' about it.

For me the day went a little like this;

Arrived at 8:45 for a 9am start, had a brew and a bit of a chat while people turned up. Had my documents checked and all that jazz, settled my bill. 

Next bit was a gear-briefing where they explained the various types of gear- leathers/textiles etc. Showed us helmets, explained the various helmets and fitting.

We then got sized up for some gear, tried bits and bobs on, got a feel for size. Then we went out to the cbt area, which was basically a closed off carpark, about 20 meters by 10 meters. 

To begin with, we got shown what all the buttons and levers did, and then had a walk with the bikes, using the front brake to stop the bike at walking pace so we could get a feel for braking.  

Next bit was starting up the bikes, getting a feel for the throttle. We then got told to put the bikes into 1st gear and find the biting point. We then drove 1 car parking space using the clutch and very little throttle, then broke, this then scaled up until we did the whole length of the paddock. 

Then we did some circuits, still only in first gear, we then scaled this bit up to include gear changes. The instructor then told us to start checking shoulders and indicating as we were coming up to turn.

We then did some figure of 8's and emergency stops.

After a while, he put some cones out as a mock-up junction, so we would do the circuit, then treat the junction as a real junction, stopping, looking both ways, checking mirrors, indicating, and moving off. 

Then the best bit - Lunch.

After lunch we went out on the road ride where they gave us an earpiece so we could listen to instructions but not speak back. We went for about 20 minutes, pulled over, got some feedback, then went back out. Repeated this a few times, before I knew it, the 2 hours had flown by and we were back at the test centre where they completed our certificates and explained next steps to me for booking my DAS.

Hope that helps.

And for that matter, the score is irrelevant. Unless, as I said, you were happy with that standard of performance, in which case, you're probably supporting the wrong club.

I'm pretty sure I speak for most supporters when I say that, although results are obviously important, if we had put in a good performance against WBA (perhaps the keeper had a blinder, perhaps we were unlucky with decisions from the officials etc etc) then people would have a lot less potential to complain.

There is a time in your season (and success) that supporters can start complaining when they don't win every game; that's not the position we're in. 

We're in a position where, barring a few months after Christmas where performances levels were higher, we have been consistently poor. Lack of intensity, creativity, goals and ultimately no signs of an actual philosophy or team identity.

The most worrying thing of all is that there seems to be little sign of improvement in any of those respects.

Also, I'm pretty sure that no-one thinks Klopp could have come in, waved a magic wand, and put the ball in the back of the net 3 times. The reason we are discussing the manager's position after a result like this is that we, as fans, have legitimate reasons to worry for the direction and progress our team is making.

It's really got nothing to do with ""Klopp would beat WBA at home"". People are (rightly) frustrated at our current situation and it's clear some of us believe that a new manager in Klopp could really catalyze some much needed positive change in the state of our club.

It is the manager's job to navigate the injuries, to motivate the squad, to plan for tough opponents, to overcome bad luck, to keep his squad focused...

In my opinion the only one to blame is the manager. 2 wins in 17 tries is grounds for dismissal, as the manager clearly has not done the job.

Over this season we lost 50 odd goals in our two main strikers. Suarez is gone, Daniel is made out of wet paper and our striker recruitment has failed.

Without a striker able to score more than 5 goals in the PL we sit in 5th place. Spurs who last season spent roughly the same amount of money like we did this summer are level on points with us whilst having a 20 goals a season striker in Harry Kane. 

**Fifth place is currently where we belong.**


We cannot attract big name players because 

- we are not a top 4 club anymore, haven't been that for a long time
- we do not pay wages like a top 4 club does
- we cannot guarentee CL football

The mistakes have been made at the start of the season. Letting Suarez go has done so much damage to the club it is probably in a worse state now than it's been when Rodgers took over. 
To the outside world, we are a selling club. We let talents play and when they are about to hit or are at their peak we cannot hold on to them. 

This is down to FSGs philosophy of buying loads of young/talented players and hoping that they peak at the same time to challenge for titles. 
The first phase of this has failed miserably. We should have our first batch of top-class players right now. Allen and Henderson, even Coutinho and Sturridge (to a lesser extent) should all be a lot better than they are right now. 

Moreno, Markovic, Sterling, Can, Ibe. Will they reach their potential? Will they stay if they do? 

The ""proven"" buys this summer have also not worked out. 
Lovren and Lallana were reportedly Rodgers' calls. While Lovren had a good game today he has largely been a failure and Lallana, well he's been injured. Rodgers is to blame there no argument. With the money for the two saints we could have done much better. 

Then Balotelli stands for everything wrong with the transfer committee. Buying cheap, based on stats. The ohyoubeauty blog posted an analysis in preseason showing why Balotelli is not going to work out in our system. Yet on here everyone was so fucking happy that we signed a NAME. 

*""He scored XY amount of goals in Serie A""*

*""Ya, and it's so hard to score in Italy""*

*""Totally, he's gonna be a hit""*

Fuck off.

Lastly, Rodgers is a stubborn and young tactician. We as fans might have overstated his genius last season, but there is no denying that he is an incredibly talented coach and i truly believe he will win titles in his managing career. 

The 343 did not come by accident. He tried a few formations to give a team missing its two biggest outputs of goals an edge and he succeeded. Yes, we lost against United and Arsenal. Yes, we will miss out on top 4. But again we can't compete with them in our current state.

Özil, Alexis, Di Maria, Rooney, Cazorla, Ramsey, Mata, De Gea, Van Persie. 

These players would walk right into our starting eleven no discussion whatsoever. 

It is all a matter of expectations. If you want to blame all of this on Rodgers than fine. But there is more at fault than a flawed  manager.

Various Iraqi groups. Get out of Iraq. 

ISIL? Formation of a state in backlash to the perceived puppet government of the USA. Hell they aren't all that liked either.

The truth is though, in it's current form capitalism constructs wealth through rapid depletion of resources. There's no real way to deny it, in every form some form of resource is being transformed, and turned into wealth, and there is a finite amount of resources on Earth. 

Eventually I think/hope there'll be a crunch point - some kind of international catastrophe/event that catalyses a sort of paradigm shift, and people realise that it can't continue as the status quo and that environmental impacts need to be accounted for somewhere down the line, and that the framework of capitalism needs to change.

See I'm not so sure this part of it is that simple either. I think there is definitely a strong element of resource depletion, but there is also a strong element of resource *transformation,* so rather than strictly a linear conversion of resource --&gt; wealth, the process spins off new technologies via the reinvestment of wealth and the shifting/changing nature of the resource landscape.

How can we say it was an uncomfortable afternoon for the committee and not for Rodgers when Rodgers sits on the committee?

We don't know their beliefs, we don't know their preferences in players or player types, we don't know who has more clout than who and we don't know how influential they are in the decision-making process in Boston. We know the square root of fuck all apart from that they cannot do their jobs competently. 

I've been confused for three years as to why Rodgers would turn down the Liverpool job because he didn't want to work with a traditional director of football, but would turn around and accept it only to be undercut by what amounts to the world's shittest DoF only governed by committee. 

From other sources, it's sounding like if Rodgers does stay he won't have a huge amount of money to spend nor will he have as much of a say in spending it.

How do you fuck up a basic moral judgement like that?

It depends, if the reason Milliband would enforce this is to back up Muslims who don't like those opposing ISIS then it's morally wrong. However somehow i don't think Milliband is an Islamic State sympathiser.

More likely is it's because it's illegal to go abroad to fight in foreign wars. Either you keep that law and apply it to everyone or get rid of it because it's useless. Surely it's morally abject and short sighted that we apply a law to some and not to others? Or should the government be writing up a list of nations/groups you can and can't fight for/against?

Yup - totally agree. But at this point Entropy comes into play and you're still losing energy in the transaction/transformation as not all energy can be recuperated. Fossil fuels have offered a fairly efficient energy method in being a stable, instant form, and it's proving difficult to replace them.

I haven't heard a thing about it in election run up.

Has to stop eventually and then....?

You can't just buy government bonds forever to keep interest rates low, or before you know it, you're in the same boat as Japan. 

As I understand it, and I'm far from an expert, QE pushes up the market price of government bonds and reduces the yield paid out to investors, so investors have to pay more to get the same income.

Which means pension funds are now running a deficit, meaning that they have to buy more bonds just to sustain what the payout level should be.

So bonds become more expensive, and it turns into cycle that ends up imploding on itself eventually. 

I'm sure people on here can and will correct me if I'm wrong, or explain it more clearly.

I'd just like to add something to all these articles flying about. There are quite a few Pagans of various kinds running around NI, and several different established groups. But I've never met anyone but himself and his wife who're in this ""Order of the Golden Rivers."" Perhaps there are more, but I asked around and got the impression that few seem to have heard of this untill relatively recently. 


Personally, I feel this gentleman makes the impression that he likes to be the centre of attention, compared with most folk I know who just want to get on with their business. I've heard that he's already been involved in the odd bit of drama. Having met him at events, I take him with a pinch of salt, especially all this ""Nightrunner"" paleolithic past life stuff.

Take this with a grain of salt because I'm only familiar with the original scheme, I'm not sure if it has changed, but I think the 20% they lend you is equity, not a fixed amount. So you don't just pay it back, you buy it back in either two 10% 'purchases' or one 20% purchase. There will be legal fees involved, which will eat into your return, and also you'll pay more back if the property goes up. There are also restrictions eg. no subletting (even if you get permission from the mortgage company). I did what you're planning to do and I think I'd have been better off not doing, but your situation might be different.  

As for them lending you money in exchange for a %, as far as I'm aware no mortgage company will consider this. You'd need to get a joint mortgage, or they'd have to gift it you (and the solicitor will ask them to sign a form saying it's a gift and they don't expect a % of the property in return). There's nothing to say you *can't* pay them back or give them a % when you sell, but there's not going to be a legal basis for it.

Still, Labour supporters mainly want to stamp out any kind of mention of Miliband's ridiculous appearance (which he's actually managed to do a good job of overcoming, which makes his failures all the worse in the last four years, since it appears he actually does have a personality after all.)

***

From the article: *When his Mainz were promoted to the first division, he took the team for a five-day preseason camping trip at a lake in Sweden. The players were allowed to bring no food and did not even run for fitness training, let alone play with a football. But the experience built toughness and camaraderie.

""We went to the Bundesliga and people could not believe how strong we were,"" said Klopp, per Donald McRae of The Guardian.*

***

I'm not Rogers-out but I just cannot imagine Rodgers doing this sort of thing. Maybe he has or would - certainly has been signs of good comaraderie in the squad. But the more I see and hear about Klopp the more I like the guy. We would be very luck to get him. 



***

From the article: *Klopp is a mentor to his players, the kind of ""cool dad"" character who is half friend, half father figure. His passion inspires players to give everything for the club and to never, ever give up hope. He emphasizes that every game is important and that every goal is special: Rather than showing his team video footage of Barcelona's tiki-taka style of play, he instead uses still photos to illustrate how the Catalan giants celebrate every goal as though it were their first.*

***

I wonder how players like Balo would react to this type of management. 


Reading further it sounds like a lot of the negative criticisms of Klopp's tactics of old could be applied to Liverpool under Rodgers. One-dimensional, ""Dortmund were unable to cope with the added burden of Champions League games while playing at such a high intensity"", ""Klopp's system at Dortmund is not perfect; even with recent adjustments, it remains rather one-dimensional.

The wingback position suited him because he had more space in front of him to really charge at defenders and he wasn't half bad defensively. Made some great recovery runs.
Now he's more accustomed to the league and does a job as a winger. That was a smart move by Rodgers.

Sterlings multiple positions is down to injuries and timing. To good to be left out of the squad, filling in for injured players and so on. 

Misusing Mignolet? How can you misuse a goalie? Migs had a bad run of form. Rodgers dropped him. Gave his usual ""he has to improve"" speech. Migs came back. Been pretty good since. One of Rodgers' player management traits. He's done the same to Downing, Enrique, Shelvey. Not that it was as successful but it's his way of motivating his players to improve. 

Rotating yep i agree, he's horrible at that. 

Substitutions i kind of agree, sometimes there is simply no one on our bench who can change a game but yes when he's had alternatives waiting their turn he uses his substitutions way to late in games. 

Treatment of Balotelli is a matter of opinion. I for one think Rodgers handled him quite well considering Mario is a child trapped in a immensely talented footballer. But that's over next season anyway. I doubt Mario will stay.

So lets start with greater London. In the first 24 hours it has two objectives. Take out the city of London (shear weight of numbers should do that nicely) and invade Berkshire to capture Burghfield and Aldermaston. While the UK's nuclear weapons are largely safely in Scotland it is likely that the two sites contain a few active devices. If it can do that then its got nuclear weapons and enough people to grab anything else it needs in the medium term. Long term numbers win it

Hampshire is probably the only other county that could pull off the nuke gabbing trick and if it manged it would be in a fairly strong position. That said the population imbalace would probably require it to use them against london in fairly short order. If it did that successfully its professional miltary forces would be in a position to hold off Surrey while neither Dorset, West sussex or Wiltshire have the numbers to pose much of a threat. Longer term tries to use the royal navy ships it has to blockade the north while a more ad hoc force locks up the Isle of Wight

Devon would be something of a wildcard. Not only does it not have to worry about outside threats too much (they've got the numbers to hold off Dorset and Somerset and the geography means they wouldn't have much to worry about from Cornwall). Their main significance is being home to Plymouth which gives them the royal navy submarines. Since being able to import stuff is pretty vital to the major players they have the ability to be highly disruptive. However they have a fairly limited number of torpedoes so would soon run out against anyone prepared to take losses running their blockade (London most likely candidate).

Positives:

*  Jules was cracking. Good to see the old man in top form again after his struggles earlier this season.

* I thought LCY looked very good when he came on. Yes he made a silly mistake late on but he hasn't played for a little bit, is still rusty, and was trying to hurry play along and force an equaliser. I'll forgive him that. Apart from that though, he was dynamic, had a decent passing range and most importantly offered the kind of surging runs from deep we don't really get with any other midfielder we have. Excited to see his progress.

* Souare had a pretty crap game offensively, but defensively I think he was much improved, which is heartening. He's very slowly learning the ropes, and hopefully next season he'll be ready to be serviceable.

* McArthur's still one of the best box to box midfielders in the league.",null,0,null,1429998461,null,0,false,0,cqolahd,null,t3_33ul5x,null,t1_cqolahd,null,t3_33ul5x,null,null,null,1432602173,null,5,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,5,null

In case you don't remember there was a world cup last summer. That delayed the transfer market from really kicking off until after it was finished. So Sanchez didn't make his mind up until pre-season had started. Remy didn't fail his medical until well into pre-season. By this time there weren't many alternatives left. The article says it was a choice between Eto'o and Balotelli. Eto'o didn't last until the end of January at Everton. So the choice was Balotelli or nobody. If we'd signed nobody, would you have been happy?. Its very easy to criticize with hindsight. So tell me, what alternative did you put forward at the time that would have done better this season?

I'm sure that at the end of season, there'll be a review and a lessons learnt. That should mean with repetition it gets better.

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"There are a lot of claims of action based on addressing the symptoms - rent controls, buy-to-let limits, etc. - I think we need to go deeper and try and find the root cause.

But before we even do that, we need to unwind some of the (arguably deliberately) counter-productive political initiatives of the past decade (or more).

1.  Remove all government subsidy of the (demand side of the) housing market.  E.g. no more ""help to buy"" or government (or even Bank of England) protection of mortgage assets.  Government money on the supply-side however could still potentially be useful.

2.  Drop the absurd notion of an ""affordable home"".  All homes should be affordable, in their own context, a 12-bed mansion in Surrey will be out-of-reach of someone on the minimum wage but it's still ""affordable"" based on the number of such properties and the numbers wanting them.  The current ""affordable home"" restrictions just adds red-tape and extra costs to new developments.

So what is the root cause of the housing crisis?  I think many of the popular cited demons are a red-herring, it doesn't really matter how many foreign absentee landlords there are, a house is not infinitely valuable; there is a market price.  This leads to two principal causes of the crisis, both related:

1.  Not enough viable property in the locations where they're needed.  It's all well and good politicians citing ""brown field development"" as the solution, but how many brown field sites are there within an hour of Central London?  Not many.  Also, ""you can get a 3-bed semi in Liverpool for £50,000"", is also unhelpful, for much the same reason.

2.  Not enough transactions.  This one is an ""elephant in the room"" (I hate that phrase, but can't think of a better way of stating it), the number of transactions per year is less-than-half what it was ten years ago.  This leads to two problems: 1) lack of efficiency in utilisation, e.g. it seems that half of the working population of Central London (~500,000 people) commutes in from an hour-or-more away, yet within one hour of Central London there are 2 to 3 million dwellings, what do they all do?; and 2) it allows the [market to be cornered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market), there are so few transactions that the market is disproportionately skewed by the aforementioned bogey men (absentee landlords); if the average house changed hands more frequently, this wouldn't be possible.

All-in-all this makes the housing market not-fit-for-purpose.  It's not only expensive, but also incredibly inefficient.  And it all needs to be unwound for anything to really work.  Fixing it will involve the obvious: building more houses; but it will also need to get people moving to make the market stable.

The radical approach would therefore be someway of forcing sales of properties that wouldn't otherwise be sold.  This is where my solution becomes more vague, but there are a couple of ways of doing it: some sort of ""right to buy"" on privately rented property; forfeiture of property that's badly maintained; or maybe even nationalising whole districts to redevelop with higher density.  But also we need wholesale infrastructure investment, in London, to broaden the areas that are feasibly commutable to Central London; but also the regions, to try and stop the whole UK economy being so London-centric.",null,0,null,1429999156,null,0,false,0,cqoln19,null,t3_33uq0s,null,t1_cqoln19,null,t3_33uq0s,null,null,null,1432602337,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

I find it unbelievable that FSG have somehow convinced themselves that the Red Sox used moneyball tactics to win 3 titles in the past 15 years. In 2013, which is generally considered to be the weakest of the 3 World Series teams, they had the fourth highest payroll in baseball. They have zero problem paying for proven talent when it comes to the Sox but apparently a huge problem doing it for Liverpool. Before you even start don't give me that FFP shite either, plenty of teams manage to succeed and comply with FFP. 

We wouldn't be starting from zero, we would need to hire a reputable and experienced director of football like nearly every other team in Europe, big or small, uses. Why FSG felt they were knowledgeable enough to reinvent the wheel here I'll never know. The point of all of this is that the choice should never have been down to Balotelli and Eto'o. Neither of them fit Liverpool's style and it's an abject failure from the committee if, as has been suggested, Rodgers was forced to choose between the two of them. 

And to your repetition point, that's laughable. The current top four are pulling further and further ahead of us every window because the transfer committee can't get it right. You only get so many bites at the apple before you're not even in contention for top players, and we're nearly there now. Blackburn, Leeds and West Ham used to be Premier League powerhouses, competing for European places every year. Know what happened to them? They pissed money up the wall on stupid, ineffective and bloated transfers and fell off the map. Cling to the moneyball shite if you want, it won't save us from falling further and further behind.

Are you sure you've looked at all the costs of this ? I researched it myself last year, and at that time I concluded its no cheaper than buying a place. It might be that costs have dropped since. Would be cool if they had.

last time I checked, you were looking at approx £5k for waste and water hookup minimum, not to mention electric hookup, internet hookup (if you can even get it to a new build you do yourself, or phoneline hookup), etc and the cost for a container (new ones are five figures plus, old ones arent in great condition) and the work to make it habitable worked out the same. The cost of land itself was also horrific (its easy to get some cheap in the middle of nowhere, but then that puts up the cost of getting waste/water/electric etc to you), anywhere near civilisation.

I looked into wooden homes where you can get them custom designed and the parts sent to you for assembly with instructions and so on - those ARE cheaper *if* you build the whole thing yourself or with some friends etc, but if you have to pay people to do it again the cost was the same as buying is with the major expense being the plot of land.",null,0,null,1429999949,null,0,1430000466,0,cqom1bv,null,t3_33uq0s,null,t1_cqom1bv,null,t1_cqokllx,null,null,null,1432602524,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The problem is the modern economy is almost entirely information based: technology, finance, media, etc.  There's no need to have access to land or raw materials as there was in previous agricultural and industrial ages.

In theory this would make it possible to live anywhere and work anywhere.  But there's still tremendous value in face-to-face collaboration, either within a team or with vendors-to-customers.  This means that there's a tremendous pull for people to be close to each other; but there is no-longer any counter-acting forces.

Megacities are inevitable.  If you're a company with an office in Central London, you'll be able to hire from a pool of 10 million people; if you live within reach of Central London you'll have dozens of potential employers.  If you're a company with an office in Exeter, you'll be able to hire from a pool of ~200,000; if you live within reach of Exeter there'll be one employer, and that's probably an outer-branch of a government department.

Rather than placing artificial limits on London, what we need is to encourage similar things to happen elsewhere.  Moving the financial world away would be incredibly difficult, but there's dozens of other niches that could be encouraged to grow elsewhere.  Maybe we even need to give UK cities their own tax-raising powers, or some other way of incentivising growth elsewhere.

I'd also keep rents down as much as I could by setting them based on council tax band, dependant on area and as a massive guess but something like a Band A house would be £300 pcm for studio, then £50 per  bedroom there after.

Living in a house price bubble sucks. Of course it sucks for owner occupiers - unless you want to trade down, the cost of moving house is prohibitive. First time buyers are priced out of the market, and those who do manage to buy run the risk of being bankrupted by the tiniest uptick in interest rates.

Why does anyone think that renters should be immune from this misery? London's rents are very expensive, but rental yields are very low. When we bought our house around 1995, typical rents on our street were around £1200/mo. Today they are around £1400/mo. So, while house prices have risen 180% in real terms, rents have actually *fallen*!

I don't think my street is unrepresentative. [Here's a graph from the ONS showing rent inflation from 2005-13 (best I could find).](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chart9_tcm77-315436.png) Over that period, rent inflation in England ranged from 5.2-11.0%, and averaged 8.4%. Over the same period, general inflation was over 30%! So rents fell substantially in real terms.

I agree that some reform to the rental market would be good, and Labour's suggestion doesn't sound terrible.

* Rent controls.  If coupled with the above, it makes the system a lot more predictable.

Speaking as a landlord who does *not* have any debt, such a new tax would be great for my business. The supply of rental properties would fall precipitously, so rents would go through the roof. At the same time, house prices would collapse, plunging millions of people into negative equity - market liquidity would disappear, so *demand* for rentals would skyrocket - pushing rents even higher.

Be careful what you wish for.

There's nothing that meets this description precisely.

However, if you operate a property business *(i.e. you let out a property for income)* you can treat mortgage or other loan interest in respect of that business as an expense of that business.  That is, you can claim the interest expense as a cost.

That's as close to a 'buy-to-let tax relief' as the bedroom tax is actually a tax.

The net effect, though, is that if you can stump up a deposit for a buy-to-let you gain a tax advantage

As an interesting side-note a lot of people don't appreciate that you **can't** claim any repayment element as an expense.  A lot of individuals don't declare their rental income, because their income doesn't exceed their total expense.

All his signings he made in the summer have done fuck all, says they perform well in training so I suppose that justifies the £25m for Lallana and £20m for Lovren.

Arguably it could be done along the following logical steps:    
a.  Property letting is a business only if it conforms to certain conditions.    
b.  A non-commercial letting activity does not qualify for the deduction of expenses in arriving at profit for tax.    
c.  100% of income could therefore potentially be liable to tax.

Another, possibly easier way of doing it would be to charge a higher rate of tax on letting income.  *(This could either apply across the board or just to property businesses with particular qualities.)*

And you make it sound like they're not spending any money with Liverpool. So go look into the finances of the club since they took over and then look at the new stand being built. As for FFP, they were investigated this year for it and passed, but they're obviously close enough to the limit that they were investigated. So wind your neck in. You're not spending your money on the team like they are. 

A new team would be starting from zero in that they don't know what players have been researched, what players Rodgers has probably requested, club policy on age profile, wage profile, what relationships have been built up with agents etc.  And not every team has a director of football. Most clubs in the UK don't. So again you're talking about something you know nothing about. 

And the top four are pulling away from us because they're doing better at transfers?. Would that include Man City who hasn't bought a player for the best 11 in like 3 years despite spending over 200m?. Like Man U who spent 60m on Di Maria so he can now start from the bench. Not to mind over 20m each on Rojo and Blind. Transfers are not a perfect science. Ferguson had some huge failures. So has Mourinho. Read the book from Paul Tompkins that researched all club transfers going back years and saw that at max only 50% are successful. And we're not in contention for top players because we'll only finish 5th in the richest league in the world, even though we're in Deloittes top 10 richest clubs?. Thats brilliant. But then to top it off Blackburn, Leeds and West Ham used to be PL powerhouses?. What planet are you on?. Blackburn were only a success for a very short period of time because they had a millionaire with way more money with sense. Leeds were successful because they spent crazy amounts with money they didn't have, and went bust as a result, and West Ham?. Are you drunk?

Anti-western sentiment in the Middle East bleeds into Islamic society overall, even in the west. There is no real, effective movement of liberal, progressive and enlightened Islam beyond a few individuals. Islam never went through an enlightenment in the same way the Christian West did. A whole host of historical and socio-political problems have led to Islam as a whole being in a dilapidated and deplorable state indeed.

But, again, we must not allow ourselves to get drawn into an ""us vs them"" mentality. Muslims and Islam are not the enemy. Extremism, savagery, homophobia, manic conservatism and other such things are the enemy, and they are found across the world in a variety of different guises. There are many good Muslims, Muslims who are moderate or liberal and who genuinely want to do good things and fight in a good way. Wahhabism is not the only type of Islam, nor is the maniacal Shi'ism of the IRI. I maintain that there is nothing inherent in Islam which makes it bad, evil or wrong; it is perfectly capable of integrating into a democratic, secular society as other religions do.

What must be done is to be highly critical of the problems in Islamic society, but not of Islam itself, or of Muslims as a whole. Specifically criticising Wahhabism and extremist Islam is what is needed, while actively praising and encouraging moderate and liberal elements in Muslim society. Treating Islam with understanding, respect and sympathy is a far better course of action than fear or suspicion. In this way, the discrimination and alienation perceived by many Muslims will lessen, social attitudes will be less hardened and we might perhaps see some kind of true Islamic enlightenment, to create a genuine, coherent alternative to the traditional or extremist schools of thought.

Hm. I think this is why our opinions differ because I like to judge players a bit differently, perhaps by more of how good they are at what they do rather than their skills and ability on the ball. Terry isn't as great on the ball as those players either but id put him above oscar and cesc. I always feel so comfortable on our left flank, he shuts it down like no one else and no one gets past him (except navas, but he was off form coming back from suspension for 1 or two games). 

I feel his contributions aren't as appreciated as other players because they aren't as attractive as someone like cesc or oscar. In those games where we sit back and absorb pressure, dave doesn't place a foot wrong. He's just so dominant at shutting down wingers that teams *rather attack the flank of arguably the best right back in the world* than dave's.

Neither of us do anything remotely business related though so I can't help with that. Both are good unis overall though, Lancaster tends to do slightly better in the UK rankings but Glasgow was much higher in the worldwide rankings and is Russell Group so neither will be looked down on. 

The cities themselves are very different but I'd be happy to be a student in either. Lancaster is a town more than a city and has a relatively massive student population so it definitely has a student town vibe. The uni campus is out of the city and all the uni accommodation is on campus too which makes it feel like a village populated entirely by students. The halls are split into colleges which have their own bars, social events, sports teams etc. so it always seems like the campus has a nice friendly feel. Someone else said that Lancaster feels cosy and that's definitely what I feel it's like. 

Glasgow is the complete opposite. It's a massive city and except in parts of the West End it's not really a studenty city. The campus is in the middle of the city rather than being separate on the outskirts, so there's none of the cosy, know everyone you pass vibe that Lancaster has. But the size of Glasgow is one of the best things. There's always something going on. There's art galleries and museums and music venues for any type of music you could want and comedy clubs and sports and political protests etc etc. You will always find something you're interested in. Glaswegians are the best people too, the slogan ""people make Glasgow"" is definitely true. Until I moved here I never realised that a city could have a sense of humour until I moved to Glasgow. I've lived here for 3 years now but I already feel like this is my city and I'd be happy to call myself Glaswegian (in contrast, I'm only just becoming okay with being called Scottish despite living here for 18 years!).

* Abolish restrictions on local authority borrowing against the value of council owned housing stock. This reform would give most London boroughs, whose current debt is lower than the value of their assets, a greater ability to support housing growth. 

* Give local authorities new powers to limit Right-to-Buy.

null,false,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,null,"Here's a poorly-written rehash and ramble of what I proposed a couple of weeks ago on a similar thread:

* Revise council tax bands to be more fitting for current property values - they were set for the first time in 1991, were outdated very shortly afterwards, and haven't been looked at since

* Mansion tax?  Good idea, but up the threshold slightly (£2.5-3m?) to avoid those who never had much money but watched the value of their property rise uncontrollably all by itself.  Take the proceeds and invest in social housing, or use it to give tax breaks to private developers and incentivise construction

* The price of new builds should be restricted to a certain proportion above what the house *actually* cost to build.  Fuck off with charging £500k just because of location, for something that was built for maybe half that

* Stop **all** government subsidies for end individuals.  No more Help To Buy, no more Right To Buy, or similar initiatives.  Why should someone receive a discount to take a council property out of circulation for themselves and thus reducing housing supply, while private tenants are being bent over?  Stop chucking petrol onto the flames

* A complete ban on BTL-specific mortgage and loan products.  Can't afford to buy a property to let out?  Tough.  It's absolutely appalling that we allow landlords to take on this extra debt in the first place, and have to charge tenants over the odds just to service it

* To elaborate on the above - introduce a ban on letting out a property which is subject to a mortgage

* A ban on mortgages for second homes, or any property that isn't your primary residence.  Again, can't afford it?  Tough.  ""Flipping"" would be allowed only once per tax year

* Rent controls.  Private rents should be capped or appropriately proportioned to the property's value and/or the *newly revised* council tax bands - no more £1700pcm for a one-bed crack den on a Hackney sink estate

* Residential properties cannot be owned by companies or trusts - named UK-based individuals only.  No more David Bloggs running his Leeds property empire from his Bond villain mansion on the Costa Del Crime, no more Vincent Chang from Singapore letting out half of Deptford.  “Proxy-ownership” (i.e. Xin Wang Chung pays a British person to manage the property on his behalf and get around the residency restrictions while funnelling the rent money out of the country) would also be illegal

I'll stop at that, because others in this thread have brought up other things you could add, including special tax on rents and tax on empty properties.  Miliband and Labour are definitely on to something, and so far Cameron and the Tories haven't come in with a rebuttal or ideas of their own.

House prices and private rents could very well win or lose a general election one day, given it's already a deadly serious crisis for this generation never mind the next.

Not sure where you got that one from? In Australia or other countries where they've been introduced then yes they're very damaging to the environment. But in the UK, where they are indigenous and form an important part of the food web they're certainly not. There might be cases where landowners/farmers want local population control - but in these cases hunting with hounds is not effective. Here's a study published in the journal nature that showed that the 1 year ban on fox hunting in 2001 due to foot and mouth had negligible impact on fox populations [source](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6902/full/419034a.html). They explicitly state ""Our results argue against suggestions that fox populations would increase markedly in the event of a permanent ban on hunting.""




The second issue is cruelty. I agree there appears to be something of a disconnect between the cruel way many farmed animals are treated and public outrage at blood sports. But the logical conclusion to that isn't to ignore all cruelty... Nor I think, does that disconnect suggest the ban could only have been a way of punishing the rich.



I think it's much easier for people to rally against the idea of cruelty in the name of sport. In fact in the UK, Badger-baiting and cockfighting have both been illegal in the UK since 1835 (when society was pretty cruel - we still had workhouses!) in recognition of their cruelty. Banning fox hunting and hare coursing was simply bringing some glaring omissions under legislation. I would probably suggest the reason that fox hunting had escaped legislation so long was actually because it played an important social role for lots of rural communities (and the rich!).



So far from a move to punish the rich, it was more like a removal of an exception they'd been granted for almost 2 centuries!

Torres started and Eto'o was bought literally the day before. Your timeline earlier doesn't make sense because Eto'o was already bought by the time Lukaku ""got his chances"" AND THEN decided to go on loan on deadline day. 

I find it funny how you take Mourinho's word for gospel when it supports you, but when I bring up direct quotes from him it's ""of course he's going to provide [that] explanation."" For someone so concerned that I'm ignoring aspects of the conversation you do a real good job of it yourself. 

Costa is a big part of it because if you trust Mourinho's word (which is unclear at this point because on one hand you do and on the other you don't) he has mentioned we were looking to bring in Costa a year before we did. Even still, we weren't going to ride with a strikeforce of Torres, Lukaku, and backup striker #3 whomever it may be going forward. Upgrading the striker position with a top player was always on the cards, that's where Costa comes in. 

Nobody's revising history, and your ""facts"" are debatable at best. I'll leave it at that. 

He didn't want to be 2nd or 3rd fiddle because it's not good for his development, and he didn't think he'd get a fair shake at playing striker at Chelsea. It's pretty obvious he thought things other than ability were going to decide who played so he went somewhere he knew he could play. I'm not saying he was wronged, he did what was best for himself in that moment.

Look back in history though as to when Liverpool have been most successful.. Shankly, Paisley, Dalglish. Were they big spenders?. No.. they were always behind ManU and others in both spending and wage levels. See the quotation about Shankly from his chief scout Geoff Twentyman on Wikipedia

&gt; Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman's brief was ""getting them young so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted"".

Players signed were often left in the reserves for a year before they were introduced into the team. And not all players that Shankly or Paisley wanted were signed, which is widely thought to be one of the main reasons Shankly left when he did. This being a transfer committee of sorts, the boot room discussions being one part, and the manager discussions with the board being the second. 

People seem to have a bee in their bonnet about this committee, but its almost certainly used by all other clubs as well in a fairly similar manner. See this article from Tore Kristian Karlsen as an example (translated from Norwegian)

Now he is 30 and still carries a solid larger wage than we would be jumping at if he didn't take a cut plus he would probably want to go someplace where he would be assured a starting slot, with Kane here it is unlikely that he would get that chance.

All that said, he has a nack of finding the back of the net, he is big and physical (albeit not pacey and not with a huge work rate), good in the air and can pass a bit.

I just think with it likely that we are trying to move 2 strikers who are 30+ during the summer it is very unlikely that we would make a move for another one from the exact same age bracket, especially when he would probably want to be in the mix for a starting slot and is a pure striker (you can't put him on a wing or at CAM).

null,false,notDvoiduRlooKin4,null,null,null,"lmao, keep talking shit dude. Balotelli wasn't brought in to play as a lone striker, and certainly not at the very top of our lineup. He clearly llikes to play a little deeper, with another striker in front that he can either play it off too, but more importantly that other striker creates space for him as well.

If he had someone decent to play up in front he would be playing a lot better and look a lot more comfortable, there are different types of strikers, and right now we are forcing him to play in a position where he isn't great. 

The other issue is with our squad in general, teams can easily double and triple mark balotelli (when sturridge is out) because there is literally nobody else that can actually strike the ball. We are back to where we were when we first signed Suarez - nobody else can shoot so they crowd the box and that player, and we just pass around the edges achieving nothing. I mean sure, Henderson and Coutinho have a few nice goals this season, but in general, neither them, nor Gerrard, Sterling, Ibe, Johnson or Can are even remotely threatening with the ball at their feet. 

We need to sign players that teams cannot afford to give any space to.

It's entirely possible he's carrying a knock. Imo since his return from injury he is slowing play down significantly going forward, and he isn't making the best choices in distribution either. There's a marked difference between the way he was triggering attacks last October vs now. It's like he's got a rusty hinge.

Martinez had also already played a Champions League qualifier for Porto on August 20th, and a Portuguese league match on August 15th. I'd really doubt Porto would have sold more than a week before that league game, and once he'd played the CL game he was of no use to us. 

And I'm presuming they did try to get a variety of other players once Remy was ruled out. Every club and agent knew they had money to spend and were on the look out for a striker. Its highly unlikely that they weren't offered a multitude of players, which for one reason or another was deemed unsuitable. As for the 10 (or more) contingencies, I don't think thats realistic. Top class strikers don't grow on trees. When they become available (which is rare) they're highly sought after, and the players involved have their choice of where they want to go. Even then there's no guarantee with them that they'd score anymore than Balotelli. How many goals has Falcao scored for instance?. Would he have been a stupid risk to take just like Balotelli?

Sturridge - injury prone. Should have signed a striker in January.

We should have had plan with targets clearly identified- what positions they would likely play, how they would fit into the side, are they likely available or not, what sort of money are we looking at, etc, etc.  The absolute most important thing we needed to do was sign a few players who, based on a bit of history, looked capable of scoring at least 10 goals a season.

What did we do instead?  Pined all our hopes on Alexis Sanchez and, beyond him, we had what certainly appeared to be no plan on how to replace the goals we lost.  Mario alone certainly wasn't going to do it, his best season in his entire career was 14 league goals and 7 of those were penalties and free kicks.

Frankly, our planning just completely sucked, I really don't see how you could see it any other way.  We ran around like kids in a candy store all summer, buying things we didn't really need.

Whether or not it's a deliberate handball is the matter at hand (pun intended) here. But Lamela is deliberately attacking a ball played to him by his own player, it wasn't smacked at him from close range. To me that intent makes it a deliberate handball.

I'd still love to see Pedro as a blue. He did so well in 2010 and is a consistent performer for Barca when Neymar is out of the picture. Which brings me to my main point, Neymar is more talented than Hazard, at least at this point and time. When Neymar was out on injury or fatigue, Pedro covered for him and filled big shoes. To think that Hazard will always be 100% fit for battle is a fairy tale. Having someone to compete/rotate with him can provide many advantages to the overall team's performance and endurance. Also, Schurrle was more neutral than attack-minded which likely prompted Mou to replace him.",null,0,null,1430022783,null,0,false,0,cqowsx6,null,t3_33vrf7,null,t1_cqowsx6,null,t1_cqow2f7,null,null,null,1432607679,null,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1,null
