The Greens and Alliance both take DUP votes in some places (I know it's weird but I've tallied ballots myself and there's a lot of ""DUP 1, Green 2"" ballots about, showing the overlap), and I know that both are aiming for more seats, and the smaller unionist parties have been getting stronger so the PUP might break through to the Assembly, and then PBP look set to win a seat (not from DUP, but still).

Can is supposedly a DM but hasn't looked suited. And I don't think a deep lying playmaker or whatever kovacic is (deep lying dribbler?) is a good idea either as they then need protection from the other midfielders.

On the other hand I would prefer a Lucas/Hamann type player to a Wanyama/Mascherano type. A player who reads the game defensively, cuts out attacks and distibutes the ball quickly and efficiently. Makes niggly fouls to stop counterattacks rather than big tackles that are red-card worthy if mistimed. My problem with the more aggresive DMs is that they're too cumbersome in possession (Wanyama wins tackles but then needs three touches to get in a position where he can make a decent pass) or too aggressive and chase the ball around the pitch.

Without Gerrard we're actually pretty mobile in central midfield now. We don't need a chaser, we need someone to stay deep and mop up behind our pressing, fill in spaces behind the fullbacks or between centrebacks, stop counterattacks and handle themselves against long balls.

Why would ANYONE want to fake that kind of life? It never ends unless you get better, get a job, or die.

You shut down thought. You no longer feel anything, because feeling is scary.

&gt; What will probably end up happening is these migrants will come to Britain, end up selling shitty little trinkets to tourists at Trafalgar Square and end up being a liability rather than a net-asset to the UK. The elite of Britain want tons of migrants because that gives them easy access to cheap labor and employees that they can easily abuse and overwork. 

Because this is the British way. British business is super short termist in nature. They see labour merely as an additional cost. The British idea is lets reduce labour costs! This will make our industries world class. Asians, Germans and such like invest in technology and training.

We can see this throughout history. In 1810 Chinese sailors were bought from China cus they cost 10% of a English sailor. 60 years ago the British textile industry imported tons of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani workers to suppress wage costs. This 100% worked which is why the UK has a world class textile industry and Leeds/Bradford are the richest places on earth /s

Today we are importing cheap migrant labour because British business still holds the idea that if we can lower wages we can increase profits. What they forget is workers are also consumers.

&gt;The elite of Britain want tons of migrants because that gives them easy access to cheap labor and employees that they can easily abuse and overwork. 

Yep it is GCSE economics. If we have close to 100% employment then wages have to go up to attract people from their previous jobs. As above employers want to pay as little as possible due to their short term nature. Back before the EU opened up we had this happen in the 1990s in certain trades. Truckers for instance there was a real shortage as you could only have British ones working for UK companies. So truck companies had to poach them from each other. Wages which you read about on trucking forums of about £50K a year (in the 90s) because of the acute shortage are not unheard of.

Then the EU opened up and a bloke from EE would do a trucking job for min wage.",null,0,null,1435489699,null,0,false,0,cslbkyg,null,t3_3bdvt7,null,t1_cslbkyg,null,t1_csl9vks,null,null,null,1437410807,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

I ran the four of them through a Squawka comparison matrix and I think people would be pleasantly surprised by what Asier might bring to the team as a ball-playing defensive midfielder.

* He had a pass completion of 91% last season for Madrid (Henderson 82%, Allen 88%, Milner 79%) - although it's common knowledge that you are allowed more time on the ball in La Liga.

* He made 42 interceptions (10 more than Henderson in second place on 32 and having played 2000 minutes less) 

* Henderson made the most blocks and clearances, but Illarramendi came second in both categories ahead of Milner and Allen.

* Illarramendi and Allen only picked up 3 yellow cards last season, Milner and Henderson both received 6 each. 

I'd like to try to give some idea of his work-rate and stamina, but they don't really make stats for that unless you want to trust FIFA 15 - which I don't. 

Something of note that impressed me is that he hasn't been injured **at all** since 2011. Whether that's something to do with playing less since joining Madrid in 2013 or the league being more of a technical than physical league, I'm not sure.

Exactly. Remembrance Sunday is for soberly reflecting on the horrors of war, and the noble sacrifice soldiers have made in laying down their lives to defend the country.

It's not a cost-free action, and its also not a rational priority. Where are the healthcare workers appreciation days? Firemen? Charity workers?

Equally, of course, you can end up winning many multiples of your original stake if the market moves in your favour.

We played our best football when the defence consisted of two definite central defenders (Sakho, Skrtel) a midfielder (Can) and two attack-minded wingbacks (at times included Marko, Hendo, Moreno). Which seems downright bizarre.

We need more protection, you're right. Milner should offer it, Clyne will be a positive if it happens, Moreno might settle down and improve, Lovren might grow into the team.

Just because I want to see Rodgers sacked, doesn't mean I'm a terrible fan. Moreover, me wanting to see him sacked doesn't mean I want us to have a shit season or lose matches, as the article seems to insinuate. Wanting Rodgers out in favor of a better alternative =/= Twitter posts and wishing we lose 7 matches in a row. If Rodgers turns it around, then more power to him. However, if he doesn't mature, become less stubborn, and start playing players in their natural position, then he needs to be let go, especially in favor of alternatives like Klopp, if they are available to us. 

Keep in mind, that prior to the last month of the season, I was firmly on fence about Rodgers, and perhaps wanted him to be given a year. However, when Klopp became available, and Rodgers flaws became increasingly clear, I think it was time for us as a club to trade up. If we had the chance to sign a player like Ivanovic and not play Johnson, you lot would have taken it. Why does an underperforming manager get an exponentially higher tolerance, especially considering he made mistakes and was stubborn throughout the season?

I think there is one mention in the latest terms but it is literally in the smallest print you have in that contract and not clear at all. I am not even sure it is the same terms that I actually checkboxed originally (more than 2 years ago which isn't accessible anymore). I took a same amount student loan in France and I had to have several contracts with multiple signature, face to face meetings and my parents as collateral etc. How can I tick a check-box on the internet and suddenly supposedly owe 30k£. That seems so incredibly shady to me but then again I am obviously very naive.

Isn't there some additional papers people should actually sign when they are effectively getting a loan? It just seems one small print in a dozen page contract spread over 3 different documents is largely unfair when it can actually cause you to owe dozens of time your original investment.

Additionally the bothering part of it is that if they were able to enforce margin requirements and my stop-losses I surely wouldn't have that loss. In their analysis they say they managed to close a huge part of everybody's trades at ""correct"" levels. Why weren't mine closed at those levels? It seems completely arbitrary. The sum they are saying I owe them would only mean 90% of my trades were closed at the worst possible time. 

I know this just sounds like a bunch of excuses. But I am just wondering the  document I originally read when I signed up would be considered as unfair terms or maybe borderline illegal. I did a lot of research and it seems like uncharted territory for brokers (I guess this never happened on this scale before).

**1500 meters**

Boys high school record (USA) = 3:38.26

Womens world record = 23.73

**High Jump**

Boys high school = 2.31 m

Women world record 2.09m

Etc, etc. 

You might wonder why I bothered even finding all these numbers? It's not some kinds of 'Oh look how much better we are' or anything. All the women I listed the numbers for are vastly more fit an capable than me, and they'd destroy me in any athletic event.

I'm just a bit sick of people pretending it's the patriarchy that is holding women back in sports when really it's just biology.

He's now in a position where he'll be reluctant to speak out about the situation as the media will have a field day and just twist it their way. Remember last time he tried to explain himself on with the Beeb he was pummelled.

Honestly I don't care about club finances to the point I'll get worked up about it, the figures are mind boggling with TV rights and foreign income. We're solvent, and that's what matters, Sterling should accept his hundred bags a week so we can all move on.

It's all about the club, and I'm not one to sit and watch supporters hound one of our better talents out of the club off the back of what they read on the back of a tabloid.

He's a better player than Ibe, and Ibe is good enough for the first team...So we can see what level of a player we have, Man City can apparently see too, why let such a talent go ?",null,0,null,1435495254,null,0,false,0,cslcty3,null,t3_3bb8zs,null,t1_cslcty3,null,t1_cskk24r,null,null,null,1437411769,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

YES!  I don't think that we should blame individual protestants for everything bad done by another church-member, but I think that American protestants really did have a moral responsibility to address racism - especially at the time of the KKK.  You don't?

&gt;Do Catholics have to take moral responsibility for the IRA bombing London?

YES!  I'm Irish and from a Catholic background.  I think Irish Catholics had a moral responsibility to address the murders committed by the IRA.  To take a stand.  You don't?

&gt;Do atheists have to take moral responsibility for Stalin's genocide?

To some extent, YES.  I think that atheists at the time, especially those committed to a worldwide atheist movement, probably had some responsibility to address Stalinism.  You don't?

&gt;Do Jews have to take moral responsibility for the killing of thousands of women and children in Gaza?

Here, I'm less certain.  To the extent that these actions are done in the name of Judaism, then yes, I think this is something that religious Jews should think about.  But, I don't think that secular Jews are really responsible in any way, unless they decide to identify as supporters of Israel.

&gt;When it comes to Islam though, everyone assumes we're all one big group of fanatics who want to destroy the West

Well, I don't think that and in case there's any confusion, let me spell this out for everyone - 

I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MOST MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS OR EVIL.

(Sorry, but I always get accused of believing the reverse.)


&gt;I do not take any moral responsibility, or feel guilty, for what a small bunch of fanatics do in the name of my religion. 

Well, I think you should at least give it some thought.  Right now Islam is causing untold problems, and you have *chosen* to align yourself with Islam.  To me that means you really do have a responsibility.

Sorry, but if I *chose* to join a group and then found out that 700 members of my group had run off to join a fascist insurgency, then I think I would have to ask myself some questions.  I don't think every member of the group should be blamed, but I think they do have a duty to at least consider whether the ideology espoused by the group is causing harm.

Edit:   This was a serious comment, and it was of course instadownvoted by bullies.  Because really - that's their only tactic.  They will simply try to shut people up who question their beliefs. They don't believe in debate - they think that they can just silence anyone who disagrees with them through downvoting, intimidation and name-calling.

Well, if Can *and* Lucas get suspended/injured we will have a problem. But honestly, in how many positions do we have *three* players who can do a *good* job? Allen can do a decent job at DM, at least if he's surrounded by runners like Milner and Henderson. It's not great, but it will work out.

It was heavily tilted towards Can's side of the field. Can even overlapped Markovic. Their roles weren't that much different to a regular RB-RM pair. If someone's role was similar to a fullback then it was Can's.

Britain did entertain some degree of negotiation but Britain was under no obligation *not* to take the islands back from force anyhow.

&gt; In fact, I think it's pretty obvious that Britain knew the attack was coming, after all there were threats made at the UN, there was the invasion of the South Sandwich Islands.

The government knew an Argentine attack was likely to a point after the South Sandwich invasion but they had limited time to produce a response. The actual invasion and occupation was rapid and in the long term unexpected (although they had warning signs hence why Carrington resigned), especially due to how difficult it was to communicate. However, the military action was ultimately forced on Britain by Argentine aggression; if Britain had not mobilised force and only negotiated it would have given the Junta time to consolidate irreversible defensive strength on the islands. There is a degree of naivety to the claims that we could've just negotiated out of the situation when in reality they didn't realise what deep shit they were in until the RN were very close to the islands as it was.

&gt; But as I keep saying, this is all besides the point. No military is there for the primary purpose to make people safer. I was unclear. There may very well be people who feel safer because of nuclear submarines and GR4s. It was said that people signed up to protect the British. And perhaps I was wrong to then infer that meant that OP thought the purpose of the Military was to protect British lives.

Fair enough, but your generalisation of the uses of the army was justifiably questionable re the Falkland Islands. This quote in particular;

&gt; I'm saying the motivation for launching a vast and hugely expensive military assault, leading do the death of over 2000 combatants, and the death of 3 civilians, that you think the British Army were trying to defend the freedoms of, had nothing to do with Freedom of said civilians.

Given that the regime which had occupied the Falklands was a notoriously brutal military dictatorship (one we sadly had previously been okay with), and that the islands population identified indisputably as British, I think you absolutely *could* make the argument that the conflict was fought at least partly for the freedoms of British citizens. Quite expensive it was but it achieved a result that negotiating alone would not have done. Furthermore waxing lyrical about how the British ruthlessly refused to negotiate completely misses the point of how Argentina attacked and staked the political survival of its regime on not budging on the islands.

Also the generalisation about reasonable freedom indexes and military spending seems pretty questionable but that's another debate.

&gt; I mean, I can't believe you're arguing this. The Falklands war was 100% a show of British might. 

This is a subjective claim of historical interpretation, not indisputable fact.

&gt; I mean, the British KNEW that the Argintinians were withdrawing after the invasion. And they moved to attack before the withdrawal took place.

Source? 

&gt; They did that because they knew there was literally no way a bankrupt Argintina could win. They were in a position of massive superiority. 

This is a poor assessment of the military situation. Argentina's military in 1982 was not one to be scoffed at, albeit weaker than Britain's of course, hence why the American's were very skeptical as to whether or not the British could actually liberate the islands. 

&gt; They attacked rapidly and violently to show that the British Armed Forces were still a world power, and that any tin pot shit hole should think twice. That is what is was for, and it really surprises me that anyone would argue otherwise.

And where are your sources on this being the only indisputable and overriding motivation? How can you argue this as indisputable when its basically a cynical argument made from hindsight that the British effectively pre-empted the conflict just to justify the military's existence? Its nonsense. 

&gt; And it probably didn't hurt that it distracted people while Thatcher was making large swathes of the country unemployed. After all, that is why the Argentinians did the invading in the first place.

It did solidify Thatcher's position very clearly (arguably won her the next election), but as a left winger myself one of the most frustrating arguments made about the Falklands by other left wingers often is a retrospective judgement that she must have only fought it for political capital - even though defeat was possible and would've ruined her and her government. 

&gt; But we're plainly not going to change each others minds. I think the notion that the military is there to ""protect the country"" and ""protect your freedoms"" is laughable. It's a completely modern invention. No one would have even suggested it 100 years ago. 

It isn't nothing but a modern invention at all, historical justifications for the role of the military ebb and flow and there have been many occasions previously when the defensive role of the military has been emphasized over the offensive, certainly before 100 years ago. The Napoleonic invasion scares are a good example of this. 

I don't necessarily disagree with your point about how this has been spun post Second World War but even then you're stretching to apply people's current justifications of the role of the military, and how the media portray it, to the entire post-war period and also ignoring that the military served a genuinely strategically invaluable role as an active deterrent during much of the Cold War.

First, the decision has got nothing to do with some sort of all or nothing policy in allowing political parties to participate. 

The OP already carefully explained to you that UKIP specifically were not welcome because their policies do not promote Gay Pride. 

That's because - this being 'Gay Pride' - the organisers discriminate against groups that promote the shaming of gay people, and in favour of groups that promote pride in being gay. 

If you disagree with this characterisation of UKIP, please feel free to explain to us all how their policies promote Gay Pride. Or, if you think that any organisation should allowed to participate in Gay Pride, no matter what their actual views of Gay people are, make that case.

* Sarah Silverman (Feminist)

* Richard Pryor ( Perhaps the greatest stand-up comic of all time.)

* Louis CK (Lot of anti-racist material.)

* Chris Rock (Another anti-racist)

* Lenny Bruce (Don't know much about him.  But a very famous stand-up.)

* Mel Brooks (Not familiar with his stand-up, but The Producers/Blazing Saddles were grossly offensive to some.  Anti-fascist.  Anti-racist.)

Why do we so desperately need a playmaker from the back when there are playmakers all over the pitch already? 

Look at Arsenal w/ Coquelin, once they introduced a player whose sole purpose was to just sit back, defend, win balls and simply distribute to playmakers, they looked so much more cohesive and balanced. And Coquelin isn't even that great of a player, he's solid but nothing special. Imagine they actually got a Matic like DM. 

Rodgers needs to let go of this idea of a technical DM, every other player on the pitch has that technical ability. Milner, Hendo, Firmino, Coutinho, Sturridge who could all be starting with a pure anchor man behind them, would be more than enough creativity. Get somebody in there who will do the dirty work and let the others gain even more freedom to venture forward. When Hendo plays with Can in the middle, you can see him not making those bursting runs into the box b/c he fears that the backline will be exposed, eliminate that. It'll have a knock on effect, it'll balance the team, it'll lessen pressures on creative players who should be further forward to track back constantly. 

Lucas does it for me, but his injuries are so damn frustrating. I know it's not going to happen but bringing in an established DM, a pure DM, would be great to see.

&gt; Was every Skyscraper, Cathedral, Road and bridge constructed as a result of architects and construction engineers doing Leisure and playing?

Ok, well, modern skyscrapers and bridges are underpinned by structural engineering - practical application of the physical sciences which involve no small amount of calculation and calculus. Cathedrals were built without so much know-how, but they took 50-100 years, not the 5 they'd take now. You think people should 'not be lazy' and build skyscrapers by hand?

.

&gt; Was every medial breakthrough a result of scientists and doctors dossing around in leisure?

The thing is, a scientist is basically someone who manages to get someone to pay them to research something. Most scientists aim for fields they are personally interested in. I imagine there are more people not doing science who would like to, then there are currently doing science who don't want to. Being an academic is a lot closer to living a life of leisure than someone working in a supermarket.

.

&gt; Did Cornelius Vanderbilt construct all the rail roads across America by just leisuring around?

Eh let's be lazy, and just read wikipedia!

&gt; The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.

&gt; Avery became a military engineer, rising to the rank of Captain by 1702, and **spent his free time performing experiments in mechanics**.

.

&gt; Did all the engineers and astronauts get satellites into orbit and put man on the moon by sitting on their backsides having fun and games?

Buuuut; 

&gt; 12-year-old **Wernher von Braun**, inspired by speed records established by Max Valier and Fritz von Opel in rocket-propelled cars, caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached a number of fireworks.

.


&gt; I rest my case.

People pursue their interests when they have the time and the opportunity. Once robotic workers overtake human workers for most routine work, huge amounts of people will be free to pursue their interests - who at the moment cannot. Most won't yield much. Some will. It will be a good thing.

.

Adam Smith says:

""A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground. More or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expence. In every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance. The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent.""

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Sorry to hear your father in law is unwell. Just a few ideas really;

&gt; It took the hospital 2 days for a doctor to see him once he was admitted to the ward

I hate to ask... but how do you know that? It's not uncommon for patients to not be seen by Doctors over the weekend if they are felt to be stable. To give you an idea, most hospitals will have about 1 doctor to 100 medical beds out of hours or over the weekend. Some will have even fewer. It's simply not practical for everyone to be seen out of monday to friday hours, so reviews tend to be kept for people that are unstable. 

&gt; He was dehydrated and no fluid charts were kept/no temperature charts.

Again I hate to question you, but how do you know? This is unlikely to be honest. It usually requires a doctor to sign off a patient from having observations. I wouldn't dwell on this stuff too much. Ultimately its down to the staff in the hospital to determine how and when they need to chart observations, and they'll be basing it on their own assessments. What you are interested in is seeing your father in law comfortable, and I'm not sure them monitoring his temperature really has any impact on that. You know he has an infection, so he has every reason to have a temperature, and beyond giving someone paracetamol there's relatively little else that can be done in a ward setting to control temperature... my point is leave that stuff to them, they will have their own systems and standards in place and the NHS standards on this stuff are pretty rigorous. 

In my experience the above concerns are very common, especially on elderly medical wards and tend to be born out of misunderstanding rather than negligent care. For example unwell elderly patients often open their bowels in bed (quite often as a side effect of antibiotics they are taking) and to be honest if they are doing it on the hour it can be difficult to keep them clean. I'm not saying its pleasant or ideal - but there are aspects of care which have to be realistic. It doesn't sound like they are doing a great job - but its hard to tell without having observed it ourselves. Rather than go in there firing from the hip about negligent care, I'd maybe try just asking them whats happening, and if you have specific questions/concerns like the ones above then just ask. Quite often there are actually reasonable explanations to these things... and if there aren't then that might be a point to consider raising them with PALS or the charge nurse. 

We can't really give you any specific advice because we don't know anything about the situation beyond what you've said... but as I said, I'd go in there and just ask. I don't think at this stage you really need to start shooting from the hip and firing off complaint letters to PALS.

I sympathize entirely that its hard to see a relative in hospital in distress. Generally the best approach to these situations is to find a nurse on the ward, ideally the nurse in charge of the shift, and just ask them whats happening and raise any specific concerns. NHS hospitals have pretty rigorous standards of nursing care and systems to ensure they are met. They are also inspected regularly by external agencies like the CQC. It's worth remembering that the nurses on that ward have a lot of experience in this sort of thing, and dealing with an elderly patient with an infection will be bread and butter stuff. Generally these things are the products of poor communication in a busy environment and misunderstanding rather than anything sinister.",null,0,null,1435499518,null,0,false,0,csle2o1,null,t3_3be58z,null,t1_csle2o1,null,t3_3be58z,null,null,null,1437412860,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

The NHS doesn't generally work like that. That's how complaints and legal situations arise... whereas when families are involved early on they tend to understand what is happening and it avoids complaints later on. 

I certainly wouldn't explore moving him to another hospital, it's unnecessary and dangerous.

* First talk to the sister in charge of the ward, they are the ones that run the show and are in charge of the care of a patient which appears to be your main concern. Also you have to be aware that hospitals are increasingly moving towards digital notes and so some of the things that you have mentioned may be recorded but you cannot see them. 

* Second try and talk to the junior doctor on the ward because they are often the ones that will organise the medical care for the patient for example what medications they require and how often their vitals are recorded.

* Third ask for a sit down meeting with the consultant as /u/chuckmorrissey has said.

* Finally if you are still not happy then contact PALS. You can ask anyone in the hospital how to do this, they are obliged to tell you.

My final note is: Please do not make a scene. It will not help anyone. It will only serve to make you more upset, and the staff resent you. Nothing will move forward.

&gt;More equal at that (PhD) level

I would go the opposite way and ask why the gap between Females and males that get accepted for PhD's is growing, as more Females get accepted over men (as a trend). 
This data is also interesting because more males apply for PhD positions, which suggest a bias in selecting woman.  This bias is also apparent in data which suggests that young women earn more then men, which would be the case if women get selected more in higher educated roles.

Less women are seen in higher placed rolls (Professors, CEO's, Upper management etc.) for two reasons.
The first is a generational reason. It would be a fact that when the leaders of today's businesses attended University, the percentage of women at University would have been extremely low. Then when you take out the women that don't use their degrees after uni, then take out women that studied a degree with no relevance to the career path, we see that it had to be a man to come out on top simply because there was not enough women. Now you can argue that less women was in education due to gender roles and you wouldn't be wrong. What is wrong however would be to blame males today (which we see) for what their forefathers done.

The second reason is gender. Nobody likes to admit that there is a difference between males and females. I like to believe that any individual human can do what every they want to do, what ever they enjoy doing and working where ever they want. The facts suggests that as a general trend women don't work as many hours as males do, usually for family reasons. So one reason why women aren't represented as much in higher levels of business is due to how the demographics work.",null,0,null,1435501061,null,0,false,0,cslelpa,null,t3_3bb6nm,null,t1_cslelpa,null,t1_csldn4p,null,null,null,1437413288,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt; women tend not to do maths or physics or engineering

That's the issue. Women aren't less capable than men, its the fact that popular culture has told them that [since they were in nappies](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/computerengineerbarbie.jpg?w=738).",null,0,null,1435501207,null,0,false,0,cslenmt,null,t3_3bb6nm,null,t1_cslenmt,null,t1_csldev9,null,null,null,1437413322,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null
null,false,rytlejon,lfc68,,null,"First of all: Markovic, Ibe and Can were not good enough to play in their ""natural"" position last year. When they did, they sucked. Markovic wasn't good when he played in a front three, Ibe wasn't good when he played in a front three, Can wasn't good in midfield. The wingbback solution won us a lot more games than the 4-3-3 ever did, and even more, it allowed three kids who weren't delivering in their natural positions to get some time on the pitch. If Rodgers did anything right last season, it was that formation. 

Then you describe Rodgers as stubborn. I don't think he is. If he were stubborn, he wouldn't have changed the team as much as he did last season. If anything, he doesn't seem stubborn enough. He played Sterling as a striker, out of his natural position, when our strikers didn't work out. Is that stubborn, or wrong? Obviously, he should have played our one true striker, Balotelli, the whole season?

Then you act like Klopp=Ivanovic and Rodgers=Johnson. That's an unfair comparison. Klopp took the 2nd richest team of the league and got them to 7th place (after being in the relegation zone). Rodgers took the 5th richest team in the league and got them to 6th place. Obviously under par - and we should be aiming higher than par - but those are the facts. How you can be so sure that Klopp would do better in Liverpool than Rodgers is beyond me.

&gt; Why does an underperforming manager get an exponentially higher tolerance, especially considering he made mistakes and was stubborn throughout the season?

Are you really wondering this? Because the answer seems obvious. Managers get higher tolerance because it isn't clear what is them and what is the players - did we score less goals because of Rodgers or because lack of strikers? And if lack of strikers, is that Rodgers fault or the transfer committees fault? They also get higher tolerance because switching managers changes more things than switching a right back. A new manager will need time to settle, might ""need"" some of his ""own"" players, might dislike some of the players that are already in the squad. I suppose you already know these things though.

 &gt;especially considering he made mistakes and was stubborn throughout the season?

Well, made mistakes - everyone does those, and that's fine. Each and everyone of our players have made mistakes over the season. Stubborn - I still don't see what you mean here. What I think you mean is that he didn't do the things you wanted him to do. But the word seems out of place because it seems like you think he didn't do enough changes.

OK, first of all, this isn't about people being excluded. As has already been explained to you in this thread just a short time ago, UKIP is being excluded. UKIP is an organisation, not a person. UKIP members are free to join in, they just aren't allowed to promote UKIP while they are there. 

Secondly, and this has been asked of you multiple times, where is it written that Gay Pride is this one special event in the universe that has a moral obligation to accept any organisation no matter what it's beliefs and attitudes are? Gay Pride makes no claims to be universally inclusive in this way, there is nothing in its name to suggest that this would be the case, nothing in its mandate and nothing in the ideas that it is promoting. It's agenda is Gay Pride, if your organisation is not down with Gay Pride, then it is not welcome. How hard is this to understand?

I think a lot of the current issue with professorships,  etc., is due  to a historical lack of women and the other pressures that they face in comparison to men (eg. Having children would  hugely interfere with my career simply due to the time off if nothing else, but not my partner's). But that doesn't mean we can become complacent about it. 


There is still some bias against women seen at the PI and tenure track level. You only have to look at the recent fellowship kerfuffle at the Royal Society to see that there is still bias seen against women. CVs with female names tend to get rejected more often than male, and women tend to have less on their CV at the same age (partly due to the previous clause and partly due to the type of issues you mentioned, eg. family pressures).

What I would like to see is a trend towards a more equal distribution of family and care -based responsibilities between the genders. I belive that would remedy most of the inequality in numbers still seen. As a woman of childbearing age,  I am a less desirable worker than a man as am likely to leave to have children at some point in the not too distant future. Whether I want children or not doesn't factor into employment decisions since A. They can't ask, and B. Accidents can happen. From an employers perspective, it makes sense not to employ me, but from my perspective it is unfair.

Unless there's an injury crisis, I doubt anyone else will get much of a look in as they're not really anything special at this stage. Hesketh is talented, but way behind where he needs to be, physically. Seager could use a loan to see if he can bridge the gap from U21s to senior football.

McQueen is a winger with no pace and prone to injuries. Can't see him making the grade, I'm afraid.

Turnbull is nowhere near being ready for first team football. He might get a gig on loan back in League One. His partner in crime at Swindon, Jack Stephens, is further along in his development and *might* get himself into the squad (like McCarthy was last season) as a regular substitute if he impresses in pre-season, as he can fill a couple of roles (CB, RB, DMC), albeit not amazingly well. He's Callum Chambers-y. 

Will it be Ward-Prowse's ""big season""? I'm not convinced he's anywhere near as good as the hype surrounding him. If Saints had shelled out £20m for a feeble, slow, creative midfielder who doesn't score and is mostly anonymous game after game, I suspect fans would be a little underwhelmed. 

I'd love him to prove me wrong, though. 

I honestly think Reed is a better all-round midfielder. He's neat enough in possession but has the edge on Ward-Prowse in his tackling, work-rate and competitiveness. From the U21 games I've seen, he's a better passer than he's shown so far in the first team, where he's mainly had a defensive, play-it-simple brief.

Yes, you are looking for a prepaid plan -- I've used T-mobile in the past. Quite expensive, but includes everything you need. One thing to note is that they do not seem to sell these plans in the shops like they do here, you need to order ahead of time. This was my experience a year ago, even going into a T-mobile shop I wasn't able to walk out with a SIM, had to have it posted to my parents (who have a U.S. address).

&gt;  I'm going to mostly be staying in Air b'n'b places - is is true that Americans don't have kettles? How the hell do I get a brew in the morning?

Pretty much yeah, might have a kettle that goes on the hob. You'll find a way.

I don't know much about Denver or Chicago, but in San Fransisco and Seattle you will have a wonderful time. As an aside, since you are going that way anyway, I much prefer Portland as a place to visit over Seattle. Great food, great beer, great coffee, and much more of the walkability you'll be used to (although Seattle is pretty damned good for walkability vs. most U.S. cities already).

I live on a peninsular called the Gower, just south of Swansea City.  We've got a bunch of villages of various sizes, beaches on all sides, and a tourist industry big enough to be established without being oppressive.

If you're interested in heritage,  we have a small museum/park type thing called the heritage centre.  Local food and drink, an old working water mill, it's a nice place to just wander around and soak in.

The Gower was the first place in Wales to be dubbed a place of Outstanding Natural Beauty - there are some fantastic walks and we have some gorgeous scenery.

A lot of places are quite expensive here, but we have two Youth Hostels which are really nice, and good if you're on a budget, and they're both right on a beach.

Beginning of August there's a massive agricultural show here. As well as all the animals, there's a funfair, local food, just a lot of culture.

A story that's not only being followed by the swedish people, but also by the big clubs of Europe. Ludwig Augustinsson's agent today confirmed that the leftback is being chased by several clubs, among them english Liverpool.

'Several clubs have declared their interest, both before and during the Euros. Many says that they are very interested', agent Per Jonsson tells SportExpressen.

'Liverpool are monitoring him and like him. No negotiations has been started. Whether or not they will in the future, I don't know. But I can't say they won't. They do like him.'

&gt; There is still some bias against women seen at the PI and tenure track level.

If you have any sources about that I would love to read it.

&gt;What I would like to see is a trend towards a more equal distribution of family and care -based responsibilities between the genders

I think this bit is the most interesting talking point. I think we need to take a step back and look at the large picture. Now obviously the care of the child has to be shared between the males and females have they have equal responsibility for their progeny. So in this I would include housework (especially just after birth), the school run, extra-curricular activities etc. We should recognise however that men and women are different and it is these differences that can be used to help nurture a child throughout its young life.

&gt;I am a less desirable worker than a man as am likely to leave to have children at some point in the not too distant future.

Here is the crux of the problem, birth. I will say it is not fair that somebody may not be employed because at may some point in the next 15 years you may want a child. A point (not one you mentioned specifically) which I see as dishonest is if you were to say for example a woman didn't get promoted simply because she had a child. I have a problem with this point because it suggests that the person who did get hired (regardless of gender) isn't qualified, when the reality may well be that this person has an extra year of experience because they haven't had children.",null,0,null,1435503951,null,0,false,0,cslfrny,null,t3_3bb6nm,null,t1_cslfrny,null,t1_cslf2ao,null,null,null,1437414131,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;Tolerance is NOT making a joke at the expense of of a minority, not a free pass to having no-one challenge them (particularly if they something offensive).

I don't mind criticism.  But when people decide to act as the moral police and join in with mob outrage then I have a problem.  As far as I'm concerned, it is fundamentally intolerant to try to bully or shame those you disagree with into silence.  Doesn't matter if you think you're right, or that you're 'calling out' bad ideas.  

As far as I'm concerned, part of tolerance is allowing people you disagree with to have a say without trying to intimidate them into shutting up.

&gt;People used their free speech to criticise them.

Not sure who you're referring to here.  I don't know who 'them' is.  But, again - there's a difference between criticism and hounding people because you don't like one of their jokes.

Selly Oak is awful, and I can't imagine having to raise kids there. On the other hand, I imagine it's hard to be priced out of a neighbourhood that you've lived in for years. Buy-to-let landlords can cheaply convert a 3-bed house to a 4-bed house, and then let it out for more than £1200 a calendar month. Most long-term residents of the area are going to be unable to afford that, especially as in other neighbourhoods nearby you can rent a 3-bed house for half that.

I should say that I understand why students live in Selly Oak, I did too as an undergraduate, and I completely get wanting to live near your mates, the pub, and uni. I don't think the 18-year-olds that move in are really culpable, but that doesn't make it any less of a problem.

It's terrible too, because the current situation is bad both for locals and students. It's bad for the locals because; aside from being priced out of their neighbourhood, the money students spend isn't getting evenly distributed into the local economy. It's all going to a select few businesses on the Bristol Road, and most of those are big chains anyway. It's bad for the students because; aside from having to pay artificially inflated rent, they're getting a really cloistered university experience. University should be a learning experience where you meet all sorts of different people and get to interact with somewhere new, but with Selly Oak being how it is, lots of students end up only talking to other students. A lot of the people I went to uni with openly expressed contempt for locals.

Like I said, I don't think that the students are culpable for this problem per se. They are culpable for being awful neighbours, but to a certain extent that's what you expect when you densely populate an area full of houses of kids living alone for the first time. 

I think other people are culpable though. Mostly planning officials who let this totally predictable problem happen by constantly approving cheap conversions of the terraced houses into 4 or 5 bed monstrosities. These houses end up being places that only students would want to move into. Families aren't going to want to move into houses that have a bedroom instead of a living room, a tiny kitchen and no natural light. Most of these planning applications should've been rejected for the houses just not being fit to live in in the first place.

Estate agents and property entrepreneurs are also responsible for luring in naive buy-to-let landlords with the promise of raking in tonnes of money. Of course demand in Selly Oak is totally artificial, there are more bedrooms than students. The estate agents neglect to mention that this means that unlike in a normal lettings market, if you fail to let your property in the narrow November-January lettings period, you'll end up paying the mortgage on an empty house for a whole year, so it's not even a particularly good investment.

I've read that prior to the 1990s or so, students were more evenly dispersed around South Birmingham. I think that a situation like that would be better for everyone, but I don't think we have any way of getting back there. Even if the students suddenly disappeared, it's not like people would want to move into strangely converted houses in Selly Oak.

null,false,NeoNerd,null,null,null,"Huh, seems we have similar holiday plans. I'm off to the US in a week, will be traveling by train (mostly) and also spending time in California and the Pacific Northwest. Also staying in AirBnB, and will be by myself for part of it.

&gt; I'm planning on getting a large smartphone to take, I need to be able to make / take calls within the USA (would only be shortish calls), and use SMS / Facebook / Skype / etc to stay in touch with folks back here. Should I get a PAYG sim when I get there? Would this include data?

I'll be using a 3 PAYG SIM from the UK. Their 'Feel at Home' program lets you use your phone abroad in a number of countries at no extra cost. This includes the US. The only thing to be aware of is that for PAYG customers, you need to convert your top-up into an add-on to get the benefit. I converted a £15 top-up into an All-in-One-15 pack, which gets me 3000 texts, 300 minutes and 25GB data over the next 30 days. 

Using a 3 SIM is good for phoning or texting home, as these all come out of your allowance. It's less good for calling or texting US numbers - these will cost extra. The reverse is obviously true of a US prepaid SIM.

&gt; I'm genuinely concerned about getting my tea fix while I'm there, I can't drink much coffee because of IBS, but I need caffeine in the morning to get me going. I'm going to mostly be staying in Air b'n'b places - is is true that Americans don't have kettles? How the hell do I get a brew in the morning?

Electric kettles are pretty uncommon - the American electrical system means that they take much longer to boil water than ours do. But most places I've been have a kettle you put on the hob. Worst case scenario, you could always boil water in a pan. Or even in a microwave. \*shudders*

&gt; I'm 40, female, and I want to be able to go for a drink in the evening, and hopefully chat to people. How easy is this going to be? Are all the bars full of 20-somethings? Am I going to be able to find friendly places where I won't get hassle for being a female and on my own?

My experience might not be too helpful here (as a male 20-something) but there's just as wide a variety of bars in US cities as in the UK. So there's going to be some places that suit you, and some you'd probably not enjoy. 

The other general advice I have would be - relax and don't worry about things. I was more than a bit scared when I first went to the US by myself too. But Americans are, in general, so friendly that it's really not hard to meet and speak to people. People loved my accent, too.

 * The actions of terrorist organisation The National Liberation Front of Tripura who use their religion to justify violent attacks, forced conversions, rapes and massacres. 
 * The genocide perpetrated by Christian militias against Palestinian refugees during the 1975-1990 Lebanese civil war.
 * The decades of Christian sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, which also lead to several terrorist attacks on the British mainland. 
 * The massacre committed by Anders Breivik who murdered 77 people (mostly children) who intended to attend a church in Frogner for a ""martyr's mass"" and considers himself a ""modern-day crusader"".

There is no bar on bringing over tea bags yourself - keep them sealed for the flight over.  You might also like 1% milk if you don't drink black tea, which is the equivalent to semi-skimmed over here in the UK.

Many North American kitchens don't have kettles - it's a cultural thing.  Also, houses and apartments in the States have a lower voltage on their ring mains than we do over here, so kettles take a lot longer to boil than ours.  You might be better off heating water on the stove, or using a microwave.  Alternatively, you can use the coffee maker to heat water.  Fill the reservoir, keeping the filter area clear, and the heated water should drop in to the Pyrex jug.  It may still taste of coffee, though :(

If you go to a restaurant, it is expected that you tip 15-20% of the bill.  This is for the wait staff, who typically do not have a liveable minimum wage.  If you go to a bar for a beer, giving the barman $1-2 per beer is typical.

Yes - with the exception of Fridays - you will *almost certainly* be standing from WOK to WAT any time after 6:30am through to 8:30am.

The good news is that you can get a seat on a return journey by getting on a train that leaves after the next one to WOK.

&gt; Would it be worth paying the extra for a first class season ticket?

I tried this. Generally the answer is no. If the train is crowded (and it is always crowded) then there is a good chance (better than 50%) that it will be standing-room only in First Class also.

Plus you have all sorts of anti-social BS going on in First Class. Men will sit in the aisle seat and only begrudgingly move to let you sit near the window. People who clearly have no right to be in First Class will sit there. Often in very crowded situations you'll have economy class passengers in the First Class section.

null,false,pazuzuX,null,null,null,"id advise most people to pick college; you get a new start, meet new friends, plus you're treated more like an adult, which is a great preparation for uni, and life in general. its a challenge, but in a good way. school is the safe option.
if you don't hand homework in, they don't hassle you as much as they tend to in school 6th forms (so i heard from friends who stayed on); so you have to grow up pretty fast, but in a good way. same with skiving off classes. school is soaked with the scent of sweaty trainers and boiled school dinners and despair. college smells of freedom and the potential for sex :P
the only downside might be travelling time, if its further off? but you can use it to read books, do homework, and listen to music/podcasts.
the best bit is the freedom; no uniform, but even if your school 6th form is nonuniform, you'd still be around all the kids below you who are. the teachers are *tutors*; and none of them have known you since you were 11, so you get a new start with them which can be liberating.
the atmosphere at college was just so much better, for me.
plus, rather than having 100, 200 people in the 6th form at school, college will have a thousand or whatever; chance to find friends who are into the same obscure obsessions as you : )

with regard to your choices; can i stick my oar in?? 
media studies is regarded as a soft option to the point that many top uni's don't even accept it. you will be able to change your choices both at school and college now or at the start of term, but i do recommend you do so. russell group uni's don't like media studies~ http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100074686/its-official-if-you-do-a-levels-in-media-studies-or-law-you-wont-get-into-a-top-university/
http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/feb/04/university-places-traditional-subjects-a-levels
instead, do philosophy, a language (inc latin), classics, psychology; something challenging and interesting like that. i did philosophy a level; its very hard, but the best thing I've done in my entire life. it is VERY well regarded; it will teach you incredible critical thinking skills; ideal for journalism. its like brain yoga.

if you want to be a journalist, you'd be better off doing a degree IN whatever field you want to cover, or something which encourages/covers critical thinking; literature, politics, philosophy, history. from oxford uni's website: ""Oxford University does not offer an undergraduate degree in this subject. However, many degree courses at Oxford could be an excellent preparation for a career in journalism. For more information about careers, see www.careers.ox.ac.uk.
There are also extensive opportunities for extra-curricular work in this area: see Living in Oxford.
Students interested in Journalism might also like to consider English Language and Literature. The Faculty website gives further information on the structure of the course.""
any journalist I've ever met or heard discuss their background has done a traditional degree like that. a journalism degree is NOT a good route into the industry, which is already fiercely competitive. give your self a better chance with a better choice.
i knew a guy who was a classical music journalist; he did music (theory) and law, as he said a lot of classical music was tied up in rights, so that gave him an edge.
look into the backgrounds of journos/writers/presenters you like; lots of politics, PPE, philosophy, english lit, and history, even sciences. NO media studies.
the other side of colleges is the greater scope for clubs; my school had a decent selection, but they were upper and lower school, so id still have been mixing with spotty, wobbly voiced 14 year olds; bit annoying when you're 18. 6th form college will just be 16 year olds upwards, and will probably have a greater range of activities too.
best of all; you never have to say 'yes sir/miss' ever again!

In saying that, people who are downvoting your message are just going on the gist.

If the point of his comments is to disassociate the majority of Muslims from extremism, and keep them from drawing lines in the sand, then you're right - the right way to do this is have voices from within, relevant voices, saying what he's saying.

null,false,Jameslepable,cnty-uk,Liverpool,null,"This isn't a segregationist argument what so ever. My argument is based on statistics (actual evidence). What I can gather from what you have written is you believe that women don't have an equal opportunity (I chose that word carefully) compared to men. The facts say that is nonsense. A metric to determine how ""equal"" men and women are is salary. The salary of the previous generations favour men for a variety of reasons from the amount of work men do to the type of work that men do. The salary of the current generation (21-29) shows that women get paid more than men. The reason for this is that more women go to university, more women graduate and more women get graduate jobs.

Quotas serve nothing other than to divide the workforce. They breed a culture of ticking boxes, not hiring the best possible person and breeds resentment amongst the workforce because if a woman does get promoted then someone will say ""It's because she's a woman"". I cannot see how women aren't offended by quotas as it suggests that they cannot get there on their own, it takes away from an individuals accomplishments because their position now becomes a gender issue and not a performance or intelligence or experience issue.

Edit: I forgot
&gt;the woman clearly worked harder for it

Am sorry but no. Having recently finished university (but didn't study CS) and having both male and female friends that took CS that is BS. Every student that got a good mark worked extremely hard, and to say a woman worked harder because of ""lack of support"" (what a vague term) again doesn't give credit to the individual it gives credit to their gender. The irony being of course was the two women on the CS course used their degrees to study law and accountancy because they didn't enjoy the subject.

There may be online mobs, but they have done nothing to Katie Hopkins, Jim Davidson, Frankie Boyle, and even in purely online terms, someone like Alex Day. But who has been hounded off? The women who dared to campaign for Jane Austin to be on the ten pound note, (the problematic but hardly evil) Anita Sarkeesian? 

I can only respond in terms of my own behaviour, usually on reddit, where i have found individuals with a lot of upvotes who are saying things which are offensive. I honestly don't see the problem of talking to someone when they have chosen to air their views. They don't have to respond to me, they can put me on their ignore list like you have with me, and I have done with others. I have an equal right to challenge those views, as people have to air them. Airing one's views is fine, but it is still an action. They don't *have* to air those views, particularly on more 'public' subreddits like /r/pics . 

You can fight irrationality with irrationality, but I'd hardly say I have been anything but cold and logical in most of the debates I've had. Someone accused me of being a social justice warrior for pointing out that Italy has to guarantee freedom of religion as part of its EU membership. I don't agree that this is intimidation against an 'opinion'. I think this is logic against prejudice that someone has actively chosen to type out. 

People use their free speech to criticise people who make offensive jokes. One does not supersede the other.

Then there were the technical difficulties. They caused those pauses in between songs that were just long enough to kill any forward momentum. then Kanye would have to build it up again. And I'm guessing his ear piece wasn't playing the backing track properly because he stopped mid sentence in a few songs. And not to let the crowd sing, just flat out stopped. I like the songs from Cruel Summer, but I would have fucking loved it if he did from earlier stuff like Through the Wire and Heard Em Say.

The reports seem to be coming from outside the UK and from sources that don't normally report on Spurs.

Stobart and Collomosse, who are two of the most accurate writers when it comes to Spurs, haven't said anything about there even being a discussion about Kono. 

Matt Law who frequently covers Spurs, and has a tendency to carry stories much quicker than most of the other writers (he seemingly has willing to sacrifice accuracy for speed numerous times in the past), has said nothing about Kono.

Jason Burt, who has slowed on his coverage of Spurs but has been all over the Paulinho move has said nothing about Kono.

Lyall Thomas, who has been very accurate for the past year when it comes to Spurs flat out said it wasn't happening as far as he knew.

So we have no reports from the UK of it being an actual transfer target despite it being Sunday when all the papers and services run numerous stories to fill up space.

On top of that, the agent who seems to be at the centre of all of this works for a firm that represents, in one fashion or another, Alderweireld, Imbula, Thauvin, Martial, Llorrente, Cabaye, Salvio, Moses, Feghouli, Konoplyanka and Leandro ""fucking"" Damiao.  All of whom we have been linked with at some point.  So an agency that has been willing to use us as a leverage point in past situations is one of the driving pieces of evidence.

it depends on the individual, really; both can be really strong. if you moved from london to the highlands when you were 14, you might remain culturally a londoner for the rest of your life, even if you stayed in the highlands for ever. the influences you have at a young age influence you for life, whether its direct experience or through a relative. like i know born and bred londoners who identify as bangladeshi etc despite never having been there, and being mixed bangladesh and pakistani or indian; cos that was their dominant cultural influence growing up.

The drop in unemployment, just like the rise in unemployment, was due to global economic issues, an issue the UK government could do very little about after they focused correctly on developing international banking in this country, very successfully I might say.

It's a myth that, if it persists, risks our future.

The DUP and Sinn Fein need each other.  To move forward, we need to establish a proper opposition and relegate them both to the fringes where they belong.  Hopefully in the long run we'd see their influence purged completely.

Everyone has the right to their opinion. Everbody has the right to encourage other people to take action so long as that action is within the law, such as complaining to an employer about what their representatives have said. 

Freedom of speech offers a voice, nothing more, it doesn't promise any ears, it doesn't mean an opinion should be respected. People can tell other people to shut up, they just can't physically make somebody do so, the law protects them from that.

The way zhr contracts I've seen work is that the agency sends a text out to a list of people, and whoever responds first gets the shift. If someone doesn't reply, or if they reply to say they aren't available, someone else gets the shift instead. It's no skin off the agency's nose. The bigger the pool of employees, the better for the agency, so they aren't going to punish people for not accepting shifts by dropping them from lists. 

In other shift recruitment situations, it's usually much more efficient to offer shifts than schedule people for them, and wait for a round of people saying they can't make particular days, or whatever else. The only real situation where punitive action against employees makes sense is where staffing is extremely short, where you might need to be extra persuasive in getting staff in.

I used to suffer from it, and it really is the pits. What helped me really looking at my routine and cutting out things that didn't help and boosting things that did. Most of it was trial and error, can't say they'll work for you, but maybe it'll give you ideas!

So! First of all, I used to get NASTY pimples around my mouth, especially around period time. I experimented with not using an SLS toothpaste, and now that's eliminated. I found that while SLS (sodium laureth sulphate) never used to be an issue before, but for whatever reason it started to make any pimples around my mouth worse during my period. I cut out all SLS products in my skincare routine. My skin overall has been doing better.

Through trial and error, I found that propolis and honey were really good for any skincare issues I was having, so I started to look for products that had these as the star ingredients. It was at this point that I started trying focus on boosting my overall skincare health, than trying to tackle *just* the pimples. If I could fight them before they happened, then maybe I wouldn't need to be constantly putting out fires. So, I started looking at my moisture barrier and searching out for products with [ceramides](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ceramides) in them which are fantastic for maintaing healthy skin.

Diet is really important. We have to make sure things are working well in the inside so they can be reflected on the outside too. I make sure to try and drink enough water to ensure I'm hydrated. I know it's kind of gross, but I use the [urine hydration](http://www.patientsafetyfirst.nhs.uk/ashx/Asset.ashx?path=/NHW2013/Bedford%20Hospitals%20hydration%20safety%20resources.pdf) chart to keep track of it, the doors in the loos at work all have them stuck on the back. 

I try not to eat out, and try to eat light for lunch. I tend to just eat leftovers from dinner. I've identified dairy as a big trigger for me. I'm lactose intolerant, and my skin really isn't on board with large quantities of lactose even when I take the pills for to help me digest it. Poor sleep and stress also add to my poor skin, so looking at your schedule is also something you could do.

&gt;The issue of people working on zero-hours contracts is a tricky one. The ONS has published figures suggesting that 2 per cent of people in employment are on a zero-hours contract – or about 622,000 people. But we don’t know whether that is more or less than in 2010.
Last year the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Andrew Dilnot, gave Labour a slap on the wrist over a dodgy press release that claimed there had been a “huge increase” in zero hours contracts under David Cameron, when there was no evidence of a rise.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25098984

&gt;UK workers on zero-hours contracts are more likely to be happy with their work-life balance than other staff, a survey suggests.

&gt;The survey found four out of five respondents on zero-hours contracts said they were never penalised if they were unavailable for work.

And According to ""Analysis of Employee Contracts that do
not Guarantee a Minimum Number of Hours"" by ONS page  18

&gt;Around 14% of people on “zero-hours contracts” are looking for another job, more than for people

null,false,Shaper_pmp,null,null,null,"&gt; How is it in any way toxic to show some slight appreciation to people that work incredible hard serving our country? 

Because it's not *just* about appreciating the people who serve in the armed forces.

It's also inherently and unavoidably about glorifying the whole *idea* of the armed forces, and presenting their existence (and hence implicitly *also their purpose*) as something exciting and socially-lauded that we're happy exists, rather than the regrettable (but respect-worthy) aspect of society it actually is.

A day where we remember the sacrifice of armed servicemen reminds us to value the ones we still have, but also keeps front and centre in people's minds the fact that we're valuing these people *because they're doing a tragic and dangerous job* that we'd really rather as a society wasn't necessary.  They're doing it so you don't have to, but ideally nobody would have to do it at all, and employing them to exercise their function carries tragic and unavoidable costs.

A day where we *celebrate* people who serve in the armed forces is also a day where we celebrate the *existence* of the armed forces, and you can't do *that* without also glorifying and celebrating the fact of war and violence.

Why are we celebrating them, after all?  Because they kill people in other countries and die themselves to protect us.  Doesn't that mean it's *inherently desirable* that they kill others and die themselves?  Well of course, or else we wouldn't celebrate their role or purpose or actions, but rather we'd soberly remember and give thanks to those who'd died and respect those still in service... only *that's Remembrance Sunday*, not happy-celebrate-exciting Armed Services Appreciation day.

Nobody wants to admit that they're glorifying the act of war or the acts of killing or dying for your country, but that's the message it sends when the whole of society celebrates the people and the entire purpose of their jobs.

Just look at the US, where the whole ""support our troops"" rhetoric has been corrupted into a mandatory fetishisation of the military and military conflict, and anyone who suggests they *really* support the troops (eg, by allowing them to come home, see their families and not get killed thanks to politicians' foreign adventurism) is painted as a traitor or someone who hates soldiers.

That idea, that ""supporting"" soldiers constitutes sending them off to die and advocating they come home and live is ""betraying"" them only exists because of a fetishisation of violent conflict and the military itself, and that starts with the process of glorifying and lauding soldiers themselves as something people should aspire to, rather than people who do a regrettable but necessary job.

&gt; ""they don't have a day so why should you"" is a rather petty argument

The point is that there are roles who contribute far, far more to society each and every day than the average soldier does over most of his career, and nobody's organising mandatory appreciation days for them.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't appreciate those people (or armed servicemen) for their efforts, but it *is* supposed to invite you to consider why perhaps the armed services get more attention and well-funded, government-approved appreciation days and those people don't.

Perhaps, for example, because it's in the interests of politicians and governments to have a more jingoistic, manipulable population who glorify violent conflict who are always happy to volunteer and available to be sent off to war whenever politicians deem it desirable, instead of a more pacifistic, civilised population who see war as a regrettable last resort and who will protest and fight tooth and nail to avoid armed conflict except in cases of existential threats or clear moral mandates in defence of others.",null,0,null,1435508706,null,0,1435513129,0,cslhujk,null,t3_3baoqq,null,t1_cslhujk,null,t1_cslh58y,null,null,null,1437415610,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The problem with the Stafford inquiry is it incorporates lots of things, which in my opinion came to be lumped together. Some are totally unacceptable - like the mismanagement of diabetic patients and falsification of records, which quite rightly lead to criminal prosecutions. But, other aspects I'm less enamoured with - for example there were numerous examples of elderly patients being left in soiled beds. I know a lot of NHS professionals feel that may have been unfair. It can be surprisingly hard to keep these patients clean, and it reaches a point where if someone is incontinent it's kinder to leave them be for a little while sometimes, rather than constantly be changing them.... Which isn't always practical either. That's a good example of a practice that can seem odd to people that aren't trained. The point is it's not up to patients or relatives to be second guessing what's happening. The NHS has mechanisms both hold itself to account to be held to account. OP certainly doesn't need to start firing off complaints or go playing James Bond at this stage.

FYI, poor communication is regrettable. Failing to spot an avoidable medical emergency like Diabetic ketoacidosis is fucking catastrophic. That's why it isn't up to the general public to decide what's going on. Frankly, and without meaning to be condescending, it's beyond them.

And I understand the interest in family history - my mum has recently been delving into it. Must be harder living the the ""new world"" though as your roots lie so far away.

Williams is a *really* popular Welsh surname. I *think* (now I heard this on the radio, dont take it as gospel) it's due to the fact that in Wales's history, family names came in all of a sudden - before that, people just used their given name. If clarity was needed, they would use their name followed by ""*ap*"" + their father's name.

When people had to chose a surname, many people just dropped the connective and adopted their father's name. As a result, ""ap John"" became Jones, ""ap Evan"" became Evans,  ""ap Dafydd"" became Davies... you get the idea. As a result, simply tracing the ""Williams"" family may be difficult as it is such a popular surname.

And the wish to explore your history is perfectly valid - no one tends to mind people, not least Americans, tracing their roots. If anything, we tend to enjoy people taking an interest in Welsh culture, as Wales gets swept under the rug quite a lot. 

As you may find out, Welsh folk are pretty friendly! Most of us, anyway. I've never been anywhere else where a total stranger can chat with you like they've known you all their lives.

null,false,benshere,english,"England, Sunderland",null,"&gt; zero hour contracts are employment. They work for some people, they don't work for others, just like every other job in history. 

yet they don't come with regular work benefits and all the advantages of the employment go the employer and not the employee? you also have less worker rights and tell me how would you work toward a pension on a zero hour contact?

saying zero hour contracts 'work for some and not for others' is as useful as saying its fine for asian countries to work for buttons in factories because it works for them.

David cameron dodged the question himself, would he work on a zero hour contract? does it not work for him, if not why not?

Most people I know have been forced to zero hour contracts despite working for companies for 5+ years, including managers positions. a store like Argos were 10 staff should be more than adequite has staff of over 50+ despite everyone asking for more hours and regular benefits of a full time position. The times they are given (not requested) can vary from early morning starts, lunch times to closing hours. 6+ years a flat mate of mine has worked for them, 3 of those during university, he never complained but hes no closer to 'working his way up' in the company despite his hard work, never being late and often taking on managers responsibilities.

Zero hour contracts take advantage of entry level, university students and those entering the job market, my flat mate would have fallen into this other 86% of that survey because he wouldnt have the time to take on another job during full time study, however that doesn't mean zero hour contracts made it incredibly more difficult for him to study compared to a normal part time job where hours are regular and not sporadic.

&gt; Around 14% of people on “zero-hours contracts” are looking for another job

Most people are just happy to have a job, it doesn't mean its not a serious abuse of the workers and not what people would have defined as 'employment' not so long ago, its just enough to take them off statistics to spout at the next election.

**&gt; There is a wider argument here about job security, which affects more people:**

Unemployment and employment rates have returned to pre-recession levels.
But the proportion of people in part time employment because they could not find a full time job (16.2%) has not.

He was playing really poor for Liverpool and at the 2010 World Cup, he was by far the worst striker. He couldn't score a single goal for the best team in the world at that time. For fucks sake, he was surrounded by the best midfielders in their prime. Torres was just beyond hopeless. To this day, i don't understand why we spent that much money on a player that was clearly struggling. His greatest asset was his pace. And, after his injuries, he lost that. He was never good at bullying defenders or making good runs in the box. It was too easy to stop him when he couldn't out run defenders. He was so fucking  predictable. He almost always ran with the ball while staring at the ground and eventually losing it to a defender. Other times, he either walked around aimlessly or just hugged the touchlines pretending to be a traditional winger. What kind of striker shies away from the 18 yard box? He had a fragile ego. I don't feel sorry for that fucker, we were the ones who were robbed blind. We gave him lots of opportunities. We even let go a promising striker like Daniel Sturridge. So, that a broken Torres doesn't feel threatened by stiff competition. He still had time to change his playing style. But, i think he was too stubborn to change. It was too late, by the time he realized he needed to change his style. How many managers tried so hard to help him out and failed? No other big club or fan base would have tolerated him that long. What pisses me off the most is that some people still think we actually ruined his career. How can we ruin damaged goods?

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"You can keep anything you want in digital form as long as it is a true facsimile of what a paper record would have shown.

The legislation relevant to direct tax (income tax and corporation tax) that requires you to keep records is S. 12B of TMA 1970.  I'm too lazy to Google the exact wording, but it more or less says you must keep and maintain such records as are required to prepare and submit a tax return which is complete and correct.  The words complete and correct are the important ones in that.

The VAT legislation has a similar wording, **unless** you're using any of the special schemes, in which case they may specify that you must keep particular records.  If this applies make damned sure you follow those requirements **to the letter**.

Again, focussing on direct tax, the principle is that the records you need to keep are dependent on the nature of your business.  If you ran a market stall your note of your opening and closing float and your purchase invoices would be adequate.  *(This is where you potentially start to run into a difference of opinion with HMRC staff, since some will tell you you have to have a record of every individual sale.  They're wrong, but it happens anyway.)*

Ok, so what the legal position will tolerate is more flexible than many people would expect.  **However** if I was your accountant I wouldn't thank you for trying to keep the absolute bare minimum records the law will tolerate.  There will be a sweet spot somewhere between the amount of records that is easy for you to keep and absolutely documenting every last heartbeat.

If you have an accountant, have a word with them about it.  Many will charge you more if your records make preparing your accounts a pain in the arse and even if they don't, a few extra records that make the easy to deal with client will pay dividends in terms of good will.",null,0,null,1435510310,null,0,false,0,cslilhk,null,t3_3be33g,null,t1_cslilhk,null,t3_3be33g,null,null,null,1437416240,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

last comment accidently unedit my edits, so heres the links.

&gt; As adults its up to them to decide that and if their job works for them. 

there is no choice when you need to pay bills and work for minimum wage is the point of the links.

you're saying zero hour contracts are successful because 66% don't want more hours, but they neglect other issues with zero hour contracts that the majority dislike, such as work benefits, lack of pensions etc. 

33% of people do not like the hours of zero hour contracts and have no choice whether they are in one or not. ",null,0,null,1435510532,null,0,1435516095,0,cslipde,null,t3_3beeqt,null,t1_cslipde,null,t1_csliizl,null,null,null,1437416325,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

When it can't exist mutually, it is no longer about equality, but hierarchy. This debates out of context now that final legislation afforded compromise. As I'll reiterate a few times. I'll share with you something I wrote in  /r/ukpolitics:

&gt;*It wasn't about rights though. It was about privilege.*

&gt;*UKIP fought on the basis of religious protection. Which was about defending conscience. The moment a right becomes exclusive, the moment it infringes on another persons right, it becomes a privilege. It is placing one minority above another. Which is against the concept of, on a fundamental level, equality. Equality is not achieved through discrimination. Currently, I believe that the law has an acceptable level of compromise to accommodate both parties. To an extent. Which is why, I believe, UKIP reviewed their stance.*

&gt;*Now I take issue in the prejudice encouraged here. It shouldn't be forgotten that marriage is of polysemous nature, and that misunderstanding can and is exploited to bring hate to the debate. Both sides have legitimate concerns. Both sides have minorities to protect. Laws aren't universal and culture is neither. In which, to my understanding, is why UKIP opposed blanket legislation, or the thought of. It cannot be put into a good versus evil debate, and I could argue that you're not advocating equality when you outright support the notion without consideration. Unknowingly so, in good heart, but unfairly all the matter. Unless promoting the compromise too many couldn't care less for.*

That was in reply to something of similar nature. So forgive the lack of specific context.

I'll emphasise that UKIP have reviewed their stance on the matter since. To which I'm glad with.

I hope I've provided valuable perspective.

null,false,Shaper_pmp,null,null,null,"&gt; It's a bit of a stretch to compare our national outlook on the military to that of the US as it is completely different

That's very true.  However, I submit that the *reason why* our national outlook is so very different from the USAs is because we historically avoid jingoistic or nationalistic celebrations of aspects of our society that are regrettable necessities, while the USA often seems to positively revel in them.

They way we choose to comport ourselves now affects the social environment of subsequent generations growing up.  If we reflect on war as a sombre and tragic event then kids growing up recognise this, and by the time they're old enough to matter they also conceptualise it the same way.  If we treat the armed services as rock-stars and portray war as exciting, glamorous and cool then kids who grow up in that environment are *necessarily* more likely to be jingoistic, nationalistic and in favour of violent conflict.

I'm making a point here about subtle, long-term effects and the way societies often develop over time, so it's not surprising that you're misunderstanding it as ""throwing out numbers of the amount of people killed and cheering"" rather than ""a date in the calendar where we... show some appreciation for what these people do for our country"".

However, my point is that the latter often leads to the former, because most people simply don't carefully parse such occasions as carefully as you'd like them to to avoid falling into exactly that trap.  More accurately, over time nuance and detail is abraded away by popular thoughtlessness and ignorance, and you're left with the key lessons and attitudes, unadulterated by other factors.  Fundamentally it comes down to whether we view war and the people who fight them as ""a profound, regrettable and sad necessity"", or ""a shallow, exciting and cool phenomenon"".

&gt; The armed forces sole purpose is not simply to go and kill people

Sure, in a nuanced, considered worldview they do a lot more than that.  That is, however, their *primary, overwhelming priority and purpose*, and if you say to 100 people ""what is the Army for"" (for example), I suspect you'll get *at least* 99 variations on the theme ""to kill foreigners"" or ""to stop foreigners killing us"", and maybe one guy rambling on about mountain rescue, natural disaster management, firemen strikes and the rest.

This is exactly what I was talking about - the armed services do a whole bunch of stuff, but most people only ever get as far as ""armed services = killing foreigners""... so then you say ""Yay armed services!"" what the overwhelming majority of people hear is ""Yay for killing foreigners!"".

...

As I suspect this is a simple axiomatic difference in our worldviews, let's try another tack instead: why should we start celebrating the Armed Forces now, when they're substantially less necessary and less involved in protecting us (as opposed to projecting force overseas in foreign conflicts) than they have been at practically any point in the last century or more?

And a follow-on thought: don't you find it a bit suspicious that the whole armed services appreciation day was only started in 2006, at the *height* of dissatisfaction with the the Iraq War and popular discontent with the militaristic misadventures of Tony Blair's New Labour government?

And given those two points, what does that suggest about the purpose or intent behind the government-mandated increased jingoism and celebration of armed servicemen and the purpose of their employment, as opposed to (say) Remembrance Sunday's sober, ""never again"" attitude?",null,0,null,1435512343,null,0,1435531489,0,csljkxb,null,t3_3baoqq,null,t1_csljkxb,null,t1_csliqgd,null,null,null,1437416890,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

You never hear women complaining about the lack of women in the less attractive jobs like fire fighting/plumbing/labour/sanitisation. You also don't hear women wanting more men in beauty salons, secretarial roles or wax shops. 

The fact is, men and women have interests in different things...some break the norms...but generally we align in our own ways. Boys like to play with cars and guns as kids and girls like to play tea house and baby dolls. That's just how it is. 

So stop with this ''systematic problem in stem'' bullshit, it's getting tired.

&gt; Abrus precatorius, known commonly as jequirity, Crab's eye, rosary pea, precatory pea or bean, John Crow Bead, Indian licorice, Akar Saga, gidee gidee or Jumbie bead in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, is a slender, perennial climber that twines around trees, shrubs, and hedges. It is a legume with long, pinnate-leafleted leaves.

&gt; The plant is best known for its seeds, which are used as beads and in percussion instruments, and which are toxic due to the presence of Abrin. The plant is native to India and grows in tropical and subtropical areas of the world where it has been introduced.

&gt; The seeds of Abrus precatorius are much valued in native jewelry for their bright coloration. Most beans are black and red, suggesting a ladybug, though other colors are available. Jewelry-making with jequirity seeds is dangerous, and there have been cases of death by a finger-prick while boring the seeds for beadwork.[citation needed]",null,0,null,1435512557,null,0,false,0,csljoon,null,t3_3bev3d,null,t1_csljoon,null,t3_3bev3d,null,null,null,1437416957,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Wetherspoons is great. You can get good priced range of beers anywhere in the country, and their meal nights are always a hit.

No, it's not some hipster speakeasy where you sit on fake cask barrels and have your food delivered on a shovel or roof tile (or whatever is trendy these days), where the drinks are £7 for a half-pint of a 110% hops 'gourmet beer' and indie-as-fuck George Ezraford-and-Sons plays on a loop.

The people who have a problem with Wetherspoons are the ones who think buying jam in a jar with a fabric lid justifies the £6.50 markup, and wine displayed in miniature wooden crates with straw are authentic.

Wetherspoons is great. £1.50 for a pint of Ruddles or £2 for Abotts cannot be beaten.

So you want to live in a world where morals are only for those without merit? Have fun with that one.

&gt;And your bullshit ''systematic problem'' with female in STEM...well why not complain about the lack of women in politics too...

Oddly enough I do, that just has fuck all to do with what I was talking about. This is not a zero sum game either, not that you'd care of course

&gt;the fact that there are some women in both/all fields means it isn't an exclusive club...it's just that not as many women want to be in that field as men..

I didn't say it was an exclusive club, it just happens to often still act like one. 

&gt;You never hear women complaining about the lack of women in the less attractive jobs like fire fighting/plumbing/labour/sanitisation. You also don't hear women wanting more men in beauty salons, secretarial roles or wax shops.

Yes, I do. Don't presume your experience is mine thank you.

&gt;The fact is, men and women have interests in different things...some break the norms...but generally we align in our own ways. Boys like to play with cars and guns as kids and girls like to play tea house and baby dolls. That's just how it is.

Or maybe we as a society ""code"" given things as being for men or for women and we raise children to fit in with those standards. I mean it's not like Boots recently got in trouble for having all the science toys in the ""boys"" section or anything like that... oh... wait...  

&gt;So stop with this ''systematic problem in stem'' bullshit, it's getting tired.

You literally just made a systematic argument for why gender balance in STEM is the way it is...

Nike wouldn't be allowed to own a club and sponsor other clubs. For example, our owners had to divest themselves of Rangers and Slavia Prague last decade because of the potential of conflict of interest.  What would happen if our owners Nike started selling players in exchange for free jersey rights?

EDIT: Also, Nike is a publicly traded company and would have to notify their shareholders if they were attempting to spent a billion dollars to buy a soccer club. Add to that, the fear of the US Dept of Justice investigating Nike's potential bribery to obtain the Brazilian jersey rights and this just doesn't make sense for them right now.

**Re: all the money being spent**

We're one of the largest clubs in Europe making among the most money of any club in the world. It has to be spent somewhere and we may have a big squad, but our wage bill is very small compared to the other 5 big clubs in England.

Plus, look at how low interest rates are at the moment.  The club is getting close to free money to build itself up. It should compare favorable to Arsenal which had to take out loans at much higher interest rates right before the economy blew up (and they had to sit on their residential housing development for years).  Once our stadium is built, we should be able to compete at a top level much quicker than it took Arsenal to get back.

**Re: NFL**

Wembley isn't perfect for the NFL. Spurs see how much money they could potentially make from hosting a NFL team, so they are amending their stadium to potentially be the home of the first non-American NFL team.

Juve isn't because they lost Tevez which was the heart of the team. His team build up was amazing, and he made Juve (along with others) a very formidable side. Even Pirlo is gone, who was a leader and won them vital points even though not having the best season. Then you even have questionable leaves of Pogba, Vidal, and maybe Coleman.

* Stambouli: I don't think he has has had a proper crack but obviously Poch knows more and does not seem to fancy him. Could maybe keep him for Europa and Cup matches?
* Capoue: Should definitely be on his way out due to his attitude. 
* Mason: A good option for depth but we need to find a first team replacement for him who is more defensively minded.
* Dembele: I rate him very much for depth and to help us control games but he can also be pushed a bit further forward and does an okay job there against smaller teams if Eriksen needs a rest, but then are we going to give Pritchard time? 
* Alli: Should probably loan him out again.

At the end of the day, I would prefer Dembele over Delph. If we were to ship out Capoue and get another defensive midfielder in then we should have more than enough depth, especially with some youngsters looking for some time now.

They sort of kind of made it up as they went along most of the time, but for the most part its:

**OS era**: 

Command: Yellow 

Support/Engineering/Ops: Red (I don't remember what there was in terms of security officers in TOS to be perfectly honest, although in Enterprise the security officers wore red, so I assume if there were a security officer on Kirk's Enterprise they would have also)

**TNG Era**:

Sceince/Medical: Blue

Now keeping in mind they changed this around a lot.  In a lot of TOS movies the officers all do wear red.  And some people could have worn colours they otherwise didn't.  Eg. Spock as Second Officer could have also worn yellow, though as science officer Blue also made sense.

&gt;Brazil forward Roberto Firmino struggled against Paraguay
Brazil forward Roberto Firmino struggled against Paraguay
Liverpool new boy Roberto Firmino delivered an ineffective performance before being subbed off as Brazil crashed out of the Copa America on Saturday.
The Reds’ £21.3m signing from Hoffenheim started up front against Paraguay but ended up watching their penalty shootout defeat from the bench after he was replaced by Diego Tardelli on 69 minutes.
Firmino’s display will have done little to convince Liverpool fans he can be the one to reinvigorate their mis-firing attack – the forward didn’t get a shot away during his time on the field and only one of his passes led to a team-mate taking a crack at goal.
Firmino struggled to find a way through the Paraguay defence
Firmino struggled to find a way through the Paraguay defence
The closest he got to contributing to Robinho’s opener was a flailing attempted-flick at Dani Alves’ cross. Fortunately for Brazil, Firmino didn’t get a touch and the former Man City forward was able to convert from close range.
The 23-year-old had fewer touches (39) and a poorer pass completion rate (60 per cent) than any other Brazilian who started the game.
Firmino didn't manage one shot during the game

He did demonstrate his ability to contribute at the other end of the field, completing two tackles, one interception and one clearance but it was a less than inspiring performance from Liverpool’s big-money signing.
As he packs his bags to leave Chile, Firmino will at least be able to reflect on his winner against Venezuela in the first knockout round – but, in all, as for Brazil as a team, the 2015 Copa America has proved to be a frustrating and disappointing tournament for the forward.

They're handily located on town centres for when you need a quick lunch while you're shopping and, during the day at least, even at weekends, you're pretty safe taking offspring in with you for a cheap lunch. They have a few good things on the kids menu, provide colouring pencils and colouring in pages on the kids menu, and if your short one, like mine, wants something off the main menu, it's reasonably priced that you can order it and just ask for fewer chips.

Which brings us on to service, and the caveat, I never, ever, ever, go to a Wetherspoons when it's busy, so the service is usually quick, the staff are helpful and friendly, although in fairness, I belong to a writing group that meets in a city centre Wetherspoons around twice a week, and so the staff know us pretty well when I take offspring in while we're shopping, but even when it's staff I don't know, and in a different town, it's rare we get shit service... Although I'll repeat the caveat. I never go in when it's heaving. That's where people go wrong.

The problem is, people except the same level of service as in a high end gastropub, while its packed to capacity, the staff can't keep up, and because it's cheap, you have people who are drinking more than they otherwise would do, and let's be honest, I'm the same when I'm pissed, drunk people are knobheads. 

So to summarise, it's not that we hate Wetherspoons, it's that we hate drunk people in confined places where the service is getting to be a bit on the shit side because thw staff can't keep up...

From what I've heard, and having spoken to a few people, it's a bit mixed. Some people genuinely don't mind. One thing to keep in mind is that although students tend to be pretty poor neighbours, they're also not likely to commit violent crime against strangers. Generally though people feel pretty negatively, and I think that I would feel the same.

&gt;Quite possibly the worst bit is the fact that some of these overpriced houses aren't occupied the whole year round, there's definitely a large minority with 'to let' signs permanently out the front.

Oh yeah 100%. Not only do all the signs look bad, but it's hard to have a properly cohesive neighbourhood feeling when so many houses are empty. And besides, most students don't really see themselves as members of the local community anyway. The student housing co-op that they set up recently is almost outside of Selly Oak, it's basically in Selly Park. I'm sure part of the reason for that is that the houses in that part of Selly are cheaper, but I wonder if they were thinking about being part of the community when choosing a location.

They certainly shouldn't need to, but it's natural that family members are going to worry. It seems unrealistic to expect them not to care

&gt;The NHS has mechanisms both hold itself to account to be held to account. OP certainly doesn't need to start firing off complaints or go playing James Bond at this stage.

So at which stage is it appropriate? When they've actually come to some harm? I don't see the purpose in waiting if they have serious concerns. At worst he'll make an unfounded complaint. At best a failure will be fixed sooner rather than later. If everything is being done how it should be, then I'm sure they can help address the families concerns once they know they have them.

&gt;You wouldn't walk into a silicone chip factory and tell them they are doing it wrong.

I'm not a silicone chip, so I'm not sure how I should feel about the treatment of silicone chips. What I do know is if I'm extremely unwell in hospital I hope my family would bring up any concerns they had 

&gt;It's too complicated for a lay person to understand.

In your eyes how bad would things have to be before it's suitable for a lay person to find it unacceptable? I'm genuinely curious

&gt;*Gay marriage is equality,*

I agree.

&gt;*trying to make it out to a special right is not worth arguing.*

I'm not arguing that it's a special right. As a right is for all. A ""special right"" is what I call privilege. The term's self refuting.

As I have said. It was the regulation opposed. It was the imposition neither UKIP or I supported. I am all for same sex marriage, but not regulation. **It's about the implementation of it.** It was going to be a blanket regulation disregarding different culture, law and understanding of marriage. It was going to put LGBT expression above religious. Instead of beside it.

&gt;*Now they are all called marriage, thus equality.*

Now they are part of marriage. Civil unions have separate implications.

&gt;*The religious protection argument has been refuted many times over,*

No it hasn't. It's just being misunderstood. Again, again and again.

&gt;*its not a religious right to stop others from doing the same things as you are allowed to do.*

It's a human right, including the religious, to the freedom of expression. I'm allowed to protect that. UKIP is too. You're as well, but the authoritarian behaviour you're expressing doesn't exactly align. It is no one's right to force their idea of marriage onto a performing institution. The two marriages, of same implication, are of the church and civil law. If a church wishes to perform, which many do, I welcome it. Though regulation to enforce a church to perform, which would violate religious conscience, is morally corrupt. People can get married under law. Would you force, for example, a Catholic priest to perform a polygamous marriage to which he repelled? Despite there being other institutions to perform it.

&gt;*the fact that religious people receive these special rights in the first place goes against the idea of equality (tax breaks, public money on religious schools etc).*

Religions didn't receive these ""rights"" first. I believe marriage came around long before. However, religion adopted an expression of their beliefs, of marriage, which they should be allowed. Otherwise, it's stinking hypocrisy. Imagine having choose between *the* law and your law. You either go to prison for life or hell for after. That's what such regulation imposes, and to call that tolerant is, for minorities of each strain, inexcusable.

Thank you for taking the time to reply. 

Would it make a difference if she booked (as is my understanding) ""the month after my operation"" as opposed to ""one month from xxx"".

Initially the operation was scheduled for the 15th. It was put back to the 22nd. During that time she was allowed to work. On the 22nd it was put back to the 13th. Since the 22nd she has been told that she should not return to work.

As for the quitting comment - there is a 3month notice period. If for whatever reason the operation is delayed further, then surely she would be allowed to return to work otherwise she would be effectively on gardening leave?

I do apologise in advance if anything I mention now was pertinent before, as I say I am posting this on behalf of my partner and I may have missed relevant information.

I'm not a big fan of 'spoons and will avoid them where I can (if 20 people from work are all going I wont sit in another pub alone).

* Their sourcing of beer is in many ways questionable. I've worked at breweries where they will massively undercut price buying barrels or beer that are just about to go off. As a brewery we still lost money selling those barrels. Admittedly, getting some money was good, but 'spoons just coming in and paying full price would have been nice (like all the local small pubs).
* Their beer tends to be kept in poor condition. Don't get me wrong, some (branches? franchises? houses?) do a good job of it. Others do a terrible job. To the point where as an ale drinker, I've told people who want to try ale not to bother in certain pubs. As I know the pint will be off. To 'spoons credit, I've never had a problem sending poor beer back. But it shouldn't have been poor in the first place.
* The food is about as mediocre and bland as you can be. I don't understand why other countries look down on British food so much, then I order food at weatherspoons. It's not that it's bad/offensive in any way, it's just that it's so meh I can't be bothered with it. No doubt some 'spoons are better than others.
* The customer base, it stretches to the abusive and exploitative in some 'spoons. I wont push strongly on the argument myself because drinkers are adults and can make their own decisions. But when beer is 2/pint and 'spoons is open at 10am, you get all the town drunks queueing up at the door to get their fix.
* I don't feel the need to go out so strongly that I'll put up with all of the above. I'd prefer to go out once a week to a good pub, with better quality beer with a good chef and with nice customers. Rather than go out twice a week to 'spoons. Does this mean I'm ""overpaying"" in the smaller pub? Maybe.
* 'Spoons competitive practices are in places outright viscous. They are very much using their size to out compete smaller pubs until they can meet their slim margins. In some places this has meant offering landlords over market value for their premisis, and crowding highstreets with the one chain. Owning two or three locations within view of each other. Operating those locations at a loss until no-one is left to compete with them. Some call it fair business, I think it's at detriment to culture.

[edit] As a side note, I don't believe 'spoons shouldn't be allowed to do the above. It's a free market they can do as they please.

null,false,benshere,english,"England, Sunderland",null,"&gt;Would you force, for example, a Catholic priest to perform a polygamous marriage to which he repelled? Despite there being other institutions to perform it.

the problem with this argument is that religion is entirely subjective on which parts it wishes to enforce and not enforce, whats to stop a priest from arguing to marry people based on the colour of their skin or the fact they eat shellfish and got a haircut like it says in leviticus. What if someone invents a religion tomorrow, is theirs less valid, can they put in whatever clause they want and discriminate accordingly?

the priest is picking and choosing which religious text he wants to enforce, so it not a standard to enforce by law, especially when he has no proof to the existance of his god and therefore his religion.

As you say marriage was around long before religion and the definition has changed many times, priests have been changing what they do and don't do for years, its hypocrisy to start claiming their is a traditional definition.",null,0,null,1435517624,null,0,false,0,cslm6rk,null,t3_3be4tn,null,t1_cslm6rk,null,t1_csllmbs,null,null,null,1437418810,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Politics today is really concerned with identity (but not exclusively), and how certain demographs are either over represented (Conservatives, Labour and SNP) or under represented (UKIP, LIBDEMS and Greens.)

In the 80/90/00 Labour would have a large amount of votes from the white (because the majority of the country is white) working class males due to trade unions, loss of blue collar jobs and a sense of comradely in knowing that everyone in your street is in a similar position. A large amount of this vote has gone to UKIP and to a lesser extent Tory.

But the bigger problem I feel is that our society doesn't let people(especially children) know that they are allowed to make up their own minds. People are born into religion and for the most part accept it until they die.

We give children religious identifiers and then attack that religion for what it is. We're never given a choice. Why try to reform a terrible religion instead of telling people(especially children) that they are not actually anchored to it? Why try and reform it instead of letting people know that it can and most likely will be abandoned? 

Edit: I realise I went on a tangent, but I'm going to leave it as I'm honestly not sure on how to respond to your comment. There is that Maajid Nawaz Bloke that was on question time that posted pictures of the Paedophile mohammed much to the dissatisfaction of many muslims worldwide. So I mean opposition within Islam does exist. But why when the majority of young white westerners are abandoning religion in of favour atheism, a personal god or just plain apathy should we be reforming a bronze age tradition based on a frankly crappy origin story for 'muslims'?

its important to do stuff you enjoy, as well as that which challenges your brain; work hard at them all.

i hope you find some time to join some clubs and try new things, too, like climbing, fencing, etc. there will be clubs for college newspaper, media production etc which means you'll still be able to pursue your journalism interests. in fact, with a strong list of A levels and good work in extra circulars, you'll look even better than if you'd just done media studies but no outside interests. have you had a look at the list of activities on offer at both your school and the college? i just had a look at a couple of 6th form colleges and media related stuff was well covered at both.

And as for character and drunks, I don't see Wetherspoons as any better or worse than any other randomly chosen pub. They are both down to the particular clientele that that branch happens to attract.

When I moved here, there were pubs at both ends of my road. Both of them were truly awful - one typically had about 6 old men in it and a choice of about 2 lagers, a stout and a creamflow bitter. In the 5 years before it closed, I probably went in there less than half a dozen times.

Absolutely!  If Islam could adapt itself to new information then it would be as harmful as a cup of tea.  

&gt;But the bigger problem I feel is that our society doesn't let people(especially children) know that they are allowed to make up their own minds.

Also agree with that.  Not sure it's completely society's fault, but we could be doing a much better job of helping those who have been indoctrinated from birth.

&gt;Why try and reform it instead of letting people know that it can and most likely will be abandoned?

Good question!  

Honestly, I think a mixture of approaches are needed.  We need to encourage the reformers in the hope that they will be able to bring some improvement to the Islamic world.  But we also need to protect and stand with those who want to leave this outdated ideology.  

Let's try everything and see what works.

As far as I can tell, this is completely irrelevant to the discussion. Why would Muslims have to apologise for people who shared their skin colour? Why are you so special?

Does that really matter? In all likelihood you are a product of a culture that has been heavily-influenced by Christianity (you are commenting in a thread on /r/unitedkingdom. I don't know your individual background but this doesn't detract from my overall point that this is ridiculous). You are Christian enough in the eyes of an ignorant outsider because you celebrate Christmas, just as a young British Turkish Cypriot who celebrates Eid is close enough to the Muslim community to be criticised by ridiculous people for not condemning every Islamist terrorism incident.

So, the incidents I mentioned above were perpetrated by people who identified themselves as Christians. Many of them are the product of a culture very similar to the one that you are a product of, some of them don't even have the same skin colour as you so you should have no moral problems in your acceptance of group responsibility. So I ask again, can you please apologise for those terrible things? They were perpetrated by fringe members of certain demographics and you can be described as a moderate member. You, by your own logic, share the blame. So please apologise. If you refuse, then apply some critical thinking before you start blaming moderate Muslims for the actions of a few lunatics.

At the end of the day, you have to give the hospital a chance. Too often people turn up in hospitals and start mouthing off about how X, Y and Z hasn't been done... it isn't necessary. There are 1.2 million people working in the NHS. They deal with 1 million patients every 36 hours. Relatives turn up in hospital and start telling people who've been working there 60 hours a week for decades of their life how to do it... chances are, the staff have got a pretty good idea how to do their jobs. The NHS is an incredibly advanced healthcare system that has what you can think of as its own quality assurance processes. It shouldn't be, and isn't necessary, for relatives to have to ""fight your corner"" against the NHS. The vast vast vast majority of times there are legitimate explanations for why things are being done in a certain way, and when you are frightened, in an unfamiliar environment, scared about your loved ones it can be overwhelming... but that doesn't mean its your place to start deciphering whats going on and ""make it work"".

&gt; At worst he'll make an unfounded complaint

Dealing with unrealistic explanations, pushy-relatives etc. all consumes time that really ought to be spent doing what hospitals are meant to do. You don't need to raise complaints in these sorts of situations in the first instance. What you need to do is actually talk to someone, establish whats going on and then re-evaluate what your seeing.

&gt; All organisations are going to have failings now and then, no matter how perfect they are.

Yes, they do. Silicone chip factories have failings. Do you walk in off the street and point them out? No. Because you aren't equipped to do that (assuming you don't work in semiconductor manufacturing). **The OP needs to give the hospital a chance basically.** They certainly have unanswered questions, and the person to speak to is the nurse looking after their father in law. If that doesn't satisfy their answers then the nurse in charge of the ward. If that doesn't work they can raise it with the patients consultant or the modern-matron on Monday. If they STILL aren't satisfied with the outcome of that, then they should seek advice through PALS. At no point is it necessary or useful to contact the chief executive.

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;Can anyone provide me a few examples of people calling for the resignation of Tim Hunt or the shirt guy?

Bit hard to find someone calling for Hunt's resignation given that it happened so quickly after his remarks, but you can certainly find examples of bloggers gloating that he was pushed out.  For instance, Ophelia Benson of Freethought Blogs has written perhaps 15 posts about Hunt, in which she shows no remorse whatsoever for the predicament he found himself in and uses phrases like:

[&gt;UCL did the right thing. Tim Hunt is acting like an entitled petulant baby.](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2015/06/ucl-has-a-commitment-to-gender-equality/#more-20400)

And she's castigated anyone who publicly defended Hunt as being apologists for sexism.  

Not a very pleasant woman and not someone who I'd ever, ever wish to disagree with under my real name.  She's absolutely vindictive and will go after anyone she disagrees with.  Freethought Blogs also has a long record of making very dodgy rape accusations against famous atheists, so there's that.

Edit:  And here's a charming Guardian comment piece:

[Stop Defending Tim Hunt](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/23/stop-defending-tim-hunt-brian-cox-richard-dawkins)

&gt;Next eight Nobel laureates, plus the ubiquitous Richard Dawkins, have come out in support of Hunt. There are over 2,000 signatures on an online petition to reinstate him to his honorary post at UCL. Contrast this with 200+ signatures on a petition that I started calling on the Royal Society to elect its first female president. The Nobel eight made an idiotic attempt to equate the upset caused by Hunt’s ill advised and sexist comments with some kind of “chilling effect” on academics.

&gt;This is an absurd idea and deserves to be outed for what it is, a deeply cynical attempt to say that scientists can do and say what they like. In the name of academic freedom? Is science so special that any old sexist (or for that matter racist) words that they utter are allowed? The answer is and must be a resounding no.

Dripping with contempt for anyone who has publicly defended Hunt.  Apparently Nobel Laureates and Richard Dawkins made an 'idiotic attempt' to defend him and their defense of tolerance is making them 'cynical' apologists for sexism.

Fair criticism?  Well, you be the judge.  Would you think it fair if people who stood for a cause that you support were castigated in such terms?  Let's imagine 10 eminent female professors stood up to support a controversial feminist and they were subsequently vilified in the Telegraph as idiots and apologists hiding under the defense of free-speech and academic freedom.

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"I read a few interesting columns in the aftermath of the Tim Hunt controversy that complained a lot about how ""free speech"" was being taken away from him, and while I think I agree that the reaction was far too vitriolic and, well, reactionary, it wasn't a free speech issue.  This is the other side of the free speech coin - when a person uses their free speech, other people will use their right not to listen, and indeed their right to speak freely about how the first person's free speech was wrong.  Which, again, is perfectly permissible under absolute free speech laws.

But Tim Hunt was hounded out of his job in a process that increasingly began to look like a witch-hunt, and there have since been suggestions that his comments were actually incredibly supportive of women's rights in the STEM industry.  So something clearly went wrong and free speech didn't protect him.

Similarly, the Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich was forced to resign after he donated to an anti-gay marriage campaign.  And it raises huge questions, because him being forced out for a private, personal opinion seems very wrong to me.  But then if someone like Rupert Murdoch were hired as Mozilla CEO, I would be very happy to see him resign, and a large part of that is because of his personal, private(ish) opinions.

And then you've got the people for whom free speech will do nothing.  I have had an incredibly privileged and lucky background, and my voice (or at least, voices that will willingly and easily represent me) is loud and will be heard as a result of it.  But I went to school with a large number of people who will never go to university, never get into positions where anyone will listen to them, and will not be represented at many levels in their lives.  What the fuck is free speech doing for them?  Sure, they can talk, but nobody's listening, so why the fuck should they do it?

So, honestly, I've never been a huge fan of this modern concept of free speech.  I understand that it's necessary and important, and I understand why we can't stop people from speaking, but we shout about it so much as if, beyond simply safeguarding those who would otherwise be banned, it might one day give voice to those who are simply silent.  And it doesn't.  It cannot give anyone voice who cannot be heard, it only prevents us from preventing other voices.  I've long held that there's always a responsibility for every right, and actually once we have the right we should stop worrying about that and start ensuring that our corresponding responsibility is met, and here our responsibility is to listen.  Not to everyone, of course, because there's several billion voices right now, and more on their way, but certainly representatively.  The more time we spend talking, the less time we're going to be able to spend listening, and the less credence we will give to our responsibility to hear others.

I don't know how to go about doing this, and I really want to go and watch Humans right now, so this is going to end on a really shitty note, but fuck it, I really wanted to say that, and this.  We need a massive culture shift, both here in the UK, and also across the world (and particularly the internet, which has inherited a lot of the US fetish for rights).  There's a certain truth to what teachers say when they go on about the whole ""two ears and one mouth"" thing - we *need* to spend more time listening to others.  Only when we start listening to other viewpoints and other opinions are we going to be able to get over this crippling fear of offending others and upsetting an otherwise perfect worldview.

Prior to digital media these groups had to solely rely on mainstream media putting out their propaganda which is why we tend to find their actions are more 'aggrandised' (think 9/11). Now, however, digital media enables almost real-time coverage through an unfiltered lense, which means that acts committed by these groups are now more purposeful (ie they can do whatever they want rather than focus on what is 'attractive' to the media) as an organisation, and the 'lone wolf' phenomenon has replaced the need for aggrandised acts.

First I've heard of these races to be honest, but yeah despite your snark and clearly having never looked into it, it looks pretty good. Electric racecars with limited amounts of power to actually hammer down with. Pit stops involve getting into a ready-charged car rather than refuelling your current one.

Apparently also racers can get a ""fan boost"" as a result of a vote, which gives them an extra bit of race speed power. If you over-extend and run out of racing power your car is basically gimped by race rules until you can get into the pit stop, so it's a fine balancing act that seems to deal with the intricacies of fuel pit stops in an interesting way.

The ""I"" debate would be important if you're looking at it from a perspective or religion, but the key thing for ISIS is the ""S"" debate.

You can see that the 'State' is the primary aim by their propaganda btw.

It's not like they ""lost"" him, they willingly chose to sell him, because they wanted to move on from him. Griezmann hasn't left yet, and there's a pretty significant chance he doesn't leave, same with Arda Turan, and also, you're forgetting they got replacements for these guys with Vietto and also Oliver Torres (aka the next Koke) coming back from loan. Not only that, but they play a specific system which is hard to beat, and they play it really, really well. I reject the idea that they aren't arguable. 

Juve again, I reject the idea that we are definitively better than them, we definitely weren't this year, our midfield wouldn't be strong enough against theirs. Yes, Tevez is a huge loss, and they probably won't be able to replace him adequately next year, but they brought in Dybala who tore up Serie A before he knew he was getting transferred and then mailed it in for the rest of the season, and he's going to get even better support there. Pirlo is gone, but as any Juventus fan will tell you, Juventus were actually better when he wasn't playing, because he was a liability defensively, and while Marchisio doesn't have quite the range of passing that Pirlo does, he's more than capable of filling Pirlo's role, and they now have Khedira, who everybody seems to undervalue, but is a very good box-to-box midfielder who will fit Juve perfectly. And again, Pogba and Vidal haven't left yet. They may, but it's not exactly likely, and you're operating under the assumption that they've already left. 

&gt; I can call it now, they aren't making it passed the quarterfinals next year.

This is what everybody said about Atleti last year and Dortmund the year before. They had nice runs, they did really well in that year, but they won't duplicate their success. Well they both ended up making the QFs the next year, and both BARELY lost to Real Madrid in that round. I think you're also underestimating the change in manager. Allegri is a very good manager, he's taken a static Juve team that was always top of Serie A, but not able to perform in Europe, and got them to within 90 minutes of completing a treble in his first season. 

As for PSG, they DOMINATED us across both legs in midfield and for most of the match. If not for some of those incredible saves by Courtois, we probably lose without the away goals tiebreaker.

Ok well, from my experience most British muslims either haven't read the Quran or if they have they don't have any( and I mean any) understanding of classical arabic in which the Quran is written. But there definitely is a widespread acceptance that it is the unalterable word of god. Most just apply there own moral code to it and assume thats probably what it says. If you show them a particularly disagreeable segment of the Quran that either becomes 'their' view or they have a mini crisis of conscience and try to find a way of reinterpreting it. 

But in my travels through the middle east, talking with people that have actual knowledge of the Quran they vehemently defend any part of the Quran because its gods words. 

It's the fact that the Quran was supposedly dictated to mohammed which makes it the undeniable truth. Which makes it unique among abrahamic religions to which Judaism, Christianity and Islam belong( as well as some others). While in christianity you have the bible which is a collection of books written sometime after jesus had passed, so it might be acceptable to ignore parts as being incorrect. Islam's raison d'etre is that it was in a way authored by god so it can't be wrong. It see's itself as the restoration of the original religion of adam. Also the main addition made to Islam from Judaism and Christianity is the divinely dictated mandate to subjugate the non-believers.( Either through taxation or death).


TL;DR You can't argue with god. The dictation by god was to avoid reformation which would be a corruption of the message of god. This was to address what was seen as the corruption that happened to christianity/the bible.

The fact of the matter is that technology is at a point where a human can hurtle around a track in a machine doing the absolute upper limit of what we can safely endure and even then there are massive risks associated. Some drivers lose around 5lb just in WATER during a race. Heat fatigue can easily kill if the team isn't prepared.

It's not just about building the biggest, fastest engine any more. Racing is on a plateau technology wise where the difference is now measured in milliseconds rather than horsepower. There's a massive amount of technicality and what some would call metagame in racing. When you take your pit stop is now infinitely more important to the outcome of a race than the top speed of your car.

You want to see idiots driving around a track and getting hurt? Watch NASCAR. Oh wait, they do exactly the same thing, because their races are on the same type of technological level.

What you want is demolition derby. Let's face it, you just want to watch racing where you can enjoy white trash trailer park shit and cars getting smashed into without admitting to it, but that's OK.

&gt;&gt;*Would you force, for example, a Catholic priest to perform a polygamous marriage to which he repelled? Despite there being other institutions to perform it.*

&gt;*the problem with this argument is that religion is entirely subjective*

That's religion. That's expression. That's my life. That's your life. That's life. Why do you deserve more value?

&gt;*on which parts it wishes to enforce and not enforce,*

That's religion once again. That's expression once again. You're allowed to hold a belief and the fact that it is a belief doesn't mean it deserves suppression. Providing that it doesn't impose on or infringe someone else's rights. In which, Christian marriage doesn't, considering its lack of exclusivity.

You can get married both under civil law and the church. All that would be different is who would be performing. What's wrong with that? Why are you so keen to force with the threat of persecution? You're advocating equality, right?

&gt;*whats to stop a priest from arguing to marry people based on the colour of their skin*

Social norm. You'd get the Twitter hate mob after his head.

&gt;*or the fact they eat shellfish*

**They don't need to practice that religion if they don't like it**. It is a belief, it is an expression, leave it the alone. You can't decide what someone isn't not allowed to or decides not to eat. 

&gt;*and got a haircut like it says in leviticus.*

I'll reiterate, you can't force yourself into a belief, or suppress them till they let you hang around. You don't need to join their religion if you don't want to. If you want to practice, either convince them or get the bleeding haircut.

&gt;*What if someone invents a religion tomorrow, is theirs less valid*

No. Providing that they don't impose beliefs, infringe welfare or incite violence.

&gt;*can they put in whatever clause they want*

They can. To an extent. Providing blah blah blah (read above). As long as they don't violate the law. They're allowed.

&gt;*and discriminate accordingly?*

They are. To quote:

*""Providing that they don't impose beliefs, infringe welfare or incite violence."" ~ Sir Kiwi*

You don't have to be a part of that religion. People can be married without the clergy. Plenty support though.

&gt;*the priest is picking and choosing which religious text he wants to enforce,*

That's @#$%\^&amp;+ religion. Should we force Sikhs to comply with Hindus now?

&gt;*so it not a standard to enforce by law,*

Providing that the religion doesn't interfere with the law or our rights. They are allowed to practise.

&gt;*especially when he has no proof to the existance of his god and therefore his religion.*

So this just boils down to a difference in opinion? What happened to the ""tolerance"" you are all fighting for?

&gt;*As you say marriage was around long before religion and the definition has changed many times,*

I never said that. I said that there are many concepts and definitions.

&gt;*its hypocrisy to start claiming their is a traditional definition.*

I never said that either. ""Marriage"" consists of multiple ideas. Why should one impose on the other? Why can't they coexist? What happened to liberty? Convince. Don't intimidate.

I'll stress that, in the UK, it doesn't matter too much now. In that the law was passed with compromise. Putting both expressions of marriage near enough equal. Though don't go slandering UKIP.

I agree with the other comments posted here, talk to you lenders, and get advice rather than just defaulting. You want to repair your credit rating from now on, not make it worse.

And no, I haven't given up on the prospect for a reformation.  I still think that all approaches need to be tried.  They all have their problems, but I'm hopeful that something will work.

Honestly, I'm an optimist.  Islam is a tremendous problem, but the liberal world will find a way through.  Throw enough resources and academics at any problem and you can usually make some headway.

Of course, the other distinct possibility is that the Islamic world will collapse by itself.  Perhaps it won't be able to resist the tide of cheap-internet and iPhones and porn-videos and all the other great comforts of modern life.  No doubt living a life of repentance and devotion has its attractions, but given the option, I suspect that most kids would prefer to have an iPhone 6S and access to Porntube.

Lastly, I guess there  two things which I think we should be doing right now:

i) Preserve freedom of speech.  If that goes, then we're in serious trouble.  If criticism of religion becomes protected by hate-speech laws then I fear for what could happen.

ii) We need to stand with ex-muslims and critics of Islam.

you're claiming that you're being oppressed by not having the ability to discriminate, think about for a second.

&gt; They don't need to practice that religion if they don't like it. It is a belief, it is an expression, leave it the alone. You can't decide what someone isn't not allowed to or decides not to eat.

thats fine and dandy if they keep as a personal belief and it doesn't effect anyone, but the offer services to the public, receive public money (from atheists) and operate in a church that they don't own. They are free to believe exactly what they want, they do not however have the right to use that belief to discriminate.

if a gay religious couple want to get married in a church, then they can. if a straight atheist (also against all major religions) couple wants to get married in a church they can.

I didn't like that some of the links to 'research' didn't directly link to the research you were talking about, but instead to Amazon books. I'll read the research but I'm unlikely to read an arbitrary selection of books to reaffirm what you've written. If you do want to promote books, make it clear that's what you're doing before I visit your link.

Your link that says ""Well, that’s simply not true"" links to an anecdote on Youtube with very little views and I expected it to link to some kind of article with 'truth' value. I realise now it's your own Youtube channel. If a truth statement is made and hyperlinked, it better be to research or evidence that backs up that claim.

Another of your links is to another of your articles, when I expected it to be a link to research. Internet users generally don't like these kinds of surprises! If you want to promote yourself or cross-link to other articles you've written, make it clear that's what you're doing.

You support your article with a link to spirituality.ucla.edu which seems to have a biased agenda towards prioritizing religion in schools which I don't think is what you were going for.

&gt;So believing in God and going to church is not the only way to attain a strong sense of life purpose and meaning. You can gain it in venues that are secular and provide an opportunity for community ties and a chance to reflect on life purpose and meaning just as religious communities have traditionally offered.

This statement seemed like quite weak way to start a paragraph, and now I'm not sure what type of reader you are aiming at.

The purpose of the article isn't clear - Is it to be an informative feature, a historical narrative? Is it aimed at religious readers?

NO THEY'RE NOT. YOU ARE, ONCE AGAIN, JUDGING PEOPLE BY PERSON.

To your logic, all Muslims advocate IS, I think not!

&gt;*they protested gay marriage,*

That doesn't make them homophobic. More accurately, they protested the regulation of gay marriage, which was about protecting expression. They fought it on a the ground of religious conscience.

&gt;*therefore they are not welcome at the pride event.*

So they are not allowed to support the LGBT due to promoting equality?

&gt;*pride is not about ""tolerance and acceptance"" as you've asserted, it is specifically about tolerance and acceptance for LGBT people.*

Yes it fucking is.

You seem to advocate privilege.

It's hypocrisy at best to expect acceptance while not willing to return. Tolerance is a two way street. Just like equality.

&gt;*not including a famously homophobic party in the Pride marches is not hypocritical. that's ridiculous.*

They had a famous bigot or two. Party though? I'd disagree.

Unfair scrutiny, contextomy, coverage etc.

Labour are infamous for child molesters. Are you suggesting that that some 9.4 million people all share these skeletons? I, again, think not.

&gt;*as I've said elsewhere this is what Pride London website says:*

&gt;*""Pride in London celebrates the LGBTQ+ community.""*

&gt;*therefore, including a platform for a party who campaigned against gay marriage and is consistently in the media for homophobic speech would be inappropriate.*

I wish I could emphasise, as an academic in such production, that most of the news at ten is a load of misconstrued bullshizzle. Again, we didn't campaign against gay marriage, but the regulation of it.

&gt;*can't quite believe you honestly think that Pride organisers and the gay community have some sort of responsibility to represent UKIP at their parade.*

They wouldn't be. UKIP would represent themselves. They have the responsibility to be fair. In which, considering the Conservative's traditional sector (anti marriage/pro conscience), Labour's phile sector (just bad rep), Islam's IS sector (stoning gays and dropping them of buildings, even the friendlier ones often see it as sin) and Christianity's anti marriage sector, fair doesn't seem to be the case. I do welcome them all there, but if you single-out UKIP, that is just discrimination.

If they actually want to promote tolerance. They should allow invite the UKIP body and try reform the party. Try dissolve the homophobic attitudes it may attract and weaken further promote an equal society.

&gt;*it's laughable, get some sense.*

Get some sense?

As for the culture 'bomb' solution, I know in theory it sounds great but with the truly indoctrinated it would probably cause greater internal strife which would lead to grandiose acts of violence to repent for enjoying booze and porn. I mean with the western attacks that we're familiar with that must have some part to play. The black lad from London that beheaded Lee Rigby would most likely have enjoyed British life before deciding they wanted to commit one of the most needlessly violent attack that I personally have ever heard of. And there's that Pakistani hate preacher( I forget his name ) that has pictures of hime living the good life( Larger and lads' mags ) in his younger years. Our way of life( If you don't mind me calling it that) apparently isn't as appealing as we'd like to think.

I think the increase in number of attacks in recently are a direct result of us allowing ISIS to exist at all after having declared war on the west and actually murdering two white(which is important in this case) westerners infront of a western audiance with no ral media coverage of any punishment they might have faced. 

I mean if you look at ISIS objectively from an uneducated extremist's point of view. Here's what you see:

* ISIS a new ISLAMIC state, with a caliph and everything


* ISIS horrifically murders two white men by hacking at their necks with a blunt knife in HD and production quality that far surpasses any propaganda that has ever been seen. In front of an audience that includes the entire world.

* Claims of airstrikes against ISIS but no video evidence.

Again, this will depend on their status. Many zero hours contracts will be for employees.

You can't just say ""you are a worker, not an employee"", it depends on your what your work involves and how much control you have over it.

I agree with the CDM talk, we need someone else in there, I feel we are more likely to buy youngish (24 years old and under) in that position which will limit our options in terms of established names. Although I'd be interested in a player like Axel Witsel if the price is right and he is willing to forgo the CL for Prem football. Seen us linked to Cabaye recently which I feel would be worth a shot depending on the price.

Get Kono and Mirallas in as AM, that'll free up some players (Lennon, Townsend?) in a part exchange with West Brom for Berahino.

Ideally I would like another CF behind Kane but I don't see us offloading both Ade and Soldado unless we virtually give them away so I'd imagine (probably Ade) will end up staying.

As for who I'd offload, well it's quite a list but assuming these transfers happen I'd happily let the following go;
Kaboul, Vlad, Lennon, Paulinho, Soldado, Ade, Holtby (didn't realise he was still on the books), Townsend (if he's a makeweight in a deal, not sure I'd just let him walk for money), and Capoue. I wouldn't say no to Stambouli leaving either if we sign someone else as Carroll and maybe even Dele Alli will be in the squad next year.

These issues are never so cut and dry as that, the lack of respect for achievement can in large parts be driven by soft pressure from the entrenched culture.

Don't know about you but I doubt that would have happened if he'd be covered in pictures by Tom of Finland.

This guy isn't being pushed out he career, he said sorry and the only people still banging on about it are those who don't think he should have apologised.

Read Steven Pinker's 'Better Angels of our Nature' or David Deutsch's 'Beginnings of Infinity'.  Although you might not believe it, the world is getting better and violence and war are receding.  

Yes, Islam is an insanely difficult problem, but problems can be solved - and generally do get solved in cases where our lives depend on it.

There are massive developments happening in almost real time which could have enormous implications for Islam.  The Islamic world is becoming significantly more educated and it's being flooded with information via the internet.  Health and wealth are also on the rise.

And look at the UK.  Thirty people dying in an attack is significant, but it's practically nothing compared to the other threats we face.  99.99% of us are still going to die from mundane causes like heart disease and cancer and not because of some spectacular terrorist attack.  

Ultimately, I think that Islam as we now know it will eventually be beaten by better ideas.  I can't predict if it will change or whether it will simply disappear, but it will be beaten.  Bad ideas always are.

The only thing that Islam has got going for it is that it's got inbuilt survival mechanisms.

First of all there's literally more than 9 weeks to go in the transfer window so having two deals done **BEFORE JULY** is crazy for Spurs, usually it's the first 2 or 3 weeks in July you might see a transfer or 2 become official. 

Secondly, how do you know the club aren't doing enough? Are you a part of the transfer team? As I already mentioned, two signings this early is pretty unusual taking recent history (about 5ish years although my memory could be wrong) so clearly far more is being done to get deals done early in comparison to previous years.

Thirdly, [take a look](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2v7qkd/post_jan_14151516_summer_transfer_window/) through. ""Rumours"" mean fuuuuck all, Stambouli for example came out of nowhere, nobody mentioned him last year then Montpellier announced it on twitter.

Lucas played well in most games he was used in, but because Rodgers doesn't like to play with a true DM he didn't play as much as he should have.

I think the main concern with Benteke is that its a lot of money to spend on someone that people aren't convinced that Rodgers truly wants.

[Debuchy, sprained ankle. Out for 12 weeks](http://giant.gfycat.com/OrganicBlackandwhiteCobra.gif)

[Debuchy, unnecessary tackle caused shoulder injury. Out for 11 weeks](http://gfycat.com/DismalArcticImperatorangel)

&amp;nbsp;

Would you not call these unlucky? No medical team in the world could prevent injuries like Debuchy's, being pushed out of play or Wilshere getting his ankle mawled. All of these injury lasted at least 3 months and that is excluding time to regain fitness after being out for so long (although many had quick recoveries after healing this season). These are also only injuries from this season, broken body parts from dangerous tackles saw Ramsey, Sagna, Eduardo, Diaby etc. out for years combined. You also mention that the difference between Chelsea and Arsenal is that Chelsea adapt to their injuries. This is not only a ludicrous statement but also one which makes no sense. Could you please amuse me in elaborating how Arsenal has not adapted to injuries this past year.  ^^^I ^^^also ^^^come ^^^in ^^^peace, ^^^I ^^^promise^.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Isn't the greatest need for more housing with connections to london? High speed means less stations, a slower line with multiple new towns along the route would be much more beneficial that just a few minutes quicker to birmingham.

But where's the money for the new towns coming from? That's a different topic.

Thing is, building a high speed line isn't appreciably more expensive than a low-speed line. In some respects it's actually cheaper (more powerful high speed trains can negotiate steeper inclines than low speed trains, requiring less earthmoving and civil engineering).

The price tag looks huge and extravagant, but if you consider that a low speed line is only going to be a few percent cheaper, you suddenly wonder if you're being penny-wise, pound-foolish. It's not as though a new low speed line is only going to cost 20% of High Speed alternative. The huge bulk of the cost is in land acquisition and physical infrastructure (rails and overhead wires). Whether you set those up for wide High Speed trains or conventional rolling stock is neither here nor there.

Indeed, penny-wise, pound-foolish is what they're doing by ditching the interconnect with HS1.

The case for HS2 is flaky. Does it matter if you cut the Manchester-London run by 45 minutes?

By contrast, a straight-through Manchester-Paris route is a whole new service and capability. To do that now you'd have to go to London, negotiate the tube and not miss your connection. A straight-through service of under 4 hours would be a seriously competitive alternative to flying (2 hours fucking about in the airport, 90minute flight, and 60 minutes on the RER to get from CDG into Paris. As compared to pitching up to the station, getting on a train and settling in with a movie on your laptop before being delivered direct to Gard du Nord).

Considered this way, it absolutely makes sense to go with the High Speed option. You get your extra capacity, and a new capability set (and hopefully they'll hook it up to HS1 some day so it's actually useful). If you need extra housing with a rail link to London, then you can run that along the existing lines - which will have additional capacity available from people moving onto HS2.",null,0,null,1435531773,null,0,false,0,csltj7t,null,t3_3bf6d3,null,t1_csltj7t,null,t1_cslo2ye,null,null,null,1437422618,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

Edit:  Here's another comment from the Stack Exchange discussion:

&gt;It doesn't matter how many different authorities/style guides are cited - usage in this area has never been fixed, so it doesn't mean much to suggest the ""rule has changed over time"".

&gt;The use of apostrophes has always been less common, but it's been around at least a century (there, for example, the 1700's). It's also worth noting that (particularly in earlier years) writers would sometimes simply leave a space (i.e. - write the 1700 s).

&gt;Per other answers, I suggest only using the apostrophe in contexts where not doing so would make things hard to read (as in dotting the i's and crossing the t's). That's in line with my understanding that the general trend over many decades has been a reduction in the use of all punctuation where the primary justification was to follow ""rules of grammar"". Increasingly, the primary (or only) justification for punctuation marks is improved legibility.

I'm betting there wouldn't be much of an issue if they weren't starting fires and drinking. And yes, I know the solution to this would seem to be to ""find them somewhere to live"". 

It isn't always that simple. Once they've been prosecuted for breaking some small law like public drinking, or being belligerent when told to stop drinking, they stop being a victim and become a perpetrator. This means the council are now under no obligation to house them as they are seen to be homeless through choice.

I've seen people go from homeless and helpless to being ignored by the council because they've been caught shoplifting in town.

null,false,joethepro36,null,null,null,"Of course the middle and classes benefit from migration economically but the lowest 10% of wage earners actually see their incomes negatively effected. An ever increasing wave of migration keeps the bottom level of wages low forever with big business and wealthy people continuing to trample on the poor. Big business loves migration, an infinite supply of minimum wage (or lower) labour that will work in bad conditions happily. This is why our leaders and business, hand in hand are so in favor of it. For God's sake do any of you really think they like immigration out of some humanitarian urge or moral reasoning?

Its not just economics though. What of British culture? Even with the current trends, British culture in a few areas of the country is being supplanted by migrant culture. The specific culture being imported varies by area as you'd expect but it doesn't matter if the culture is Asian rooted or European, British culture is done away with nonetheless. A minor problem at the moment with the exception of grooming gangs, however those would be ghettos have only more people to add over the next few years. The migration projections are clear enough.

In regards to unlimited migration, if migration is increased substantially beyond current levels, social cohesion will rapidly drop. Communities would suffer from ethnic tension and possibly further religious tension too. Assimilation takes a long time, usually two to three generations of time. This endless wave of migration touted to pay for the pensions of the elderly won't just anger the resident communities but even the very migrants themselves. Migrants assimilated to British culture, who have worked hard over decades and built up wealth suffer in the same way that native Britons do. Indeed you'll find many ethnic minority UKIP candidates are middle aged to elderly, what a coincidence.

500 million in Europe is touch misleading too. What's really meant is the rich western and northern parts of Europe, a far smaller proportion of the number. Still a couple of hundred million yes but the migrants aren't exactly seeking entry to Romania or other former Communist countries.

The real elephant in the room is the tremendously high birth rate within Africa that feeds this migration. People in the west love to talk about how the earth is overpopulated while having a birth rate *below* replacement level. If you want to solve migration properly, help Africa develop. The Chinese have it right, invest in large projects and development to give the people there more opportunities and stop the need for them to come to the west for a better life in the first place.",null,0,null,1435532901,null,0,false,0,cslu3d2,null,t3_3bdx5k,null,t1_cslu3d2,null,t3_3bdx5k,null,null,null,1437423078,null,6,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

[The rumored] £50m is a lot of money. Let me get that out of the way.  But here's my argument why it isn't enough.

What happens if he finally learns to be a prolific scorer? Most goalscorers don't mature til their mid 20s and he's shown great tactically awareness and development.  Imagine if he learns how to finish? I'm clearly a fan of keeping him even if he's unhappy.

Also as The Anfield Wrap recently outlined, £50m isn't financially the same as a straight, normal £50m transfer, when you consider the following if we kept him to his contract for two more seasons:
1- we would be paid a development fee (for being under 24) which could be significant (~£10-15m especially if he continues to stay fit and earn England caps)
2- 20% of the fee goes to QPR (so £50m only nets us £40m)
3 - since he's earning £35k/week, and probably should be closer to £100k/week, we're saving approximately £7m (£65k/week for 2 more seasons)
4 - after the 2 seasons, he still probably leaves but you never know what can happen

So if he stays, we get (#1)/save(#3) at least £15-20m in fee/wages. And if we sell now for £50m, we only keep £40m and lose out on a great young player.  So, it's really only £20-25m of a difference if he leaves, which isn't worth it to me.",null,0,null,1435533647,null,0,false,0,csluh7j,null,t3_3bfx2u,null,t1_csluh7j,null,t1_cslslwd,null,null,null,1437423441,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

null,false,Drugba,MN,mongolia,null,"Just to get this out there, I watched every game last season except for our loss to West Brom, so I saw almost every game Willian played.

Anyway, you're saying you think Willian was one of the best attacking mids in the league last season? You're clearly insane.

I understand that there are a number of intangibles in football that can't be put into stats, but it's almost impossible to argue those, so I'm going to stick with stats for this argument.

You've made it clear in your other comment that you feel Oscar isn't one of the best players in the league, and I assume by your comment back to me that you feel Willian is. By that we can assume that you believe Willian &gt; Oscar. Let's go to the stats...

Starting with basic offensive stats Willian is already at a disadvantage. In the EPL last year Oscar had 6 goals and 8 assists, while Willian only had 2 goals and 3 assists and that's with Willian playing almost 400 minutes more than Oscar in the EPL. While neither of them have ""Best in the league"" numbers, it's pretty clear Oscar was a bigger threat to goal.

But wait you say... a lot of Willian's contributions to the team are defensive! Looking at the defensive stats don't really help Willian's case either. Willian averaged 1 tackle per game, 0.4 interceptions per game, 0.2 clearances per games, while committing 0.8 fouls per game. Oscar averaged 1.9 tackles per game, 0.5 interceptions per game, 1.1 clearances per game, while committing 1.3 fouls per game. Again, not looking so good for Willian. Oscar did commit more fouls that Willian, but it's pretty clear he also contributed a lot more to defense.

If we look at more in depth offensive stats, there is much less of a gap between the two, but still not enough for me to conclusively argue one was better than the other. Willian has a better passing %, but number of key passes per game are very similar (Willian: 1.4, Oscar 1.3). Oscar takes more shots per game and attempts more passes. Willian plays more long balls, and hits more crosses (although that's expected as his position isn't central). Willian probably has the edge in passing stats, but not enough that it makes up for his lack of threat in front of goal.

IMO, I don't think there is that much between the two players talent wise. I just don't get how you can think Oscar is not one of the best players in the league and then turn around and say Willian is, when at best Willian's stats are about equal to Oscar's.",null,0,null,1435533656,null,0,false,0,csluhds,null,t3_3bextc,null,t1_csluhds,null,t1_cslte6d,null,null,null,1437423443,null,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5,null

I believe many learn of the suffering non-white, non-males went through in the past, and feel it necessary for the tables to flip completely, not just balance out.

[This is a lecture from 2013. Why So Many Americans Don't Want Social Justice and Don't Trust Scientists](https://youtu.be/b86dzTFJbkc).

Regarding the Social Justice movement, he talks about how Affirmative Action is employed to support women &amp; minorities *more* than white men, in order to make things more equal. The problem is, nowadays, working class white people are the ones suffering the most.

1. he doesn't press a whole lot, and the style that we play if the striker doesn't press effectively then we don't tend to close down very well. Similar to how Balotelli struggled with this defensive game, although he improved significantly.

2. He isn't very technical, sure he has a strong shot and decent technique. But a lot of his goals with Villa came on counters and not many when he had to beat more than a defender. If he plays for us a lot of the time we will have our opposition sitting in the box so that is a different ball game, this is unknown at this time with Benteke. One thing I'll give him is his passing, and that is very good compared to someone like Balotelli.

3. you already highlighted his lack of pace, and I wouldn't really say he is above average but more like average. But if he is through on goal there isn't catching him so that is good. But how effective is he to latch onto through balls? No idea and haven't seen him do that with Villa or Belgium.

He is in high demand and therefore Soton retain some bargaining power since they know clubs will still have to outbid the others.

They never actually say why. When we first see them, they had been traveling for at least a little time. My headcanon is that he couldn't take the bureaucracy and was bored out of his mind, craving to see the universe first hand.

* He is called the Doctor why? The excuse now is that he meant to help people, but back then he seemed all for himself.

Again, no real reason is given. Though I think he picked it because it's a respected title, plus he had the scientific knowledge to warrant it.

* They both lived in the TARDIS in 1960s London for months. Do we have a reason?

Susan wanted to go to school there. She wasn't a big a fan of the traveling and wanted them them to stay somewhere. I guess it just seemed like a nice place, and she convinced him to let her stay there awhile. Given that he had no control over where the TARDIS went at all, he had to stay there as well.

* He was a fugitive, yes? That's why he was later exiled to Earth?

At the end of the Second Doctor era, he encountered a situation he could not deal with himself and felt it was important enough that he had no choice but to call the Time Lords, thus giving away where he was. When they arrived, they put him on trial. The trial was much more about him interfering with other worlds, than it was about actually stealing the TARDIS. He convinced them that he had been more good than harm, so they let him go, but stranded him on earth. It was sort of like a probation thing, I guess.

* What happened to his granddaughter?

Ah, the first departure in the show. While fighting off a Dalek invasion of Earth, Susan fell in love with a someone. At the end of the serial, they go to leave, everyone else goes into the TARDIS (there were 2 other companions at the time). Susan is saying her goodbyes, but he asks her to stay. She says she wants to, but that she has to go, because her grandfather needs her.

Throwing claims of ""he's not a Rodgers player"" or ""won't fit with the squad"" aside for a moment, Benteke does have a half-decent record of scoring goals in the Premier League. More importantly, he has that over several seasons. 

Carroll had scored 11 goals in half a PL season when he joined us, and his only career stats before then was 17 goals in 39 games in the Championship. We signed him off the back of a few good games at a point in time where we had to find a short-notice replacement for Torres. It wasn't just that Carroll was overhyped, it was that he was overhyped based on a very short period of time. 

I'm wary of us signing Benteke for anything above £20-25m, but at the same time he's definitely a more proven goalscorer most of the other strikers we've signed in the last few years, arguably even more than Sturridge. I don't see him routinely banging in 25 goals a season, but I think he'd definitely make a reliable and solid goals contribution each season and that's more than can be said for a lot of our forwards right now.

null,false,biskino,null,null,null,"That's a really great description of what it means to be a decent person, and the level of decency that we should expect of others.

But I think when people talk about Political Correctness, they aren't talking about being decent, they're complaining about other's expecting them to be decent, and the consequences that occur when they aren't. 

I imagine pretty much everyone can think of situations where someone else complained about something they did or said that felt unjustified or overly sensitive. And rather than engage in self examination, it's a lot easier to chalk it up to 'Political Correctness' and blame the other person for being offended. That may be justified, it may not be justified. My problem with 'Political Correctness' is that it's a single catch-all that allows people to blend really horrible behaviour into relatively innocuous behaviour. 

A waitress objects to your sweet old grandpa calling her 'honey'? Political Correctness!

People complain there aren't enough women on panel shows? Political Correctness!

Can't have pin-up girl posters in the garage at work? Political Correctness!

Can't send a raunchy photo to work colleagues? Political Correctness!

Can't have a client meeting at a strip club? Political Correctness! 

Police can't do racial profiling? Political Correctness!

Can't sing a racist chant at a football match? Political Correctness! 

Can't call the gay guy at school a 'fag'? Political Correctness!

I expect that most people would find some of the things on that list pretty tame, and others totally objectionable.

That's why, to me, the phrase has absolutely no meaning. And when I hear it, I just assume the person doesn't want to actually think about the behaviour that's being called out and would rather just put it in a box with a bunch of other ideas they'd rather go unexamined.

Whilst on the easy BTEC I talked to someone else who had done a different BTEC(but same level) at the same college and she said it was far more intense so the quality of teaching/grading criteria/workload can even vary within the colleges.

I know it's a lot to assume from your title but if you're looking to apply to a course your best bet is to go to an open day or call and visit the college and request a variety of work books(including the grades) from the course you're interested in and assess the work load for yourself.

null,false,zPhix,mccoy,McCoy,null,"To expand on the ""reasons"", there are a couple audios that try to vaguely explain it.

Susan tells the story of how they left in the audio **The Beginning** although she claims she didn't fully understand the circumstances because she was so young at the time.  The Doctor had very controversial views on Gallifrey's non-intervention policy, and this made him enemies with some powerful individuals.  Eventually these people came after him, causing him to flee with his granddaughter and to steal a TARDIS.

There's even a scene in the audio where the Doctor leaves Susan in a TARDIS before coming back in and bringing her to a different TARDIS, linking the story with the events shown in *The Name of the Doctor*.

The Doctor's and Susan's first trip in the TARDIS leads them to planet called *The Earth*, but neither of them know anything about it (Susan knows about it's Sun).  They land on The Earth's moon far in the past and a series of events causes them to be flung into far into the future.  In the future they are given a video to watch on Earth's history as a ""First Contact"" procedure which is when The Doctor becomes fascinated with the planet and makes an effort to save it from the danger it was currently facing.

From here the audio ends and they start travelling throughout the Earth, the universe, and other universes.  This went on for awhile before they decided they needed to settle down for Susan's sake, so they make their trip to London in 1963 where Susan becomes a student at Coal Hill School.

There's another audio which recounts the events, though most of it takes place on an alternative Gallifrey.  The audio **Disassembled** has Romana, Leela, Narvin and Braxiatel (The Doctor's Brother) from the primary universe trying to find an alternative Gallifrey that they can use as a home, since their Gallifrey was currently under desparate conditions.

They land on this alternative world and run into an alternative Doctor who hold's the title of ""Lord Burner"", a position which took orders from the Lord President to erase trouble makers and meddlers from history.  In both the primary and alternative timeline Braxiatel was in this position around the time of the First Doctor and Susan.  He was ordered by Lord President Pandad VII to burn ""an old man"" and ""his granddaughter"" from history.  In the alternative timeline Braxiatel ended up getting killed by The Doctor who inherited his position, but in the primary timeline Braxiatel disobeyed the order and let them get away.  It is hinted that Braxiatel may have been responsible for the Lord President's death that day, which may have prevented the Time Lords from pursuing The Doctor.",null,0,null,1435538451,null,0,false,0,cslwrxw,null,t3_3bfz6d,null,t1_cslwrxw,null,t3_3bfz6d,null,null,null,1437424897,null,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6,null

Arda is almost the perfect example of buying a top player in his prime, and willing to give atleast a couple of seasons of his best quality.

null,false,zPhix,mccoy,McCoy,null,"As for what happened to Susan, after the events **The Dalek Invasion of Earth** where she falls in love and the Doctor lets her go, she meets up with the Doctor at least three times.  

The first is in **The Five Doctors** when she is timescooped to the deathzone on Gallifrey along with other companions and incarnations of the Doctor.  In this story she spends most of her time with the First Doctor but also gets to interact with his Fifth incarnation.  At the end of the story everyone is brought back to where they were taken from.

The next two meetings may contradict each other, but some Who fans have the tendency to creatively put things together.  Oddly enough both of these instances are in The Doctor's Eighth incarnation.  The first of which is in the novel *Legacy of the Daleks*, and the second instance in the audio *An Earthly Child* and subsequently in the Eighth Doctor Adventures audios.

**Novel Eighth Doctor Adventures (Legacy of the Daleks):** I'll start by saying I haven't read this novel, but the TARDIS wiki points some things out which may contradict the audio meeting.  In the novel Susan and her husband are said to be unable to have children so they've adopted.  By the end of the novel her husband is killed by The Master.  Now by the next Susan/Doctor meeting on audio, she says she hasn't seen him since his Fifth incarnation.  I usually explain away Eighth Doctor novel/audio inconsistencies by using the potential reset at the end of *The Gallifrey Chronicles* novel to reset Time Lord actions and memories relating to the ""The Enemy"" and the ""Second War in Heaven"" that caused Gallifrey's first destruction in the novel *The Ancestor Cell*.  However, I'm unsure if this could be stretched to cover Susan's situation.

**Audio Eighth Doctor Adventures (An Earthly Child)**:

In this audio we learn that Susan has a son called Alex, but that her husband passed away years ago (yay consistency, sort of), Susan is in a government-related position and is dealing with a new trade-relations with aliens for the first time in since the Dalek invasion.  The Doctor arrives and tries to learn more about his new great grandson, leaving a not too great impression on him.  He eventually meets up with Susan where they excitedly talk about various Time Lord and family things.  By the end of the audio he couldn't convince Alex to come with him, but promises to visit more often.

 I've heard a convincing argument by Marxists that since the 1960's culture has indeed been recognised as a form of output in terms of capital and culture nowadays is even harder to pin down much less implement into some sort of control by the masses.

I don't think they are gaining, I think they *have gained* legitimacy. At least as far as outside perception goes.

&gt;they tend to be about raising awareness about rape culture, or ending sex trafficking or fighting against the erasure of older women in the media.

These are pretty noble causes, but the problem is as I describe, they are not as prominent. Feminism's mainstream image is being drastically tarnished by the big, loud, numerous, bad eggs.

Also, I'm not fully convinced of concepts like patriarchy and rape culture. Partially because they incriminate me, but also because I think they are blowing a small problem into a big issue. And by that I don't mean that rape is a small problem, I just think that only a small amount of men commit it. I think that the people you want to discourage from raping, won't really listen to you anyway, since they are heartless morons/psychopaths.

And when you get small issues blown out of proportion like that, damage is done. Censorship and restriction of speech happens. *This word* can't be said, *that shirt* can't be worn, it's insane. So people push back.

I actually watch him play. So do the thousands of others that will tell you that exact same thing.

&gt; Saying he may not replacing anyone implies 

I am not Jose, I am not here to formulate the tactical setup for next season. There is a difference between saying he won't be replacing anyone, to not knowing who he will replace and where he will play.

&gt;  I know you will say that you watch all of the games and that's dandy but if he is so excellent he would have more than 4 assists

No, this means almost nothing. As shown by Iniesta, you can have tremendous impact and creativity in a team, without having to constantly produce the last pass before a goal. This is what Turan has been doing at Atleltico, and why is their number 10 and guaranteed starter.


&gt; And your argument about Koke and Turan not having the same role, they play in the same system

Okay? Matic and Fabregas also play in the same system, does that mean they are directly comparable? 

If you want a semi-in depth analysis by the person here who actually watches them regularly, here you go.

Koke starts on paper on the left, but unlike Turan, he *does not* stretch the field often and play much more centrally. He also is in much more closer connection with Greizmann, who as a a sort of second forward played more on the left side of the pitch in connection with Koke, than the right side. Turan, plays on the right and as I said plays wider than Koke. He is also much more isolated because of Greizmann drifting left, and the fact that he is closer to the sidelines than Koke. When you play where Turan plays, it is very unlikely your passes will be the direct results of goals, which has exactly been the case. His passes however do catalyze important plays for Atleitco, and they have benefited immensely from his creative presence.

Comparing these two players directly with each other is useless, especially with statistics.

**Catch 22 - Joseph Heller** *9/10*

That was a stunner of a book. The humour is brilliant, my favourite bit was 

&gt;""They're trying to kill me,"" Yossarian told him calmly.
&gt;
""No one's trying to kill you,"" Clevinger cried.
&gt;
&gt;""Then why are they shooting at me?"" Yossarian asked.

&gt;""They're shooting at everyone,"" Clevinger answered. ""They're trying to kill everyone.""
&gt;
&gt;""And what difference does that make?""



**Stone Junction - Jim Dodge** *6/10*

To be honest 3/4's of this book had the potential to be one of the best I'd ever read but the end was ... weird. Without giving too much away it's about a kid who grows up being trained by a collection of ""Alchemists, Magicians and Outlaws"" and then that all culminates in a quest of sorts that combines all of the skills he learned along the way. Worth Reading, just be prepared for a weird ending.

**The Day Of The Triffids - John Wyndham** *9/10*

I read this one years and years ago but after talking to someone about it, it became clear I had either missed or forgotten some fairly important plot points so I decided to read it again as it's only short. Really glad I did, finished it off in under a day and enjoyed every minute of it.

**1984 - George Orwell** *undecided*

Only read 10 pages so far so I can't tell you what I think of it but I'm enjoying it as I go. I've picked this up to read a few times in the past and alway been distracted or too busy to give it the time it deserves. Hopefully this time I will be able to finish it.

**Burmese Days - George Orwell** *Up next*

I stole this one from the hostel I was living in after deciding it was too good for the anti-intellectual pricks that lived there. From what I understand this is a fictional reimagining of Orwells life experience when he was a policeman in Burma. Looking forward to it, I'm certain it will provide a great insight into the colonial world.

**A Short History Of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson** *Coming Soon*

LHR is fucked because it's in an area that is densely populated by people wealthy enough to afford lawyers and run around with signs, which politicians hate and permissions get slowed down by. This is a major issue because the airport already is severely slot-restricted, meaning no more flights can be added once the slots are filled (and they are). It's already basically an A380 museum, so little more people can go on a plane since there simply aren't many larger types. This will drive up ticket prices, which are already heavily taxed in the UK, even more. It's a very tricky situation.
