Well first of all, everything's free, and it's a whole range of entertainment formats, from gigs to cinema to talks to tours to games - in all kinds of locations you might never have set foot in before, both inside and outside. Businesses put on arts or education events in their premises - barbershop quartets in a barbershop, for example, or historic tours of the Belfast Tele offices. 

Some events are free versions of things that happen at other times of the year - one of the most popular is the Pigeon and Plum vaudeville show, which has queues down the road - it's a ""go early"" one if you're interested! I had a cabaret on the steps of the Ulster Hall, with street dance in the alcove beside it, in 2012; mini, street-level version of the Sofa Sessions I'd been running upstairs. Pop-up cinema shows are common too.

 Some sports organisations put on tasters - roller derby, BMX/skating etc; lots of the arts events are hands-on, have-a-go-yourself type things. 

Some of the events are ""social message"" events done in brilliantly creative ways - I loved the New Orleans street funeral ""Death of Democracy"" a couple of years ago.

There tends to be a big performance - orchestra/choir etc - in the Cathedral Q just before the finale. Finale the last couple of years has been the Beat Carnival's main yearly carnival parade, which has had 100s of drummers &amp;amp; 100s of dancers perform an international dance/music show (it started as a N Ireland/France/Portugal/S Africa project), with guitar orchestra/brass band/other musicians. I missed last year but was working for them year before; was class ([watch videos of last year and year before here](http://beatcarnival.com/videos)).

&gt;Context, consideration, balance? 

Take those, and see what you win every year. Context is OK to an extent, but every time something against the manager comes up, this PR machine starts bellowing smoke, such is the over-drive.

&gt;But then the names many want in the dug out might not be sold on Liverpool’s position in the food chain or the club’s philosophies behind the scenes.

And the writer knows this beacause? Have we tried anyone yet? Stupid fucking assumption to make before even giving a it a fair go. 
I think he's just putting this out because he's trying to drive the point home that currently we cant do any better than Rodgers.and we must keep him. 

&gt;Or does the club just make change for the sake of change? 

Moronic statement. 3 years and nothing is still 'change for the sake of change' situation? Yeah Ok. 

And whatever remains, is summed up well in the first comment there:

&gt;A rather spirited defence of Rodgers which ignores the obvious, what happens on the pitch. Rodgers himself set out his ever reducing goals for the season based on lavish spending on players he “has the last word on”. Yes 60 odd points might compare reasonably with recent history, but why employ a manger for the most marginal of gains?The performances have been lamentable, even during that 13 game ‘run’. 

&gt;The collective head scratching at bizarre tactics, line ups and substitutions by those of us sitting watching it were painful. While his odd press conferences and verbal inadequacies are irrelevant and should play no part in assessing or defending his performance, his abject displays in Europe during his tenure should.


&gt;Three years and counting, £215m and much more demanded. When do we say this has been a failed experiment and look for a better manager? Would you accept a player who has been so decidedly average being kept on because he had one good season? Probably not. I have no faith in Rodgers. 

&gt;As I’ve posted before it left me during the debacle that was St James’ park this season. If FSG keep him then fine, they own the club, but what guarantee that the players he brings in will be a step up on those he has already recruited and mostly discarded? Will his tactical acumen blossom over the summer? Will his backroom staff suddenly acquire the experience, knowledge and stature of the ‘boot room’. Hope so, but what happens if it’s Christmas, he has had his annual poor start and his verbal gymnastics continue?

Nothing new in the post, just another one for the 'keep Rodgers' garbage bin.

If we want to consistently challenge for top 4 and do well in the Champions League, it would only be a realistic goal if we can be consistent in the lesser difficult Europa League while maintaining league form. Consistency is something we have lacked, and only when we are able to maintain performances will we be able to maintain top 4 for more than one season at a time. 

Most of our young players don't have much / any experience in European leagues. So qualifying for the Champions League and having big expectations is pointless. Not only that, but winning the Europa League is not easy at all. Look at the clubs remaining in this years Europa League, they are all probably better than us. If we want any chance of winning the Europa League we'd definitely need a few signings (strikers obviously) and a bit of luck along the way (as you need with any tournament).

He hasn't done nearly enough to warrant what his demands are. He isn't good enough to start for any Champions League side above us. He has the pace and technical ability but his end product is still quite a ways off the level it needs to be. His finishing is absolutely dire and if it doesn't improve it will be what keeps him from becoming a truly great player. 

I think that if a club like City come in this summer and offer a ridiculous amount for him I would accept it in a heartbeat because I think his mercenary attitude is a bad influence in the other players at the club.

edit- I apolgise for my above comment, what I meant to say is that the article is from 2009 so it is a little stale and out of date. if you want to discuss police agent provocateurs/undercover police operations/surveilance/harrassment of activists please do but lets keep the articles up to date. 

Yes, at the G20 there were police swanning in and out of the kettles, they were easy to spot as as they dressed way too neat and hidy and looked like a 40 year  old dad at a rock festival (with massive rugby shoulders). if you are used to activism you become used to how police/assocated people act, however there are plenty of /r/conspiracy types who see a ""plainclothes"" police officer at a demo, and assume its a deep secret they have discovered, during the March 26th 2011 anticuts protest the blackbloc was going down oxford street, the police had formed a line on one side of the pavement to keep the protesters away from Topshop and some one caught on camera a ""undercover agent provocateur"" slipping through the police lines after flashing an ID card, ""Oh shock horror!"" it was just a casually dressed person, more likely it was either a plainclothes police officer on his local beat, or a plainsclothes security staff hired by Topshop (they proberly hired a few extra security that day), also by ""security staff"" that could include specialists who collect photo data (similar to private investigators for protecting their shops), anyway my point was that the ""protest movement"" seems to get wrapped up in this issue of ""evil police provateurs"", and its this repeatitive game, and as a rowdy anarchist I find it a little tiring.

 I would rather focus on building an effective movement, for example after last saturdays protest, who needs evil provocateurs when you have 16 years olds writing shit on war memorials?  I have a friend who was arrested/cautioned at one of the student demos, his arrest video again was shared all over the internet and conspiracy types commented heavily on it. Basically he was standing around minding his own business when a snatch squad of plainsclothes burly police rugby types jumped him and dragged him behind the policelines, a big kurfuffle of protester types all shouting ""shame on you!"" errupted, but bascially it appeared the police had grabbed a random leftie to make a scene, as quickly a line of black clad youths were infront of mass of flouressent police goading etc. After a few weeks I caught up with my ""friend"" what did you get arrested for?

Over the last 10 years I have seen a couple of sheep  and a cow carcasses while out walking the dogs on the open moor.  I grew up and spend most of my adult life in Africa and although not a naturalist by any means, I know what a single large predator kill looks like up close. They did not die of natural causes and were not eaten by dogs (big scratch marks, no scatter and rip on the kill ect) However, I never found any spoor or scat in the area so nothing conclusive.

The local farmers regularly talk of live stock being lost / eaten but these are always reported to DEFRA and the insurance as dog worrying because witch craft / aliens / big cats will result in no or very slow pay-outs.  The best story I have heard first hand was from an RAF pilot who failed an escape and evasion exercise because something got into the bush he was hiding in during the night and he decided to leg it because it made growling noses at him.  What ever it was, it scared the hell out of him.

There is also a good story, parts of which I know to be true, about how the moor got stocked with big cats years.  When the UK law on dangerous animals got changed, a local(ish) bloke who had a small private zoo got caught for drunk driving coming back from the moor late at night.  A few days later he killed himself, apparently leaving no records of where his menagerie ended up.  The rumor is that he had been dumping his ""pets"" on the moor nr Camelford at night.

Nothing has ever been proved, only a few dodgy pictures of house cats have been taken.  My take is the likelihood very much a maybe, but having seen a couple of kills myself - it is more than possible.  The moor is very empty apart from the farmers, so who knows what's skulking around in the mist.

I live in a constituency which until 2010 was Labour with a very narrow majority. The sitting MP was not widely admired and she was heavily implicated in the expenses scandal, and she lost her seat in 2010 to a Conservative with a slender majority.

That new Tory MP had been very good as a constituency MP, working hard to resolve issues and bring up local problems with the relevant ministers, and generally being exactly what you'd want your MP to be.

The race this time was between him again, and the old Labour MP who was trying to win her seat back. Despite having no love at all for the old Labour MP, I had even less love for the prospect of a Conservative government, so I voted Labour. And Labour won in our constituency, again by a narrow margin.

One of the main benefits for many will be a referendum on the EU. Arguably it should settle the issue which will be a good thing and it might actually prompt reform in the EU because (for all the rhetoric) they will try to keep us in rather than out.   
  
If you are socially conservative then congatulations the 1922 committee will have your back. A slender majority probably means some iffy social decisions will be made (because that should help placate the back benchers). Fox hunting is the prime example: most Tory MPs represent countryside constituencies so for many of them this is a serious issue. They are representing their constituents properly I guess (even if many people won't like it).  
  
The economy is a contentious one. Some would argue that on balance we are better with the Tories. This is sort of hard to tell because it was never really clear how Labour would have gone about their reforms which, whilst they would have been popular, might have actually had adverse effects. In many ways the Tories staying will probably encourage the large financial institutions to keep their HQs here (which is unpopular but better to have them paying 750m in tax [HSBC] than not).  
  
Tax will probably remain static and might even go down a little which is always nice and the general preference of the markets for Tory governments probably means that we'll see slightly lower inflation.

The problem with this is that working is available to (nearly) everyone where as investing is only available to those with something to invest already.

See [here on our website](http://www.scottoiler.com/uk/products/scottoiler-fs-365.html) or search the web for unsolicited advice. 

FS365 is made for people commuting and using their bike frequently in winter. Its not a long-term storage solution but something that is made with people in mind that ride all year round. 

Basically all you do when you come home is you spray your entire bike with it, its ok to use on chrome and plastics as well (obviously avoid the brake discs) and you can even spray it on the dirt. When you come to the weekend and you actually have time to wash your bike it will make cleaning your bike a lot easier. 

Basically ACF50 creates a barrier to the environment and the salt. The problem is you dont know when this barrier will wear off and you have to be careful not to trap any salt between your bike and the barrier... so make sure your bike is super clean before applying it. 

FS365 works by neutralising the ph-level of the salt, basically disrupting the chemical process involved in corrosion. 

For long term storage I would recommend ACF50 but if you ride your bike in the winter then definitely give FS365 a go!",null,0,null,1431419604,null,0,false,0,cr6e2u5,null,t3_35nk9v,null,t1_cr6e2u5,null,t3_35nk9v,null,null,null,1432910301,null,5,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,5,null

The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the [Vajrayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana) [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) traditions as [charnel grounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnel_ground). Comparable practices are part of Zoroastrian burial practices where deceased are exposed to the elements and birds of prey on stone structures called [Dakhma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakhma).  Few such places remain operational today due to religious marginalisation, urbanisation and the decimation of vulture populations.

null,false,cbfw86,,Visions for society on stone tablets and Secularism don't mix,null,"My take is this.

The government borrows money by selling IOUs to rich people. We often read about government bonds (sometimes called gilts, to give them their official, neo-draconic names) and the rates on them. Typically, a person will buy a government bond (let's pick an easy number; £1,000) and be promised payout in 10 years time, say. The rate is 2%. So in 10 years time, Ms Investor gets her £1,000 back, plus 2%, being £20. Think of it as a financial equivalent of putting your money into cryogenetic sleep.

At the moment Germany is tearing it apart. At one point the rates on their government bonds were lower than interest in savings accounts, so in effect they could borrow money (by selling bonds), stick it in the bank, let the borrowed money mature for 10 years, then pay back the borrowed money and the interest owed on it to the lender, and pocket the interest. (It was effectively as close as you can get to printing money without resorting to literally printing more money.) I doubt they actually did that, but the possibility was there because of the figures.

On the far other end of the spectrum, you had (have) Greece. Greece are fucked. Like - totally fucked. For another generation at least. Their rates got so high (because of the explicit risk that investors may never get their money back) that it made borrowing excruciatingly difficult for them. They could easily sell as many gilts as they (read: Germany) would allow, but then in 10 years time they'd have to cough up billions in pay-outs plus hundreds of millions in interest to the lenders.

The problem I have with borrowing is two fold.

First of all, it's basically a Ponzi scheme. I think there were some headlines during the 2010-15 term where it was claimed that the government had borrowed money to pay off the debt. Essentially, they'd sold more gilts/borrowed more money to pay off people who'd borrowed money years ago. That's unsustainable, and it's a warning sign that in three of four years' time, we're going to have to cough up A LOT to make the payments on the £billions borrowed in the wake of the crash. And if we can't afford to pay it off, we're only going to have to borrow more to make those payments, and the cycle risks repeating.

Secondly, you have to understand who's 'lending' the government money. It's the rich. Not the aspirational middle classes who want to hit £60k. We're talking the mega rich. Tycoons and Old Money^TM . It's a safe investment and the smartest place to sink a few million if you've got that sloshing around. You're not going to use that money, you'll never manage to spend it, and the government is a safer establishment than a bank which, as Lehman Brothers showed, might go tits up and you lose all your money. Bank accounts are only guaranteed up to around £50k, and if you've got millions sitting around then you'll want a safer investment. The government is that investment, even if it's a lower rate of interest (because there's less risk).

So the rich are investing all this money, and we're all benefiting from it directly. Not some trickle down economics where their floods of business investments trickle out a few drops for me in my wages, but direct investment. Someone, or some entity like a hedge fund, might sink £10million into gilts, and that goes straight into Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, or the University of Manchester. And that's good, right?

Not really. Not when we can be paying our own way. The issue is that the borrowing route means rich people get much much richer as the years roll on. Just made £200,000 on your investment? Cool. Now do I buy a boat or buy more gilts? ... MORE GILTS! It's a farce. Government borrowing makes the filthy rich filthier still, exacerbating the wealth gap. It doesn't solve anything. Borrowing just kicks the can down the road and makes rich people richer, while leaving the poor and the middle class to hate each other. The people making money off borrowing are the banks and the hedge funds and the tycoons who have money than the town of sunny Brighton.

I agree that a small amount of borrowing isn't a bad thing. It's a relatively cheap way of raising money to shore up the difference when used in small amounts. It can keep taxes down for the poorest and make everyone a bit happier. But the idea of continuing to borrow when we currently owe inordinately rich bastards £1.5 trillion is nothing short of fiscal irresponsibility. The deficit has to be cut and maintained at a low level, and we have to pay off our own debts without borrowing more money. And as an aside I'm totally in favour of taxing the rich more in order to do that.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"&gt;What does this 0% mean?

It means you pay no interest on qualifying transactions.  In this case ""qualifying transactions"" would include purchases and balance transfers.

&gt;Can I 'buy' the max credit in to a savings account, get interest, then pay the same value back?

You can't ""buy"" it - paying money into a bank account is never a purchase but some credit card providers will class it as a balance transfer.  I don't know if Santander do, but *if* they do then in principle yes, you could transfer all the money into a savings account for the duration of the interest fee period then pay it back and keep the interest (you would still have to make a minimum payment every month, but this would come straight off the balance and not include any interest).

In the early 2000's when the card companies were falling over themselves to lend and interest rates were higher this was a fairly common thing - it was often referred to as ""[stoozing](http://www.stoozing.com/)"" after a poster on The Motley Fool UK message board.  Tales of high 5 figure sums stashed away in savings accounts (or offsetting mortgages) were not uncommon.

The one thing to watch out for is balance transfer fees.  Many 0% balance transfer offers charge no interest but do charge a percentage of the balance as a one off fee - around 3% is typical.  With low interest rates the fee will often wipe out the profit from stoozing (although from a quick look it would appear Santander don't have a fee).",null,0,null,1431420693,null,0,1431442499,0,cr6ebal,null,t3_35l6vp,null,t1_cr6ebal,null,t1_cr6diok,null,null,null,1432910412,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Rodgers needs to identify earlier whether his system for the season is working. As fans we need to assume that adjustments will be required and that our formation will change throughout the year.

Three at the back is a viable alternative and it works.

If you don't earn much then the rise of the minimum wage to £8 is probably a good thing.

If you earn more then lifting the 40% threshold to £50k might be a good thing (though it possibly depends on your pension contributions). They say they're not increasing NI, but I don't know if that means just the rates or the thresholds too.

Raising the personal allowance should benefit most people, and it looks like it'll be locked to at least the minimum wage (30h/week @ minimum wage =&gt; no income tax)

Rail fare increases are limited to inflation (probably just the regulated ones, but that'll be big for people who get season tickets/etc).

An interesting transparency thing: 

&gt; Requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap - the difference between average pay for male and female employees

The EU makes legal repercussions for breaking ECHR rules. Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan are also a part of the ECHR but very little comes of their human rights violations.

Also I think the tories are more divided on this issue than they let on (especially after an election, easy to be United in victory) while Cameron may be happy with the EU he also wishes to reform, in ways no other EU country wishes to. He'll fail to reform it because of this or from how ill defined his reform ideas are. Then he may switch support. I am interested to see how it plays out closer to the election.

Asda is one of the cheaper supermarkets (a little more expensive than Aldi and Lidl). Sainsburys is more mid range so is usually a fair bit more expensive than Asda.

The big difference I find (and this may vary between different regions) between Aldi &amp; Lidl Vs Sainsburys &amp; Asda is that Aldi and Lidl don't bother reducing stock that is going out of date as it is often cheaper for them to just throw it out.

Asda, Sainsburys and to different extents the other big supermarkets will generally reduce things at about midday on the day they have to be sold. Then a few hours before the stores close they will reduce things further. Typically they would knock about 1/3rd off the price of items in the first round of reductions. Then at the end of the day they will reduce things right down to about 1/4 of the original price.

The key is learning what time your local shops typically start reducing things.

They suggest cutting the structural deficit, which is the day to day borrowing we have to do to cover welfare, the NHS and our essential programs, but borrowing to invest in our country. This means borrowing money,which is currently at record low interest rates, to invest in railways, schools, Univerisities etc which all add back to the economy. I believe it's 1 pound into infrastructure generates 3 for The economy but I'm not sure.

Another thing the liberals believe in is the free market, and economic liberalism. Letting companies decide where to spend their money and letting them compete. Competition is key to living standards in my eyes, it means that Morrisons has to put on offers or Microsoft have to be making new and better games rather than sitting on their laurels. 

However, the Liberals understand that companies can also harm living standards and people in the quest for increased profits which is why they do advocate certain standards, like the minimum wage and other consumer protection.

The flipside that old Labour, and perhaps the Greens, would argue is that the best way to protect consumers is to have the Government own industry and control pay, working hours etc directly rather than through legislation. This could be more effective because the Government doesn't have to worry about profits as much, although it certainly does a little if it doesn't want to borrow billions.

I believe the conservatives advocate no borrowing, and instead letting companies rule themselves with minimal interference from the state, however they don't have any plans to get rid of the minimum wage! The upside of this is that private companies can be more efficient than Governments and so they bring more money to the economy.

No not at all. Self evidently I would have thought. 

I'm not even saying that the net moral outcome of what the Empire forces did, in a utilitarian sense, was worse, at least in a small handful of cases.

My point is that we have no businesses glorifying the Empire, or taking any kind of moral high ground. We committed atrocities of unimaginable savagery. There is room for a sober factual reflection about whether or not one atrocity prevented others (the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima for example) but nowhere should it be possible to feel *pride*. You can't feel *proud* about disintegrating civilians with nuclear weapons, and you can't feel proud of what we did in Kenya. It wasn't a humanitarian mission.

One of the main selling points of UC was that it was supposed to remove a huge chunk of complexity from the current system though.  Taking a wide view, it was supposed to roll half a dozen different benefits paid either weekly,  bi-weekly or monthly into one single monthly payments.  That should have been a reasonably straightforward thing to calculate if x is entitled to x and y then pay z) but because it missed out certain benefits like Carers Allowance and Contribution based JSA and ESA which affect the amount of UC paid and since some payments are variable based on income (Housing benefit, Income base JSA) it's been made more complex.

Edit:  I'm not against UC or at least the principles behind it of a simplification and streamlining of the benefits system.  Unfortunately it's been subject to the usual moving of goalposts, undercosting, cheapest bidder sub-contracting and IT failures.

Isn't that pretty much what the UK did from 2008-2012 or so? BofE rates were .50 while inflation was about 3% a year. 

&gt; It really wouldnt take that much, even a small increase in interest rates as a consequence of inflation is likely to lead to a lot of problems with consumer debt which could well see yet another banking crisis. Many homeowners are geared too high.

Well yeah, I think you have to be careful about that, but this current period of economic history is challenging a lot of orthodoxies. Governments have run up huge budget deficits (pretty much whether they tried austerity or not) yet interest rates haven't budged an inch. That is obviously due to the government's entanglement with central banks, but I'm not sure there has been a huge negative consequences to this. Maybe towards consumer debt, since the current paradigm punishes savers so they move their money around the economy. 

I wonder if the US, after a few more quarters of positive growth, are going to kick around raising interest rates to try and deleverage consumers.

That's not for us to judge. If someone from India wants to say that, on balance, they think that British colonial rule was a net benefit, that's for them to decide.  But I can take no pride whatsoever in it.

Farage was considered a fascist by his peers in school and university, and by several accounts used to talk openly about ""getting the nig-nogs out of the country"".

1/3rd of people in the UK will admit to being racist, and the dog whistle politics of UKIP is aimed precisely at tapping into this huge disaffected portion of the electorate. There's a reason that UKIP support increased when the main parties accused them of racism outright.

Remember that UKIP started out as a purely anti EU party that has only become so incredibly popular under the leadership of the man who made anti-immigration the central plank of their policies and rhetoric. All his 'oh, you just don't *get it* do you?' and 'we all know the reasons you wouldn't want a Romanian next door' talk is perfectly aimed dog whistle stuff.

For more evidence of UKIP's racism you need to look no further than the flat-out denial of facts, figures and data around the economic benefits of EU and other migration.

Now before i go any further please let me clarify that i am in no way 'anti religion', i'm a huge supporter of people's unwavering right to believe and practice whatever they want as long as it does not impose upon the way others wish to live their lives. 

However one of the major reasons i have always been a supporter of the Lib Dems is their continued pursuit of evidence based policy and politics. Now this is where i would be most grateful to someone with more knowledge on Mr Farron's history as a politician than i do to possibly answer a few questions or point me to some information where i could read about it myself, but have his beliefs ever affected the manor in which he has publicly conducted himself as an MP or his voting record? 

As i say i have absolutely no issue with him being religious, however i would be concerned if his personal religious opinions on matters had crossed over to his political work as this would be counter to one of the major reasons i have always supported the lib dems as i mentioned before.

The bonus is more austerity. That means lower taxes, smaller government and less public spending. Much of that seems good to many people.

There's a truism that austerity is bad during downturns and a good thing to do when the economy booms - at the moment we're not really in a recession nor are we booming so I guess it's ok to do.

Next certain groups have been singled out to benefit. Pensioners, rich people and children of rich people. For instance they're planning to remove inheritance tax on properties worth up to £1million. That's nice if you're one of the people benefiting from that.

Also, a continued freeze on fuel duty (even though I'd rather they cut it considering 70% of the fuel price is already pure tax).

The good experience: place we're in now was sold by a good, small, local firm. I think it's significant that they're a relatively new outfit, I think only a couple of them, really seemed to care. Photos were good; write up was extensive and thorough, phone calls were answered courteously. 

Tip: if you're buying anywhere with land - smallholdings, farms etc - measure the area yourself. You can do it using google maps if you don't have GIS software. I have never, once, found an Estate Agent's statement regarding the size of a garden or field to be accurate. Read the small print, there's a clause in there saying it's an estimate and has not been measured. For some weird reason it is *always* an over-estimate. Not unusual to be out by a third. 

I've had many dealings (in the same part of the country) with the established firms in the big towns. With maybe two exceptions, sanctimonious tossers to a man. I've had an eighteen year old in a cheap Burtons suit giving me *absolute* fucking twaddle on how easy a renovation would be and what the council would and wouldn't allow... I've had the boss of the firm turn up in his new BMW and suede loafers, tiptoeing around the potholes and dogshit, standing next to a wall reeking of fresh paint, denying that it's been recently painted...

I had three valuations on the last place I sold, which varied so wildly I could only reasonably conclude that either two of them knew fuck all, or three of them did. (Or else the process of valuations is essentially arbitrary, in which case they either don't know it and are idiots, or do know it and are charlatans)

People can call them refugees, asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, or boat people. I see the term ""boat people"" as specific to people who risk their lives by coming over in a very dangerous manner.

Since ""plane people"" aren't dropping out of the sky, being overloaded in to a plane, or crashing planes anywhere, they don't need a special description. 

EDIT: My parents arrived in Australia by boat. They came out on a ship from Europe after WWII. They don't get called Boat People because that's not the sort of *boat* that people are referring to. Boat People are people who *risk their lives* by coming over in a boat covertly. It's a very specific term.

There’s a lot of practical working-through and thinking that needs to be done.”

EDIT: ""The first run told of a young boy called Bernard who was always late, until a postman gave him a ""magic watch"" which could stop time. He soon found out that the postman had magical powers, and that these watches were given to people who needed them. The rules of him keeping his watch were that he must not use it to commit crimes or hurt anyone. Every episode focused on Bernard or someone to whom he'd lent the watch facing a problem or simply doing day-to-day stuff and trying to sort it out, using the watch.


The second run was significantly different. According to the final opening sequence, the watch simply flew through Bernard's window. The character of the ""postman"" did not exist, and Bernard seemed to be the only person in the world who had such a watch. His best friend Nathan knew about the watch. This series revolved mainly around Bernard's school, Pentup Primary, where he'd usually get the better of his bullying schoolteacher called Ms Savage and a popular girl called Nicolette.""",null,0,null,1431430016,null,0,1431452993,0,cr6gfiz,null,t3_35oujn,null,t1_cr6gfiz,null,t1_cr6etnh,null,null,null,1432911479,null,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28,null

And then when they got back their client ended up getting 3 month's worth of paperwork to complete in a week.  
  
Our solicitors rang us up every day for 3 weeks to see if we still wanted to exchange (I presume this is some kind of legal requirement that they needed to fulfil, but it quickly becomes tiresome), and gave us no information about any of the two things above despite the fact that they work literally 4 doors away from both other firms of solicitors.   
  
Our EA were OK to deal with on a personal level, except for the fact that they lost our keys and it was only after an ""audit"" that they found them again. Their keys all live in one safe in one office.  
  
We rejected one EA on the basis that we had a stand-up row with them over some minor detail (it was so minor I can't for the life of me even remember what it was). I remember thinking ""Christ - if this is how you treat your paying customers God help anyone who you don't stand to make a profit from"".  
  
The EA for the people we bought our house off were a positive pain in the arse, with idiotic pronouncements like ""ooh, you'll not get a house for X amount in area Y"" (we got a house for less than X in area Y), and general bloody-mindedness that wouldn't have been in good company on the Jobsworth award section of That's Life.  
  
We ended up signing contracts at 4pm the day before we were due to move. Christ knows what everyone else did, but I'd jumped the gun &amp; already booked a removals firm despite us not having a contract because otherwise we'd have ended up trying to move a load of furniture ourselves using two cars.",null,0,null,1431430180,null,0,false,0,cr6gh8q,null,t3_35ovht,null,t1_cr6gh8q,null,t1_cr6egnh,null,null,null,1432911501,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

You can't expect the striker to be scoring every game to carry the team, that's just unrealistic, especially for a club like us. 

But Rodgers has said it before, Coutinho isn't really a traditional CAM in that he doesn't really have the natural goal threat and he plays a bit deeper (don't see him making runs into the box like Silva/Gerrard of old/Lampard of old/Oscar etc do) and it seems the plan is to play him more like a CM in the future where he can have full control over the game.

As someone who did well in their MEng for mechanical, ill give some advice. The big corporations are very competitive when it comes to graduate schemes. Id recommend applying for internships before you graduate and for the full time grad positions at least a year in advance since most of them start immediately after graduating in the summer. 

Try and do your dissertation in the field you want to go into, it will give you a good knowledge base. 

Make sure you work on your communication skills, writing and talking to people. The majority of engineering students had some incredibly poor writing. You wouldnt believe how many reports, essays and dissertations are poorly written. Just endless streams of consciousness and drivel. Being able to actually communicate your ideas will get you good marks, especially when the standard is horrendously low in engineering.

Firstly, the SNP *only want to appeal to voters north of the border*. This might sound like a negative to progressive English voters but it means that there will be no counter-productive influence within the party, such as we've seen in the past with Labour and the LibDems, to appeal to right-wing voters in the rest of the UK. 

Secondly, unlike every other defeated party in the Commons at the moment who will disappear into soul-searching for a while now, the SNP are very conscious of winning votes at next year's Holyrood elections. Appearing ""more left-progressive Labour"" worked for them in the general election and they need to keep on at this to prevent some kind of return by Labour in Scotland. *Next year.* And unlike every other party we've been used to, appearing somewhat disruptive might work in their favour.

Thirdly unlike other parties in the Commons they are buoyant with victory and confidence at the moment, under a formidable new leader and stuffed full of new, unknown and maybe strange MPs. Possible maverick alert.

None of this might mean that they can make the kind of difference they want to make of course. But it's worth keeping in mind that this isn't quite like 56 new Labour or LibDem MPs.

Given that, there is simply no way that ""boat people"" is intrinsically offensive like ""cockroach"" that you disingenuously compare it to. ""Boat people"" is an expression that emphasises that they are **people** rather than more abstract and dehumanising terms such as ""refugees"" or ""migrants"", as well as making **no reference to their origin** which might be latched onto by prejudiced individuals. It also makes a point of their extremely dangerous choice of transport, which if anything hints at the extreme circumstances they have been driven to.

This is an injustice; FSG should be ashamed!!!!"" rabble rabble rabble on the likes of Twitter and other social media and sometimes on here (although there is a lot of anti-Gerrard sentiment on here as well), but I always think to myself, ""No one is taking into account Stevie here.""

Sure, maybe the club could have done things a bit differently and things could have played out in another way, but at the end of the day, maybe this is just what Stevie wants to do. A chance to try something completely different. Who is anyone to deny him that?

This is a man who has lived in one place his entire life. He's done more for Liverpool Football Club and the city itself than anyone could ever ask of him. Is it not totally unfair to judge the man for choosing to try something completely new? A new league where he will almost assuredly start every game (which is what he wants), a city with a climate and a lifestyle almost entirely opposite to Liverpool and a chance to give his girls and wife an experience that not many have the opportunity to give. He's a young man in the prime of his life with the money to do some awesome stuff, why not take advantage of it?

I also think that last season's end and the subsequent World Cup really took its toll on him and changed his thinking a lot. I honestly think it broke him a bit. He's had to endure something that no one should have to and subsequent taunts  and jeers from shitheads everywhere every game since must take it's toll, even on someone as mentally strong as Stevie. It wouldn't surprise me at all if at some point he didn't just think, ""Screw it, I'm over this. Time for something else.""

He'll be back one day, of that I'm sure. In what capacity is unclear. But right now, this is a perfect time for Stevie to start a new chapter of his life and to that I say, go 'ed Stevie lad.

* Other things being equal (which they aren't - see below) people from country 2 will seek work in country 1.  
* As a general rule, people from country 2 will have a lower standard of living than people in country 1.  
* Therefore they will accept lower wages for a given job than people from country 1 will.  
* This will lead to downward pressure on wages for that job in country 1. As the wages are higher than they would be in country 2 this will lead to some mixture of more people from country 2 being employed at that job, and people from country 1 accepting lower wages for it.  
* People from country 2 might also take/send their money home where it will likely have increased purchase power than it would in country 1. This will tend to make country 1 poorer.  
* As a result there will likely be fewer people in country 2 doing the same job so this would tend to produce upward pressure on wages for that job in country 2.  
* Eventually the wages in the two job markets would approach each other (country 1 would be lower than before and country 2 would be higher than before).  
  
So rather than a trickle-down effect you'd get a movement towards equilibrium in both countries.  
  
This movement would be good for workers in the poorer country (because of higher wages), good for employers in country 1 (because of lower wages), bad for employers in country 2 (because of higher wages) and bad for workers in the richer country (because of lower wages).  
  
That other things aren't equal is a factor in the extent to which this will happen. Cost of housing, transport, food, &amp;c. has to be low enough for workers from country 2 to be able to either commute to, or live in, country 1 while working. Likewise availability of housing, transport, food, &amp;c. has to be high enough to facilitate it.

&gt; That being said, I do think that some of the things you said are a bit unfair. First of all, don't ever compare Howard to De Gea. He's arguably going to be one of the best keepers the world has ever seen and he's just in another class compared to Howard. We don't have the money to afford anyone near his abilities so blaming all the goals on Howard's mistakes is a bit unfair. 

I wasn't trying to compare De Gea to Howard as you pointed out De Gea has been the standout keeper this year and he would look favourable to any quality keeper like Lloris for instance. I was trying to make the point that having a quality keeper makes all the difference and will save you points rather than costing you them. If the goal is to try and crack the top 4, why should we persist with an average keeper who's been far below par this season?

&gt; Secondly, I think you absolutely can use Europa as an excuse. Moyes may have fared better, but this competition is taxing nonetheless and especially under Martinezs style which requires a lot of player and ball movement. Moyes had more of a static play style that focused on long balls and defending well. It's just another style of play and this one (Martinezs) requires a bit more depth to be successful.

Fair point but surely Martinez should know the limitations that come with the style of play and committed to the idea of 7 new players to improve the quality in the squad. Instead what we got was a consolidation of the successful players we had on loan (Barry and Lukaku), Eto'o for 6 months, a massive downgrade from Deulofeu in Atsu (a player barely good enough for the league never mind a team that just missed out on 4th) and Besic who is apparently one for the future.



&gt; Thirdly, I know lukaku hasn't scored in way too long but he's providing for other players to score because most defenses are too concerned about lukaku to mark our other threats properly (case and point is mirallas goal against United). He opens other players up and I think that is an invaluable asset. On top of that the guy is very young still and I think he has done more than enough to prove he's a great player for his age. 

This one wasn't really that much of a dig at Rom but at the fact we have a team with zero creativity or goalscorers other than Rom. When Rom doesn't score we hardly do.

Through no fault of his, we did not get the application into them in time and they pulled the product with no notice at all  (it was popular and so they figured we should make some more money out of this).

They then offered us the replacement product. The interest rate change is quite small (an extra tenner a month), but they have added now added an 'arrangement fee' of £700.

So they want £200 to process the application, and then £700 to arrange the mortgage. A bit of a joke if you ask me. £200 in fee's to £1000 just because they can. 

Anyway, back on topic. Our agent seems very good and friendly. One thing that makes a difference with agents. If you get an 'DIP' (Decision in principle) which is a certificate to say the lender will agree to your mortgage as long as everything checks out (you have the deposit, and pass a credit check) and then follow up by saying you're not part of a chain, then they see you very differently. Quite often a chain can be a real mess, especially if the FTB's are not in good shape. If they know you will get a mortgage and only need to give a month or twos notice on your rental home, you become a lot more valuable to them.

Privatise everything, but small state responsible for mainaining law and order and contracts etc. The big difference between him and his former Conservative colleagues (and New Labour) is that he speaks out against the situation we have in railways, PFI in the NHS etc. and in-work benefits where the state subsidises or guarantees private profits, an opinion he shares with many on the left, including myself.

Basically, under Thatcher, Blair and Cameron, we have ended up with a crony capitalist system of Socialism for the rich (bank bailouts, in work-benefits without a living wage, guarunteed profits for train companies on state-owned infrastructure, PFI, getting private- or foreign state-owned- companies to build nuclear plants, and guarunteeing them an energy price for ?fifty years of at least double what it is now and rising with inflation, etc.) and Capitalism for the poor (benefit cuts, lack of full employment, powerless unions etc.). Carswell supports capitalism for all, basically.

Basically, we can all get fucked over the same, rather than the poor getting fucked over in favour of corporations. I disagree, but at least it's intellectually consistent and not hypocritical.

Edit: These opinions come from his comments in Owen Jones's *The Establishment*, an excellent book which I would recommend reading.

It's way too early to tell if anything anyone in this thread is saying is true, everyones playing the expert and summing up his entire character and political view based on very little information, saying things like ""people will see straight through him"" and ""he's not trustworthy"" is just beyond laughable.

Essentially what people are saying is the guy is rich so he must represent the rich and not care about average people, because he called some people in clubs ""trash"".. I've called c-list wannabes trash, I'm sure a lot of you have. I don't think some of you will be happy until there's a Labour leader that grew up on a council estate but at the same time worked his way up to put himself through a top uni like oxford (degrees from top Universities seem to be the pinnacle of acceptance for MPs), it's just a fantasy. 

Nobody is even objecting his views or policy decisions... Literally just character assassinations. This is why politics is so fucked, people make massive assumptions about people and figure anybody who is rich isn't to be trusted and can't possibly represent the average person.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Broad spectrum sunscreen: at least SPF 30, apply *and reapply* the recommended amount. That is *at least* half a teaspoon for face and neck, full shot glass for the body. At least SPF 15 is advocated for the general population but usually higher is recommended in photosensitive skin conditions (eg. rosacea).

You are not simply looking to avoid visible damage like tanning and burning but hidden damage that leads to conditions like rosacea or cancer. Sunscreen needs to be in place before you start the course of treatment. The Simple KTS Moisture Cream SFF 30 is well liked around here, in an airless pump bottle so convenient for carting around, rich texture with natural moisturising factors, currently on three for two at Boots (normally a very reasonable £4).

After that a super gentle cleanser, you don't want that stripping and dehydrating already dry skin. The Simple KTS Refreshing Wash is a good option and another product you could get on the Boots three for two offer.

Lanolin is a fantastic occlusive - it contains lipids the skin barrier can utilise (cholesterol, cholesterol esters). You can purchase medical grade as Lansinoh (marketed as nipple balm sorry). Otherwise I rate Lanolips from Boots, all the ones with SPF are tinted but the light pinks barely show on lips.

You can get CeraVe cream on Amazon, the most similar formulation wise Is Balneum PLUS which comes in two pack sizes, but that is not much cheaper than CeraVe. Quite a few of the regulars rate the Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum, packed with ingredients the skin barrier can use.

There are also some sunscreens and basic moisturising creams on prescription if your family doctor will prescribe them.

Even then they didn't resort to violence, they only formed a wall to stop the people breaking through to the guy being arrested. The second clip again shows an arrest, this time in a large crowd, the video claims they are causing violence by pushing people around, however it is clear from the video the people being pushed back are running over to the man being arrested, it's heavy handed tactics but there isn't much else they can do there, in a crowd of hundreds when there's only 6 of them they have to push people back or they'll be swamped.

Consider ALL your products as potential culprits: everything that touches that area even if only residues in the shower - shampoo, other hair products, shower gel, sunscreen, shaving stuff. Allergies or irritation can develop to anything at any time, that is more common that to a novel product or ingredient.

Ensure you are avoiding ingredients that are known to damage the skin barrier: sulphates, olefin sulfonates,. drying alcohol, fragrance, anything alkaline (some shaving soaps/ creams are). IMO an AHA is risky on skin that is already thinned, this can thin the protective horny layer. Acids also can easily collect in skin creases.

In general the skin barrier does not need the lipids found in coconut oil. Consider products containing skin identical lipids like ceramides, phytosphingosine, lanolin, beeswax, lecithin. Check out the moisturisers mega review in the sidebar.

Eczematous skin tends to be deficient in urea so products containing this can also be helpful - Even if you have no eczema patches now your history means your whole body is considered atopic. That basically means at risk of eczema/ dermatitis type reactions so skincare choices should work to prevent this. Hyaluronic acid is a decent humectant but cannot penetrate the skin barrier as urea can, 5% urea also works double duty by hydrating AND encouraging the skin's natural exfoliation process.

Lastly review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed all our governments recommendations.

Effectively yes, hence the talk of falling quality of life / wages etc. 

&gt; Well yeah, I think you have to be careful about that, but this current period of economic history is challenging a lot of orthodoxies. Governments have run up huge budget deficits (pretty much whether they tried austerity or not) yet interest rates haven't budged an inch. That is obviously due to the government's entanglement with central banks, but I'm not sure there has been a huge negative consequences to this. Maybe towards consumer debt, since the current paradigm punishes savers so they move their money around the economy.

Interest rates haven't budged an inch yet, because behind the scenes via the artifact of quantitative easing the owner of a lot of debt is....the central banks. If the Fed, BoE or ECB tried to unwind the positions they have created we'd be in a depression quicker than you can say ""Keynesian Policies"". 

In essence, the markets are saying ""we trust you not to fuck this up"" but that's coupled with a crushing reality that it is possible everyone will lose their shirts if/when this goes wrong. [Here](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2230579/Treasury-receives-35bn-money-Bank-England-QE-gilts-interest.html) for example you can see what is happening. It's basically a version of chase the lady. 

&gt; I wonder if the US, after a few more quarters of positive growth, are going to kick around raising interest rates to try and deleverage consumers. 

When interest rates rise - which in reality means that the government will no longer support economic stimulus then we will in all probability see a lot of consumer debt defaulting which the banks will take the hit for, but hopefully not cause another banking crisis.

Now, the BBC might point towards the 83% of the regular audience for BBC2 who are giving ratings of 7+ in defence, but these high ratings might be explained in other ways. 

In the last 20 years home we have seen the rise of the home entertainment system and view on demand technologies, which may have contributed to the rise in the use of PSBs.

There is still a bit of a disconnect between the internet and the television - lots of platforms have tried to make home entertainment systems internet compatible, but  I don't think that any have become mainstream yet.

At the moment, you have a choice between a communal home entertainment system, and a laptop. Families don't crowd around a laptop to watch television.

 But what happens when the majority of consumers have an easy choice between Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, illegal streaming, and PSB's, *on their television?*

I think at that point, the use of PSB's will fall.

We actually had that year already and it didn't do what you said it would do. It helped but I would argue the last 3 years of proving ourselves as top 4 challengers has proven more effective in attracting talent and keeping players. Its more important that this team slowly and steadily improves year to year then one high year and then a crash.

The chief arguments against Europa are using Liverpool and United as references because those two teams were able to play well and get top 4 after years out of the Europa League. But no one wants to talk about the fact that we are NOTHING like those teams.
 A. As much as we hate to admit it we do not have the name recognition or history like those clubs so attracting talent is tougher. B. We dont have the wage structure of those squads so we cant pay top talent high wages as a way to offset not being in CL. C. We dont have an owner who has shown a desire to spend tons of money even if we wont recoup all of it back. (UNITED BROKE THE BANK THIS SUMMER)  So while yes not being in Europa didnt hurt them everyone knew that those team would recover. Spurs dont have that history we cant just assume that dropping to 7th or maybe 8th wont seriously damage the way players look at spurs and effect their desire to join.

Also our highest point total in the Premier League and 3 of our 4 highest totals came in years that we were in the Europa League so the idea that playing well in the league is impossible if you are in Europa is a myth.

It makes striking completely pointless, a strike is meant as a last resort that cannot be ignored, its a trump card that forces both sides back to the table.

I was tasked with throwing away thousands of pounds of food that could have gone to good use when I was working in a supermarket.

I understand that the company do not want to 'cheapen' their brand by giving away free products, I understand that there's potentially legal difficulties (sue the supermarket because that out of date yoghurt gave you the runs) but these are not insurmountable challenges.

The fact is the supermarket companies do not even try to be socially responsible and to overcome these challenges, instead preferring to just waste what must be hundreds of tons of food every week across the country.

We were even told to stop heavily discounting stuff to get it sold, I had always just taken bread items etc. down to 10-20p at the end of the night to get rid of them, and it worked, but an area manager saw this as cheapening the brand and put a stop to it.  He preferred to see it go in the bin than even bring in some money.

There should be a requirement for supermarkets to redistribute the food that they cannot sell to good causes that can then quickly get it out to people in need.  I'm not talking about feeding people out of date meat, dairy products etc. but the fact is that most of what is thrown out is fine for at least the next 24 hours and it's obvious to the individual shop what is going to sell and what isn't.  At this stage it should be identified and distributed to people in need, not left to sit on a shelf at half price and then chucked in a bin at 11pm.

I deliberately seperated bread, shelf stable stuff etc. into separate bags for disposal and never locked the bins.  Maybe I live in an affluent area but I never saw anyone dumpster diving for it, it was all I could do though.  Some places require the food to be put in locked bins, I've even heard of using bleach to contaminate it.

Yes. Labour have lost millions of votes to the Greens, Plaid, UKIP and SNP. I'm not sure they ever get the latter back, but they could get votes back from the first three.

There's something like a dozen seats Labour could have won if the Green vote was added on to them, and Labour did terribly in Wales, relatively speaking - they *lost* a seat.  UKIP finished second in a whole bunch of Northern constituencies and probably buttressed Tory majorities up north. 

Now not every UKIP/Plaid/Green voter is a disaffected Labour voter, but many are and those people voted for Tony Blair in 1997 and 2001 and then walked off. 

&gt; And can they be courted without losing other important votes?

Easily. Every Labour leader to win a majority has been a broad church leader. Blair was easily the most divisive but people forget his first government passed a load of social reforms, redistributed more income than any government since Harold Wilson, and had loads of old lefties like Frank Dobson in ministerial posts. 

This is a little bit of why I was hoping Dan Jarvis would run and win, he is a bit of a blank slate with an appealing personal story. Probably tilts Blairite but he's had such a short run in Parliament that you could build a policy portfolio around him that threw some meat to the middle-class lefties, threw some meat to the working class, and threw some meat to the soft nationalists. Like Blair I: FOIA and HRA for the MC lefties, Sure Start and the minimum wage for the working class, and devolution for the soft nationalists. That's how you end up with the 2001 election where barely anybody campaigned as Labour had it in the bag from day 1.

Even Tony Blair admitted in his Observer article that he'd got it wrong on income inequality, and I get the sense that the other Blairites like Mandelson and Umunna, with their risible sucking up to ""aspirational"" voters, don't get it. 

Labour needs to make their core tenets - fairness, social justice, inclusiveness - matter to aspirational voters by reminding them how it applies to them, rather than just try and ape what the Tories used successfully while not going as far.

Walcott, no way he would go to Chelsea anyways, and I don't think he would be an improvement to Willian or Cuadrado.

An electric shower will only use energy when you're actually having a shower, which may be a benefit.

When they asked who he was I told them he was ""Britain's next Prime Minister"", and he still has a great chance of being exactly that. A few reasons why he may not be though:

1: He's managing to piss off the Scots already and has form in pissing off other groups (Liverpool for example). He may not then have the base of support across the whole UK to be a good leader for the Tories (although they couldn't do much worse in those areas).

2: He is eminently capable of messing up his portfolio (whichever that is) when he stops being mayor and is given a senior role. Give him a hard job such as delivering EU reform and he's likely to struggle (as anyone would).

3: We have the South East runway decision coming soon. If Heathrow expansion is chosen he may well resign from his new cabinet position. That will give him some enemies.

4: Don't underestimate other runners and riders in the Tory party. George Osborne would probably think he deserves a go if he is still Chancellor in a few years time. Sajid Javid may continue to rise and doesn't have the background that annoys so many of the electorate.

5: Boris' personal life is scurrilous. Plenty of opportunity for more pretty sordid scandal to come out and scupper his chances.

For instance while in the whole of England at this election the Conservatives increased their vote by 1.5% and Labour theirs by 3.7%, in London those figures are 7.1% and 0.5% respectively. The same from 2005-10, Labour did much better than the average, the Tories worse. 

Why? Because of the rapidly changing demographics. Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by 1 million people, but the number of white British people in the city dropped by over 600 thousand. The share of the population went from 59.8% to 44.9%. 

Ethnic minority voters vote Labour by an overwhelming majority, and while this continues to be the case Labour will do very well in  a London where soon white people will be a minority, and in the case of white British people we already are.

Really? :)  So, the general libertarian argument is that ""gay rights"" (lets keep this to, say, upgrading marriage-related rights to be in parity with hetero couples) *legitimises state intervention in what should be an entirely private affair*.

In other words, the government has zero business being in the marriage game in the first place - no couple, whatever their professed, perceived or private genders and/or sexual orientation should require government approval (just think about that for a second) and thus advocating the piecemeal extension of those rights to another group would be a violation of that principle. If one is against capital punishment, you don't argue against it by ensuring the ""right"" people are executed, you argue against the core principle of the thing.

Furthermore, do we have to have this same fight every time we realise group X are missing marriage rights? Just abolish the authoritarian idea of goverment-sanctioned relationships and the whole problem is fixed for eternity. This isn't just a practical point either; one shouldn't need pre- *or* post-approval for where you want to put your sexual organs. Assuming it's consensual.

You might respond that the various tax breaks etc. associated with marriage would require some notion of state recognition, but these (actually rather tame) tax breaks are part of the problem to begin with as well, as being an easy price to pay for fairness if nobody had them.

(Hey, you might also respond that people who take this stance are simply masking their homophobia, but that kind of cheap, unfalsifiable and bad faith argument style is probably more of the problem than actual fear of homosexuals. My experience is that people who dislike gays are helpfully pretty forthcoming about it.)",null,0,null,1431443938,null,0,false,0,cr6mv4c,null,t3_35os09,null,t1_cr6mv4c,null,t1_cr6gaiy,null,null,null,1432914582,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

**First of all:**

&gt; when we get into the champions league is your plan to play our youth as well?

That is not for me to decide, but I can wish that we play whatever *make sense*. For instance, is it a weak Ludogorets side that we *should* be able to beat? Play some young players (most of our starting 11 is young players anyway...).


**Secondly:**

I am not sure what you're trying to say here... You're trying to argue, that playing CL with our best 11 will take too much of a toll on our players?

But Europa League wont?...

Have you ever heard the expression ""aim for the stars""? You should always aim for the highest level of competition, CL in this case, no matter what.

As I tried to argue, there is very little experience benefit for our players in Europa League. 

The competition is weaker and until the later stages, we'll play sides that are equal to the mid-table sides in the Prem. For me, it's just another carling cup, a chance to play the younger players who don't get to play in the Prem on a weekly basis.

Money wise we don't benefit from it either, unless we win it. And if we need to win it, we need to play our best players.


There shouldn't be a ""aim for CL/aim for Europa League"" question. There's only one goal: To end as high up in the league table as possible. CL/Europa League is just a bonus. And yes, Europa League is better than nothing. I'm not on the ""rather nothing than Europa League""-team. There's still more money involved compared to not playing it - but it's not a solid choice *over* Champions League, no matter how you look at it.


In Denmark, the champions of the national league get to  *qualify* for Champions League - and for everyone, it's the ultimate goal. Even though the top teams are worse than our reserves on a good day. Would it make more sense for the danish teams to play in the Europa League because it's more suited to their level? No. Playing at the highest level of competition gives the biggest experience reward.

Generally speaking, to progress you usually say you need to play 70% against people at your level, 20% above your level, and 10% below your level.

Playing Europa League gives *very little* compared to the Premier League. CL would give *a lot* even to our most experienced players.

Cameron is trapped - he can't take any other course of action now. Either he angers the public, as he's doing, with a terribly right-wing Cabinet, or he could pick more (relatively) progressive ministers and anger his back bench MPs, which would certainly lead to rebellion and the collapse of his government.

Over time you kinda just decide who to trust based on track record.

Then you'll come across random characters on Twitter who seem privy to insider knowledge. Kevin Gallen's mates, for example - one of them alleged that he heard Vargas was feigning injury 2-3 months back.

You then just cross-reference it all to what you see on a match day - and it all made sense to me that Ramsey was dealing with some dickheads. There's really no other explanation for the woeful, static, defensive teams he's fielded, as Zarate, Isla and Traoré (maybe even Adel himself) would all have been logical inclusions under normal circumstances, where we needed points urgently.

Adel's Instagram was particularly telling though - I don't know who the Italian was that he and Isla were dining with, but given his desire to get out there and Isla's parent club Juventus...you're gonna raise an eyebrow.

* The graph for dialysis of UREA UREA UREA  is curved because of diffusion  
* You can round the ratio one to 1:3, because if you imagine the percentages from the genetic diagram its 25% and 75%  
* The question on the ancient bird was a weird way but was focused around specification. The 4 points can be found in the specification.  
* Fusarium is a fungus.  
* The 6 mark question in B2 was focused around: Creating a transect, recording light intensity and the average area every X meters. And lastly to make it valid, you have to repeat the experiment on another day/location? And keep variables? (Not sure) 
* Robber was B  
* The increase in waste question was about an increased population and increased quality of life  
* The way oxygen enters the blood is a mix of mentioning heamoglobin and diffusion! Not one and not the other!  
* The magnification was 400. Due to different units!  
* 4 uses of glucose for plants! This one, fuck this one! So on the specification it only mentions 3: Cellulose, produce proteins, produce fat or oil for storage. So that means the last one could be anything, some guesses: Produce seeds, respiration (wrong because of question title), storage as insoluble starch (Might be part of fats and oils, if not, its the most likely)  
* Fish one: You had to mention only 1 method (eg. thin diffusion pathway, large surface area, possible good blood supply) and then say it increases diffusion (It never mentions diffusion in the questions, its an annoying question where you state the obvious) WHICH allows the fish to absorb oxygen faster!
* Heart was muscular tissue.
* In the circulatory system they TRANSPORT: Urea and C02 (You cannot mention permanent residents of blood, that's next question)  
* In blood, you can mention: Soluble products of digestion and platelets.
* The percentage for waste was 41.5%, the question related to it just required a ton of stats and general patterns? (I think)
*The gas in the fermentater was Oxygen, and the liquid was Sugar Syrup.
* The balloon at the bottom of the glass (To represent the lungs) was the diaphragm.  
* The second part to the question above, when the balloon is pulled down. The volume inside the glass increases so the pressure decreases. This then draws air into the balloons due to the pressure difference.",null,0,null,1431446288,null,0,1431448303,0,cr6ocg6,null,t3_35pvep,null,t1_cr6ocg6,null,t3_35pvep,null,null,null,1432915280,null,7,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,7,null

Ah, I didn't know about Scotland, but no, in England and Wales it's not.  I don't really know the reasoning behind it - although you can arrest for it, it is not a separate offence, it merely justifies bringing the person back into police custody where, if they cannot be charged (because the evidence is lacking), they must be immediately released on bail again.  Police officers don't even bother to arrest for breach of police bail because it's such a toothless tiger - you just do a statement for it and the court can use it in determining whether to grant bail if the person is eventually charged.

Breach of court bail (imposed by magistrates following a hearing and distinct from police bail) means the person is brought back before the court who may then remand them in custody or take other measures to secure their compliance with the conditions, but again, it is not itself a criminal offence.

The only criminal offence with relation to bail in E+W is failure to surrender to custody at the appointed time.",null,0,null,1431446363,null,0,false,0,cr6oe51,null,t3_35pb11,null,t1_cr6oe51,null,t1_cr6nrqr,null,null,null,1432915301,null,2,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

The US doesn't have to do very much. It is the ultimate safe haven for money in that if the US stops being the safe place to put your money then the world is proper fucked. The EU, UK and Japan have major currencies (and the Euro is growing in importance) but the dollar is still king. So long as the US avoids war with Russia and China it can pretty much do what it likes. 

The QE undergone by the Fed is truly epic, I have no idea how they intend to unwind this. I can only presume that they dont and eventually the money will inflate away but this will take a long, long time. 

Northern Europe, is mostly, well run. Germany has a massive surplus and has undergone a lot of reforms since unification which should not be underestimated. Similarly Sweden had a banking crisis earlier and was in a better shape thanks to that. 

France is our more direct competitor in the sense that we're probably most alike. It has much stronger social protection for workers than the UK and you can see this in how far and fast both countries contracted relative to each other and how each has grown afterwards. France didn't shrink as much and is growing very slowly, UK plunged but is bouncing back quicker, the net effect is probably not that much different but the dynamic nature of the respective economies is more interesting in the long term.

As you said, many Club Med countries had austerity as did Ireland and the UK was in that same league for this because of the out-sized banking sector we have and the sheer volume of trade we do in the financial sector. Any banking crisis will affect the UK more than other countries, even relative to GDP. France doesn't have such a big banking sector, neither does Germany. They are tiny compared to London. Indeed, London's only competitor for finance is New York.

If ever there is a crisis in manufacturing cars then Germany will be the one in trouble :)

Other countries had other avenues (natural resources) or different profiles. There is never a one-size fits all policy and to be blunt you can solve these things a lot of different ways, the result will be similar (poor get shafted, middle classes feel the pinch, the rich wonder what all the fuss is about) but how it manifests will be different (lower wages, wage cuts, high inflation, fewer jobs). 

Given we had a Tory government who tend towards the small government it was the inevitable choice for them ideologically speaking. Was it right?

If you don't have constant improvement in workers rights wages stagnate. 
This doesn't even require a socialist angle to demonstrate. 
When wages stagnate your only choice is to build a society based on personal debt.
Personal debt only functions as a whole as long as wages increase.
Furthermore, overall productivity gains are significantly lower if the cost of labor is cheaper; instead of training staff to get better and faster or investing in machinery you can pour more staff at the problem.
If we want to ""fix"" the economy we need higher wages, the alternative is more and more stagnation.

You hit a very key point in that article regarding the defence. They know their limitations. You haven't seen the defence take chances that could possibly put the team in a risky position and put defending the goal no-matter-what at the heart of their attitude. We have seen far too many mistakes at the back this season, many leading to goals that simply shouldn't have happened, possibly due to the style of play, maybe it's unfortunate circumstances each time, either way by not understanding the limitations we suffer.

This isn't just a defence situation though. Chelsea this season have been incredible with their game attitude thanks to Mr. Mourihno. Martinez has a pass-possession-pass play-style. Mourihno has a we-will-beat-your-play-style-and-you-can't-stop-us... play-style. Look at when they visited the emirates, or when they played against United, they played a game which cut the opposition out the game by removing how they play. Get the goal and sit back. DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN.

Martinez doesn't do this.

Martinez has only incorporated this successfully once this season (in my opinion) and that was a few weeks when we beat United 3-0. I was their at the game that day and I haven't seen us play that well all season in the premier league. No one had a bad game that day. Why did we do so well? Because we didn't play our usual style of football. We played to United's weakness, and let them make their own mistakes, and countered effectively.

And that's what we need to learn from Chelsea. It doesn't matter how beautiful the three points look, three points are better than one or none.

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"I wrote this in another post, but I don't think Griezmann means the end of Oscar/Willian/Cuadrado at Chelsea. The way I see it is it allows Jose a lot more flexibility and versatility when it comes to the squad, and his ability to rotate, and change it in-game. I think what this truly means the end of is Fabregas at the No. 10 position. 

I would imagine that Hazard-Oscar-Griezmann behind Costa would be the desired starting XI. 

That leaves our bench to be Rob Green, Luis (or someone else if he leaves), Zoom Zoom, Rami, Willian, Cuadrado, and Remy. Because Griezmann can play up top as a striker, you still have 3 strikers in the squad in effect. Having Willian on the bench would mean that Fabregas would never really have to move into the No. 10 position. Plus having such a quality bench like this in theory would be might make Jose ACTUALLY use his subs more. 

You're right about Griezmann and what he could do for this team though. I've said this team lacks another elite goal threat to be a contender in Europe besides Hazard and Costa, and he'd definitely provide it. And if we keep the rest of our team intact, we'd have an elite bench as well. If we can get Griezmann the summer window would be a success for me.

Fast forward to after the season. England job is gone and Harry is going into the last year of his contract. What does he say now? He says the performance on the pitch will suffer if he isn't given a new deal. He says the players will be distracted if they don't know who the manager will be the year after. He publicly threatens a shitty season if he's not given an extension.

The guy is trash. His track record of being a self-serving weasel is well-documented. His track record of being nothing more than a stop-gap manager is well-documented.

Honestly , most people who defend Redknapp can't help but throw in some vaguely xenophobic barb. It's always ""Levy wanted a fancy foreign manager and a continental structure.""

I guess it goes back to the current accounts problem the UK has had for 30+ years now. Thatcher gets a lot of blame for this on the left but I'm under the impression it wasn't rosy before her anyway; due to our basically mercantilist economy for many years we got really fat on other people's goods and the goods we did produce during our period of nationalised industries were not of sufficient quality to pay the wages the people, the trade unions, and both parties (considering the Tories were quite wet) wanted to pay. Jokes about Rolls-Royce with ""adequate"" power, right? They were giving up 100 bhp on German equivalents. 

Fixing that is going to require a paradigm shift from all political parties. The Labour left (which I'm a member of) probably feels the rosiest about manufacturing but where do you find the investment to build factories and staff them with workers capable of making exceptionally high quality goods? Do they exist? We don't have a lot of natural resources - North Sea oil isn't going to help out on this front forever and coal mining is increasingly politically untenable due to climate change. The UK could be leaders in things like tech, green industries and whatnot but they aren't massively labour intensive industries. 

The two things I can think of that will ameliorate this situation are massive wealth redistribution and enormous amounts of investment in education. The first is a problem as capital will always be one step ahead of the taxman (though I'd argue we could certainly do more on this front) and the second is a very long-term proposition. Unquestionably it will help but unemployed South Yorkshire man who left school at 14 and hasn't had a steady job since the mines closed...well, that guy is almost completely redundant to our modern economy. The dole is just about his only option. 

I know Osborne is trying to take steps to decrease the dependence on finance and London that the UK has, but for ideological reasons I don't know if he'll be successful because you really need a gigantic pile of money to make it work, and the Treasury doesn't have that right now.

Uni negotiate with them, discuss all reasonable requests. Hijackers say that isn't good enough, continue protesting, disrupting exams, damaging property, etc until university is forced to evict them. 

The portfolio and list of demands reads like tumblr met up, got drunk, took drugs and decided that they were good ideas. 

Some gems include wanting to make police unwelcome on campus, trigger warnings (remember that Goldsmiths is well known for experimental post modern avant garde confrontational Art), and cutting ties with any company that invests in fossil fuels. 

They do have some good points. Most of them were either already being dealt with or already on the table for discussion.

I'll name and shame [Roberts](http://www.robertsproperty.co.uk/) in Bournemouth as being a Listed Grade I cunt packager. 6 of us rented a shared property for our final year of uni (single lease HMO, not individual rental) which ran us:

* £125 deposit fee

* £250 admin fee

* First month rent up front

* One month rent security deposit.

So thats £1,125 (each) before we've moved in for 6 students. On that single property, Roberts took (In fees) £2,250 plus what ever percentage of rent the landlord was charged for a single property.

Our paperwork was delayed, we had our move in date pushed back twice due to ""busy schedules"". No shit was it busy, it's MOVE IN WEEK FOR UNIVERSITY so we had to harass the agents to allow us to move in in order to bloody sign on at Uni on time.

During our stay we had three no notice property viewings from Roberts. We obliged the first viewing provided it didn't occur again. The next two we turned them away and received verbal warnings of being uncooperative with the agency would result in penalty charges. The final straw was when a real *cunt* of an agent let herself into our property to show another group of students around at 9am on a Wednesday. Fucking hell did she get an ear full and three seconds away from a police call.

Our inventory took three months to arrive, we refused to sign it and updated it with a current (ie, 3 months moved in) inventory which they actually signed. On moving out they reverted back to the original unsigned inventory and attempted to claim damages and cleaning, gardening and general property upgrades (new front door as wooden one was old?!) on us, magically costing the exact total of all 6 of our security deposits. In the end our wonderful landlord, whom had the final say, reduced the damages fee to £0 as he went through and found nothing to be at fault.

Then comes the checking out fee, something that the UK didn't then protect against.

£250 each please in admin fees to leave your property.

Build up of income won't save us from relegation, and we've got a *long* wait until the youth system starts to really bear fruit.

We'll never build up to the point where we can splash the cash in the way you seem to suggest we need to, not more than we could right now while we still have Bony money burning a hole in our pocket. That is just something that is not attainable for us as a club of our size and model (and I wouldn't sacrifice that either). 

I wouldn't call it 'scared' though, just heavily cautious, with an element of having been manipulated by the footballing world these days into believing that stretching yourself thin to try and achieve something is a bad thing to do.

Let me put it this way - we won't be in this league forever. Eventually, we *will* go down. We might come back again too, but even the most cautious behaviour won't save us from an eventual unlucky season, awful manager, mismanagement or any other combination of things. Now with that in mind, think of Bolton - they established themselves as a top flight club for a very good spell. What are they remembered for? The numerous midtable seasons, or that year they had a good go in the UEFA Cup? Fulham too, and to a lesser extent Middlesborough.

I look at it this way - we can either worry about what we'll be doing next season, or we can think about what we'll be remembering and still talking about decades from now. If we finished between 8th and 14th every season for the next five years without winning a domestic cup, it's nothing to turn your nose up at but it won't be something you get giddy talking about to your kids when they're just getting into football.

That was a team put together out of a bad situation.

Gylfi was a striker until Gomis came on and he didn't track back a huge amount to suggest otherwise.

There are some comparisons to be drawn to Chelsea against top teams and us last night, but not to the extent this article makes out. If we had a slightly fitter squad (Naughton, Routledge and Gomis in particular), we'd have played a reasonable amount more positively.

From the outset I don't like the attitude Labour took towards a EU referendum - 'you can't have one because you might vote the wrong way' - imagine the howls of indignation if the same thing had been said about a Scottish Independance referendum?

Moreover, the European Union is in many ways an exceptionally undemocratic institution that seems wedded to the doctrine of austerity (or, at least, Germany - master of the Eurozone - is). You only need to look at the way Greece has been treated to see that. But the most glaring issue is that of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being negotiated by the EU. Now, there's an awful lot wrong with the TTIP (as this website here explains in more detail: http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/ttip-biggest-threat-uk-sovereignty.html) and the European Union had the arrogance to block the Citizen's Initiative Against the TTIP (as another article from the same websites explains in more detail: http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/ttip-eu-citizens-initiative-democracy.html).

We found that pressuring the agents tended to get us our way, or should i say, the legal way. Though if Roberts continues to brush you aside i strongly suggest you contact [The Property Ombudsman](http://www.tpos.co.uk/consumer_guide_rents.htm) which they are registered with.

They may be unable to do anything other than slap Roberts on the wrist *but* it will be another black mark against them and will credit other cases in the future if that isn't the case already.

null,false,pierrottheclown1,null,null,null,"Ive been working in mental health for a couple of years now and the advice about self referral that Kawasutra provided is very important. Increasingly IAPT services have moved from being run by the NHS directly to being run by third sector providers outside the NHS (for instance Mind run the IAPT service in London, Harrow), so its worth doing some independent research as your GP may well not be aware of all the services that are available near you (even though some only accept GP referrals) 

Depending on the area you live in you can also self refer to some crisis teams (confusingly in some areas such as bristol these are known as 'intensive teams' or in Surrey 'home treatment teams', you can find their numbers via the NHS website for your area), these teams are designed to help people as an alternative to hospital admissions, but generally see a wide range of patients with mental health issues. Teams will have someone on call 24/7 who can take a referral, thereby allowing you in some cases to bypass the GP. 

Many areas of the country also have a dedicated crisis line that is directly linked to the NHS services in your area, they can help you find services near you.  For those at risk of homelessness there are also crisis houses and I think some of these also take self referrals.

If you have a mental health issue and are finding it difficult to navigate the system its also worth looking into advocacy services and trying to find a mental health advocate, who can lobby services on your behalf. Most areas of the country have specific advocacy services that are run by charities (e.g. Matrix Advocacy Services), they can help locate services that may be relevant to you. They are also sometimes viewed as a third party who can help to resolve disputes between patients and other healthcare services.

A number of trusts have also set up recovery colleges, that run educational courses and workshops for people experiencing mental health issues. Central and Northwest London NHS have set one up in London as part of a growing initiative (http://www.cnwl.nhs.uk/recovery-college/contact-us/)

I think qualifying via league play is much more likely for the following reasons:

1. Clubs that drop-out of champions league from group play go into Europa making the competition considerably harder to win.
2. Europa matches tend to be refereed at a lower caliber which means more randomness and luck to move forward.    I think there is a bias against physical play which is another strike against any PL club, including Spurs.
3. Beyond the group stage, it's a knockout cup.   Consistency is rewarded in the group stage and then goes out the window in match leg format where some luck is required.

null,false,Galerath,null,null,null,"Mixed. First lot were fucking awful. Bitched about the rent constantly despite me charging below market rate, and left the place a disaster area. Had to deep clean and repaint the entire flat because when I told them to open the sodding windows to avoid mold, they decided to instead keep the windows closed all day and leave the heating off. Annoyingly the DPS (Deposit Protection Service) didn't refund nearly enough to cover all this and instead handed the bastards back half the deposit. I was rather annoyed. 

Second lot were fantastic, kept the place spotless, paid the rent on time etc. I happily returned the full deposit.

Current lot are alright. Keep the flat nice but keep forgetting to pay the rent or accidentally paying too little. As a result I have to keep an eagle eye on my bank statement and chase them if they forget. I don't think they have been doing it on purpose but it's a minor annoyance.

My tips would be:

1: DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. Take pics of the inside of the flat before tenants move in, and after they leave. The DPS are thorough so you need to be too if you have to claim back against the deposit.

2: Speak to prospective tenants: get a good idea of who they are, what they do etc. Don't be afraid to turn someone away if you don't have confidence in them to pay up or look after your property. Be very weary of students for obvious reasons (And many home insurance/landlord insurance companies won't cover student lets!).

3: If something goes wrong/needs doing, fix it fast. I've found that the better I am to the tenant, the easier they are to deal with. (Aside from the first lot. Should really have turned them away).

Note that BG Homecare is useless for non-gas properties and trust me, there's a lot more that can go wrong than the boiler!

And frankly I don't think these lot know what the fuck they're talking about. It's not really like he forced us to sign those players, we wanted those players, Mendes is the best at sourcing people.

Take Jose's story of how he got Mendes. He asked multiple agents about meeting with Abramovich to discuss moving to Chelsea. Several agents started to string Jose along. Telling him things like he'd meet Jose in Monaco in a week or something.

Meanwhile, when he received this Monaco message he was sitting eating dinner with Mendes and Abramovich.

Or the story went something along those lines.

The reason everything usually involves Mendes in some capacity is because he has such deep connections to everything that goes on everywhere. He is incredibly adept at getting things done to the timescale people demand of him and he does his job incredibly well, for himself, for his clients and for clubs that ask him to do something.

It's not much of an exaggeration to say Mendes works very, very closely with Chelsea, and Atletico too tbf.

Alec Salmond was leader of the SNP for a long time without making any particularly incredible strides of progress. Stood down and let a fella Swinney take over. They had some bad elections and Salmond came back, reinvigorated and leading the party to heights they'd never achieved before.

Nigel Farage was leader of UKIP for numerous years, making moderate progress and vote increase but not earth shattering. Stood down (some sort of internal wrangling I think) and let this real old duffer Lord Pearson run the party. He was a disaster and Farage came back, all forgiven, and again, seemingly reinvigorated and with new authority to do things he obviously thought should be done.

Kind of like the time away from the daily pressures of the leadership role helps you see what actually matters more and how your time as a leader can be better spent (can't imagine the amount of tedious time-wasting crap you could let yourself get into as a party leader if you don't know better). Also, your party members are less angsty and moany, knowing the potential alternatives to your leadership are in fact worse.

Durkan might be able to do the same, who knows?

Some little things to fix before though:

-finding an Assembly seat he could take (a move to South Belfast to take Dr Who's seat? Bit unusual for the SDLP to mix things up in this way. They're a fairly ""local representatives for local people"" party)

You have a legal right to the minimum wage, why should they be paid more than that if there are people willing to do the job for that pay? Why should they have legal protection while holding a company hostage to get more than that?

If the minimum wage is not sufficient for them to live on then shouldn't that be the case for other industries too? In which case surely the problem is the level at which the minimum wage is set and *that is what should be fixed*.

Personally I am of the opinion that the minimum wage is too low and needs to be increased. You should have no legal right to any more than that and that extends to striking.

null,false,fussydutchman,logo,,null,"While FFP is certainly a joke, this article is poorly written. One thing that everyone loves to point out is how much debt a club has. Debt is not inherently bad, especially when it comes to large corporations or businesses. As much as I hate them, United's debt level is irrelevant. They have some of the highest revenues in the world for clubs and that steady stream of revenue isn't going away. Their debt has been decreasing over the past few years and as long as they're able to service their debts and pay all of their other expenses then it doesn't really matter. I can't speak as much to Inter's financial situation since I'm not as familiar, but they seem to have more of an issue. From my understanding (again I don't know much about Inter) they have had issues with falling revenue. Increasing amounts of debt and falling revenue can be a nasty combination. 

The writer of the article goes on to display their lack of knowledge on capital structure by saying that:
&gt; City demonstrated last year that their debt had been massively cut and they were heading for profit, which they expect to achieve this year.

City does not have any debt because of Mansour. He injected capital into the club on his own so that they would not have to raise it by other means (i.e. issuing debt, taking out loans, or issuing stocks). Last year, City halved their LOSSES.

At least with Borini he came from a top club (Chelsea) and had experience playing in a top side (Roma).

Ings doesn't have either of those things going for him. He'll be 23 by the start of next season. He won't be first choice or even 2nd choice. He won't get game time and he won't improve. We'll end up selling him to West Ham for 3m. For both parties involved it would be better if he went elsewhere.

We have Origi coming in and Sinclair just making his league debut. We should save the Ings transfer fee to add to the money for a top striker to compete with Sturridge, which would make 4 strikers (assuming Balotelli, Borini and Lambert leave).

&gt; Ethiad as a brand sponsors the stadium and the shirt 

That deal is for 40m a year, 20m each for the stadium and the shirt. 

Arsenal meanwhile get 30m a year for printing 'Fly Emirates' on their shirts, while United get 47m from Chevrolet. 

In such an atmosphere, this is clearly a fair amount, and in their analysis of the clubs finances for FFP, UEFA ruled that this was a fair valuation of the deal.

&gt;... the brand is owned by the owner of the club

This is just patently untrue. Etihad is owned by the United Arab Emirates, City's owner is one member of the Royal Family of *one* of those seven emirates.

That's like saying Prince Harry own's the Royal Bank of Scotland.

(to be perfectly clear, since you're probably not from the UK, Prince Harry doesn't own the Royal Bank of Scotland)

&gt; Wonder how that is legal. 

Again, ask UEFA. They're the ones who ruled that it was legal, and they're the ones who make the rules, so I'd trust them here.

It's not as overt any more because it's not socially acceptable, but it's snide comments, absolutes and stereotypes like 'Oh what else do you expect from a white woman' and 'Yeah Black people are like that, they're always going to do x'. I think people see racism as very differently to how it actually operates nowadays, it's not like 1920s Alabama. It's like they genuinely see black and white people as an alien species but conveniently the ones they know and keep at an arms length just happen to be friendly and nice. I'm thinking of that Louis Theroux piece where the leader of the largest neo-nazi movement in the USA has a black/hispanic friend, in fact they both considered each other as friends. 

Growing up I was never allowed to have white/black kids from my neighbourhood come round, but sometimes ones from my north London private school were. I remember when I was 12 one of my mates who was black from my area invited me round for his birthday but my mum didn't let me go because 'then we'd have to invite Zach back over to our house' at some point. She actually sat me down to explain this to me and I can still see that patronizing look on her face as she said it. They'd never say 'no white or black friends', they'd screen their names in true Katie Hopkins-esq form and subtly ask questions about them and their parents before delivering a verdict. 

Oh yeah the worst overt verbal racism is reserved for muslims/Pakistanis, but for some reason my parents were fine with them coming round. Racism is weird. Also another thing is, because my parents were racially abused in the 70s, 80s and 90s and my dad violently on a couple occasions, whenever they are mistreated in public they always always are assured and paranoid that it's because of racism. That I can understand but my older sister thinks like that too even though, to my knowledge at least, has never been racially abused herself.

From the reporting on the disabled fund changes, you would think that IDS is promoting a huge wheelchair bonfire in Parliament Square.

It is implied that anyone who voted tory is somehow motivated by self interest, prejudice, stupidity or has been brainwashed by Murdoch. It of course has nothing to do with, record unemployment, fastest growing country in Europe and David Cameron considered to be an immeasurably better candidate for PM than Ed Miliband.

I think even the most hard core Ed fan would admit that Ed is nothing on Harold Wilson, and we live in a country that is remarkably different to what it was 40 years ago. The problem is the kind of anti aspiration and anti-business tone that they gave off is just not representative of people in this country. If it is not representative now, after a huge financial crisis and a centre right party implementing austerity, it never will be.

He should have hired a former player/manager/football agent to advise him on how a club is run. Someone with connections to the team, instead of his business friends. Someone who can show him, yes we need to balance the books and its something that all clubs have a hard time doing, but we need to keep our customers i.e the fans. 

He should have taken a year or 2 to get to know how its works before giving his input. 

The way he handled the rebranding was a farce. He would have been better giving fans a seasons notice. Hold genuine consultations with fans on badge design, kit design etc. Even then if he just went with his own choice the fans would have believed he took an interest. 

We would have had a ""last ever"" blue kit, which would have sold out in hours. We would had time to grieve and to get used to it. 

If he had a real football adviser we wouldn't have spent a ridiculous  amount of money on transfer fees and wages. He wouldn't have had to pay as much too get rid of managers. We would not be in so much debt.

Aubamejang sounds like the best striker available that's remotely possible for us to get. Should throw everything at him.

As for DM, that's tricky. We need someone quicker, less injury-prone &amp; more athletic then Lucas (who's still a great 2nd option). Not sure De Jong is really that big an upgrade tbh while Can looks more like a B2B player. Schneiderlain is the obvious one but Southampton will want a fortune for him.

There is no long history of institutional racism that non-whites have suffered. This girl might be an idiot, but so are the people ignoring any context and seeing this as bad as racism that non-whites suffer in this country. I have a middle-class black friend who is extremely harmless, and he has suffered stuff like police accusing him of shoplifting, checking him for drugs etc. A white person would not suffer this discrimination based on race, only on class, and that's more physically ambiguous.

Do you have a strong accent?  Do you look very different to most Brits?  I can't imagine what someone would want to pick on with you.

Do you understand the difference between banter and rudeness? Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference.  It can be a British thing to ""insult"" a person, but it means the person is actually being ""close"".

e.g. my co-worker for the last year is worried about putting on weight. The other day he said, ""Why am I getting so fat?"" to which I replied, ""Because you're a bastard"". ""Fat bastard"" is a saying in England.

He thought it was hilarious. It's a way of getting the topic out in the open, making fun of it, and then moving past it. 

&gt;  a lot of the places I go to work I get told to get back to my own country 

Maybe you should remind these Brits of their Viking heritage? Suggest they leave with you to ""go back to their own country"". :)


I'm an Australian, living in England, and I get the occasional (constant) taunts due to my slightly different version of English and I often get called a [""convict""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convicts_in_Australia). The irony is that I'm first generation Australian, and my parents fled to Australia from Lithuania after WWII!  On the odd occasion I've told people to lay off, or told them that their joke was getting a bit old and repetitive. 

Maybe it's easier for a man to tell someone to ""fuck off"" in a nice way than it is for a woman to do it.

I live near Cambridge, and work in Cambridge. My office is about 50% ""foreign"", with people from all around the world. 

Cambridge is also full of foreign students. It's a good place to live but houses are very expensive.

Hell, a lot of people even think WW2 was about protecting Jewish people despite the fact that it had nothing to do with the actual war as the majority of it didn't come to light until after Germany was defeated. 

So in this case I completely agree with your theoretical argument but in practice this policy of protecting civil liberties to the hilt has became a policy of suppressing gay rights. Now it wouldn't be an issue if this was done on a egalitarian basis but it isn't, it protects the existing rights of heterosexual couples and Christians at the expense of the right of gay people. 

And I definitely think your argument doesn't work at all as long as the government gives tax breaks. It doesn't matter how tame they are, you can't make a moral/ideological argument and then switch to a practical one when it suits you. 

&gt; one shouldn't need pre- or post-approval for where you want to put your sexual organs.

I agree but you are making an argument against government from on-high and are then dictating what people do and don't need. I think marriage is a silly outdated institution. That doesn't mean I can ignore the people who feel differently, just because I'm not having my rights limited because of my personal feelings and/or orientation doesn't mean other's aren't. 

&gt;(Hey, you might also respond that people who take this stance are simply masking their homophobia, but that kind of cheap, unfalsifiable and bad faith argument style is probably more of the problem than actual fear of homosexuals. My experience is that people who dislike gays are helpfully pretty forthcoming about it.)

Also why did you have to ruin what was overall a good discussion. You argument there is as cheap and unfalsifiable as the one you are attacking! 

And I think you completely miss the point that not everyone thinks everyone against 'gay rights' is a homophobe. You have not said a single homophobic thing, however I think it is easy to make that argument if you aren't affected by it (either because you aren't homosexual or are but don't care about marriage rights).

So overall I see where you are coming from but I think the problem is many of the people making that argument *aren't* equally campaigning ""against"" the existing rights related to marriage. If you are arguing against government intervention it shouldn't be anything to do with ""gay rights"" the issue is government being involved in any marriage. Anyone who focuses, deliberately or by accident, on gay marriage rights exclusively is arguing against gay rights, not against government intervention (at least in any meaningful way because the hypocrisy of such a position is huge).

Which is interesting, given that the photos and videos that can be found [on their website](http://www.gold.ac.uk/) show a diverse culture which is pretty representative of the student body as a whole.

In some ways the largest issue is that the advertisement doesn't necessarily make it obvious that Goldsmiths has a very high proportion of mature (25+) students compared to other universities... but that in part is due to the fact that it has a higher proportion of postgrad students (about 55% iirc)


EDIT - went and found [the actual statistics](http://www.gold.ac.uk/statistics/) for this stuff.

Of the complete student body...

 - **55.6% are undergrads.** This is the reverse of what I said above. I got the numbers back to front. It's still an unusually high proportion so far as I understand. Other universities have more undergrads. [Imperial has 66% undergrads](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/introducing-imperial/facts-and-figures/college-statistics/student-numbers/), [Queen Mary has 73%](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/queen-mary). Cambridge/Oxford normally have around 65-75% undergrads so far as I'm aware, but I couldn't find a similar page quickly when checking.
 - **80.5% are 21 or over at entry** This is *very* unusual. **Even removing postgrads from this - as all of those are over 21 - you still see 66% of the student body entering their degree aged over 21.**
 - **62.2% are white.** Largest other groups are **black african (4.7%), black Caribbean (3.1%) and chinese (4.8%)**. We apparently don't have any gypsies in the college. Did not know that.
 - **Around 19% of the college have a known disability**, of which the largest proportion (8%) have a learning disability such as dyslexia and the second largest (4%) have a mental illness such as schizophrenia, depression or anxiety.",null,0,null,1431456811,null,0,1431466753,0,cr6va83,null,t3_35pykw,null,t1_cr6va83,null,t1_cr6s5ks,null,null,null,1433024487,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

They used an [Exhaustive ballot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaustive_ballot) where the current Conservative MPs vote for one candidate only and the last place candidate is eliminated. This repeats with more ballots until there are only 2 remaining. To select between the final 2 there is a vote with all Conservative party members. In other words completely equivalent to AV (an instant-runoff vote rather than multiple round runoff) except the over 50% rule for winning is ignored (always repeats until only 2 candidates left) and the different electorate for the first rounds and final round at the end. Definitely, absolutely not FPTP which they supported in the 2011 referendum!

Even the labour and lib dem campaigns here for the general election only promised 1000 new doctors, which would still leave us with fewer than England per capita. The education budget has been slashed and the pay for teachers is lower than the rest of the UK, and considering how much lower our PISA rank is than the other UK countries, we need it higher than anyone to catch up. unemployment has fallen slower here than the rest of the country.

Even the councils seem incompetent here; the council tax in Cardiff has gone up 5% (15X higher than inflation) over the course of the current administration, yet Roath library is on the brink of closing down. Budget for other public services such as bin collection and street cleaning and day centers for the elderly have also been slashed.

What happened here is that this company has collapsed to the point where its total market value was about £300K and it needed to raise a ""placing"" of £1.5M to keep going so it wanted to dilute its share base by issuing another 2.7B shares to go along with the current 700M in issue. (That is a massive dilution by the way - bordering on abusive of the existing shareholders.)

The person in the article held 10% (80M shares) before the placing and wanted to maintain the 10% after the placing. Somehow they were sold 342M extra shares even though the placing has not yet been approved at an EGM. That should not be possible. So although the 342M shares have somehow been purchased, they cannot be delivered ('settled') because they do not exist yet.

Someone has to be at the bottom, why is it okay for some people to be at the bottom and not others? If the bottom is too low **fix the minimum wage**

&gt; Also, who says there are plenty of people with adequate qualifications/training who are willing to do these jobs?

If there are not enough people then the wage rises to encourage more people to choose that profession.

&gt; I don't think 12-hour track maintenance shifts are that popular in reality, and they especially won't be if you cut the pay

As above, if not enough people are willing to do it then wages will rise.

&gt; Additionally, how do you train workers looking after safety-critical national infrastructure if you have the worker turnover that's associated with low pay.

This is a safety issue, and is where I said protected striking is appropriate. The strike should be about the safety issue, not the pay, even if the method of fixing it results in higher pay. Ideally (as another commenter said) it wouldn't get as far as this and safety reviews would pick up this problem before it got as far as a strike. It is the job of management to make sure these sorts of issues don't occur.

&gt; would you do your own job for minimum wage

I'm a software developer, given the choice between this job and another minimum wage job in, for example, retail, I would certainly still choose this job.

If the choice was between this job and another sufficiently enjoyable job that paid more then I would of course choose the latter. Other people with the same qualifications as me would do the same thing. As a result of this companies would be unable to find candidates to fill the position and would therefore have to offer a higher salary and.... oh look, we're back where we started!

This is how the job market works, people choose careers based on their qualifications and the remuneration being offered, when there are fewer candidates available than jobs the wages rise as companies compete, this also entices more people into the profession, or to choose an education which leads to it. This will eventually lead to an equilibrium.

When there are more people with a skill set than jobs suited to them then there isn't competition between companies and, more importantly, we don't need more people getting an education for jobs which don't exist. This results in the wages falling and people move towards other professions, until again an equiblium is reached.

This system works, however, now we have one group that are disrupting this by trying to artificially keep wages higher than they should be for one particular industry or company. By doing this you're essentially distrupting the delicate balancing act of the job market, and it's no suprise that the only places people can get away with this are either massive companies, or public sector jobs where competition causes fewer issues.

This also causes massive resentment, these jobs are now being paid more than they should be which means that you have many similarly qualified people chasing well paid jobs in these few protected companies or public services, and the rest having to settle for working in other companies being paid less despite doing the same work. Unequal pay for the same work causes more social problems than everyone being paid the lower amount.

Essentially, this all comes back to this:

Make sure the minimum wage is high enough for anyone on it to have a decent quality of life (our country can afford it, the wealth is there!), then allow the pay for jobs to evolve naturally based on candidates to jobs. That is the fairest method that *actually works* in practice.

Why would you dig coal out of the ground in Yorkshire when you can shit from Australia for half the price? The free market answer is you shouldn't. You focus on your competitive (or comparative) advantage. Simply put we cannot compete on low cost labour costs with China or India.

Tony Blair had it right when he said the future is about ""education education education"" sadly like many PMs he delivered a bunch of half cooked ideas which were not practical in the long term. Increasing the number of students was great, but universities didnt get the funding they needed.

Socialism won the key battles of the 20th century, we have a welfare state and national health in the majority of the western world (even in the USA!) having won those battles it has almost become a redundant ideology since no-one doubts we need them. Many might like the mode of delivery to be different but essentially I think the overwhelming majority of us agree there is a rung below which no one should fall.

That said, the stateism that Labour tried to have in the 80s and 90s is dead, in the Uk i'd be surprised if anywhere near 20% of people wanted a true State/Command economy.  Capitalism has won some battles too.

Why stop banking? Seriously, why kill the goose that lays the golden egg? Sure, I agree our government policies should help other industries and we should invest in the future but banking is a useful service. Very useful in fact.

Change is scary, but by what ""right"" moral or otherwise does someone expect to work in a job for life? Why don't we have more carpenters or coopers? Or gas lighters? Why should some things be protected over others? By regulating for externalities we should allow markets to resolve themselves and support those that are affected by its collapse. Are we going to start keeping accountants in jobs or lawyers when automation removes them? 

Rather than blaming capital and ""the rich"" realise that it is better to help those at the bottom to move to the top rather than trying to take from the top. Enable people to succeed, the government can help that.

We're talking about someone who would play 11 midfielders if he could.

Anyway, mainly due to Puyol's injuries, Masche started filling in at the back.

No. I've never met an estate agent with a whiff of professionalism, at least not the customer-facing ones. 

I've been over-charged both in fees and in deductions from deposits, ignored while seeking legitimate refunds, I've been lied to, they've lied to others about me, they've tried to charge me for things that were broken when I moved in and in the past I've had agents who failed to give us a pass to get into our own building, fail to set up arrangements for utilities despite promising to do so and generally being totally useless once they were paid. The porter at my old building in London went on a rant about how the estate agents never provide any new tenants with what they need before moving in so naturally they go to him to sort it out and he ends up clearing up their mess. 

One estate asked for incredibly personal information from me and my guarantor (while at uni) then got angry at me for not providing character references, proof of education/employment, financial information &amp; forms plus thousands of pounds in deposit and rent within a few days of being aggressively pushed into an offer. She then went on holiday when it came time for us to get the keys and was totally unavailable to help for our first day if we had any problems (which we did have). EDIT: This was Foxtons in central London btw - feel I should warn people. I know it's not always possible as they control the market in London but find a local estate agent and avoid Foxtons like the plague. 

No, once you've signed that contract that's their job over and they stop giving a shit. If they seem nice enough you can always try and talk to the landlord directly and ask them if they would be able to provide a contact without going through the agency (saving you both money). Alternatively you can always just explain that you've had shitty experiences in the past and you won't take it again. Explain what you're going to do and ask them if they have any problem with it. Don't let them pressure you and challenge things if you think they're unnecessary. They have backed down in the past when asking for personal financial information and admitted they only need a payslip or something (which you can black out of any other information that your basic salary as that's likely what they need). If you have any problems tell them you are going to the landlord - they don't give a shit about you but their relationship with the landlord may last years over many tenants and they do care about them so get the landlord on your side and they may be more willing to back down.

At the moment, about 90% of the population use a BBC service (radio or TV) for 40p a day. Arguably the BBC has a massive indirect benefit in terms of the UK's overseas reputation. You simply have to visit countries without a public service broadcaster to see its benefits.

What I feel is completely inexcusable is wanting to remove the ban on using Agency Staff to cover striking workers. This completely removes the teeth from any strikes and pushes the Pendulum too far in the other direction. This is why I am suspicious of the whole process as it is the same with things like political protests etc; they fully support people's right to demonstrate as long as it is quiet, out of the way &amp; doesn't cause too much of a fuss.

There is a reason why everything Cameron does look like it's the product of a PR team. He used to be in charge of an entire PR division at a big company. This is his stuff. Just think back to his time with Brown and Miliband. They never had a chance with him. Unlike Blair who could smell the crap he himself sells.

Unfortunately British society has shown that it likes style and slickness. The biggest complaint I heard from Labour supporters about Ed was that he didn't look like a leader. If Labour wants to get elected they need to make sure their leader can face the media. 

It will be even more important in 2020. Boris might be the Tory leader. I hate this man but so many people love him. The next Labour leader needs to be able to not only fight Boris in England but Sturgoen and Salmon in Scotland and a renewed PD in Wales.

I mean when I look at a teamsheet with Coutinho on the wing I don't hate it but I also don't feel like it's maximizing the player's effectiveness for the team. Lallana I feel *can* play wing but you can kind of tell when a central player is played out wide. They cut in far too often and generally don't provide a lot of width like a true winger does which leaves the fullback out to dry on a counter. A winger with winger instincts might be more likely to take a ball to the line and whip a cross in than a central player who might cut in and shoot more often. That's the real difference I'm talking about with regards to Lallana vs. Markovic or even Sterling and, while I think Lallana can do a job for us on the wing, he isn't the 25m Lallana when he plays there just like Coutinho isn't quite the magician he usually is when played there. I hope that makes sense.

I think the Trams were first started by the Edinburgh council controlled by Labour and then the SNP were outvoted in Holyrood when they tried to stop it years later. It's the sort of project that should never had been put into motion in the first place, but the SNP did not have enough power to effectively argue against it when it was first created.

Animals are slaughtered for meat and other products. Foxes are being slaughtered simply for fun. If you have ever seen (which I can tell you clearly have not) a fox being mauled apart by a pack of dogs I can assure you it is not quick and definitely not humane. You can not care about the suffering of some animals but not others that's just simply nonsensical and contradictory. 

**Snoopers Charter**

So you agree then that governments can not be trusted with our data especially when given free reign and a law to disguise and cover them against repercussions. Some evidence here.

**TTIP**

This is a prime example of what could become common place
http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/03/20/bilcon-seeks-us300m-afte_n_6911412.html?
Also I think you should have a read over the leaked documents on wikileaks yourself. As from a legal standpoint many have shown how the law could be abused. I take it you are not a lawyer so I am more inclined to listen to people who have a good understanding of law.

**Zero Hours**

The way the government portrays it though is as if they have created a huge number of jobs and uses that figure to try and express they are bringing more jobs to the UK, when infact these are very low hour and low paid jobs which don't help people to earn a living wage. They never mention the last part funnily enough. Also I do not have an answer to unemployment as this is only going to get worse due to automation in most industries, this is what capitalism creates and will only get worse. As technology evolves more and more companies will change over to mechanical automation and computer systems instead of human labour as it is simply cheaper and cuts costs, this is what the so called free market demands. Capitalism shoots itself in the foot here basically.

**Food Banks**

You clearly are very uninformed in this area. Demand has been increasing year on year not just the number of food banks to provide for what was already needed. This should get you stared.
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/22/food-bank-users-uk-low-paid-workers-poverty

**Cuts**

So you think cuts to vital life or death services are necessary but spending on illegitimate occupations of foreign countries costing £30 billion is ok? Also systems such as trident which will cost £23.4 billion are a valid use of money when people are suffering and dying.

**Human rights**

Completely nonsensical answer and avoiding the concerns I pointed out about the previous abuse of human right by our governments. Also there is no need whatsoever to replace the current human rights which have been shown time and time to work as I have said previously.

**Fracking**

You are clearly very misinformed in this area also and have a very worrying trust in corporations or what you have been told by them without doing your own independent research. There is so much evidence out there I do not have the time to find and list them all so I have listed some articles below to help you get started. Also just for you here is an article which explains that fracking is no more cleaner than coal. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13053040

No, we should get very angry about it. Because that definition is flawed in many ways. First off, it devalues the main reason why racism, and all forms of prejudice, is bad in the first place; that another person's assumption about you affects your freedom as a human being. This is an intrinsically offensive concept, and affects everyone of all backgrounds.

The definition that this woman, and many others, subscribe to abandons that reasoning. Instead it is replaced with a seemingly vengeful ""historical aggregate"" reasoning, where the actions of a group in the past affects the power of discrimination. The condemnation of racism in her view is not about morals, but retribution.

It is also a very western centric point of view, as this definition of racism is almost always based on European and especially American history, and clumsily applied to racism in other cultures and time periods. It's a very major flaw with this definition, because then what you consider to be discriminatory and offensive depends entirely on your knowledge of history across many cultures.

No, it's much simpler and more fair, to stick to the very basic point of view to stop judging others based on factors they can't control.",null,0,null,1431461549,null,0,false,0,cr6yfjy,null,t3_35pykw,null,t1_cr6yfjy,null,t1_cr6qsbb,null,null,null,1433025969,null,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

I'd like a proper low cost entry level (with a room to grow ability upside) version of Matic as well. Maybe we should be sending a shadow scout around to follow Southampton's scouts. They keep finding gems in midfield.


As for Obiang, I'm a little hesitant to get too worked up about him. I suspect that the vast majority of people on here who are singing his praises have, in actuality, very little knowledge about him beyond what they've seen on youtube or read about on here. I was hesitant about all of our summer signings last year, so I'll be happy if Obiang follows in their foot steps, but until I see him in the flesh for a run of matches, I'm going to be cautiously optimistic about him.


While I'm on the skeptical angle of things, I have a genuine question for people here. Whenever we get linked to a player from another league a lot of people get very worked up about them. I call it the Savio Nsereko syndrome. We're currently linked with Gignac, Beauvue, Obiang, Schar, Mbodj and others this summer, have people genuinely seen these players play much, if at all (Gignac aside), or are they basing their optimism on what they read?


It's looking like Sam's time is finally up. I'm not that keen on Bilic, or at leats not quite yet. If I had to choose from among a heap of mostly unlikable managers (excluding Klopp, I like his personality), I think I'd hope Napoli gets stuffed in the Europa, Rafa loses his job and comes back to England. He knows the league, he occasionally wins trophies, Wenger and Mourinho hate him, and when he gets annoyed his head comedically turns beet red and he spouts nonsensical diatribes. Basically he's a complete twat, but I think he'd be less of a gamble than a McClaren or Bilic. Pie in the sky is still Klopp though.

If he didn't deserve to win in 08/09 (a team that was far more ""inherited"" than the 10/11 was), then it's indicative of the influence he had on his Barcelona teams because they did deserve to win 2 years later. His 10/11 team, the one he had influence upon as opposed to merely inherited - per your logic - performed better as it didn't require some ludicrously poor refereeing to go his way.

Alternatively, if it works better for you logically, envision that Overbo hadn't fucked it and Barca went out. His ""inherited"" team wouldn't have been treble winners and the only treble during his tenure would've been 10/11 whose squad he would have had relatively far more influence upon.

I understand that human rights are important, and it is important that they should not be removed without a mandate from the people, but if we step back from the emotional side of things can we not agree that, at the end of the day, they are still just laws? The Human Rights Act 1998 is the specific act that the Conservatives are trying to repeal - it is just an Act like any other.


&gt; There's no such thing as English citizenship.

To give an example, tuition fees. ""English"" students, i.e. students who live in England, must pay tuition fees to attend Scottish universities while Scottish people don't. So there is already differential treatment for people living in different parts of the country, even though they share the same citizenship.

&gt; What happens if a scottish person is arrested in England?

Ok let's flip that around a second and look at the present day example of the drink drive limit. It is lower in Scotland, and if an English (or any other ""nationality"") person was arrested in Scotland while over the limit, yet would have been under the rUK limit, they'll still be prosecuted.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is this; surely you'll just have the rights that the law of the country you are in gives you? It's not like if you go to Thailand you still have the right to Freedom of Expression - you'd still be able to commit Lèse majesté and be punished for it. In the hypothetical situation that Scotland retained ECHR, and the British Bill of Rights did not include the right to privacy (for arguments sake), then while you are in Scotland you would have this right, and while you are in E&amp;W you would not? Less than ideal, but I don't think it's unworkable.

null,false,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; To give an example, tuition fees. ""English"" students, i.e. students who live in England, must pay tuition fees to attend Scottish universities while Scottish people don't. So there is already differential treatment for people living in different parts of the country, even though they share the same citizenship.

This is not a comparison. Tuition fees are not human rights, they're not comparable. Tuition fee's are not even a 'law' or something applied onto all people. They're voluntary payments made to universities using loans from the government. I don't see why you're trying to make this comparison to be honest.

&gt;Ok let's flip that around a second and look at the present day example of the drink drive limit. It is lower in Scotland, and if an English (or any other ""nationality"") person was arrested in Scotland while over the limit, yet would have been under the rUK limit, they'll still be prosecuted.

Again a drink drive law is not a human right that is applied to all citizens. Different countries have different laws because they have different jurisdictions, there are no variations on 'jurisdictions' of human rights because human rights in the UK are applied equally to all UK citizens, that's how human rights work in law, human rights are not applied by location they are applied by citizenship, of which everyone in the UK is a UK citizen. This is why it would create a constitutional crisis because you would have to create separate citizenships to apply different rights to them.


&gt;I suppose what I'm trying to say is this; surely you'll just have the rights that the law of the country you are in gives you? It's not like if you go to Thailand you still have the right to Freedom of Expression - you'd still be able to commit Lèse majesté and be punished for it.

No, because that is the Thailand Government prosecuting someone of a different nationality. If someone is arrested in Scotland it would be the UK government prosecuting a UK citizen, who has the rights afforded to them by the United Kingdom, except there will now be two or three different rights afforded to UK citizens with no way to differentiate them. A UK citizen is a UK citizen, there is no difference between citizens in the United Kingdom, that's how the UK works and functions. Your examples are all based on residency, not citizenship. There is no such thin as a Scottish citizen or an English citizen. Someone from England and Scotland are treated as equal under the law as they are both UK citizens and are treated as such, this change requires there to be a split in UK citizenship into two tiers, aka removing UK citizenship altogether and replacing it with two separate citizenships. Our legal framework does not allow it and would require a creation of two different legal systems applying to two different citizenships within the same country.",null,0,null,1431463049,null,0,false,0,cr6zfbz,null,t3_35os09,null,t1_cr6zfbz,null,t1_cr6z4l3,null,null,null,1433026439,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Out of interest, can anyone tell me how many people the panel consists of &amp; who is on the panel. I've been digging for ages and the only confirmed person I can find is Kevin Phillips who talked about  it on Talksport radio this week. 

I might be buying into the whole Chelsea conspiracy theory but Kevin Phillips is a first team coach at Leicester.

Nigel Pearson (Leicester manager) won MotM for April after beating Burnley, Swansea, West Brom &amp; West Ham yet losing to Chelsea (12 points).

Jose beat Leicester, Man Utd, QPR, Stoke &amp; drew away to Arsenal (13 points).

I suppose you can say Jose has the better resources in playing staff but can you seriously say the MotM is someone who lost to another manager who also went unbeaten against tougher opposition?

So how do you become one? You fight and scratch slowly to build your reputation. That means playing Europa League every year and doing consistently well and maybe making deep runs, and making runs in cups, and coming in 5-7 almost every year until more people know who you are and you gain fans internationally and you sell more merchandise and make more money and more players know who you are and think you're a big club and so maybe you can sign young potential superstars and then maybe one of those superstars becomes a star and stays with you for a few years, which helps build your reputation even more so more young potential stars sign when that one leaves and you can make more money while playing Europa and finishing 5-7, and then maybe you can afford a stadium, and then maybe you can get sponsors to pay more, and so on and so on.

It's a long, long road to being a regular CL club and it's one that's always at risk of falling apart. But there isn't a magic solution. We just have to keep building--by which I mean doing exactly what we are doing, because we've been on this road for a while.
