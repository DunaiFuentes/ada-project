We both agree that we want less people dependent on welfare. There are two solutions to this. 

First, there is the trickle down theory, this is the conservative mantra. Give more money to the rich through tax cuts and they will invest that extra money in new jobs for the lower classes, reducing unemployment. There are countless economic experts who have refuted this theory.

The other solution is giving tax cuts to the poor and increasing minimum wage, trickle up economics. The poor have more money to spend on luxury products, such as a house deposit, new car, TV, luxury foods etc etc putting more money into firms and in turn more money into government revenue through VAT and corporate tax. This method works. This is what labour should be endorsing.

You **seriously** believe that an £8 minimum wage is too left wing? Considering that is the living wage, it should be a conservative policy, offering the bare minimum for comfortable human survival without luxury.

You have not made one coherent argument as to why miliband was left wing (which he wasn't), I'm interested to know why you think that.",null,0,null,1432405545,null,0,false,0,crilyio,null,t3_36uoho,null,t1_crilyio,null,t1_cridvnb,null,null,null,1433227320,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

Can I have your opinions on the ability of Volland and the likelihood of Otamendi...I really like Volland.He could be class given the chance at striker but he has been pushed out to the right by Gizdol.

I know Kova and Nain are totally different players but depending on Lucas I would like one of them.

Gunter is a cheap attacking rotation option for LB.
Trippier/Montoya are to bolster the RB spot.

Out:
All strikers except Studge,(maybe)Lucas,Sterling(if a 40-50 million bid comes in from a FOREIGN club),Johnson and Enrique

All pretty generic outs

Edit:either these are kinda obscure or I forgot them...

Well we don't really know how it was phrased. We have a rough, shortened description of what I assume was a longer conversation and the details do rather matter here.

&gt; they company will have to register using the sub-contractors and pay them proper wages

Doesn't that depend heavily how the contracts are worded? You can't pay them by the hour and control how they do the work and call them contractors but if they're a company fulfilling a contract and have more freedom then they're not employees of yours. IR35 and all that jazz.

&gt; but offering it up front is just stupid.

Where does it say it was offered up front? Remember, this is a short account of a conversation with little context. They've settled on a firm and are into the ""nitty gritty of contracts"", all it'd really take is a ""hmm, that's more than we were expecting, can you do it any cheaper?"" in there that we don't know about. Despite that, offering an option that's cheaper to the customer but identical to the seller (in terms of actual profit) is something you might want to do to get everything signed and agreed upon. 

&gt; So it sounds like they're going to be putting materials through the books and labour is being paid under the table which is avoidance.

While this could well be the case, it's worth OP clarifying what they mean. If it's just a misunderstanding and we convince them to drop out of an otherwise fine deal and tell others that the firm is dodgy, then I think that's going rather too far.

I remember in around December ish there was an article made by one of the journalists (I think Pearce) which was essentially written by Rodgers trying to save face by blaming the workings of the Committee. I know and we all know that the committee are not on the same page with the manager. And as you quite rightly mentioned, when things become strained then it leads on to bad decisions. Klopp trusts Zorc and Watzke, and so when there is disagreement, each person acknowledges that there must be something about the guy that makes the other 2 agree on purchasing him. But Ayre? Fallows? Gordon? What do they know about how Rodgers wants to play? Do we really need 6 people to come in agreement to buy someone?

A firm we often partner with in the South is rebuilding a bridge because the city elected an all Tea Party City Council that refused to budget for flood control because they were in a drought, which is the most important time to prepare for floods as dry ground does not absorb for shit.  

Come spring, a week of heavy rain partially exposes both the abutments on either end of the bridge along with the rest of the foundation.  No one had cleaned out the culverts since Obama had been elected.  They keep driving on it, and then the substructure starts failing.  Finally someone has sense to call the State.  State comes out and shuts bridge down.  Town freaks out that they will have to drive 5 miles further up to cross now.  

Cost of maintaining flood control prevention: 100k or so a year to keep 2 people on payroll.  Cost for their new bridge 3 million, with the added bonus that this has a very good chance of raising the insurance rates for the town in the future.  Why?  Because through inaction on their part they made the area they govern into a high risk flood zone.  It takes decades to build out good flood control and only a few years of ignoring it to make it all but useless.

Amazon are trying to pre-emptively avoid being hit by the new diverted profits tax because it would massively increase their tax liability. It remains to be seen whether they will actually end up paying more corporation tax than they did previously. We will have to wait to see what profits Amazon UK declares to the taxman next year. 

Their revenue will increase because they are now declaring their UK sales to the taxman, the question is how much will they cook their expenditure to try to minimize the tax they have to pay in the UK. They might end up still paying nothing due to creative accounting. 

Amazon is never going to ""decide"" to pay more tax. Businesses pay tax because they legally have to, not because they feel a desire to give millions to the government. Amazon probably spends millions a year minimizing its tax liability, as do all big companies. Amazon will pay the bare minimum in tax that it legally can.

When Rodgers took over, the club didn't regress, we stayed about where we were in terms of league position but showed signs that we were improving. Then last season happened. It was a complete anomaly, you're right. But your interpretation of it is devoid of all logic. It shouldn't be used to support an indictment of Rodgers, it should be seen as an impressive season from a good manager to beat the trend. We pay 5th most in wages in the league, our squad is about the 5th best, and we will likely finish around where we should. Given certain inhibitory factors like losing Suarez and Sturridge, a poor transfer window (short term, at least), and given what I have said about our relative quality, I think this season has been completely acceptable, within the context of where we are as a football club. Am I happy that we are where we are? No. But do I have enough about me to realize there is more to it than just blaming our manager? Yes. People seem to want an easy fix, and think sacking the manager will give us that, but the sad reality is that we are not a 4th place outfit.

Ayre said: ""We have a head of analysis, a head of recruitment, a first-team manager, myself. All of those people are all inputting into a process that delivers what a director of football would deliver.”

Of course she was wrong to announce it like that, but in the UK suicide on train tracks is very common. Rail staff become desensitised to it and it just becomes another (still tragic) inconvenience on a long list of factors that delay trains.

 My dad has known several colleagues quit the job and be traumatised for many years due to someone stepping in front of their train. I can't imagine what it must be like to see someone step in front of your train, knowing full well you won't stop in time even if you put the emergency brakes on. All you can do is sound your horn and hope they move and prepare yourself for the inevitable. It's messed up. 

It doesn't make it any less tragic or right of the announcer, but if staff they don't become desensitised to suicides on the tracks then they wouldn't be able to stay in the job very long.

I think this is a major problem for the party - they talk about long term goals and visions for the country in a way that no other party does and then come election time people compare the greens long term visions with the other parties short term policies and brand the Greens as looney. This is annoying because for the other 59 months of the year outside of elections people will complain non-stop about how short sighted the politicians in power are....

Isn't every immigrant effectively able to get close to £6k in benefits already (JSA / housing / personal allowance / child benefit / child tax credit)? 

It can be possible to get rid of the £10k tax free allowance (saving £2k per person earning over £10k), scrap most other benefits and the admin required to administer them and slightly raise taxes to try and mitigate the cost of a lowish £5-10k allowance. 

That way, even if you were unemployed, temporary, zero-hours, or trying to start a business you could still have a safety net to rely on, without having to beg the DWP not to sanction you. 

But every time basic income comes up in an article like this, it seems to only talk about the costs and not the savings and improvement to equality it could bring, eg 50,000,000 people * £6k/pa = £300Bn/pa is too expensive.

As for Darlow and Lacelles I thought that neither of them were any where near as good as they were in the 2013/14 season and think de vries will be a good replacement as he proved mid-season. It will be difficult with the embargo but if we can sign some 'hungry' young footballers from league 1 and 2 then I think that will be ok.

DUP lost South Antrim to an unapolagetic gay marriage supporting unionist.

DUP also lost top unionist status in mid ulster at the GE after ridiculous anti-gay pronouncements by a local DUP cllr during the campaign.

DUPs have an evangelical core (though alot of it has now been lost to the TUV) but are hugely reliant in their top dog unionist status on branching out to a more moderate unionist vote that used to be UUP, especially in greater Belfast.

They're more scared of losing the moderate vote than you might imagine.

Hence the continuing shuffling of their top team towards the centre.

If Villa end up towards, or dare I say it, at the top of the table, we may find players will want to actually start to come and play for Villa. For years now, they have been a mid-bottom table team. Scraping by and ultimately training up younger players only to have them migrate to better teams. I don't want to seem overly optimistic, but regardless of how cocky he may seem, Sherwood seems really positive regarding Villa and it looks like he is pushing them to be better... and it's working.

null,false,IanCal,null,null,null,"Thanks for the extra info, I didn't mean it as a complaint about your question by the way! Just that I didn't think we could definitively say it's breaking certain rules.

While I can see a way it might be legit, the only case I can see is if the amount you gave to the builders would be pretty much exactly half of the before VAT price, and even then only if the builders aren't VAT registered. As I say, you can't charge customers VAT if you're not VAT registered, but you *must* if you are. If the builders take less than 80k/year and mostly deal directly to customers rather than businesses then it makes sense for them to not be registered (since they can quote cheaper prices).

The final bit is that how much VAT you pay should have nothing to do with the mechanism of payment, although some people prefer cash as it's easier for what they need. 

The other possible setup is that the main company isn't VAT registered and they're just adding on a whack of cash and keeping it. That's not good.

Whatever you do, you should get a receipt for all money paid, and on any that you're paying VAT on you should have a VAT number. Companies should have no problem handing over their VAT number (it's probably on a lot of correspondence, there's nothing secret about it) and you can check the VAT number here: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vieshome.do

Rambling over, if it might be ok IF for a total pre-tax cost of X:

* You get a receipt from the builders for (X / 2) specifying no VAT
* You get a receipt from the main company for (X / 2) + 20% VAT

I can't think of another way that could be OK. Again, not an accountant though.",null,0,null,1432415328,null,0,false,0,criqgnw,null,t3_36wp2i,null,t1_criqgnw,null,t1_crimzak,null,null,null,1433229443,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Reading a long post that begins with this makes me feel as if I'm being sold something.

&gt; I'm an entrepreneur and I'm continuously thinking of cool things we can do to make our world better.

This makes you sound like a twat.  I get that you're just explaining where you're coming from, but it's not really necessary to say this.

&gt; Rather like the ALS ice bucket challenge, lets create a short selfie video thanking Steven for his incredible contribution to our club, nominate other Liverpool fans to do the same, and donate to the SGF

This idea isn't really anything nearly as ""viral"" as the ice bucket challenge, so I'm not sure why you compared it to that.  Maybe people are put off by that.

Ailing Reds plan to strike for Aston Villa forward whose goals helped Tim Sherwood's men beat the drop this season

By Jonathan Northcroft 

LIVERPOOL are plotting a recruitment drive, spearheaded by the £30m capture of Christian Benteke, that they hope will enable them to make up ground at the top of the Premier League — and help persuade Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract. James Milner, Danny Ings and Fiorentina’s Brazilian goalkeeper, Neto, are other primary targets as Brendan Rodgers seeks proven talent to enhance his squad.

I agree. However, I do feel as if giving the public the power to leave is both good and bad. I feel that scaremongering in the media will lead a majority of people to vote to leave the EU, without actually understanding the ramifications of their actions.

To me, economists and SOME politicians (albeit it few it would seem) know more about the EU and it's many intricacies etc, and thus maybe a referendum is not the best. But I do simultaneously see the possibility of a referendum as some sort of  democratic success. Although that in itself is not representative, as not everyone will vote, and many people will vote to not leave.

As well as this, 16 year olds have the responsibilities to pay pay adult fares for services, leave full time education and leave legal parental/guardian responsibility - they can even get married, pay taxes and start their own family. If they get these responsibilities, surely they should also get the rights which come alongside them? This decision affects the future of millions of young people, so it's only fair they get a say in it.",null,0,null,1432417710,null,0,false,0,crirk37,null,t3_370fl5,null,t1_crirk37,null,t1_crir6gk,null,null,null,1433229959,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

I'm not at all insensitive to the idea that the EU, by definition, is not a very democratic institution. This argument used to be as much an argument of the left (Tony Benn, Neil Kinnock etc) as it was of the right, and generally, the opposition to the EU has come from principled, democratic politicians. It is only in recent years that opposition to the EU has become dominated by the immigration question.

But I also think we have to take seriously the benefits of the EU project, where trade and people cross borders with ease. Its easy to forget that Europe used to be as volatile as the middle east. 

I think we also need to consider the benefits, on balance, of wealthier countries subsidising poorer countries, because asymmetrical financial crises too have been an historic cause of mayhem.

Because we're a much better option than basket cases like Spain and France.

It's a tricky one.  I'm not happy at paying an eight figure sum every single day (Lord knows what we could do domestically with that money) just to be talked at by some cretin in Brussels nobody here has voted for, I'm not happy with the UK being continually lambasted and told what to do while other countries like Belgium and Greece raise their middle fingers then pick and choose what rules they decide to follow.

I would go for root and branch EU reform first of all, heading back some way towards the original Common Market that people voted for back in the 70s.  We can ditch the centralised control, ditch idiocy like the Euro, ditch unhindered immigration and allow some sovereign control (why are we letting in hardened criminals just because they're Polish?

You make a few good points, but let's address all of them individually: 

 &gt; * Stevie has been leading the club on the pitch for 12 years. 

Yes. Good point. But it doesn't necessarily mean he will make for a good manager. 

&gt; * Stevie is a better man manager. He is well known and respected around the world. He has the respect of just about all who's played with him. 

Better than who? Rodgers? McCoist? It's possible for players to respect a former player for who they were as a player, but not as a manager. See: McCoist. Let's not forget that Stevie will no longer be playing if and when he becomes a manager. 

&gt; *  Stevie has the football aptitude to play any position on the pitch. During his prime he could do anything needed on the pitch. This means a frightful understanding of the strategy of the game. Both he and Carra study the game constantly. 

His versatility as a player would help in management, for sure. Good point.

&gt; * Stevie doesn't have his medal, yet. The thing I love most in the world is knowing that Stevie doesn't see this as job done. He has unfinished business here, and I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't rest until he's completed his collection. 

He would certainly want that monkey (kind of) off his back. But as we have seen through his playing career, it takes more than really, really, really wanting it to win the league. 

I think Gerrard has the potential to be a great manager one say. But I think we all need to exercise a bit of caution and not assume he will be successful if he's just thrown into the position with no experience.

The argument the DUP have to make for a peitition of concern is not 'do most people reject this' it is 'does this negatively affect the community we designate as'. Even if 60-70% of the population said yes, the DUP would just turn around and say ""This will still affect the majority of Unionists, therefore we reject it""

Also, the referendum is basically of the form 'Should x people have y rights', which I think is a very dangerous precedent. Do we have to have another referendum every time some group want certian rights, e.g. women and abortion?

The referendum down south was not of this form - the decision was made already, political will was there, it had a mandate from the people - all that was needed was the consent via referendum to change the constitution (which had to be done because Marriage is mentioned in it).

The reason is essentially payrolls.

At the moment, we tax companies relatively lightly and trust that they'll use the profits they generate to stimulate the economy. By and large they do: there are many jobs, people are reasonably well paid, even though the very top of the pile are arguably awarding themselves much more of the cake than they deserve.

To pay for a Basic Income, you need much more tax revenue, and you have to get it from companies. If you push taxes absurdly high to fund this, companies make no money and either close down, shed employees or make so little money they can't invest and the economy will stagnate. That means no money for anything new or improved, we're stuck.

The only way you can pay for a Basic Income is when companies can be taxed very highly, and they can only be taxed very highly when their profit margins are massive. In other words, when most companies can make billions using a tiny workforce, all but eliminating their operating costs. In other words, when the economy becomes automated.

In a world where almost all companies have almost no payroll expenses, almost no office expenses, almost no staff-related expenses at all, and where the overwhelming majority of their profit-making labour comes from unpaid robots, it's entirely reasonable to tax them at 70-80%, because their 20% profit only has to pay a small number of people. 

Don't get me wrong, inequality is going to skyrocket here. Owners of these companies will pay themselves millions because they can: there's almost no-one else to pay after all.

That 80% will go to a Basic Income, though, because unemployment will be almost as universal as this universal income will be. ",null,0,null,1432419850,null,0,false,0,crisjgj,null,t3_370i2o,null,t1_crisjgj,null,t3_370i2o,null,null,null,1433230511,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

* Getting a referendum on the EU, a direct say, is incredibly rare, the last referendum on the EU was in 1975 so everyone 57 and younger has never had the opportunity to directly vote on whether to be in the EU or not. Based on past evidence it's likely that this referendum will be the only one in our lifetimes where we have a chance to vote directly on this issue.

* Since 1975 there have been 5 treaties passed by various governments, none of them had referendums. If you consider a fundamental principle of democracy that one parliament can do another can undo then these treaties are deeply suspect, when a treaty is passed a democratically elected subsequent government can do nothing to alter the content of the previously passed treaty. So in a fundamental way the EU and its treaties are significantly different than the normal workings of government because they transfer power away from the UK government to the EU where to all intends and purposes that power is no longer subject to your democratic vote.

* Arguably the greatest EU project since the single market, the Euro has been to large parts of europe a disaster. It may not have *caused* the troubles those countries are in but it most certainly has hampered their recoveries terribly. It's amazing to me that people are so pro-EU but can somehow ignore or excuse the terrible hardships that particular EU project has inflicted on its citizens.

* I believe the most important question in this referendum is not what the EU is now, but what it will be in 20 or 30 years time. Because again, the chances of you getting another referendum are by past evidence incredily slim, so the question is, what it the plan for the EU, what will it become? I feel that is a much more important question to ask, if nobody can answer it to your satisfation I would be deeply suspicious of continuing to *transfer power to an organisation which cannot articulate its end form*.

They've also taken issue with her in the past for saying that children's courts should be private and have dug up the fact than an Ofsted inspection once found that some of the services in her county were inadequate and used all this to paint her as a ""controversial figure"" and then let people like yourself make the jump to concluding that she has stepped down because of these controversies.

Single payer health systems tend to use a combination of direct (GPs as gatekeepers to prevent unneeded expensive treatments) and indirect (waiting lists and waiting times) rationing to reduce the cost of health care. 

The NHS is really good at incentivising doctors to prescribe mostly generic rather than branded drugs wherever possible. I think we have something like 80 percent generic prescriptions now? 

Finally we have this excellent group called the national institute for clinical and healthcare excellence (NICE), who determine whether treatments are cost-effective enough (in terms of cost/benefit) for the NHS  to consider using . They consider the opportunity cost of approving a new treatment by comparing outputs with a ""cost effectiveness threshold"" value.

As for wages, the fact that he is a Bosman means that we can boost his wages pretty hard for the first years. Just think if he had been a 10 million signing on a 4 year contract that means we could boost his wages with 200k a month and still break even meaning we could quite probably meet his demands pretty easily.

So knowing that the last thing he wants to do is warm the bench I doubt he will go to a massive club, and we are def in that pool behind the best of the best.

Firstly, for £360 this bike would be a rip off, for £160 its ok. 

People get snobby about components, but the fact is a well set up set of derailleurs will shift well no matter where they sit on the Shimano hierarchy.

The problem is...well set up, halfords are terrible at building their bikes, they come to the shop partially built and the snotty nosed kid behind the counter sets them up. This usually means poor shifting and poor braking.

The front suspension is just to look pretty, it'll probably be more annoying than anything.

Disc brakes at this level generally offer no better braking than v-brakes, although they will perform better in the wet. 

17kg is heavy but its not *that* heavy, I commute on a 15kg steel framed bike, its perfectly fine, I imagine a lot of the weight in this case comes from the fork.

You don't say what you're going to use the bike for? If its for fun day rides on-road or on bike paths/bridleways I would strongly recommend the Edinburgh bike co-op trail finder ([link](http://www.edinburghbicycle.com/products/revolution-trailfinder?bct=browse%2fbicycles%2fcommuter-hybrid-bikes)), I used to have one, and I know three people who have one and we've all raved about this bike, and for a no nonsense bike that's good value and will last for years its an excellent choice. much much better than the apollo bike you linked. 

The apollo prioritises things like disc brakes and suspension which at this price point are needless extra weight just there to look flash. Problem is, its not fooling anyone.

From an economic perspective, if lots of people voted to leave - even if the majority voted to stay - then we would see less investment from Europe. If we did leave, then our economy would be fucked, at least in the short term (a few years).


Would leaving actually improve our country? No way. 
We would lose huge amounts of trade, workers, students, political power, trade/economic power (we'd be a smaller market), as well as being able to move freely within an entire continent. Then also the poorest, most deprived parts of the country would lose billions worth of investments.

My favourite for burgers and chips is Free State Kitchen off hardman street. Tiny restaurant with a big garden in the back. Personally think it's the best burgers in the city. Nothing absolutely massive either. 

If you want something ridiculous, Almost famous does stupidly stacked burgers. 

I've never been but all my friends seemed to enjoy it, but there's the death row diner so if your kids are going through the phase where everything is slightly morbid or whatever, that could be the place. It's meant to be based off last meals!

For something smaller but fun there's Bakchich on bold street. Lebanese food, can't really go wrong. 

And there's Eds diner I think it's called on lord street maybe? By CEX and Home and Bargain. got the whole 50s retro thing going for it. Foods quite good too, and priced as such where you know you're in a restaurant but you're not paying out the arse entirely.

It's one that is incredibly difficult to break free from because it's an addiction to a form of self obsession. This can be caused by horrific experience like violence, neglect and sexual abuse. But that self obsession is selfish in the true sense of the word. All that person's attention is on themselves and their suffering. I have compassion for it whilst still seeing the selfishness it implies. The best treatment for depression is people finding something worthwhile to do that provides a service to others. Of course that can be a very long road but I don't think we serve depression by either colluding with the two extremes of I'm a worthless person or no one understands what I've been through. Both are lies. Killing yourself is an act of selfishness. It's an act of violence directed at yourself, God and the world. There is no love or compassion in an act like that. For you or anyone else. Lack of compassion is synonymous with selfishness. Being negatively self obsessed does not mean that we should lack compassion back though it is a disease or an addiction caused by very difficult life circumstances.

Kindly fuck off with this, please. This smear that anyone who disagrees with you internally within the Party is secretly a Conservative voter is absurd and entirely dishonest. Further, whilst I'm politically literate and know exactly why I am a member of the Labour Party, how on Earth do you think you're going to be part of the team which gains a Parliamentary majority when every time you meet someone you disagree with you sneer at them and ask them whether they should vote for the other Party.

&gt;You seriously believe that an £8 minimum wage is too left wing?

I *know* that the minimum wage is a ~~bad~~ inferior policy and that we would do better to finance redistribution by the State through tax credits and other fiscal transfers, rather than privatizing it to be done by companies. If you actually asked any economist about the minimum wage they'd explain it's a bad policy, not because it necessarily causes job losses (it doesn't) but because it's incredibly inefficient at doing what it's supposed to do (raising the living standards of the poor).

&gt;You have not made one coherent argument as to why miliband was left wing (which he wasn't)

Oh *come on*.

&gt;I'm interested to know why you think that.

The entire strategy of the Labour Party in 2015 was based on the assumption that Britain had moved to the Left, beyond New Labour, and that Labour could position itself Left-wing enough to scoop up a majority out of 35% of the vote.

Because the British electorate rejected Labour's most left-wing platform since 1983 by a stonking defeat. There are no more votes to pick up by moving further left.

&gt;I would say that he could have been much, much more left-wing, but that wasn't the single thing that lost us the election, and I doubt anyone really thinks it is.

Sure, it wasn't the only thing which cost us the election, the other major things being Miliband's leadership and the SNP, but it was the thing Miliband could do the most to change.

Whilst completely ignoring the solutions to better standards of living for the poor, your interpretation of the minimum wage can only be akin to Friedman and the free market bandwagon. I'd really like an explanation to that, if you have time.

People working on minimum wage right now would be payed less if minimum wage didn't exist. The whole point for maximum return on 'unskilled' jobs for firms is to pay them as little as you can whilst keeping them in your employ. Are you saying that removal of the minimum wage will allow firms to distribute the money better by giving more to some and less to others? It doesn't make any sense.

If you really believe that the free market (no minimum wage) can allocate wages maximizing welfare then you're arguably more right than the Tories, factually. I don't mean that as a slander or anything, I'm being genuine. If Cameron proposed to abolish the minimum wage he could expect a good 75% of his backbenchers defect instantly.


&gt; The entire strategy of the Labour Party in 2015 was based on the assumption that Britain had moved to the Left, beyond New Labour, and that Labour could position itself Left-wing enough to scoop up a majority out of 35% of the vote. It was clearly a Left wing manifesto and campaign.

You're right, but can you give me one left wing policy they had? I doubt it, because they don't have any.

So for example in 2013, 316,000 British citizens were living in Spain, 113,000 British citizens in Ireland, 41,000 in the Netherlands, 15,000 in Denmark and 3000 in Bulgaria. The UK isn't in the top 5 for any other member states.

But there's a difference between the country of birth of people and their citizenship: a good example is Slovakia. 4000 people in Slovakia in 2013 were born in the UK, but the number of British citizens there is far lower, suggesting that many of this 4000 are the children of Slovakian migrants who returned home from the UK. Equally Bulgaria shows a fairly high number of British citizens, but the number of people actually born in the UK is lower which points towards Bulgarians who acquired British citizenship and returned to Bulgaria, which is backed up by data in the 2011 Bulgarian census and the OECD. Then Ireland has like a 100,000 difference between citizenship and place of birth.

Hitler sees you and says ""Hey. I need to get out of here and I'm happy to free you too! I have the key to the door, lets go before the gas switches on!""

You are next to a lever marked ""gas release"". You know that pulling it will flood the chamber with gas. You will die, but so will the man that committed all those atrocities, and will continue to commit more if you let him save you both.

For Interaction Design, I've got 4 ~150 page books to read through, written by the OU team with readings and exercises, plus a ~1000 page set text. These are accompanied by a DVD with computer based activities and videos.

Each of the 4 books covers a ""block"" and covers about 6 weeks of work, finishing with a Tutor Marked Assignment. This consists of a few questions forming a project. For reference, my most recent TMA was about 4000 words.

There are also online forums to chat with other students and ask for help or discuss the course. They also do tutorials via a kinda skype service that they run. Some courses do face to face tutorials too, but none of mine have really.

The courses I've done/am doing end with an exam. These are held at a local centre, mine is in the function room of a hotel near where I like, I suspect others are similar venues. These are just like the exams you took at school, only with older people in there.

Was it? Coz while that was something worth doing, I see there being two other priorities as well:

1. Replace Suarez

2. Add depth to a woefully small squad that now had to compete in Europe as well

So we added depth, but we didn't replace Suarez. It's bizarre that you blame Rodgers for that when it's established now that the committee, after missing out on Sanchez and Remy, came to Rodgers in the middle of August and said ""well, Brendan, there's two options left - Eto'o or Balotelli. Best of luck!""

Did he get the most out of Balotelli? Definitely no, and slate him for that if you want.

As for defensive improvement - aren't we very much close to winning the golden glove? What's that if not defensive improvement? Aren't we potentially going to finish 5th despite losing ~50 goals due to Suarez leaving and Sturridge's injuries?

Most of the work is focused around the skills common to these disciplines: close reading/looking/listening, contextualising sources, constructing an argument, etc. There are seven TMAs but they're quite short, ranging from 750 to 1500 words, and a 2000 word EMA worth half of the final result. Like any university, you only need to get a 40% pass mark at level one, but other boundaries are higher: 55% for a 2:2, 70% only gets you a 2:1, you need 85% for a first.

At level one the work is quite a bit easier, but later levels are more comparable to a campus university. You don't need any prior qualifications to study at undergraduate level with the OU, so a lot of level one is getting you up to speed. Each section builds on the one before, so while anybody with an interest could do chapter one of the first book, the final chapter of the fourth book is much more difficult. The learning curve is fairly steep, but very manageable and IMO the material is presented very well.

The actual work is four books, each with one chapter to be studied each week. There is also some supplementary material on CD, DVD, and DVD-ROM, and a few online activities. If you want to be left entirely to your own devices, you can be, but you'll be assigned a tutor if you need help. Contact is usually by phone or email, and it's left up to you to make the first move; one of my coursemates rang her tutor quite a lot (she has dyslexia and dispraxia), but I've only sent a couple of emails requesting clarification for my TMAs. I highly recommend also attending any tutorials or day schools on offer as they are a great opportunity to meet and discuss with other students as well as your tutor. There's also a tutor group forum you can use. For general queries and assistance, there are various helpdesk numbers (IT, library, fees and funding, etc.). So there's lots of help available if you ask for it.

null,false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,null,"Agreed on the last part. There is always risk in anything, always, from making a sandwich to building a nuclear power plant. The question is can that be lowered to an acceptable (I.e. extremely low) level. In this case I know neither the specific geological issues involved nor the contingencies put in place by third energy. I do know that in cuadrillas case they were double and sometimes even triple lining their wells so as to reduce risk to an extremely low degree, and wouldn't be surprised if we see similar from third.

I know you feel I'm biased and of course I am, as are you in your own way, but that doesn't change the fact that onshore drilling is going to increase more than likely, and that's also likely to include a significant amount of hydraulic fracturing. I would like this to be done in a safe and responsible manner, which is how things are done offshore under the DECCs framework, and I believe this is perfectly possible.

There are a great  deal of big advantages for the country, and so long as we continue with the same safety measures which have been used for decades both on and offshore, risk will be well managed and mitigated.

null,false,Bosola,null,null,null,"I was once stranded in Croydon at 3am on a Sunday morning. It must have been exactly a year ago. 

I'd been to a party in South East London. Blackheath or somewhere. For reasons unremembered, I'd rushed out of the party at about 1am, trying to get the bus to Tottenham Court Road so I could have a fairly simple trip back to East London on the trusty N8. I knew the number of the bus I wanted and I saw one travelling on the North-facing side of the road.

I was drunk and knackered and distracted and drunk. I wasn't paying too much attention as we snaked around the suburbs. But I had a bit of a jolt as we suddenly stopped.

Some filthy spiv had thrown up on an innocent woman on the lower floor, and the bus had been stopped to get a replacement. We all had to get off in a surprisingly chilly night for May because health and safe- yeah, you know. There was wailing, complaining and shivering. The woman was crying and rushed off somewhere. I think the spiv just slunk off somewhere under the baleful gaze of everyone. Honestly, I just wanted the misty warmth of an upstairs seat and the slim possibility of being able to get home without having to sit next anyone too weird.

About half an hour later a replacement arrived, miraculously. Like a shining torch of hope! Well, I probably felt less generously like that at the time, but it was a welcome development. I cosied myself in an upstairs seat and fell into the warm fuzz of semi-sleep you can only really indulge on a long ride with public transport.

About twenty minutes later, I started to become troubled. I didn't recognise any of the stops. I started to sit upright. I needed to check this. So I pulled put my piece of shit phone and spent a further five minutes trying to get a data connection. Finally, the screen was loading when the announcer chimed in: Next station, Croydon South. Shit.

I jumped off in the middle of nowhere and weighed up my options. It was now 2.45am. I could either try and get the next bus back (and get in around 4) or find a Travelodge. I knew there was one close by now my phone had finally kicked into action. Surely there would be capacity - Travelodge is used by businessmen in the week, barely ever at the weekends somewhere like Croydon. As the return bus screamed past me, I knew I was committed. So I walked through the surreal landscape of car parks and concrete to find the solitary glow of an intercom. I buzzed and hoped for the best.

It was fully booked. Fully booked! How?! Who the fuck goes on holiday to Croydon at the weekend? Who could possibly have reason to be there, on leisure, at that time? 

Anyway, eventually I managed to get the bus back, albeit one less peaceful than the former, being as it was boarded by a young fellow named ""Matty"" who insisted on using his smudgy overdriven phone speakers to repeatedly play a five-second RnB snippet in an apparently vain attempt to get attention from his lopsided-looking friends. The more they ignored him, the more he played it. He looked like a JPEG of a teenager rescaled to the wrong aspect ratio and, reader, I hated him. Then I got off at Holborn and had to dodge pedalos - like Frogger - and stay away from a couple of roaming herds of hen parties bused in from the home counties, intoxicated on the excitement of visiting 'big town' and publicly weeing everywhere. When I eventually got back to home it was 6am. What a fucking disaster.

Anyway, that's what comes to *my* mind when I think of Croydon.

The lower of these samples is then used to charge. If however in that time the level has dropped, lucky you.

I'm not the person you're responding to, and it might be that you're just too far to the left of me to consider these left-wing, but Labour's worst left-wing policies that immediately come to mind would be the ill-advised energy price freeze, the reduction of tuition fees to £6,000 a year, taxing people for owning expensive homes (a tax on capital! What could be more left-wing?)...

I don't think Labour's only problem was that they were too left-wing. They failed for other reasons too. But they *were* too left-wing and I can't see how this can be denied without intellectual dishonesty.

And please stop suggesting that people on the right of Labour should defect to the Tories. There is a gulf of difference between us Blairites and the Conservative party. It might be difficult for you to see, but we are quite clearly left-wing. It's frankly offensive. Have you seen what they've done to inequality, to the welfare state?

Austerity is only really a label for current Government policy. After five years of it, we are still running a deficit. Many say that this means what we have is not really austerity, just a gradual reduction in spending. A Labour government *should* run a surplus, shouldn't it? It doesn't need to eliminate the debt (as long as that's going down), but you can't spend more than you take in, and they're limited in what they can tax if they want growth. People believed this in 2010, this year, and they will in five years time. I suppose it comes down to what anti-austerity means to you exactly.

Better/more reliable mechanical disc brakes (you typically see these ones on ~£400-500 mountain bikes)

Rapid fire/trigger shifters, rather than grip shift, which is better is a personal preference, but most people prefer triggers over grip shift, also it means you can brake and change down at the same time (which is a very useful thing to be able to do!).

So if you're looking for an answer to ""how does the writer make X look fun?"" you could be looking for keywords like ""exhilarating"" or ""fantastic"".


If the question is a ""what evidence"" question then you just basically write out the answers from the text in prose, offering a bit of explanation if the answer is not obvious. So use connectives and the like to make it flow.


If it's an ""explain"" question, you will use short quotations and try to infer and read between the lines. Again, focus on the keywords and think of alternative words so you aren't regurgitating whats in the text. You could answer it like ""By saying X was ""unforgettable"", the writer gives us the idea that because it was so fun, they will never forget it"". You'll need at the very least 5 points in an ""explain"" question.


I hope that sort of helped - I noticed that it didn't answer your question as well as I'd hoped.

My bike use is probably limited to daytrips with the kids, and popping in to the village centre to pick up groceries and the like.

I live in Cambridgeshire, which is dead flat, but it is very boggy in places so I like the idea of disc brakes. I live 17 miles from work, so commuting to work requires a fair commitment of time and effort at this point.  A bigger wheel is not a bad idea if I do think about taking the cycle path to work, or riding in to Cambridge on a weekend.

I have no budget as such. I want a bike that is in the ""good"" range, and just outside of the ""it's shit"" range, which appears to be from £200 upwards. 

I can sort of remember my last bike. It was a mountain bike, but before they started putting suspension on to everything, so these days it would probably be known as a hybrid. It had a really interesting oval chainring, which meant I could spin the back wheel on each down stroke. Very torquey.  In a couple years I got [my motorcycle](http://www.motorcyclespecs.co.za/Gallery/Kawasaki%20GPX250R%2087.jpg) license, so the bike was left in the shed most days.

So, back to the point I made then:
&gt;In reality, the only way that fracking can pollute water supplies is if the waste water used in fracking operations isn't properly dealt with afterwards. We have very strict regulations around this in the UK that have worked well for decades (you do realise we've been using fracking already in the UK for decades, right?) so I'm pretty confident in our record here.

Why don't you go a do some research and substantiate your opinions. The Wiki article is pretty decent:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_Kingdom

A few extracts:

&gt;Although hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom has been common in North Sea oil and gas fields since the late 1970s,[1] and has been used in about 200 British onshore oil and gas wells since the early 1980s, the technique did not attract public attention until its use was proposed for onshore shale gas wells in 2007 and 2008.[2]

&gt;The DECC reported that it had approved the use of three chemical additives in hydraulic fracturing slurries by Cuadrilla: polyacrylamide (friction reducer); hydrochloric acid, which is used at concentrations of under 1% at which concentration it is considered non-toxic; and a non-toxic biocide. In its one hydraulic fracturing job to date, Cuadrilla used only non-toxic polyacrylamide, at a concentration of 0.05%. The Environment Agency will only issue permits for what it considers non hazardous chemicals.[75]",null,0,null,1432462880,null,0,false,0,crj7w98,null,t3_36z2h6,null,t1_crj7w98,null,t1_crj7pl7,null,null,null,1433237906,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

So a good recent example would be the ability of the EU to set tax rates on private employee's. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers%27_bonuses

As much as you may dislike bankers, I really don't see what business it is of the EU's to control something like that, but apparently at some point in the past we gave them that power. And that's another point, I'm under the impression that over the years and the various treaties, we've transferred a lot of powers to the EU which they're just not exercising right now, who knew they had the power to do this with bonuses? I didn't, I actually suspect most of the UK government didn't either.

And no UK party can change this. You can't vote for any party within the UK, even if they make it a manifesto commitment, that can alter this because we gave that power away.

It seems to be run pretty haphazardly if I'm brutally honest.  His apprenticeship scheme was managed by the local college for the first six months, and they can't seem to find their arse with their elbow.  The apprenticeship placement is nearly 20 miles from where we live and their advice on his concerns with travel was 'ask around and see if anyone can give you a lift'. He also had some pretty nasty workplace bullying going on and the college pretty much did nothing to help or support him.  Oh and none of his NVQ work has been marked in the six months he's been there.

Luckily the company he's actually placed at seems like a decent employer.  He's been given decent on-the-job training, isn't just making the tea or doing all the shit jobs,  got full support for the bullying issue, and has been told that there's a proper better-than-minimum-wage job waiting for him when the apprenticeship ends.  They've even made allowances for his health issues.  

After taking his travel expenses into account he's about £10 a week better off working that he was on ESA/JSA, but he has learnt new skills, not just the NVQ stuff, but also the non-quantifiable stuff that school &amp; college doesn't really teach like actually knowing how to behave in the workplace etc.

They would all be bought up by *huge* companies for little money, who would be able to pay a bare pittance to farm workers, in order to turn a profit. There are *huge* socio cultural side effects to this, not least the fact that huge areas of the countryside become a vested interest of a single company, and therefore a govt lobby.

&gt;We'd be much better off scrapping the CAP and the tariffs and phasing out most of our non-disaster foreign aid programs. Actually trading with developing nations on even terms would do far more good than sending them cash.

This would be absolutely suicidal domestically though. Its all well making the free trade argument, but be clear on what you lose. There are certain areas where protectionist policies are simply necessary. Do we really think we are better off by killing agriculture in this country, and the culture, good employment and other benefits it brings, just to avoid it being more inefficient and costly than would be ideal? 

We can only ride high on the value of our currency for so long. We killed heavy industry, textiles etc in this country with those exact same arguments. Countries like Germany didn't. Its a choice, not a necessity. The same kind of decline and post industrial malaise felt in specific cities and regions of this country, because of the deaths of those industries, would be exacted over the entire British countryside. 

It's also very short sighted. The protection of agriculture now is insurance against the future. Do you really want to abandon the knowledge which is held by the farming industry? Its a culture as much as it is a job. Huge amounts of knowledge and expertise, which the rest of us take for granted, are constantly being passed down and perfected. We don't know where we will be in 20 years time, but it seems clear that we are in decline with respect to the developing world. When we reach the point where it is no longer cheaper to import meat and grain from that parts of the world, due to falling relative living standards, land prices and wages here, don't we want to have a world beating domestic knowledge base to draw from?

null,false,JB_UK,null,null,null,"The plan for HS2 is to connect together eight of the largest cities in the UK (London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and then also Liverpool, Nottingham and Derby) serving [15-20 million people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom). With an extension to Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow, you can double the length of line, and serve another 4-5m people. The business case very barely stacks up for the former, when a substantial part of the justification is the capacity crunch on the existing line.

If you look at the [high speed rail map for Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom), you'll see these very expensive, ultra high speed services do not exist in similar countries to Scotland, in Northern Europe - Sweden, Norway and Finland. Outside of Spain (the land of airports to nowhere and massive corruption in local infrastructure spending), they are almost exclusively built in that 'blue banana' region of high population density, from Central England down through the Netherlands, Belgium, Eastern France, Western Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Northern Italy.

Sweden, Norway and Finland have the same sort of high speed / intercity rail that we already have, on the East Coast mainline to Edinburgh and the West Coast mainline to Glasgow. 

The reasonable thing is to continue upgrading the existing services (IIRC Network Rail spends about £5bn a year upgrading the general network across the country), improve the connection between Edinburgh and Glasgow (I would think in particular the commuter services connecting up the central belt), and run services which make use of the best lines possible — HS2 will actually lead to 50 minute reductions in the London to Glasgow and London to Edinburgh services, from 4h 30m to 3h 40m, because the new line would make up half of those journeys. The situations of Scotland, Northern England and Central England are different, and the money is better spent in different ways in different areas. Frankly, if the UK government was planning to spend £30bn extending HS2 into Scotland, I could easily see the SNP calling it a ludicrous Unionist white elephant attempting to knit Scotland into England, and calling for the money to spent more wisely upgrading infrastructure within Scotland.

Since its inception, 3 has never had any 2G fall back whatsoever.

3 is a MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator)
They run off the back of T-mobile (now EE since Orange bought T-mobile, and merged their networks).

However since the merger, there are a lot of disused Orange and T-mobile masts going spare. As a result 3 have bought a bunch of them, to increase their coverage footprint.

Since 3 now actually own these masts, they can create their own backhaul into their network. (Now becoming a proper physical network). This is how they could create a 2G fall back service/network.

But they've never had it, until (very recently, as you say)
But ONLY due to the fact, that they now actually have some physical infrastructure to utilise.

&gt;The problem is...well set up, halfords are terrible at building their bikes, they come to the shop partially built and the snotty nosed kid behind the counter sets them up. This usually means poor shifting and poor braking.


I bought a bike from Halfords. Cheap and shit maybe £130, but it was bought 'ready to ride' or so I thought. Half a mile from the shop the back wheel just fell out. Fortunately I was on a cycle path and not a road but it was bloody painful.

Dragged the thing back to the shop and the lad just shrugged and said he must have forgotten to do the back wheel up when he built it.

His repeated references to Britain considering itself culturally the same as Australia is not purely based on race. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of the British Empire will understand that a lot of the places we conquered we did not migrate to in large numbers: India would be a good example.

Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States were all subject to mass migrations from British, Irish and European settlers. Instead of merely administering existing societies the British set up new ones, driving the native population out or killing them. As such those countries are more similar to us, because they are forked from Britain. 

Second, the ease with which Germans can get into this country is due to the pivot away from the Commonwealth towards the EU, which was predicated far more on trade incentives than racial ones. Had those trade incentives not existed we would have closer ties to the Commonwealth than we do now, and indeed many conservatives resisted and continue to resist this pivot.

Lastly, Boyle's view that Australia is “one of the most racist countries in the world” is farcical.

This was him *quoting* Boris Johnson. Not his own statement, he used the quote to frame his argument. An Australian migrant to Britain is not considered the same as a brown skinned migrant. They are considered an ""ex-pat"" and you never hear their place in this country being discussed in negative terms.

&gt; Lastly, Boyle's view that Australia is “one of the most racist countries in the world” is farcical.

I don't think its a farcical statement. Its hyperbole but it certainly not farcical. Not even remotely.

I was speaking to someone who did an 'apprenticeship' at Halfords, in a retail position... i.e. a position that takes about two hours of training before you're good to go.

&gt;The __Webster ruling__ is a [test case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law\)) in association football [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_law) involving [Andy Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Webster), a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) formerly with [Heart of Midlothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [transfer regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(football\)) of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), football's [governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body), which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) of 1995 in its potential significance.

Thing is, 2-4 years is a hell of along time, relative, so it might be worth leaving put for another year at least. Thing is, is £16k enough to cover the deposit and other costs right now? If not, it's largely academic. 

If you haven't already, go talk to an *independent* whole of market mortgage adviser, and they should be able to run over all your cash flow and tell you what's affordable, and what's possible. Estate agent mortgage advisers can give a good idea too, but they tend to be too interested in selling something to you. If you're up north, 16K could represent something like up to 20% LTV, whereas down south it'd be more like 10%, and that might not be affordable on a monthly basis for you. Be aware - a GOOD mortgage adviser could tell you buying isn't a good option at all. And remember, you might be able to afford more, but don't fall into the trap of over-stretching. you want to be comfortable in that.

Find out what your end target is, and work to that. It saves a lot of confusion.

Well, this is rhetoric, which can be met in various ways: the Channel Tunnel makes rail connections to the continent actually possible, and HS1 and HS2 are used by all cities north of London as part of this connection. Scottish cities get the same time benefit as Leeds, and everywhere north (50 minute reduction to London, and [estimated 2h+ reductions to Paris](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141027142236/http://www.hs2.org.uk/news-resources/foi/foi11-356-existing-journey-time-and-predicted-journey-time-high-speed-rail)). If you really think there was some hidden fully costed plan to build a line into Scotland which has been shelved because of Scottish politics, I really think you need to look at this with unjaundiced eyes. In particular, as I said below, why other countries like Sweden and Norway aren't doing the same thing, given their wealth and similar population layout/density to Scotland.

I do see the Scottish government have done an actual business case for an Glasgow to Newcastle line in the last year or two. It would be interesting to look at the figures given the rather generous contortions necessary to make HS2 profitable - IIRC about half the benefit is businesspeople being able to work on the train, and extrapolating out from their GDP per hour.",null,0,null,1432469289,null,0,1432469613,0,crj98vb,null,t3_372o4z,null,t1_crj98vb,null,t1_crj8mce,null,null,null,1433238542,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

We need another big midfield goalscorer and while I agree Oscar will improve that's not him. I think we need a big big player with a lot of flair to play on the wing, like Reus or Bale.

&gt;

&gt;The __2015 FIFA Women's World Cup__ will be the seventh [FIFA Women's World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup), the quadrennial international [women's football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_association_football) world championship tournament. In March 2011, Canada won the right to host the event. The tournament will be held from 6 June to 5 July. 

&gt;The top three teams from [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) will qualify for the [2016 Summer Olympics women's football tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament), to be held in Brazil.   As [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_women%27s_national_football_team) is not an Olympic nation, their team is ineligible for the Olympics. If England are one of the top three teams, the last Olympic spot will go to the fourth-best UEFA team. [The Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association) had originally declared on 2 March 2015 its intention to enter and run teams on behalf of the [British Olympic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Olympic_Association) at the 2016 Olympics should England qualify.  However, following strong objections from the [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association), [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Wales) and [Northern Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Football_Association) football associations, as well as a commitment from [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) that they would not allow entry of a British team unless all four Home Nations were in agreement, the Football Association announced on 30 March 2015 that they would not seek entry into the Olympic tournament. 

&gt;The tournament will use the [Hawk-Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye) system as [goal-line technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-line_technology) for the first time.

People need to remember that the player has to actually sign with us, beyond us being able to afford him.

The thing that we need to be sure of in a hypothetical like this is that it's probably better to continue developing what you have in Lamela as opposed to risk his value on a new player who is a) not a sure thing to succeed (no one is a sure thing, no matter how talented)  and b) probably a compromise between what's available and what we can afford.  

so basically TL;DR-- if Levy has someone lined up and just needs to sell Lamela to balance the books, then I can justify it certainly, but if it's just trying to 'sell high', i think that's a stupid and shortsighted move.

I was just looking at Halford's current range and [this one](http://www.halfords.com/cycling/bikes/hybrid-bikes-and-classic-bikes/carrera-crossfire-2-mens-hybrid-bike-2015#tab1) isn't terrible, the main problem is that Halfords will probably screw it up and by the time you add the £50 that you'll have to pay to get a local bike shop to set it up properly and its no longer really worth it. That bike is virtually the same spec as the Norco one you posted btw, just with really heavy steel suspension forks. 

Talking of suspension forks, they are a good thing to have, even for on road riding if there are potholes and things, the problem with the really really cheap ones is that they hardly ever have decent (adjustable) damping so they're more like pogo sticks than suspension forks! Additionally they're really heavy because they're made of steel! Decent forks start at about £150, so you're just not going to get them on a low-end bike. However if you find you're using the bike a lot then suspension fork is a really good upgrade, something like [these](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/rockshox-paragon-tk-solo-air-forks-9mmqr-2015/rp-prod126296) air forks would keep it light weight but also make it more comfortable (notice how they're made of aluminium and magnesium...not steel!). That norco bike has a [threadless headset](http://www.twowheelingtots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/head-set-types.png) which means that if you wanted to fit suspension forks, you wouldn't need a new headset/stem/handlebars so the only cost over the cost of the fork would be the £20-30 a bike shop would charge to fit it (if you didn't want to do it yourself).

Those oval chainrings disappeared for ages but they're actually making a comeback now btw, some of the racing bikes even have chainrings which are specifically shaped for an individual rider's power output on each pedal rotation, its ridiculous...

If you are happy with a minimalist lifestyle then its pretty good. Find a cheap house up north, pay off the mortgage asap and then all you have to do is find £100 per month for council tax and perhaps another £100 for bills and nobody will bother you.

If you want to live the lifestyle associated with boomer generation (big house, cars, kids, kids going to university, multiple holidays abroad, dining out and then being on the receiving end of a big pension) then it gets more tricky. You will have to be either very successful in your chosen career or comfortable taking on a lot of debt. It can also go very badly wrong if divorce comes into it.

null,false,Subotan,,Labour Member,null,"&gt;I'd really like an explanation to that, if you have time.

Because generally, the poorest people in our society do not work minimum wage jobs - they work slightly above the minimum wage because they need every penny they can get. People who work on the minimum wage are, from a making policy perspective, those who can afford to earn the minimum wage - students, part-time mothers who are secondary earners in their household etc.

It's also bad policy to make companies do the leg work of redistribution. It's better value, better for employment, and better for growth if we just tax companies and redistribute that money rather than forcing them to pay that same amount in wages above the market wage.

I think we should keep the minimum wage, but I'm happy having it indexed so it rises above inflation every year. That's a job done, we can start advocating now for policies which better tackle poverty.

&gt;Whilst completely ignoring the solutions to better standards of living for the poor,

I believe we should redistribute wealth more than we do, but it is no good trying to do that without the precondition of effectively producing wealth.

null,false,fuckin442m8,null,null,null,"&gt;Anders Breivik was described as a terrorist without equivocation by many media outlets. He's picking and choosing here, choosing to use one quote that suits his point of view.

Oh please, the coverage of Breivik was unbelievably different to say, a muslim terrorist. 

Firstly when large parts of the media heard it was an attack they just immediately blamed muslims (fox).

Also not once did this get called a Christian fundamentalist terrorist attack, where were the calls for other christians to come out and condemn this action? Like there is after a muslim attack.

It's absolutely laughable to compare the coverage of Breivik to other terrorists, it was absolutely nothing like it - essentially treated as just a mad man with a  gun, which it always is when the 'terrorist' is a white guy. 


&gt;Quoting Katie Hopkins? Low hanging fruit. This is not the opinion of the majority, not even a significant minority, nearly everyone hated her for saying that, but he implied it's an acceptable viewpoint, it's far from that. But yes, I too wonder why she's given the platform to say such hateful ignorant things. I don't think that's about racism - it's more to do with publicity seeking.

lol you start off disagreeing with him then you agree... The point he's making is that she's given a platform in one of the most popular newspapers in the UK, her column reads like something Hitler would say.. That should not be encouraged by companies because it gets clicks, and you seem to agree with that...




&gt;All humans are racist to some extent. We shouldn't get complacent, but we should still recognise that compared to so many other countries, we are so much better.

This is insane. No we shouldn't pat ourselves on the back and say 'well, we're less racist than other countries'.

The idea that 'oh well, all humans are racist' is fucking disturbing, and I can't believe you're getting upvoted for this shit. 

&gt;He's obviously intelligent, and is a very capable speaker, but from what I've seen so far he's a bit simplistic, a bit populist, not that much better than Brand.

Of course it would.  Why wouldn't it?  If it was a terrorist Muslim attack, it would have been reported on as a terrorist Muslim attack.

&gt;As has literally every speaker in the history of speech. This is not a criticism. He is building an argument, what is he going to do, disagree with himself?

Of course not, but just like any other speaker he shouldn't get away with it. Don't you agree?

&gt;He was quoting the fact that she is allowed to have a voice in the national media. Think about it. She is literally preaching hate against Immigrants. Akala here is again criticising the construct of the media as a whole in that she is allowed a voice in the national narrative.

This is not a construct of the media as a whole, and as I said I was disappointed it got so much coverage, but Dianne abbot, for example, was allowed to say things about white people.

As for 'we are all racists' - I'm honestly not being condescending here, but if you read up about human behaviour vis a vis ingroups/outgroups then you'll see what I mean by that.  It doesn't mean we are all secret members of the EDL or similar, but it does mean that it's important that we acknowledge this part of our nature.

The basics though: Labour (red) on the left. Conservatives (aka Tories, blue) are on the right. Currently have a small majority in Parliament. Lib Dems (yellow) were part of the last coalition, have now massively decreased in size, are the middle of the road (some would say on the fence) party. Greens (green duh) are the more extreme left-wingers. Very small. Started off as a pressure group. UKIP (purple) more right-wing party. Very small, name means UK Independence Party. SNP (Scottish National Party). Pretty sure they're left wing. They won all but three seats in Scotland. Then you've got the smaller regional ones like Plaid Cymru in Wales (pronounced Plied Cum Re), Sínn Fein (Shin Fain (rhymes with pain)), DUP etc. 

Houses of Parliament is composed of two Houses, the Lords (unelected) and the Commons (elected). Executive (ie government) is drawn from the legislature. Unlike the US, we have a fused system. We have devolved bodies in Scotland (Scottish Parliament called Hollyrood), Wales (Welsh Assembly), and Northern Ireland (Northern Irish Assembly called Stormont) (as well as the Greater London Assembly). The Prime Minister isn't elected separately and we don't have electoral colleges or the like. (Sorry my knowledge of the US system isn't very detailed). We elect MPs based on FPTP and then whichever party has the majority in the Commons, their leader becomes the Prime Minister. General Elections are once every five years. The devolved Assemblies have more PR in them, as do the EU elections. WA and SP use AMS, NIA uses STV. EU used closed party list. Mayoral uses SV. Judiciary wise, EU law supersedes our own (precedent set in Factortame 1991), but the EU law is separate from the European Council which rules on the European Convention on Human Rights (which we have under the Human Right Act 1998). We do have judicial review as such, but Parliament is sovereign so they cannot overturn decisions made by Parliament. They can say the government is acting ultra vires (outside their powers) and they can also declare a law contravenes the HRA but have no power to change it. Our constitution is uncodified. Election days are Thursdays because that was market day, so most people will be in town. There are 650 constituencies, but you only need something like 320 seats (I don't know the exact number because it varies) because by convention the Speaker remains neutral, ad the Sínn Fein MPs never sit in Westminster, so you can gain a working majority, without an 'actual' majority. That was a brief overview of my A Level course, if you need any clarification, or have any questions, you can PM me and I'll do my best to answer them :)

Some of the larger issues right now are to do with whether we will leave the EU or not, whether to reform the House of Lords, and reform of the electoral system.

Oh and a faux pas tip: the American version of the peace sign (with your knuckles facing away from you) is similar to giving someone the finger over here (I think it's similar to 'up yours'). Reverse it so your knuckles face you, and that's the English version of a peace sign. And don't claim how you were the reason we won World War Two ;)

This is such bullshit. The call centre may be outsourced (subcontracted) but as far as you are concerned the people in store and the people on the phone work for the same company. You should have no need to worry about how their business is structured.

From reading their complaints code (http://ee.co.uk/help/safety-and-security/my-digital-life/complaints-code-of-practice) it looks like you've already tried Step 1 and have been unsuccessful when you first contacted them. Go to Step 2 and call their specialist team, who will apparently call you back within 72 hours. Tell them what you were told on your previous contacts with EE and demand to open a complaint. Don't let them fob you off with any bollocks about a ""note of dissatisfaction"" or some other euphemism. You want to open a complaint and you want a complaint reference number (you need to establish a paper trail in their system). Tell them what happened and what you want done to resolve it. The law gives them up to 8 weeks to resolve your complaint by their internal code of practice before you can take it to an impartial ombudsman (looks like EE use http://www.cisas.org.uk/). You need to be explicit that they have a statutory 8 weeks to resolve this complaint to your satisfaction, and that if they don't you are perfectly happy after that to take your complaint to the Ombudsman. Make sure to mention both the 8 week limit and that you are aware of the Ombudsman, because the person on the other end of the phone will sure know about these and may be instructed to listen out for such red flags.

So many customers are not educated about how complaints processes are supposed to work. You often have to know what to say to make real progress with these things, as some companies get rid of complaints simply by frustrating uninformed customers.

Sorry, this post turned into a miniature rant about complaints procedure. I used to work for a telecoms company call centre (as a customer service dogsbody) and have also hauled NPower to their Ombudsman over a long-running complaint, so I know a bit about how to arm yourself when complaining to a company like this.

Want an example? Independent observers point out that doctors from all walks of life have the same rate of error. In the UK you are three times more likely to be reported to the GMC if you are Asian. As in. If a white doctor screws up, and an Asian doctor screws up, the Asian is three times more likely to be reported for the same screw up. In addition, the GMC is stricter and more likely to take heftier punishments for the same error. This is among freaking doctors. An example? My fiancee nearly died after a septic ulcer. She was admitted into her own hospital. When she rejoined her final year of medicine they told her she should take a year out. I suggested she ask if she could make up the hours and the hospital agreed. At the end of the year they failed her. Reviewing the case history it turns out she was failed because she refused to accept the year out. Another woman who was white who broke her leg skiing was allowed to take more time off (Note, nearly dying vs. a broken leg) and was allowed to sit without bias. The University and GMC only relented when we threatened legal action. No one was willing to help her. Not the University, not the GMC (who are meant to help doctors) and not the Student Union. The ombudsment ruled that the University had procedural errors and that there had been a systemic bias throughout that year towards my fiancee. The woman in charge got removed from teaching programs. We didn't get any damages. My fiancee had to repeat the year. A net loss (since she's an international student) of 24,000 quid of income and 80 K worth of fees. It cost us a hundred grand.

The argument put forward by the university is that a doctor should know their limits. Our response was that never testing your limits means that doctors will never achieve anything and the university had no qualms about lionising a young lady who fractured her leg on a holiday for pleasure and her determination to succeed despite that but someone who nearly died and pushed herself to get back on her feet after a major abdominal surgery to get back to work is demonised. It's hard not to look at race when we know racism exists and we experience it daily and we notice that we aren't treated the same.

That is what doctors have to put up with, imagine what everyone else has to deal with.

At no point have white people been legally thrown out of trains for sitting in the nice seats. At no point have rights been taken away that were available to others. At no point have massacres been excused or white people have had to make do with inferior things. 

If we compare black on white racism, it doesn't harm white people as much as white on black racism.

2. The sizing hierarchy goes: Studio - 1BR - 2BR - (etc). Anything described as a 1BR will automatically have the other rooms (Living/Kitchen/Bath) unless stated otherwise that you're sharing a bathroom or kitchen. This is unlikely in a 1BR (or above) but not so unlikely in a Studio (where the Living Room and Bedroom are the same room).

3. Same here, fridge/stove are usually included, microwave sometimes included, dishwasher/washing machine usually included only in more expensive places. If you're from Europe you might want to enquire about the taps, we still use separate hot and cold taps rather than mixers, which confuses Europeans, but modern properties might have mixers so ask the agent.

4. If bills are included it will say in the ad, that is more common when sharing than living solo but at the lower end of the market some landlords include some 'estimated' bills in the rent (probably due to a previous tenant not paying the bills and running off), avoid this wherever possible as their estimate will be high so you'll be paying too much. Check for any other associated fees, sometimes there's 'gardening' fees etc. 

The bottom line in the UK presently is that rental property is in very short supply and as a result it's become overpriced and difficult to find so expect to act impulsively rather than slowly when you find somewhere, as everyone else will be.

&gt;Of course not, but just like any other speaker he shouldn't get away with it. Don't you agree?

Backing up your arguments with facts and opinions is something every speaker should be able to do. Disprove the point he has made, not the fact that he is trying to make a point.

&gt;This is not a construct of the media as a whole,

That isn't what he is saying. The fact that she is allowed to preach legal hatred and it is accepted and allowed to continue is the point. Imagine Abu Hamza had a column in the Daily Mail and called White people Cockroaches... 

Interesting link, thanks for that. I understand what it is saying - and I'm obviously not a social psychologist or theorist or anything, but racism is a problem that we can work towards. I do not actively identify as white and therefore must actively compete against black people, I just happen to be white. I do however actively identify as a Manchester United supporter and actively participate in the rivalries that are implied within that sphere. 

I think that in an age of globalisation we should be able to eventually come together to acknowledge differences but not necessarily have to 'compete' or discriminate against them. I grew up in a very multicultural environment where more than 50% of my school were non-white (mixture of Indian, Pakistani, Tamil, Singalese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese and everything else), and this was in London (still embarrassed at supporting United haha). From my upbringing in a cultural melting pot like london there was a lot of acknowledgement of differences (casual racism etc was engaged in by everyone - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri0qiAita4s&amp;spfreload=10 Zizek has an interesting opinion on such matters) but never active discrimination or racism. 

I know it sounds cheesy but if we all just identify as people as an 'in-group' and disregard the colour of your skin like all of my friends did growing up, which I think will become easier and easier to do due to the advancing freedom of travel and globalisation, then we will be able to accept racism isn't necessarily an inherent part of a person.

This isn't to disregard Social identity theory entirely, there can still be ingroups and out groups, but I think it is important to work towards exterminating discrimination based on uncontrollable factors (race, nationality, gender etc.)

No proper competition for Lukaku, who he has played into the fucking ground this season. Arouna Kone. He obviously has a large say in how our back line plays? We've been uncharacteristically bad at the back this season.

Our whole team moves the ball far too slowly and have no idea on next phase management. We don't pull team apart to use a passign game effectively.

null,false,haventevenreddit,null,null,null,"Yes, that's right; a better chance at getting a ticket. Basically a member is second in line for any tickets before they go on general sale (which, for league games is rare unless you want to sit in front of a post). 

Match day tickets don't vary for the league, that's only away games where that happens and that is controlled by the home team. With that in mind, you're looking at £45 to £55 per adult ticket depending on seat position. 

The Europa and other cup games will have different prices, typically, and I'm being very general here, early stages of the Europa would be maybe £10 cheaper per ticket. 

As far as priority is concerned for the cup games, this is where there are rewards for loyalty so the more games you build up on your history the better your chance of eligibility for the prime games. Eg. The Carling Cup final v Wembley is one where I benefitted as I had been to a previous round of the same cup. That got me into a ballot where I was randomly selected. 

Some of eligibility has been ridiculous this season. There was a game (think it was the Villa semi final) where you had to have been to the previous four or five home FA Cup games. That spanned about three seasons! 

Two other options for tickets by the way; there's almost always corporate tickets available for £100 per head and that includes food and a meet and greet with a former player.. Expensive but worth it for a special treat.

The other option is ticket touts. Not something I've done but if you just hang around the ground before kick off you're bound to bump into a lad offering tickets. Risky and they're gonna be more than face value. 

The membership is a no brainer for me and it's not expensive and you actually get discount on purchases online and at the club stores too (plus this season they had an open training day at Anfield which was exclusively for members and cost just a fiver.

null,false,MrLiamD,newcr-6,Robertoeing the line,null,"Do you not think our performances and results since exiting the Europa League back up that argument a bit? He did go in with this squad, but it's a squad at the start of the season (and still most people) are saying is one of our best squads of recent years. He did make a mistake of playing Barkley wide too much, but at the time we didn't really have an option. McGeady was injured a lot and on poor form when playing, Mirallas missed chunks through injury, Atsu was terrible and also missed a large chunk at the African Cup of Nations, Oviedo has been constantly injured, Osman and Pienaar were injured for ages, and when january came around he noticed the problem, brought in a winger so he could play how he wanted and look what happened. Lukaku is the long term option, we had to get him in and couldn't really afford back up this season, it's not his fault Kone was injured so much and Eto'o didn't work out, we were all buzzing about Eto'o when he came in. We were uncharacteristically bad at the back but the vast majority of those problems came down to individual mistakes (as the stats support) rather than any tactical naivety, when the players built a bit of confidence and Stones came back in look how good our defence has been. Of course we overachieved, look at our finances compared to the rest of the top half of the table and even a few in the bottom half, because he did it once doesn't mean if he doesn't replicate it immediately he's a failure. There was a problem with our tactics being spotted and people knew how to stop it, but a large part of our game is fitness and we were shattered from too much football, you only had to watch a few of our games around the Christmas period with a half decent footballing eye to see that, if you don't think fatigue played a huge part in that particular poor patch of form then you're quite frankly deluded. Well if he thought one man was enough then he'd clearly not be looking for 3 or 4 signings as he's said, he's just highlighted the No. 10 as a key area, which is completely right, any sensible observer of our season would agree. He could have rotated more and played young players a bit more, but a decent amount of them were out on loan getting consistent first team experience, and others were playing together in a team in the U21's so when a bunch come up together they will know each other inside out (it's not a fucking secret that this is why Germany and Spain have such good national teams and their acadamies are so superior to those in England, look at Chelsea, they're doing the same and have a phenomenal bunch of youngsters coming through). He didn't have much choice but to play the same team, with such key injuries in periods of time with a shit load of games. I am one of those who think Besic should have been given more time, but he's still played 22 league games. When we were stuck in a rut with the same team, he had very little choice. The Howard/Robles situation, I'll give you that one, he should have stuck with Robles, although Howard has gotten an embarrassing amount of flak from some Everton fans that makes me ashamed of some of our fanbase. Blaming Martinez for Garbutt going when Baines is arguably our least droppable player and one of our only leaders is ludicrous. 

These opinions are that of a person who watches Everton games only and has no footballing mind at all. Look past the superficial, blaming the manager for all of that can only come from briefly thinking about it without understanding how football works, or not knowing half as much as you should before commenting.",null,0,null,1432476447,null,0,false,0,crjbft0,null,t3_373748,null,t1_crjbft0,null,t1_crjaty6,null,null,null,1433239575,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

https://www.quandl.com/data/WORLDBANK/GBR_SI_POV_GINI-United-Kingdom-GINI-index

It shows a rise in Gini coefficient from 1992 (start of series) to 2000, then broadly flat from 2000 to now. I don't think this really tells a story of inequality rising under Labour. One could just as easily argue that it took Labour three years to moderate the trend of increasing inequality inherited from the Conservative governments of the previous 18 years.

However, it does show that Labour has not been effective at *decreasing* inequality in that time. That said, I'd rather vote for a party which has been shown not to make inequality worse than a party which has been shown to make it worse. It would be nice to have an option to choose a party which would reduce inequalty, but hey...

Then again, the series is quite sparse. There is a downward trend from 2000 to 2005 and the next observation in 2008 is post the 2007 crash. So perhaps the downward trend continued right up until the crash. In that case we would see a downward trend from 2000 to 2007.

- Unlike the U.S. electorate, who recently polled as being 60% against the NSA's surveillance, the British electorate is utterly, fuckwittedly apathetic towards the surveillance infrastructure, stuck on the ""nothing to hide"" stage and will probably stay that way.
- Recently elected a government committed to drastically INCREASING these programs.
- Is drifting towards nationalist, isolationist politics. Moving away from the EU and the protections it offers, scrapping of human rights act, etc.

If the UK votes to leave the EU it's going to get exactly what it fucking deserves for being so complicit and passive for so long. Snowden used the phrase ""turnkey tyranny"" and the UK is begging for it.

For REAL pizza, go to https://www.lafavoritadelivered.com/, they make by far the best pizza in Edinburgh and probably one of the best in Britain.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"No, it leads to a competitive job market, get some skills in an in demand field or get paid the wage rate the the job deserves to be paid. People being overpaid is the problem, if you paid £9/hr instead of £13/hr, you can hire 3 people instead of 2 for £1/hr more. This happens in every field in existence, be it Doctors, Engineer, Scientists, Teachers, Recruiters, Business Analysts, they all work for the equilibrium price point.

You should get paid what you are worth, apprenticeships do not achieve this as they make an artificial price point stifling a true competitive market, but as proved with the person above, the wage rate for that job isn't £13/h, there should be no job that pays £13/h that a apprentice can functionally do, all it proves is that it is over paid and requires little skills in the first place, or they have done an irrelevant apprenticeship in a field with no demand. 

If the wage point decreases so much that people are no longer willing to do it, then it is too low, so you raise it again, that is how demand and supply works, people don't deserve a certain wage for a job, they get paid what the equilibrium price point is, assuming that is above minimum wage. 

&gt; There is almost always someone more desperate or less understanding of the value of their labour who is willing to undercut you

This just isn't true at all, maybe if you have essentially no skills, but in an skilled profession, or one that requires any amount of training or aptitude, and that includes some very easy, but mundane and repetitive jobs, there is a price point where people won't work for the rate you are offering, so either you get a crappy applicant pool at the interviews, or you get people using your job as a stop gap to a better one and leaving in 6 months, therefore meaning you have to waste another chunk of money on the recruitment, on the HR, on the small amount of training, all which means you were probably better off just paying 10% more in the first place. 

Then if the price point of that industry is too low, the skilled individuals will move away from it into other fields to get a reasonable wage for their ability, this happens all the time now, thousands of psychology graduates come out each year all with essentially no jobs existing for people with undergraduate degrees in psychology, so they move into business, retail, and other generic graduate jobs, engineers don't often do this because their is high demand so they get paid better in engineering than other fields. 

Now coming back to the point of having no skills, why do you expect to get paid above minimum wage? You are unskilled labour, you aren't even worth that, that is an artificial price point to increase living standards of the poor. What apprenticeships do is create a derogatory price point, that is actually below the equilibrium point as no one would work for that level as it isn't sustainable. What needs to occur is that ""apprentices"" should have some form of recourse that means that if they can show it isn't an apprenticeship, i.e. they are just doing a job an employee would, then the business has to pay the minimum wage for all backdated hours, or even better the wage rate for that job if it is actually higher than minimum wage, apprenticeships should give you an overview of skills that are required to be successful in that business as a whole, not mean you are doing a job for the business, if you are doing a job, at most that should be shadowing someone and helping them out so you get experience in the activity, at no point should you be doing anything truly independently like an employee.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"Well then look at the demand in that field, if you are doing an apprenticeship in an field with no demand, you are an idiot, plain and simple, once again, you deserve £2 an hour if you can't look at the demand in the industry, no intelligent person does in an apprenticeship in a field that isn't going to lead to a high probability of a job, that is why people pay for degrees, to get jobs in offices, or in that field, people take £2 an hour to be trained as Plumbers, Roofers, Electricians, etc. because once they are trained they have the potential of £25-50K a year, if you are stupid enough to take £2 a hour to work in a bar or retail, which literally takes hours to train someone and any monkey can do and have an equilibrium price point that is maybe £1 above minimum wage, then you are probably aren't smart enough to be worth minimum wage in the first place. 

Facts are you don't have to do these apprenticeships, you can get out of them, if you actually have the intelligence to look up your rights within them, I mean they have plenty of time to do it, they are unemployed, and their is access to the internet at every library if they are extremely poverty ridden. Facts are if you can't use this kind of basic technology to look up this information you probably don't have the skills necessary for a lot of minimum wage or slightly above minimum wage jobs that require the minor use of computer systems and therefore aren't worth the wage rate that goes with them.   

&gt; you hire an apprentice at £2 an hour with the promise of £13 an hour after 12 months, and then sack him at the end so you can pick up another apprentice.

No person doing an apprenticeship at £2/h deserves a £13/h rate, that is £25,350 a year, your average graduate starts of £21K, with what is far more aptitude and essentially 3 years of training in a field, the illusion that an apprentice should even be able to do a £13/h job without years of training, just like Plumbers, Electricians, Roofers, do have, is just laughable. The job isn't worth £13/hr, most likely isn't worth more than £16-18K a year and that is the price point these unskilled apprentices should be expecting, the idea that they are going to be worth £25k a year is just naive, that is Master Degree level of starting point, i.e. 4 years full time training of people far smarter than these apprentices in the first place, in high skill industries.

Debts

&gt;Living together and marriage

&gt;You are liable for any debts which are in your own name only, but not for any debts which are just in your partner's name.

&gt;You may be responsible for the whole of debts in joint names and for other debts for which you have 'joint and several' legal responsibility. For example, in England and Wales, if you owe council tax, you and your partner will both be responsible for the debt, regardless of whether one of you contributes or not.

&gt;If your partner has a debt for which you have acted as guarantor, you will also be held legally responsible for paying it.

&gt;If you're married, you will not be responsible for any financial obligations or debts that your partner had before you were married.

&gt;For more information, in England and Wales, about joint debts if you split up with your partner and aren't married, see Breaking Up Checklist on the Advicenow website at: www.advicenow.org.uk.

Based purely on that, I would say you are not obligated to pay her a penny. The debts were incurred before the wedding and hence before marriage any way, so ""you will not be responsible for any financial obligations or debts that your partner had before you were married"" seems relevant.



Also:

&gt;We are legally man and wife and that actually means something

made me rage harder than anything I have seen today, in light of the fact that she cheated, so I really hope she doesn't get a penny out of you.

(I am not a lawyer. Make sure you get proper legal advice before committing to any action.)

EDIT:

[Debts you are not liable for](http://www.bainesandernst.co.uk/help-and-advice/personal-finance/responsible-marriage-debts/)

&gt;You are not liable for any debts your spouse has run up in their sole name, even though you live at the same address. The only exception to this is utility bills.

If you rent through an agency, you have to pay them a fee. Keep this in mind. A lot of the letting agencies are student focussed, and there are a LOT of crap landlords that like to patch over problems (painting over mold instead of actually fixing the cause, and things like that) they will then photograph the flat in it's freshly painted state and use these photos for the adverts on the agency website for the next few years. Look for places to rent on Gumtree, I have found my last 2 flats listed there and it usually avoids having to pay agency fees, though the downside is you usually deal direct with the landlord to get any problems solved. My last landlord was great, my current landlord is not so good. YMMV.  

You usually won't have to pay any maintence fees, unless you live in one of the blocks in Cardiff Bay. They are mostly really nice flats in that area, recently built (most of Cardiff's housing is old terraced buildings), though the price is a bit higher than elsewhere in the city.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Amputation through implants is an uncommon problem but one that is becoming more problematic. The issue is that surgical instruments tend to be made from stainless steel for corrosion resistance. These materials are not very hard in comparison to other steels, but they are easy to clean, and sterilize and in body tissues tend to stay reasonably sharp.

The problem is that orthopaedic plates tend to be made of the same sort of steel, or increasingly titanium or titanium alloy which are significantly harder, and will end up with the plate cutting the saw blade, rather than the other way around.

The worst are orthopaedic drill bits - these are a very hard ferritic stainless steel, so that they stay sharp after extensive drilling. A broken off drill bit is a real nuisance, because no surgical tools can touch them - they are also strongly magnetic, which will cause severe interference with MRI scanning of the area.

In general, if amputation is planned, the recommendation is that the limb be X-rayed to make sure that there are no metal plates, and if there are, the surgery should be planned so as to avoid them - by going higher up the limb.

In terms of the urgency of surgery. It's difficult to know, but as it was a vascular surgeon it is likely that the amputation was for an acutely ischaemic leg - i.e. a leg where the blood supply has been lost, but the leg is no longer salvageable. The amputation must be performed as a matter of considerable urgency, as leakage of toxins from dead and dying tissue can be fatal.

Ultimately, the mistake seems to have been not thoroughly checking for a metal plate before surgery. The only other option, it seems to me, would be to have converted to a higher amputation part way through the surgery.

does this epitomize our season.. poor touches all over the field...waiting for captain fantastic to pull some magic but really, he can't anymore. Yet we start him because it's his farewell tour (wish he never said anything-it's been a distraction all year) no real goal scoring threat all year, which is evident now. only threat we've had going forward is tricky dribbling in the box which we can only hope rewards us with a PK (coutinho and lallana)--&gt; which we should have had one PK imo. lastly, we're a possession team with midfielders who can't keep possession. Gerrard wants to spray it forward, lucas has never been one to retain possesion, even though he's a cdm, and Henderson is being dragged wide with every possession. Lastly, I do think that we do have good CBs. i think skrtl and Sakho are good, but when we have Moreno and Can next to them- who aren't great defensive players, we're just a whole liability at the back.
And it's been fun typing this because in the five minutes it took me to write this out, Stoke have scored another goal.
also, if anything, this game has solidified Rodgers getting the ax,e unfortunately- as I do like him..

The pimples in rosacea are not comedonal (based on clogs) they are inflammatory in nature so it is key to reduce systemic inflammation, and avoid known irritants like drying alcohol and fragrance. There is drying alcohol in the LRP gel too.

A dermatologist might run different tests, give you a completely different diagnosis or dual diagnosis (eg. histamine intolerance, demodicosis, some form of eczema/ dermatitis). The dose of oral antibiotics is much lower in rosacea - they actually do not work as antibiotics but as anti inflammatories (not to say you should take them, just want you to be informed).

Fish oils do not substitute for oily fish, they only supply omega-3s not bioavailable vitamin D, B group vitamins and so on. Most nuts are rich in pro inflammatory omega-6s, most westerners eat too much so be careful with these. If you want to supplement discuss this with a registered dietician or other medical professional ... again a dermatologist would be better than a GP.

A rosacea diagnosis should mean a different skincare routine, diet and lifestyle modification (avoiding triggers) not just prescribed medication. Broad spectrum sunscreen (ideally physical/ mineral only) is the cornerstone of rosacea self care, which makes the vitamin D in oily fish even more important.

Or Rambo, Jack, Ozil, Santi wouldn't stroll into your midfield in place of Lucas or Henderson or Coutinho or  Lallana, Or Giroud/Alexis even Welbeck or Walcott wouldn't be starting up front every game in front of Balotelli or Lambert?

Sharing workers in Schengen requires similar but opposite agreements: if Spanish workers are going to be working in the Netherlands or Latvia, Spain wants them to have the same (as far as possible) rights that they would have if they worked inside Spain. ^^edit1 And there's also a need for law enforcement to catch suspected criminals on the other side of an open Schengen border if they cross.

To be honest, this is Stoke playing ***extremely*** well, and us playing ***extremely*** shite. Players in key positions have been astoundingly outplayed. 

Can being lost in our back right pocket when Stoke attacks, Skrtel and Sakho not closing down opponents like N'Zonzi and Adam, both players with thundering shots, a lack of a forward resulting in the need for much more fluid paced-out play through wingers means this is ultimately a different team from what we've seen all season.

The main issue here is key things going wrong at key points for Rodgers here, a bad lineup selection, and a generally split opinion of him at the moment here in r/liverpoolfc means everyone's going crazy at him for this match, sure, this match makes me sick to the stomach, but really, some people loved Rodgers at the same time last season, and here we have a great example of how fickle football fans can be.

This 4-3-3 in the second half looks a bit better, but again it seems like we're playing a weird version where Gerrard is behind Cou and Lallana. At least these three players can pass to each other and move off each other. Finally some team chemistry.

My advice is to buy second hand. If you know somebody who knows more about bikes, get a cheap but solid runner from a private seller, I bought a YBR125 for £750 last year, and it was perfect. If you're not sure, buy from a dealer. 

I  mean, it totally depends on how much money you have to throw at bikes. Personally, I'd spend £700 - £1,200 on a used 125 and then in a year (or however long you have to wait these days), sell it or part ex it for a bigger bike. Used bikes will retain their value better, and if you drop it or scratch it it's not *quite* as devastating. You should be able to get a used R125, they're good and popular bikes. I part exed my old YBR for my Duc and got £800 towards the value for it so I actually came off pretty good. I bought the YBR from a dodgy bloke off gumtree and was absolutely fine.

Some Clinique products are pretty harsh and can damage the skin barrier, it would be worth analysing ingredients so you don't purchase similar products. As you say sulphate surfactants are not great, but parabens are fine for most people. There are many poisons, irritants, allergens and toxins in nature, it is not necessarily better.

Just select and introduce one new product at a time: firstly a gentle cleanser, then a sunscreen (can also be a moisturiser). Patch test everything - see the sidebar at /r/skincareaddiction/ for how to do this.

Slowly work though our ingredients Wiki and the mega reviews linked to in the sidebar. Just do it in bitesize chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Niacinamide is an excellent active for acne and excessive sebum production.

Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating: many wholefoods are rich in B group vitamins. If you wish to supplement discuss this with a registered dietician or other medical professional. Micronutrients work synergistically and in opposition, randomly supplementing can do more harm than good by causing or worsening imbalances.

This Charlie Hebdo one uses the word ""Terror"" once and thats in the headline ""Three Days of Terror"":

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30708237

Here's one about the 7/7 attacks and ""Terrorist"" is used once in the ""The Investigation"" section talking about radicalisation.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm

EDIT: Here goes the 9/11 article, ""Terror"" is used to call it a ""day of terror"" and then near the bottom when mentioning the ""War on Terror"".

http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/11/newsid_2514000/2514627.stm

Also the only time I see Islam mentioned is this sentence in the Charlie Hebdo article

Ultimately, this performance cannot be solely on Rodgers. Not like people are making it out to be. Rodgers isn't physically out there playing the game, as a manager, he hasn't told them before the start of the game to concede 5 goals for the fun of it. 

What's happened is the 11 players have had a terrible game and as an emotional fan experiencing it we need someone to place the  blame, to be able to deal with this, to cope. But that's simply not how football works, at the end of the day the manager is at the there is not one person playing this game from the  sidelines, and if you really think that Rodgers set this game up tactically so that it was likely that we'd concede 5 goals in the first half then you are deluded. 

Wenger lost 5-1 to us last season, heck Mourinho lost 5-3 to spurs this season, no one was calling for his head! I know it's a compound issue and that our performance has been shitty as of late, but Klopp isn't some miracle worker that will save us and bring eternal glory. The fact of the matter is, and it's been said a billion times, we were dealt a shit hand over last summer. We lost 50+ goals in SAS and weren't able to attract players to replace them. Rodgers isn't oblivious to this, he's a premier league manager and I know he will, with his best efforts, ensure that Liverpool don't make the same mistake again. If that isn't good enough to make an impact then fine, sack Rodgers. But if we start sacking managers every time we have a relatively bad (5th isn't even that bad) season then we will get nowhere in terms of long term growth, we will forever be stuck in this cycle.

Take some time out to cool off after this game, everyone is getting way too emotional about this. ",null,0,null,1432482266,null,0,false,0,crjdzvb,null,t3_373fqz,null,t1_crjdzvb,null,t3_373fqz,null,null,null,1433240782,null,-7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-7,null

The Army is different though because they have records and statements, but you're right it would be impossible and unnecessary to  track down every case.

&gt;Or we could do what the politicians claim to want and draw a line and move on. Properly move on, not the way Sinn Fein and you are pretending to.

Had NI moved on in the way you're suggesting there would be no Bloody Sunday Inquiry,  which is something I'm very glad happened as I'm sure many are. Incidents like Bloody Sunday and Ballymurphy need to be investigated.

As someone who has worked in retail most of her working life, I can tell you not just any monkey can do it.

In theory yes, but its only the actual basis of the job is the easy part.

The hard part is the customers. Not every customer is going to be the pleasant *""I'm just going to walk around the shop, I know what I'm looking for, I'm fine on my own.""* kind.

Dealing with complaints and mistakes is one of the hardest things to do in retail, often customers will be impatient and ask things of you that you just can't do, sometimes they can get quite irate and all the while, you have to keep your cool and deal with the situation in a calm and professional manner.

It takes a lot to be able to keep yourself professional and calm when dealing with customers.

It's one reason I wont work in retail any more, I just got sick of dealing with shitty customers.

(Disclaimer: I know most customers are wonderful and don't cause issues, but there are those out there who will sometimes go to extreme lengths.)

Edit: £13/h is a touch high for a basic retail job however, I do agree there, unless your in management or higher up in the company. But £2/h is not even enough to live on, it's no wonder we all have to stay living with our parents for so long after we leave school.",null,0,null,1432482305,null,0,1432482515,0,crje0kb,null,t3_372rb6,null,t1_crje0kb,null,t1_crjbza6,null,null,null,1433240792,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Fact is that I made [the following comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2i0yxb/martin_skrtel_dejan_lovren_won_just_1_tackle/ckxyk9m):

&gt;Exactly.

&gt;Last season our defending was awful but we were scoring with such abandon with Sturridge and Suarez at the helm of the attack that things were covered.

&gt;Now that Suarez has gone and Sturridge is injured we've lost our attacking impetus but still have our shit defence.
It's pretty simple really: we have wasted £100m on players who aren't world class in lieu of spending it on players who supposedly have 'potential'.

&gt;All good and well if you're graduating from being mid-table to wanting to compete for any European football but if you want to go from battling to get Champions League football to genuine, consistent title contenders who see Champions League qualification as a given then you have to replace the goal machine-sized hole up front that Suarez created by leaving with an expensive but proven striker (the likes of Falcao and Sanchez (I know he refused us but still) spring to mind) and crucially, fix the leaky defence.

&gt;We have done a Spurs.

in October and was downvoted to -7 whilst a comment from a guy who argued that we'd done better than Spurs with our windfall from the Suarez sale was upvoted to +14.

He seemed to say the name Great Britain is ""intimately tied"" to the fact that we invaded everyone. Maybe I missed it but didn't really get what his argument for that was. Other people have pointed out why we are called Great Britain.

He then points to crime statistics to support his argument of systemic racism. I would also like to point out the link between wealth and crime. Then the link between [race and wealth.](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/04/08/the-racial-wealth-gap-not-just-an-american-problem/) Minorities are poorer, therefore more likely to commit crimes. Money is not racist and our system of earning money is not systemically racist in my opinion. This is an historical problem as wealth is inherited.

I didn't really like his point about ""grandchildren of Nazis"". 

We are culturally similar to Australia on the whole. 

His point about who we see at borders I though was a bit naff too.

Not sure if the immigrants were white they would have been saved either. Our disgusting attitudes towards immigrants are not just about skin colour.

I do think there are privileges in being white. I think society should do more to combat them. In my opinion they are a by-product of inherited wealth and a hangover from colonialism. A by-product of the system and not a function of it. Part of the problem with the system is it tries to keep power with the powerful. In the west, a lot of powerful people are white.

Hopefully I'm making myself clear. On the whole I don't think his arguments supported any of his claims.

As a person who worked in retail for several year, yes, any monkey can do it, people with no GCSE's can do it, your assumption are all based on people being stupider than monkeys. You require the intellect of a monkey, some people don't manage that. 

Facts are being pleasant and being able to work with people isn't a low supply skill, most people can manage it, and by most I mean 80-90% of people, so yes, 10-20% of people are too much of a dick to work in retail and even then not really, there are plenty of retail jobs with only minor customer interaction, and you can just refer all the dicks to customer service (where yes you will have to deal with the real shitters), the other what? 30 million working age people can do it, there is no lack of supply, essentially it is limitless, the problem for retail come from the other side where people use it as a stop gap and it has a high throughput, luckily it essentially requires no training, maybe 2 days for anyone who is going to be close to worth keeping, so the high throughput isn't a problem as the price point doesn't have to be raised. 

Retail management is a whole different ball game as it is so mundane and BS, while just been based on how many hours you can spend in the store per day as everyone is so useless, that a lot of people can't be arsed with it and quit, even at the £25K a year point, no point in earning £25k a year if you end up working 60 hour weeks and end up on what is essentially £8 an hour.

I like Rodgers, and this whole season I was holding out hope he'd turn it around. Yet I just don't think he has what it takes to lead us to the top. We got 6th. 8 pts off fourth, and below Spurs.

So take three seasons. 7th place, 2nd place, 6th place. And what, like £212 for transfers? No trophies, one top 4 finish, and the best finish going out in the semis in the league and FA cups. It's really not that emotional. It's somewhat reasoned and logical. 

He had one of the best players in the world in Suarez, and rode that to 2nd.

null,false,junnies,null,null,null,"i feel like rodgers came to liverpool at the wrong time on two levels. 

on the first level, he's not experienced enough and despite being a talented manager, still has many things he has to learn. In ten year's time, Rodgers will probably become extremely good, but he hasn't reached that stage yet. I think even the most ardent rodgersout fans will acknowledge that you cannot fluke the two incredible unbeaten runs we had last season and in the middle of this one, and even the most ardent supporters of BR will acknowledge that he has some serious flaws as a manager

on the second level, the modern era and the modern (big club) fan expects immediate gratification and success. honestly, besides Mourinho, i'm not certain if any other manager would have pushed us to challenge consistently for top 4 after 3 seasons considering the squad BR started with.

ten or twenty years ago, or at a smaller club, I don't think rodgers would have been written off as a manager after one poor season. he would have been given time to learn and grow as a manager. but clearly, modern fans at big clubs want the world-class manager and the accompanying results now. one poor, underachieving season and people call for your head. 

Me, personally, I've grown accustomed to Liverpool not having much success after supporting the club for ten+ years. i'm perhaps more patient than the average fan and i'm okay with giving Rodgers time to learn and grow as a manager at the club because I see his talent as a manager and I think he is the sort who will stay with the club for a long time. I want Liverpool to be that kind of club who has faith in talented players/managers, gives them the time and space to grow, and reaps the rewards eventually.

But i'm speaking for myself, and my opinion is no more valuable than those of others. Some people think that modern football is so cut-throat that we cannot afford losing any time for a manager to grow and develop. Some people see Liverpool as a big club that should have a world-class manager at the helm and should settle for no less. I just think that, similar to Andre Villas Boas, BR is a flawed but talented manager, but unlike AVB, i don't think he has made the same mistakes(AVB crucially lost the dressing room) that warrants firing him.",null,0,null,1432483332,null,0,false,0,crjei8w,null,t3_373m86,null,t1_crjei8w,null,t3_373m86,null,null,null,1433241025,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

We still had horrible tactics last season, Suarez made up for it. And can you really say motivation was down to Rodgers? Honestly I think Gerrard was a bigger motivator, and Suarez was a world class striker everyone fed off of.

Look at Suarez's comments. He mentions Gerrard all the time. The reason he stayed instead of going to Arsenal? Gerrard. His favorite player to play with? Gerrard. He's playing for one of the biggest teams in the world yet still has a massive respect for Gerrard. I doubt Suarez is the only one on the team that feels that way.

null,false,helloindustries,,I don't have a bike,null,"Best buying advice is to take a qualified mechanic with you, preferably they'll be licensed to do MOTs and will know what to look for.

Or you could buy from a reputable dealer. Yes; You'll save money with a private purchase, but dealers offer warranties and bikes are properly checked-over etc...

Failing that:

* Make sure the bike is cold before it's started. A warm engine may be a sign that the seller is attempting to hide starting/running issues

* The state of the bike can often indicate the level of care and service it has received. A clean bike with little to no rust has likely been taken care of.

* Look at the service and MOT history. A lack of service history may indicate a 'have a go' mechanic, and that you may be in for potential issues. Likewise; An MOT history with either fails and retests or lots of advisories may indicate that either the bike has been neglected and/or work is only carried out when legally required. Both are bad.

* Mileage: Less than 50k and less than 10 years old.

* Go Japanese. 

* Ride the bike, or get a capable friend to do so.

* Document issues/lack thereof should raise some red-flags.

* Check the state of seals, brake pads etc. Make sure nothing is loose.

* Check that it's not stolen.

* Tyre tread should be at least 1mm deep across the width and total surface to be legal.

* Is the chain dry and rusty? That's bad. Are there links which stick up or down? Very bad. You may well need a new chain and sprocket kit.

* Non-standard stickers can often be used to hide damage or rust. 

---

Bargaining:

* Items which will need work are useful tools with which to knock the price down. Needs brake pads? £50 off the price. About to need an MOT? £30 off. Been sat for more than a few months? Money off for an inspection. Tyres need replacing immediately or soon? £150 off. You get the idea.

---

Other:

* Do NOT ride it home. Put it on a trailer or in a van. Take it to a garage either you or a biker friend trust for a check-over.

* Buy a GOOD chain and attach it to something immovable. Spending £100 on a damn good chain is acceptable.

* You will probably drop it. Shelling out for a pristine 125 is pointless unless you have money to burn.

* You'll also be looking to upgrade as soon as you're able, so a finance deal over more than 2 years is a bad idea.

* Remember that you'll have to tax and insure it. Factor those costs in to your search.",null,0,null,1432483472,null,0,false,0,crjekq3,null,t3_373ggz,null,t1_crjekq3,null,t3_373ggz,null,null,null,1433241057,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

null,false,junnies,null,null,null,"My Opinion on Rodgers:

i feel like rodgers came to liverpool at the wrong time on two levels.

on the first level, he's not experienced enough and despite being a talented manager, still has many things he has to learn. In ten year's time, Rodgers will probably become extremely good, but he hasn't reached that stage yet. I think even the most ardent rodgersout fans will acknowledge that you cannot fluke the two incredible unbeaten runs we had last season and in the middle of this one, and even the most ardent supporters of BR will acknowledge that he has some serious flaws as a manager

on the second level, the modern era and the modern (big club) fan expects immediate gratification and success. honestly, besides Mourinho, i'm not certain if any other manager would have pushed us to challenge consistently for top 4 after 3 seasons considering the squad BR started with.

ten or twenty years ago, or at a smaller club, I don't think rodgers would have been written off as a manager after one poor season. he would have been given time to learn and grow as a manager. but clearly, modern fans at big clubs want the world-class manager and the accompanying results now. one poor, underachieving season and people call for your head.

Me, personally, I've grown accustomed to Liverpool not having much success after supporting the club for ten+ years. i'm perhaps more patient than the average fan and i'm okay with giving Rodgers time to learn and grow as a manager at the club because I see his talent as a manager and I think he is the sort who will stay with the club for a long time. I want Liverpool to be that kind of club who has faith in talented players/managers, gives them the time and space to grow, and reaps the rewards eventually.

But i'm speaking for myself, and my opinion is no more valuable than those of others. Some people think that modern football is so cut-throat that we cannot afford losing any time for a manager to grow and develop. Some people see Liverpool as a big club that should have a world-class manager at the helm and should settle for no less. I just think that, similar to Andre Villas Boas, BR is a flawed but talented manager, but unlike AVB, i don't think he has made the same mistakes(AVB crucially lost the dressing room) that warrants firing him.
