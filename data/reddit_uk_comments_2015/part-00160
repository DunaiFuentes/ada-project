null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"Hmm; we keep running into this weird gender difference, much as we try to persuade ourselves that we're a ""post-feminist"" society (in the US, at any rate).  The qualities that make Clara more interesting and more ""real"" in S8 are her persistence and boldness in challenging the Doctor, her assertiveness and self-confidence, her confidence in pursuing what *she* wants instead of just following orders and serving the needs of others, her clever use of misdirection to achieve desired ends, boldness and self confidence (as in leadership qualities), and courage (sometimes to the point of recklessness).  Two points are striking about this:

First, it's very common in modern society to see the same qualities as positive in males but as negative in females: ""bold"" becomes ""pushy"", having your own goals in life becomes ""selfish"", using cleverness over brute force becomes ""manipulation"", tactical cunning becomes ""lying"", leadership becomes ""bossiness"", and courage becomes pretty much all of the above -- *if the person is female*. 

Second: it seems to me that these same qualities are also very much a part of the character of the Doctor himself: he's ""arrogant"", over-bearing, brilliantly manipulative, favors clever tactics over brute force, etc.  But in him, the same qualities are admirable.  When Clara was essentially a plot-mule (Moffat himself has admitted this) existing only to ""save"" the Doctor, she was either (and I quote many commenters here and elsewhere) ""just meh"", or wimpy.  When she acquired a mind and a life and some feelings of her own in S7-8, some viewers (myself included) began to find her a compelling and interesting character in her own right -- but others began to really ""hate"" her for somehow making DW into ""The Clara Show"" (nonsense -- see below).

Well, no; but it did become a ""two-hander"" in the sense that it went from a version of, say, the Lone Ranger and Tonto to a story about two well-developed lead characters sharpening and deepening their natures in both conflict and concert with each other.  That's called ""drama"", as opposed to the melodrama of the old action serials where neither the Lone Ranger nor Tonto could ever grow or change because they were only there in the first place to find a problem and fix it (usually with six-guns) and ride on to the next problem/fix it situation. NuWho in particular has aspired to be much more than just that, and in S8 especially achieved it.  Some folks would rather have their Lone Ranger back, so they blame Tonto, or they blame the writers and creative team for writing richer characters.

null,false,andycycles,null,null,null,"The UK is divided into 650 constituencies. A constituency is a geographic area which elects 1 MP (1 seat) into the House of Commons.

To win a seat in FPTP, you just need more votes than anybody else running in that constituency, which sounds fair enough. You get a local representative. Say that in one constituency X, Labour get 350 votes, Conservatives and Lib Dem 325 each. Labour win the seat with only a third of the votes, and two thirds of the votes(Conservative, Lib Dem) count for nothing and are wasted.

Say another constituency Y gets 900 Conservative votes and 100 Labour votes. The Conservative is rightly elected but they only needed 101 votes to win, so the other 799 votes also made no difference to the outcome. Labour effectively benefit as only 100 of their votes were wasted here. This is called a ""safe seat"" as there are a lot of Conservative minded voters here, so whoever stands for election as a Conservative is pretty much safe to win the seat over and over again.

A final constituency Z has 500 Conservative votes, 450 Lib Dem and 50 Labour. Conservative win. The Lib Dems have a lot of wasted votes here. Labour, again, have very few.

To add more seats let's add constituencies X2 and X3 which are identical to X. Labour win all three of these.

Taking these 5 hypothetical constituency results together you can start to see how this produces screwy results. The vote percentages are

- Labour 3 seats, 24% of the vote

- Conservative 2 seats, 48% of the vote

- Lib Dem 0 seats, 28% of the vote

You can see that this is arse-backwards. Labour had the **least** votes but got lucky with where their voters were, in marginal seats X, X2 and X3. This could be as a result of gerrymandering (the intentional changing of election boundaries for your benefit). The Conservatives had the most votes with a lot of votes in every constituency but were penalised because they had too many of their votes packed into two constituencies and the rest too spread out. The Lib Dems also had a stronger showing than the winning Labour but they were always #2 or #3 so got no seats at all!

Over a period of many elections any 3rd (or smaller) party slowly dies as its voters lose confidence and want a say in who gets elected so decide to tactically vote for one of the two main parties since they have a chance to win. However the Lib Dems do have some support concentrated in a few constituencies so they have a core of around 20 seats left. But most Lib Dem voters are in constituencies which elect someone else, so all those votes are wasted.

The Lib Dems have been underrepresented since the 80s(and before), have a watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSUKMa1cYHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSUKMa1cYHk) (The ""SDP-Liberal Alliance"" later became known as the Lib Dems, it's the same party)

Balo was terrible, every touch gave the ball away. Coutinho made some pretty moves but the play died at his feet, his teammates clearly have no faith in him to do anything other than razzle and then fizzle.

Sterling was utterly useless. Too much 1 on 11 nonsense. When he runs with the ball I don't think he ever takes his eye off it.",null,0,null,1430268860,null,0,false,0,cqs3x0s,null,t3_347217,null,t1_cqs3x0s,null,t3_347217,null,null,null,1432662801,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Do I have the right to have prenatal leave as a man? No. Not even if I have a sex change could I have that. There are rights that belong to a man, and rights that belong to a woman, and most of them are there for good reasons. And I can't complain about equality - why? Why can't I complain about equality here? Because, by the nature of this law, it simply doesn't apply to me. I am not equal to a woman capable of having a child in this situation, and I don't care. I don't want this right. As a comparison, this is quite different to marriage, because marriage can apply to both men and women, but the definition used to pertain to the union between a man and a woman. 

Now, here's the crux. Is a union between a man and a woman the same as a union between a man and a man, or a woman and a woman? No it's not, because there are different elements involved. Is the promise the same? Almost, yeah. And this is why most people think it's fine. But they disregard those who this will hurt. So why not go for the superior solution, which is government/legal recognition without using the name marriage. This doesn't create a controversy.

But I think you're actually missing the point a bit here.

The No campaign won the referendum using huge amounts of FUD to confuse everyone, because AV is not the easiest thing to understand. The majority of people I spoke to who voted No couldn't even explain to me how AV works or what the point of it is supposed to be. And it's true in the general population - the majority of people who voted were ignorant of the basic premise.

That said, it is simple enough when explained properly, but a) not many had it explained properly, and b) the No campaign put a lot more money into confusion and FUD than the Yes put into making it clear to everyone. Even the Yes leaflet I got through the door didn't particularly make me want to vote Yes it was so badly done, even though I was in favour of it!

To the point, though:

Most of the arguments made against AV and all of the other talking points simply don't work against PR.

It's first of all much simpler to explain, but also much harder to demonise. No one can try to undervalue what a ""vote"" is or claim that some people get ""2 votes"" and all the other shite that was going around. One of the few arguments that might still sway people is the whole ""it creates more coalitions"" - however look, we kept FPTP and it looks like we're going to have coalitions for some time now anyway, so that argument is also out the window.

Basically if there was a PR referendum it would have a much better chance at passing not because there's a huge number of people out there who currently and previously wanted PR in the AV campaign, but because once they actually learn about the difference between the 2 options at the time, there's a good chance the majority will pick PR.

Interestingly, coalitions make deals such as referendums on these things much more likely, as a way of attempting to get a policy through that they want without the other party having to fully commit to allowing it.

The reason the DUP has such a big voting base here isn't based 100% on their policies, some people vote just because they're Protestant and/or pro-Union regardless of their policies or what they stand for. People vote for UKIP based on their policies (mainly leaving Europe and their anti-immigration stance) and you're implying that if you vote UKIP you are a homophobe and racist even though they (the party) haven't publicly stated that they are against gay marriage and have been recently telling fascists not to vote for them. 

I'd say even UKIP aren't up to the standards of gay and race bashing that the DUP are at.

As for you saying ""voting in dinosaurs"" shows how left you are, in Northern Ireland those are the views of the people or the people they've elected. People in NI might not see their views as medieval and see yours a step to far in political correctness.

If you believe that then you've missed quite a bit, I think.

Suggesting that the rest of the UK is *far* more left wing is a stretch for sure, when you look at the Tories and New Labour.  When it comes down to it the UUP and DUP are the only right wing parties in Stormont, and if you look at their fiscal policies to be honest it only leaves the UUP (and as I've said before there's a difference between a bigot and a conservative).  Nobody really seems to vote very far left at all any more in England. 

All the polls tell us there is majority support in NI for same-sex marriage, adoption and the 1967 Abortion Act.  So yes while people may want the DUP in power it'll be thanks to one or two policies they really care about, not those issues they unfortunately feel don't affect them.  Nobody votes for the Tories for their stance on gay marriage, for example.

I do think UKIP and the DUP are closer than you're making out, though; if people are looking at their leaflets that come through the door, they both talk about a referendum on Europe, for example.  But when it comes down to it if people read their full manifesto a lot of their voters would think twice (how many of their policies have kept us closer in line with the Republic than Britain politically, for example).

null,false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"&gt; The Race Relations comment was to do with his idea that British employees should be able to employ Brits in preference to people from abroad. You might disagree with that concept (I do too), you might call it nationalist, yes, but racist? no. 

As I said at the time, Farage knows his party has an issue with being perceived as racist. Surely, around such a touchy issue as race relations, he would know to tread lightly and make himself extra-clear as to not appear racist? Apparently not. He seemed happy to blunder in and give vague assurances around the idea that UKIP isn't racist, so removing the race relations act would be fine.

&gt; The Eastern European thing: somewhat coerced, he said that, given the (statistically demonstrated) “high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain”, that “normal and fair-minded” people have a “right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly [move] in next door”. His comments where stupid and certainly misguided, but I don’t see them as necessarily racist. It depends largely on how you interpret the word “concerned”, and if you pay any attention to his implication in the word “suddenly”, I suppose.

National steriotypes are not OK. I could probably produce statistics that say black people commit more crimes, but if I went on the radio and said I wouldn't like to live next door to a group of black people, I'd rightly be chastised for it? Why is it OK to be prejudiced against Eastern Europeans?

&gt; The “You know what I mean” follow up was a response to what was effectively a trick question — a group of men vs. a family — really a false dichotomy designed to provoke an exploitable response. 

So why didn't he clarify himself by saying there is a difference between a group of men and a family? Why did he make his answer so vague?

&gt; Not sure what gay marriage has to do with racism.

I do think you're being a bit optimistic with a PR referendum though because there are so many variants all with their own quirks. Even if you strip it down to as simple as you can get it, it's still going to get bashed by arguments that you won't have a local MP, crazy minority parties will get seats, lists put power in the hands of political bureaucrats and unstable government like you mentioned.



So that's quite a big chunk of the arguments used last time and some new ones too. I think making a massive deal about not being able to vote for a local MP and so having the MP's decided for you could be made to sound evil enough to make up for loosing some of the complexity of AV.


Not to mention that a lot of people just dislike change, especially when you're threatening something thats ""good old-fashioned"" and ridiculously simplistic.


So really I can't see even a very good PR campaign winning a referendum in the foreseeable future. The only way I think that would happen is if Labour and the Conservatives threw all their power and money fully behind a Yes vote, in effect starving the No vote leaving it poor and run by fringe elements. And thats not going to happen. 


As a side note I do want to see a form of PR introduced, but I think the only hope is that a Labour government, probably with Lib Dem support just passes it through the Commons some time in the future, and I really don't know how realistic that is.

Sherwood just decided to throw about 7 attackers to try to solve the problem. It worked, but of course, we were frantic and terrible in the back. 

Poch has tried to create/find versatile midfielders that can add to the attack and play a pressing defense.  Unfortunately, the game hinges entirely on their play. That's a lot for two really young talents who just can't do everything they're being asked to do.  

The answer remains better players. We have to play essentially 3 CAMs because we can't find legitimate attacking talents.

&gt; The [Gini index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income. In the US it is 45.0 while in the UK it is 32.3

45/32.3 = a 39.32% increase from UK to US.

Just to note, Gini coefficients aren't perfect at measuring income inequality. Take a look at the example on the [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient#Limitations_of_Gini_coefficient):

| Household group   | Annual Income of Country A    | Annual Income of Country B     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| 1        |          £20,000 |     £9,000     
| 2  |    £30,000 |  £40,000   
| 3       |        £40,000 |   £48,000
| 4        |          £50,000 |     £48,000     
| 5  |    £60,000 |  £55,000   
| Total Income  |    £200,000 |  £200,000   
| Gini Coefficient       |        0.2 |   0.2

Countries that have the same measure of wealth equality (Gini coefficient), with the same total income, can vary in where their income is distributed. There is a case for Country B here being a much more unequal society (the poorest household group are so far behind the next poorest household group, relative poverty is higher) even though it's Gini coefficient is the same as Country A's.",null,0,null,1430274547,null,0,false,0,cqs79gg,null,t3_346eic,null,t1_cqs79gg,null,t1_cqs4wbv,null,null,null,1432664377,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I'm sceptical of this potential signing. Firstly, is the thing we really need another young, fast winger/attacking midfielder given we have Raheem, Ibe, Markovic, Coutinho, Lallana and Origi?
He's the top scorer in Holland but it's a much weaker league, and he's playing for one of the top two teams already, so there's Ajax who are probably better than them and that's it.
Theres then also the factor that Dutch signings tend to take a bit longer to settle down in the BPL than others, even King Luis did, as in sure people have commented a million times already.

I'm from Brazil and our system here is crazy and I don't like it. From what I've understood about Britain I quite admire it. I like how each MP is actually local and is supposed to advocate both for national issues and local ones.

What I find most intriguing is the proportional representation discussion. Isn't fptp and constituencies set up to avoid the concept of ""tyranny of the majority""? Because for instance here in Brazil for president you have direct votes for each candidate and parliament is voted for separately. At our last presidential election the current president won by a very narrow margin, and it stirred controversy for her vote share was greater in the north of the country, areas that seen loads of development and improvement over the last decade her party has been ruling, and were largely ignored by the opposition who ruled for 10 years before, which in turn had strong results in the south. Thing is the south has more people, so in the vote share they could essentially outnumber the people in the north. The workers party still won, but I believe that if our system was divided into constituencies like in Britain, even though the number of people voting would be similar, she would have won more comfortably, for the minorities and deprived areas in the north would be better represented. This would give her government more stability for the rightwing press wouldn't be dismissing the votes poor people gave her because they earn benefits. Anyway, I think you get the point.

I think my reasoned defence is that obviously the negotiators failed on sanchez, on remy. couldn't get origi this season, so splashed in a panic on balo. teams dont win games without good strikers. secondly, i think our positioning this season has been down to a lot of stupid individual errors this season, which is something more difficult to stop. I'm starting to doubt, but i've always loved rodgers teams when they're in form and playing well. we also have a lot of young talent. they may not have shown it all yet, but marko, sterling, coutinho, ibe, can could become genuine worldclass  players. migs has most clean sheets, lovren looks better. top 4 striking options: aguero, dzeko, jovetic, bony. Rvp, rooney, falcao. diego costa, loic remy, didier drogba. Even harry kane, soldado and adebayor are better than balo, borini, sterling, injured sturridge. Rodger categorically said they wouldn't sign balo, and considering he doesn't fit the playstyle, i think it was forced upon him. Considering the position we are in with pretty much no striker, sterling being top scorer is amazing.

null,false,reddit_crunch,cnty-uk,Urffling,null,"&gt;  a damaging drug which pollutes our beautiful field with noise, litter and N2O gas (a greenhouse gas which is 298 times more polluting than carbon dioxide). Nitrous oxide is also dangerous: an exploding canister was the source of a major injury at last year’s Glastonbury.

i) worried about noise at a music festival? i've been to glasto a fair few times, this is an absurd concern. if you want silence, stay at home or put some ear plugs in.

ii) littering with the little canisters and balloons is a shitty thing to do. although leaving a large bin specially for those is a much more realistic way of dealing with this.

iii) nitrous oxide gas, in it's use as a recreational drug has practically zero impact on the environment. http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/n2o.html. that's just fear-mongering.

iv) the larger pressurised containers should be treated with care but not really a great concern if the proper care is taken. really care about safety, set up a nitrous bar/lounge.

as far as drugs go, nitrous is pretty benign. the high is generally pleasant and intense. also, you're back to normal functioning state in a matter of minutes. makes auditory stimulus especially rich. meanwhile risk of chemical dependence is non-existent. psychological addiction is always a risk with anything, bacon and coca cola are the dragons i'm forever chasing (not at the same time).

obviously do your research if you are going to partake, erowid is a great resource. don't over do it, crazy high intake is associated with b12 depletion and in some folks, if you really take it to really stupid levels, it has been possibly associated with nerve damage. also the whippet cannisters aren't great, because they usually have residue which you're better off without, so use medical grade stuff if you can get your hands on it or at the very least something to filter your intake. don't use masks with tanks, and use in a well ventilated room if inside. it can make some few people feel a bit queasy and prone to upchucking.

nitrous is like being on a rollercoaster anyway, fun every once in a while. like most of our drug policies, it's daft that it isn't more accepted publicly while other far more dangerous drugs are. nitrous was all the rage for long time in the uk: william james thoughts from 1882: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml

http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/08/06/o-excellent-air-bag-humphry-davy-and-nitrous-oxide/

don't let the old biddy and her woo, scare you out of a great experience, but don't be a dumbass when using it. i should add, it's legal status is:

[""Nitrous oxide is not illegal to possess, but this doesn’t mean that it is safe to use. It is illegal, in England and Wales, for anyone to sell nitrous oxide to people under-18, if they think they’re likely to be inhaling the nitrous oxide.""](http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/nitrous-oxide)

Some of that is beyond his control, like with certain transfers being foisted on him, but he overall seems better suited to working with players on the training ground and when things are going well in games. 

He's long had a bad habit of waiting too long to make substitutions or change formations when things are against us. There was a statistic in the sub today saying that of the 9 times we've gone behind first in a game, only once have we come back to win this season. That says to me that he has an issue adapting to situations in-game, which is weird because he's good about changing his plan match to match, like with the 3-4-3 or the 4-4-2 diamond last season. 

I appreciate the difficulties in losing Suarez and Sturridge and most of Mario's problems are Rodgers' fault. That being said, we know that the 3 Southampton boys were his choice and they've all underwhelmed badly. Markovic cost 20m and he's hardly been played at all, let along in his proper position. Emre Can is a boss player but he's trapped at CB where he struggles because we don't have a working system or good personnel. All in all Rodgers does have a lot to answer for with this season, but my bigger concern is that I don't see him turning it around over the summer or next season. It would be silly to say that Suarez was solely responsible for last season, but it does seem now that Rodgers was far more reliant on him than we realised.

As you can see, the Liberal Democrats got 23% of the vote, yet they only got 57 seats out of 650. Under PR they would have had 150. Under FPTP, the two main parties (Labour and Conservative) get far more seats than they deserve, while all the other parties get far fewer. UKIP got zero seats, despite 3% of the vote. Under PR, they would have had 20.

In other words, the million people who voted UKIP have no representation. As they are mostly right wing voters, they would have been better off voting conservative. This is the problem with FPTP, it discourages people from voting with their hearts and so they vote strategically instead.

You're right that one of the hidden advantages of FPTP is that you're voting for someone from your area, directly chosen by the locals. The AV system was supposed to keep this advantage while allowing people to vote for who they like most instead of who has the best chance to win. 

For example, the majority of Lib Dem voters would have voted Labour otherwise and vice versa, as they are the left wing parties. If the two parties were one, 52% of people would have voted labour and we would not have a conservative government right now.

The advantage with PR is that whoever you vote for, your vote counts. Under FPTP, if you're a labour voter in [Haltemprice and Howdem](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/b96.stm), you might as well not bother voting. This is a ""safe seat"" of the conservatives, where they will always win no matter what. At least under PR, your vote is added to the final tally of labour votes, and that 0.00001% of the vote means something.

So in the UK we have a situation in which many people don't bother to vote, either because their party won't get any seats despite considerable support, or because the result in their area is already innevitable. Choosing to vote for say, UKIP, only makes it easier for Labour to win, and voting Lib Dem/Green only makes it easier for the conservatives to win. Everybody is fed up with this system (except possibly conservative loyalists, who consistently benefit from left wing voters throwing their votes away on the Lib Dems/Greens/SNP).",null,0,null,1430284343,null,0,false,0,cqsc76a,null,t3_34755a,null,t1_cqsc76a,null,t1_cqs9nsr,null,null,null,1432666775,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Plus the TUV are running a stronger candidate than last time which might make the swing required even less. Being held partly responsible for McCrea losing his seat is about as much as the TUV can hope to achieve in this election. 

Meanwhile, unlike last time, the UUP selected early this time and have been working much harder on the seat.

The seat's been UUP in the recent past (Burnside).

I'd argue that the question (for us) is more about who do they weaken by taking their keeper.  If they take Cech off Chelsea's hands, they get a decent keeper, but they don't weaken a direct opponent.  With us, it's twofold benefit to them.


&gt; Are you arguing that we shouldn't buy new players at all then? I'm confused by what you mean.

No, not at all... I'm just saying that the thinking around ""selling our best player gives us lots of money to play with"" never actually works out.  We sold Berbatov, Carrick, Modric and Bale... and we still haven't adequately replaced any of them, even years later.

For a team in our position, for whom buying a Sanchez or Ozil or Di Maria isn't an option, selling a world class player makes it only more unlikely you'll land more world class players in their place.  Because people join teams because they want to play with Bale, or whoever... but top talent aren't gonna run to us to play with Ryan Mason.


&gt; Ideally, we wouldn't have to sell our best asset. I would have loved to keep Bale and would like to not sell Lloris, but that's probably not an option.

We can't realistically keep hold of Lloris forever (in fact, I'd already put money on him going this summer for sure), but we don't have to sell to domestic competitors, who will only make it harder for us to clamber into 4th place in the long run.

&gt;I'm just saying that the thinking around ""selling our best player gives us lots of money to play with"" never actually works out.  

That's not the thinking though.  We aren't choosing to sell our best players.  We just don't have a choice.  The guys you mentioned wanted to leave.  And if we can't keep them, it stands to reason we should get the most amount of value for them.  Whether or not we are able to take those funds and immediately use them successfully is completely irrelevant. (btw,  the Bale money did bring in Eriksen and Chadli.  Chadli is solid and Eriksen is on his way to being  great player) 

Also,  keep in mind that all those ex-players you mentioned were players we bought from other clubs.  The money we used to buy them came in part from other players we sold. 

&gt;but we don't have to sell to domestic competitors, who will only make it harder for us to clamber into 4th place in the long run.  I'd much rather sell Lloris at a loss to PSG than make a shitload of money selling him to Utd.

Except Lloris at United wouldn't make a difference though.  That's my point! They are not getting weaker at the GK position because they have the ability to buy a world class replacement if De Gea leaves. 

Now, if we are 100% sure that Cech won't go to Man U and there are no other A Level goalkeepers available for them, then I'll agree we shouldn't sell Lloris to United.  But, I'm pretty sure Chelsea will be willing to move Cech to Manchester and if not, I've read that are great keepers available from Germany as well.  

With all that in mind, it makes no sense for us to leave money on table.  **Man U will be the same with or without our involvement**, but we could have significantly more funds at our disposal if we're the ones they do business with.  

Unless you just don't want the emotional heartache of seeing Hugo play in Red (which is a totally fair opinion to have), it makes sense to leave United as an option from an objective perspective.

Large increases in support for the Greens, Socialists and other third parties *will* shift Labour to the left again. Indeed, the SNP's rise will surely swing labour left in future elections (it's too late for labour to turn now in this election).

Since the 80s, the conservatives dramatically shifted their position to the left on things like gay marriage, religion and the environment, as a direct result of their previous positions having become untenable in an increasingly liberal society. 

Political parties are still beholden to the electorate. The business-friendliness of the major parties, whether you like it or not, mirror an electorate that really does kinda like it that way, even while we grumble about it. 

Niel Kinnock ran a Labour party committed to leftist ideals, and people never bought into it. Tony Blair's business- friendly New Labour on the other hand was triumphant in 3 elections.

For me, I'd like to see him develop his right foot into something he can rely on as evidenced by how he uses it. As it stands now, his right boot is primarily used only to push the ball forward, not to shoot, not to evade with any guile.  I can't recall the game, but Lamela's positioning was with the ball on the right of the 6 yard box at an angle trying to round the defender near the end line. Instead of using his outside (right) foot to work the ball around the defender, he pushed the ball past and, using the outside of his left boot (his inside foot with the ball more exposed to a tackle), tapped it to the left. In this case, he got the ball around and made quite a nice play, but the success of the play hides a fault that needs quite a bit of work.  

It's possible this unorthodoxy is part of his skill/ability that catches defenders off guard, but I'm unconvinced of this. He simply has no confidence in his right foot when it comes to any skill move.  Watch the Rabona shot again. It is an amazing shot... an amazing shot that he attempted because he was more confident with a lefty Rabona (at 20 damn yards!!!!) than shooting with his right boot from an angle that was begging for it.",null,0,null,1430289239,null,0,1430289959,0,cqse01l,null,t3_3470l6,null,t1_cqse01l,null,t3_3470l6,null,null,null,1432667624,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Hobbies.... hmm... I stay at home quite a bit.  Play games at home. Big user of the internet; downloading TV to watch in binges rather than watching broadcasts.  I make alcohol but that's mostly because alcohol is so expensive here, that might change in England, but then again if I had access to a whole lot of fruit I might make something out of it.. but then I would need to get all new equipment.  

I enjoy cooking and I host dinner parties every couple of weeks, but continuing that requires making friends first. I go running. I like to build furniture or repair old free-and-unwanted furniture at times. I don't know, I'm bit boring I guess =)   I would like to go camping occasionally, maybe get back into cycling again. 

I do drive, and enjoy it a lot. Having a car in Australia is almost a necessity with distances and the expense of PT, which I probably wouldn't need to remind you of if you have spent time here.

&gt;The word ___fascist___ is sometimes used to denigrate people, institutions, or groups that would not describe themselves as [ideologically fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism), and that may not fall within the formal definition of the word. [The Fascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fascist_Party) that developed in Italy in the 1920s rigidly enforced conservative values and behavior norms during the Mussolini regime. As a political epithet, *fascist* was subsequently used in an [anti-authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-authoritarianism) sense to emphasize the common ideology of governmental suppression of individual freedom. It has also been applied to a broad range of people and groups, including people of many [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) faiths, particularly [fundamentalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_fundamentalism) groups. The individual, institution, or group(s) called fascist often find the use of the term in this way to be highly offensive and inappropriate.

A big thing working in AV's favor is the game between Sunderland and Leicester. Both teams are fighting that relegation battle and see salvation at the expense of the other. Both teams *really* need to win that game to have the points to survive and the brilliant thing is that the loser of the game will probably be the one sent down. Neither team has the favorable games remaining on their schedule to recover those lost points... Reasonable best case scenario for both teams is probably an additional four points. That would put Sunderland at 34 and Leicester at 35. Of course, they're only getting these point totals by ensure the other doesn't.

If Sunderland ends up on the losing side of the game they're reasonably topping out at 32 points to finish the season which mean AV just needs to pick up a single tie to beat them. 

There is always the chance Sunderland picks up an oddity win against Everton or Southampton so AV still has to be on guard and pick up some points...

We've been extremely poor LATELY because we lost to United and Gerrard got a red the moment he got on. Sterling's situation became international news (seriously, in the states you don't ever hear about this stuff but it was even talked about in serious publications like the New Yorker) and obviously has effected his play and likely the emotions of his teammates (it also has made Liverpool contracts main page news for absolutely no reason. Skrtel, Hendo, and others have all had their contracts become major news because Liverpool falling off a cliff became the media spin). Then we lose to Arsenal in a match that really could have been ours if he finished two chances but got completely blown open after that. We lose to Villa and everyone continues to pile on the pressure and the news stories.

The thing is this shit happens. Everyone loses their minds and the media loves it because it's clickbait. And unfortunately the internet doesn't exist in a vacuum. If we think that we should just look to how some of our own players (Lucas, Balotelli, Sterling, etc) have responded back to criticism on places like Twitter and Instagram. 

So yeah, we're fading fast, but I'm hardly going to blame Brendan for having no good striker in our side. That's on the committee. Anyone who argues he wanted Balotelli did not follow last summer at all. Rodgers also isn't an idiot. He knows Balotelli wasn't cut out for our system. Have you ever seen a player signed where the club and it's manager make a bunch of statements (or leaks) about how the player has to agree to act in a certain manner (the Liverpool way) in order to stay at the club. It's unheard of.


So if I say 5th is par for Liverpool, then the question becomes where do we go from here? How do we escape this situation. The answer is pretty simply that we're going to have to overachieve sometimes. We're going to need to do that next for sure, unless FSG splash cash, which I don't foresee. We're going to need to ""grow"" into a CL and title contender.

But the thing is...we CAN do that. That's why you sign Emre Can. That's why you sign Coutinho. That's why, even, you spend a lot of money relatively speaking on kids like Sterling and Ibe from their respective former employers. 

Do we have holes we need to fill in the summer? Absolutely. But we also have probably gone from a season where we had incredible luck to a season where we had no luck at all. And if you adjust for that, I think we're still moving upward. 

No one likes to see what's happening to us now, but some of you lot need to remember that it's all just fresh in your mind. You don't remember the pathetic losses and lifeless displays we had under Rafa where we played hoofball to Peter Crouch and hoped something would fucking happen. You remember the moments of glory. 

Ultimately, we'll do that for Rodgers too. Anyone who thinks he should go is going to eat his hat in a few years when Rodgers is given the proper time with a side and wins shit. While so many on this thread may be fickle, most people in the football world haven't forgotten what Rodgers pulled off last year with a squad with much less upward mobility than we have now. 

Right now we're basically playing for pride, which is tough, but I don't think playing in the EL next season is as bad as everyone else thinks because we actually have a squad deep enough to offer serious chances to players who might otherwise have to sit the bench. Players who could seize time in the EL but likely wouldn't sniff a starting spot in the CL. 

Long story short, we're where we deserve to be right now. The question is whether FSG will actually pony up for a striker who isn't just potential in the summer. I certainly hope so.",null,0,null,1430292316,null,0,false,0,cqsevdm,null,t3_348zps,null,t1_cqsevdm,null,t3_348zps,null,null,null,1432668034,null,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2,null

&gt;It is impossible for countries such as the US and the UK, which borrow in their own currencies, to experience Greek-style crises, because they cannot run out of money – they can always print more. Even within the eurozone, borrowing costs plunged once the European Central Bank began to do its job and protect its clients against self-fulfilling panics by standing ready to buy government bonds if necessary. As I write this, Italy and Spain have no trouble raising cash – they can borrow at the lowest rates in their history, indeed considerably below those in Britain – and even Portugal’s interest rates are within a whisker of those paid by HM Treasury.

___

&gt;I don’t know how many Britons realise the extent to which their economic debate has diverged from the rest of the western world – the extent to which the UK seems stuck on obsessions that have been mainly laughed out of the discourse elsewhere. George Osborne and David Cameron boast that their policies saved Britain from a Greek-style crisis of soaring interest rates, apparently oblivious to the fact that interest rates are at historic lows all across the western world. The press seizes on Ed Miliband’s failure to mention the budget deficit in a speech as a huge gaffe, a supposed revelation of irresponsibility; meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is talking, seriously, not about budget deficits but about the “fun deficit” facing America’s children.

___

&gt;By late 2008 it was already clear in every major economy that conventional monetary policy, which involves pushing down the interest rate on short-term government debt, was going to be insufficient to fight the financial downdraft. Now what? The textbook answer was and is fiscal expansion: increase government spending both to create jobs directly and to put money in consumers’ pockets; cut taxes to put more money in those pockets.

&gt;But won’t this lead to budget deficits? Yes, and that’s actually a good thing. An economy that is depressed even with zero interest rates is, in effect, an economy in which the public is trying to save more than businesses are willing to invest. In such an economy the government does everyone a service by running deficits and giving frustrated savers a chance to put their money to work. Nor does this borrowing compete with private investment. **An economy where interest rates cannot go any lower is an economy awash in desired saving with no place to go, and deficit spending that expands the economy is, if anything, likely to lead to higher private investment than would otherwise materialise**.

&gt;It’s true that you can’t run big budget deficits for ever (although you can do it for a long time), because at some point interest payments start to swallow too large a share of the budget. But it’s foolish and destructive to worry about deficits when borrowing is very cheap and the funds you borrow would otherwise go to waste.

&gt;At some point you do want to reverse stimulus. But you don’t want to do it too soon – specifically, **you don’t want to remove fiscal support as long as pedal-to-the-metal monetary policy is still insufficient. Instead, you want to wait until there can be a sort of handoff, in which the central bank offsets the effects of declining spending and rising taxes by keeping rates low**.

I'm completely with you on quality signings though. An unbeatable up and commer or an  already established worldie is vital. Do we have the clout though? My fear is the TC, to say they don't fill me with confidence is a huge understatement. If we don't sign big though I still wouldn't fire Rodgers because then the lack of ambition comes from above and we wouldn't be able to break the strangle hold on the big boys anyway. 

I'm sure this may sound like I'm a Rodgers fan boy but I really haven't seen enough negativity from him to warrant his head.

&gt;The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb through 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-4 (also known as RFRA), is a 1993 United States federal law that ""ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected.""[1] The bill was introduced by Congressman Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on March 11, 1993. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-MA) the same day. A unanimous U.S. House and a nearly unanimous U.S. Senate—three senators voted against passage[2]—passed the bill, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

&gt;The RFRA was held unconstitutional as applied to the states in the City of Boerne v. Flores decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress's enforcement power. However, it continues to be applied to the federal government—for instance, in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal—because Congress has broad authority to carve out exemptions from federal laws and regulations that it itself has authorized. In response to City of Boerne v. Flores and other related RFR issues, twenty individual states have passed State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that apply to state governments and local municipalities.[3]",null,0,null,1430296587,null,0,false,0,cqsfvj7,null,t3_346fvm,null,t1_cqsfvj7,null,t1_cqsfufj,null,null,null,1432668507,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I'm not really sure this is true. They seem positioned reasonably well to me. Souhampton have reasonably clean position. If thy were positioned as you suggested than they would be an easy Target for balls in behind.

&gt; GIF 2: CBs don't communicate &amp; go with same man.

This just isn't true. Are you suggesting that one of them should leave pelle therefore giving pelle a clear run at the back/front post? That's exactly what they shouldn't be doing

&gt; GIF 3: Fazio misjudges flight/is wrong side/is wea

Hmm I think this is an example of outcome bias on your part. Fazio doesn't do amazingly well but he still wins the ball. If mason had done his job there wouldn't have been a problem.

With regards the fifth gif he doesn't want to give Mane a clear run in behind him. If he wasn't on a yellow he could have just rushed out and fouled Pelle but he was at that stage do his decision making was reasonable Imo

With regards the vocal/ commanding centre backs part - we have the former club captains of Ajax and Sevilla in there, they are hardly shrinking violets. To suggest that if we had more vocal CBs Ryan Mason would learn the very basics of how to play central midfield is a pretty extraordinary logical leap.

And it's not just Masons pressing being a problem. As this piece shows, it's just basic defensive positioning and tracking of runs. If it was Capoue or Dembele failing to track these runes I'd be interested to see what you would have to say....

Put simply you seem to be attempting to play down Masons issues by listing minor to non-existent CB errors, it's like you've almost watched the gifs of Mason making mistakes and then actively tried to find some errors from our Cbs that don't really exist. I usually like you writing but Its this sort of analysis which comes across as very biased that is why your losing your credibility in the eyes of many Spurs fans

At the end of the three years, the total amount I have is £115,000. Now I decide to bring this amount to the UK.

If not having a right that you want means being treated as second-class, then we're all subject to that. If there is a union recognized by law, then I don't see where the problem is. 

There's a deeper issue here. Christ taught separation of church and state. This is why me, as a Christian, cannot oppose same-sex unions. It's for the state to decide, not the church or it's beliefs/laws. Now, the state has borrowed from the church, the term marriage, and has put some of that belief into law. But the religious rites were kept separate. If same-sex couples want legality, they can campaign for it and the people should decide. If they want to change the definition of marriage, that came from Christianity, then of course that is not an option. But there are Christians that fear this change, because they see the term marriage being thrown around, and think that the law will impose on their beliefs and perhaps try to change them.

They also play nice football, do develop the odd home-grown talent, lovely stadium, and despite the massive internet following etc (which I'm not really bothered by), the few fans I know from Southampton are always OK with me and Saints and not up their arse like some Man United fans I know (though that is more personal experience, it still has an effect on how you view a club).  

I also used to have a soft spot for Liverpool quite a bit, because I've got family who are avid Liverpool fans who I'm quite close to, and the support rubs off on you (they're also all quite fond of Saints, especially as they live in the South). Plus when they had Gerrard and Torres in form they were great to watch, Torres was such an amazing player, such an attacking player and way of playing, watching him was an absolute pleasure.

He's hardly beyond reproach. As I see it the man receives unremitting, universal criticism of one form or another. Sometimes they're legitimate counter-arguments or decronstructions of flaws in his arguments, but often they're just witless attacks on his character. It's the latter I resent.

&gt;For someone who is so outspoken about various key political issues you would think he make the effort to understand them at the very least

I mean, we clearly differ here, but I get the feeling he is making a huge effort. In the space of a very short time he's gone from a comedian / comedy actor to demonstrating a passionate political interest. He's sought the opinions of experts in their fields. He may be making all manner of mistakes, but I don't think anybody is letting him off for doing so. I think that's good, surely.

&gt;His verbose style disguises the fact he has little to knowledge or opinions on any subjects and indeed ratifies this fact by him publicly telling people not to vote. 

I do find his delivery off-putting. But plenty don't. And judging by the consistency of his style from his early stand-up, to his writing, to his public speaking, to his political commentary, I'd suggest it's just how he comports himself.

They can also be a problem in AV; for an extremely simple example, read through [this](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/tactical-voting-can-still-occur-under-the-alternative-vote-and-it-may-lead-to-unexpected-outcomes/) blog post, or read the explanation from the Australian guy somewhere else in this comment section.

&gt;The second round is a re run presuming the less popular candidate of a given stripe never ran.

I'm aware of how AV works. Even if the supposed elimination of tactical voting from the first round showed that 5% of the country supported the Greens, other than a few stronghold areas, they would very regularly not be in the running for getting seats. They would still be seen as fringe by many on the right and in the centre.

&gt; On the other side of the ledger, the benefits of improved confidence failed to make their promised appearance. Since the global turn to austerity in 2010, **every country that introduced significant austerity has seen its economy suffer**, with the depth of the suffering closely related to the harshness of the austerity.

The company I work for has grown by 25% since 2010. Far more of my friends are in steady, full-time employment than in 2010. In 2009, our business park was 75% empty. There is currently one open unit, with the rest filled by a combination of new tenants and existing tenants expanding. Yeah, some of the drop in unemployment is down to people being underemployed with a few shifts a week on zero-hours contracts, but equally I know a lot of people who have moved off that into full-time employment since 2010. Graduating in 2008 was shit as far as job seeking went. But everything I'm seeing and hearing is telling me that graduating right now is much less so. And this is in the Midlands - not London or South East. The last 5 years have been good for our economy. Regionally at least.

Maybe there was a better route than austerity that would have been *better*, but there were also a bunch of ways it could have gone much, much worse.

He's also heavily cherry-picking his quotes - he says in 2012 the IMF issued a ""mea culpa"" saying they should not have encouraged austerity.

Yet he neglects to mention (how careless!) that just a couple of weeks ago, the [IMF *praised* Osborne for his fiscal policy](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/17/imf-chief-praises-british-governments-handling-of-economy) and running of the Treasury stating that it was clearly showing results! Shock horror, you can't steer a super-tanker quickly, and the same applies to a nation's economy.

In 2012, their policies would not have had time to come into effect - lots of legacy spending and commitments running on that Labour signed us up for (some of which are still going, such as the new carriers which the Tories are stuck with on their balance sheet).

What's become more apparent since 2012 (now that we've *given those policies a chance to actually do something*), is that they have in fact worked reasonably well.

Maybe there was a even better route. That doesn't matter, because it's done now.

Graduating in 2008 was shit as far as job seeking went. But everything I'm seeing and hearing is telling me that graduating right now is much less so. And this is in the Midlands - not London or South East. The last 5 years have been good for our economy. Regionally at least.*

If you look at the GDP graph for the UK, you can see that we had a crash in 2007, then after the crash we've had (mostly) continuous growth, but at a much lower trend rate than the one seen in the decades before the crash.

By contrast, if you look at the US, they had the crash, then post crash their GDP growth continued at the pre-crash rate, with the result that their economy is now significantly larger than it was pre crash. Equally, if you look at Greece, Spain et al, they’ve all suffered horribly.

The argument Krugman is making is that you can make a strong link between these results and the amount of austerity forced on these economies. The US essentially didn’t do austerity, and has recovered strongly, the UK did austerity 'lite', where the government cut spending but not to the bone, with consequent lower post crash growth &amp; those countries forced into full-on austerity have suffered terribly.

So, yes Osborne's chosen route was not the worst possible one - but neither was it the optimal course by a long way. It represents a pointless, self-inflicted decrease in the GDP that we could have had which will affect many people for the rest of their lives.

Because they think its necessary. You have set up a false dilemma where one doesn't exist. Just because they want to reduce spending doesn't mean they won't still spend on things they think are important.

Fine debate the extent to which you agree with that judgement but this question is not a clever one.

null,false,dageshi,null,null,null,"I firmly believe Austerity was a good idea in the early years of this parliament and here's why.

The financial crisis wasn't a normal recession, in a normal recession the private sector is contracting but government finances and governments ability to borrow remain sound, in a normal recession what Krugman argues is perfectly fine. But the financial crisis wasn't normal. The government had already bailed out/backed the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of pounds and had expanded government debt hugely to do so. Add to that in europe countries were seeing their debt costs spiral out of control until they needed to be bailed out. Again that's not something that happens in a normal recession.

So in that situation you're effectively running out of capacity to deal with additional crises and you're seeing a massive crisis looming in the form of the euro, your ability to deal with another financial crisis is severely limited, investors and the general public are skittish at best.

So what do you do? If you do what Krugman suggests maybe everthing turns out fine, but maybe it doesn't, maybe investors look at the new British Government and think ""they're too weak to get their house in order, they can't get the budget under control even if they want too, the political will isn't there"", and so they start pulling out. Sure we have our own currency, we'll never default but that doesn't mean we can control how much the pound is worth, if foreign investors begin to flee then so ultimately will UK based investors, they'll see the pound declining and try to get out, a trickle turns into a torrent and eventually you run out of currency reserves and you're really fucked.

The electorate proved they could elect politicians that could take difficult decisions, the politicians proved they could implement austerity and most importantly, I think a significant part of the electorate agreed with austerity for just these reasons, they wanted someone to get control of things, that was the mood of the country at the time.

Clearly there's correlation here, but we have to be careful about inferring causation. It could be that the cuts are what later spurred our economy to grow, or it could be that the cuts were holding back our economy from growth and that stopping them has allowed it to flourish. 

The thrust of the article is that yes, we have seen growth in the last few years, but that it is because austerity was stopped, not because austerity happened - which is one of the two possibilities I suggested above (there is another possibility, that the economic growth was not affected by the cuts at all and other forces caused it, but we can't really argue that one).

Chart 2 cited in the article shows the relative growths of advanced economies according to the harshness of their austerity. The majority of these economies which were less austere grew faster than the UK. That's certainly *evidence* that less austerity means greater growth. The IMF praising Osborne's policy is evidence that the IMF thinks he made the right decision. The IMF's ""mea culpa"" is evidence that the IMF has in the past thought he made the wrong decision. The fact that many other advanced economies are not encouraging austerity (if true) is evidence that Britain is going against the common economic wisdom.

What's certain is that is is entirely *not* apparent that the route Osborne took was a positive one.

Re: your points...

&gt; I'm not really sure this is true. They seem positioned reasonably well to me. Souhampton have reasonably clean position. If thy were positioned as you suggested than they would be an easy Target for balls in behind.

No, they're not. They're looking to play Mane offside *anyway*, so they could be a lot higher and restrict the space. That doesn't excuse both midfielders getting caught ahead of the ball, but it would help combat it.

&gt; This just isn't true. Are you suggesting that one of them should leave pelle therefore giving pelle a clear run at the back/front post? That's exactly what they shouldn't be doing 

I'm suggesting that Vertonghen - goal side - tells Fazio ""I've got Pelle"" and then Fazio can marshall the space between Pelle and Davis. 

&gt; Hmm I think this is an example of outcome bias on your part. Fazio doesn't do amazingly well but he still wins the ball. If mason had done his job there wouldn't have been a problem.

I wasn't mentioning Mason because I was talking about the CBs. It goes without saying that Mason should track Davis, but Fazio is at fault as much as Mason. 

&gt; With regards the fifth gif he doesn't want to give Mane a clear run in behind him. If he wasn't on a yellow he could have just rushed out and fouled Pelle but he was at that stage do his decision making was reasonable Imo

When the ball is played, Vertonghen should be touch tight to Pelle and able to make a challenge.

&gt;
&gt;__Porth Llaffan__ is a port town in *IX* south of Alltrades Abbey. The villagers are fed and protected by the Lleviathan, who turned out to be Jona Jones's father. . It is located on the southern coast of Newid Isle. Tywll Cave and Cuddiedig Cliff can only be accessed through the west exit of this town. Ferries run between here and Slurry Quay. Porth Llaffan is named after the god that lives in the water there called the Lleviathan, who the villagers worship.

He's had an incredibly difficult task this season.

My main criticism is that it took him until Christmas to develop a system that worked for us, and then I don't understand why he hanged it once more when we faultered. 

Last season when the papers were writing about other clubs being interested in him were all saying ""He's the most valuable member of the club."" And now after a bad run of games (after an incredible run over 14 where we beat Spurs, City, and Southampton) the knives are out. It's incredible. Some of our fans are incredibly fickle. Yes we've had a poor season overall but there have been plenty of mitigating circumstances. 

The man deserves another season at least to prove he's got what it takes. There needs to be an overhaul of the transfer committee.

null,false,Soul_Rage,null,null,null,"**FPTP** is **First-Past-The-Post**. It's the system we currently use; you just add up a single vote from each person, and whoever has the most wins. There are some technicalities, but it generally doesn't get much more complicated than that.

**AV** is **Alternative Vote**. Basically, you rank candidates in order of preference. You can do this for as many, or as few as you'd like. Initially, only the first preferences are counted, and if anyone gets more than 50% of the total votes, they win immediately. If nobody is favoured by more than 50% of the voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second choices of those voters are brought into play. This process is repeated until a candidate has more than 50% of the votes.

Imagine a scenario where there are three parties - Cake, Fruit, Steak. Most people vote for the Cake or Steak, but the Cake vote is often split between Cake and Fruit, because they both appeal to the same sort of people. So the votes generally looked like:

&gt;Cake 36%

&gt;Fruit 21%

&gt;Steak 43%

So Steak wins, because the sweet-tooth vote is split. This is *bad* for democracy. The Fruit voters don't want Steak! They'd rather have the sugary goodness of Cake; some of them are opposed to meat entirely. With *Alternative Vote* though, the voters all get a second preference! Fruit votes would be redistributed, and we'd see:

&gt;Cake 56%

&gt;Steak 44%

Cake wins! Democracy in action. Now, this weird new party has popped up: Death. Most people don't like Death, but they appeal to a particular, weird sect of society that threatens to turn out in force. The voters are again split, and the initial votes look like this:

&gt;Cake 25%

&gt;Fruit 20%

&gt;Steak 25%

&gt;Death 30%

Oh no! Death is winning, even though only 30% of the voters want Death, presumably because they're old, sheltered, or just plain misanthropic. Steak and Death could form some sort of weird coalition? Maybe the Fruit voters should have voted tactically, and gone with Cake? In a first-past-the-post system (FPTP), things don't work out so well; what about with Alternative Vote (AV)? Well, the Fruit voters again don't get their first choice, but their voices aren't completely unheard:

&gt;Cake 40%

&gt;Steak 28%

&gt;Death 32%

Now, Cake still don't have the majority, so we're still not done yet. It wouldn't be fair to create a government out of Cake if only 40% of the people want it. So now we ask what the Steak people want. Turns out, while death is an import part of Steak, the Death party still sounds a bit batshit insane, and most of them would rather have Cake than Death.

&gt;Cake 65%

&gt;Death 35%

And thus, the people are better represented than under FPTP; radical parties with devout voters fail to overpower the majority, which would otherwise be divided and weakened. Now, AV isn't *perfect*; there are scenarios where tactical voting can still come into play, but it doesn't take much to realise it is far better than FPTP.

**AMS* is the **Additional Member System**, which is *semi-proportional* representation. Basically you get two votes: One for which party you want to win, and one for which local candidate you want to win in your constituency. So if your local guy has been doing a really rubbish job around your town, but he belongs to the party you think is really great, then your two votes can address that. This system is still prone to tactical voting, and doesn't often remedy any of the problems with First-Past-The-Post (FPTP). There are also major issues where it has been introduced of voters simply misunderstanding how the system works at all.

Finally, **STV* is **Single Transferrable Vote**. This one is... complicated, but honestly, it's probably the best choice. It provides proportional representation for the election of multiple candidates. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLH_w5kHJpA) video does an okay job of explaining it.

&gt;electoral fraud is **more likely to
be committed by or in support of candidates standing for election in areas
which are largely or predominately populated by some South Asian
communities**, specifically those with roots in parts of Pakistan or Bangladesh. 

&gt;We have begun further work to identify relevant evidence in order to help
address **concerns about the vulnerability of some South Asian communities,
specifically those with roots in parts of Pakistan or Bangladesh, to electoral
fraud.** 

&gt;Some people who have raised concerns about the risk of electoral fraud
within specific South Asian communities have also argued that the wider
availability of postal voting in Great Britain since 2001 has increased the risk
of electoral fraud associated with this approach, as the greater safeguards of
secrecy provided by polling stations are removed. We have also heard
concerns and allegations about the intimidation of electors outside polling stations in specific areas.

That is just your theory, it's not fact. I presume you are referring to Mutually Assured Destruction but I think you assume too much when you say that all of the nukes would be launched.

Lets say an agressor launches a nuke at the U.S. It's quite obvious they would launch everything they've got back, hence, M.A.D.

However if a nuke was launched at a country without a nuclear threat, then the question for everyone else around the world who has nukes is, ""Is it worth us counter-attacking on behalf of our ally?"" - the answer I assume would lean towards NO, not unless the aggressor was targetting them also.

Self preservation would be the primary driving force. Our allies would not respond on our behalf unless they were also a target.

In the Commons debate on the Inquiry Report it was asserted by the Government (on the advice of the NCB and supported by comments in the Tribunal report) that the remaining tips above Aberfan were not dangerous and did not warrant removal (estimated by the Tribunal to cost £3m), but merely required landscaping (a much cheaper option).[16] This was promptly contradicted by the local MP;[16] as Margaret Thatcher pointed out the report noted that ""One may conclude that No. 5"" (tip) ""has been standing and is standing at a very low factor of safety."" Despite the initial Government opposition, public pressure led to a decision to remove the remaining tips: the Secretary of State for Wales stressed however, that they were safe "" but I know from my contacts with the people of Aberfan that they constitute a pyschological, emotional danger "".[23] If the tips were not physically dangerous, Robens saw no obligation on the NCB to pay the full cost of their removal. The government made a grant of £200,000 to the NCB towards the cost of removing the tips,[24] and under ""intolerable pressure"" from the government, the Trustees of the Disaster Fund agreed to contribute £150,000. At the time, the Charity Commission made no objection to this action, but it has subsequently been criticised as ""unquestionably unlawful"" under charity law.[25]

It's a shrewd move on his part - the optics alone are good (and certainly better in comparison to Cameron's ducking and weaving about debates) and he'll likely reach an audience that the Tories and Lib Dems can't. Remember - a lot of people get a lot of their information from Brand and nowhere else (somebody I know on Facebook literally told me precisely that the other day), again for better or for worse, and only Miliband is presenting himself to those people. His viewership is potentially almost six times the daily circulation of The Sun. That is huge.

In addition, a website (titled ""Lying in Ponds"") that tracks partisanship among public intellectuals rated Krugman second in the overall partisan slant of his columns, behind only Ann Coulter.[31] As Richard Posner and economist Mark J. Perry note, the site, which uses careful statistical analysis to make assessments political partisanship, has ranked Paul Krugman the number 1 or number 2 most biased every single year from 2002-2008.[32][33]

&gt; The Economist magazine supported the finding, noting the vast majority of Krugman's columns feature attacks on Republicans and almost none criticize Democrats, making him ""a sort of ivory-tower folk-hero of the American left—a thinking person's Michael Moore"" and that ""a glance through his past columns reveals a growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush.""[31] And speaking on Krugman's recent ""prophecy of doom"" regarding the 2010 election, the magazine calls it a ""baseless partisan freakout"".

&gt;It is impossible for countries such as the US and the UK, which borrow in their own currencies, to experience Greek-style crises, because they cannot run out of money – they can always print more

That is only because we can pay our debt in our currency.  It's a bit like saying *We don't need to ever have chemotherapy, because we don't have cancer just the second*.  Sure, we can do that today, but if the economy really tanked, we would have to pay in a stable currency.  If we just printed more money, the inflation, the drop in value of our own currency would result in us having to borrow in foreign, a positive feedback cycle (a bad thing), you can see this happen when countries like Argentina tried to peg their currency value to appease the debt holders.

This is very important distinction, because comparing us to say Japan, we rely a lot on international [1], rather than domestic bond/gilt holders.

I find as a result I am not convinced by a lot of his argument, because his first premise is flawed, having your own currency, whilst useful, isn't a magic bullet, it's not a panacea of fiscal policy.

I don't have time to put together a manifesto for you.

That's my biggest complaint about the current discussion, about the narrative pushed by the campaigns. It's all about coming up with policies because the philosophy they use to come up with the policy is right, not because the policy will bring the best benefit.

&gt;if we want to attract business and investment the tax rates have to be inviting

I'm not in favour of increasing corporation tax.

If I lost my job, I could probably only last a couple of months. I don't know how I'd survive running for political office. Donations? That's not even legal is it?

In order to get power to leave the EU, they have to have an opinion on all matters, and their policy statement has been deliberately designed to attract votes. They have advertised a  few solid, sensible policies. Many of which are being offered by other parties.

The most obvious example, to me, is their reasonable suggestion that we introduce an Australian style points based immigration system. That sounds like a fair compromise at first glance. We keep skilled workers *and* reduce immigration. It's such a good idea in fact, that it was introduced in 2008 by Gordon Brown's government. 

Ukip's entire argument rests not on what we should do, but on what we should *not* do. 

""Does it seem fair that people can come to our country just to claim benefits?"", 
Well of course, when you put it that way, no. It doesn't. But they can't now, so what's your point?

It is  impossible to predict how a party is going to use its power from their manifesto, or pre-election promises. You have to look at their ideology. The lib dems promised to block tuition fee rises, but as soon as they were offered something that promoted their ideological goals (electoral reform), they abandoned that policy in favour of what was more important to them (and will do it again). The Tories promised Big Society, but immediately abandoned that in favour of their ideological goal of reducing  state control of business and privatisation. 

The media have a strong part to play in all of this. When Labour reel out endless lists of policies and blindingly complicated economic arguments explaining how they want to borrow more, but that's actually *not* going to bankrupt Britain because blah blah blah Keynesian Economics blah blah interest rates. It all boils down to ""Ed Miliband looks weird and nicked his brother's job. And remember that time you were late for work because the train drivers went on strike?"".

I'm not implying that the Beeb is biased etc, but if Clarkson were the persona he presents, you'd imagine him to be the kind to highlight media bias.

Myself personally, I really want to like Brand. 

A lot of the subjects he brings up are things that interest me, and I really respect the fact that he puts them on the agenda. I do find him a bit of a contradiction in some ways, but that feels like a marketing strategy of appealing to as many of the people as often as possible.

In terms of BTL, it's possible.  I did it at your age.

What really matters is what percentage of your house you own.

Let's say the house is worth £200k, if you own £90k (45%) you'll need a Loan To Value (LTV) of 55%.  Generally speaking, the lower LTV the better the rates.  Eg http://www.coventrybuildingsociety.co.uk/mortgages/buy-to-let.aspx

Most BTLs will insist that the incoming rent is 125% of the payments.  So, in this fictional example...

* Borrow £110k @ 3%
* Repayments = £522 per month
* Rent will need to be at least 1.25 * £522 = £652.50 per month.

The root problem in my opinion is that we never adopted a real democracy. A true democracy should operate under a paradigm of power coming from the bottom up. Before we had our current parliamentary system we had a feudal system with a hereditary monarch which was by its very nature a top down power structure. We have gradually transitioned from this into our parliamentary system but retained the basic top down power paradigm that was part of the old system.

So your proposition does not help everyone.

I understand the fear, that traditional Christians will be put under pressure to conform to the views of wider society or they will be marginalised if they speak out. But they have a history of disfellowshipping and marginalising and criminalising LGBT people that is even worse. They can't complain if they are ostracised or denounced in return. They will have to accept that civil society and other denominations have a different definition of marriage.

You and I can hold whatever beliefs we like, if we harass or coerce others we are stepping over a line. This applies on both sides. It's not surprising that equal marriage hasn't happened in a region defined by sectarian divisions. Sectarianism is inimical to a liberal (in the classic sense) society.

I don't think you can say that you want to encourage the model of one man one woman marriage without acknowledging that you are thereby stigmatising same-sex couples.

&gt; But working in borrowing extra for the new deposit makes repayments about 1200.

Are you basing this on a repayment mortgage or an interest only? **Do not get a repayment mortgage** on the property you're going to let out, do it on interest only. Interest only gives you a big buffer zone sufficient to cover costs, interest rate rises and empty periods plus put cash in your pocket which you can use to make a capital payment off either the property you're renting out or the one you're living in. The amount you owe won't ever go up but your equity will continue to do so. 

Doing it on repayment you don't have anything like the same buffer between rental income and mortgage repayments. you can get very quickly to the point where you're having to find money from elsewhere to pay your tax bill as only the interest portion of mortgage payments is tax deductible. 

With the £1200 a month being for a repayment mortgage and your rental income being £1400 a month, depending on how far you're into the mortgage and how much of the repayment is interest you would need to find money from elsewhere to pay the tax bill plus all other expenses (insurances, gas safety checks, letting agent fees etc) would also have to be met from elsewhere as there isn't even sufficient rental income to cover the mortgage payments and tax bill.",null,0,null,1430308020,null,0,1430308809,0,cqsiqcd,null,t3_348ne8,null,t1_cqsiqcd,null,t3_348ne8,null,null,null,1432669923,null,0,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,0,null

our options are a) leave him out entirely or b) cater to him by modifying your system. When your system is clearly not working because of personnel (or lack thereof) - I'd suggest that it's probably a good idea to change it up and give something different a try. There's numerous examples to show Balotelli gives you no movement as a lone striker - so why insist on playing him as such?

If you've guessed right, and the ruffians display a positive gesture (In the local vernacular, ""Yeooooo""). You are fine.

If you guessed wrong, and the crowd displays displeasure, don't panic. Simply pull out the lighter, and burn the flag, to win over the crowd.

Believers have already had to conform to the law on this issue, which is a stronger constraint that coercion or harassment. So how do we decide who gets to impose on other's beliefs?

Even Stephen Lawrence's mother thinks that that report ignored police corruption. Trevor Phillips has agreed that a blind eye was turned because of a fear of being seen as racist. It is a fact that these particular gangs were predominantly from one particular region of Pakistan.

All that needs to happen is for people to do/be allowed to do their jobs and enforce the existing law without fear or favour. If these gangs had been dealt with as it was reported it wouldn't be a big story. Some of them probably wouldn't have started at all because they wouldn't have heard how easy it was.

So once the pressure is taken off the police there needs to be prosecution wherever of those who forced inaction. Undoubtedly they were acting on policy, but there comes a point where that ceases to be a defence for those confronted with the reality on the ground.

On a broader basis there needs to be *much* better protection of whistle-blowers across the whole public sector.

Keep in mind that the US was at a gold standard and this was a world-wide depression, with quite different economic landscapes, but nevertheless... Wikipedia however has a very long entry on this and none that support this view.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_of_1920%E2%80%9321
 
**Interpretations of the end**

According to Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz the recession of 1920–21 was the result of an unnecessary contractionary monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.[14] Paul Krugman agrees that high interest rates due to inflation fighting of the Fed caused the problem. This did not cause a deficiency in aggregate demand but in Aggregate supply. Once the Fed relaxed its monetary policy the economy did rapidly recover.[15]

Additionally Allan H. Meltzer suggest that since the U.S. was on the Gold standard the flight of gold from hyper-inflationary Europe to the U.S. raised the nominal stock of high-powered base money. This ended the deflation and contributed to the economic recovery.[16]

James Grant discusses in the book The Forgotten Depression why the depression of 1920-1921 was relatively short compared to the economic recession and the following economic downturn that started in 2007. ""The essential point about the long ago downturn of 1920-1921 is that it was kind of a last demonstration of how a price mechanism works and the last governmentally unmedicated business cycle downturn, meaning it was the last one that the government didn't attempt to treat with fiscal intervention war with much lower interest rates. In fact the FED, then still wet behind the ears it only had been founded in 1914, actually raised rates in the face of a truly brutal deflation.""

Thomas Woods a proponent of the heterodox Austrian School argues that President Harding's laissez-faire economic policies during the 1920–21 recession, combined with a coordinated aggressive policy of rapid government downsizing, had a direct influence on the rapid and widespread private-sector recovery.[17] Woods argued that, as there existed massive distortions in private markets due to government economic influence related to World War I, an equally massive correction to the distortions needed to occur as quickly as possible to realign investment and consumption with the new peace-time economic environment. Daniel Kuehn's recent research calls into question many of the assertions Woods makes about the 1920–21 recession:[18]
the most substantial downsizing of government was attributable to the Wilson administration, and occurred well before the onset of the 1920–21 recession.
the Harding administration raised revenues in 1921 by expanding the tax base considerably at the same time that it lowered rates.
Kuehn also argues that Woods underemphasizes the role the monetary stimulus played in reviving the depressed economy and that, since the 1920–21 recession was not characterized by a deficiency in aggregate demand, fiscal stimulus was unwarranted.

I respect Chelsea and Mourinho as a winning machine. They're not always fun to watch but that's not what they're there for - they're built for winning titles, not my affection.

Got bored of watching United winning the league every damn year a long time ago but now they're not winning I have found them pretty entertaining to watch. They're not the predictable results machine they were under Fergie and that means I have a reason to switch on their games.

The point is that Britain's possession of nuclear weapons contributed nothing to the defence of the Falklands.

&gt; They are really quite cheap £30bn

Dubious figure. Not only have similar military purchases, such as Trident, historically gone way over budget, but your figure only covers the initial purchase cost. The higher figure of £100m, given by Sturgeon, includes the costs to keep them maintained during their lifetime (approx £57m) and then their eventual decommissioning costs (approx £13m). Only looking at the up-front cost of something is bad accounting.

&gt; Do you think Ukraine was right to decommission it's deterrent?
 
That's more complex, since Ukraine had far more to fear from Russia than we have ever had, and the hollowness of the defence guarantees that were given to it as part of the Budapest Memorandum. 

However, it's really hard to measure such ""what if"" scenarios. If it had kept nuclear weapons, it's easy to imagine plenty of outcomes far worse than it's currently in, especially given the corruption of it's former leadership. I'd suggest that when Yanukovych was in power, he would almost certainly have taken steps to ensure that nuclear weapons were controlled by factions in the military that were sympathetic to him, and as such, when the Ukraine broke apart, I'd suspect the nukes would equally likely have ended up with the rebels (or the Russians) as with Kiev.",null,0,null,1430310179,null,0,false,0,cqsjjjn,null,t3_348rd5,null,t1_cqsjjjn,null,t1_cqsj2be,null,null,null,1432670305,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Rodgers spoke to Balotelli face-to-face, and maybe with Sturridge in mind (turned him down in the summer previous to signing because of doubts over his character), he decided to gamble and go for the signing with a potentially larger upside.

Also, the fact that the second choice striker signing was left so late. It should've been one of the earliest signings we made, and also the signing we contributed a serious amount of resources on. Its impossible to overestimate how important goals are.

I don't think Bony would've been an amazing signing, but he would've been a million times better than Balotelli and Rodgers wanted him. It just makes no sense.

Its also ridiculous how fans criticise Rodgers for signings when he barely has any control. Having final say on choices you do not want, when your choices are not respected, is not any real control.

Also, if we made a good striker signing last summer, it puts the rest of the signings in a better light, there is less pressure on everyone else.

&gt; if I have a CC balance but paying the minimum or more each month, is it a negative on my score?

There's 2 considerations here.  

Firstly potential lenders will consider how much debt you currently have when deciding how much they are comfortable lending you.  The reason for that should be obvious - the more you are paying other lenders already, the less you can afford to pay them.

Secondly carrying a credit card balance is generally expensive (ignoring promotional 0% deals and the like).  If you're only paying the minimum payments on expensive credit card debt this can be a sign that either you're shit at managing money or your finances are very stretched, because if neither of those things was true you should be paying down your expensive debt faster.

A better comparison would be 1980s Italy. Italy had gigantic devaluation-fuelled inflation in the 1980s, but because it was a major world economy and located in Europe, it never even came close to having to borrow in a foreign currency.

Every time you make a payment on a full repayment mortgage a chunk of the monthly fee is interest (on  the large amount of money you owe) and another chunk is paying off the actual debt (reducing it a little each month). Usually your mortgage repayments are set for the duration of the mortgage so at the beginning of the term most of the monthly payment is actually interest, but as the debt is reduced each month, a bigger and bigger proportion is repayment of the principle. If you take out an interest only mortgage the repayments are much less, at the end of the term you will still owe all the money, but the entire monthly costs is tax deductible.

Krugman, the author of this piece and a noted economist, has been shooting full broadsides against austerity since day 0. [Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/opinion/01krugman.html) is a 2008 article against austerity in the US. [This](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/britains-deficit/) is an article of his from early 2010 arguing against the austerity plans of the UK Conservatives.

A better question would be ""why was the whole world seemingly convinced that austerity was the way forward, when it had never been successfull in the past? why did no one listen to the mainstream economists arguing against it, and instead relied on the few cranks who expounded its merits based on unsound arguments?""",null,0,null,1430312919,null,0,false,0,cqskqsf,null,t3_3492re,null,t1_cqskqsf,null,t1_cqsg4xa,null,null,null,1432670872,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

It is not meant to be a perfect solution but it can give short time relief in exceptional circumstances. If investors are told that the measure would be temporary that should mitigate negative effects just as forward guidance has helped reduce volatility.  

I would also be wary of immediately jumping from printing money to high inflation. That would be true in the general case but Krugman is recommending to print money during a recession, a period of low private consumption and investment which would naturally have low inflation. The borrowed money would then increase consumption and investment to more normal levels and inflation should only rise to standard levels as well. Look at QE, the Bank of England prints new money to buy government debt, this is basically the same as printing new money to service the debt and yet inflation is low and British gilts are still sought after assets. 

Regarding your point about governmental debt. The plots in your source are misleading, though oversea holders are indeed the second largest group they only make ~30% of total (as the other holders are domestic), so they are actually a minority. Around 10% of Japan's debt is held by oversea holders (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-19/foreign-ownership-of-japanese-debt-rises-to-highest-since-1979). Considering that Japan's debt to GDP ratio is roughly 3 times that of the UK's and our GDPs are comparable then in absolute terms the amount of debt held by foreigners is comparable in both countries.

Dawson - Was our worst CB under AVB and did nothing early on with Poch, in fact I remember the majority of this board being sad but relieved that he went to Hull, again hasn't pulled up any trees with Hull, needed to go!

So yes, Russia, China, whoever, could do a vast amount of damage and take us into World War 3 well before anyone would consider using nuclear weapons.

However, there would come a point when that room would run out and the choice faced is: continue on the same path and face certain destruction.

If 50% of people voted Labour, in terms of mandate, it would be perceived that they had the full support of 50% of the nation (assuming a 100% turnout), whereas in reality, half of those people might only be voting for them begrudgingly. 

Perhaps there should be an ""begrudging"" option, so as you could tick a box to say that you are only voting for who you are voting for because you have to vote for someone, but that your vote should not be taken as a positive endorsement of the candidate.

It scales all the current polls and predicts the result, so support is concentrated in the same pattern as it is now but multiplied.

If a whole [12% of all voters switched from Labour to voting Green](http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/?CON=33.7&amp;LAB=21.2&amp;LIB=8.4&amp;UKIP=13.7&amp;GRN=16.9), 12% of the 650 seats ought to be a gain of 78. But the Greens would rise from 1 seat to only 2 while Labour drop from 267(current prediction, not current seats) to 198(-69) and the Conservatives benefit from the vote being split and rise from 275 to 331(+56), winning the election outright and can do anything they want, the exact opposite of what voters wanted. The Greens are in a terrible position as their votes are diluted amongst a huge number of constituencies with the exception of Brighton.

Likewise, say that [10% of all voters switch from Conservative to UKIP.](http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/?CON=23.7&amp;LAB=33.2&amp;LIB=8.4&amp;UKIP=23.7&amp;GRN=4.9&amp;CON=23.7) UKIP rise from 2 to 18 seats but the Conservatives drop from 275 to 200 and Labour rise from 267 to 318. A Labour coalition is now much, much easier and a Conservative coalition impossible which is the opposite of what voters voted for. UKIP is a bit more lucky in that their support is more concentrated in certain constituencies. In reality they seem to be taking votes (or getting votes from new voters! the voter turnout is another variable) from all 3 main parties, which is a bit scary.

However the number of seats each party gets with a specific % vote share can vary wildly depending on where the votes are. It's hardly democratic.

Edit: You can also see that the SNP are predicted to do very well under FPTP with 51% of the vote in Scotland netting them almost 100% of the seats there.

Agreement: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78977/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf

* Recall of MPs
 - Legislation promised (10% voter petition required).
 - Enacted: http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/recallofmps.html

* Cut MPs by 10%
 - Agreement says ""cut perks and bureaucracy"".
 - Nothing achieved AFAIK, as responsibility is held by IPSA - established in 2009 by the previous govt.

* Cut minister's pay
 - Couldn't find this in the agreement
 - Was apparently done: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/ministers-pay-cut-frozen

* Cut government spending
 - Don't think anyone can really argue that this wasn't done.
 - UK did not in fact suffer a double-dip recession, as claimed: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/27/uk-avoid-double-dip-recession-ons-data

* Act on national debt; aim for lower mortgage rates.
 - Neither pledge nor agreement is specific about levels; this came later in budgets
 - Mortgage rates are indeed low, partly due to funding for lending: http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-2378782/The-true-impact-Funding-Lending-year-on.html

* Reduce emissions
 - In agreement, specifically by requiring new coal power to be carbon-capture, and reducing central gov emissions.
 - Seems like they went through with this: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27063796 . I don't think they succeeded on reducing gov emissions, though.

* Increase spending on health
 - Agreement specifically promises real terms increases.
 - Arguably met or not met, marginally, depending on how you use the numbers: https://fullfact.org/articles/NHS_budget_health_spending_statistics-28697

* Tax breaks for married couples; more Sure Start health visitors
 - In agreement with more detail (specifically mentions Sure Start scale-back)
 - Tax break delivered. Lots of Sure Start centres closed - couldn't find good up-to-date impact on HV changes, except this: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213110/Health-visitor-implementation-plan.pdf

* Local control of planning system
 - Agreement promised abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies, Infrastructure Planning Commission
 - Both abolished

* Itemise government spending
 - In agreement.
 - Data appears to be published. e.g. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/25000-spend

* Create 400,000 apprenticeships; cut benefits for work refusal
 - Rather less specific in the agreement.
 - Appears to have been exceeded by a decent margin: https://fullfact.org/education/apprentice_double_coalition_compare_labour-30026

* Reduce immigration to 1990s levels ""10,000s""
 - Agreement says ""We will introduce an annual limit on the number of non-EU economic migrants admitted into the UK to live and work.""
 - Evidence is that it's now extremely hard to get a work visa (arguably a bad thing). Goal of 10,000s certainly not met.

* Give parents/charities/other groups powers to start schools
 - In agreement as academies
 - Done.

* Link pension to earnings; protect old people benefits
 - In agreement
 - Winter fuel cut, but otherwise most would agree that pensioners have done rather well

* Cut police paperwork; ensure sentences are served
 - In agreement
 - Unsure if implemented concretely. Cuts have definitely been quite sharp, but crime figures are stable: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b935fffe-ef98-11e2-8229-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Vybe8KRn

* Create national citizen service
 - In agreement
 - Done. Seems like a sort of summer camp: https://www.gov.uk/government/get-involved/take-part/national-citizen-service

TL;DR version: Seems like they met most of these promises.

Liverpool, I feel like they just really want you to like them and respect them, and don't understand the reasoning if you don't. For all the talk about Arsenal's online persona and their obsession with ""class"", I would personally say Liverpool is a bit more guilty of this. 

As a team I probably also respect Arsenal the most as I find Wenger's naive dedication to beautiful football admirable and entertaining. It's also hard to overlook what he's accomplished there with his resources of late as compared to the other top teams. I *guess* I like Chelsea as well, but I'd say I more admire a lot of their players (love Matic, Terry, and Hazard) and the discipline Mourinho has instilled in them. They scare me in a way Arsenal, Pool, City, United, or (lol) Spurs don't: with the squad they have I could see them winning a couple titles in a row if Jose doesn't go off the deep end again.

 take home pay each month makes it difficult to meet rent or mortgage payments and other household bills, to access credit and to plan financially for the future.

Impact on families:  While employers argue that flexible working arrangements assist individuals with caring responsibilities, the lack of a work guarantee, and related unpredictability of work from week to week (and day to day) can put a strain on families and their ability to arrange childcare or elder care.

Lack of employment rights:  Many zero-hours contract workers lose out on basic workplace protections, because they fail to qualify as employees, lack the necessary continuity of service or because their employer takes advantage of their uncertain employment status to evade employment rights obligations.

Abuse at work:  Zero-hours contracts are more vulnerable to mistreatment and exploitation at work than regular permanent contracts. For example, there is a growing evidence of breaches of National Minimum Wage legislation in the home care sector, with a significant proportion of care workers not receiving pay for travel time.

Difficulties accessing benefits:  The variability of individual’s earnings can create difficulties over eligibility for various forms of benefit. For example, the working tax credit for a single person can only be claimed if an individual works 16 hours a week, but whether an individual exceeds these hours can vary from week to week under zero-hours, often leading to delayed payments and increased uncertainty and pressure on household incomes. The TUC is concerned that with the introduction of the universal credit, zero hours contract workers on low incomes may be placed under increased pressure to look for additional work, even though they have no control over the number of working hours they are allocated by employers. Some will be placed in the invidious 
position of penalised by their employer because they have accepted another job or facing benefits sanctions for failing to do the same thing.

The fact of the matter is we have a squad of players and a significant portion of them may not have been chosen by the manager, which is a big problem.

FSG have a plan in place for the future of the club, and that involves signing players who are young enough to have a significant resale value. Our manager should be allowed to sign whichever players he wants within those guidelines set forward by FSG, but instead he is hamstrung by a committee.

United knew exactly what they were getting when they signed Van Persie. He was bought to stop City getting him and to win the title back, which is exactly what they got. Everybody involved knew he wasn't going to be able to keep it up for more than a couple of seasons at the most.

The club's scouting network is out there scouring the world for potential targets. Plenty of players will be suggested as transfer targets. The manager will certainly have enough time to check out the suggested players, and it should be his choice and his alone whether they would be a good fit for his team.

Hudd could pass, and that's about it.  We couldn't afford to give someone who had to be made up for significant minutes, because we're not Juve, and he's not Pirlo.

Defoe had a good streak of form, but he's wasteful as all fuck when he's not on fantastic form, and again, we couldn't afford to give minutes to him.  He was too selfish for his lack of scoring.

Benny had 100% checked out.  He put in a couple decent performances on loan, but couldn't even get it going in the Championship, with a manager who's known for his ability to motivate more than set up tactics.

Daws and Caulker I won't argue.  Between Fazio and Vlad, I'd probably take the other pair, though that's more a testament to Caulker than Daws.  I love the man, but Fazio is the better player in my mind.  

As for the other players, I'll take Soldado over JD because he's the polar opposite.  Far more focused on provided than a forward really should be.  But in the end, I think that's more beneficial than a forward who shoots at the first sight of a net.

Capoue has shown immense ability, and Benji has been very well rounded and useful when given minutes.  Neither have the passing range Hudd does, but I'd take either over him in an instant.  And I think Capoue on his best form is up with Sandro on his best.

Lamela is insanely talented, and incredibly young besides.

So did it fail to go back on track, or did it return to pre-crisis level? because these two sentences are mutually exclusive. It went back to pre-crisis levels, i.e. back on track.

&gt; Your graph also usefully lacks a scale- is that real or nominal spend?

[It's inflation adjusted](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-spending), of course, i.e. real spending.

&gt; Also, we're talking about post 2010

No, we are talking about the merits of austerity as an anti-recession strategy. If you want to consider the US case, you need to consider the period of the US recession, not an arbitrary point in time.

&gt; The cuts have happened and are ongoing, which is how government spend has fallen as your own graph indicates.

You are confusing the end of stimulus and the fall in unemployment payments with structural spending cuts. The US government spending hundreds of billions in stimulus during the recession and then no longer spending hundreds of billions in stimulus after the recession isn't austerity.

&gt; The sequester cuts $1.1trn from the next 10 years' budgets; how is that a ""temporary spending halt""?

In short a reduction of government spending doesn't cause enough investment to cover the reductions. It's also why they tried to put up ""the big society "" because it was trying to use private entities to pay for things such as heath care and help for the disabled.

Unfortunately this gamble by the current government was flawed and they should of kept spending or kept it stable. But alas as always ideology got in the way. 

Also it's annoying that they seam to like neo-liberal or neo-classical  which is back the wealth of  nations and trying to sort the economy by forcing labour cost to the zero lower bound. But that is another discussion.

&gt;    The chart shows Osborne’s original plan for the progress of the government’s current balance until 2015, along with what actually happened and is now forecast to happen in the next year. The slowdown in the pace of deficit reduction in 2012 is plain to see.

&gt;    This slowdown was not caused by the government going back on its plans to reduce its spending. Instead it largely reflected disappointing tax receipts, caused in part by an unexpected decline in real wages. Osborne could have stuck to his original deficit reduction plan by raising taxes or cutting spending further. But he chose not to. An honest chancellor would have said that the funding crisis panic of 2010 had passed so the pace of austerity could be slowed. But to do that would have been to admit that austerity was bad for growth, and therefore that Plan A had delayed the recovery. Instead Osborne chose to bluff it out, and insist that his original plan was on track. To do this he needed a compliant media.

Spurs I have less of a problem with but dislike the fact that they seem to play bad football and yet still get the wins (although I guess this could be said against all clubs), maybe because I live with an Arsenal fan and his hatred has worn off on me but I still dislike the spurs. 

As for United and Chelsea I have nothing personal against them I just see them as top teams will endless amounts of money, for Chelsea I have yet to see any exciting football (I may be watching the wrong games) and they just seem a team that technically plays well and gets the results, united have had ups and downs recently, I dislike Van Gaal but I like some of there players. On both teams my response would be ""meh"". 

Man City are slightly different, I loved the fact that there was a new team in the top flight that won a season and then two but over time they have blended in with the others as just endless pots of money, I think they play some really exciting football but are now blending in with the other big teams. 

Finally Arsenal, I may be biased as said above living with someone who is a fan but I really like the team, the thing I like the most about them is that they are not boring, one game they could lose 6-0 and then the next win 5-1, they are always fun to watch and the fact that they have some fun players on their team such as the Ox makes them more entertaining.

Those are my thoughts, I am sure people will be telling me why I am right or wrong about certain views, but the main thing is that I am happy that my team (the mighty saints) are for now included in the top EPL teams which is fantastic.",null,0,null,1430316090,null,0,false,0,cqsmdit,null,t3_348wp4,null,t1_cqsmdit,null,t3_348wp4,null,null,null,1432671640,null,1,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,1,null

I get your point but you're trying to use one thing to prove another and that doesn't work. 

What is said about homosexuality and marriage in the Bible is said. Interpret away - it's a silly faith. But I find Christian apology worse than fundamentalist Christianity. Because at least they don't jump through philosophical hoops to try to make the religion seem palatable to everyone else. 

We're supposed to have separation of church and state? Who said so? I think we should - I think churches should be taxed too and all or no religions taught in schools. But where is this automatic privilege for separation? Our representatives have voted against it - the PM says its a Christian country - there's still a Christian monarch - I still have to designate whether I'm from a Protestant or Catholic background on equality forms even though I'm a heathen. I even got kicked out of the Scouts for saying I didn't believe in a God. It's a lovely idea but we don't have it and we don't have an inalienable right to it. 

Separation of church and state doesn't even help in this argument because if they are separate then churches should have the right to descriminate because of their Holy teachings and gays should just get married a city hall or have civil partnerships. 

Which I'd mostly agree with even though I'm really anti-religious. I find this apologetic pro-gay Christian stance I see these days as like a Stockholm Syndrome.

**Name of product:** Uriage Bariésun Lait Enfants SPF 50+

**Price of product:** €15 for 100ml

**Where did you purchase:** Melita Pharmacy (St. Julians, Malta)

**Product claims:** *Thanks to a high performance filtering complex, this milk provides very high sun protection. Easy to apply, this highly fluid milk penetrates quickly and ensures high tolerance.*

*Ensures very high protection*

*A genuine technological breakthrough, the photoprotective complex is formulated with a combination of only 3 anti UVA and UVB filters that work in perfect synergy and are reinforced by photostabilizing emollients.*

*Intensely moisturizes*

*Enriched with Aquaspongines and Uriage Thermal Water, this milk provides intense protection against dehydration.*

* *Uriage Thermal Water*
* *Anti UVB-UVA filtering complex with Tinosorb M*
* *Aquaspongines*
* *Stabilized Vitamin C and Vitamin E*

* *Hypoallergenic*
* *Non-comedogenic*
* *Fragrance-free*
* *Alcohol-free*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** It has regular lotion texture, feels lightweight, applies white but mostly dissipates (tolerable whitecast even on me), BUT it's a bit streaky and it pills like no tomorrow, even just lightly dragging my finger on the skin. It also stings upon application. It does look a bit better after a while, and looks great under powder, but it's hard to wait so long for all the pills to fall off.
After so many fails with chemical/organic UV filters, I'm starting to think my face is sensitive to it.

On the body, it feels velvety, barely any tackiness and greasiness. There's some whitecast, but it's nowhere as bad as LRP Lait Veloute. Unfortunately, it is not too water resistant. It's quite easily washed off in the water. Reapplication has to be diligent.

This would be perfect to be worn for outdoor activities that doesn't include water activities as it feels comfortable on the skin. 

Although it doesn't say on the body label, Uriage claims the PPD to be 20 when contacted by e-mail by a redditor.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** It's not as liquidy for a spray as one would expect, more like a lotion but it feels really lightweight. It applies white and stays pretty white (pretty strong whitecast on me). Makes face looks paler and pinkish, completely off with neck and chest. I imagine it would look better on lighter skintone, would look nice as powdered makes it more look like skin (it doesn't have -cones). Shine and tack/grease doesn't go away in 15 minutes, but blotting doesn't seem to take off much sunscreen. My face hurts when taking off, although it doesn't sting upon application. After so many fails with chemical/organic UV filters, I'm starting to think my face is sensitive to it.

On the body, it has quite some whitecast that doesn't completely dissipates on me.
It feels a bit tacky and greasy on the skin, too. But, it has real good water resistance. Water would just trickles and beads over the layer of sunscreen. It doesn't get washed off. It's that strong that even the whitecast stays. This should be perfect for water activities/sports. It's really tenacious.

Uriage doesn't put the PPD/UVA score on the body label, but they claim that this has PPD 20 when contacted via e-mail by a redditor.

I personally wouldn't repurchase this. I think I'll stick to Boots Soltan Baby Lotion as my favourite overall and the Uriage Bariésun Lait Enfants for when I'm outdoor but no to little water activities.

Off my head here's two strategies:
Do you have a 'digital skill' you could sell? If you can write well, transcribe, design logo's, edit photo's, fix code etc. there are loads of places on the web where people will pay you to do that for them. One of the easiest is content creation (writing). If you can write well, on any topic it's not hard to find someone willing to pay you to do so.

Alternatively, I would look at building a website (it's so easy to do these days) that solves a problem. As an example, in my town one thing that really annoys me is none of the barbers have websites or publish their opening times online. It does my head in. I've often thought about registering www.smalltownsbarbers.co.uk and building a simple site with information on every barbers in the town on it, as well as the opening times. Then I would try and find a barber willing to pay me to put themselves at the top, or bigger, or buy the whole website off me. 

Then rinse repeat and do the same for local butchers or something.

Are you interested in gardening (for example)? Maybe make a website with all the different gardening tools you've used reviewed an an amazon affiliate link on it. Lot's of people do this, but often they are very low quality, get your own angle and you will stand out.

I didn't say that.

More funding would have done nothing whatsoever because they were not even using the resources that they *did* have. 


The solutions are two-fold:

1) allow people to do their job and enforce the current law without fear or favour, and without being accused of being ""institutionally racist"" by vexatious minority groups on the basis of a report that was a cover-up for police corruption, even according to Mrs Lawrence herself.

2) improve the currently useless protections for whistleblowers working in public services.

&gt; All our “independent” Trident missiles in reality come from Lockheed Martin in the US and are maintained by the US Navy at Kings Bay, Georgia, USA, along with the Trident missiles for US submarines.

&gt; So we are being asked to spend around  £100bn – or 12 times the Tories’ NHS EXTRA funding centrepiece – to maintain and replace our “independent” nuclear strike capability – which does not exist.

It's not a problem for the English *establishment* (though the feeling is that Cameron only made an effort to save the union because he didn't want an ear-bashing from the Queen). 

The problem is the English *voter*. They do *not* like the SNP. And also, the referendum shone a spotlight onto Scotland for the first time in ages, and the English were unimpressed by the hatred, bile and sheer madness up there.

There'll be a switch to Conservative in England ""to keep the SNP out"".

null,false,andreww631,null,null,null,"At first your advocating that they play a higher line - all throughout Poch's tenure we've been playing a line in this situation roughly where our back line is in this gif. Could a higher line have prevented a chance in this particular instance? Perhaps. On the most part however playing a line in This situation as you've advocated would lead to more chances given via balls in behind. Southampton have reasonably clean possession here and iirc they had the ball for longer than the '5 seconds rule' our players often mention. They were therefore right to drop off in my opinion. Even if they were wrong to drop off it is a very minor mistake and the ensuing chance should have been prevented by Mason not making such basic and quite major errors. 

You advocating that Fazio just leaves Pelle at this point in time (giving Pelle a free run at the back post) is frankly absurd. Since when are centre backs meant to mark strikers and mark late runs into the box made by the opposition central midfielders. Fazio and Vertonghen are watching the cross and watching Pelles movement. How on earth are they meant in a few milliseconds to recognise that Mason hasn't done his basic job and react accordingly? 

With regards Fazio being at fault as much as Mason, how on earth is Fazio winning the ball (albeit not 100% cleanly) so that it falls ten metres away from any Sputhamoton player into the zone where Mason is meant to be filling in anyway equivalent to Mason failing to track a run - which again is the very basic tenant of central midfield play. It's just a complete false equivalency. By your logic any time a central defender fails to perfectly win a ball is an equal mistake to when a central midfielder fails to track a run. This is patently not true. If our central midfield is such that our centre backs can only afford to win 100% of their duels perfectly, then our central midfield is clearly the problem - not the CB's

Excuse me if I don't. Feel free to believe whatever you like. I'm perfectly happy to agree to disagree, as I have no vested interest in your beliefs, and am merely informing you as to why the hypothetical you are proposing is nonsensical and irrelevant. 

&gt; In my RE class we were taught about way more than just the major religions.

We strayed from the major five a little bit sometimes, including learning about smaller religions occasionally, but as it was a Religious Education class it did always stick to discussing *religions*. Organisations like Scientology were not included in my RE classes, and I have a sneaking suspicion it wasn't included in yours either.

&gt; Besides, you know full well what point I'm making and are just using this curriculum excuse to avoid answering it.

As far as I can tell you are either trying to suggest that, in terms of significance to RE, Scientology is on a par with Islam (which is simply incorrect), or you are trying to suggest that rather than do their jobs, teachers should teach whatever it is the children's parents want them to teach (which is just silly). And apologies if I'm using the ""excuse"" that teachers should do their job and stick to teaching what they are supposed to teach, but being a teacher myself it rather matters to me.

Is this before or after your fictional referendum?  If it's after, then wouldn't those civic services be replaced with Scottish civic services?  And I don't see how Portsmouth *should* have got it.  It was the only other place in the UK who could have built them, yes, but why does that mean they *should* have got them?

&gt;Scotland is going to look very different in ten years time even if it votes to stay thanks to events set in train by the SNP.

Damn right it will ;)

Are we? I've not heard anyone of the two main parties say anything to that effect, and they will be the ones to decide it.

&gt;If say, The Green Party or UKIP, only wins 1 or 2 seats despite getting more of the popular vote than every other party, heads will roll

That's a very extreme example, one that isn't ever going to occur.

&gt;A change in the voting system will come about when it becomes absolutely clear that the votes don't match the seats.

Party | % seats | % votes
---|---|----
Tory | 47.1 | 36.1
Lab| 39.7| 29
LD| 8.8 | 23

So LDs got only 6% less of the vote than Labour, but seat wise is a completely different story.

And the previous one...

Party | % seats | % votes
---|---|----
Tory | 30.7 | 32.4
Lab| 55.2| 35.2
LD| 9.6 | 22

Labour only got 3% more votes than the Tories, yet got a majority of the seats available. 2001 is the same story with Labour getting 40% of the vote, but got 62.5% of the seats. Labour lost 3 million votes between 1997 and 2001, but lost a total of 6 seats.

As a basic guide, the party with most votes gets into power, but the level of that power is completely out of kilter with those votes and has been for a while.

The policy for repayment should have been to mitigate the employer's loss not to deter the employee leaving.

It's one of the best looking buildings in the town these days, but prior to this it was black painted wood and white pebble dash, no sign of this lovely exterior.

It turned out the pebble dash was mounted on a frame as the front of the house hadn't been straight when it was put on yonks ago, before people had sense (and of course it was like that when it was listed, so although it wasn't how the house was intended to look, nobody had ever been able to change it), and therefore there was a dark damp space that the beetles had bred in and eaten most of the timber. The whole house slumped and the workmen had to put in metal props while they completed the work.

We had to find a proper carpenter, use the right kind of oak to replace the devoured timber, buy genuine windows that fit the era that had been removed from derelict properties, then use a particular type of plaster and whitewash to paint it afterwards.

I understand and fully agree with transfer commitees but everyone on that committee needs to be:

1. In football or have some good knowledge of it. Not just a businessman
2. Understand that flavor of the month players at other teams really only ever do well under that teams system
3. ACTUALLY agree with the philosophy of the manager involved because you can't go and get a big targetman striker when the Manager prefers to play with pace upfront. Not every player can fit the system correctly.

I fully also understand the moneyball philosophy on ""damaged goods"". Players like Suarez who was suspended in the Netherlands made him cheaper to buy or players like Coutinho who was a bench sitter at inter but signing players with shit attitude like Mario, who let's face it, if you remember him at Man City he was always in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, than it's not good for the team in general. I don't want to rag on the guy but the transfer committee should have seen that before signing him. 

Suarez had spotlight problems like Balotelli, but Suarez was never criticized or commented for being lazy or having a lack of commitment, Suarez would go out and play against Man United like it was the world cup final than go to the ""rainy day at stoke"" and give the same effort. I'd prefer to have a player with the mentality of Kuyt if he had the skills of Ngog than a player who plays like Messi but has the mentality of a sloth. 

Fans appreciate effort from players. If we finished 7th this season but showed a highly determined performance week in and out we'd probably have better spirits for next season and comment on how the squad is young and it can only get better rather than say the team is lackluster and hopeless.

Look at the polls. They are pointing clearly towards a Conservative govt.

Also the make-up in England is different to Scotland. England is a majority middle-class nation. Working classes are about 27% and completely outnumbered by about 60% middle-class and 13% upper class. England is *affluent*, and what's more, down here the working classes dearly want to become middle-class too, rather than hold onto some romantic idea of solidarity in poverty.

It looks very much like we're heading for a Conservative govt.

How are believers coerced if their same-sex neighbours are allowed to get married? How are they imposed on? Nobody is forcing them to have anything to do with their neighbours. Ok, if they run a business they will have to now serve LGBT couples. If that is problematic for them then even the bible says they should withdraw from the world. They may have to accept that others treat their neighbours like any other married couple. This is already the case with remarried couples for some Christians. I've never heard of a B&amp;B that refused divorcees or a wedding cake shop that asked for your marriage history, which leads me to the conclusion that some of the animus is not about high religious ideals but plain old intolerance. Just as the ending of miscegenation laws exposed underlying racism. That's one rule of marriage traditional Christians have now abandoned. Would you say that's a loss? The law must balance the rights of both parties, and the negative effects are larger for the neighbours. I don't believe churches should be targeted for their beliefs, but if you have churches like WBC using hateful incendiary language and behaviour, they will be done by as they do.

Lennon seems to promise so much at times but consistently fails to deliver a decent number of goals or assists. Huddlestone is a luxury player who stands out at Hull but was nothing special for us. Assou-Ekott's attitude was simply awful. With Dawson, the amount of times I saw people last season blaming him for defensive mistakes was huge so I find it amusing now that people are referring to him as a real loss to the defence after he scored one goal against Liverpool. Obviously with Caulker Tottenham didn't think he was as good as many people think he is and we decided to accept a good offer for him. I think we did very well getting the money we did for those players and having them in the team now wouldn't improve us in any way really. Most of the players we brought in are younger, more capable and have more potential. I think people look at those players with nostalgia and forget that they certainly had their faults and there's a reason we sold them.

&gt;In the UK, the Charity Commission for England and Wales ruled in 1999 that Scientology was not a religion and refused to register the Church as a charity, although a year later, it was recognized as a not-for-profit body in a separate proceeding by the UK Revenue and Customs and exempted from UK value added tax.[219][220] **In December 2013, the United Kingdom’s highest court officially recognized Scientology as a religion.** The ruling was a response to a five-year legal battle by Scientologist Louisa Hodkin, who legally fought for the right to marry at the Church of Scientology chapel in central London. Five supreme court justices redefined religion in law along with the ruling, rendering the 1970 ruling “out of date” in defining religious worship as involving “reverence or veneration of God or of a Supreme Being.”[221][222][223][224]

The problem at LFC is that for some reason a huge amount about what happens over transfers seems to come out in public. Just because Chelsea, City etc. are able to work and resolve disagreements internally doesn't mean they don't have these boards of people working on transfer targets - all big clubs do. It is wrong to single out LFC's and this only happens because there are a strange number of leaks.

This also makes it hard to establish how severe disagreements are. Almost all of this transfer committee talk is entirely reactionary (like 90% of fan discussion...) and the signings were widely lauded at the time. There is a complete lack of perspective on why players bought on low wages for moderate fees are not performing at the same level as players on huge wages and high transfer fees: they're just not as good.

Also, you can still claim the remittance basis even though the unremitted amount is over £2,000 and since you have only been resident for only one year there would be no annual charge.

It felt like they listened for something they understood, and upon hearing that only tried to help with that rather than the whole overall problem.

Then about 2 years ago I had a full breakdown on the way home from work, I sought help again, visited psychologist via the mental hospital (I don't know the P.C. name for it! :D ) and they refered me back to MIND (which iirc were now called something else) along with a slight change/increase to my medication.

I went along to meet the mind people again dreading they'd try and make me go through the same things again and instead I met a nice friendly young chap who was very easy to talk to, and it felt like he actually had some understanding of what I was describing.

He asked me if I was interested in self help courses online, or did I feel I needed to speak to someone directly (privately) or in a group. I said I wasn't sure but hadn't had much success previously with the online course.

He suggested I try a group course on mindfulness, and tbh it was the best thing I've ever done. It allowed me to view and think about things in a completely different way, but it wasn't until the 7th or 8th week this re-thinking (it was once a week attendance) actually started to make sense in my head. Until that point I kept thinking ""this course isn't touching the problems I face"", then there was some kind of sudden realisation and the feeling of I could change things *for me*.

2 years later and I've just spoken this morning to the doctor about dropping my extended dose back to normal, things are generally wonderful right now. :)

***COUGH***

&gt;""Excuse me. I had a difference to settle with the Iron Lady. That Thatcher, what an impossible woman!"" the president said as he arrived, more than 45 minutes late, on May 7 1982. ""With her four nuclear submarines in the south Atlantic, she's threatening to unleash an atomic weapon against Argentina if I don't provide her with the secret codes that will make the missiles we sold the Argentinians deaf and blind."" He reminded Mr Magoudi that on May 4 an Exocet missile had struck HMS Sheffield. ""To make matters worse, it was fired from a Super-Etendard jet,"" he said. ""All the matériel was French!""

&gt;In words that the psychoanalyst has sworn to the publisher, Meren Sell, are genuine, the president continued: ""She's livid. She blames me personally for this new Trafalgar ... I was obliged to give in. She's got them now, the codes.""

&gt;Mr Mitterrand - who once described Mrs Thatcher as ""the eyes of Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe"" - went on: ""One cannot win against the insular syndrome of an unbridled Englishwoman. Provoke a nuclear war for a few islands inhabited by three sheep as hairy as they are freezing! But it's a good job I gave way. Otherwise, I assure you, the Lady's metallic finger would have hit the button.""",null,0,null,1430321965,null,0,false,0,cqspydl,null,t3_348rd5,null,t1_cqspydl,null,t1_cqsjjjn,null,null,null,1432673338,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Generally you would need to find out whether whatever institution you have invested with in India have withheld tax on the interest. If they have, gross it up (add the tax back) and the gross amount should be taxed in the UK as normal. e.g so if you received £4k in interest, and they told you they had withheld 20% tax on the gross interest, the gross amount would be £5k.

Then you can reclaim some, most likely all, of the tax paid in India as a credit in the UK. This would be the way it would work on your UK tax return.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Posted this list the other day, but I'm adding justification because people seemed perplexed at some of them. **These are not swap deals**, just who I'd replace in the squad with a new signing or returning loanee.

* Lambert replaced by Lasogga (Hamburg, 23) or Di Santo (26, Werder Bremen)

Either of these two would be excellent third choice strikers. Lasogga was amazing at Hertha but has struggled at Hamburg, who look set for relegation. He'd be available on the cheap. Di Santo has been on fire at Bremen, but would cost considerably more and is getting first team football there.

* Borini replaced by Firmino (Hoffenheim, 22)

With the best will in the world, It's not working for Fabio. Firmino is probably one of the most in-demand players of this window and we'd have to battle United &amp; City for his signature, he plays in almost an identical role to the one Suarez played at Ajax. Not quite a second-striker, not quite a number 10. Scores regularly and made his national debut for Brazil with Coutinho. 

* Balotelli replaced by Origi (Loan at Lille 20)

Origi is younger, less volatile, has more potential going forward, it makes sense.

* Johnson replaced by Van Der Wiel (PSG, 27) or Byram (Leeds United, 21)

Van Der Wiel is surplus to requirements at PSG. They've just signed Aurier on a permanent deal. Slightly younger and less experienced, Sam Byram is rated incredibly highly by championship fans and is technically sound enough to have played at center midfield for Leeds. He's been on our radar for a while if we're to believe the rumour mill. 

* Toure replaced by Ilori (loan at Bordeaux, 22)

Yep.

* Gerrard replaced by Camacho (Malaga, 24) or Illaramendi (Real Madrid, 23)

I'm not fussy here, I just want a player who can actually defend to play at defensive midfield. Someone younger than Lucas who can keep the game flowing and break up the play of the opposition. Camacho and Illaramendi are both feasible targets, but both might cost a more than a fair amount. 

* Brad Jones replaced by Mat Ryan (Brugge, 23)

Aussie for Aussie. Ryan's distribution is extraordinary, quick to release the play and would be some decent competition for Mignolet.

* Aspas replaced by Dennis Praet (Anderlecht, 20)

Praet has bags of potential and could probably go back to Anderlecht on loan for a year or two, has 7 assists and 5 goals in 20 league appearances this year.

* Enrique replaced by Kolasinac (Schalke, 21)

I'll be honest, Kolasinac was someone I found out about through FIFA 15. He's quick and strong and from what I've seen in Youtube compilations, he's got a lot to offer, but perhaps we would want someone slightly more experienced to deputize for Moreno if he's out.

* Tiexeira replaced by Konoplyanka (Dnipro, 25) or Depay (PSV, 21)

It's sad really because had he not picked up a horrible injury with Brighton, he'd probably have made some pre-season games with us, but if not in the summer, I think he'll be shipped off by January. Kono is going on a free transfer. I really hope we've already signed him, but that's incredibly optimistic. Depay would be an excellent signing and if we can beat United to him, we should definitely try. He's got 21 goals in 28 appearances. We'd be in a much better position with those 21 goals.

null,false,inquisitivinatorer,lfc99,,null,"In:

1. Milner: On a free, is massively experienced and can play quite a few positions. Better than some of our other options. 

2. Danny Ings: Can leave on a free also (although I think we will need to pay a small fee). Still young enough to have a resale value if he doesn't succeed and is better than Borini and Lambert. 

3. A good to World class Striker: The biggest thing we have lacked this season is a potent scorer and this is where we need to improve the most. Who this player is I have no idea, a perfect player would be Benzema but that's never going to happen. 

4. A good to world class DM: One of the major issues for our side is not having Lucas available all the time and that leaves us weak in midfield, also with rumours that he is to leave this Summer we definitely need to strengthen in this area, hopefully someone experienced that can interchange with Can.

5. An experienced CB: with Kolo likely to leave this Summer and the preference to get Can playing as a Midfielder we need to get at least one more CB. 

6. Right Back: With Johnson likely to be leaving we need another RB, hopefully someone experienced for Flanagan and Manquillo to learn from. With those two waiting in the wings (if Flanagan can stay fit and Manquillo signs permanently) I think we should go for someone for the short term, Alves or Arbeloa perhaps? 

7. LB: With Enrique not able to stay fit or get a game when he is we need someone to challenge Moreno. 

8. Back-up GK: I feel Mignolet has proven that with the right defence in front of him and a bit of confidence he can definitely be a good enough GK for us, but we do need to replace Jones who quite frankly isn't good enough even as a back-up. Maybe someone younger to mould into a future first team keeper? 

Out:

1. Free Transfers: just getting them out of the way, Gerrard, Johnson, Kolo? And Jones? Will be the players to leave on a free this year, I think that is all of them. 

2. Balotelli: Abysmal season, clearly doesn't suit the Managers tactics so there's no point hanging on when we can free up space for players that do. 

3. Borini: why he didn't just leave to Sunderland or QPR last Summer I do not know, that would have been a very good £14m for us. But it is still very obvious that he isn't going to be utilised at Liverpool so he should go, although it will most certainly be for a lot less than the offers last year. 

4: Lucas: I would prefer to keep him, but he is just injured too often and I feel at this point we could probably get someone better and more reliable. 

5. Enrique: I love the guy, but he can't seem to get a game at all now so he might as well be sold and bring in someone we will use. 

Now this is a lot of change to the squad so I don't expect all of it to happen otherwise we will have another year of 'transition'. But the main one is to get a good Striker and DM in my opinion. I have also seen a lot of people saying we should sell Lambert, but he is a decent experiences striker that doesn't cost a lot and doesn't mind being on the bench so for that alone I think he is worth keeping around a bit longer. 

Edit: sorry for the editing, I'm on mobile.

In addition to the above, Brendan is a very hands on sort of manager that spends a lot of time on the training pitch.  He's an excellent coach, no one could or should deny that, but that sort of time commitment on his part (and I'm not advocating on him spending less!) means that other items fall by the wayside- namely ability to scout, identify and work with the transfer committee we have and the ability to integrate/evaluate/provide direction to the Academy teams as he simply doesn't have time.

I think Rodgers had this idea that he would come into Liverpool and run it in a similar manner to what he did at Swansea or Reading, but reality is Liverpool is orders of magnitude in terms of scale the size of those others- greater than £200M in revenue versus around £70M at Swansea, 500+ employees versus around 200 or so.  Liverpool is simply, in my opinion, too big for any one individual to manage as a sole entity and it was massively unfair to Rodgers (whether he realizes it or not) to expect him to be able to cover all areas that he should be to a high level of standard.  Managers like Wegner and Ferguson are able to do so as they function in reality more as a hybird Director of Football/Manager themselves spending less time on the training pitch and allowing the First Team Coaches to effectively run a lot of the day to day management of the first team but given Rodgers' hands-on nature that's not really feasible.

If Rodgers had himself advocated for someone to step in and fill that role, it would have allowed for a few advantages:

1) It would have replaced the committee with perhaps something a little more streamlined and more commonly used

2) Rodgers would/could have been heavily involved in the recruitment of said individual

3) Part of 2 above, but Rodgers would have been able to identify whether that individual was someone he could work with and that they share similar playing philosophies

TL;DR:  I think Rodgers should have pushed FSG to appoint a DoF/Sporting Director/Technical Director himself last summer.",null,0,null,1430324628,null,0,false,0,cqsrq0i,null,t3_34a42p,null,t1_cqsrq0i,null,t3_34a42p,null,null,null,1432674171,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

Yeah it was an older squad on high wages but we gutted the core of that team and replaced them with shit. Hodgson started the shit transfers, and even after he was replaced we built a team to feed Carroll headers all match long.

Then Rodgers built the team around Suarez again and got us playing like the last half of the 2010 season again with a younger squad. Now Suarez is gone and we just purchased a lot of players that have no idea what they're doing going forward with Sturridge perpetually injured. Guess the plan is to either give it to Coutinho and rely on him to do something magical, or let Sterling dribble in to the defense all game.

We have no counter attack, our build up is slow and predictable. Our best attacking threat has no left foot (Sterling) and is easily defended now, which means if Coutinho or Henderson aren't scoring then no one is. Our strikers have netted 8 goals all campaign.

This isn't quite true. Economic growth doesn't scale directly with government spending. If you cut government spending by 5% you won't see a 5% fall in GDP, just as if you increase government spending by 5% you won't see a 5% increase in GDP. It is possible to reduce/eliminate a deficit through spending cuts alone. It's not necessarily a sensible way to do things, but it is certainly possible.

&gt; then as you come out of recession and the private sector is ready to take over you can start cutting government spending

The one item I would like to see us focus on more is buying (generically) players in the 21-24 year old range rather than the 18-21 year old range.  If you look at some of our notable successes, say Sturridge or Suarez, they came into the side when they were in that range and, for me, that's the age grouping where players are typically transitioning from prospect to not quite world class.  There are exceptions (say Coutinho or Sterling) who are capable at a younger age, but in general I do wish the transfer committee/Rodgers/scouts would focus more on the older youth, if you will- players like Lacazette at 23 rather than Origi at 20, or Son Heung-Min at 22 versus Markovic at 20, Rode at 23 instead of Can at 20, etc.  Perhaps not the best examples, but hopefully you get my meaning.",null,0,null,1430325765,null,0,false,0,cqssh5m,null,t3_34a42p,null,t1_cqssh5m,null,t1_cqsrd8i,null,null,null,1432674527,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

1. I think the 3-4-3 did well for 2 main reasons. It solidified our 'defence' by offering more of a defensive hustle. i.e. the 2 CMs both had defensive duties of leading the press, as well as off the ball we formed almost into a back 5. This gave us a solid platform to defend and break from as the 3 up top were always ready to break. A larger reason is not because of the formation but because of injuries. It forced BR to drop Gerrard, Johnson and Lovren who were all playing atrociously at the time and this forced him to play to strenghts of the our key players. i.e. Coutinho Sterling and Hendo. Another reason I guess could be that no-one really expected us to play that formation at the beginning, and eventually it did get found out [the first I recall being Swansea away where we really did struggle]
2. We played a 4-4-2. Suarez was unstoppable so everything was moulded around him. His passion was infectious. Our team last season was the football incarnation of the word gung-ho. Our attack was crazy, suarez's movement and motivation created so much space because other teams were confused as to how to defend against him. Only a few times was he really silenced last season, one being Chelsea at home. You had to be ridiculously well drilled to hold in our 3 Sturridge suarez and sterling. But credit where credit is due BR was the one to tactically set up our team to encourage that style of play, couldnt have been done without his belief in our players and that style.
3. All depends on who we can bring in. With our current squad I feel we should either play a form of 4-4-2 or 4-4-3 with a fluid front 3. If we can bring in a world class striker and CM then I'd consider 4-5-1 but until then I dont think it can work with our team.",null,0,null,1430325930,null,0,false,0,cqssl7w,null,t3_34afws,null,t1_cqssl7w,null,t3_34afws,null,null,null,1432674581,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

The GIF you linked is not similar to the Kronwall hit, at all really.  

That's a hit from Palat where the principle point of contact happens to be the head.  The Kronwall hit is objectively charging, and to me, looks like there is intent to injure.  This one isn't charging, and doesn't look like there in intent to injure. 

Player history is important to the NHL.  Kronwall has a well documented history of iffy 50/50 hits, and is well known to seek out a big hit  (which in itself is fringing the rules of professional hockey). Palat has absolutely no similar history whatsoever. 

&gt; You're not going to suspend Byfuglien or Subban for what they did, but this get a game? 

I'm not really certain what you or this poster is thinking.  The plays likely referred to there are nothing remotely similar to what Kronwall did.   Kronwalls hit is just downright dangerous, and it's not an *accident* while I doubt anybody other than a Red Wrings fan could legitimately claim Palat is trying to headshot Glendenning.  

(I don't mean to say that Kronwall means to headshot- I mean to say that Kronwall intentionally charges, which he does, and that is dangerous.  He does it all the time, and rightly so isn't suspended 99.999% of the time, but when you play on that edge, stuff like this is going to happen).

For Suárez, I believe we often ended up running a 4-4-2 diamond. Our two at the top, SaS, were so successful last season that they were able to more than make up for deficiencies at the back (we ended up letting in about as many goals as we've scored this season while scoring double that). Running Gerrard as a pivot and having him distribute out from the back also helped a ton until it was found out late on.

As for next season, who knows? It'll all really end up depending on who comes in over the summer.

Well for one I'd dispute that. His inability to discuss anything other than immigration and the EU at debates suggests he is unwilling to voice his opinions about other issues in open debate, and would much rather focus on a small number of issues he knows he has support on. 

&gt;Combine that attitude with aggressive, agenda-driven, nasty-soundbite-hunting journalism and establishment spin and you're likely to have some mishaps like the ones you described.

Again, as I said at the time, a journalist pushing a politician isn't 'aggressive, nasty-soundbite-hunting journalism and establishment spin', it's good journalism. I'd rather a politician was hounded into voicing their true opinions than constantly thrown easy questions which they can avoid. And that goes for politicians I support as well. 

&gt; How exactly would you like Farage to promote his (perfectly valid and not racist, whether or not you agree with him) anti mass-immigration views without occasionally “sounding racist” when a lot of clever and influential people want to paint him in that light?

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"For anyone else interested, I wrote this some time back when people were asking about why the back 3 was so efficient:

Our defensive structure has changed to a back 3/5 and this means that each individual player has far less space to cover. The sheer number at the back means that we can stop most attacks more often than not. Before, with 4 at the back, we made erratic decision making due to the middle pair not being coached when to step and when not to. We couldn't react to certain and fairly obvious triggers, EG: Tracking a man running into the box (See Clyne's goal in the first game of the season). From using the back 3/5, the back line can sort itself out (it doesn't require much coaching organisational wise). We're lucky that we have Skrtel in our back as our sweeper, because there are not many players in the premier league who stand up as well as he can when we're up against the wall. Skrtel's weaknesses, which are apparent, are minimized hugely as his sole responsibility is to mop up anything that goes through, IE: He doesn't have to control as much space individually (something which he isn't the greatest at). It also fills Sakho/Can/Lovren with confidence knowing that if they do mess up, Skrtel's right behind them to help out. The outside CB's are great outlets with the ball, rarely making mistakes and the wing backs know that if they mess up, the CB's on the side sort it out. Also, unlike last season, we don't need someone dropping in to CB and thus splitting them apart, because as mentioned before, Sakho and Can are great outlets of the ball and pass confidently into midfield. As a result of this, his job (Lucas/Allen) is far easier covering the space between the midfield 5 and the back 3. Also, as Carragher mentioned on Sky Sports, although teams can exploit the space between the outside CB and the wingbacks, generally Moreno, Markovic and Ibe can hold their own in a 1 v 1 (which Rodgers is big on). Finally, this formation suits Mignolet to a tee, as he no longer has to behave like a sweeper keeper (which Rodgers tried hard on doing) as Skrtel is almost always there.
