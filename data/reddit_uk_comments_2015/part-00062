Let's say then that we have issues in the midfield (shocking assumption I know) and we have to push can into CM because Gerrard leaves for hollywood and Lucas isn't fit. This leaves Henderson and Joe Allen playing out of position as a DCM. So, Can steps in and pushes Henderson up to his rightful position. So, our back two of Sakho and Skrtel now has Lovren step in. Let's make a giant hypothetical leap and say Lovren has an amazing resurgence and they all pair well. Can at CDM and a commanding back three. Sounds amazing right? Let's say one gets injured. Someone steps on Skrtel's head - Sakho has another hamstring injury.. you get the idea. Our choices become Flanigan, Johnson, Manquillo, Moreno, and Enrique. In terms of a stout back three, Enrique is the only one of those that I'd feel comfortable putting back there and he's already proven to not only be poor in the air, but injury prone himself. If you put Kolo in, you may not be incredibly excited about the potential for more goals, but he's not going to make mistakes and he's going to command control in the back. Would I want him for a champs league run? Damn straight. I want him on the bench to cool heads and maintain composure. He's been a great replacement for Carra. Is Flanigan the future back there? Maybe, we all want him to be - but he's a 4-4-2 kind of guy, just like Manquillo and Moreno. If we get rid of johnson as expected, This guy shouldn't hit our books too hard, especially since he signed on a free. Plus, I don't expect Can to stay back on defense nor do I expect to keep both Manquillo and Moreno. There's a spot for him and bonus, the fan's love him.

Honestly as much as some other videos disgust me, this one just had me laughing my ass off after a point due to the idiocy of both sides of the argument and not even listening to what each other are saying.

She didn't actually say ""you guys used to be slaves"" in any offensive way as in having a jab as black people because of it.

What *actually* happened is that she was taking issue with how much of a problem the dude had with her - she was of the opinion that he'd made some big deal out of nothing before that. So she said that (in her opinion) some black people get overly-angry and assume the worst at the smallest things *because of* the history of slavery, black rights, racism, etc.

That's hardly hate speech - and there are plenty of people who do act a certain way and vehemently stand up for themselves due to this history (and present day racism too) - and there are cases where people assume the worse and that someone is being offensive when they are actually not because of that. That could easily be what happened here - she did something (not racist), but he overreacts (calls her racist), and she defends herself by saying he's overreacting due to the history of black people and racism.

I mean this dude is shouting ""did you just call me a slave!? did you just call me a slave!? did you just call me a slave!?"" - she actually didn't didn't, AT ALL, in the slightest little bit!

I'd say that in all probability this woman isn't racist, but she has an issue with certain attitudes. And she clearly doesn't think before blurting stuff out - I can't imagine why she just kept going on and on but she clearly doesn't like to back down or lose and argument or not have the last word.

null,false,Kingofthegnome,null,null,null,I was always interested in a time war story that stars with the resurrection of The Master. They could use his ignorance of the situation to help the viewer learn more about whats going on in the time war and the politics of gallifrey. Maybe they could task The Master with going planet to planet trying to collect old Time Lord artifacts to build an ultimate weapon that could help in the time war. Maybe throughout the series he could get a sidekick orphaned child 8-10 years old on one of the planets named Yana. At first he would hate the child and responsibility but the kid would keep following him until he felt for the child and became like a father figure. We can watch him slowly become more and more like The Doctor as we hear stories about the War Doctor committing atrocities in the time war. The series could end with the Master finally giving into his humanity then suddenly having everything taken away from him. Watching his child companion who ultimately became like a son to him die at the hands of the daleks when collecting the last piece of the artifact in zero hour. The delay of him mourning his lost he is unable to obtain the last piece of the artifact and because of this delay he is close enough to then watching gallifrey destroyed. In a last ditch effort he goes mad and kills all remaining daleks and destroying hundreds of worlds full of aliens life committing a mass genocide of worlds. In a last ditch effort he tries to travel back in time to save the child as but he soon learns that the destruction of gallifrey starts a chain reaction that time locks that moment. The last scene could be of The Master bringing the body of the boy back to his village on a planet now dying because of the time lords and the master. Seeing the destruction he caused. Seeing poor starving children that remind him of the boy that made him see what humanity really was. The last scene could be him burring the boy alone breaking down over what he has done and all he has lost. The last moment he could whip away his tears as he takes his pocket watch out of his pocket and chooses to forget.,null,0,null,1424151419,null,0,1424181067,0,convkl7,null,t3_2vv7oa,null,t1_convkl7,null,t3_2vv7oa,null,null,null,1424633514,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

I would suggest that Facebook and Twitter could be very valuable tools in marketing your website forum/news site. Set up a Facebook page for it and then spread it around on local groups and pages to promote it. A lot of groups won't tolerate you just posting links, they'll think it's spam, so come to arrangements with page and group owners for local Spotted, for sale pages and other localised pages and groups. I'm sure a few will be willing to cooperate to a degree. 

Also, have a Twitter account shortlinking article titles and link with appropriate hashtags and I'm sure you'll find people clicking on it often enough for it to be familiar over time. It may take a lot of time... But so long as you have consistent relevant content and a social media presence. It could work man.

Ideally you'd extend this to say under 30s. And it'd work thus:

Young person finds themselves unemployed - either after finishing some sort of schooling, or through redundancy. First point of contact is Universal Credit online - *yes, let's assume in this fantasy they actually get it working* - and they'd make their initial claim online; the system generating a 'face to face' appointment at their local JCP, to confirm the details.

At said meeting, a CV would be expected to be procured from the new claimant; based on it, plus an 'experience survey' conducted during the initial claim, the member of staff from the would them be able to see if there's any immediate support needs that are flagged up.

Lack of computer skills? Roll them onto a basic computer course - i.e. ECDL or an equivalent. CV not upto scratch? Plug the data into a system that generates a generic 'Government approved™' CV - if further help is needed, roll 'em onto an in-house course that covers customising cover letters for each roll, and CV tweeking - i.e. writing a cover letter and spec' your CV based on information gleaned from each job listing.

One that's done, you **work with the claimant** to secure a three month - **expenses covered** placement in a local community focused company who work in an area the claimant wants to get into. At a company that's been accredited by the DWP as being able to provide that person with skills and experience that will boost their chances at getting into work / back into work.

Upon completion, issue the claimant with a 'work in the community' type qualification - a mini-mini NVQ of sorts.

Alternatively, if the claimant - and the JCP - agree together that such a placement wouldn't be in the claimants best interests, at least not initially - they roll out a universal jobmatch account; set a **manageable** target and continue to review their progress on a weekly basis.

If, after three months they're no closer to getting into work, then look again at a placement.

That's just off the top of my head, at 7 in the morning, groggy before heading out - I'm sure with a bit of thought a scheme could be devised that'd actually be progressive, adaptive, and useful.

As opposed to the scheme IDS and Co. want to roll-out, which as with the last one they proposed, sounds like a good way to fill all those council jobs that are being cut. Need someone to pick up litter / cut the grass? Why the fuck pay someone a salary and pension contributions, when you can get someone to do it for their dole.

I imagine this thread will generate some interesting views - I look forward to reading 'em this evening.

&gt;Us scoring two goals against Barcelona with just 10 men was pure luck? You are full of shit, you don't even give credit to our defending.

its not about our defending you twit im talking about the numerous close calls and the penalty messi missed. The tactic does not work, it worked once in the CL it doesnt mean we have to park the bus and try and imitate the performances with a manager who had less than half a year with us, who had a weaker side. 

This whole conversation wouldnt exist if you had basic comprehension skills. Im not attacking ""defending"" im not attacking the way we won the CL. Im not saying it doesnt take skill. 
**I am saying for the FINAL TIME that parking the bus is extremely risky and you are welcoming attack after attack after attack.

You are essentially trying to do the classic 'nice guy' thing of liking the girl as more than a friend, and trying to create some grand situation in which you reveal your feelings.

It just doesn't work.

The girl invariably realizes that she's been manipulated into the situation, and that you haven't been honest with your intentions and lack the confidence to be honest. That's a killer.

This is why assholes sometimes get the girl. They're confident, and honest about who they are.

You don't have to become an asshole, but you have to become honest and at least have the confidence to be honest.

Drop the grandiose Doctor Who plans. 

Just tell her that you find her kind/intelligent/pretty/etc. and have started to become interested in her potentially as more than just a friend, but aren't sure if she could potentially see you as more than a friend, and if so, how well you'd click together, so you'd like to go out for coffee/dinner (no movie) with her to see if you might have chemistry together.

Quit obsessing about it. Quit thinking about it. Quit doubting yourself. Just do it.

Chances are, you'll get shot down. But you'll at least have a shot, which you won't with the Doctor Who plan, and if you do get shot down, you can move on that much quicker.

null,false,chunkyknit,null,null,null,"We  bought our first home last year. Here's a couple of tips:

Consider a home buyers report instead of a basic survey. It's about £500 but the surveyor will identify the real value of the house. Ours identified that the market value of the house was 10k below our offer, allowing us to renegotiate the price and pay 10k less

Use a mortgage broker but also check a few banks such as hsbc etc as not all of them go through the brokers (we didn't do this and I still wonder if we could have made a saving) 

If it's your first home you might be able to negotiate keeping the white goods, making life much easier when you're in

If it's a terrace or semi here's something basic but easily missed, and cost us time and money. Check the house is simple straight us and down with no areas overhanging onto the neighbouring property. Even to the point that you measure the width of each level. When you have an overhang it is called a Flying Freehold, and it can be a mighty pain in the ass. 

If there is an overhang on either side you should make it the first thing your solicitor looks into. Before any searches or surveys. Most properties are registered based on their footprint not the elevation, flying freeholds need a note on the land registry to explain how the land is shared. If the note isn't there than the vendors solicitors will need to contact the neighbours solicitors to hash out the terms and suddenly you're reliant on a completely unknown third partner and three sets of solicitors.

We had the worst case scenario in this situation with a house. We didn't spot the problem until the day before exchanging. It was then a 5 month wait while the neighbour obstructed the sale. Eventually we had to pull out and lost about £800 in surveys and searches. With the house we did buy in the end we were right in measuring everything to be sure on our second viewing!

Good luck! Have patience! Owning a house is the best!

&gt;Throughout his travels in time and space, the Doctor took and was called by a number of different __aliases__, __titles__ and __names__. Some were fleeting. Others, for example __John Smith__, were used by almost all of his incarnations. The Doctor told few individuals his real name. Instead, he asked others to call him __the Doctor__.

Since she isn't that invested in it, your big reveal that ""See, I'm your Rory, you just haven't realized..."" will fall extremely flat.

Let it go.


Stop being passive and just tell her how you feel. Even if she doesn't feel the same, she'll think more of you for being upfront with it and not hiding behind metaphors for protection. 
It's entirely possible that you feel ""She only see's me as a friend"" simply because you've never given her reason to think otherwise. 
It's more likely however, that she just isn't attracted to you like that, as females have no qualms about hinting at wanting more when they do, these hints will persist until you crack. Since she isn't hinting, and doesn't seem invested in the show... Let it go, you're just friends.

null,false,TechJesus,null,null,null,"&gt; I agree, it is plausible that everything comes down to 'luck'. And if so, we obviously can't hope to neutralise the impact of luck on the quality of a persons life: that would mean equalising everybody's quality of life completely. Because if there is any inequality, it will be attributable to 'luck', even if that 'luck' is somebody choosing to work harder despite coming from a less advantaged background (for we can start to attribute that effort to their genes, parents, and so on). So the whole egalitarian project begins to look a little futile, and perhaps undesirable.
&gt; 
&gt; But, if you take a few steps backwards, you can still observe the obviously unfair impact of the more obvious elements of 'luck' and try to address them: you can ensure that state education for the poorest is very good, you can provide lots of services for the disabled, you can provide healthcare to the poor, you can you can raise money for these things by taxing the lucky (those blessed with good genes, parents, education, etc).

I think there's a difference between providing a high basic standard of education, healthcare and so on, against trying to make everybody equal. Perhaps the greatest challenge in left-wing politics has always been to strike a balance between freedom and equality. The relationship between the two is complicated, but I think the progressive side of the left (as opposed to the liberal side) is now driving towards more state intervention to level things – inspired in large part by the Nordic model of politics.

As a rule I think freedom creates inequalities, and I think enforcing equality will infringe on freedoms. Clearly a balance will have to be struck, but where that ideal balance lies will be largely a matter of opinion.

Indeed. Christian Zionism is a real thing, where the concept of supersessionism is ignored by the group aiding in the return of the state of Israel, something of which America had a major role in doing once Britain abandoned defending it post-war. Which, itself, this Christian Zionism, can be contentious. 

Although it's the members of the New Covenant supporting the return of the Jews to their homeland, apparently ignoring the fact that all are meant to be Christian, one problem is the fact that the Temple must be rebuilt so that Antichrist can declare himself God and massacre Jews (before being raised by the Lord).

This isn't without Christian, nor American criticism. It brings the notion that the American support of Israel is the Americans 'using' the Jews to gain acceptance by God, but also the fact it ends with America supporting extremist policies that the Jewish State must aim towards, e.g. that land cannot be given up. America views itself as the Elect Nation, as the superpower that oversees the spreading of peace and protection of nations.
&gt;'God’s covenant land is Israel’s and not to be traded for promises of peace and security. Furthermore, those nations who sponsor ‘land for peace’ efforts will continue to be judged. The US should stop the sponsorship of 'land for peace'... If the United States doesn’t do this, further devastation will come to America' -(William Koenig)

American support for Israel was criticised quite a bit, but this declined post-9/11. Ronald Reagan though, even said this in 1971:
&gt;Ezekiel tells us that Gog, the nation that will lead all of the other powers of darkness against Israel, will come out of the north. Biblical scholars have been saying for generations that the Gog must be Russia. What other powerful nation is to the north of Israel? None. But it din't seem to make sense before the Russian revolution, when Russia was a Christian country. Now it does, now that Russia has become communistic and atheistic, now that Russia has set itself against God. Now it fits the description of Gog perfectly. 

---
&gt;For the first time ever, everything is in place for the battle of Armageddon and the second coming of Christ.

It all adds up to the overall picture of American apocalyptic thought and politics, especially Cold War era, but also recently with dispensational groups and millennial movements. Even today, it's not just an issue in politics, but also religion.

And then further to the point you made about Jews not necessarily being Zionist, that's something as well people should realise. Jews looking to the Holocaust have criticised it by the lack of Zionism that was embraced by the Jews, to others saying that it was Zionism that led to punishment such as the Holocaust.

I shall leave my post at that for now, even though I could delve into the theology of Rabbis regarding the Holocaust.

This is where I run in to a problem.  I've seen and experienced some of the worst the public school system can generate, from rampant bullying through to victim blaming (and shaming) through to disruptive pupils who could not be expelled outright destroying classroom after classroom (and injuring people in the process).  Drugs, teen pregnancies... my school had it all. 

So my take on it is that IF we were offering children the absolute best scholastic environment, a safe place to learn, every tool we could muster from non-overworked and engaged teaching staff through to a well stocked library and a healthy meal at lunch then yes some degree of paying it forward/back/sideways could be reasonably justified.

Essentially...

The match against QPR is a Class A game and a London derby. That means the cheapest ticket you can get is for £35. However, to purchase a ticket you need to be a season ticket holder or a member. I'm assuming you're not a member, so you'll need to buy a membership along with the ticket.

You can buy both a membership and a ticket at the same time from the [CPFC Ticket website](https://www.cpfctickets.com/). I'm assuming you're not living in England, so you're probably looking at paying £40 for a membership and £40 for a ticket. That's £80 total.

If you don't want to go the official route you can check out Holmesdale.net's [Ticket &amp; Travel Talk](http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=105&amp;fid=3). This is a CPFC fan forum where fans sometimes sell tickets at face value (i.e. for how much they bought the ticket for). Be warned though: sellers usually want buyers to have active account history on the site itself.

Other than that, you have your other non-official means of getting a ticket: scalpers around the ground. But use them at your discretion and own risk.

Taking it in tax effectively removes it from the capital wealth of the economic cycle reducing the amount of money in circulation, meaning people can't spend it meaning reductions in cycles which create jobs. People with large inheritances are more likely to start businesses and generate economic activity. We also have limited savings in general in this country because the government at present wants people to spend to create the illusion of growth, so any unspent money is sought in insanely punitive taxation to keep that going.

If your points are true why then are working farms exempt from inheritance tax?

All this bullshit is just an excuse for letting the education system's and health systems go to hell. If you buy into the party rhetoric on tax being a moral issue you are an instrument of the destruction of social mobility that we once enjoyed.

&gt;Until the latter part of the 18th century, time was normally determined in each town by a local [sundial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial). [Solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time) is calculated with reference to the relative position of the sun. This provided only an approximation as to time due to variations in orbits and had become unsuitable for day-to-day purposes. It was replaced by local mean time, which eliminated the variation due to seasonal differences and anomalies. It also took account of the [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude) of a location and enabled a precise time correction to be applied.

Wembley/ Neasden itself is a industrial area and there are few hotels until you get further out to Harrow. Heathrow has the piccadilly line direct to kings cross, probably 45 mins to an hour. You can get a bus to Harrow from the airport for £2, and it stops outside a hotel in Harrow called Cumberland. This is the least glamour option. Harrow is the next stop on the tube to Wembley Park, five minutes. 

Beer wise, we have the Torch pub designated but the chances of getting a beer will be slim. But there will be a lot of singing, and thousands of us in there. It's literally on the left as you exit wembley park, chelsea have been given the green man which is actually on top of a mountain on the other side of the stadium. If you keep your ear to the ground we may be given the Globe in Baker Street, not sure yet. Get the tube to Baker Street and its outside the station. Same underground line, just a stop for a beer. Plus, the singing in the train from Baker Street is the most fun I've ever had going to Wembley. 

Gatwick and stanstead are a long way out. There are flights from London City which is a business airport and central ish. It's on the docklands railway, so you stay on the underground system. Operators like Vueling.com go from there direct to most European cities for good prices. There are shuttle trains to the airports but you may as well go back to heathrow in my opinion. City airport is the best option, you'll just have to use the tube but it's not hard. Go to Bank station from kings cross, get on the dlr, head to city airport. 

Ticket wise, no idea sorry.

When it comes to litter is there an underlying reason for it?  Are the existing bins insufficient for the task, not being emptied regularly enough or some other reason?

The quickest way to Stansted would be to take the Stantsed express train from Liverpool St station. Trains to Gatwick I'm fairly sure run from Victoria Station. Each should only take about an hour. You could probably try megabus or someone similar if you want to save a bit of money.  
  
When it comes to tickets, then it could be a tad trickier, I think you just have to see and trust your gut on it tbh. Hopefully you don't find someone trying to screw you over. The only other official option there is would be to go via Club Wembley (https://clubwembley.wembleystadium.com/) Which are essentially neutral seats and fancy seats at the stadium, I'm not sure of the cost because they keep it pretty quiet how much it would be, but from what I've hard at least £350ish.

The taxpayers get something out of it too: a safety net. I've had a full time job for the past 5 years and have never been on welfare. If I had the option of not paying taxes for welfare, I'd still do it because I appreciate that safety net. I don't just see it as paying taxes for other people (which I don't consider a bad thing anyway), I see it as paying for peace of mind for myself.

&gt;This works out. It's not perfect, it's not a job, but it's not nothing.

It is a job though. It's just not being compensated like one. If there's work to be done and people to do it, why not just, you know, pay them for doing it?

Yeah, and we have laws against crimes, but they still happen. The question is how far we should go in order to stamp out such things. There's a point where the system becomes unfair and begins to target those who need help  the most. The JSA is being treated as though every single claimant is guilty until proven innocent, and *even then* they're not safe from being shamelessly whored off to private companies for cheap labour.

&gt; And nobody is being forced to work against their will. They are being offered an exchange. Money for labour. Not much money for too much labour, maybe. But it's an offer, not a sentence. One made not out of need for employee's, but as a public service.

It's not an offer if you get sanctioned for refusing. What comes after that? Why don't we just arrest the unemployed if it's causing us this much grief?

That's £3 and £3.5 (roughly) an hour each if 20 hours Community service were to be a requirement! That's ridiculous.

As has been mentioned right at the top of this thread, it's an excuse for Government to reduce labour costs. If there is a job to be done, give the person seeking a job full employment to do that work on minimum wage, don't force them to do it for half the go rate until they find something better.

And the time issue that /u/nunnible is more than just the time it takes to look for work. Scheduling interviews if 20hours a week, plus travel (at your own cost so that's eating into your £60 a week) so likely near 25/30 hours a week are being taken up with work.

If 5hours out of your day are being taken up travelling to, working and travelling back from a community service job, how are you going to fit an interview in anywhere?

Few companies will be kind enough to work their schedule to yours, and theres already enough stories of people being sanctioned for missing Job Centre appointments when they were off at interviews. Imagine missing any Community Service work in place of a job interview.

And on top of all that you need to fit the rest of your life into in. Maybe it's a course, maybe it's looking after a family member, picking kids up, visiting a sick mum, doing your shopping with what little money you have left over ... get completely demoralised at every turn because not only can you barely afford to live, you can't find work and you're being forced to do a job for pocket money.

There's also the danger that something like this could set a president for requiring something in return for other benefits.  You have said in a previous comment that you expect something in return for someone receiving a Govt benefit. Granted that's in relation to job seekers, but give it 5, 10 years and you or people that hold similar opinions may start to to question why we aren't forcing those on child benefit to work, or income support or pensioners to work.

To look at the pensioners example, the counter argument would be that most they have spent their lives contributing to society and NI so sure they can draw from it.  Well we need to support people out of work so they can get back into a position where they can contribute until retirement.  Without the support to get back into work, further and deeper problems arise and that is what JSA is meant to help prevent.

Chief of all though, I think we need to stop expecting that it's ok to pay people next to nothing to do a job, whether it be working for benefits, mandatory job placements whilst on benefits, ""apprenticeships"" for menial jobs that are short term contracts with zero qualifications or jobs at the end.

edit: well, it seems my hypothesis has been proved correct

Now this - http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/ministers-are-reaching-beyond-scroungers-and-aiming-britain-s-working-poor

&gt;Sanctions can apply of claimants working less than 35 hours a week on minimum wage (typically £12,000 a year) who do not comply with the scheme. Failure may include failing to attend ‘job focused interviews’ or failing to apply for a job that might bring in extra hours. Welfare reform minister Lord David Freud says ""tougher"" conversations will be had with claimants after two months.

&gt;For claimants, one of the most worrying aspects of the programme – called work related requirements – is that it can apply to housing benefit (technically the housing cost element of universal credit). That’s potentially a chunk of your rent lost to the DWP if you do not take active steps to get a better-paid job.

So now, even if you're working, it might not be enough for the Government! Really, what the fuck do they expect people to on that are in low paid work? Not everyone can move up the ladder.

After working in groups for a while you can give them comtrol and power to expand. Soon you will have the makings of a company and with support things could take off, or at least lessons would be learnt - because let's face it, jobs going at the moment are crap, I've been looking myself - and a better opportunity than any going at the moment.

I've had to cut all the fun things (pub, smoking, trips to friends around the UK) and between writing CVs and jumping through hoops and resting a piece of ham on my nose for any support off the government.

Failure may include failing to attend ‘job focused interviews’ or failing to apply for a job that might bring in extra hours. Welfare reform minister Lord David Freud says ""tougher"" conversations will be had with claimants after two months.

&gt; For claimants, one of the most worrying aspects of the programme – called work related requirements – is that it can apply to housing benefit (technically the housing cost element of universal credit). That’s potentially a chunk of your rent lost to the DWP if you do not take active steps to get a better-paid job.

&gt;The pilot starts in April and if successful, the government intends to roll the scheme out for most universal credit claimants. Data comparison from the DWP's Stat Xplore shows that 1,078,413 people in Britain are claiming housing benefit and in work – meaning they are likely to be on low salaries. That’s more than 1m working people who could potentially be affected by the policy if the reform is rolled out with universal credit.

Okay, so community service. How about this: if a person cannot find work in the usual 6 months of searching, they get admitted onto a list. The govt then uses this list for labour for various projects, providing transport and training. You are not at risk of losing your benefits if you refuse to do any specific project, however once signed up you're essentially on a short term contract with all the problems thereof if contract breached.
They must get paid at least minimum wage, and must not be abused as free labour.

The idea then would be to assist people to get back into work by essentially employing them and subcontracting them out for various short term jobs they can put on their CV. This is pretty much what they already do, except it'd be more like a temp agency than the JobCentre.

it being community service means you're wasting applicants' time. They want a job. Having 'did x months community service' actually HINDERS their CV because employers think ""oh, bugger that bloke, he's done the Community Service, shows he couldn't find a job on his own, dunnit, shows lack of initiative and effort, let's hire the hot applicant instead, even if he can't do the job at least he'd look nice on the shop floor""",null,0,null,1424171632,null,0,false,0,coo0w8e,null,t3_2w5kgs,null,t1_coo0w8e,null,t3_2w5kgs,null,null,null,1424636070,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

&gt;

&gt;___Maid Marian and her Merry Men___ is a British children's [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom) created and written by [Tony Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robinson) and directed by David Bell. It began in 1989 on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially [musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre) [comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy) retelling of the legend of [Robin Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood), placing [Maid Marian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_Marian) in the role of leader of the [Merry Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Men), and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-[tailor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor).

&gt;The programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to *[Blackadder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder)*, not only for its historical setting and the presence of [Tony Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robinson) (as well as early, uncredited, script editing work being undertaken by [Richard Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curtis)), but also for its comic style. It is more surreal than *Blackadder*, however, and drops even more (deliberate) [anachronisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism). Many of the show's cast such as [Howard Lew Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lew_Lewis), [Forbes Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Collins), [Ramsay Gilderdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Gilderdale) and [Patsy Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Byrne) had previously appeared in various episodes of *Blackadder* alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those media.

&gt;The show was such a success that there was an adaptation produced for the stage, a cartoon strip by [Paul Cemmick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cemmick) which was serialised in the *[Daily Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph)'*s children's paper ""The Young Telegraph"" (also available as a series of collections), and the programme was repeated on BBC One in 2001. Series 1 was released on video in 1990, with three episodes each on two tapes, and all four series are available on DVD. During the summer of 2009, [Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(TV_channel\)) repeated the entire 4 series.

You could do a more separated site on a similar basis (using whatever content the rss feed gives you (presumably an excerpt)). However I think if you only post a paragraph you'd only get people commenting on that paragraph half the time, and if you only post a link your site will look a bit basic.

Ripping the full content is technically possible, but also bound to get you into legal trouble. I believe you could re-write articles about the same events and be fine, but that would be a lot more work and you'd still have problems with pictures etc.

IMO make a subreddit and start there. See if it has an audience, etc. Then build a bigger site if needed.

I find a lot of the opposition to even the idea of it in this thread is rather puerile and reactionary. The fact is that the welfare system was not built with the demographics of today in mind (or the cost of living, or the cost of healthcare, or longevity, and a whole heap of things).  So it has to evolve. God forbid we ever go back to workhouses, but benefits are probably going to have to be relinked more closely to labour in some way.

The ""Daily Mail obese benefit claimants"" are of course actually a tiny minority. But they fact that they exist - that legally people can refuse to work and demand to be supported their entire lives - well, that's highly problematic.  If the overall pendulum swings from ""grateful"" to ""entitled"", then your economy is fucked. 

Right now I see a lot of entitlement expressed in the above comments.

I spent almost a year out of work in 2010 - I applied for over 250 positions and got 5 interviews. I have a degree from one of the top universities in the country, and had three years' work experience in my field

The market was such that every position had hundreds of applicants for each role. I couldn't get the shitty jobs because I was overqualified and I couldn't get the jobs I wanted because there was always someone more experienced out there, or someone moving from job to job.

The local paper for my area is 60% advertisements for international chains that are in this area, 30% heavily biased reporting to prop up various people's affairs without any contention or exploration of differing opinions, and 10% a letters page.

Your best bet is to either start your own paper, or do a blog and do the same thing without publication costs or distribution worries.
If you wanted a discussion though, might be better to do it via Reddit. Make a news subreddit for your area, and crosslink posts with /r/united kingdom and /r/uknews.


Obviously when making articles/posts on existing sources, you don't copy and paste it, you provide the link/citation, but then discuss the things mentioned in it under the assumption your audience can use that link/citation to check what you're talking about. That way you avoid plagarism, and provoke debate, similar to how on TV news breakfast shows they have brief discussions sometimes going over the differing slants of newspaper headlines.

Heck, even if you were hella biased or unconsciously so, that'd cause a decrease in overall news bias and cause a gradual increase in opinion and debate over matters, as you'd be essentially challenging the writer of the article you are writing an article challenging.

One thing I'd advise though is choose your news/subreddit/blog's title carefully. As a teenager I ran a paper for my village, articles about thefts and stuff, but we were told to stop by a big newspaper in America that shared the same name (it was some town in Maine that shared the same name as my childhood's village).

Answer:  To dick you over, in any way possible.  

Fuck the JC - the one time I had to rely on my so-called entitlement to the dole (made redundant after... 20 or so years working full time)... they treated me like some deviant child.  You have to run their ridiculous gauntlet to their exact specifications, or you get sanctioned.  None of the things they force you to do actually help you get a job, either... they just make you feel like a low-down-rotten-scrounger-loser who needs constant supervision.  

And then they cut me off after 12 weeks because... fucking reasons or something (that was apparently the longest I was allowed to claim...).  And this was only for job-seekers, they said I didn't qualify for housing benefit or council tax relief because the other occupant of my household was working... as if that suddenly makes them legally obligated to cover my living expenses...

Well if you hire 10 people and each person can make 50 widgets a month, if you can fire two people and still run your business, you obviously didn't need to make those 100 widgets did you?

The reality is no one gets fired (or at least, very rarely) because companies already run at the bare minimum staff numbers they need in order to function (which is best business practice). When people do get fired, it's often because their job wasn't actually needed anyway, so its actually made the business a bit more efficient.

It's the same with this, Tesco ""taking on people"" to ""help"" the government is not what happened. Their stores already run on the minimum number of staff needed, so adding more people either means that your existing staff do less work (which is inefficient) or it means you start doing things that you weren't doing before (which if you wanted to do, you should hire more actual staff).

It's the same with this whole proposal, if someone is actually working and the government is paying them benefits, then the government might as well have just hired them to do it in the first place. On the other hand, if the government has them doing something that isn't really worth doing then they are just finding pointless work to fill their time, which could be better spent looking for jobs or attending government ran workshops.

1) I don't think so. This would be a separate system to normal employment, so PAYE stuff, NI etc. would not apply.

2) In terms of illness, I don't see why such a system shouldn't have sick days included, e.g you get one (?) no-questions-asked sick day per quarter, paid for by the government (remember, this is only once a week so four a year is quite generous). Any more than that amount and you'd get flagged for an appointment as some kind of other benefit may be more appropriate if you are sick all the time!

**Also...**

I got a bit excited about this, and decided to run some quick stats to see if my off the cuff figures were anywhere near accurate. Here's what I came up with:

The Basic Employment system would probably need to provide about 4 million Basic Employment ""slots"" (BES) per week. These would be available to anybody aged 16-64 who wanted them.

There are roughly 20 million people employed in the private sector by businesses that employ 10 or more people.

This means that, under the scheme, companies that employ 10 or more people would be required to provide one BES for every five employees, at a cost of £60 per slot per week (6-8 hours*), in order to meet the 4 million target. 

If we take Marks and Spencer as an example, they employ about 86,000 people. The scheme would require them to provide 17,200 BES at a cost of about £64 million per year. Last year, they had revenues of £10.3 billion. BES costs would be the equivalent of an extra 0.6% in tax — certainly a manageable amount.**

The scheme would replace job seekers allowance (and thus have the added benefit of making the horrible job centre system redundant) but not disability, single parent benefits etc. It would save the government around £4 billion a year — more than enough to cover the costs of enforcing the policy on the slippery private sector and setting up a decent system to allocate the jobs.

*The wage would need to be significantly higher than minimum wage in order to stop companies from abusing it, and to put a little pressure on companies to pay better. If it were too high, however, presumably many more people would want to take the jobs, potentially overloading the system.

**These figures are taken from the statistics for the entire company (international and domestic) but domestic business represents approximately 90% of their income and employment, so the same percentages will apply, approximately.",null,0,null,1424174111,null,0,false,0,coo1f74,null,t3_2w5kgs,null,t1_coo1f74,null,t1_coo18ed,null,null,null,1424636314,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

The people affected by this would be pretty much getting scammed out of £137.65 a week, assuming they were on as little as minimum wage.

It's hardly surprising that players Rodgers didn't want would be unhappy with him. He didn't buy Carroll, Downing or Agger and didn't think they were good enough. I personally don't blame him at all for thinking that. The former two were probably desperate to stay because they knew they would never play for as big a club again and probably shouldn't have in the first place. 

I love Agger to death for his love and passion for the club, but I've never really rated him as a defender. He's the opposite of Mignolet. Miggy does the very basic job brilliantly (saving shots) but lacks the things that can make him world class. Agger can do all the things that could make him world class, but he wasn't a good defender.

On Downing, here's a quote (note: not his quote, but a quote) from the article I linked above:

&gt;Stewart Downing called his time playing makeshift left-back for Liverpool the lowest moment of a career which is in the midst of a resurgence thanks to another positional change.

It's clear to see why Rodgers let him go. Every player in our squad has played out of their natural position at some stage under Rodgers - he likes the tactical flexibility. If Downing couldn't deal with that then he was better off playing for someone else.

I don't see anything that Rodgers has done wrong here.

The sub-nations of the UK have no more international status than one of the US states. Even less so, as their existence has no basis in a written constitution. 

Nowhere, besides my personal beliefs and my address, is there a document that says I'm 'English'. 

When Scotland had its referendum they basically invented the criteria to allow someone to vote. I had an 'English' friend who voted because she was studying in Scotland. 

We call them 'countries' because no-one told us to stop. Our state formed at a time when the notion of owing allegiance to the nation state above other allegiances was pretty much a novelty. 

Other countries have stemmed sub-nationalism (e.g. Italy) and succeeded. Others (e.g. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia) tried and failed. 

We never bothered trying. At least, we've always accepted the concept of multiple national identities, and we've carried then through to the present day.

But that's the cultural situation, not the legal one. England doesn't even have a government...

If the Tories or one of the right wing papers had made a connection between jobseekers and criminality as obvious as that, there would be an absolute shitstorm. And if you can't trust somebody not to steal something, then chances are when they find a job they'll just steal from there instead.

British Chinese here.

Generally because we're working we completely ignore it.

However on the day before you clean your house top to bottom.

On the day you do nothing which might be considered work not even cleaning.

You must wear completely new clothes (behind me is a carrier bag with jeans, top socks and underpants).

You then eat with family and your elders give you red packets with money (you can only give them to younger people and if you are married). It is preferable to go out and eat so you don't do any work.

More pagan people like my dad lights fireworks to scare away bad demons and gives offerings to photos of his ancestors (usually a oven baked chicken which you CANNOT EAT).

Manchester China town usually has a lion dance though they don't compete for the cabbage as they do in China. The next few days are spent avoiding younger Chinese people to prevent them from asking red packets from you.

Aside from the costs of managing such employees, including training them. When I worked for M&amp;S it was three weeks full time training, how does someone who is on this ""work scheme"" get trained? If they are trained on the job you'll effectively lose an employee per ""BES employee"" to monitor and train them. You also have the fact that people on the BES scheme are more likely to be the ones that are looked for by M&amp;S* than the general public, those with criminal histories, lack of experience, poorer qualifications, etc. They may not work as well as regular employees and could spread discontent - ""Why does he get £10/hour when we only get £6 an hour?"". 

It sounds like a good idea but I can't see companies supporting it unless their extra costs are covered. *M&amp;S was used as this was your example but substitute John Lewis, Tesco, etc as you choose. Then consider the extra liability these people have such as untrained and unmotivated people working in these jobs are more likely to call in sick, more likely to make mistakes (aren't trained as well, by their nature), and as such more likely to cost in other ways (sick pay, customer relations, health and safety issues).

People/institutions change their minds on things all the time, surely this is a good thing? 

I feel like it is dishonest to attack the church for being too conservative/stuck in it's ways, and then in the same breath also attack it for changing its mind on things. 



&gt; For people intimately associated with the mind of their god

I feel like you're putting words in people's mouths here. Some people believe this to be the case in some churches. Others do not. It is a very, very broad spectrum. For example

""For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him. For in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is the best knowledge""

Coutinho and Lallana would be competing with him, but in a lot of lineups one of these could be picked as well as Pjanic. That's without considering the versatility of Lallana, who can play on either wing or behind a striker at similar positions. Also, considering Lallana's injury problems and the amount of games Coutinho has played, a bit more depth here would be nice.

I'm mostly daydreaming here, but if we pulled this off I think our midfield/attack could be the following:

&gt; 99% of the time he agrees with his quantitative strategy, the 1% of the time when he disagrees with the machine he realizes in retrospect that  the machine was right 66% of the time.

So even he underperforms when he brings 'gut feeling' into the equation.  So why do you think you'll do better than Ray Dalio?

In particular the Dogs strategy is likely to be highly volatile because many of these have had/do have operational or financial issues, so 15% movement is likely to happen regularly.  That means you'll stop yourself out when the share is even cheaper and before it recovers, or you'll take profits way too soon.  Before you take this +/-15% approach, check to see the volatility of the strategy.  Also check not just the average return, but the return of each individual stock - for example if 80% of them fall 20% and 20% of them quadruple (extreme example), then you'll miss out on the vast majority of the upside from the 20%, and lock in 15% downside in the 80%.  You really need to get a more detailed understanding of the strategy performance before you deviate from it.

From my limited understanding I think Lenin shared Marx's criticisms of religion, indeed where Marx had said

&gt;The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.

Lenin said:

&gt;Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.

Which I find to be very interesting from a philosophical perspective.

What I find even more interesting - and I only just learned this having looked up those quotes - is that a professor and Priest of the CoE echoed Marx's comments in 1847, only 4 years after Marx had written them:

null,false,Godhatesfats,null,null,null,"tl;dr ""we need 37-40 points"". Well, file that under ""things we already knew.""

What's more interesting is how we're going to get them. On the 1st of Jan we drew 1-1 with Swansea at home, bringing us to 19 points. If we take 40 points to be the threshold for safety, that means we were still missing 21 points, which is equal to 7 wins. So, during the 2nd half of the season, we need to win 7 times (or 6, and 3 draws; or 5, and 6 draws, and so on until we run out of available fixtures), in order to reach 40 points.

Since that game against Swansea we've managed to pick up only 3 points with the win against Sunderland. This means we now need 6 wins from our remaining 13 games. Let's have a look at which those remaining fixtures are:

* Sat 21 Feb - Hull (A)

* Wed 4 Mar - Arsenal (H)

* Sat 7 Mar - Tottenham (H)

* Sat 14 Mar - Crystal Palace (A)

* Sat 21 Mar - Everton (H)

* Sat 4 Apr - West Brom (A)	

* Sat 11 Apr - Chelshit (H)

* Sat 18 Apr - Aston Villa (A)

* Sat 25 Apr - West Ham (H)

* Sat 2 May - Liverpool (A)

* Sat 9 May - Man City (A)	

* Sat 16 May - Newcastle United (H)	

* Sun 24 May - Leicester (A)

There are five fixtures in there that stand out as being especially tough -- Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelski, Liverpool and City. If we assume that we lose those, that gives us 8 games out of which to get 6 wins. 

Since it's difficult to imagine that happening, the only alternative is that we have to cause some upsets against the big teams. Three of those five tough games are at home, though, and we'll have a go against anyone at Loftus Road. Anyway, summa summarum, we need to cause upsets against the big teams to reach that 40-point mark to have a realistic chance at surviving.",null,0,null,1424179944,null,0,false,0,coo2z0o,null,t3_2w6q0v,null,t1_coo2z0o,null,t3_2w6q0v,null,null,null,1424637037,null,2,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,2,null

Right, so saying people can now only spend 10 hours a week looking for work is a bit daft, no?

This does only apply to people who are 18-21 and haven't been able to get a job for 6 months.

null,false,ReelBigMidget,null,null,null,"Harrow resident here, I'd recommend you take the 140 bus from Heathrow Airport to Harrow-on-the-Hill (this should take under 90 minutes and means you avoid going into and out from central London). It will cost you around £2 BUT you can no longer pay with cash on London buses so you'll need to buy an ""Oyster card"" which will cost you £5. I'd say put about £20 on the card to cover your travel for 2 days. 


We're not spoilt for hotels in Harrow but someone below mentioned the Cumberland which is probably the nicest option and literally opposite the bus stop. There are a few smaller bed-&amp;-breakfast type places around but you'd have to check online. Once you're sorted, you'll want to take the Metropolitan Line from Harrow-on-the-Hill to Wembley Park (around 10 mins normally but there will probably be some disruption due to the volume of people). This will cost about £3.


There are several pubs in Wembley and they tend to segregate on match days. There's lots of off-licences but watch out for the police who may stop you street-drinking. You can buy a beer inside the stadium but you're not allowed to take it out into the seats or in view of the pitch so watch out for that pre-game crush and half-time stampede.


I've no idea how likely you are to be able to find a ticket, legally or through touts (scalpers). It'll be expensive either way. If you can't, there will be drinking at pubs around the stadium but Wembley itself it pretty grotty. You might want to consider heading over to Tottenham and finding a pub near White Hart Lane.

1) Trying to squeeze in lessons in between full time work is a PITA. You then need to take days off for the written and practical exam. 

2) the test gets harder. My SO who passed when she was 17 can drive a ton of extra vehicles I need to pass additional tests for. Her test didn't  include a bunch of stuff mine did for instance. 

3) you have less points in your first 2 years. Even if you never drive for the first 2. It becomes harder for you to lose your license for minor traffic offences.

4) hire cars: sure you need to be 25 - many hire places also need you to hold a license for over 2, sometimes 3 years.



Sure, your job now might not require you to drive - but remember a huge percentage of people commute by car - and if you have children, want to move house, maybe take a driving holiday etc - having a license is just one of those things.

null,false,Shuhnaynay,flair5,,null,"A TL;DR summary thus far:

Archway are challenging the CPO on three bases:

1. Legality; 

2. Certainty of delivery of the scheme; and

3. Material changes to the scheme after the granting of the CPO. 

So far we've only heard some of the legality arguments. They are:

* The [Secretary of State](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02182/pickles_2182265b.jpg) incorrectly relied on the assumption of validity. 

       Essentially, council planning orders are assumed to be valid until challenged and quashed. Archway is arguing that this assumption does not apply to the stadium on the basis of old case law ^which ^I ^can't ^actually ^see ^what ^it ^says. 

* The CPO was granted on the incorrect presumption that Tottenham Hotspur will stay in Tottenham.

       Archway is arguing that, because ENIC looked to move Spurs to Stratford and haven't addressed this precondition in public statements, this ground is not satisfied and the CPO should not have been granted. (The judge seems to have taken a dim view of this, saying it's not his job to make council decisions.)

* The CPO was granted on the presumption that the development will improve sustainability in the area, but Tottenham haven't been required to actually build anything. 

* Just before lunch, Archway started to talk about whether or not the development was sufficiently financially viable to satisfy CPO conditions. But then the judge got hungry.

I'll pick this up again at the end of the day, but I've got some stuff to get on with. Hope this helped, rather than trawling through updates and Tweets. 

**AFTER LUNCH:**

No doubt fully satiated, Archway's barristers moved on to point 3: 

* The council granted the CPO for a plan which has since changed, thus they filed a ""misdirection challenge.""

       In essence, they are arguing that Spurs have since changed their planned development, whose financial viability is unknown. As such, the [Secretary of State](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4718521/Eric-Pickles-biscuit-bill-rises-by-10000.html) has not made a ruling based on the correct planned development and should have made further enquiries, which he has not. Therefore, the [Secretary of State](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1227351/thumbs/o-ERIC-PICKLES-facebook.jpg) has not approved a CPO for the actual development. (It was dropped in here that Spurs have got naming rights for the new stadium sorted, but no real detail was produced.) The judge summed up this argument as: ""the changes are something that might have caused the [Secretary of State](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01976/eric-pickles-crowl_1976481b.jpg) to come to another conclusion.""

And that finished off the representations for Archway. 

Over it turned to the Treasury Department (NOTE: although this is billed at Archway vs. Spurs, the court case is technically Archway vs. the Treasury Department for not objecting to the CPO). 

* On the issue of legality, the Treasury argued that ""There is a degree of artificiality about the complaints being made.""

      On the matter of the assumption of validity, they argued that this sort of development IS covered by the assumption.

     On the matter of Spurs not committing to Tottenham, while Spurs did look at Stratford, that hasn't come to pass and, as such, Spurs WILL stay put. Thus, Stratford not really relevant. Overall, the Treasury took issue with the perceived lack of oversight by the [Secretary of State](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02560/Eric-Pickles_2560963b.jpg), arguing that he took the requested CPO seriously. 

     The bar for determining if a CPO was not issued legally is very high and Archway have failed to meet that threshold. 

And that was that for the day! Hope this helps.

The whole service is not staffed appropriately - we're always hearing about hiring too few doctors and nurses, but the problem extends to allied professions like physio and OT and that has enormous implications for discharge times and community rehab units. Demand for investigations also far outstrips the ability to provide. I'm routinely faced with a choice of keeping an otherwise fit patient in hospital for an extra 3-4 days for test appointments, in the knowledge that if I stick them on the outpatient list, they won't be seen for 6-12 months.

Most of the time-wasters are lonely old people who fully expect that niggle to be inconsequential but ""just wanted to check"", and most GPs are thick-skinned enough to sent a patient home without a prescription or a sick line if they don't think it's necessary (or put some sort of plan in place to break the cycle.)

The way ""actively seeking work"" is tested currently is that they agree with a claimant steps the claimant will take to find work then check those.

On top of that they may impose addition requirements such as requiring someone to apply for a job they consider reasonable. At one point they were telling some claimants they were required to do workfare (unpaid work) but that seems to have stopped since Cait Reilly won her case.

So if this works similarly it won't matter that you have zero chance of getting more hours as long as you do 3 things a week to try to get more.

It is a job in a sector that the country would come to a complete stop without. The average age of workers is increasing year on year, the number of people entering it are lower than the number leaving. The industry already tried employing eastern europeans a decade ago and it was an absolute disaster so very few companies employ any at all and for those who do, they maybe have single percentage figures of foreign workers. Because of the long hours, an average working week excluding breaks being 55hrs, it doesn't appeal to many people so the numbers entering it will continue to be quite low thus maintaining wages.

Thanks to mandatory EU legislation in the form of the DCPC, quite a lot of people left the industry in September as they refused to do the DCPC and cannot work as a driver without it. Wages therefore nationally have seen an increase of around £2/hr in the last year in the lower paid parts of the country and any company who hasn't increased them is finding it very hard to find staff, effectively being forced to take on those who have just passed their HGV test and the unemployable or resort to staffing via agencies and paying through the nose. Stobarts, despite what you saw on the TV programme have a reputation as a crap employer, pay crap and they use a lot of agency drivers. At some depots almost all their drivers are agency. We've already returned to the situation where you see billboards at the side of major roads and motorways advertising for lorry drivers.

I work for an agency as I get even more money and to choose who I work for and when. The traditional January to March lull never happened.

Automation isn't really a worry, and while outsourcing is it's not outsourcing to other countries, it's outsourcing to big accountancy firms based in the UK. So I'd worry about my job personally being lost but there is still a call for auditors.

As regulation increases the calls for these jobs increases too so that has helped. It's difficult to judge how it's going, I see lots of jobs advertised but have no way of knowing how many applicants they are getting for every job. So there could be 100s of jobs with 1000s of applicants.

Wouldn't it be better if instead of money being paid and used in this system, the money instead gets repurposed to pay full time staff to do community service instead?


&gt; If you're guilty of 'getting comfortable' on the benefits system - then that's your own problem. Most people don't get comfortable, and will find work. Overpayments and fraud are a tiny, tiny percentage of the expenditure on JSA - the governments own figures back this up.

By getting comfortable, I mean just doing looking for the bare minimum in order to keep the Job Centre/Housing Benefit guys off my back. When they moved me on to do these 'classes' mixed in with people who clearly don't *want* to work *ever*, THAT's when I started to actually look for a job with full effort.

My circumstances have changed since those days since I now have a mortgage to pay, but I know that if I ever ended up in Job Seekers again whilst I was still just renting a room, I would have tried my damn hardest to find a job *before* I got pushed into doing community service.

null,false,neenoonee,null,null,null,"I'm a Director at my own Pest Control company. Pest Control is booming. With the movement of more and more people throughout the world (students, migrants, tourists etc) they're bringing in more and more hidden nasties.

Take for instance, there's a student house and one of the bedrooms have Bed Bugs. They don't just stay confined in that one room, they will happily move to wherever they believe there is an adequate food source and with there being 5 other students living in the same house, they're soon throughout the place. 

One of the students then determines that he can no longer put up with sleeping with Bed Bugs and decides for the rest of the term that he is going to go and stay in his Girlfriends house which is across campus. Another one of the students has prolific one night stands (at least once a week) and the other one has just been home over the weekend to visit his parents. In each case (as Bed Bugs are highly easy to move about) each one of them spread the infestation to other properties.

So from that one room being infested, in one week, we now have 4 different houses with infestations in the same area. And the chain just goes on and on and on and on. And it's fantastic if you have the right equipment, training and knowledge on how to eradicate them. 

There's opportunities in both Private and Public sectors, as not every local authority will offer pest control services to those living in the area they serve. The only downside to the Public sector is that when they do have a pest control team, they're doing it for profit. They're actually competition for private, independent pest controllers, using the council tax money and rates that we pay as individuals and as a business. If the local councils weren't so skint we could easily be pushed out of business by them.

No outsourcing as such, foreign born nationals can try and get jobs in my field but it's not cheap, the training is fairly intense and you'd need a good understanding on UK Laws regarding the environment and animal species.

null,false,DrBort,null,null,null,"GP here.  I'll chime in with a few personal thoughts on the matter.  You'd probably get variety of opinions around my colleagues, but most are against reintroducing prescription charges.

The main thing is that the vast majority of people who use the GP would get free scripts anyway- the elderly, children etc.  Plus there's a long (and many would say illogical) list of medical conditions which exempt many patients from charges for ALL scripts (not just those that treat the specified condition).  This is still the case in England, and I presume if they were reintroduced here, it would be on a similar model, which is more or less the same model we had here in NI until a few years ago when charges were abolished.

I'm grateful you asked for a GPs perspective because there are factors that, I'm guessing, might be less than apparent unless you're in the job.  For one example, at the moment I have no problem issuing very small supplies of high-cost drugs - I can always give them another supply in a week or two, once I know's it's effective and the patients hasn't had to abandon using the drug due to side effects. If it costs 8 quid or whatever per prescription (regardless of how many patches is on the script - whether one 1 or 100 - this is the way it worked), instead of issuing a script for, say, a week's trial of Versatis pain patches (c. £70 a month), I'll probably feel a pressure to give them 2 or 4 weeks, because of the cost to the patient.  

I really don't want patients pressurising me to give them bigger supplies of drugs they may not even use.  And neither may the taxpayer.

I really don't want patients to have to pay for drugs anyway- I want to decide on the basis of what's in the best interests of their health.

A few years ago when charges were abolished here, I thought we'd see a big increase in prescription requests for paracetamol or whatever if may be, because you can get them, like, free off the dacter!

In the short term, outsourcing would be a worry if I didn't already have a bazillion years of experience. In the medium to long term though, it wouldn't be, because pay for people in the third world is shooting up.

There are some IT jobs where outsourcing is still a Good Thing, and always will be a Good Thing. If you want 24 hour support, then the problem of time zones goes away. So provided you can efficiently manage remote workers then you might as well get your 24 hour support by having remote workers in Delhi and Auckland and Utah instead of Glasgow and Stevenage and Barnstaple.

Additional summaries are also available [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Job+Statistics#tab-data-tables).

Section 21(1) shows the following:

Jun-Aug 2014	| 681	| 1,972	| 2.9 |
Sep-Nov 2014	| 695	| 1,914	| 2.8 |

There's absolutely zero doubt that the UK is a nation state, which is an equivalent to the US, Germany etc... England, whilst certainly a *historic* nation, with an established people and culture, is not a nation-state, and doesn't exist on the same level as other sovereign nations.

Though, like anything man-made, these are all legal constructs. There isn't a one size fits all solution to this, and if people don't want to culturally associate with the nation-state, then why the hell should they?

But when people say things like 'the English government has done '...' ' then that's where the distinction matters. Some things are just flat-out wrong. It's like calling a tomato a vegetable; in your head, it might make sense, and convey the intended concept, but it doesn't make it correct.

Our household includes two adults &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; two cats 

Shops include stuff like TP, cat food, cleaning products, shampoo, toothpaste, coffee. Monthly we buy booze to the tune of 6-7 bottles of wine, usually a bottle of spirits once a month (gin or vodka), often a couple of bottles of prosecco if we have company.  Very little to no meat.

I also spend £60-70 on a decent bottle of whiskey once every few months.

Additionally, we both take our own food into work for lunch which comes out of the food budget.

I realise it's expensive. We don't have time or inclination to go to lidl which is a 25 min drive each way. Ocado is convenient, nothing is ever substituted and the slots are always on time.  We can afford it so I have no issues with good food and drink (and cheese).

You admit homeless are dangerous, implying having one near your children is a bad thing. You do not say why having dangerous people in front of your shop is any less of a problem then having dangerous people near your children.

*you* are the one with a piss poor argument

Spikes are *not* inhumane because they see them and don't sit on them

Are burglar alarms, barbed wire and people with cricket bats to fight off burglars inhumane too?

If the homeless didn't cause problems by sleeping there (You already said they cause problems, by admitting you don't want them near your kids) the spikes wouldn't be there.

It isn't selfridges job to make sure the homeless are housed any more than it's your job to do it. Selfridge's have every right in the world to tell them to fuck off, just as you do

When Putin formed his first cabinet as Prime Minister in 1999, Abramovich interviewed each of the candidates for cabinet positions before they were approved. Subsequently Abramovich would remain one of Putin's closest confidants. In 2007 Putin consulted in meetings with Abramovich on the question of who should be his successor as president - Medvedev was personally recommended by Abramovich.

Chris Hutchins, a biographer of Putin, describes the relationship between the Russian president and Abramovich as like that between a father and a favorite son. Abramovich himself says that when he addresses Putin he uses the Russian language's formal ""Вы"" (like Spanish ""usted"", German ""Sie"" or French ""vous""), as opposed to the informal ""ты"" (Spanish ""tú"", German ""Du"" or French ""tu"").

I am now aware a documentary came out in 2009 called When boris met dave about the bullingdon club. But back then it was only between labour, libs and conservatives so no matter what the same puppeteer would be in power. Seen alot of green party members getting angry with me. I did not mean the green party was run by bankers i was talking about the mainstream parties. The only reason the greens are getting more members and more attention is because the conservatives and labour are wanting to put more parties in the lime light to dilate the attention from ukip. Cameron is still chicken shit though for a debate... So I apologise if I've offended you with my language hopefully I'll do more videos in the future more intelligently than this one was done. ""

&gt;&gt; If I had a 24 hour camera system and didn't sleep at my house? Fine alright then. I certainly wouldn't install metal spikes. I'd talk to them and try and get them to a shelter.

I guess I'm saying the burden of proof is on you here. Seems to me that the default position is something like, ""Owners of private property can do what they like with it, unless there is a compelling government interest to prevent them from doing that"". That means that both you and Selfridges are free to prevent homeless people sleeping outside your property, by any (legal) means you want. It would be weird to have to make the same argument for every kind of private property a homeless person could choose to sleep in front of. In fact, that seems like the position *you* were taking just a few comments ago - that shops and houses were basically the same, except there was a compelling reason to make a distinction for shops because they had 24 hour CCTV.

But if you want an argument that there *is* an equivalence, consider that the main reasons most people don't want a homeless person living on their property it would be something like fear of damage to the property, fear of harm to the surrounding area (e.g. if homeless people generate a lot of litter), fear of psychological harm (for example if the homeless person threatened or harrassed you) and finally fear of physical harm. Of course, most homeless people are just ordinary guys who are down on their luck, but one or two are homeless because of serious psychological reasons (they should really be in hospital, but have slipped through the cracks somehow) and you don't get to pick which homeless person moves in. So that same list also applies to Selfridges; damage or theft from the store would be expensive, harm to the surrounding environment will cause a lot more work for staff, physchological harm will distress potential customers and there's a good chance they would be liable for any physical harm suffered by a passer-by.

But my arguing *for* equivalence is - as I say - a bit of a red herring. It would be silly to argue on a case-by-case basis, and makes a lot more sense to 'argue by exception'; why should shops be treated differently to other private property?",null,0,null,1424190215,null,0,false,0,coo7o49,null,t3_2w6xu5,null,t1_coo7o49,null,t1_coo7845,null,null,null,1424639299,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

It might be OK for Arsenal to just kind of exist in this vacuum of not winning anything except for appearing in the Champions League, but it's not enough for Liverpool. **Winning trophies** should always be top priority. For us to finish third or fourth isn't crazy but it does rely a certain amount on other teams doing some of the work for us. I, for one, cannot be proud of that. I would be pleased, don't get me wrong, but I'd rather win some trophies and have to go through the extra qualifying rounds to the Champions League, and have a chance of failing them, than entertain the notion that getting at least fourth place in a league we have won 19 times is some spectacular, champagne popping end-all-be-all.

null,false,gamerme,aberdeen,,null,"One of Scotland’s top referees is making headlines again following his horror show in yesterday’s Premiership tie between Aberdeen and Hamilton.

Whistler Willie Collum is regarded as one of the most respected in the country, has been refereeing at the top level in Scotland for over a decade and regularly takes charge of major European matches, however, his performances have been questioned a number of times in recent months – none more so than Sunday’s game at New Douglas Park.

Albeit not helped by his assistants, Collum failed to award Aberdeen a goal when Adam Rooney’s effort struck the underside of the bar before bouncing a foot over the line, he also awarded an Accies free kick when Rooney was wrestled to the ground by Hamilton defender Jesus Garcia Tena.

The referee and linesman failed to spot that the ball had crossed the line
Collum and his linesman failed to spot that the ball had crossed the line
In an effort to show it was not just Rooney he was targetting, Collum also disallowed a perfectly good David Goodwillie goal and a debatable goal from Sunday’s man-of-the-match, Andrew Considine.

David Goodwillie had this goal chopped off for offside despite Eamonn Brophy playing the striker a number of yards onside
David Goodwillie had this goal chopped off for offside despite Eamonn Brophy playing the striker a number of yards onside
His performance comes a number of weeks after he was dropped by the SPFL for two rounds of matches, just last month.

Yet the issue a number of people find the most alarming is that fact that Collum still represtents Scotland on the European and international stage on a regular basis – this season alone he has taken charge of European giants Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus.

**Willie Collum this season**

31 games

101 yellow cards

12 red cards

*European games*

CSKA Moscow 0-1 Bayern Munich

Barcelona 3-1 Ajax

Juventus 0-0 Atl Madrid

*International matches*

Montenegro 1-1 Sweden

Romania 1-1 Hungary

For a long time now questions have been asked of referees across Scotland but Collum attracts more stick than most and, although assistants David McGeachie and Dougie Potter failed to help him at the weekend, Collum’s New Douglas Park performance will only add to the criticism regularly sent his way.

After the match Dons boss Derek McInnes was willing to forgive Collum, but he admitted that could have been different had his team not still won the match: “Thankfully the decisions haven’t impacted on the result, otherwise we might be making a bit more of it.

“I’ve not seen Considine’s header again but I have seen the other two. Rooney’s should stand, it’s a good bit over the line. When you see how far it was over the line, we should be getting that right.”

But criticism of Collum comes from further than just the Dons dugout – social media was awash with Collum bashing on Sunday night, while there is even long standing Facebook page simply titled ‘Sack Willie Collum’ and a Twitter account @WillieCollum that refers to itself as ‘Willie watcher’ and does nothing other than poke fun at the 36-year-old.


**What next for Collum?**

While Collum is coming in for a lot of stick just now, he had previously done a lot of good work in his referee gear (honestly!).

Collum first took charge of a Scottish league match in 2004 and worked his way up the leagues, first refereeing in the top flight in April 2006 and then taking charge of his first Champions League match in 2010, two years later his performances earned him a place at the FIFA Elite Referee level – taking place on the 24-strong list of the world’s leading referees.

Has his rise to the top got the better of him? Has he become complacent? Was he simply never that good a referee?

Whatever the case, the SPFL need to decide what to do with the whistler. Dropping him down the leagues seems disrespectful to teams in the Championship, League One and League Two, dropping him from Scottish football entirely seems a tad extreme.

However the SPFL do decide to deal with the situation in the short term, following the example set by the game down south and installing goal line technology seems like a step the SPFL must take in the long term.

The problem of course stems from the cost of introducing technology but, given the stick that Collum has taken over the past 24 hours, I reckon he may well be willing to foot the bill himself!",null,0,null,1424191232,null,0,false,0,coo8915,null,t3_2w7fqn,null,t1_coo8915,null,t3_2w7fqn,null,null,null,1424639570,null,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

Guy Standing says that any person in receipt of benefits who accepts these low paying jobs (which has an effective tax rate of 80% - compared to the effective tax rate of about 6% for the very wealthy) would fail any economics class.

Yeah. I misread your question in the previous post.

So? It's *his* act. He's been doing the same kind of stuff onstage for quite a while now. I don't know why you'd go along to his show expecting otherwise. We're coming back to you feeling he's somehow obligated to talk about what you want to hear him talking about.

I did something a bit similar myself on my 250, going up to Edinburgh first, then down to Cardiff, then back home to Sheffield. My favourite roads are:

A68 from Musselburgh to Hexham

Any  B road in the Yorkshire Dales (fill up if you're traveling in the evening though, I had to make it to Kendal on fumes in the past)

Snake Pass

Cat and Fiddle

A470 (between Trawsfyndd and Dolgellau is boring as though)

A487

Anything in the Brecon Beacons

Holderness Coast is nice too

I'm confused, how is it more time? Unless you work for less than 30 hours a week, they'll have *more time* to look for a job than someone in work.

&gt; Insinuating I'm a lousy worker is pointless and childish

Where have I done this? 

&gt; I have a well paying job

Then I have absolutely no idea why you think any of my comments about 18-21 year olds who've been out of work and education for over 6 months apply to you.

&gt; Even if doing work for free guaranteed you an excellent job, that wouldn't change the principle of it.

Wait, so you think that it's preferable to do something *less effective* for getting a job? If this is a quicker way into work for people then you end up with the situation where

1. People are out of work for less time
2. JSA paid to fewer people
3. More money on *both* sides
4. Something productive done in the meantime

&gt; I don't believe in forcing people to work for free regardless of the outcome.

It's not free though, is it? Nor is it forced. If you're 18-21, you've been out of work for 6 months and can't get an apprenticeship, then they'll pay you £57/week if you follow their process which gets you into work quicker (it's claimed) than if you're left to your own devices.",null,0,null,1424193013,null,0,false,0,coo99mt,null,t3_2w5kgs,null,t1_coo99mt,null,t1_coo8le3,null,null,null,1424640045,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

**What the fuck happened to the New Dalek Paradigm?**
They introduced a new set of Daleks, then proceeded to not use them, at all, ever. Some have appeared in the background of scenes, but 99% of Daleks are Bronze originals. What was the point of this New Paradigm if they proceeded to use genetically impure Daleks and old, crappy Dalek armour?

**Where did he get the Regenerative Energy from?** (Spoilers for Series 7 Finale)
In *Angels Take Manhattan* River Song breaks her hand, and the Eleventh Doctor sacrifices a portion of his regenerative energy to heal it. If he was on his last regeneration, where did he get this energy from, exactly? How could he use a portion if he had none left at all, as shown in Time of the Doctor?

**Is 'The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy' Canon?**
During The Christmas Invasion, The Doctor makes reference to Arthur Dent. And on several other occasions refereces alien creatures (Vogons, Hooloovoo); characters (Oolon Coluphid, Zaphod Beeblebrox) &amp; places (Betelgeuse, Earth) from the series. A copy of the HitchHiker's Guide is visible within The Library. Not to mention, Douglas Adams was a writer for Doctor Who in its early years (which is how many of these references slipped in). So, how real is the HitchHiker's Guide?

**What is Susan Foreman doing?**
The doctor's granddaughter, she was a time lord proper. She was alive the last time we saw her, during the Human-Dalek war.

Modern day lion dancing hangs the cabbage low and has one cabbage per lion or just one cabbage and one lion. Or they do it on the ground or with wide platforms.

In the past the cabbage was hung high up (think lamp post high) and the lion dancers had to negotiate narrow platforms sometimes even just poles or even a single vertical pole to get to the cabbage to demonstrate their skill and ability. They would hang it in such a way you had to stand on the other guy's shoulders to grab it on the last platform.

The thing is villages would sometimes compete against each other and bring along their own lion so it would approach via an path from a different direction. grabbing it = prestige and money. So they would take big risks on the ascent to the cabbage. You see remnants of this in the dance with two lions where they posture in front of each other and pretend to fight and compete.

Imagine this:

But with another lion team coming from the other end and a cabbage hung really high between them and the platforms higher up.

How is an 8-12 week wait ever acceptable? If I arrived 8-12 weeks late for a doctor's appointment would they consider that acceptable? 

&gt;As to the phone system -- that is just poorly designed, and not part of any NHS reform, in the overtly political manner that you implied

I didn't mean to imply politics. Just incompetence. Maybe you are right and it has always been this bad. Now that you mention it, I remember the first physio appointment I ever had. It involved long waits and a half hour consultation, just to tell me to turn my neck to the side. Given the questions asked, the entire process could have been automated into a multiple choice test. 

My point is, aside from one person to write the multiple choice test, all my experience of physio could have been replaced for pennies, and could have been available within seconds online. But instead they have an absurdly expensive system that tsakes weeks. That is what I mean by incompetence.

The conspiracy theorist in me still suspects they went after Moyes during that strange ""decision window"" on Sam at the end of last season, and he turned us down, hence sticking with Sam.

edit: I also think this is a dangerous game.  If they look for a replacement a little too hard, we have to remember Sam is under no obligation to stick around even if offered a new contract.  He will surely have offers from elsewhere from desperate teams.

- Login to Sharepoint to see if I've got any actions on for my shift (i.e this student requires this item, we've left this item for you in the post room) and make sure I record it down so I remember to actually do it.
- Go to post room and do a radio login to tell the people at Frenchay (the gatehouse) that I was 'on duty'
- I would then sort out the post to the various flats and get rid of any junk mail
- Next I would head over to Glenside, over there in the accommodation office I would check for any letters that needed to be personally delivered, usually warnings or invitations to meetings regarding anti-social behaviour/drugs. I would also have to pick up parcel notices to give to students.
- Head back over to the Hollies, and deliver the post. While delivering the post I would have to do a few security checks. One to check the magnets on all the doors (including the bike sheds) were working OK, and another would be to check the fire doors were locked. And those 'red tags' you see on the fire alarm points were on. Oh and lastly there was nothing like vomit/rubbish in any of the hallways.

That was what I did every time on shift. If I had nothing else to do, then I would just be sat in my bedroom 'working' and wait for a phone call on the mobile phone we are provided, or a phone call to my landline (Yes we could use these landlines to phone home when we weren't working. Some wardens use to unplug the landlines so students could only phone them through the mobile, those landlines were LOUD! - If I didn't get a phone call, then there was not much else to do.

The next day (or late night if you were doing an all nighter, or didn't want to get up early to put the report in) we would have to submit a Sharepoint entry to say what we did on shift and if any thing happened, most of the time there was nothing.

For those unfamiliar with the legal system of England and Wales, the case currently being heard at the High Court about the Spurs stadium is called a judicial review. This is a process where at its simplest the applicant (the person challenging the decision) says that 'a public body or government minister has made the wrong decision because...'

You cannot go and make up your own reasons why the decision maker is wrong. Your agument usually fits under one or more of three headings namely (simplified):

1. the decision is illegal (i.e. the decision maker cannot make that decision because the law says he can't)

2. the decision is 'irrational' (i.e. the decision maker made that decision up in a completely illogical way no reasonable person would have made that decision.')

3. the decision making process is flawed

This morning the applicant set out his case and it was:

A. I am challenging the decision of the SofS Planning to grant Haringey Permission to issue a Compulsory Purchase Order Notice to Archway Sheet Metal Works. 

(So the Decision Maker was the SofS)

B. I believe that the SofS was wrong to assume that that Planning permission granted by Haringey was valid.

(This looks like a challenge under illegality - i.e. the law doesn't permit the SofS to make the decision he made AND a challenge of the process - the way he made the decision was flawed.

For the first point Archway say x, y, z caselaw says that an assumption by the SofS that the planning decision was valid is illegal. For the second point Archway say the initial planning application to Haringey cannot be valid as the details of the final scheme remain unknown - hence mentioning potential move to stratford, financial viability of the scheme, final size of the stadium.)

Opinion.

To me this looks like a legal Hail Mary. If Haringey followed the correct procedure in granting planning and issuing the intial CPO notice then the SofS must assume that the process that preceded his/her decision is valid. The court will be very much aware that if they agree with the applicant on this point they will be subverting the planning process that encourages applicants like Archway to challenge the local authority rather than the SofS and that would be a policy nightmare. Ministers must assume that the decisions of Local Authorities are valid unless those decisions have been successfully challenged in court - that is a fundamental piece of the planning system.

In fact the judge said as much when he asked counsel for Archway whether he *seriously* wanted him to look behind the decision of the council. 

I think, if the court finds that way on the SofS validity point then there is very little chance that the Court will examine the second point as it only comes into play if the SofS can look behind the decision of the Local Authority.

So what you're basically saying is you have **never** experienced a tough job market where you can't just walk into a minimum wage job, or any job for that matter. It's difficult to take you seriously when lack any understanding or experience of the issue at hand here.

People with the right attitude, work ethic etc. are overlooked every single day simply because hiring managers only have so much time to go through the 50+ applications they get for each position. Not to mention candidates are frequently turned down for being overqualified, even when there are a lack of skilled jobs available, effectively leaving them in limbo.

My girlfriend has worked her arse off since she was 16, working towards the masters degree that she got last year, whilst volunteering in various charitable organisations including a special needs school, in addition to running her own craft business on the side. She is more qualified than around 80-90% of the population but she can't even get a job in a supermarket; can't even get an interview for one.

Myself, I was unemployed for 11 months up until I started my current job in July on the back of my Mechanical Engineering degree. So that is a degree in one of the safest fields there is, two years of hands on manufacturing experience and a year running the finances of a small business whilst I was in college, all in an effort to make me more employable. I had 19 interviews in those 11 months, not one was for any of the minimum wage roles I applied for. When I got my job I was told I was lucky that it only took 19 interviews, and that I effectively jumped the queue.

The job market is completely fucked and being on the receiving end of these back to work measures is a hard lesson that you have not had to endure, otherwise you wouldn't be sprouting all of this bullshit.

Take a look round your city. There will be no public seating under shelter, natural or un-natural. All covered external steps will be guarded by a metal portcullis-type railing that will be applied after closing. All public seating will have suitably placed armrests so that no one can stretch out fully and lie down on them. All these are against the homeless. The  main function of Police Community Support Officers appears to be to harass the homeless under the guise of helping them.

Also, measures to prevent someone from sitting down are everywhere built in to the design of buildings, wall and features that would otherwise provide a handy and harmless free sitting-area. We can't have that now that public seating has been privatized: it's now called ""[Starbucks¦Costa¦Nero]"". 

What is so terrible about just letting people sit down for free?

Where has the public seating gone in the centre of our cities?

Yes, there is some in the main squares in tourist areas. But even there it tends to be backless, so that no one will stay seated for too long. But outside of those areas, there has been a campaign of removing seating over the decades. 

If you compare affluent newly-built Salford Quays Media City in Greater Manchester with the busy commercial centre of Manchester you find an abundance of public seating in the former, and a dearth of it in the latters. Why is that? People need to sit down from time to time. It's nice. You can relax and enjoy life.

Boyle said that British TV executives ‘are generally scared of content,’ adding: ‘Their main motive is to avoid controversy. They don't take any risks. One of their priorities is not to take risks. I think the word “risky” is misleading though, I just want them to do something interesting. Look at the ITV schedules, it's like a cruise ship’s entertainment.’

Boyle argued that television had gone backwards in terms of intelligent content. ‘When we started on Mock The Week we were allowed to cover the Gulf War,’ he said. ‘Last time I watched the first item was the Ryder Cup – and it had been rained off.’

‘I don't think I'd ever get anything on there. They don't want anything with any interest or edge on it. It's creatively dead.’

And he again defended his joke about Katie Price’s disabled son Harvey which aired on Tramadol Nights, saying it should be heard in the context of other jokes that led up to it, mocking her media circus. ‘It's right there on  the far line, but it's not unacceptable,’ he said.

He also thought his background made him more of a target. ‘If you are white and Oxbridge educated you are judged to be playing around with content or form. But I never get any credit for this.’

So when you go to see a stand-up's live show and they've said *""I think the word “risky” is misleading though, I just want them to do something interesting.""* then you'd expect something different from their output on TV, wouldn't you?

His free kick taking ability is good, a little overhyped though in my opinion. I'd say hes a good corner taker as well. He is excellent at passing in general, whether is be long passes or short quick simple passes. He often picks the ball up and drives into space before playing passes which seem to completely open up the opposing defence.

His long shooting is decent, he has a bit of pace, works hard for the team and seems to be a leader on the field. If I had to compare him to a player, I'd say it would be Andres Iniesta, albeit a worse version. His technical attributes such as his first touch, vision, positioning, and composing are fantastic.

Negatives about him- He's not a 'CAM' as some people on here seem to think, hes not going to score many, his defensive work leaves much to be desired and he would cost a lot due to being 24 years old and having 4 years left on his contract.

You failed to see the point I was making.

IRA =/= ISIS, just like ISIS =/= MI5/CIA.

ISIS would argue that *they* are a government agency, I'd have you know, remember that they are representatives of the so called 'Islamic State'.

&gt; Ideas mean nothing, judge people by their actions.

Ideas are everything - ideas are the only reason we live a life filled with every possession you own, but this isn't really relative to our conversation. I do judge people by their actions, indeed - but I also see the motivations for those actions and try my best to *understand* their motivations and the reasons they carried out an action. When you do this, you see that the IRA were much *much* **much** more justified than ISIS. ISIS has zero justification whatsoever, the IRA grew out of a genuine political issue in which the historical mistreatment of Irishmen and women became too much to just sit back and do nothing.

&gt; Killing people is bad, ok?

Indeed, killing people is bad. ISIS kill without caring, IRA placed a lot of effort into minimising civilian deaths - but in a war, death is going to happen, and both sides are going to cause civilian death.

He does most things. He’s ready. He has 13 goals and five assists, above any 18-year-old this League has seen. He also dominates games at an international level for his own age.”

Although Robinson describes Alli as a “fantastic person, a diamond”, it has not all been plain sailing.

The 34-year-old  admits: “Have I had to get him in the office and shout at him? Yeah. Because he needs to learn sometimes, whether it be recovery, sleep patterns, schooling, homework.”

Clearly, Mauricio Pochettino will not have to worry about Alli’s homework but he has already stressed the need for his new player “to stay calm and play for his team like before”.

Robinson says that is not a concern and revealed the Spurs boss will visit MK Dons shortly.

“He wants to know what makes Dele tick and what he needs to do,” says Robinson. “He has seen him play and Tottenham are speaking to us on a constant basis regarding his development. Alli will not lose his head now that he is a Tottenham player. No chance.”

No. Pissed off that the story they've been told about working hard to get ahead doesn't seem to be quite working out like that? Oh yes.
 - It is far too late to do anything genuine about this. We need a strong economy with plenty of spending, both public and private, for that to happen, and frankly that takes more than a couple of months to engineer.

I worry about the decline in professional journalism. Critics may cheer what they see as the establishment falling but there needs to be a place for long-form, investigative, journalism and that is often overlooked in 'new media' where the focus is on clickbait headlines and driving traffic. There simply is no money in paying a reporter for a year or more to follow a story nor to pay for legion of lawyers needed in some cases.

Apparently in Afghanistan US solders were jealous of the fact that while they sat shivering in their tanks, British soldiers were having hot tea. But as standard when making a brew, we were more than happy to share with them.

Edit: while researching this fact I found some other cool tea related military facts: 

- During World War II, Britain shipped, by weight, more tea to her troops than anything save bullets.

- In 1942 the Luftwaffe decided that, deprived of tea, the British Empire would pretty much grind to a halt. They therefore decided to bomb Mincing Lane - center of all British and Imperial tea trading - flat. It worked too. The tea industry was sent into chaos and tea was rationed to two ounces a week - which is very very little. From a morale point of view it was one of the most successful bombing strategies of the war.

- In response to shortage fears, in 1942 the British decided to buy the tea. As in all of it. In the world. That's right: in 1942, to fuel her soldiers, sailors, and airmen, Britannia bought the entire world crop of tea - and it was as vital to her armies as bullets and tanks.

- On D-Day, the British troops started to make tea on Sword Beach almost as soon as they landed, even though they were still under fire. Later, after the beaches were taken and troops started to move inland, the Americans got upset over reports that the British stopped advancing to make tea,

I'm not sure what the rules for assistance are now but at the time I was eligible for a £1000 soft loan meaning if the business folded I wouldn't have to pay it back. We paid the loan back at about £30 per month with about 10% interest, not a bad deal really. On top of that myself and a partner each put £1000 in for a total of £3000. 

I also received £60 per week for about six weeks to cover living expenses. 


The business is still going after four years, although it's a tough slog. For all the talk of the recovering economy to me it seems like things are worse than they were two years ago. I see a lot of business older than mine shutting regularly. That being said things have been pretty good since the start of the year in an otherwise very quiet time. 

As far as assistance from the job centre there was very little other than an appointment with the third party who brokered the loan. This may have changed since the scheme has been rolled out properly.

null,false,bahamut19,null,null,null,"I think a lot of it is down to our poor start, the subsequent morale death spiral and our lack of defensive options either though poor performances or injury.

&gt;3) Our Wide play (or lack of it) - Coleman and Baines have not been able to do nearly as much attacking play as last season and shown by the goals and assists compared from last season. 

I think this is a symptom rather than a cause - our defence needed tightening up. Don't forget when we played (Either Wolfsburg or Lille I can't remember) the pundits were saying Baines had 9 assists so far this year. 

I guess it's easy to say in hindsight, but Distin was always a time bomb, Alcaraz was always a backup, Jagielka came off the back of a bad world cup, Hibbert (much as I love him) isn't good enough at this level anymore, and while Stones has always been good he promptly got injured.

Also, while Baines is still one of our better performers, he has not been good at set pieces since his injury last year. Baines very rarely scores from open play, but he hasn't been getting anything from free kicks or corners anymore either, which might explain some of the stats. 


&gt;Big key players where missing this season for long periods but through all of these players injuries and a stat from last season I want to look at OSMAN I think his ability to play the ball, knowledge of the game and the way he reads it is amazing and last season he played in every game in the PL whether it be as a sub or as a starter


I'm often sceptical of Osman as a starter, but he's one of the best subs in the squad IMO. He follows instructions very well, and he often manages to affect the game coming off the bench. We've effectively lost Piennar as well, which is massive because he's another player who can help dominate when he's on form.

Since last season we essentially have the same team but with Besic, Kone and Atsu in place of Pienaar, Deulofeu and Osman. With more fixtures I'm not sure that was ever really viable.

They do *not* work for you, they will *not* search the whole market, you *will* pay through the nose for it!  They typically work on commission - that means they have an incentive to sell you the mortgage which makes *them* the most money.

Ok! That said...

- Walk into any bank / building society on the high street - doesn't have to be your own.  They will only advise you about their *own* products.  They won't search the whole market.  However, they will spend 30-60 minutes with you going through your finances and telling you what they think you can afford to repay.  They'll also tell you about Government schemes which may help.
- Do this with a few building societies.  You'll get a good view of the market.  They'll load you up with leaflets - read them all.  Oh, incidentally, you don't normally need to make an appointment.
- Mortgage brokers - unless you need something *really* specialised - can't do much more than search sites like http://moneysupermarket.com/ 
- Once you have a good idea of what you can afford, start searching the Web, ringing building societies, until you find the mortgage which works for you.
- READ ALL THE SMALL PRINT! All of it. Yes, it is boring and confusing. Yes, it is important.
- If you find searching and reading too hard, pay someone to do it for you.  That's what a mortgage broker is for.  You will have to pay for this service - but better to have someone working for you than working for a hefty commission.  Even so - read everything thoroughly before signing it.

There are whole books and websites written about buying the right house and budgeting correctly. Spend a few weeks reading them.

Of course I can see the difference between those two. My point is that HSBC were always going to be unlikely to advertise in a paper which is exposing their misdeeds. This has always been the case. Papers lost contracts like this all the time. It's not new. 

However as Oborne has pointed out it used to be the case that the editorial side and the advertising side had a firewall between them so that there would not be influence between the two. His compliant is that this wall has broken down. 

Essentially my point is that the reasonability not to be influenced by advertisers lies with the newspapers and not the advertisers. This is a failure of the newspaper to value their independence.

That is harsh. You have no idea how these people treat homeless people. I would sign such a petition and sometimes donate to charities that look after the homeless. 

The government needs to act and I am allowed to complain. 

Look do you believe unemployed/sick people need help? if the government fails to help them [the sick and unemployed] does that mean I am not allowed to speak ill of my government unless I personally pay out benefits? I didn't think so and the same applies here. 

We do not know how the people treat the homeless, we do not know how those homeless people became homeless and I do not have to open a homeless shelter just so I can point out how ridiculous it is that in the year 2015, and in one of the richest countries in the world, we have a bad homeless problem.
