null,false,darksurfer,null,null,null,"Just one thing. The 2008 ""credit crunch"" / financial crisis in the UK *wasn't* caused by a global financial crisis. Our financial crisis was caused by property prices not continuing to grow indefinitely because even at 0.5% interest people couldn't afford to actually pay any higher prices. 

This raised the ugly spectre that if property prices aren't going up, they might even go down. The combination of prices not going up and the possibility (then actuality) that they go down resulted in the devaluation of the ""mortgage backed financial assets of the banks"". 

Since banks only want to lend money for house purchases when they are guaranteed of recovering their money if the mortgagee can't pay (ie they want growing equity in their housing stock) they stopped (or severely curtailed) lending money for house purchases. Since mortgages are how we print new money for our economy, vastly reduced mortgage lending meant the money supply for the economy was effectively turned off. (The *private* banks were ""printing"" new digital money at the rate of about 10% a year during the term of the labour government).

No new money (fake economic growth) = financial crisis

What did Labour do during this time? Nothing, they ""let the good times roll"". 

It should be obvious to anyone (that you'd want running an economy) that house prices couldn't go up forever, you can't keep lowering interest rates, you shouldn't let private banks print new money in *vast quantities* to create an asset bubble because at some point it's going to come to a sticky end.

Apart from that McCartney murder aye? Right? Apart from the 10 or 12 drug dealers he murdered. I'm sure some of them had kids too. Did you go around to big Jock's and tell him he was what wrong with Ulster too? Did you fuck. 

Peace and reconciliation my hole. 

I worked in mediation for years. Your ""won't someone think of the children"" approach should be aimed at him and his community for the deaths and innocent children's lives they've damaged, or some basic acknowledgment at all of the damage men like him created for our society. 

I'm what's wrong with Ulster? YOU are what's wrong with Ulster, you and all the other sycophantic cunts who like to glorify, glamorize and mourn these shitbags, whichever side they happen to be on. The lot of you make me sick with your inverted morality.

A supposed peacemaker would not be gunned down in the street. 

As for the kids. Do you know many men, women or children who had parents who were murdered in the Troubles? I suspect probably not. Either because their parents were part of paramilitary organisations and were killers themselves, or because those paramilitary organisations killed their parents? I know several. For those whose parents were in any organisation, there's not much love there for them from what I've seen. They almost all exclusively have the sense to the see the abhorrence of their parents actions, and they're better, wiser, more-rounded people for it. Those who glorified their parents, most of them spent a couple of times in jail in misguided pursuit of emulation, before eventually wising up and regretting their actions. I'm not saying not to have sympathy for children damaged by their parents lives, I'm saying that doesn't disqualify the man from criticism and I'm frankly amazed that's what you've taken from anything I said.

As for the high ground, yeah, I have the high ground above murderers and their lying revisionists. Every fucking time. Until the end of time. Don't like it? Well I'll leave you to guess what you can do with it. In the meantime, I'll be celebrating from the fucking rooftops.

None of us actually want a state of violence, that's why you and I don't go out and murder people, because we're not fucking insane.

*""Critics have concentrated their fire on the sale price. Once floated, the stock price went to 450p, rising further to 618p in January 2014. The critics argued that this was conclusive proof of âundervaluationâ of the stock; that the market verdict was a better judge of the underlying value of the company than the Government and its advisers; and that failure to foresee that had âcostâ the taxpayer large sums. Such criticism is, of course, with the wisdom of hindsight â and even hindsight does not offer omniscience.

null,false,codeduck,null,null,null,"Hi.

I'm a software dev with 15 years experience in the industry.  I did a honours degree in CS.

&gt; I would like to study CompSci since it leads into the development area quite nicely according to my dad who is also a software developer.

A CS degree teaches you a lot of the theory behind computing - not necessarily anything that is immediately applicable to Software Development.  That said, a course that covers algorithms, functional programming and parallel processing will give you a significant leg up on the average developer.  Many devs do not understand concurrency, and many devs also have no exposure whatsoever to FP.

A CS degree will get you interviews, but speaking for myself I will more likely hire someone with a demonstrated track record over a fresh graduate. Software dev is full of people with skills on paper but no ability to deliver when required to.  Your problem is going to be getting the first job - you are going to have to be a good talker and a good performer and you're going to have to convince someone that you're worth their time.

On the other hand, your career will be limited without a degree.  There are ways to do your degree later (e.g. OpenUniversity) but they require a lot of effort and focus on top of an already busy work day.

Edit to add - skip VB.NET and rather look into Javascript and something like Python, Ruby or Golang.

The political landscape has undergone unprecedented change over the last 5 years. The Greens and SNP featuring in the televised debates alone was a massive step away from the two party system we have. Do you think that was achieved by people refusing to participate? Or was it the result of 5 years of slog by people who realise the only way to achieve change is to work within the framework they have and change it from within. You do a disservice to all those people when you claim not voting is what will achieve FPTP.

It is a new and very dangerous superficial version of activism.

Next you'll be telling me my spelling and grammar must be perfect or my point is invalid. Ridiculous statement.

&gt;I love how you are for some reason outraged that elected representatives hold their constituents in the highest regard as if it's a bad thing.

Haha, that's an interesting way to put it! Let me ask you this: If the English started voting en-masse for an ""ENP"" party, who's principle goal was English independence from the union and who explicitly state that they will look after England's interests above that of the UK as a whole, would you view that simply as ""elected representatives holding their constituents in the highest regard""?

&gt;If Scotland does have such a terrible deficit like you insist that it does then it's pretty evident that governance over the past few decades under the UK Government has been completely ineffective for Scotland and that is something that will need rectified.
The fact that Scotland has abundant resources, a solid tax base and plenty of skilled workers yet is still doing such a degree worse than England isn't really a ringing endorsement for the union and the UK Government spending plans that quite clearly aren't working for it.

You're a typical nationalist: You have irrational pride in your party and country. This is demonstrated by the fact that you have no idea if I'm right about Scotland's deficit - you don't even care to check - but if I am right *it must be because rUK is holding Scotland back*.

For the record, I am right. Scotland's deficit is currently over 8% of GDP and rising, higher than any other advanced economy in the world right now except Greece: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dba27fa0-c7ea-11e4-9226-00144feab7de.html#axzz3ZLNPXUnm

The UK government aren't forcing the Scottish government to spend Â£1200/head more than rUK average, the SNP are doing it by choice, and the only reason they can afford this is because the Barnett formula is very generous to Scotland. Free prescriptions and free tuition fees in Scotland cost money, unsurprisingly.

Hence me saying I can't wait for the financial independence the SNP say they want, in theory it may finally force Scotland to live within it's means! Though in reality I'm sure the canny SNP will figure out some way of fucking rUK over and somehow getting more money in the process...

null,false,NaePish,null,null,null,"Hi Horace, 

I think I can understand why you're passionately against the notion of not voting in our fptp system. Your perspective is not unpopular and indeed it isn't 'wrong', but neither is your debating opponent's up above. 

It comes down to what matters most to the individual. In your case you seem to value honouring the commitments made by your ancestors to grant you the opportunity to vote, and the Democratic power voting gives you to add your weight to gradual positive (hopefully) change in the UK. 

Your opponent believes that it is better to reject the current system than encourage it. Every vote In a fptp system is not just a vote for a party but it's a vote for the continuation of a system that some believe is too undemocratic to be worthwhile. 

If you are content in fptp and believe the way to push for change is to continue supporting labour or tories tactically, at the expense of any alternative political views being given power, then voting is an excellent idea. I don't say that sarcastically, it's just one viewpoint. 

If you want to continue seeing the situation we have just prior to GE 2015 then spoiling, not voting, active disillusionment is for you. The SNP are not winning the majority of Scottish seats because the population is very happy with fptp and the labour / conservative divide. Indeed they claimed on Tuesday that they will campaign for voting reform to bring Westminster closer to the effective proportional representation system up at Holyrood. Voting SNP is the current best way for Scots to effectively demonstrate their disillusionment. 

I hope my post adds some perspective that might be useful. It's your choice on the day, but neither choice should be mocked. After all, ancestors didn't fight to make voting mandatory, they fought to give people the free choice. 

Kind regards,

NaePish

[From the report commissioned by Tony Blair in 1998](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140131031506/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/chap-5.htm):

&gt;  Beyond this AV on its own suffers from a stark objection. It offers little prospect of a move towards greater proportionality, and in some circumstances, and those the ones which certainly prevailed at the last election and may well do so for at least the next one, it is even less proportional that FPTP. Simulations of how the 1997 result might have come out under AV suggest that it would have significantly increased the size of the already swollen Labour majority. A 'best guess' projection of the shape of the current Parliament under AV suggests on one highly reputable estimate the following outcome with the actual FPTP figures given in brackets after the projected figures: Labour 452 (419), Conservative 96 (165), Liberal Democrats 82 (46), others 29 (29). The overall Labour majority could thus have risen from 169 to 245. On another equally reputable estimate the figures are given as Labour 436, Conservatives 110, Liberal Democrats 84 and others 29, an overall majority this time of 213. On either basis an injustice to the Liberal Democrats would have been nearly two-thirds corrected (their strictly proportional entitlement was 111 seats) but at the price of a still greater injustice to the Conservatives. **The Conservative 30.7% of the votes should strictly have given them 202 seats. Instead FPTP gave them 165 or 25% of the seats, whereas AV would have given them on one estimate only 96 (or 14.6% of the seats), and on the more favourable one from their point of view 110 seats (or 16.7% of the total).**

Their first thought was always that private is better and more efficient while the state is stagnant and incompetent. Rather than sticking to their principles of broad socialism they abandoned Clause 4 which spoke of the ownership of the means of production and instead championed big business and rising inequality, though that's not how they referred to it. 

Ideologically they shifted to the right, or at least towards the centre to try and woo voters in the Shires and became more a European style social democratic party than a socialist one; the ""lite"" element is that they have been less keen to push the interests of private finance wholly at the expense of the poor, hence bringing in strange little compromises like tax credits which is just a subsidy to companies to pay a below par wage. They still believed in redistributing wealth, but not in the same quantities as previous Labour administrations, or Tory ones for that matter. 

""Red Ed"" is a scaremongering tactic - there are only a handful of people who could really be classed as socialist by their actions and words and usually these are nowhere near the top of the Labour Party; they remain back-benchers.

We need a proven, international class striker who will GUARANTEE goals. And we need to throw as much money at that target as possible.

Martinez, Mandzukic, Higuain are all relatively attainable and have reasons to leave.

Martinez plays for Porto, who will ALWAYS sell if they get a decent enough offer, and I can't imagine he's happy playing in the Portugese league forever.

Mandzukic, for some unknown reason, doesn't seem to be trusted by Simeone despite once again being his usual reliable source of hard work, pressing and goals.

Higuain is playing for the fourth best team in Italy, a substantially weaker league, and is likely to play Europa League football next year.

All of them are around 27/28, and for Â£30-35million could be bought IMO. These are the players we should look at first.

Before people say ""oh well they'll be off to bigger clubs"", there aren't THAT many bigger clubs who have a pressing need for a striker. Besides, these sorts of signings are what makes clubs bigger; if we want to reach the pinnacle we have to aim for these players.

I rate people like Vietto, Dybala, Lacazette, Son; but we need instant goals and consistent goals. These guys have been there and done that.

null,false,twersx,eng-manchester,Lying in a pool of my own blood outside Birdcage,null,"You can use a form of open party list which is how PR is implemented in most European countries. Essentially, you'd have x number of representatives in a region. The voter votes for one candidate. First that vote is counted into the party/proportional system, so if I vote for Douglas Carswell, it counts as a vote for UKIP. after all the votes are tallied, seats are assigned based on votes attained (the method behind this can vary a lot) so let's say in this constituency, UKIP got 3 of the seats up for grabs. At that point, you look at the share of the vote each UKIP candidate would get, so let's say Carswell got 10298 votes and the next UKIP candidate got 7658 votes, Carswell would be the first MP, then the next guy, then the guy after. 

But if we say Farage was also running in that constituency and his running siphoned some of Carswell's votes AND drew some other votes, so Farage ended up with 9768 while Carswell got 8678 then Farage would have priority over Carswell, and the guy who got 7658 votes in the previous example would not become an MP.

This system actually still has problems; if I like Carswell but hate the rest of UKIP, then voting for Carswell is both for and against my interests. So let's say I think UKIP and Carswell are popular enough to get elected, I want to vote for Ken Clark because I also like him, but I don't think he is popular enough with the voters to get in over other Tories who I don't like.

In my opinion, an open party list would A) drive politics away from notable individuals outside of leaders and senior members (you wouldn't have a left leaning constituency constantly voting for a Tory backbencher who the electorate really felt was a great MP) and B) the ability for smaller parties to get seats would lead to the large parties breaking up as the One Nationers and Euroskeptics who feel marginalised by the Thatcherites would leave to form their own parties over which they had more control/influence, and the Euroskeptics in UKIP who don't like much else of the platform could form their own left-wing anti-EU party with the Labour Euroskeptics.

David Cameron called Russell Brand a joke for interviewing Milliband. What does it say about him that he's so heavily supported in THE SUN.

THE SUN jumps seamlessly from the *everything's so comical* court jester to some of the most hate filled bile that you'll ever read.

The Millibrand interview did not make me want to vote for him, and I find Russell Brands position increasingly naive. However, it was not a joke. It was a serious political interview of a higher caliber than I've seen anything Cameron has done since the start of this general election. The press in this country is a joke. Its such a joke that a spiritualist comedian, who the prime minister refers to as a ""Joke"", has done a better job. 

*""Look at him fail to eat a bacon sandwich""* should be a part of the punishment we give Murdoch when it comes time to fuck him and his pathetic wealth obsessed club of jokes.
I hope Milliband wins and unleashes his anger on him. He's a smart enough politician to cover it up now, but I bet underneath he's seething with rage at the tabloids that needed to be reigned in decades ago.

A degree is *really* helpful but - and I don't say this lightly - it's not the only thing we look for.

* A GitHub.com portfolio - shows us evidence that you know how to code, how to use SCM tools, the quality of your bug reports, and how you respond to criticism.
* A blog - shows us how you learn, how you explain things to others, what discoveries you've made.
* Hackathons - have you attended? Have you won?  How well do you do in ad-hoc teams?
* Prizes and Awards - are you entering competitions which pit you against other, better coders?
* Voluntary work - have you set up a Code Club to get kids / parents interested in coding?
* Business acumen - are you running a successful eBay account to pay your rent? Are you selling software / support?

All those things push a good candidate up to great.

Computer Science isn't your only option at university.  I did applied computing (with a minor in Chinese) - you can look at computer engineering, computing and business, there are even degrees which specialise in video games (design - not playing!)

If you are extremely motivated and can sustain yourself while developing a kick-arse portfolio and learning new languages and techniques and get involved in local groups and develop your team working abilities - there's not much advantage in going to University.  Find a good apprenticeship and learn on the job.

Foot-like words have the [""Near-Close Near-Back Rounded Vowel""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-back_vowel) and strut-like words have something like the [""Open-Mid Back Unrounded Vowel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel). In the North both of these sets are pronounced the same, with the vowel from 'foot'. So pus sounds like puss, put sounds like putt, luck sounds like look. This is on account of a phonological split that began in the South some time before the 1640s, but never caught on in the North.

I don't actually have any problem with people receiving benefits. Its people who abuse the system that I have a problem with. I therefore support welfare reform that cracks down on that, and I think caps on the total amount received are correct as well. It can't be fair when some people receive more than the average salary in entitlements. And surely you must agree that problems of third generation worklessness need to be addressed? Would you not be prepared to admit that in certain areas cultures of welfare dependency have arisen? 

As to people in mansions in Monaco... what's wrong with people making money? Its what capitalist economic and technological progress relies on, and has done since the modern enlightenment period onwards.

It ain't the state that provides us flat screen TVs, ipads, low cost air fares and the other great comforts and boons of the modern age. Its entrepreneurs pursuing the profit motive. Let them keep their profits. 

Capitalism, job opportunities and wealth creation take millions more people out of poverty every year than welfarism.

&gt;The New Hope for Britain (1983) called for unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Economic Community, abolition of the House of Lords, and the re-nationalisation of recently de-nationalised industries like British Telecom, British Aerospace, and the British Shipbuilders Corporation.

It didn't go well for them, for additional reasons beyond that (Falklands, etc.) and since then and especially since Mr Blair they have moved towards the centre, and with some economic policies, even beyond the centre towards things the Tories would be doing too.

Labour supporters don't call him Red Ed â that's a lazy thing thrown around by people on the right who think anyone who isn't with them is a Communist (because there's only ""their way"" or Communist, right?)

But was then changed to:

&gt;The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our *common endeavour* we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few, where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.",null,0,null,1430907604,null,0,false,0,cr02ows,null,t3_351f9q,null,t1_cr02ows,null,t3_351f9q,null,null,null,1432801286,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

I'm not sure freezing up government by voting against everything that wasn't 100% their policy would have been very productive at the time, not just for them wanting to get their many other pledges through, but also not for the public in general. 

Related to this I think people expect too much from government and not enough from themselves. It's a two way street and I think education is the key. I think people shouldn't expect the answers or solutions to always be possible, or to always rain down on them from 'above' simply because they voted for these other people to try and do a job. (e.g. Short of abandoning a number of civil liberties, there isn't that much that can realistically be done about inequality -- the rich will *always* do well; this is why they're still rich and rich in the first place, even after whatever form of redistribution suits your fancy.) 

That's not to say we shouldn't try, but with the Tories holding the stronger mandate from the people, I don't understand why people's expectations were in a certain place. On austerity in particular I think this has become a pejorative synonymous with neoliberal, simply meaning 'economic policy I disagree with.' I think there is some truth to the exaggerated nature of their claims (e.g. equating Britain to Greece) and the pace they undertook deficit reduction; this was damaging and perhaps unnecessary (although it will really depend who you ask; even economists disagree on the finer points). It's an interesting debate that in my view boils down to the question 'Do we take the risks now, or the risks later; some will be aggrieved regardless.' [This general debate on economics is quite interesting.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012wxyg) 

Jargon is not always helpful but in my view it helps to know the detail as it helps clarify. Over simplifying leads people to assume Lib/Lab/Con are all the same party which couldn't be further from the truth. Really it just fits the us vs them, people vs elites, anti-establishment vs establishment narrative that I think represents a somewhat false dichotomy.

Something can be both socialist and an economic stimulus, or only one of the two. The ideas really don't have to be related. If you ask me, some of the Green's plans are socialist and others aren't. Giving state money to private companies to spend on certain projects does not constitute socialism. Nationalising those companies probably would (some socialists would disagree, but, y'know, whatever).

null,false,goolies,null,null,null,"I think there are a couple of reasons:

* If you want to ever have a realistic chance of change in your constituency you have to vote. If a large number of people in a safe seat don't bother to vote it'll always look unassailably safe - but if this election there's a swing of even just a couple of % points away from the sitting MP it could encourage more people to vote next time. Change doesn't come overnight!

* The national share of the vote also makes a difference. Clegg has been talking a lot about how important it is for a government to 'have a mandate' and that he'll try and form a coalition with the biggest party. If you want a labour government, but because of people in tory safe seats not voting they gain only 25% of the national vote, they'll be very easily shot down for not having a mandate.

* If you think the electoral system is broken and we need a fairer system where votes like yours aren't 'wasted', the strongest evidence for that is the number of votes cast by people in your position. The greater the number of 'wasted' votes the more apparent it is to everyone how unfair the system is.

* If you really are fed up and disagree with all of the above, you should probably consider spoiling your ballot. Spoilt ballots are counted and are considered an expression of dissatisfaction.


Not voting when you are politically engaged is self-defeating. By all means campaign and do whatever you can to voice your unhappiness with the system.

I worked in politics and came up with ways to engage particular groups of people. For example, if I saw someone's record of not voting in primaries, but voted in a general election, they were prime targets for a middle-of-the-road political candidate like mine. We did everything we could to appeal to them. Same as here. Tons of people vote, it's recorded and boom..data. No smart politician ignores the voting breakdown. It's like a pilot not doing anything but looking ahead and ignoring the flight deck. 

Candidates and parties look at the data that helps shape their policies. Convincing people otherwise who already have it in their heads that candidates don't is a lost cause. Letters, visits and voting helps. Period. I've seen and experienced it firsthand back in the states. Yes, I know it's not the same, but you do make a difference.

I just voted green in my first ever election and I'm confident that people will see my vote. Yes, the greens don't stand a chance right now, but if my MP thinks I don't talk or won't encourage others next time around, he/she is wrong (I only recently received citizenship and felt uncomfortable campaigning when I wasn't a citizen). WE collectively make a difference. End of story. I'll fucking stand for election if it ain't right! :-) Hell, this is now my country as well.

You could get the National Express from Stansted Airport at 23:15 pm and arrive at Oxford bus station at 3:10 am for Â£28.

Then you would have to get a taxi at 3:10am or a bit later from Oxford Bus Station to Bristol Airport, which according to Google maps takes 1 hour 50 minutes and is 92.5 miles.

Which will still be expensive but I'm guessing it's a lot cheaper than getting a taxi the whole way which would be almost 3 hours. But the taxi could speed a little!

Say a married couple used their sperm and eggs and put into a 3rd party surrogate. Biologically the baby is not related to the surrogate at all. However the surrogate is still the legal mother and can keep the child if she wishes.

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"As I understand it, if the biological parents aren't married the mother has sole ""parental responsibility"" - although it is quite easy for the father (biological or otherwise) to acquire it; either by them entering into a formal ""parental responsibility agreement"" or by him being entered on the birth certificate.

In this case, though, the Court didn't just find that the biological father should get parental responsibility, but *both* the fathers should. So the biological father's partner is now the child's father as well.

In a cheating wife, I'm not sure. The law is a bit unclear as it doesn't seem to define ""father"", but states that if a child's father and mother were married then the father has parental responsibility. I think this means that the husband would be the legal father unless the contrary was shown. But this wouldn't stop him from entering into a parental responsibility agreement giving the biological father parental custody as well.

Iirc the law doesn't care just about biology/genetics.

The agreement seems to have been relevant because it is possible for someone with parental responsibility to ""subcontract"" that responsibility to another through an agreement - they don't lose responsibility but the other party kind of gets it. But as the judge noted, this whole area of surrogate parents is a mess legally due to it all being based on a single sentence in the relevant law or something (although there is a specific set of rules for IVF etc. parents, including provisions for a child to have two mothers, but only if there involves some official medical intervention or whatever).

For me the big deal about this case is that the parents being gay doesn't matter (even though the woman tried to make it). In contrast to maybe 20 years ago where the courts could have a strongly anti-gay feel, here it is an issue; there's no argument of ""a child must have a mother"" or ""gay people aren't suitable parents"" or any of that stuff.",null,0,null,1430910328,null,0,false,0,cr03c5t,null,t3_351e7c,null,t1_cr03c5t,null,t1_cr02idr,null,null,null,1432801591,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
null,false,helix1512,null,null,null,"The Lib Dems would have been able to form a minority coalition with Labour (and SNP/DUP) if they had really wanted to. I know it would go against political etiquette to form a coalition with the party that didn't win the most votes, and normally they would have no right to do that, but they had ONE pledge, and not only did they break it, but they made things 3 times worse than they were before. If that is the main pledge that they are elected on, then it is their prerogative to say to Conservatives, 'This is a no-negotiation zone. If you don't wanna budge then I will align with Labour.' They did have power, Clegg just relinquished it when he rolled over as easily as he did. I don't see how the ConDem coalition legitimately held a strong mandate than a LabLib coalition, as 23% of voters got exactly the opposite of what they wanted. Labour and Lib Dems together would have formed 52% of the vote, and the fringe parties could have supported on a case-by-case basis. You might not think it would be very productive, but it would have been far more democratic than the reality of the last 5 years, and I don't think we would be any worse off.

I wholeheartedly agree with you about people expecting too much from government. We can't sit around and not engage in direct action, then complain about the state of the country. Unfortunately, education is the key, and I don't think the government has done enough to promote political education. Certainly citizenship lessons do not galvanise the younger generation, and jargon as at least a semi-deliberate ploy aimed at keeping political knowledge away from the majority of the working class. I'm sure there's a subconscious reluctance to really effectively improve political education, as it would increase the threat to the status quo. Unfortunately, media is the other key to education, and this is where the populace is really being brought to their knees. They use the power of rhetoric, emotive rather than factual arguments, and conflicting and contradictory stories, to the end that there is rarely a clear, collective, coherent narrative in societal discourse, which prevents a lot of people from being able to believe in a cause strongly enough to proactively engage in direct action. Media policy is the first thing I would reform to improve the political and societal landscape.
Yes, the rich will always do well, I'm not suggesting a communist-style redistribution of wealth. What I am suggesting is that contradictory policies like Â£80odd billion of austerity cuts while pumping billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing, the majority of which money went directly to the rich - admitted by the Bank of England (and a figure that was equivalent to giving each family Â£24,000). THATS why people are pissed off. That kind of inequality, something could have been done to avoid, and the public were powerless to stop it because we weren't even told it was happening.

Maybe I'm biased, but certainly the majority I have read, including that article I linked a couple of comments earlier, seems to indicate that austerity measures (and I use these terms not as pejorative terms, but as summative descriptors) implemented by Osborne were insidiously sold to the public, who were deliberately not made aware of the repercussions that economic philosophy would have. If we're talking about the necessity of jargon, then how come all cards were not placed on the table from the start, and it's only now we're hearing about the sleight of hand and dodgy claims that our economic recovery was grounded on? I will listen to the link you posted tonight!
I of course don't think that Lib/Lab/Con are all the same, but in terms of a progression to moral politics, I don't think its unfair to at least partially group them together. I do differentiate at least between UKIP/Con, who in my view engage in conscious tactics to take advantage of our mental weaknesses, and the rest of them. Unfortunately, morality has left politics, and by far the most effective way to bring it back is to great this dichotomy where it is people who care about the common man vs people that want to entrench the political status quo. Clearly its not as simple as that, and some people/parties might get lumped on the wrong side at times, but in terms of galvanising the masses and encouraging direct action, anything much more complex switches people off. We have to accept that most people are just not interested in politics enough to delve deeper than that. All they know is, they're not being represented well enough. Get them involved, get them proactive, and then once they're interested, they will be engaged enough to think about the complexities.

Little bit disappointed that some people have down-voted just because they disagree, but how will I or anyone ever develop and learn if they only hear people who agree with them!

The idea is that you sell a bunch of the shares to ""known"" companies or individuals before opening it to the public at a predetermined price based on it's value.

You do this so that once it goes live the price doesn't resemble a tsunami and stops it being hugely volatile in the opening period.

Unfortunately, depending on who you believe, the Conservatives 'accidentally' hugely undervalued the shares they sold to - literally - their friends. One of the individuals who got some shares was the fucking Best Man at George Osborne wedding.

The 'deal' is that you're not supposed to sell those shares. You're 'chosen' because you agree to not sell immediately if the price goes up. You're supposed to see it as a ""long term investment"", not a smash and grab robbery.

Well, guess what happened. They hugely undervalued it and a lot of the people who weren't supposed to sell simply sold. And they raked in **millions**. They might as well have taken it straight out of the government bank accounts because our tax money generated that value to begin with. Then those fucking assholes pocketed it all.

And lets keep in mind the entire sale was ridiculed from step one. And people were calling them out on undervalueing it before it went live.

They knew. They didn't care. It was as close to embezzlement you can get.

Like I keep harking on about, the lesser of two evils may not seem that important to you, but to thousands of people in the country it is the difference between their life being bearable or not. I find it extraordinarily  arrogant to suggest that a policy shift as big as the bedroom tax is not worth your time or consideration. And as I've also said, it smacks of people too privileged or ignorant to understand how high the stakes are for millions of people on the breadline as it is.

a constituency with 6 members would elect a total of 6 MPs to represent them. 

The method by which STV normally works would be indistinguishable from AV if it were used in a constituency that was electing just one MP.

Edit: to clarify, AV basically says ""we are electing one person, we all vote and if nobody gets 50% of the vote we will eliminate the last place person and ask that person's supporters who they would like to support, and this will repeat until we have one person getting 50% of the vote""

STV uses a formula to determine how many votes you need to get one of the seats up for grabs. If nobody has enough votes to breach that number, the last place candidates are replaced and votes trasnferred until somebody is over the threshold. However that doesn't happen until the final seats are being awarded (most of the time). Initially, you'll have candidates who have over the threshold immediately. They are awarded a seat and their excess votes are transferred based on preference to other candidates.

In a constituency with just 1 seat available, there are no initial winners or surplus votes to reallocate so it immediately will eliminate the last place candidates and redistribute their votes until one candidate has enough votes.",null,0,null,1430911630,null,0,1430912203,0,cr03p7z,null,t3_34yyc1,null,t1_cr03p7z,null,t1_cr03ft8,null,null,null,1432801762,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

6. He's played 3 times more than Townsend, whose goal and assist-rate per minute is superior to Lamela (even excluding penalties). I do not think Townsend is a better option than Lamela, I'm just putting things in perspective.

Like regular jury service, super jury service would be open to discussion and postponement.

The role of the super jury would be to temporarily veto legislation (up to the length of the jury's term + 3 weeks into the next jury), and to dissolve Parliament with a super-majority. To support them in this role, there would be a comprehensive team of legal advisers (not dissimilar to how magistrates are advised).

The jurors would be based from their nearest main city, and work would be done via video-conference.

Barcelona's record against Abramovich's 11-man Chelsea: 0-4-3

And everyone knows Lionel Messi has failed to score against Chelsea in like the 8 matches he's played against them.

Also everyone knows about the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich.

Simply put, Chelsea's veterans know how to grind out wins against offensive teams like Barcelona and Bayern Munich.  Even though 6 of the 10 matches against Barcelona were under Jose Mourinho, Chelsea still are undefeated against Barcelona under Guus Hiddink and Roberto di Matteo.  They both would've won their ties too, if it wasn't for Ovrebo against Hiddink.

Let me remind you that the 2012 team that beat Barcelona and Bayern Munich was the weakest team Chelsea have ever had under Abramovich: they finished 6th in the Premier League.  This is not a one-off ""Chelsea can do it if they get lucky,"" they know how to make their luck against the big teams.

Moreover let's not forget that Simeone actually likes Mandzu a lot. Before the CL game against Madrid Simeone said in the conference that Mandzu went to his home with a translator just to say that he won't be able to give his best (Simeone was going to play Mandzu regardless and it didn't matter that it's a big game) and actually Simeone trusted Mandzu too much that he was going to play him fully knowing that he recieved a knock.


Now, it's known that Lacazette won't really leave Lyon this year so we shouldn't pay that much attention to him. Signing the french League's top goal scorer would be huge for us (and too good to be true). I actually see him becoming better that Giroud (who was the french league's top scorer and winner before going to another english team).


The only top striker that we can get in the summer is Jackson Martinez but his price is going to be so inflated because Porto are cunts.


I just hope that we get either Mandzu or Jackson but it's too good to be true and we'll probably end up with someone like Immobile :/

I'm absolutely convinced that sometimes whataboutism is a legitimate argument and sometimes it isn't, and I'm sure there must be some logical reason why I feel that way.

For example you're absolutely right that it is not a good argument to say, ""You should be grateful your contract is zero-hour rather than basically sweat-shop slavery. The government has no obligation to fix zero-hour contracts until China has comparable welfare laws to the UK"", but it might be a reasonable argument to say, ""You should be grateful for even a zero-hour contract given the state of the economy. The government should not fix zero-hour contracts until the economy picks up."" (I'm not saying *I* would say that, just that one looks a lot more reasonable than the other on the face of it). One area where I get particularly riled up about this is the semi-monthly, 'animal cruelty' threads on reddit, where some company is caught treating animals badly and reddit gets outraged; it seems totally reasonable for me (a vegetarian) to point out that it is hypocritical to complain about - for example - halal slaughter when much crueler methods are used in the production of meat elsewhere, but it would seem ridiculous to say, ""You care about animals? WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE KILLED BY INADEQUATE SEATBELT LAWS?!!""

I kind of feel - intuatively - like this article is the second kind of whataboutism; the kind where it is reasonable to make the comparison. I couldn't tell you why, but maybe it is the sense that people are only complaining about the advert because of its saliency and therefore it is reasonable to direct their attention elsewhere, or the sense that the people complaining about the advert are part of the same reference class as the people who are affected by N Ireland's abortion laws (as in, we can vote for a government who promises to sort out the problem of both N Ireland's abortion laws and sexist adverts, but we can't vote for a government that will end exploitative work practices in China).

That doesn't make what is happening on a poster any better or worse. If the poster is sexist you are allowed to express your opinion without checking whether you tick the boxes appropriate such as protesting Northern Irish policies. Feminists in England and Wales will support abortion rights in Northern Ireland but that's an on going issue just because it isn't in the news all the time doesn't mean people aren't trying. One does not remove from the other and attempting to devalue the backlash the sexist poster company received in this headline isn't helpful either.

Feminists aren't what is letting you down it's the people of Northern Ireland. People don't like telling other nations how to live their lives due to backlash. This can be seen clearly with English people reluctant to tell the Scottish people how to vote.  

&gt;But living in Northern Ireland, itâs still easy to feel weâve been let down by the feminist movement. Perhaps they worry that itâs not their place to get involved. Perhaps its been so long since Britain debated abortion rights that they think itâs something that only happens in history books, not NHS hospitals in 2015. Perhaps they feel weâre so backward that weâre a lost cause.

She honestly hits the nail on the head (other than the self depreciating backwards comment) in this paragraph and bringing awareness that this is an ongoing issue will help women of Northern Ireland. But you don't need to tie the two events  together.

EDIT: /u/ox_ Makes the excellent point that feminists would all see the abortion problems as a bigger issue but it's also easier to deal with the one company rather than the complex nature of Northern Irish politics.

While you're probably right, and you probably saw that ICM constituency poll a few days ago that put him ahead, I can cheer you up a little bit about that. The ICM poll (which put him 7 pts ahead) only had a sample size of 500- meaning a margin of error of 6 pts. The previous Ashcroft poll (which had Labour ahead by 1 pt) had a 1000+ sample, so a standard 3 pt margin of error. In other words, it's entirely possible that there was no swing at all, or only a small swing. That's the problem with infrequently polled demographics like individual constituencies- no big picture. The other thing to remember is that Tory tactical voters are less likely to turn out for their second choice than their first choice- something which isn't reflected in the methodologies.

Trains from London go from Euston. Book on either Virgin Trains website or London Midland website. To get to this from Heathrow take the Piccadilly line all the way from Heathrow to either: Leicester Square and change for the Northern Line to Euston, or get it all the way to Kings Cross and walk down Euston Road, not really worth changing onto the Circle/Hammersmith &amp; City to Euston Square. Just the tube journey would be about an hour, getting a coach from Heathrow will probably be a better option.

What the LDs did was both stupid and noble, but I respect them for the latter.

Yes, they reneged on promises important to their membership audience (young liberals), but in true British fashion: it could have been a lot worse.

What would you have preferred? A minority conservative government followed by another GE two years down the line as a result of either no confidence or growing Tory support? That's no way to run a country.

What I meant by 'there was no way to keep them out of 'power'' was that, if the Tories are going to form a government anyway, isn't it better from a LD perspective to have an influence on that government? They were never going to stop the Tories (the Lib Dems actually **lost** 5 seats in 2010), so they could either have a measurable impact on government, or join the rabble in wishing the destabilisation of parliament.

And under Labour you got most of the same - they tried to sell off Royal Mail, they gave lucrative contracts to their own donors or companies who would pay them back later (like Patricia Hewitt, who handed lots of NHS stuff to BT and then became a BT board member).

&gt; Historically see also gas and electricity network, railways, waste and freshwater services. The list is huge. For the uneducated a fine clue that an asset used to be owned by the public is the inclusion of the name British, British Petroleum, British Gas, British Telecommunications, British Aerospace, British Airways.

Do all of these things need to be state owned?

The rail infrastructure is back in public hands (and it would be trivial for any government to bring train operations back - why didn't Labour do it in 13 years?) and for some of the rest, privatisation was what was needed. Privatising BT and allowing/forcing competition has worked wonders. I don't think it's correct to assume that somehow we'd have low energy prices and 100Gbit broadband to the home under state ownership - we still don't have a really universal rail network, for example - some areas deal with unreliability and slow speeds and others get fast, frequent, reliable service",null,0,null,1430914366,null,0,1430915225,0,cr04ktp,null,t3_34z7jl,null,t1_cr04ktp,null,t1_cr03wr0,null,null,null,1432802176,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

How? They pay tuition fees for university. They pay tuition fees for clinical school.

And then they continue to work whilst receiving *on the job training*. They have to pay for their own exams and study (and believe me it's expensive). 

Imagine a job where the contract says that anything you've learnt whilst on the job will be valued and billed to you at the end. Really?

The facts are:

1. A proportion of long-term unemployed/underemployed lack basic skills, which makes them essentially unemployable. A number of these people lack the motivation to learn these skills.
1. Endemic unemployment is highly concentrated in certain destitute areas of the country. These areas are destitute because the industries they depended on have been redundant for decades in our economy, and still no new industries are moving in. These areas also have high crime and illness rates, and poor schools.
1. The nature of industry now means that the amount of jobs available for people who have basic skills but no specialised skills are falling fast. This is why we send so many kids to university or push them towards apprenticeships. Those who slip through the net are more likely to be concentrated in the destitute areas that I described above, which pushes these places into a circle of poverty.

At what point does terrorism turn into freedom fighting (or vice versa)? At what point does repressive or unjust government action justify counter action? 

There have been [reports](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mps-report-benefits-cuts-driving-5388705) of people committing suicide because of this governments impact on the welfare state, and many are resorting to food banks.

There has to be a tipping point somewhere, right? (Again, not saying we're at it, this article just got me thinking).

I see this as the best of both worlds, it does rely on using party lists for around half of MPs which I get that some people are against, however I think it's simpler and easier to transition to from our current system than STV. It allows better local representation than STV as the constituencies can remain smaller (up to twice as large for MMP but they'd need to be at least 3-5 times as large for STV to get a somewhat proportional result) and also a more proportional result overall (party lists can be directly proportional, STV can still lock small parties out unless the constituencies are really big with lots of MPs).",null,0,null,1430915315,null,0,false,0,cr04x9n,null,t3_351cg2,null,t1_cr04x9n,null,t1_cr04kng,null,null,null,1432802338,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

- Mikel is NOT a liability. He's been injured a good amount of the season. ""I never rated him as a top player"". Well sucks for you because Mourinho, one of the best and most defensively intelligent managers ever, does rate him. And rates him enough to sub him in with a 1 goal lead. 

- Kakuta is probably never going to be our ""best or second best player"". That is just wrong on so many levels. And we haven't ""ruined his career"". He's only 23 and can still have a decent career, it probably just won't be with a top club.

- Cuadrado was not just brought in ""because so many other BPL teams wanted him""...why would any team, even RM or Barcelona, spend Â£27m just for the sake of pissing off a rival?! Especially nowadays with FFP. He's a great player who had an outstanding World Cup and has has a few good seasons in Serie A. He hasn't featured as much because attempting to integrate a player into the starting team in the middle of a league-winning season is exactly how you lose the league.

- And saying we don't need to sign anyone just makes you seem oblivious. Our team is great, one of the best in Europe, but there is ALWAYS room for improvement. If you say that a team who lost a lead TWICE against a 10-man PSG at Stamford Bridge doesn't need to sign any reinforcements, you clearly need to go get your eyes and ears checked.

&gt;Do you seriously think that 'You can choose to ignore it' nullifies the concept of verbal abuse

Yes, to me abuse is something you can't ignore. It's forced on you. If you can just walk away from it without being affected, or if it's theoretically possible for you to never even be aware of it in the first place, I don't think you should call that abuse.

&gt;or it doesn't count because its written down? 

No, it being written down isn't the issue, it's the aim and intent of the comment. if he sent her several emails detailing his awful opinions about her, that would be abuse. Just like flooding someone's letterbox with hateful letters would be abuse, calling a stranger a cunt to their face would be abuse.

This was a conversation *about her* that she was not personally involved in and wouldn't have known about if someone hadn't taken the time to tell her.

If you can get a flight to London Luton, you can avoid London entirely. Alternatively, if you don't mind spending a bit longer on the journey, you could come into Stansted, catch the train up to Cambridge and then the X5 coach up to Milton Keynes, again avoiding London.

As for trains and booking: www.nationalrail.co.uk is the main site for searching all trains. You can't book there, but you can click through to a train company's site and book the tickets there. (Personally, I tend to book through London Midland's site for most tickets: www.londonmidland.com) Don't use www.thetrainline.com - it charges you booking fees.

You can book online with a credit card (or a debit card provided it has a card number of the right type), just be aware that your bank may / will charge you for a foreign payment. The advantage of booking online is that you may be able get an ""advance"" fare; this is cheaper, but ties you to a specific train, so if you're doing this, leave time for delays to your flight etc. You'd either have to pay for international postage or go for the option where you collect at the machine. Otherwise, you can buy on the day, either from a staffed ticket desk or from a machine.

Oyster cards only work in London; it may be useful whilst your girlfriend visits, as it's the best way to pay for public transport (you can use NFC on your card, but this may not be ideal because the system charges you once per day AFAIK, so potentially multiple foreign transaction fees, depending on your bank).

For booking UK trains try http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ - you can search and book all trains from there.  The easiest mechanism to get tickets is to get a reference number - then there are machines at most stations where you can enter the reference number and it will print out your tickets.

Or I think you can buy tickets at Heathrow - not sure - and sometimes tickets are a lot cheaper to buy in advance.

There are two ways from Heathrow to London - the [""Heathrow Express""](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/) which is very fast, but pricey - Â£21 one-way at a minimum.  Or you can get the tube all the way, which is slower but cheaper - and now you don't need an Oyster, you can pay with a nfc credit card (though I haven't tried this myself).

You don't need to engage in a ""what about"" mentality. If that were the case then no one has a right to complain about anything except the most urgent serious issues since anything trivial will, by comparison to serious international issues, seem trivial. Every issue stands on its own and if someone wants to complain about whether the Samsung s6 doesn't quite have enough battery life, or whether short double yellow lines on some road are unreasonable or if an hour long commute to work is too long then they are free to do so. 

The argument ""what about x issue though"" is a red herring. It doesn't add anything to a debate. Because then any issue, regardless of merits, can't be debated since ""children starving in Africa is more important so stop complaining and just appreciate what you have"". That's of course completely nonsensical. 

I think the article is just juxtaposing the issue of abortion rights with the breach body adverts - it fits in with the theme of the article that English laws on abortion are so far ahead of northern Ireland that English people have the luxury of focusing on issues like an advert (not that messages in adverts needs to be shelved until abortion reform in NI). 

Edit: the reason that you probably feel the ""what about"" argument is valid is because it actually sometimes is valid but it depends on context (usually issues of time or resource rather than merit). For example, if a local council needs to spend either on building new homes or upgrading transport in an area then you can debate about which is more pressing. But if, for example, people are complaining about whether there is sufficient access for disabled people on the London underground then it is completely irrelevant to argue that ""well most places in Africa don't even have public transport so just be grateful for what we have and focus on development in Africa"". 

Edit2: the other reason the "" what about"" argument is shit is that it's not like everyone is only entitled to care about or act upon one issue at a time until it is resolved. I'm fully capable of commenting on adverts in London and supporting abortion laws in northern Ireland in the same day.

Well good.  But my point is that if feminists don't want their movement to be associated with extremism or craziness then they have a duty to stand up to those who are publicly speaking in their name if and when they feel that those speakers are mischaracterizing feminism.

A small party like UKIP needs to fill all of those parliamentary seats and its inevitable that a (any amount) right wing party will collect some bottom feeding idiots who have some extreme views. Policing their own party through suspensions like this should be viewed as a good thing.

Ok, and why don't you do that?

The purpose of money is to achieve goals. If you want a house, you have the money to buy a house, using this large deposit (I think).

There is no point having this money sitting there doing fuck all, because that doesn't achieve your goals.

This capital could be earning more, but typically investments should be made with a timescale exceeding 5 or 10 years. 

I feel like you're wobbling over what to do with this money, like you feel obliged to be more prudent with it, but you don't know what you want.

If you want a house, buy a house. If you don't then lock the money away in longterm savings (i.e. towards your pension) and forget about it.

This country has an obsession with house-ownership - it's perceived as security and ""not throwing your money away"" and a solid investment.

In fact, house ownership has costs - like mortgage interest, insurance, maintenance, new boilers and painting and doing up the bathroom - which you never see back. And house ownership is an impediment to your freedom - it makes it harder to accept a job in another town or country, or to backpack around the world.

Meanwhile, index funds are also secure investments, which will provide for your future, and returns on these investments are about the same magnitude. 

Whether you invest this money in a house or savings, it can make a huge difference to your future - when you retire in your old age, or allowing you to retire early or have employment freedom in a decade or two.

But you have to make a decision and think longterm, and not just dismiss your opportunities as ""a joke"" because they're not immediate enough.

null,false,beatlesbible,null,null,null,"&gt; Copyright isn't the only license - it's just the only one that people tend to think of, at least at first.

Your party's policy only mentions copyright, and fails to outline a workable alternative. Shouldn't that be addressed before you talk about automatic removal of the rights to artistic ownership?

&gt; We can still have intellectual property respected and the original creator can still make money from it without it being as massively restricted as it is now.

By that logic, why have a 10-year limit for copyright at all? Why not axe it and force everyone to adopt a CC licence instead?

&gt; Also the music industry isn't suffering because copyright isn't tight enough - it's suffering because it's just too damn tight! For every 19 pounds a regular copyright respecting user spends, a pirate, someone who doesn't really respect copyright, spends 26 pounds. Pirates are showing us in real time that copyright being broken is exactly what the digital economy needs.

You do know that correlation does not imply causation, right? Large consumers of content may well be likely to pirate material before spending money on it. They try before they buy. I don't have a problem with that. Those people are already in the business of paying for content. It doesn't necessarily follow that everyone would do the same if copyright terms were reduced or abandoned. We simply don't know if revenues would inevitably rise. Personally I doubt it. In countries where piracy is particularly rife I'm not sure that the citizens are climbing over each other to pay for creative content.

&gt; If you're worried about the artist themselves, the music industry is the most exploitive industry on the plant and movie producers are turning over constant record profits. The artists never get their due and it's not because of pirates or anti-copyright campaigners, it's because these huge companies horde copyright and choke out the artist from sharing, often, their own work.

The music and film industry models may well be broken, but that doesn't mean copyright has failed. The problems you mention are more to do with exploitative contracts and avaricious companies, and are not relevant to the hordes of self-published authors or self-releasing musicians who are bypassing the traditional model, or to those whose artistic creations may become commercially viable after your arbitrary 10-year timeframe.

By taking away the ownership of a creation you're not just hurting the big studios and labels that you might dislike - you're also hurting independent artists, labels, studios, authors, publishers, writers etc, and we'll be culturally poorer if their output declines or stops because they can no longer make money from it. But hey, take the food off their tables. I'm sure it's for the wider good of society.

&gt; We also find when trust is placed in the public, through companies like Humble Bundle who release games DRM-Free for $0.01 (so less than one penny) users, especially on the Linux community, pay up to three times the RRP.

That's fine, that's what Humble Bundle wants to do, and it works within a relatively small subculture. But I maintain it should be *up to content creators* to determine how their products are sold, not some political party that wishes to enforce its preferred model on everyone. But I guess I'm less authoritarian than you. How ironic.

&gt; Generally the only companies that do suffer are the ones like EA that do absolutely no fan service and release what are essentially faulty games (riddled with bugs... and a game you can't get a refund on).

Well there's a straw man argument. Just because a company operates with a crap business model, it doesn't follow that IP and copyright is broken. If a business isn't working it's up to them to address it, not the state. EA is irrelevant to a great many gamers anyway.

&gt; Fun Fact: You're not actually allowed to sing happy birthday without infringing on copyright law

And I don't agree with that. The song was first published in 1893. I believe that copyright should end with the death of the creator(s). While that person is alive they should be free to exploit their creations as they see fit.

Look, I get what you're trying to do. I've read the arguments here and elsewhere, and I know I'm unlikely to change your mind. I also know that piracy will never be stamped out. But please don't try to pretend that imposing a certain content model is for the greater good of society.

We also know that Sterling has some attributes that are useful to us as a striker. We don't know that about Depay. We don't know if he'll adapt to the league and how will he perform in the highest level, and out of his best position. 

Signing him with a view to play him as a striker would be incredibly ignorant of the issues we currently have. He is inexperienced in the highest level, unproven as a striker and far from his peak - that's the complete opposite what we want from a striker. Our first priority has to be signing a proven striker. If we do not do that we should sack everybody involved in our transfer strategies. 

I've got no problems with buying him (or someone similar to him) as a winger who can potentially play as a striker when needed... after we have already brought in a striker.

But spoiled ballots count in the turnout percentage! At first glance, 90% of people would assume that meant 65.1% of people voted for an actual candidate.

To find the figure I had google it and go all the way to here: http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/105896/Plymouth-GE2010-report-web.pdf and then CTRL+F and look for ""spoil"". The figure is 0.28% of votes.

So combined with the 65.1% vote turnout this gives us 0.18% of the *registered voters* voted ""no vote"", and that 64.9% of the *registered voters* voted for an actual candidate.

Either way, the number is very small and makes no difference anyway.

You're right that the media coverage of it is one sided, but the ""government shills"" comment is just silly - and also its fairly clear to see that there is some difference between what each side is doing. 

You'd be better off comparing NATO exercises with Russian exercises, which have taken place regularly in the last couple of years on a massive scale. Its coincided with them invading a country right on the borders of the EU. So, you know, perspective.

And [this](http://www.etoncollege.com/userfiles/files/Eton%20College%20King's%20Scholarship%202003%20examinations%20papers.pdf) paper asks the writer to discuss the quote ""The modern poor are not pitied but written off as trash.

Yeah there's a difference between those two very specific things.

So much this, /u/fonster_mox. I gave my housemate [a fellow rider, still on her CBT] a taste of the XJ6 while in a carpark. She couldn't believe the difference in them. Not just the power - where she only barely got a chance to taste 2nd gear - but how much smoother the ride is. How much more stopping power there is. How much more balance. That even the extra 70+kg is nothing once you get the feel for it.

The only thing that you get from a 125 is more leeway in making mistakes. A 125 is more forgiving with coasting round corners. More forgiving with stopping badly [where you can muscle it back upright].  
But those are still valuable lessons to learn on a big bike. And better to get those out the way with qualified support (:

null,false,Dr-Unk,null,null,null,"I 100% disagree. I'm a final year medical student so maybe I'm biased. I completely acknowledge that my medical school learning and my postgraduate education have and will be subsidised by the government. However, this is also true for many other University courses, should they all have to 'repay' this money? /u/Lanarion is completely correct. It's not like doctors get free training for doing nothing. They are working for the NHS throughout the training process under immense stress and pressure and with ungodly hours. They are literally saving peoples' lives and keeping the country running. This is long before they even get the opportunity to work privately. The cost of training a doctor is more than made up for by the service they provide to the public. 

They also mentioned exam costs. Just as example the MRCGP exam to become a GP will set a trainee back over Â£2000. This is not including the cost of virtually compulsory training courses which are also many 100s to 1000s of pounds. This all comes out of pocket.

Even if you ignore the argument that they are providing a service that more than makes up for the training costs, over the course of a career in medicine a doctor will pay back their training costs and more via tax. This includes doctors who work privately, they're still paying tax aren't they?

The point of doctors moving overseas, many do this at the start of their careers and train overseas so they do not have this cost being picked up by the tax payer. Those who do leave after training have contributed many years to the NHS and have almost certainly provided a much higher value to the UK than the cost of their training. We live in a global market. People from many other careers are free to leave the UK for better employment opportunities elsewhere, why shouldn't doctors? While undoubtedly doctors are paid more than the average worker in the UK they are still very much underpaid compared to other major Western countries. Why is this? This isn't even anything to do with private healthcare vs a national health service. Australia, New Zealand and Canada all pay their doctors more than we do and they all have a health service. If people want to move elsewhere to work under better conditions for more money I think that is completely understandable. Maybe we should put more value on our healthcare professionals in the UK and pay them a competitive salary, this applies for not just doctors but also nurses and all the other allied health professionals. Don't forget, that the reverse also happens, many doctors in the UK immigrated here and were trained overseas.

I really dislike the way you said they shouldn't be allowed to 'benefit from their training'. The public benefits from the training a doctor receives, not just after the training is complete but also during. You imply that the benefit of training to a doctor is to give them the opportunity to make some cash. What about the satisfaction of helping a patient recover or giving a person peace of mind? If a consultant who has worked many years in the NHS wants to make some addictional money that is up to them. They are still providing a service that benefits people enormously.

I should also say that the majority of consulant doctors do no private work. Of those that do the vast vast majority work full time for the NHS, including out of hours, and work privately in their own time. The amount of doctors who have full time private practices is absolutely minute. 

Finally, I don't want to come across like I'm just complaining about the treatment of doctors. I cannot wait to start work in August. I have been studying in University for five years to get the opportunity to get into a hospital and help people. I have no intention at the moment of moving away to work but who knows what the future holds. I think we could and should treat doctors better in the UK and that would solve many of the problems we are having of brain drain and closing GP practices, but it is still in my opinion the most rewarding career possible.

With this kind of logic, the Baltimore and London riots can be justified. Just because this happens to be a peaceful protest by the activists and just because they're not setting things on fire doesn't make it right.

Political violence is still a very real threat, I believe several police officers have been attacked in the past few years in Northern Ireland.

Contrasted with a tasteless advert on the London underground, it makes sense why there would be a unanimous condemnation of one situation over the other. Also, finally, there has been an extremely poor historical precedent set of the mainland trying to impose its values on Ireland.

Any vote for [not Labour] in your constituency is one fewer vote that the Conservatives need to win the seat. 

From what you've said in your post, the issues you care about and your general left-ish slant I think you have to vote for Labour tomorrow. Not because your principles line up perfectly with theirs, but because the alternative is worse. Yes, it's a shitty broken system, but it's the one we have. 

As for the wider points, I am a former member, conference is fun (although can be a bit circle-jerky if you don't get out of your own bubble), some genuine debate and discussion happens, but really your influence is pretty limited unless you put in the work to network your way up the party ranks. Trades union have 50% of the vote, and leadership can and do regularly ignore the wishes of their own members. [The wiki is worth a read](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_Conference).

Labour have abandoned their base. I was okay with the step right to New Labour, to becoming a more centrist party... they have, in my opinion, now stepped even further right, to the point where I'm not even sure they're still a party of the left. Page 2 of this year's manifesto accepts wholeheartedly the Conservative position that debt and deficit are the most important matters to be dealt with. That troubles me in many many ways. 

Ultimately if you want to join a party, join the one that most aligns with your world view - and if the anti-science positions of the Greens put you off, argue against them at conference and within the party. Likewise if you agree with *most* of Labour's positions but want them focussed on climate change more, argue for that with whomever you can within the party... 

But tomorrow you aren't dealing with lofty ideals, you're dealing with casting one vote for your constituency MP, and in your specific case that is a choice between Labour and the Tories. 

FWIW I live in a Lib/Con marginal (which is going to go con tomorrow), I couldn't justify a vote for Labour here on the same grounds, even if I was still a member and did still believe in the party.

So yes we are playing Ipswich. It's deemed a slight advantage to have the home leg second so the 'superior' team gets that.

The leg system just means that the goals scored for both teams are totted up over the two legs and is treated like a normal score - the team with the more goals over the two legs is the winner.

But what if there is a draw? This is where the home advantage comes in. The league play-offs don't have an away-goals rule (where the team that scored more away goals across the two legs is deemed the winner in case of a draw). Instead there is standard extra-time at the end of the second leg. If they're still tied after extra time of course it goes to penalties. The extra time and penalties being at your ground could give you a significant advantage, so this is why you try and finish as high in the table as possible.

I'm not a big fan of the Labour party but he's started to sway me, not quite enough to convince me to vote Labour, but I wouldn't be too miffed to see him in Number 10.

One thing that does bug me is his refusal to consider coalition. I admire Nick Clegg's point he made in the ITV debate that he would never apologise for putting the good of the country above the good of his party, even if it came at a short-term political cost. They (mostly) did they best they could to deliver their promises by forming a stronger government with the democratically elected party in 2010 (I mostly agree that Lib/Lab coalition would've been illegitimate, though I wouldn't mind seeing it if Labour get more seats this time round).

Milliband says he'd rather not be in power at all, than not be able to deliver *all* of his manifesto in a coalition. Sometimes politics is the art of compromise. To refuse to do any is somewhat dangerous, that's what makes the US Congress so inept at doing anything.

Another thing I've noticed in the debates and conferences though is how Miliband overuses the phrase ""let me answer you directly"", which I find a little patronising, and a bit of a cheap PR trick.

That aside, I think he's led a pretty good campaign. I'd rather more of his party were like him, and less like the previous Labour government.

And the second is, I think, a conflation of the UKIP / anti-immigrant platform and the legitimate need for England to develop its youth so that it is competitive in international matches.

&gt;

&gt;__Argument from authority__, also __authoritative argument__ and __appeal to authority__, is a common form of argument which leads to a [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) when misused. 

&gt;In informal reasoning, the appeal to authority is a form of argument attempting to establish a [statistical syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_syllogism).  The appeal to authority relies on an argument of the form: 

&gt;&gt;A is an authority on a particular topic

null,false,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,null,"&gt; A proportion of long-term unemployed/underemployed lack basic skills, which makes them essentially unemployable. A number of these people lack the motivation to learn these skills.

A large chunk of the schemes that would train people in to the skills a new career would need are either age locked (18 - 15), only available in certain regions or only available to those in receipt of specific benefits. 

Perfect example:  Wheels to Work, a scheme aimed at getting the unemployed driving (driving lessons are expensive, not everyone's parents could afford to fund them when the person turned 17, etc,) and operated in Hampshire.  Except the borough of Havant and only for the 18 - 25 year olds. 

Another example:  Careers advice in my area is restricted to either people on ESA or 18 - 25 year olds on JSA.  So if you're over 25 and on JSA but in need of some advice... tough tit. 

It also has to be remembered that businesses only need a certain number of people that only have these basic skills and nothing else, simply training everyone to this level and saying ""Get a job"" helps the first wave... but the second, third and fourth waves run in to the exact same problem.  Not only that but schemes that do this tend to run for many years past their point of being useful to local industry.  To my mind the basic skills a business would need is covered by things like the ECDL training... that's been running for over a decade at this point, it's no longer really useful in most of the areas it's offered in.

So it's not necessarily a lack of motivation on the part of the unemployed to gain skills, they might be the most willing and motivated person you'd hope for but the local services don't offer anything they (or businesses that person can commute to) need or fall outside of the catchment criteria.

&gt; The nature of industry now means that the amount of jobs available for people who have basic skills but no specialised skills are falling fast.

Exactly.  We don't need ditch diggers or typists in any great numbers.  We need JCB operators, Personal Assistants but in greatly reduced numbers.  The problem is the system is still pushing people towards being a typist or ditch digger and once they've finished training to be such we yell at them when they struggle to find work.  We need to take a look at each area of this country (county by county, borough by borough) and figure out what is needed in that area and tailor the training packages we offer via the DWP to match it.  We're long past one size fits all being worth while.

While it might undermine my original point a little bit, using that question in the way you did is meaningless unless you know exactly how they being examined. Many of the questions are politically loaded; could a boy giving too many answers that are not in-line with how the school expects students to think lead to him being denied entry?

For example, I read the question you refer to as a provocation for the boys to defend the twentieth century economy (i.e. beggars are not treated as trash). Would a response with criticism of it count against their performance?

Of course that is conjecture, but like I said, many questions do seem politically loaded. Unless the college are very transparent about how the papers are marked, you can't dismiss the idea that students are at least partly being judged on the poltical ideas they bring to their responses. 

Also, you say 60% of Eton students are studying through scholarship. [This](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/13/eton-old-boys-network-flourishes) article states that ""Eton subsidises the fees of about 20% of its pupils"". That means 80% of students are indeed there because they come from wealthy backgrounds.

With regards to the examples of alumni you refer to, were they scholars from poor backgrounds? No. Bear Grylls, for instance, was the son of Sir and Lady Grylls. 

So while it doesn't always directly relate to politics, it seems to me that Eton perpetuates a system where the wealthy maintain a disproportionate level of influence and privilege at the higher ends of society.

As this amount of money is larger than what Scotland contributes to the UK that money has to come from somewhere, since Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved powers protecting them from budget cuts to give more money to Scotland the easiest place for Westminster to find that money is in England. 

I have no doubt that while promoting Scottish interests in the future the SNP will need more money. Want to improve NHS Scotland? Let's ask Westminster for more money, want to improve Scottish schools? Again let's ask Westminster for more money and in the circumstances where the government is relying on the SNP the Westminster government will have to cave in order to keep their support.

null,false,solo___dolo,null,null,null,"**Hypothetical Case:** If I was given a voucher or a crystal clear allowance for a Â£400 meal spend from the dealership for whatever restaurant I wanted to eat at, then you bet I wouldn't head to Burger King. You don't owe the dealership anything in this case. They have given you a clear limit to what they are more than happy to pay for so as to ensure you are compensated for their mistake and grievance caused with your car troubles. In this case, the spending limit would have been derived from a calculated business process made by a high-end car manufacturer's dealership, and you would not be exploiting them in any way by using what they have given you. They aren't your friends, they are a business that is tasked with serving you after you have paid a fortune for their products and services. In that specific hypothetical case, I would have no qualms in spending all of the limit or the lion's share of it.

**Actual Case:** However, in the actual real-life case, no spending limit was set, which can only be put down as careless business practice by the dealership manager. Everyone who has ever worked in a customer/client facing role knows that you cannot afford to assume anything and that decision has come back to bite. You have to cover all bases and have correct policy in place as a matter of course to ensure the business is not taken advantage of.

While it can be seen as highly exploitative and aggressively opportunistic of the customer to spend that much money on a meal without having received any spending instruction, by letter of the agreement, she has actually done nothing wrong. We have to remember the context also - this is someone who has just spent Â£20,000 on a car, so this is someone who it would be fairly logical to assume has relatively high degree of disposable income compared to the average person. She may be used to eating in quality restaurants and usually spending amounts of money which could be interpreted as excessive by the average Joe. So the relative degree of excessive spending could be considered less dramatic from her perspective. 

*In the process of writing this response I have changed my stance on my original comment above, in which I said the customer is objectively 'exploitative'. This is only an interpretation and cannot be proven. Having explored the possibilities and taken the context into account, the customer's apparent lack of ethical behaviour can be seen as less dramatic. The only provable wrongdoing is that of the dealership failing to specify contractual terms.*",null,0,null,1430921013,null,0,1430921232,0,cr07jdi,null,t3_351wdp,null,t1_cr07jdi,null,t1_cr06gkl,null,null,null,1432803569,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

I'm not sure that *bad person* is intrinsically a worse insult than *stupid person*. In fact you could argue the former at least lends the credibility of intelligence to the person you're attacking.

As far as labeling people *evil* is concerned, neither the [left](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/23/guardian-profile-lynton-crosby) nor [right](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html) claim a monopoly on that. 

Personally, I don't think David Cameron is *evil*. Honestly I think it's a bit silly to call anyone evil in the 21st century. But no, I don't think he's a *very nice person* and I come to that conclusion by judging him against my personal priorities for what makes a ""good person"" (e.g. compassion &amp; support for those less fortunate than himself). I'm sure in return he would consider me a *stupid or naive person* because I don't consider *other things* more important (e.g. individualism, business). 

The bad vs. wrong dichotomy you describe is a direct result of this thinking: a person who is *caring* will see someone who is *not caring* as *bad*, a person who is *practical* will see someone who is *not practical* as *wrong/stupid*. There is no intrinsic moral position on impracticality, vs. uncaring, hence the apparent value loading from the left side only.

The ideal solution of course is a *bit of both*, but we can't reach that if people are throwing around terms live *evil*, which I absolutely don't.

This isn't entirely true. James Rodriguez was hyped up because of the WC and he is doing extremely well for RM. Depay did really well for his country and he is proving to be a great player. Toni Kroos did really well in the WC and he is doing the same at RM also. 

&gt;I'd rather give this job to our scouts, if they exist.

Why do you think we are scouting Depay? He is proving he can play striker, he isn't glued to being a winger for the rest of his life. Sturridge was a RW when he was at Chelsea, when he came to us, he proved he can play as a Striker and has done so since. So why can't Depay do the same. Vietto would be a great choice and even better since i believe he has a 15m euro release clause and with the season he's had, he would be a steal. I doubt Lacazette would come, Dybala said he wants to stay in Italy, Icardi is a possibility, but other than those guys, i can't see anyone else coming to us.  Sanchez failed because he was offered more at Arsenal than us. I don't know about Remy since i don't watch him. Eto'o getting up in age and Balo i would like to see here next season to give him another chance instead of judging him on his first season.

Not just the circumstances of his birth change, but his 3rd regeneration no longer takes place on the planet of the spiders and his eye color flicks between green and blue (sometimes from page to page).   

The chameleon arc doesn't make sense as 8 didn't have any access to his belongings, in fact it raises more plot holes then it solves. The books managed to solve it in a way that would allow them to work with any future version of the show's ideas.

Michael Wharton has accused her of an excessive pursuit of political correctness: ""At 3.6 degrees on the Alibhai-Brown scale, it sets off a shrill scream that will not stop until youâve pulled yourself together with a well-chosen anti-racist slogan.""[27]
&gt;
&gt;Stephen Pollard accused her of racism while calling her opinions ""utterly vile"" in The Jewish Chronicle in June 2008.[28] In October 2009, Luciana Berger, then director of Labour Friends of Israel, criticised Alibhai-Brown for writing in her column: ""All three parties were lavishly entertained by the over-influential Friends of Israel."" Berger said that Alibhai-Brown had not attended the LFI event or provided any evidence to sustain her comment. Berger insisted the hospitality (""house wine or orange juice and chips. Crisps and peanuts if you got to a bowl in time"") was not lavish.[29]
&gt;
&gt;On 25 August 2008, she appeared on Channel 5's The Wright Stuff television discussion programme. In a discussion about an employment issue relating to white men, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown joked: ""Take his advice. Don't apply. It would be great if you lot just went away; white, middle class men. We'd just walk in wouldn't we."" When challenged by the host for the day, Richard Bacon, ""Is that not a racist comment?"" she replied: ""Of course"".[30]
&gt;
&gt;Commentator Douglas Murray accused her of disregarding the lives of British soldiers killed in action: ""The vindication of her own opinion is of more importance to her than the lives of British and American troops and Iraqi civilians.""[31]

According to the chart, if OP sticks this money in mutual funds now, and does nothing else, then by the time he's 65 he'll have Â£602,070 (the grey line, Susan's narrative). Were he to withdraw that at Â£20,000 per year from then on, it'd last him until he's 95, but that's not counting returns after he starts withdrawing.

You'll have to do the maths for yourself, but I think you'll find that owning a house is more expensive than your guesstimates.

null,false,Colonel_Blimp,null,null,null,"&gt; Yeah there's a difference between those two very specific things. But if you take into account the historical and material conditions in which these events take place, it become pretty obvious that NATO is aggressively trying to control territory as close to Russia as possible, and that Russia's actions are reactions rather than provocation. Or as some of the media would like us to believe, Russian imperialism. The same media that conveniently far less critical of Western imperialism (hooray we liberated Libya, amirite?)

...or, its more complicated than that and while NATO expansion has got very close to Russia (sometimes daring to include nations which Russia had dictated to for half a century, the bastards), Putin has consolidated pretty undemocratic control over the Russian state, has allowed oligarchs to thrive as long as they're friends with him and then has gone on to militarily intimidate his neighbours - and occupy a big portion of one when it has the gall to move closer to the EU. The foreign policy of NATO countries towards Russia has been flawed since the end of the Cold War but don't give me this ""Russia is just defending itself against big bad NATO"" crap, and its hilarious that you're coming out with this after complaining about NATO bias.

Libya was a genuine humanitarian emergency where a regime that was about to slaughter basically all of its opposition was overturned by NATO intervention. We then fucked up by leaving Libya to its own devices afterwards, but it was better than letting the government continue. Of course, Russia had no problem with Libya because it was a traditionally aligned allied dictatorship, just like Syria. I'm happy to admit Western countries have had the same relationship with some (Saudi's being the worst example) but you're barking up one side of the tree here I think.

Sorry if I didn't pick up on the shills thing, when you've seen it used seriously enough...

&gt; This is exactly the kind of pro NATO bias I am talking about. When the West supported right wing protesters and helped overthrow the democratically elected government: ""Ukrainians overthrow corrupt government, hooray!"" 

Dismissing the movement against the previous government as entirely right wing is ridiculous. Also, saying they overthrew a democratic government when its ""democratic"" leader tried to remove opposition undemocratically on a regular basis, and was basically impeached by a vast majority of the government after he used very excessive violence against popular protest? Hmmm. This isn't just a case of ""NATO bias"", you're pretty clearly swung onto one side of the argument. Do you watch RT?

&gt; When Russia supports rebels who defend themselves against fascists paramilitaries. ""Russia is invading Europe, boo!""

Yeah because that's the only thing that's happening. ""Fascist paramilitaries"" make up a minority of primarily volunteer forces loyal to the new regime in Kiev. The Russian rebels *started the military confrontation by seizing swathes of the country by force*. Russia hasn't just ""supported"" these rebels casually, it has genuinely invaded Ukraine on a regular basis whenever the Ukrainian's have made an advance to restore the stalemate or help rebels make small gains. Its also occupied Crimea without proportional provocation  and then likely rigged a referendum on its membership of Ukraine and aggressively censored any resistance. (Which is overkill anyway because they could've got a majority vote in favour of becoming part of Russia without doing so, but do you really think Putin cares about that?)

Please don't paint yourself as just seeing through the NATO bias and being more objective when you're regurgitating the sort of contrarian crap that Russian state and media has been flooding on to the internet and RT in the West for god knows how long.

Don't mistake my view. There is 100% for sure men haters (both male and female) who have latched onto feminism with small enclaves and pollute it with disgusting rubbish. But that doesn't change the overall and overwhelming number of moderate, thoughtful group who are just intent on making things better for people.

&gt;Or would you just claim that they don't represent true-feminism?

Nice attempt to shut down a somewhat valid point. Minorities don't speak for a majority, and you'd be hard pushed to find a non-fringe feminist that wouldn't criticise the hatred spewed by these clearly problem suffering individuals.

I wouldn't go anywhere close to using ""true"" feminism myself. There is no true feminism, since there are many clashing ideas on how to proceed with improving things. The only actual goal of anyone claiming to be a feminist should be that desire to make society better.

Sensationalism is a powerful tool. It's easy to pick out a terrible message amongst the millions of well meaning ones and state: ""LOOK! THIS IS THE TRUE FACE OF THIS MOVEMENT"" and ignore the entire overall message. But what's important is that you look at the rest of what's being pursued by the entire movement.

That last part is something we can all be better at and something we all fail to do regularly. It's just how we are wired; to read the shock title and assume the worst. It's why clickbait titles work so effectively on the web and how tabloids sell us with their front pages.

That's probably a good analogy about it all actually. It's like being at a newspaper stand and only paying attention to the red top with emblazoned uppercase title:

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour Member,null,"Well, I'm going to break rank here. Sorry, everyone.

I don't believe in tactical voting. You should always vote for the party which best aligns with your beliefs for (at least) two reasons:

* The long-term: Your vote doesn't only count at this election: It points the way to the future. If Labour keep losing votes to the Greens, for example, they'll move in the Green's direction.
* FPTP is a broken system. Voting for the party you believe in -- rather than abstaining or voting tactically -- shows up exactly how broken it is and increases the pressure to fix it.

As a minor, third, reason, it's not your fault if the 'good' party doesn't get elected: It's *their* fault for not doing enough to win your vote.

Now, let me tell you why you should vote Labour anyway.

The Greens are not and cannot be a credible political party because they lack a proper social base: They're an environmental pressure group that runs for Parliament. Labour, by contrast, is not a set of vaguely 'Labourish' policies: They're the political arm of an actual movement, rooted in the real experiences of the people they represent. This is the reason that Labour has always (not just since Blair -- ask Miliband's dad) disappointed people looking to implement 'real socialism': We don't care about intellectual purity; we care about working people. We cock up, sometimes, because we're human, but we're always aiming for the common good.

That's why the fact that Labour is a part of the political establishment is a strength, not a weakness. Yes, it means compromise, and even, sometimes, corruption. But it also means that the voice of working people is part of the establishment. That's important. Before Labour, our voice was not part of the establishment, it was outside it, like the Greens are (arguably) now. We built the NHS by being part of the establishment; we introduced a minimum wage by being part of the establishment; we'll freeze energy prices by being part of the establishment.

The alternative to being part of the establishment is standing outside the establishment and shouting at it. To me, that isn't enough.

Some of what you describe as your politics requires a cultural shift, rather than a political one (a government can judge itself on something other than GDP growth, but if everyone else is looking at GDP, it won't get anywhere!). There's no clear way of achieving a cultural shift. However, Labour right now are saying that GDP growth isn't enough, that we need good jobs and better pay, too. Electing a party arguing for that might be part of that shift.

Now, regarding climate change: You might know Miliband was Climate Change Secretary. He helped get the Copenhagen agreement through the UN, which was a big deal. Yes, Copenhagen didn't go far enough, but if it hadn't been passed at all, I think we can agree that would've been worse. Our leader has a good track record on climate change, and I think that's a reason to believe he'll maintain that record once he's in power.

One of the disadvantages of being an establishment party is that you have to campaign on the issues that people care about, not on niche interests. While I agree with you that climate change is the biggest issue facing the world -- and many in the party, including Ed, do too -- if people don't raise it as a big issue, the way they do with the NHS and immigration, talking about it a lot is crazy. We'd be seen as ignoring the things people actually care about and voters would turn away as a result. It's not pretty, but it's politics.

Regarding the problem of corruption of various kinds in politicians: This is a problem, and we should do more to stop MPs sitting on boards and that kind of thing (Labour will ban second jobs for MPs, which will help achieve this). I have two things to say in response to your point regarding what MPs do after they retire, though. First, there's absolutely no reason to think Green MPs wouldn't do the exact same thing. None. Second, what are MPs supposed to do when they leave the Commons? Write their memoirs and do nothing for years? Become bus drivers? No, they're going to do something commensurate with their level of experience: They're going to end up running things, and some of them will run businesses. I think we could help deal with the 'special interest' problem by making them take 'gardening leave' -- six months or so after they leave the Commons where they can't take another job, maybe longer for ministers. But whatever. Again, this is a problem that all political parties will have, however pure their intentions.

Labour members' voices are heard, yes, and the more of us there are, the more they'll listen. We can change our party, and the world. The mobility of capital and finance doesn't stop us building good schools and hospitals, or even having a state industrial policy (China has one!). You shouldn't expect to join a party and have everyone immediately listen to you but we do get things done by pressing on the issues we care about. Labour will never implement every policy its members want and nor will any party. Government's tricky. But Labour can be a good party, a good government, that's responsive to the needs of its members and the people. And that's why you should join us, because with every new member, we get a new voice pulling us in the right direction.",null,0,null,1430923247,null,0,false,0,cr08s35,null,t3_351nq7,null,t1_cr08s35,null,t3_351nq7,null,null,null,1432804155,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

Last August, my father had a detached retina.  It detached again in November, so he had more surgery and then needed a 2nd followup appointment 6 weeks after the surgery, so sometime at the beginning of January.  He was given an appointment in July.  No joke, no mistake, July - and apparently there was nothing that could be done about it.  No amount of pleading with the hospital appointment team or the consultants secretary could change that.

His consultant does private work so being concerned and fairly desperate to see him before July he made an appointment to see him at the beginning of January for the followup.  The consultant was absolutely furious - my father had oil in his eye and that can't just carry on sitting there for months on end, it can be dangerous after a while.

While we were sat in his consulting room, (which was the same room in which he does his NHS work) he discharged my dad from his private care and booked him in for his next operation in February, on the NHS.  He explained that he wasn't really allowed to do it but he was so angry in the way my dad had been treated by the hospital, he felt justified.

He had more surgery in February, followed by more surgery 2 weeks ago. My father has been nearly blind for 8 months now, and still can't see properly yet, but hopefully after a few more weeks, things should start to return to normal.

Anyway, my point really is that if this consultant hadn't done private work, we'd never have got to see him and with the oil left in his eye, who knows how much damage could have been done.  Luckily he could afford to pay his fee (50% of which this consultant donates to a local eye charity, as well as another charity that funds eye operations in Africa) and he was able to see the consultant at the right time. 

 I feel incredibly sorry for people who aren't that lucky.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"I'd like to expand on a couple of points /u/strolls makes. First of all renting has some of the same costs of home ownerships already factored into the rent. Secondly that index funds are 'secure' investments although I think this is more of a semantics mistake. Secure investments would be something like bonds. Index funds on the other hand reduce volatility and risk by diversifying their assets. They are admirable investments which can, and arguably should, form the vanguard of any investment portfolio but I wouldn't call them secure per se.

That said I agree that home ownership can be an impediment to your future desires although this depends greatly on both what you think your future desires are now but and also what they turn out to be in the future.

As for whether index funds could do support the cost of indefinite renting the answer is a definitive 'maybe'. Ultimately it depends on how much you can invest as a renter compared to how much you would have spent as a home owner. Ideally you want to look for an area where renting has a *significant* discount on the cost of ownership so that you can invest as much as possible. Unfortunately some places, including certain areas of York, are comparatively more expensive to rent compared to ownership in which case this method would not work.

In the limited number of cases I have looked at (i.e. where I have found comparable rent vs buy values looking at current rental prices and recent house price data) where the strategy is viable it takes 25+ years for the investment to grow to the point where it can sustain the cost of renting whereas 25 years after paying a mortgage you should only have upkeep costs left. That said I've used some pretty basic numbers &amp; calculations - there are other non-financial factors to take into account on both sides of the argument.

Benteke's record is great, but we've had players come from smaller premier league clubs before who have had great records. Downing was Villa's prize possession when we got him, Enrique was Newcastle's POTY the year we signed him, Lovren had a good season at Saints and Borini netted 13 for Sunderland last year. It doesn't mean Benteke can fit into Rodgers' system or live up to the expectations of the club. 

To me, absolutely everything about Benteke is what we should avoid in a striker. His ability to run in behind defenders is non-existent, I don't know the exact statistic but his offside per games record is among the worst in the league. His hold up play is pretty mediocre too, if we're looking to play a fluid passing game, having a target man is going to make all our play far more predictable. I'm certain that Benteke wouldn't reach double figures for us next season, if he does, I'll buy a shirt with his name on for the 16/17 season.",null,0,null,1430924779,null,0,false,0,cr09okd,null,t3_351xao,null,t1_cr09okd,null,t1_cr082sn,null,null,null,1432804650,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

You rank the candidates in order of preference, and if any candidate has (100/number of seats in constituency) percent of the vote, they get a seat (and any 'extra' votes are sent to 2nd choices based on the preferences of everyone who voted for them). If no candidate manages to get over the threshold, the party with the smallest number of votes is eliminated, and their votes go to the second choices. Then you check if someone is over the threshold, and if not, you eliminate the next lowest and so on.  Independents are treated just like everyone else.

Parachuting candidates in is actually harder with STV, as in, say a 9 member constituency like Norfolk, each major party would put up 9 candidates. So if a candidate was seen as being parachuted in, they'd be 9th choice for their party's voters, and wouldn't be elected unless the party got a huge (90% plus) portion of the vote.

* go see Housing Services at the uni

Always try the official Housing Services at the uni first. I think they're called Living. They have a web site www.Birminghamstudentpad.co.uk which they use to advertise private sector housing. To advertise all the landlords have to be accredited by a council scheme. It's not perfect but it's a start.

They can also give you advice on where to look and what to be weary off. Also you can go to them if you have issues one you get into a house and they will handle the complaint for you.

In terms of letting agents stay away from Britannia, easy lettings and unipads (I think that's what they call themselves now, they've had to change their names so often - but they re on the corner of North rd opposite the soak) Anyway crooks, all of them.

I've known Britannia to offer you a room, pay the deposit then give the room to someone else. They like doing this to international students a lot. Then safety care and repairs once in are atrocious. In fact they've just been done by the council for illegally converting 2 bed terrace houses in to 6 bed self contained flats. With no planning permission.

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt; The same paper has an extended question about the justification of war, as well as talking about the moral basis of torture, and whether pacifists should be considered cowards.

These are entirely open-ended questions. To lead the boys into saying war is necessary, torture is morally sound or pacifism is cowardice is to invalidate the purpose of testing them. The college doesn't solely admit students that believe in war or torture or conscription, the very idea of that is complete nonsense and an indication of how warped your view of Eton is.

&gt;For example, I read the question you refer to as a provocation for the boys to defend the twentieth century economy (i.e. beggars are not treated as trash). Would a response with criticism of it count against their performance?

It wouldn't. The essays are marked on how the student is able to explain and support their answer, whatever it may be. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the thought of Eton only admitting warlike boys and stamping them into blue-tie politicians is complete nonsense. People who go to Eton simply tend to end up at the top of their game, just as people who go to top universities do. Other British schools ought to take a leaf out of Eton's book.

&gt;Also, you say 60% of Eton students are studying through scholarship. This[1] article states that ""Eton subsidises the fees of about 20% of its pupils"".

That article also describes left-wing old Etonians as 'prickly dissenters'. Given that Eton's mock student elections usually have about a 30% vote for Labour, I think we can safely put that article into the trash.

&gt;With regards to the examples of alumni you refer to, were they scholars from poor backgrounds? No. Bear Grylls, for instance, was the son of Sir and Lady Grylls.

They weren't examples of that, they were examples of famous old Etonians who didn't go into politics. The school does no more pushing its pupils into politics than any other school does, Eton just has a better platform and doesn't put limits on what its students can achieve.

&gt;So while it doesn't always directly relate to politics, it seems to me that Eton perpetuates a system where the wealthy maintain a disproportionate level of influence and privilege at the higher ends of society.

Eton doesn't perpetuate that in the slightest, it just turns out that if people for whom money is no object will send their children to the best possible private school.

Bone is stronger than steel. and this article refers to average human beings. someone like kolo, who has been taking knocks to his legs has calcification throughout all of the ones in his body due to constant kicking and hacking at his legs. in addition, his muscles are so strong, his bones and ligaments generally are pretty well protected by the muscle in situations that would render themselves dangerous for average people. I would venture to say that kolo can squat somewhere between 350-450 lbs, can deadlift 300 lbs and he can run 2 miles in 10 minutes, making it very hard for his muscles to fail in that situation. Also, do you even know how much resistance is on the machine? for all we know, it could be nothing. so before you talk to me about argumentative fallacies and how dangerous this is, how about you think twice and just stfu...

This year has very much been a 'blooding' of the next generation. We have the youngest squad in the Premier League (don't say BPL, people will hate you for it) and the future is very, very bright

It's been a difficult year but overall a good one. We signed Eric Dier, a 21 year old centre-back who has been very promising; Federico Fazio, an older, more experienced centre-back who has been okay-ish, Ben Davies, also a young defender who's been very promising and Benji Stambouli, a young midfielder who's been unfortunate because some of our youth players have come through in his position and been outstanding (Nabil Bentaleb, Ryan Mason).

We also signed Michel Vorm, a backup goalkeeper.

In general, it's been a good year - it was always going to be difficult, and very few of us thought we'd actually reach the top 4 this season. Nonetheless, we made it to a cup final and are now thereabouts in 5th place. So we've not regressed, but we've not really progressed either.

This summer, and next season, are very very important. Pochettino is building a new team, which takes time, and they're very young. The signings we make in the summer and the way we perform next season - when we'll be hoping to progress, and challenge for the Top 4 again - will be huge.

Not with Clegg as leader. Peelites/Orange Bookers etc. I guess not impossible but not as comfortable on economic matters. 

&gt; I know it would go against political etiquette to form a coalition with the party that didn't win the most votes

Not only would it go against etiquette, but it would be deeply unpopular. Just imagine the headlines. 

&gt; They did have power, Clegg just relinquished it when he rolled over as easily as he did.

I agree he made a trade off. What people typically don't see is what was received in other areas. Let's also not forget that regarding tuition fees there were Conservative backbenchers pushing for there to be no cap on them at all. 

&gt; I don't think the government has done enough to promote political education

I'm not so sure how far the government should or can promote proper political education. I think they should encourage people to learn for themselves but it's impossible to have them providing the information as it would be a massive conflict of interest. 

&gt; and jargon as at least a semi-deliberate ploy aimed at keeping political knowledge away from the majority of the working class

This is very true in our day in age, at least according to a (rather persuasive) [Weberian analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICppFQ6Tabw)

However, I still think the people here have a duty to try and keep up themselves. The trouble is that it's next to impossible, even for experts to be fully aware of issues across the immense complexities of the modern state, not to mention its sheer size. It's a bit of a paradox I suppose. 

&gt; What I am suggesting is that contradictory policies like Â£80odd billion of austerity cuts while pumping billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing, the majority of which money went directly to the rich

The cuts made the stimulus possible in the balance sheet context. Also, they voted for these representatives in the first place, so you can't really have it both ways. By voting, one is delegating these decisions to the state.

I think part of it is that people wouldn't fully understand (even the experts disagree and get it wrong!). The trouble with full disclosure is that it's just not practicable given how the media and the public would or could respond. It would make aspects of governance even harder than they already are because most people don't have the education (or the will) to understand or take the time it would take to properly be in a position where you could understand enough about the decision. Ultimately people believe whatever they want to believe -- like religion. 

Further, if you put all cards on the table, people would switch off and get bored. It would be too technical, and they could just complain about tactful/deceitful use of jargon etc. 

&gt; morality has left politics

I wholeheartedly disagree. I think what we're witnessing is that a new moral order has supplanted other ideologies. It might not fit your own personal views in every conceivable way, but I'm sure there is also some good to be found in it. 

&gt; All they know is, they're not being represented well enough. 

What's interesting is that they don't really know. I think they're being told they aren't being properly represented by other groups interested in power, and interested in advocating their own sense of morality (nothing wrong with this of course, it just is). And I think 'the status quo' is a concept made up for political purposes -- there's no such thing as the status quo; things are always changing, now more quickly than ever. It's really just a short cut for those who feel (whether actually or simply because they have been told they should be) disaffected to press their case. 

As a centrist it's these sorts of dichotomies that get on my nerves, but it can often be hard to explain because like with the Lib Dems, people easily confuse a flexible, pragmatic realism, with spinelessness and lack of fixed principles. Really the fixed principle is in trying to find bipartisan solutions to complex problems often simplified into restraining, polarized dichotomies. 

I think we're all biased, which is important to bear in mind regardless of which 'side' one lands on. But thank you as well for the interesting and frank discussion. Disagreement, open discussion and a willingness to internalise another's position is very much what is needed as there is always room for learning and development in everyone.

This is extremely easy for me to write, because I have the benefit of careless experience - it's easy to say ""I'll worry about the future later"", but now I'm a good chunk closer to infirmity than you are, and I have nothing to show for it.

It is common to think of rent as throwing money away, but in fact it is money you are exchanging for a service, and you're allowed to spend your money whatever way you like. The cashflow of your life is a continual river of money flowing in and money flowing out, and it's probably wisest to make decisions based on actual numbers, not feelings.

If you're buying a Â£200,000 house, then you could well end up paying the bank Â£400,000 for the privilege of owning that property. Try changing the interest rate on [this page](https://www.google.co.uk/compare/mortgage/qs?gclid=CMqc1JynrcUCFWvKtAodiRMA2w#!profile=DEFAULT&amp;profile=DEFAULT&amp;purpose&amp;tab=calculator&amp;totalMortgage=200000&amp;repaymentsType=CAPITAL_AND_INTEREST&amp;term=30) to 5% and the term to 30 years. Sorry that I can't figure out how to provide a direct link, but it's easily credible that interest rates will hit 6% or 7% at some points during the next 2 or 3 decades. 

It may well be that the best thing for you is to buy a house - I think that, at least, there would be a *solidity* to that, and it's an investment that you can wrap your head around - but IMO your biggest problem is that you don't have a plan, and I suspect you don't have a budget.

IMO your biggest problem is that (from the sounds of it) you're not saving any of your wages, and you're not tracking your outgoings tightly enough. That is fundamentally why you're worrying about this money trickling away - if you had your monthly household budget in a spreadsheet, then you'd be able enjoy the satisfaction that your incomings are exceeding your outgoings. You'd be able to look at the chart and think ""nothing to worry about there"".

If you care about your longterm financial future (again, easy for me to write, because I never have), you would plan to save a fixed amount from your salary every month.

Whilst you're supporting your fiancÃ©e, you should be economising - cutting down on your social life, taking public transport instead of a taxi, buying the cheap shite at Tesco, not taking driving lessons, cancelling Sky &amp;/or Netflix - so you can ensure your outgoings continue to respect your income, and you can continue to stash at least some part of your wages in savings each month.

If you're anything like me, then your life has always been *money in, money out*, and this is the first time you've had a reservoir to maintain. IMO the first thing you need to change is your *attitude to money* (or your *relationship with money*, if you prefer) - once you have that under control, what to do with this lump sum will fall into place and you will wonder why you worried about it.

IMO you need to get your fiancÃ©e on board with your budgeting and investing - if she's genuinely part of your future, then the two of you need to make commitments about where you want to be when you're 50. No plan survives contact with the enemy, but if you have one in place then you know where you'll be falling back to when contingencies strike.

Financially, I am one of Jim Henson's creations - I am just some dude like yourself who's spent the last few weeks or months subscribed to this subreddit and trying to learn stuff from it.

It's been historically recorded that, as you said, members of the city of Blackpool were born with or spontaneously sprouted three hands and two heads, but a lesser known fact is that the most common mutation results in the second head being attached to the patella, and the extra hand is attached to said head's forehead. Naturally, as a mutation, several conditions arise, the first (and foremost) being that the brainless knee-head merely sags on the chitinous tendons, open mouthed and blank eyed, whilst the spare hand, still containing nerves, twitches in the breeze. 

This is, incidentally, how the L gesture over the forehead came about; throughout the late 13th century the town had reputation for being able to cure or alleviate symptoms of most diseases such as Scoliosis and other skeletal problems. As such, it became a hotspot for con-artists such as Monseur RenÃ© Sonse, a French ~~bastard~~ womaniser from Lower East Brittany, who, after failing to cure the man of his second head (it is also well know that he slept with the man's wife: ""this is fer tuppin' my wyfe ye ballarag wastrel"" (*Medieval and Early Renaissance Sex Record of Blackpool,* 2013)) was forced, at the point of a flintlock, to cram the Innkeeper's knee-head's hand up his own bottom. 

Being a gentleman, he obliged the Innkeeper, but instead of stopping at merely the hand, as custom dictated then, Monsieur Sonse continued, and subsumed the entire head. He took his dagger and cut the cartilage holding it to the Innkeeper's knee, and hopped off into the night, proclaiming that the deal was done. The Innkeeper's wife fled into the night with Sonse, leaving the Innkeeper to die in the dust, the cuckold that he was. 

But the Innkeeper lived.

And to satisfy his need for revenge, he tracked down Monsieur Sonse to a small hamlet called Burleigh-by-the-Barley, where he lived as the town pharmacist. The Innkeeper waited, and crept into his room at night with the knife that had so wounded him, and cut Sonse from his P to his A to retrieve the head, the hand of which, as legend tells, was pointing upwards in an L shape. ""Losere..."" muttered Sonse, and, on understanding the hand was pointing to heaven, and thus signifying Sonse's divinity, the Innkeeper sank to his knees and prayed for forgiveness. Sonse stood up on the bed, penis halved like a peanut shell, and smiled. ""Thou hath passeth mine test, my son"" he said, and a heavenly light fell upon them, for he, and he alone, had pursued his ~~property~~ wife to win her back at all costs, without committing murder. Sonse cured the man and his family once and for all, but damned Blackpool.

The creativity of Sonse's insult led Victorian scholars to believe that this is the first recorded instance of the moving away from scatalogical humour of the medieval period, transcending it with a symbolic, forward thinking gesture, ushering England into a new Enlightenment of wonder and intelligence, and thus, the term Renaissance was coined.",null,0,null,1430927722,null,0,1430928110,0,cr0bibg,null,t3_351poa,null,t1_cr0bibg,null,t1_cr07acj,null,null,null,1432805511,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Politics is too complicated to reduce with any real accuracy - you can only observe trends and hope for the best.  
  
Your point about there being no intrinsic moral position on impracticality is interesting but I see you as drawing the wrong conclusion. The value loading is not ""apparent"": it is fundamental to how the discourse is being held and we cannot escape that there is a difference in how anybody would percieve someone if they were described as ""bad"" or ""wrong"". It speaks unfavourably to the intentions of a party when you say that they are ""not very nice"".  
  
Intention seems to be the fundamental divisor. By your saying that:  
  
&gt; But no, I don't think he's a very nice person and I come to that conclusion by judging him against my personal priorities for what makes a ""good person"" (e.g. compassion &amp; support for those less fortunate than himself).  
  
You have made a clear judgement against his intent (he doesn't want to help those less fortunate than himself). I don't know what he intends or what he thinks his policies will do but I try to give any politician (or indeed any person - not companies though) the benefit of the doubt and assume that they want to achieve good things. They just believe that the way to get there is different.  
  
Being nice or not nice is usually (to me) a functon of intent and not method. That isn't a hard and fast rule by any means but I'd argue that if you believe that what you are doing will help people in the long run, then even if you don't fully appreciate the rammifications of your actions, you are a good person. Naturally, if your methods are so extreme and so divorced from their goals then you can make the argument that this is no longer the case. I can't think of any policy in mainstream politics that fits that description though.  
  
Since you have judged his intent rather than his capability you are making (in my view) an attack on him and who he is. Which is what I meant when I said that the left tends to be more vicious in some ways than the right.  
  
Of course, the Daily Mail are being even more stupid than usual at the moment but I tend to ignore all the tabloids and pseudo-tabloids these days.

You could trim some fat and add some substance.  

Examples:

&gt; Erik Lamelaâs stay in England has so far been uninspiring and miserable.

Does the ""and miserable"" add considerably to your point?  I would argue that in this context it is equivalent to ""uninspiring"" and you should choose the one phrase that expresses most what you want to express and cut the other.

&gt;At the tender age of 23, the boy has the luxury of time on his side.

This sentence essentially calls Erik ""young"" three different ways and in 16 words.  You could generally use fewer words to say more things.

I would suggest that this is the crux of your challenge as a writer: unnecessary empty flourish versus genuine substantial content.  This is extremely common in inexperienced but intelligent writers.  I would guess you will grow out of it, but if you can find a strong editor, it would benefit you to work with someone who can show you where the fat is.  Make your points.  Make them with conviction.  Back them with facts and examples.  Cut the fat.  You can and should write with style...just not at the expense of substance.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"&gt; This isn't entirely true. James Rodriguez was hyped up because of the WC and he is doing extremely well for RM. Depay did really well for his country and he is proving to be a great player. Toni Kroos did really well in the WC and he is doing the same at RM also.

I just meant that assessing and buying a player based on his WC performances alone is a bad idea. Liverpool have also shot themselves in the foot with the same thing in the past. Performances for club are much more relevant to us. 

&gt; Why do you think we are scouting Depay?

Because buying a player needs huge amount of homework and work that goes unnoticed by us. They(scouts) spend many manhours assessing a player, analysing stats and more. Then they give their results to the club/manager/transfer committee/whatever to decide what to do. I'm sure we've scouted Depay longer than few seasons. We did that to Origi also. I think someone said that we were ""monitoring"" his progress since he was 15 or something.

&gt; He is proving he can play striker, he isn't glued to being a winger for the rest of his life. 

That is true but I think that winger is his best position. I mean, that's where he made a name for himself and he's the most effective there, or am I wrong? I have limited knowledge of him, but seen some of his games to get general idea who he is and I've read articles, PSV fans' opinions about him. If we buy him, I'd like the reason to be that we want a young player with great potential who is pretty versatile and not that we want him as a striker. That should be a different transfer. 

&gt; Sturridge was a RW when he was at Chelsea, when he came to us, he proved he can play as a Striker and has done so since.

I would say that the main difference is that Sturridge was originally a striker. At youth level and for City. He had a very successful loan spell at Bolton where he played only as a striker. Chelsea used him as a winger because they had other strikers ahead of him or just needed a winger. So, I would say that buying Sturridge as a striker was much less of a risk as he had already done it in Premier League. 

Vietto, Dybala and Icardi - hmm, all Argentinian and pretty young (21-22). Not that I have something against younger talent, but I think we are at a point where we need to look at some more experienced players also. Otherwise we end up with too inexperienced squad that takes too long to grow up. The club needs something for the short term also. Wouldn't say no to any of them, though. I'm just a bit worried about our squad - we severly lack players at their peak or near it.

Yeah, it seems to me that home maintenance has about the same cost wherever you are in the country whereas the capital cost of the property varies.

I.E. a tin of paint or a new boiler probably costs about the same in Yorkshire or Surrey, whereas the cost of a house might be several times as much in the latter.

* The section on energy promises a massive focus shift back to coal power and away from renewables, with policies such as ""Drop all subsidies for wind and solar power, to ensure a level playing field for coal"", ""Set up a commission to investigate ways to assist and rejuvenate the coal industry"" and ""abolish green taxes and levies and withdraw from the EUâs Emissions Trading Scheme""

When the War Doctor left in his TARDIS, his memories was reset by The Moment to the exact point in time where he was alone in the shack and about to activate it.  The Moment gave him the memory that he activated it.  Given that he had already seen the fighting, death, burning, and all that was left of the planet and Daleks was debris, his only logical conclusion was that The Moment worked and destroyed everything.

He would go on as 9, 10, and 11 (until all their time-lines crossed again) thinking that he destroyed his people instead of trying to save them.

Because The Moment used time vortexes to bring the Doctor's incarnations together when they are never meant to be together, all the previous incarnations would have to have the memories altered to forget what had happened from the exact time The Moment was activated onward.

null,false,Enigmaniac_,null,null,null,"Your theory has a huge positive and that is Clara never existed and a ginormous negative that Twelfth didn't either.

My take is that there is going to be more development of the Missy-Clara plot. For some reason Missy 'chose' Clara and wants her to be with Doctor. Also Doctor came quite uncomfortably close to breaking his rule and killing Missy for which Clara was largely responsible. While other companions used to stop him (basically the most moving conflict of series four- Tennant and a gun), this one urged him to do it and he agreed. 

And Utopia. It is a concept that goes back to RTD and Tennant's run. Utopia or the promised land has had an arc which wasn't quite tied up. The Matrix (mind storage thingy) only explains it on Earth where Missy was but the concept reoccurred with alien races who thought it was an actual place they could got to. And somehow Missy can go into the Matrix. But what if matrix was not the Utopia?

Doctor's personal Utopia is, of course, Gallifrey and it makes sense that when the universe is dying (end of series three), the home of the time-lords (in a pocket dimension) was the last refuge in face of the heat death. 

Another thing unexplained is River. She is in the library, uploaded, 'saved' if you will, yet Vastra can apparently contact her for a telepathic conference dream through time and space. And she says the name of Doctor, supposedly in Clara's mind and yet the Tardis-tomb door hears that and opens. Even when Clara is supposedly scattered through time and space she is still in the tomb. And the Doctor can talk to her. River linked telepathically to Clara. Clara linked to Tardis (to go to Trenzalore). So is River connected to Tardis now? Can we have her back? Please?

Well, its complicated. Time-Lords could give her a second set of regenerations like they did for Doctor and Master since her mind like other Time Lords is uploaded into a sort of matrix. Moffat could technically bring her back and have an epic fight between Missy and River, which was kinda my hope after Missy sexually assaulted the Doctor.

Another thing that might crop up is that Missy knows the Doctor's name and a tie in series 7 finale could be established using that.",null,0,null,1430929769,null,0,1430936052,0,cr0ct70,null,t3_352ayy,null,t1_cr0ct70,null,t3_352ayy,null,null,null,1432806125,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

True, it sounds *plausible* in a sense that it *could* happen, but it would be really, really, really, really, for lack of a better word, crap. Not only because A) It would mean the permanent return of a Doctor that had already left which should never ever happen (like, ever) and B) It would make the last few years, effectively, null and void which would be just stupid on the part of Moffat. The theory is sound-ish but I really dislike it.

But because I like to (and I'm really not being mean here, honest), I'll dissect this theory.

&gt;Series 7B and series 8 was all a dream

Meh.

&gt;Put into a dream state

Well, if there any point at which this could have happened? I don't recall any. And if it had happened off screen that would be a major cop-out.

&gt;Chose his face

Sure, but it's not unheard of for Time Lords being able to control their appearance. Romana did it, and with quite some skill, taking the form of a princess they had met before. Moreover, Capaldi had been in Doctor Who Universe twice before being cast as the Doctor, as Caellius in *Fires of Pompeii* and Frobisher in *Torchwood: Children of Earth*. And it's not unheard of for former cast members to return as new characters without explanation. Karen Gillan was also in *Fires of Pompeii*, Colin Baker was a Guard Captain, and (I forget the fellows name) there was someone who played two Time Lords, once in *The War Games* and then in the *Deadly Assassin*. So it's possible that there could be no real significance behind it. 
And while Moffat *Spoiler* is apparently going to address it in relation to Capaldi, I doubt it will be anything like ""It's all a dream"". I could give my own opinions why the Doctor took that appearance, but I doubt anyone cares.

&gt;Clara is the TARDIS

Well, first off, why would the TARDIS choose someone who the Doctor had only heard the voice of and not even seen? Surely it would make more sense for the TARDIS to take the form of someone the Doctor associated with the TARDIS, like Idris.

&gt;Returning Enemies

Seriously, enemies have been returning since the dawn of Doctor Who. Daleks? Cybermen? The Master? The Autons? The Macra? The Great Intelligence? All these guys had appeared in Classic Who a lot. Well, maybe not the Macra and the GI but the big three did. Returning monsters and baddies isn't really a a sign of anything. As for the Weeping Angels, their only appearance between series 7B and 8 was the tiny role in *Time of the Doctor*, everything else was series 3, 5, and 7A.

&gt;Gallifrey

I, uh, don't think this section even really adds anything to the theory. As for the guilt, 9 and 10 appeared to feel the burden of their decision much more heavily than 11 did. Remember, 11 was the one who forgets, 10 was the one that regrets (and I would say 9 was the one who accepts, maybe).

&gt;Is this the big twist?

I doubt it, and I hope not. Moffat, no matter how much I complain about his story arcs, is always very good with **ideas**, and I'm sure whatever he comes up with will be something we don't expect and I think will concern the Master (Well, expected that Missy was the Master, but that's not the point).


It's a thought out theory, and not too bad. But I don't like it.

The politics of the left are intrinsically more *compassionate*, while the right is intrinsically *individualistic &amp; practical*. Policies from the right appear, to someone with more left-leaning sensibilities to be inherently *uncompassionate* and that brings with it a moral judgement ""How could you be so cruel"".  The reverse is not true, and as it is nonsensical to attack someone for being ""too compassionate"" you end up with phrases like ""bleeding heart liberal"" or ""nanny state"" instead, which carry no moral overtones.

Thinking you can separate these judgements from politics is wishful thinking. I can't look at someone behaving in a way that I personally think is cruel and go ""But, y'know. I'm sure he means well."" 

&gt; Being nice or not nice is usually (to me) a functon of intent and not method. 

*Intent not method* is another way to say ""the end justifies the means"" which I inherently disagree with. If we start from the premise that every politician is trying to do the right thing, the end (or intents) are likely universally the same. No party would answer ""No."" to the question ""Do you want a healthy, productive society?"", but they could fundamentally disagree on the means (method) to get there.

For an example of Cameron the Cruel, we can look at deficit reduction. I think it is cruel to attempt to reduce the deficit by taking money from disability benefit claimants. I'm not a tax the bankers, the bonuses, the bankers, type of person, but there are plenty of places - tax evasion, not giving tax breaks to millionaires - to recoup that money without the disproportionate negative effects that that move had. That policy decision shows that, whatever the intended *ends* Cameron was happy to justify the *means* of causing undue stress and humiliation to countless individuals. I absolutely will judge him on that and make the conclusion he's *not a nice man*. 

Anyway, this whole thing just highlights how nonsensical the idea of left and right are. It should be possible to have a debate on ""how compassionate should the government be?"" or ""what value do we place on individualism over collectivism?"" but that will have to wait til we get an electoral system that supports it.

It's not an English test, the writing isn't the most important part of the exercise. The question is marked on how well a person can support their answer, not what that answer is. 

For example, the first boy could say the Crusades were acceptable because God ordered the Israelites to slaughter the Canaanites, thus setting a precedent. The second boy could say the Crusades were unacceptable because God isn't real. The first would be given higher marks for a better supported answer.

It just means that when they actually do pay, I have to now realize it as 13m. 

I think thats exactly what City did, judging by the settlement discussions surrounding the Bony deal. Negredo's deal was explicitly mentioned. We'll be able to recognize some of that 25m in this window but I don't think it'll be the full 25. Moreover, why cut it close to the margins only to have our accountants disagree with their accountants about compliance? If UEFA allowed us to recognize at least part of it early, its just a matter of them telling us how much. Compliance is assured though in that scenario, you can think of it as insurance.

EDIT: I think the whole ""adding up perfectly"" thing illustrates my point. Probably from City's point of view we think it adds up perfectly, but UEFA might not have thought so (especially with the disputed fees surrounding the Mangala transfer), so at the very least we got the green light from UEFA to account for part of Negredo's fee towards whatever UEFA thinks were over. Its all just a question of how much of Negredo's fee has already been ""used"" and how much we can use in this next window.

null,false,MrBeardyMan,null,null,null,"&gt; We are repeatedly told it has a funding shortfall

It is all about priorities, there is only a shortfall on the budget set - shifting government priorities could push billions more into the NHS. The classic example is stealing from the defense budget (where the waste is massive - don't google procurement scandals unless you WANT to get depressed), or perhaps decriminalising drugs and pushing the money saved from jails and enforcement into treatment and general healthcare. Just getting half the tax ~~dodged~~ avoided by companies paid into the system could cover a large increase in budget.

The fact is the NHS budget is too low, we pay less per-citizen into the NHS than all the comparable systems. Hell, we pay in less than the US government pay per-citizen and they don't cover the bulk of the population. Although it may not seem it the NHS is surprisingly efficient when looked at as the whole system.

Now covering the cost of an increasingly old population *is* still a problem. Some of this can be dealt with by better preventative care keeping people healthy for more of their increased lifespan. Putting more money into care homes is also would also save the NHS budget a chunk, currently the cuts to elderly care mean old people who are fit enough to release are getting stuck in very expensive hospital beds because there is no where to release them to.

I really don't agree with their policies on climate change(or their denial of) but I don't personally see that as a priority in this country right now.

I'll also have to say I'm not considering this policy as much as I would if UKIP had any chance of actually being in power, right now UKIP aren't likely to get many more than a handful of seats, meaning their influence will be limited to their core policies, I'll reconsider my support for UKIP next election if there's an actual chance of them getting in.

As for why I don't see climate change/environment as a priority, that's simply because the countries causing the biggest problem with pollution and such is countries like America and China, our actual influence to climate change is rather low in this country.

And councils respond by cutting the most visible services, while rallying against government in their glossy colour magazines (mostly Labour)

&gt; Largely campaigned against a chance of bettering our democracy because it's too expensive

All parties do that, unfortunately. Labour flip-flops on electoral reform (they wanted it in the 90s right up until they won), the Conservatives don't want it because they don't think it benefits them (we'll see tomorrow), the Lib Dems want it because they're a smaller party (and yes, they are totally screwed over by FPTP)

&gt; Introduced the so-called bedroom tax without ensuring a good stock of lower bedroom housing (and again, local authorities bear the brunt of the ire)

Can't argue with that, although we have to question why Labour couldn't have done a lot to fix the situation in their 13 years in power rather than continuing to hand out money to landlords

&gt; Letting G4S anywhere near a public contract after the Olympics.

Labour would do the same - the love of Serco/G4S and other incompetents is cross-party

Labour started the sell off of an entire hospital and they wanted to sell off Royal Mail too. Whether or not this government undervalued Royal Mail is up for debate

http://ukfeminista.org.uk/2012/01/building-feminist-activism-in-northern-ireland/

&gt;Iâve recently been appointed one of two Regional Organisers for UK Feminista in Northern Ireland.  UK Feminista is relatively new grass roots organisation aimed at supporting people to campaign for a world where women and men are equal.  Northern Ireland has a vibrant activist landscape and has recently witnessed an upsurge in grassroots feminism.  There have been sit-ins, knit-ins, vigils and feminist tv.  Stronger links with UK Feminista offer us the opportunity to tie in with a wider network of feminists. I recently attended FEM 11 in London and I was completely overwhelmed by the size and energy of the event.  There were literally over a thousand feminists filling the venue inside and outside with their energy.  To be able to tap into this wider movement is a great delight for me and will hopefully add something to the already vibrant feminist landscape in Northern Ireland.

&gt;There are many more important topics to be addressed within the Northern Ireland Context.  Trafficking is a major issue, as is rape and sexual assault and the approach adopted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in addressing it.  Safe and legal abortion remains inaccessible to most women in Northern Ireland within their own country.  Unfortunately the medical profession operate in a context in which abortion is assumed to be illegal.

&gt;We are putting plans together for a feminist activist training event to be held in March 2012.  We hope to deal with many of these issues at the event and we would like your input.  Please take five minutes to complete our short survey about Building Feminist Activism in Northern Ireland.  You can complete it by clicking on the link below.  We would love to hear from you:

&gt;The activities undertaken by the Belfast Feminist Network (BFN) are indicative of the new trajectories of feminist activism underway. The views presented here draw on our own experiences both as researchers in the field of gender and peacebuilding, and as active BFN members. We believe that highlighting these practices, which perhaps are less visible and on a much smaller scale than the more institutionalised womenâs sector, is crucial in order to discuss how feminists from different generations can work together to radically transform society in Northern Ireland and beyond.

Take this sentence from earlier:

""You see, for the idiotic ideology I'm following I had to construct the even more idiotic idea of a conspiratorial villain, so I decided to use the villain of every other idiotic ideology going, the Jews.""

and apply it to right-wing political conspiracy theorists of post-red scare America. After the 'enemy' of communism didn't take hold in the US, a new enemy had to be created for right-wing reactionaries.

Whereas communism allegedly threatened capitalism, 'cultural marxism' allegedly threatened the morals of American culture.

Now the group of the 'Frankfurt school' replaced 'Soviet Russia' as the enemy. But: All this happened after the things the right-wing reactionaries hate had happened. Society got more progressive, suddenly women and blacks and even gays received rights, and the good American old-timey morals disintegrated. Since it's impossible to the reactionary mind that these were natural developments happening on their own, a villain was sought after-the-fact.

And so the 'frankfurt school' with its 'cultural marxism' were branded as the instigator of all this change to the US culture. And they could have fingered any other loose group of activists, but the frankfurt school just was so jewish... how can a conspiratorial mind resist?",null,0,null,1430931291,null,0,false,0,cr0dsja,null,t3_351wbj,null,t1_cr0dsja,null,t1_cr0ct1k,null,null,null,1432806588,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; Intent not method is another way to say ""the end justifies the means"" which I inherently disagree with.  
  
To a certain extent I think that my point is less that the end justifies the means (because I am not trying to justify any behaviour) but rather that if the choice of means is meant well then the result of that should not be the value upon which we judge the choice. It also presupposes that you have a choice.  
  
As for your point about deficit reduction I could argue endlessly about the moral rights and wrongs of how the rich are taxed (not to mention whether that would help or not - the evidence of the French economy doesn't support the idea that hitting the rich works) but I will say that in some ways I don't think that he saw himself as having a choice but to cause the misery. I'd argue that taxing the rich sufficiently to support your compassionate society might result in a society that the rich no longer feel welcome in and, unfortunately, they can afford to leave. This could be catastrophic - they contribute (in absolute terms) a vast amount of tax - and would cause longer term misery in an order of magnitudes *worse* than what he has done.  
  
Or maybe I'm wrong - there is no real way to know.  
  
Back to your judgement: you believe that he had a better alternative but he probably doesn't. Either that or he is a nasty piece of work.   
  
&gt; this whole thing just highlights how nonsensical the idea of left and right are  
  
I don't know - I think that they do speak to how we view the world. I just don't think that it is clear cut what belongs where any more so in that way they are obsolete.

That's the entire problem. It might well be that sometimes people I'm for or against have a common denominator. The thing is, such denominators are almost always useless. Whoever came up with the conspiracy theory of the cultural marxist Frankfurt school likely actively looked for Jews to blame due to previous prejudices. 

Because you could as easily look for left-handed people as the bogeymen. People who have owned non-US cars. People who kissed someone a different colour than them. People who are a different colour. 

To quote myself again: Any collected set of ideas [all the stuff I'm against] which is attributed to a collective group [da Joos] and not individual human beings can be outright dismissed as a concept. It's dishonest and racist/xenophobic/whatever the correct word is.

So yes it can be denied that Jews seem to be over-represented in certain fields. Stop listening to those who meticulously search out the group they're against for bullshit reasons. For example: The picture in the article of all the jews who are supposedly against feminism. Where are all the dozens, hundreds of other people who are against feminism?

The secondary and tertiary effects of any individual action are difficult to predict, so I think it's quite possible in trying to act *more compassionately* to do more harm.

&gt; Back to your judgement: you believe that he had a better alternative but he probably doesn't. Either that or he is a nasty piece of work. 

If he has no alternative, why elect anyone at all? I would argue that even if reduction in benefits were unavoidable, the focus and proportion of cuts is completely discretionary. Looking at the balance sheet, Cameron (or Osborne) weighed up the options and chose to target some of the most vulnerable people in society. I can understand the logic, given that they aren't Conservative voters and the tabloid media was doing a number on 'scroungers' at the time, but I can't help but see it as rather cruel. I think calling him a ""nasty piece of work"" is a bit harsh, for what it's worth.

&gt; I certainly don't think that a new electoral system will change this though - we need a whole new discourse. Preferably not on twitter. Or Tumblr. Arguably not on reddit. 

I think (well, hope) that with a broader selection of parties available we'll move away from the left-right politics, and more into looking at actual policies. But you're probably right that this isn't going to be some magic bullet for intelligent discourse.

Anyway, this has been an interesting discussion. I think it's always good to have views challenged and you make very valid points on the reflex to judge the person which I'll watch myself for in future.

The problem with this kind of statement is that while people will nod sagely and say ""of course!"" it's not quite so simple.

So if it's not being done by people who are employed full-time to do admin, it ends up getting done by the clinical staff.

It's exactly what happened with the police forces throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Thousands upon thousands of civilian admin staff lost their jobs, with the result that the average copper now spends almost half his working day filling in the paperwork rather than actually being out on the streets.

As someone who is, but doesn't want to be economically inactive, I hear the overtures made by the political parties and the DWP and I see, without fail, nothing coming of it. The only thing you get out of them is ""you have to help yourself"".

null,false,TinyZoro,cnty-england,England,null,"I don't know this smells iffy to me. A journalist should not be going there to make the news everything about this article is a bit suspect. It is at best an article about a man who gets assaulted at a political rally yet it's titled ""A Jew in Bradford"" as though his personal experience is clearly synonymous with something far more general. He subtitles it ""How Britainâs Muslim North became George Galloway country."" Which appears to be a totally different heading for a totally different story. I don't see anything much in this over long piece that suggests he really sets out to explain that second objective. I.E. Galloway's long running support of Palestinian issues, courageous voice against Labour's terrible and illegal war and courageous voice against islamophobia so fashionable these days. 

It's the last issue that really triggers me. I am Jewish I see the acceptable marginalisation and insidious demeaning of British Muslims with deep concern as ever Jew should. 

The fact that this jewish journalist immediately conflates Galloways principled and impassioned rejection of the state of Israel with being a jew is something I completely reject. He doesn't speak for me or my family or parents or grandparents who are all vociferously against the status quo in Israel. The other thing that raises questions is this:

&gt;A white woman in thick lipstick, a press officer for Respect, comes up to me: âWho are you, I recognize your face?â I tell her my full name, Ben &gt;Judah. Her face sours: âBen Judah, the Tablet.â

&gt;A few months ago I had reported from the city for a Jewish online publication, and had been critical of Gallowayâs anti-Zionist rhetoric. I reported &gt;that he has inflamed a hissing conspiracy theory where Jews were blamed for 9/11, for all wars all over the world, and were seen as the new Nazis

This isn't a journalist who has gone to objectively report but one that has a story he wants to write. 

Of course that doesn't mean the idiot that punched him should not arrested for assault but I agree with Galloway. This reporter has gone out to get a story similar to this. His actions are pernicious. This is a deliberate smear against muslims in Britain far more dangerous than Galloway's accurate portrayal of Israel and a deliberate smear of Galloway who wasn't even present.

Problem is there're quite a few options here who are currently in the squad and some coming through/on loan. When all are fit, Walker (24) is first choice. With him injured, Dier (21, 6 months younger than Yedlin and bought in August) who's usually a first choice CB along with Vertonghen has been given the place, then if not him it's been Chiriches (another CB, 4th choice). So Yedlin's not getting time in ""his"" position over converted CBs which is not a good sign.

Then there's Ryan Fredericks (bit over a year older than Yedlin) who has been on loan at Middlesbrough who has supposedly played well. Then there's an academy player called Kyle Walker-Peters, turned 18 a few weeks ago and from what I've seen he looks like good/really good player already.

So in a few years you should have Walker arguably reaching his prime at 27, Fredericks at 25 and KWP at 21 and that's a big problem for Yedlin. From what I've seen he needs *a lot* of time, he's not going to get that in the current first team squad so either youth football (U21s which he's only had a couple of matches in so far, not a good sign) or loans are a must.",null,0,null,1430936492,null,0,false,0,cr0h9i1,null,t3_352ok6,null,t1_cr0h9i1,null,t3_352ok6,null,null,null,1432808234,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

* [China Could Get 85 Percent Of Its Electricity From Renewables By 2050, Report Finds](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/04/24/3650526/chinas-renewable-potential/)

&gt;Last year, China and the United States reached a carbon emissions agreement in which China committed to getting 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and to capping its overall carbon dioxide emissions that same year. By the end of 2014, the country of 1.3 billion had cut its coal consumption for the first time in more than a decade. 

Also, I was skimming through other parts and this bit really stood out:

&gt;INCREASING INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY  
Currently, British intelligence is fragmented between a number of agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and BBC 
Monitoring. All have different funding streams and report to different government departments. This generates a significant overlap in work and resources and risks exposing gaps in the system. UKIP will create a new over-arching role of Director of National Intelligence[.[.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance#Surveillance_state """"big brother"""").] who will be charged with reviewing UK intelligence and security, in order to ensure threats are identified, monitored and dealt with by the swiftest, most appropriate and legal means available. He or she will be responsible for bringing all intelligence services together; developing cyber security measures; cutting down on waste and encouraging information and resource sharing.

I guess a [right to privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy) isn't going to feature on any reworked bill of human rights they have anything to do with then?

&amp;nbsp;

I understand where you're coming from saying that their climate change stance don't bother you because UKIP is unlikely to be able to implement their full policy, and I'd understand if that extended to mass surveillance too. However these are key issues (which are arguably indicative of core priorities), and UKIP winning seats will mean having their voices weighing in on them in parliament. That's my concern, anyway.

Maybe you can clear up one thing I was really confused by looking over the manifesto. They make a big thing of their ""willingness to take the axe to politically correct spending programmes"" on the front page of the economy section, but never say what those programs are. The only thing they mention getting rid of that I can see being considered ""politically correct"" is inheritance tax, but that would cost the country money.

The model knows how the general patterns of support across the UK have changed in constituencies with different kinds of political, geographic and demographic characteristics. The model uses the Ashcroft constituency polls where available, plus smaller samples of polling data for every constituency, extracted from pooling many national-level polls. However, the model does not know whether your MP is beloved by constituents or embroiled in scandal, nor does it know whether Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage is standing in your constituency, let alone what the implications of that might be. Some of this might be picked up in the polls, but not all of it will be, and we do not have much polling data to go on when it comes to constituencies.*""

Wales-wide, though, they are predicting a significantly higher vote share for Plaid: 18% versus 13% in the two most recent full-scale polls. That'll be the real test for Election Forecast in Wales - if they're right and the polls are wrong, that would be quite a coup.

I'm just rather lost as to what feminism is anymore, it's become so fragmented. 5 years ago, I would have called myself a feminist, because I believe in equal right for men an women. But now there's so much toxic stuff out there, and you just constantly hear about daft things that feminists are up in arms against, or how they've ruined something you enjoyed, I just can't identify with that anymore, and I think that most 'feminists' wouldn't either.

So it really comes down to definition. Are feminists people who believe in equal rights for men and women? If so, then that is almost certainly most of us in this country, and there would be very little anti-male stuff.

I've read a few stories about him recently, one in the comment I'll link below and one by a professor who worked with him and claimed that he always stood by his convictions and was calculating and smart. 

He seems sincere which is odd for a politician and a lot of the papers (not that I really read them) are viciously attacking him. Now I don't hold the belief that Labour destroyed the economy because there seems to be a common denominator in all the countries that have been affected - the banks.

TTIP is a big deal though IMO and scanning(ctrl+F) through their manifesto it's only mentioned in relation to the NHS so there isn't a clear stance on this outside of the NHS(like how it could have an effect on banking industry). Now UKIP are out of the question for me, Greens &amp; Plaid(being Welsh) seem to have their hearts in the right place but the Greens have some dubious policies and I can't see plaid making an impact... The mass surveillance is also an issue and Labour only mentions strengthening oversight in their manifesto and reforming laws to keep up with technology(too loosely worded for my liking). I know the SNP, Greens, Plaid and UKIP are all pretty much opposed to this.

Breaking the Murdoch empire may well lead us to better discussions on these issues so should I use my vote to go to the party that I seem to agree with most, or vote for Labour even though I don't fully trust them after Blair (I feel kind of the same about Lib Dems but I understand the Lib Dems with Tories was NEVER going to go in their favour). Cognitive dissonance is strong with me today!

I feel that Cameron has tried his hardest to throw the election campaign so I'm actually wondering if there's something we don't know in the works that the Tories can use as leverage against whoever ends up in government during the next election.

That's nice and objective.

&gt;Bradford has also earned a reputation in Britain as unfriendly to Jews

I wonder whose being fanning that fire?

Are we talking about British people here - it's hard to tell. What's important here their allegiance to a political party, their ethnicity. Why does their ethnic background need so much emphasis.

&gt;On one level, this is obviously ridiculous. Nowhere in the UK has the Islamic legal system replaced British law. But this is not what &gt;they mean.
&gt;They mean illiberal minorities imposing their politics.

No they means some dirty immigrants who have no right to be here are destroying our white way of life. As a 'liberal' jew you can choose to justify this sentiment explain it as the righteous anger the white electrician had for sexist and homophobic culture or you can choose the hard place to stand with British Muslims not necessarily their values or politics but there in alienable right to be proud members of our country and have their views heard respectfully including on contentious issues like Israel and wars n the middle east.

I was actually suggesting that a corrupt politician is more likely to win, ruining it for all the honest people. It wasn't intended to be an ""all politicians are scum so what's the point"" post.

That makes absolutely no sense in and of itself, and in the context of the discussion.

In the thread of a conversation in which kim_bong_chill had implied that people didn't want to vote because candidates were generally corrupt, blueknight8 replied that not everyone running is corrupt and you then replied that it only takes one person to ruin it for everyone.

a) Your excuse about only meaning that corrupt politicians are more likely to win makes absolutely no sense in the context of voter apathy, which is what we were talking about and the post we're commenting is about.  It's a complete non-sequitur.  Why does a politicians' likelihood to win have *anything* to do with voter apathy?!  

b) Why would a corrupt politician be more likely to win anyway? By what mechanism?  

c) Why would that ruin it for *everyone*?!

I never thought you were saying that all politicians were corrupt or ""scum"".  It seemed pretty clear that you were saying that the presence of one corrupt politician taints people's perceptions of all politicians.

null,false,GiddyHorace,null,null,null,"We disagree on the reason people aren't voting for the Greens. I think you would be surprised how many people just don't want them. Perhaps in your circles the main debate is whether or not you take a gamble on them, but in the mainstream I don't think it's that difficult a choice. The battle isn't proving support of the Greens exists, it's proving the credibility of the party itself. Forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but I think there is a much broader challenge in front of us to persuade more of the electorate that they are a legitimate choice. Ideologically I think they are (although even I raise an eyebrow at some of their policies), but I think you are overestimating how big a proportion of this country is that 'radically' left wing. The majority of the country straddles the centre line ideologically... why do you think Labour shunted to the right in the first place? The two major parties get in year after year because that is where our society is. Everyone is pissed off and looking for an alternative, don't get me wrong, but no where near a majority of people see a solution in the Greens.

I suppose to compare, (in a very tenuous way) I think The Greens are perhaps one or two elections behind the SNP in that regard. And the SNP have a whole raft of other factors in their favour that have led to this surge in support. For a party to truly challenge the major parties, they need the masses support and the greens just don't have it yet. Not because of fear, because of their policies. 

That is why I will never ever think I've shot myself in the foot. I just don't think that is the main problem, I see it in much broader terms. Consequently, my priority is sustaining the long term momentum of the left wing parties which will be inconceivably harder under the Tories. They verge on criminal in their frantic attempts to quash dissent. At least under Labour it will be easier to sustain this momentum. Both in gaining support on the ground/galvanising people into actively joining in, and politically ie. fighting for proportional representation etc.

My other priority is keeping the Tories out (as you know! Ha). And actually, that comes above all else. They are the most toxic, repugnant incarnation of the Tory party in a generation. The stakes are much higher this election because we will not recover. The standard of living will be worse than it was before the world wars and I don't think it will improve again in our lifetime. So yeah, I mean maybe I'm a bit scared. But I think I'm right to be. I think everyone else should be. Because the damage that could be done is disproportionate to the support that will be gained by voting green. They aren't even in the same universe in terms of impact on the country/society/political landscape. This may sound like hyperbole, but the country really is at a fork in the road and it could dictate the outcome for the rest of our lives. A little surge for the Green Party will pale in comparison to the rest of the shitstorm we're in if the Tories get in.

And all this rhetoric about being 'brave' enough to vote green. I would like to ask my friends (I don't know your circumstances) how a relatively privileged, educated, employed person voting Green is brave? Brave why? What are the stakes for you if that incredibly plucky gesture doesn't pay off, the left is splintered and the Tories get in again? Because it is all well and good berating people for being cowards for tactically voting, but unless you really, deeply understand the impact in communities and experience it first hand every day, then you are not in a position to dictate what is brave and what isn't. 

And I don't think I'm unique at all, I didn't mean for it to come across like that. I am possibly a minority being that I am confidently able to reconcile my far left ideology and my voting Labour though, but I don't think I'm unique.

Traffic cones and hi-viz jackets, pottering around a car park while someone with a clipboard writes down the things they're going to say to you when you stop.

As for the full test, I don't know much about it as it is now, but when I took it I was told it was really just the same as a car test except the examiner follows you around, usually on another bike with a radio headset so he can give you directions.

I passed my bike test long before my car test, so I'm going off what others told me about the car test at the time.

I didn't attend my first test because my instructor told me I wasn't ready. He was right.

My second test I failed because I touched the ground with my foot during a U-turn. This seems trivial, but touching the ground with your foot means you've failed to use the controls to stabilise the bike, meaning you've effectively lost control of it. Bad, and an immediate fail, if I remember correctly.

My third test I passed, even though I nudged over a 30MPH speed limit.

I passed that test in '97 on my first bike, a Suzuki RG125 Gamma. It was a snotty little two-stroke which might have done 70 had it been knocked off a cliff by a hurricane but it was great fun at the time and coincided with a rare summer of sunshine and dry roads. Loved it, rode it, broke it, fixed it, rode it some more until my licence matured, I couldn't fix it any more, and wanted something bigger.

Basically, don't fall off, practice exaggerated observation (because you're being watched closely *and* because other road users just won't see you as easily as they would a vehicle large enough to threaten their life so you kind of make up their observation deficit), stay within the law and you should be fine.

It might have changed significantly since I passed but if you ask over at /r/motorcycles I'm sure a UK redditor who passed more recently than myself would be able to give you more info.

First off, simplify calories. People shouldn't need to keep track of 2,200 of anything, including calories. It's too complicated. Knock two zeros off, and round up/down. 

Something that is 150 calories becomes 2 MegaCalories^^tm. 

Something that is 325 calories becomes 3 MegaCalories^^tm.

Etc. I made a spreadsheet up and did it with a bunch of foods. A days worth of MegaCalories, with the rounding up/down still comes to as near as matters the right amount of real calories. And it's a fuckton easier to keep track of small numbers. 

Second stage is force food and drink (including alcohol) manufacturers to print the megacalorie count on the front of any food that isn't fresh produce. The megacalorie count should be for if you eat the entire thing, with the per portion amount in small fine print. The opposite of what they do now. 

Along with the megacalorie count there should be a QR code with all the nutritional information embedded in it. 

Third stage is create a free mobile app that lets people easily keep track of what they're eating. 

The last stage is a huge advertising campaign. Buses, TV, Radio, Newspapers. This shit should be everywhere. And it should be sustained for a minimum of 5 years, with a large advertising campaign at least once every other year from then on. 

The campaign should tell people that women need 20 megacalories, men need 22 mega calories in general. Download the app to get a more accurate estimation of your needs. 

It should also become part of the school curriculum. It should be taught for at least on lesson in primary school and one lesson in secondary school.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"There are plenty of pro-abortion feminists who think that Ireland and Northern Ireland should be pro-choice an allow for unfettered access to abortions and the necessary improvements to Obs/Gynae care that we take for granted. 

Put it this way? I work in India and we have easier access to safe abortion than Ireland and the USA. I have done abortions (as a doctor) here. I have assisted in late term abortions. People LOVE to think all abortions are those. More than 50 to 70% of what I do (Never really keep count) when I was in Obs/Gynae was medical abortions. A handful were surgical and most of those were due to issues out of the control of the mother. In general abortion benefits the poor as they can control how many children and the children they do have get a better life. Now there are abuses of abortion but you won't stop them by banning abortion. 

I mean? People speed in theiir cars all the time, doesn't mean we can live in a pony economy. 

Ireland and NI have a strong habit of keeping Catholics happy and to keep be a ""good"" Catholic you need to buy into pro-life. Ireland has a drive to legalise abortion thanks to (sadly) the death of Savitha. IF you aren't aware? A Hindu was forced to not have an abortion despite the fact it would have saved her life due to the beliefs of the hospital. The hospital was roundly condemned across the world for 

1. Forcing a religious belief onto another. This used to be an enormous problem in hospitals in India by the way where you would see Rice and Peniciillin conversions (AKA convert for food/medical care). Note this is particularly horrible for Hindus as Hindus specifically do not have missionaries because doing charity with the sole purpose of conversion is considered a con or dirty. Many Hindus do not like the westernised Hare Krishna for this very reason. They are seen as ""bad Hindus"" for not recognising the fact that everyone goes to paradise if they are good which is more important than the gods they pray to. Most Hindus are mad about conversions rather than the beliefs. 

2. Secondly? The pregnancy was indicated for an abortion. 

3. Thirdly? It was forcing a woman to not have an abortion based on the dialogue of a bunch of virgin/sex free men whose only qualification were ancient literature and Latin rather than women and doctors. 

Basically it pissed of 1/7 people on the planet, Doctors (many of whom in the UK and Ireland come from that 1/7th of the world) and most human beings. 

But the Church rallied and hid it's pro-life views behind more ifs and buts rather than going ""It's simple. If you are pro-life then don't abort your baby. Don't tell others what to do with their own bodies"". 

If you want to see what these feminists do? They often come to England to smuggle morning after pills and the like back to NI. They aren't ""speaking"" but actually doing things to break the law to protest about it.

What will be the interesting thing here is how reduced her majority becomes due to the presence of UKIP. However Ken Rees the UKIP candidate is a former Liberal Democrat who traditionally drew the protest votes from Labour, so many voters who would have voted lib dem may feel betrayed and swing back to Labour. While Plaid has invigorated the Youth movement in Llanelli, the majority of those members are under 18. They also don't seem to have successfully convinced the core voters (i.e. the large retired population of Llanelli) to move away from their tradtional union roots. My personal expectation for this seat is Labour Hold with a reduced majority.

I don't know how much of an excuse the transfer committee can be used to protect Rodgers, but the transfer committee definitely failed us/Rodgers this summer.

A lot of why I think we were great last season was our tactical flexibility, we could change styles and shapes at half time... I feel like we haven't seen that kind of management this season. We've been very slow to adapt and Rodgers has made blunders and repeated them regularly before making changes.

I think a lot of this is ""growing pains"" because Rodgers is a young manager with a young squad. He still needs time to grow as a manager and I think that's what we picked up - a manager who's got the potential to grow.

For me regarding Rodgers. It's a question of how patient we can be as we wait to become a force again. Last season the transfer committee failed us, but with Suarez and Sturridge and Rodgers' having the right tactics and consistently getting it right we almost achieved great things. This season we've had the transfer committee and Rodgers let us down and it seems almost all our good work is undone.

If Rodgers isn't to leave the club, and in all honesty I don't think he will, then he's certainly got to improve on the strange lineups and refusal to make changes in the middle of matches we've seen this season. I think we all hope for reverting a bit to last season where we could adjust the shape of our diamond (doesn't have to necessarily mean we go back to a diamond, just changing the shape of our midfield/team) in ways that could help us cover our weaknesses and focus on the strength of getting the ball to Sturridge and Suarez.

I also think having Suarez and Sturridge in full form opened up space for Gerrard to operate as deep lying playmaker. Without that movement up there, its easier for people to stick to Gerrard and stop him from creating from deep. We've struggled to adapt tactically this season.

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"So, grabbing some stuff from the Man Utd financial report (because they're a Plc so it's easy to find and pretty damn comprehensive, and also they have a more recent report published than we do), they give the following:

Property, plant and equipment - Â£255m

Goodwill [intangible assets such as the Man Utd brand and logo] - Â£421m

Players' registrations [value of the squad when you account for the amount of time remaining on contracts] - Â£204m

Deferred Tax Asset [tax that they've paid that they'll get back or shouldn't be counted for whatever reason] - Â£130m

Trade and other receivables [money they're owed] - Â£125m

Cash and cash equivalents - Â£66m

Which all boils down to an estimated grand total of Â£1.2bn in just ""stuff"" that you'd get if you bought Man Utd right now (or, more accurately, when that balance sheet was made). That's not accounting for the amount of profit they earn (or lose) in the future, that's just what the club is worth on paper. Obviously if you'd consider the club to be a profitable entity each year, that value goes up to recognise the return on investment you get from owning that Â£1.2bn book value of everything. 

As you can see, a serious chunk of Man Utd's value as a football club actually has nothing to do with the squad or stadium, but is basically the global brand strength - probably because they have such a huge following in Asia. And while that goodwill value can drop if the club performs poorly, it's probably unlikely to drop particularly quickly because most people don't change football clubs that whimsically. 

I'd be for Real Madrid, Barca and Bayern that it's a similar story - the club and squad is worth a lot but it's fundamentally the global brand, and the merchandising rights and revenue which come with it, that make up a lot of the value of the club.

That excuse doesn't work in this case though. It wasn't a manifesto promise that could only be kept if they had a majority. It was a very specific pledge to vote against any raise in tuition fees during the life of the parliament. Here is the wording incase you forgot: 

&gt;âI pledge to vote against any increase in fees in the next parliament and to pressure the government to introduce a fairer alternative.â

Every Lib Dem signed it, including Nick Clegg. They of course signed it to try and secure the student vote, then soon decided they didn't actually mean it. Even a single MP party could have kept that promise. They can try and blame it on being in a coalition as much as they like, but if they were willing to trade that promise away they should never have made such a firm pledge in the first place. It shows a terrible lack of judgement.

Was listening on the Daily Politics today, after May 7th the current government has first chance to form a government by issuing their Queens Speech in early June. This is regardless of whether they think they have the numbers or not, it is still their right to stay in #10 until they're voted out or resign (as Gordon Brown did in 2010). If the Queens Speech is voted down it doesn't mean they leave office either, there has to be a vote of no confidence in her Majesties government. If this passes then David Cameron will go see the Queen &amp; 'recommend' she allow the leader of the opposition to attempt to form a government, this would be Ed Miliband. Note the leader of the opposition doesn't have to have command of the commons at this point, he doesn't have to make any deals. He can then propose his Queens Speech to the commons &amp; attempt to form a government himself by allowing MPs to vote on it. 

The troubling matter for Labour of course (and I didn't realise this before), the SNP can vote down a Labours Queen's Speech or a Labour budget &amp; this wouldn't bring down the government. You *need* a vote of no confidence or resignation to remove the government now (or a 2/3rds majority). Of course Labour could threaten to resign if this happened (Miliband hinted to this when he said he wouldn't govern if it meant a deal with the SNP) but that would be their choice &amp; it wouldn't be the SNP putting the Tories in power or causing another election. Sturgeon has actually said this is something they may consider, that is to support getting a Labour government in power but voting down a budget that follows what she describes as ""Tory policies"".

My issue is that people often don't see smaller parties as viable candidates *because* they get a low share of the vote. They get disregarded entirely because 'Why bother? It's a wasted vote'. I'm under no illusion that every man, woman and child in Britain is a secret Green supporter (I'm not even sold on them myself), but these things have to start somewhere. People were saying the same thing about the Lib Dems for decades, and no matter your stance on them, they got into government and got shit done, because people voted for them. Ukip went from being an unknown to massive gains and a win in Europe in a few short years. If your plan is to make sure minor parties get a larger share of the vote every election, surely voting for them would achieve that goal rather than letting other people bear the responsibility? Surely fighting for those gains is *even more* important when you actually might have a chance at progress when your vote actually matters is better than doing it when Labour are going to have a sure win anyway?

I'm afraid of the Tories getting back in. I've been hit by their policies like many people, and dread the idea of things getting even worse, but by maintaining the cycle of the big two you're ensuring that they'll be back eventually. They are bigger than the other parties, better funded than the other parties, and know that if times get tough, they can scare enough people into voting tactically against Labour.

So it's all well and good to say that people are on the whole pretty centrist, that they *want* the two big parties overall, but when tactical voting is such a huge phenomenon, forgive me if I'm a little skeptical of the result. Of course, you are free to vote for whoever you like. Would you say that keeping the Tories out is a bigger priority than pushing things further left, though?

However, even if they get less than that but a party member wins an electorate seat they can take extra MPs in with them, which means that you can potentially have one electorate given 4% of the seats. One example was in 2008, where despite only getting 3% of the vote ACT was able to get 5 members in parliament because they won an electorate seat.

There's also an issue here of strategic voting, where candidates from tiny parties win electorate seats as proxies for larger ones so that they can get more seats overall. The main example here is [Epsom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_%28New_Zealand_electorate%29), which is a very firm National (our main right wing party) electorate. However, ever since 2002 it's been won by the ACT party, despite the party not getting over the 5% threshold since 2002 (in last year's election, they got 0.69% of the vote, only slightly more than the Legalise Cannabis party.) Why this is important is that with the way MMP works, parties are allocated their electorate seats, and then receive remaining seats until their number of seats reflects the percentage of the popular vote they got. So because ACT wins Epsom instead of National, it's essentially a national seat that doesn't count towards their percentage, meaning they get extra influence.

It is sited at the [Pier Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Head) and along with the neighbouring [Cunard Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunard_Building) and [Port of Liverpool Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Liverpool_Building) is one of Liverpool's *Three Graces*, which line the city's waterfront. It is also part of Liverpool's [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) designated [World Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) [Maritime Mercantile City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Maritime_Mercantile_City).

&gt;Opened in 1911, the building is the purpose-built home of the [Royal Liver Assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liver_Assurance) group, which had been set up in the city in 1850 to provide locals with assistance related to losing a wage-earning relative. One of the first buildings in the world to be built using [reinforced concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforced_concrete), the Royal Liver Building stands at 98.2Â m (322Â ft) tall to the top of the spires, and 50.9Â m (167Â ft) to the main roof. It was the tallest storied building in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) from completion until 1932  and the tallest in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) until 1961. The Royal Liver Building is now however only the joint-fourth [tallest structure in the City of Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Liverpool), having been overtaken in height by [West Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tower), [Radio City Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Tower) and [Liverpool Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Cathedral).

&gt;Today the Royal Liver Building is one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city of Liverpool and is home to two fabled [Liver Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_Bird) that watch over the city and the sea. Legend has it that were these two birds to fly away, then the city would cease to exist.

I'm not saying that Brand is a great interviewer or an astute political analyst. He isn't. But his style is better than just about all the main media organisations I can think of. Watching a few of his videos and I can tell that he actually gives a shit about presenting the facts.

A lot of people don't really want to drive in. I'm willing to bet that a lot of people who drive in don't actually live that far away. The reason they drive in is because it's quicker and more reliable to drive in than take public transport. 

Take Stokes Croft for example, another problem area. A lot of people that work near that area drive in, again because it's a lot quicker than getting a bus. I can drive from Knowle to Stokes Croft in about 20-30 minutes on a good day, and there's a ton of routes I can take to get around most traffic. The bus takes much longer, isn't much cheaper than driving, and is unreliable. I often cycle in, but I still feel like any moment I'm going to get hit by a bus or sucked into a pothole.

They won that huge share of the vote on the back of years more influence than the Greens have had. It was a shock yes, but not that shocking. They had chugged along for many elections gaining more and more support over decades. I don't really have an answer for the UKIP phenomenon though. I suppose an inherently Right wing press and the fear mongering that is rife in our society has facilitated that a bit. I think the Greens battle is slightly more uphill than UKIPs unfortunately.

Mmm the implication that I'm shirking my responsibility by not voting Greens is a bit unfair I think. As I say, it isn't out of fear, it is a extremely pragmatic decision that I've made. I'm not sitting here rubbing my hands at all the other people voting Green and taking the fall for me while I sit smugly voting Labour.  Not voting Green for me is a compromise personally, but one that I would encourage other Green voters to make. I have had to put my own ideologies on ice and get my hands dirty a bit because I believe it is the right thing to do for the majority at such a critical juncture in this country's history. I have many people ranting at me that they have to stay true to what THEY believe in, but frankly, that argument to me feels cringingly self indulgent. Like, this election isnt about me or my principles. It's about the people becoming homeless because of the bedroom tax, people unable to live even a vaguely decent life because of 0 hour contracts, people who can't even challenge the system that is rigged against them because 100% of citizens advice has been cut.

null,false,locster,uk,Leamington Spa,null,"&gt; OK, so which Western state has been victim of aggression by another state since WWII that wouldn't have been in that situation if they had nukes?

I can't think of a single western nation that isn't protected by NATO and therefore nuclear powers within NATO (see my previous wall of text about the role of France and UK within the EU and NATO), i.e. it seems like another straw man argument to me.

More widely, perhaps nations relevant to the argument are Kuwait, Ukraine, Korea (before it split), South Korea since the split, Georgia, Israel, Iran, Pakistan and India, maybe Vietnam.

I think the main point here is that most nations that would benefit from nuclear deterrence have sought a deterrence under NATO, so there aren't really any nations that meet your criteria.

&gt; Did we have nukes when Argentina invaded our soil?

OK nice point. My argument would be that the Falklands invasion did not represent an existential threat to the UK as a whole. From a military threat point of view, taking the Falklands is not equivalent to taking the same amount of land somewhere on the UK mainland. It's a very isolated piece of land with minimal importance to the UK as a whole (arguably it could be very useful in future, so need to be a *bit* careful how I argue that one).

It would also be grossly disproportionate for a government to even mention nukes in the course of such a conflict given the massive disparity in destructive capability between the two sides. The international community would make life very hard for any nation throwing their weight around in such a way (think sanctions, loss of diplomatic relations with many nations, loss of trade, lesser status in the UN, etc).

In short I think it's a good point to cover because it was a territorial invasion of a nuclear power, and that's highly unusual (maybe even unique in that respect). i would say that the unusualness of the situation represents the unusualness of the circumstances - a remote territory with essentially no military defence (it has lots now!!) next door to a crackpot dictator with something to prove.

But in the grand scheme of things it represents a minor skirmish in wider historic and world military balance terms, compared to e.g. recent events in Ukraine or the Middle East or North Africa, Afghanistan, etc. 

Nukes are big scale strategic 'chess pieces', versus the Falklands which is more of a pawn (sorry Falklands), i.e. you wouldn't get into a large scale war over the Falklands, let alone a nuclear exchange.

As it stands, the SNP can huff and puff all they like but they will lose all political credibility if they allow Cameron to stay in power when they could have a say in preventing it. They *will* vote through a Miliband Queens Speech. Moreover there is certain issues where the Tories can't possibly vote on party political lines like Trident where the SNP are expecting unrealistic concessions.

I agree its a dodgy route to take and frustrating to watch because it will make people think hes dishonest, and in an ideal world I'd want him to come out and say ""well the SNP winning in Scotland this time is a matter of fact but we can reverse it and its better to have them being a peripheral influence than UKIP"".

From 2000-2010 the bottom 25% of people ended up paying more of the relative income tax bill. In the last 5 years this has reversed and the bottom earners are now paying less than ever.

Basically, this table would discredit 90% of articles by Owen Jones.

The Labour party like you to think that it is the party of social mobility and fairness, the problem is that their record never backs this up. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher than when it left, and in 2010 left with much more inequality amongst workers than today.

That being said, you're probably faster if you get somewhere on a train line. The London station for MK is ""Euston"". So either get the tube from Heathrow to Euston (slowwww), or the Heathrow connect to Paddington then a shorter tube journey (more expensive), or the Heathrow express and another tube journey (Â£Â£Â£).

As for the train, there's Virgin Rail and London Midland. London midland are cheaper but slower on most trains per hour. There is one that only stops at Leighton Buzzard and Bletchley before Milton Keynes Central which is cheaper. Virgin is express. Visit nationalrail.co.uk for timetables. Buying an advance ticket for one operator will be cheaper (buy in advance) than an anytime (walk up) fare. 

What I would suggest is looking into flying into Birmingham, it saves the hassle of London. Birmingham Airport has a station which is connected to MK again by London Midland and Virgin.

As for in MK, they do have buses (I think Arriva is the main operator) but there's no oyster etc. You're better off getting a bike tbh, great city for cycling.

I'm not disagreeing that the highest earners should pay the most, I never have said that. All I'm saying is that the argument that the highest earners have got off scott free in the last 5 years doesn't seem to have much merit.

Just about ANY flat tax you apply on a product, whether it be VAT, petrol duty, tobacco duty, anything is a regressive tax. Because it is a flat amount or % of its value rather than means tested it will take up more of a proportion of a poor person's income than a rich person if they were to buy the same basket of items. That is how you get to the conclusion above of 43%/35%. 

For example man A earns 200 pounds a year, man B earns 20 pounds a year. They both like cakes and their VAT bill for cakes is Â£2 a year, this is 1% of man As income and 10% of man Bs income. When you add all these little taxes up they swallow up more of man Bs income even though man A pays huge amounts more in means tested taxes, like income tax, capital gains, NI, council tax etc.

There isn't much you can do about it except from a) cutting these taxes (which will then disproportionately benefit poor people because they will be keeping a larger proportion of their income than rich people) or b) somehow means-test every single penny that goes into the Exchequer.

David M then went on a big sulk and refused to join Ed M's shadow cabinet. It took two years before he finally left for the USA and got out of Ed's hair.

Here's Alex Salmond, oil economist, on the oil price:

&gt;âEven with a cautious estimate of oil prices remaining at $113 a barrel, itâs clear that Scottish oil and gas could generate three times more than official estimates.â

In truth the oil price had only ever been above $100 for five years in the entire history of oil. In addition oil has a history of violent swings in price. From the start of 2014 various people from Deutche Bank to Professor McDonald from Glasgow university were predicting a drop and by the date of the referendum it was $93 a barrel, already 17.6% *down* from Salmond's ""conservative"" estimate.

But all his desperate supporters could hear was ""it could be worth three times as much, $330! We'll be rich, RICH!""

And after a yes vote, he'd have shrugged and said, ""Oopps suckers. No we cannot have another vote. Just embrace your poverty and drink from the ditches for being so gullible while I go down in history"".

If the SNP could take such a callous attitude towards Scots, how would they treat the rest of us? Like all National Socialists, they are interested in power rather than the people. People are just useful idiots to help them get what they want.

More SNP MPs also means more left-leaning votes in a parliament that is likely to see less Lib Dems and more UKIP, so I'm personally happy with this.

In general, I'm also happy to see broader representation of different parties, and think that a coalition is overall a good thing. I'm a bit confused about why there's been so much said against the SNP in the media recently, and unsure why both Con/Lab are generally against an SNP coalition.

I also think that a stronger SNP presence would bring greater focus on devolution of powers and electoral reform, which I broadly think is a good thing.

Of course, it's not up to me and if the people of Scotland think the SNP should be in government, then they should be.

What a mortgage calculator will base the calculation on is solely a disposable income multiplier.

They can't however overlook mandatory payments that you're bound to pay by contract, such as credit card loans, car loans (general credit that you must pay back).

Not many people, at least among the somewhat educated, will challenge the legal legitimacy of a government properly elected. What people will challenge is whether the government in question properly represents the will of the electorate according to their own personal conception of what that means. 

You can't just discount that by saying ""yeah well the law is what it is so tough luck"", or rather you can but you shouldn't expect it to end the debate. If you want to do that, you have to show that either their way of seeing ""electoral legitimacy"" doesn't make sense, or that your way of seeing it (electoral legitimacy = legal legitimacy) is better.

For example, you could argue that even the people that don't think a government is legitimate wouldn't want to live in a system where this legitimacy isn't set down in law. Therefore, even if this time they don't like it, it's in their own interest to approve of this government's legitimacy, and either legally change the rules for the next time or change the government.",null,0,null,1430949667,null,0,false,0,cr0qb00,null,t3_353699,null,t1_cr0qb00,null,t3_353699,null,null,null,1432812565,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's just whether this counts as a meal for 2 in the sense of someone offering to buy you dinner. There's a limit somewhere since nobody would expect the garage to cough up if she'd spent a billion quid on the meal, and everyone would if she spent Â£10, so it's just a question of where that limit is.

I'm totally guilty of this myself.  As an englishman living in the Republic, I treat the north (lower-case north - the entire upper third of the island, regardless of borders) as ""their problem"".  ""they"" have their own issues, their own positions, their own answers, and their own responsibility.  I want nothing to do with it, and I don't want to be seen to have any opinion on it.

I do believe in self-determinism, partially because it seems just, and partially because it absolves me entirely.  It's their choice, they live with it, and they can take responsibility for it.

The whole situation up north is hugely improved, for which both sides should be thankful.  But I am old enough to remember when taking sides could get a man killed, and I still act accordingly.

Now, this is where it starts to go wrong with regards to mainlanders taking an interesting in NI politics.  We've spent so long try to keep a safe distance, that the majority of us no longer really understand issues particular to the region.  We have a rough idea that everything revolves around friction between the protestants and the catholics - and that's about it.  I have no idea if it's even still true, but it's essentially the sum of my political understanding.

I have no idea who's right, who's left - who's progressive, and who's tied down by tradition and dogma.  I have no idea if popular opinion follows that of the ruling elite, or if they're stuck with a US-style political hegemony where it's too difficult to move the dominant interests.

3. Wrap Hazard in cotton wool - looks like he's on holiday and I wouldn't mind Costa going on hol now.

4. Would be nice to see Baker get a run out (if he's returned yet?)

Our society has absolutely changed in the last five years and the 400+ people now reliant on food banks sure haven't been cushioned by our flexible labour markets. (Neither has employment really).

The problem for most people is two fold:

- Firstly people want cuts to be either handled responsibly (or not at all; which is a legitimate position to take) in order to avoid harming those who need them most. Take your analysis, if an ageing population is going to be a big issue in 2027 we need an NHS and social care structure in place to accommodate that. It's no good chopping them up now to reduce debt fast and then hoping that the private sector can step in. Policy billed at the expense of society at large will never work (see: be popular/wanted), there's no requirement that you aid and abet the most wealthy in society in order to support/be a Tory so why this current leadership refuses to do something at the expense of the few for the many is beyond me.

- Secondly is the idea of fairness throughout. People aren't opposed to making changes now in order to see progress down the line but they expect the impact of that to be fair, if low income households see a decline in living standards so too should high earners (although let's face it they'll still have a sweet life compared to most). Furthermore, many statistics aren't meeting peoples expectations because of the disproportionate share of wealth and power across the UK. For instance when people in the Welsh Valleys see an unemployment rate so different to people in the SE are they supposed to feel like things are getting better? Not for them. 

Lastly is simply the crowd the Tories have been pleased to pander to. They've not avoided the elites throughout their time in power and have no reservations about being chummy with big business, Murdoch's press and worst of all ... Katie Hopkins! It's like a triple whammy of ""Things people hate"".

null,false,waldron76,eng-Bristol,Bristol,null,"Well your criticisms were hardly fleshed out - you don't explain why you think feminism is ""too post-modern, authoritarian, ideological and detached from reality."" But, fine, another point I disagree with:

&gt; It's merged with identity politics, in which your gender/religious/racial identity is now perceived to be as important as what you actually think.

This is because your identity will inevitably colour your views and opinions on, well, any subject. Opinions don't occur in a vacuum, and so-called ""identity politics"" is really just an attempt to contextualise them. If we lived in a society that was colour-blind, gender-blind etc., then identity politics could be dispensed with. But we don't, so they can't. I will agree that it can be a little heavy-handed, but, well, humans as a whole have a tendency to struggle with nuance.

&gt; You also declared what I wrote to be 'ill-informed' again without giving a reason.

The fact that you thought that feminism has ""become increasingly anti-male"" was evidence enough, and that you don't know the difference between different waves of feminism kinda proves that you've launched into this critique from a position of ignorance on the subject. 

&gt; All I care about is whether the feminists I read in the media or encounter online and IRL are promoting good arguments - or thinly disguised bigotry.

From my experience most are providing good arguments. Or, at least, not promoting bigotry - a lot of feminism in popular media tends to be pretty basic Feminism 101 stuff, or poorly-argued claptrap (as with all ideologies). The only bigoted feminism I've seen is from extremists, or from idiots and/or teenagers on social media.

null,false,DirtD4er,null,null,null,"I played soccer as a kid, and loved it.  Then when I was about 8 we moved, couldn't play again until I was about 12 where I got 2 years of playing on a terrible team which won 2 games in 2 years.  Still loved it.  Then we moved again, to a rural area where there wasn't a high school soccer league/team, and to play my parents (who are lower middle class) would have had to pay/commute 25 miles to put me on some random school's team.

So I always loved the sport.  Just rarely had a chance to play it, or watch it.  When the nightly news would occasionally show the big high school teams highlights from the city 25 miles away I teared up at times because I missed playing it so bad.

It's worth noting too, that there were no MLS or USA games on broadcast TV, the only soccer game I remember being able to watch on TV was the Women's World Cup Final that the USA won, in 96 or so.  Soccer was purely a sport I had played (center back or full back, usually) and never watched.

So I grew up and went to college, loving soccer, but never playing it, hardly knowing anything about European soccer (except that I hated Manchester United, because that was the only team whose gear I had ever seen in malls or stores, and people who were snobby and pretended to like soccer but had never played wore it).  In college one of my roommates was a guy who had lived in Madrid for a time, become a Real Madrid fan, and introduced me to streaming (maybe 2008, so crappy streams).  I played intramural soccer and pickup as much as I could then.  (Also, my school had a bit of a unique culture, and my dorm's ""movie"" to show to the freshman was Green Street Hooligans, which is where I first heard of West Ham and other PL teams.)

I picked up FIFA in 2009, loved it a lot, played with a lot of teams, but I liked West Ham because Mark Noble and Scott Parker could sprint the full game, which was an advantage in games when you couldn't pick a 5 star team, and loved Eto'o on Barcelona to my roommate's dismay.

So I decided around then I was going to begin following English soccer, as I had never lived within 300 miles of an MLS team in my life, the league was never televised, and I had zero connection to it really.  (I'm now a casual Seattle Sounders fan, as I've moved to Seattle within the past year.)  So I began to look into various Premier League teams.  The big winners were always out as I'm not a bandwagoner, and I'm a sucker for teams that look good, have potential, and then always fail (my other love is the Minnesota Vikings in the NFL; lost 4 Super Bowls before I was born, and in my life time have made it back to within a game of the Super Bowl 4 times, only to lose in heartbreaking fashion, including in 2009).

So I found myself somewhat attracted to West Ham and Newcastle for no good reason, I looked into their history.  About the first thing I read was Thames Ironworks.  So that locked it in instantly for me - I was studying welding engineering, I love metallurgy, I have a massive respect for metalworkers.  So then I decided I was a West Ham fan.  Naturally the first thing to do then was look at the league table.

20th.

Relegation.

What a start.  So the first full season I followed West Ham was in the Championship, it was tons of fun, streams were blurry, I listened to one game on a radio stream, and I was convinced Vaz Te was the best footballer in England.  Things progressed from there.

So, ask for clarification on bits you think I should have expanded on or places where you think I should provide evidence.  Sorry, but I don't have the time to write a 20 page essay and I doubt anyone would read it.

&gt;Opinions don't occur in a vacuum, and so-called ""identity politics"" is really just an attempt to contextualise them.

I disagree with this quite strongly.  An argument should rely on its logic and power.  Its author's identity should be irrelevant.  The whole point of reason is that it is in principle open to independent verification by anyone - regardless of their identity.  Remove that, and you've taken a step back to subjective unverifiable truths - little more than religion.

&gt;From my experience most are providing good arguments. Or, at least, not promoting bigotry

I accept that.  But do you accept that there are prominent feminists who really are resorting to bigoted arguments?  

This isn't just a problem with feminism - it happens with most groups and especially activist groups.  Intra-group competition often results in shouty extreme people rising to the top and becoming spokespeople for the movement.  And even though most people in the movement are *not* extremists, it's the leaders who get to set the agenda and they will continue to have that power unless people from within the movement start challenging them.

&gt;The only bigoted feminism I've seen is from extremists, or from idiots and/or teenagers on social media.

Oh right - you don't accept this.  You're using the same argument I've already had repeated to me several times - that my complaints are just to do with teenagers in social media.

They realized that Â£20 divided by six is Â£3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybodyâs share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.

So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each manâs bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.

And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving). The sixth now paid Â£2 instead of Â£3 (33% saving). The seventh now paid Â£5 instead of Â£7 (28% saving). The eighth now paid Â£9 instead of Â£12 (25% saving). The ninth now paid Â£14 instead of Â£18 (22% saving). The tenth now paid Â£49 instead of Â£59 (16% saving).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.

âI only got a pound out of the Â£20 saving,â declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,âbut he got Â£10!â

âYeah, thatâs right,â exclaimed the fifth man. âI only saved a pound too. Itâs unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!â âThatâs true!â shouted the seventh man. âWhy should he get Â£10 back, when I got only Â£2? The wealthy get all the breaks!â

âWait a minute,â yelled the first four men in unison, âwe didnât get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!â

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didnât show up for drinks so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didnât have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!

And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.

If you think there is a fairer way hit me up. 


Time to stop tory bashing for the way the tax system works.
