null,null,LadyLandshark,smith,Smith,null,"Hey, yesterday I was just watching an episode of classic Doctor Who that ties in here! In [The Edge of Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Destruction) (with the first Doctor), there is a malfunction in the TARDIS that causes it to go back in time all the way to the beginning of the universe, and it will continue to keep hurtling back in time until they're all destroyed, if they can't stop it. The Doctor and crew have no clue about what's going on, they only know that for some reason they can't open the TARDIS doors. 

The TARDIS, unknown to it's passengers, starts making strange things happen to let them know what's wrong. Susan and Ian have amnesia, and Susan starts lurking around with a knife trying to stab things, while Ian attempts to strangle the Doctor.

Eventually Barbara figures out that these, along with other things are clues leading to the malfunction, all left by the TARDIS'S security system. They fix the problem and live happily ever after. Yay!

This seemed kind of wierd to me when I first watched it, but this theory actually helps me understand it a little bit. 

In the episode I mentioned, there were a lot of similarities to *Midnight*. A small group of people traveling together starts acting very strangely, become paranoid of each other, and later they find out that there was an outside force making them behave in that way. The theory OP posted says that the force in *Midnight* was a TARDIS, and in *The Edge of Destruction* it WAS a TARDIS. I found it very strange that the TARDIS security system would cause anyone to act so strangely, even violently. In classic Who, I feel like the TARDIS was referred to as a machine, but in more recent years it's become it's own character, even becoming human at one point. Maybe what was called a ""security system"" then, would be called instinct now.

So, (my theory theory) In *Midnight* a TARDIS somehow landed on the empty planet, and while it's exterior dimensions were destroyed, the heart of the TARIDS, along with it's every instinct were left roaming the planet. We've seen the Doctor go stir-crazy when he has to stay in normal time for a while, imagine how that would affect a being that literally was a time machine! *The Edge of Destruction* tells us that a TARDIS, in this situation, can and will do crazy things, in an attempt to let someone know that something has gone wrong. For the theorized TARDIS, everything has gone wrong, it's body is gone, the person driving it is gone, and it probably spent years alone on that planet. A little bit of crazy, with the right surroundings, can become a lot of crazy. So when the Doctor shows up in that vehicle, the TARDIS sees a Time Lord once again, and the old instinct to try and show them that something went wrong comes in. This is an unstable TARDIS core though, and so things may not go exactly as planned.....",null,0,null,1439605125,null,null,false,0,cu3iefi,null,t3_3h0e7p,null,null,null,t3_3h0e7p,null,null,null,1441259461,null,13,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13,null

I'm really hoping this is the case because it would show that Rodgers is maturing in his mindset.  This is precisely what we need to do at the beginning of the season, with several new players, playing away to an opponent who gazumped us at the end of last year.

Having an abortion is fine, but I would say that 2 million per year is a MUCH worse situation than 2 per year. That doesn't seem irrelevant at all. It should be allowed of course, but we should obviously be finding other ways to reduce the number - by better sex education, free contraception etc etc. Obviously it won't be perfect, but it would reduce the numbers from 2 million in your example. Prevention is always going to be better than cure. If you don't want a baby, it's better to try and prevent the pregnancy rather than terminate it once it's occurred.

&gt;No one is going to allowed to force euthanasia any more than they'd be allowed force an abortion.

But people are forced to have abortions all the time. Maybe not an gunpoint, but definitely forced by their social situation, their wealth or health, and pressure from their friends/family, or partner who doesn't want to be a dad. 

And many people DO have abortions because of convenience. Again, that's fine, but it's not ideal.

Same for the right to die. I strongly support it, but we should be examining EVERY other possible answer too, including having serious discussions about end of life care, because it's a massive problem at the moment which nobody really has an answer to.

Hampas' point is that once the option is on the table, more people will use it and it absolutely will be used for convenience. Once you're becoming a burden to your family, or you can't afford care any more, you might go for it. Or, to be honest, your family can start to push the idea - just like we all push our grandmothers out of their house and into a nursing home when it's becoming a pain in the arse to keep going round there because she can't manage alone.

I'm hoping we don't start Lallana on Monday, let him prove himself as a sub and cup matches. He was very wasteful and him playing on the same flank as Gomez is dangerous. If he plays on the right side at least Clyne has a better chance of covering his defensive mistakes. However that takes away from Ibe's development, since we seem to be building him as an out and out winger. 

I want Lallana to come good, but the team (and definitely Rodgers, for his job's sake) need to get off to a good start. I'd like to see a 4-3-3 with Hendo, Milner, and Can in the midfield. Coutinho with Ibe/Firmino on the wings. Most importantly I want 3 points on Monday.

Been to Govinda's a few times - foods ok if you like Indian food, but it's not particularly spicy, and is definitely on the cheap side, so not really recommended.

The one place I would avoid would be Aubergine. The food is a horrible mish-mash of French and Jamaican, the service is poor. The owners - especially the woman - are just horrible.

Yes, but the Doctor's Wife taught us something else, too: a TARDIS's matrix can be separated from the ship, letting the ship be controlled by another being; a fact seemingly unknown to The Doctor until then, but a TARDIS consciousness would probably be fully aware and that's the sort of secret they'd want to *keep* secret as it's a pretty serious weakness.

So a scared TARDIS mind that has been trapped alone on in inescapable planet finally senses a Timelord, it's probably going to assume that there is a second, non-damaged TARDIS nearby, and only intends to ride in a human long enough to get back to our beloved police box and kick Sexy to the curb. It's possible that it has been there since before the Time War and has never actually interacted with humans before, waiting instead for the species it recognizes. It might have thought it could just cripple the transport (knowing from previous experience that a rescue transport would come out eventually), hop into a human and then a timelord, then ride back to the safe zone when the tow truck comes. The fear-driven reactions the humans had in the ship might have been a total surprise.",null,0,null,1439618547,null,null,false,0,cu3oau0,null,t3_3h0e7p,null,null,null,t1_cu3bgb5,null,null,null,1441262238,null,3,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

The grave diggers want to be paid overtime. If they didn't I suspect they'd command a higher average salary to compensate, making everyone's funeral bills higher.

The issue I have is that Payet is better at CAM than on the wings, but I figure we'll keep the same formation for continuity purposes, our striker situation, the formation they've been using, and Zarate's brilliant start. Also love to give Oxford another chance at impressing but might be safer to give Noble the start for this sort of game, Leicester will be approaching it very differently.

Kouyate and Obiang indisputable starters in this formation imo.

Well it's not. There's millions of people out there who would never vote for the any of the 4 candidates.

Remember it wasn't a national free-for-all to select those candidates. They were all existing Labour MPs, nominated by a significant number of other Labour MPs - it's not as if someone who had no connection with the Labour party could have stood (even Liz Kendall has *some* overlap with traditional Labour).

&gt;If you get 500,000 people joining the party all because of 1 leader and he doesn't win, will those people stick around? Probably not. 

That's sort of the point. If you've got a candidate who both represents some aspect of Labour and can attract 500,000 people to the party, then they're probably a better option for leader than one who will chase those 500,000 away. 

If you were talking about huge swathes of people who would never vote Labour joining up simply to make an unelectable candidate leader, then I'd agree. Or if they'd had an entirely open nomination process and the Tories had put Boris Johnson up and flooded the party with people to vote for him.

But that's not what's happening - it's people who have been inspired, or re-inspired, to come to the Labour banner because they buy the message of a candidate who already represents some aspect of the overall Labour political spectrum.

&gt;Better to get the leader first, then get those people in.

For a paddle I'd recommend heading up to Bath and go punting. There's an old Georgian Baths up the river a little way where you can hire punts (or row boats if you prefer) and go up the river. It's really relaxing (assuming you don't fall in!) and after about two hours there's a pub for lunch. Can't remember exactly where it is but just google punting in Bath and you'll find it. 

For the weekend, hire a two person canal boat in the Bristol docks and go to Bath and back up the Kennet and Avon canal. It takes two to three days (depending on how many pubs you stop at) and there are plenty of locks to stop and open along the way. The boats have a bed and small kitchen and are easy enough to steer and the boat people will help you get out of the docks so you can get used to the handling.

If your costs of production are higher than the price you get for your product, the market is signalling to you to get out of the business.

The current milk market is characterised by over supply - some people need to get out of the business.

I watched an interview on channel 4 news with a new 20 year old dairy farmer complaining about the price and how it was going to put her out of business. The simple fact is that she made a poor decision to enter an unprofitable market.

(sorry mobile) 

Essentially, if someone else's property is on your land then you must contact them formally (I.e. Via a signed for letter) informing them that they must collect their property within a certain (reasonable) time frame or it'll be binned/sold (to another scaffolding company perhaps) 

This is all set out in the The Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. Which I do not believe is specific to landlords but more the situation above in general.

It's mentioned early on that the usual tour path was blocked by a rock/diamond slide, and the truck's nav system charted a new route.  When the Doctor visits the cockpit, he mentions to the drivers that they're the first people to ever see the location they're at now, and when they open the viewscreen to look outside one of them sees movement of the entity.  

I don't think the creature was a TARDIS, but I think it's pretty clear that the Time Lords were responsible for imprisoning it in a place where nothing with a physical body could survive and no one could escape.  

There are a lot of monsters the Doctor fights that are a direct result of some ancient, pre-Time Lord evil that is starting to return to the universe now that Gallifrey is gone.  There's the Beast in the Satan Pit, who was imprisoned by some ancient force at the start of the universe, there are the witches/Carrionites from the Shakespeare Code, the Racnoss spider woman from the Runaway Bride, and probably others I'm forgetting.  Some ancient force (probably the Time Lords) cleaned up a lot of nasty stuff in the early universe, and after they were gone a lot of stuff started to creep back in.  Seeing the Doctor cope with the vacuum created by the end of the Time War was a neat angle that was never explicitly spelled out, but there was a lot of story potential there.

The £10 cost for curtains.

Some of this will be labour.
Some of this will be material.
Some of this will be overheads and costs you will incur **even if you stop producing**. This might be rent, business rates, leases on machinery etc.

If you stop producing your labour and material cost drop to £0. But this doesn't mean the rent stops or the business rates or standing charges or leasing or machinery and other costs. A lot of residential rental contracts don't let you leave on a whim. Commercial property contracts often lock you in for years, business rates do not stop either if you stop producing. Labour and materials are often a small component of the total costs.

So you make curtains and sell them for £8, you lose £2.

If you stop producing? Now you have no income which to offset against those overheads yet those overheads continue. So you do a calculation how much are my overheads vs losses? If you stop producing and lose more than £2.01 then it makes sense to continue producing.

From what i can find about Mr Salah,he is considered by some the Palestinian Ghandi, his ""crimes"" include raising funds for Hamas,he is said to have cast doubt on Osama Bin Laden's culpability for 9/11, suggesting instead the attacks were an Israeli plot,and hes not a fan of the gays.The main reason i think he is considered a hate preacher is because of his views on Israels occupation of Palestine,which i think a lot of people have an issue with.To me it looks like a case of Mr Corbryn standing by his beliefs.

null,null,pmyteh,null,null,null,"Nationalising energy companies would indeed be really expensive. Nationalising rail would essentially be free. Since the Conservatives accidentally nationalised Network Rail (the major part of the railway system with actual fixed assets), there are three significant chunks left.

The first is the rolling stock owning companies (ROSCOs) which actually own the trains and lease them to the operating companies. I'm not a fan of the ROSCOs, as they create inter-party risk (and therefore risk premium payments) which in the BR era didn't exist - stock was bought outright and the residual value risk was dealt with by planned cascading - but they'll happily supply NewBR with train leases on the same terms as they do the current operating companies. So we can leave them alone (and maybe stop using them to fund new trains).

The second are the various freight operators. We actually have one of those nationalised already (DRS is a subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority) but they operate in a fairly competitive market, which market is guaranteed by the various EU Railway Packages, so there's probably little point in scooping them back up.

The third, which is the one people are usually talking about when discussing rail nationalisation, are the train operating companies (TOCs). These have two interesting properties: They are very thinly capitalised shell companies, which don't actually own anything. Virgin East Coast, for example, is a special purpose company majority held by Stagecoach (the bus company). It's not run by Virgin or Stagecoach themselves. The second, is that their only substantial asset is the franchise given by government to run the trains, which is time-limited by design (traditionally for seven years, though it varies). When the franchise is up, the special purpose company is basically worth nothing. Oh, and the public sector already has a TOC as well: Directly Operated Railways is used as the franchisee of last resort in the case of franchise failure and was until recently running the East Coast line.

So here's the cost-free route to rail nationalisation: You wait until the franchises are up. Then you don't renew them - simply put them in the hands of DOR. All the passenger-facing parts of the operating railway are then in public hands except the trains themselves, which are effectively on a finance lease (as with much of the rest of the public sector). No compensation, because no compensation is due for not renewing a franchise and the SPVs basically have no value once the franchise is complete.

Tl;dr: The structure of railway privatisation is agreed by essentially everyone to be stupid, but it does allow free re-nationalisation of the operating companies.",null,0,null,1439633668,null,null,false,0,cu3s19c,null,t3_3gyzuj,null,null,null,t1_cu3fv0k,null,null,null,1441264062,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

null,null,capnza,southafrica,South Africa,null,"&gt;No, because it assumes that everyone wants to do everything, and everyone is capable of doing everything.

Why is this a bad assumption?

&gt;Equality of opportunity allows anyone to try, and people who are suitable to succeed. It's actually fair, and empowers people to make a choice, and be rewarded for their efforts.

I'm not opposed to equality of opportunity at all. I just don't think it exists at the moment. Further to which, how can we tell if it exists or not?

&gt;Equality of outcome allows anyone to try, but fixes the result, rejecting people because of unrelated characteristics in order to balance the result and appear fair. And you only appear fair to people who put stock in those characteristics as a representation of a person's identity.

See, you are missing the point a little here. People don't all start from the same point in life. What if we currently have a society where women or black people find it relatively more difficult to succeed for reasons beyond their control? Why is it such a terrible thing for us to jimmy the outcome a little so that we make sure that women and minorities are represented in proportion?

There is no fairness in the world other than that which we make for ourselves.

&gt;I'm very tall. This has nothing to do with the job I do, and you shouldn't need tall people in a job to encourage tall people to take a job that doesn't need you to be tall to do the job.

I think tallness is a silly example, and I think you know it too. Are you a white man? I am, and I know exactly how hard it is for white men to udnerstand that women or black people don't go through life being treated the same way a white man does. I was also born into quite a wealthy family, and it took me a long time to understand how much of a headstart I had over a poor, black, woman who might have the same goals as me. Why should we just let the ingrained injustices in the world perpetuate themselves, where rich white guys like me have a headstart over poor black women forever?

I know for a lot of the teachers it's 50/50 if they like it or not, but I don't have too much experience on that side of it. 

But our school was failing being run by the government, and when Ark came in, the school increased dramatically. I have been given so many more opportunities under the academy, they have the money to fund trips out of school to support myself and my class. 

They also have the money to be able to expel students. I don't know how many of you are aware but it costs a lot of money to expel a student, and our school was not willing to do it under the government. Ark do not hesitate. 

They also provide bursaries to the less well off students, to aid them in school costs. So anyone spouting out the typical Tory middle class stuff is wrong, at least in my college.

Even in Greece where they did vote for a far-left country, their leader chose the capitalist route of remaining in the EU over the freedom that would have come from having their own currency and having more control over monetary policy.

For socialism to be credible you have to prove it works to people.  This means doing it gradually, little by little, and choosing things with the best chance of success. In the US Obama managed to get his healthcare reforms through, even though they go far short of what every other developed nation has (free healthcare) he should be congratulated for at least making things a little better in the face of fierce opposition.

Corbyn's plans will be considered too radical by the electorate unless they feel the Conservatives are doing an appalling job. And the fact Cameron just increased his share of the vote 3 months ago suggests that's not the case at the moment.

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"The problem with most logical fallacies in the context of normal debate (i.e. not philosophical arguments, but the interactions real people have) is that most of them are simply the consequence of not having expanded the argument enough.

If I say ""Kendall should lead us into the general election because I think she will be best at winning Tory votes"", that's a perfectly valid and logical statement. The problem is it seems to suffer from a whole bunch of fallacies (begging the question, appeal to consequence, possibly circular reasoning). That's not because the logic is flawed, but because most of the argument hasn't been said (the *why* she is better at winning votes, and *why* that's the most important thing for a Labour leader). Since we don't expect people to type out an entire essay-length argument every time they make a comment, dismissing the shorthand version for being ""fallacious"" isn't helpful.

Which is why the ""fallacy fallacy"" is a thing. Just because you think a statement is victim to a fallacy, doesn't mean the argument isn't correct.

Ditto things like ""appeal to authority"" and ""fallacy of chronology"" (that new ideas are by default better than old ideas). While in philosophical logical terms these are definitely fallacies, it doesn't mean they should be dismissed in ""real life"" debates. If 90% of all the people who have ever been involved in fighting a winning election campaign all say the same thing, it is still technically an ""appeal to authority"" fallacy to use this as reason to vote one way.

Second year uni student house, I was the first to move in so I got the internet sorted out. Anyway when we left I gave them notice and was assured by the call centre that I didn't need to pay anything else and could cancel my direct debit. So I did.

Like a year later I try to get a sofa on interest free credit and get declined. Seriously who gets declined for a sofa? Ran a credit check and it turned out VM tried to bill me after I'd cancelled, then sent collectors after me, then recorded a default. I had one rude, unhelpful call centre drone after another basically telling me it wasn't their problem. Hours and hours wasted. It's the kind of stuff that sends people postal. Eventually I found the e-mail address for the CEO, put the story down in rage, and had a call from his office within the day promising to fix everything. Even then I had to put things in writing to some office, who eventually fixed my credit rating a full six months after I first noticed the problem.

I had half a mind to take them to a small claims court for the inconvenience. 

Plus their network is terrible, 50/50 chance that your service won't be fit for purpose. Just fuck Virgin Media.

Hi there, I'm selling a Parvum S2.0 Case in Black/Red. This is the mATX version.  

The case is in excellent condition, but has a small crack in the front accent (Has been repaired and can't be seen when the front panel is on, and there's a small mark inside the front panel). The bottom panel also has 4 holes that I drilled to mount my DDC pump. Case may also have scratches here and there, as there's a lot of sharp corners in this case so some stuff scratched easy. Window panel is in excellent condition, no scratches. The case is in overall great condition, fantastic case too.

The crack doesn't affect the mounting of a radiator or fans, and once assembled you wouldn't know they where there.  

Comes with all screws and mounting cubes, vandal switch (white LED), IO cable and front USB 3 cable.  

Case will be sent disassembled, but it's simple to assemble.  

Price £70 Posted.

I had their broadband for a month.  It was crap.  Huge packet loss, slow.  Their support was basically 'if you can see Google it's working'.

I rung up to find out what termination fees they had.  Call centre claimed their didn't have that information and hung up.

Tried again a couple of days later - first employee had started cancellation and *added a £500 cancellation fee*  without my permission.  They had no authority to reverse it apparently.

I had to escalate it in writing before I got anyone with the power to change it - and the best they could do was put me on broadband 's' for 12 months (which apparently exists although it was never advertised) and I had to keep the phone line too.

I've no idea why companies behave like this.  If I was in the middle of nowhere with no broadband and someone offered me VM for 50p a month I'd turn it down rather than deal with them again.

No, Labour has the possibility of getting into power under Burnham or Cooper, both have put forward good reasons for leadership and I feel potential for being PM although Cooper has started to shoot herself in the foot.

Under Corbyn, Labour won't get in as he's too far to the Left. After going through Blair, Brown and now Cameron, England wants someone that's near the Centre with strong economic policies and good social policies although Cameron is fucking that up at the moment but keeping good on the economic side.

Personally I wouldn't be opposed to Blair coming back and making a run for PM, he lost his position as Middle East Quartet Representative so he must have some free time and if Corbyn gets elected then screws up, he could come back as the Lord and Saviour of the Labour Party, much like Sarkozy is doing for l'UMP or Republicans as it's now known.

In the end, Burnham or Cooper will leave Labour less fucked and possibly in power compared to what Corbyn can do, long term.",null,0,null,1439638653,null,null,false,0,cu3t448,null,t3_3h2vmx,null,null,null,t3_3h2vmx,null,null,null,1441264570,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

That's probably not the best news for us, considering a lot of people blamed our election defeat on ""lazy Labour voters"" staying at home.

And remember, just because someone says they'll turn out to vote now doesn't mean they will. People who answer ""I am definitely going to vote"" in polls is always way higher than the proportion of people who actually vote.

Now you could say all Labour needs to worry about is the 'more likely' people since it doesn't matter if they turn Conservative voters into even more Conservative voters. However, it does show a lot of Conservative voters are put off by Corbyn.

Anyway, going back to my original point, it would have been good if there was a question:

If the public disagree with the trade deal, or parts of it, it means it's much easier to agree a trade deal, but that might not be what the public actually wanted. 

So yes I have studied game theory and I'm aware of what you're talking about, and keeping it secret does mean it's easier to reach an agreement. However, it does not take into account whether the agreement should be made in the first place, and that by agreeing such a deal politicians won't be doing their job. 

It's is far more complex than the simple game you're describing because if the deal had a negative impact on the country and the population if the deal is done I'm secret and contains unpopular as nd unwanted clauses, then securing the deal may not actually be the best outcome. It might be better for the deal to fall through.

The member states have already said what they wanted and what they didn't want (they created the mandate for the negotiations after all), and it's up to negotiators to read the political mood and to negotiate with that in mind.",null,1,null,1439640088,null,null,false,0,cu3tgoe,null,t3_3h2wdr,null,null,null,t1_cu3tezq,null,null,null,1441264802,null,8,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

I do like the fact she wants to focus on early years education which I feel isn't given the attention it deserves, we all focus on secondary or uni but not early years which is crucial for child development but she does need to expand more on the policy and how she would go about it.

She also wants Wealth Creation as well as Wealth Distribution which is good but again, how?

The press and the Tories have been holding fire  - the old saying goes ""Don't interupt your enemy while he's making a mistake"". Once Corbyn is leader all hell will break loose.

There's plenty that will make decent people positively *shudder* before voting for him. Here's one example:

Five people were killed in the Brighton bomb including Members of Parliament and spouses of Members of Parliament. And just two weeks later Corbyn invited the IRA *to Parliament*. It was like rubbing salt in the wounds of the bereaved to take the murderers into *Parliament* where the dead people worked. He's spinning it now as ""he was trying to negotiate peace"" - but he was not only in opposition, he was a backbencher, he wasn't in a position to negotiate anything. The whole purpose of the invite was to gleefully taunt the Conservatives and the families of the people who got killed. He was taking *pleasure* in their pain.

If you were in his shoes would you have done the same? Or would you have thought, this isn't the time or place, even if I want negotiations to take place? 

Blair negotiated while bombs were going off, but he was super careful to make clear to the bereaved that he wasn't trying to hurt them, he did it in as sensitive a way as possible. A world away from Corbyn's gleeful behaviour.

If he was PM and ISIS killed Brits, would Corbyn go, ""Yeah, you deserved it, you are their oppressors""? *Shudder*. The man is totally unfit to be leader of the Labour party let alone PM. 

This is going to be such a horror fest once it gets going and *the whole party* will be branded as terrorists and cuckoos within - unless like Chuka and Tristram Hunt they are *explicit* in making clear they oppose Corbyn's madness from the get-go.",null,0,null,1439641725,null,null,1439642089,0,cu3twde,null,t3_3h2vmx,null,null,null,t1_cu3t5sg,null,null,null,1441265007,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"&gt;Am I right in saying the franchises are bid on, correct? And the money goes to the government? So if there's no bid, that's a loss of revenue for the government?

Yes and no. Yes in that there is a bidding/payment element, but no in that the government also provides large subsidies as a matter of course. Most franchises are won not on the basis of ""who pays the government the most"" but ""who needs the least in subsidies"".

DOR actually made a profit for the government- one of the only franchisees to ever do so. That is, they actually paid more to the government as profits than they took in subsidies. No other major franchise had managed that.

Re: your other (very good) points, that's why I'm a big fan of Miliband's policy (which lives on with Burnham) of making DOR bid for franchises alongside private operators. Wherever private companies can genuinely offer better value they will win and rightly be allowed to continue. Where DOR offers better, of course they should run it. Why shouldn't they?

I'd imagine such contests will largely come down to DOR being able to return 100% profit to the Treasury (in their favour) vs private companies having access to more investment cash for infrastructure upgrades (in theirs).

&gt;If Mr Corbyn is not to be regarded from the day of his election as an enemy of Britain’s Jewish community, he has a number of questions which he must answer in full and immediately. The JC asked him earlier this week to respond. No response has been forthcoming.

&gt;1. Did you donate, as alleged by its founder, to Deir Yassin Remembered (DYR), a group that publishes open antisemitism, run by Holocaust denier Paul Eisen — an organisation so extreme that even the Palestine Solidarity Campaign refuses to associate with it?

&gt;2. Have you, as Mr Eisen claims, regularly attended DYR’s annual conference?

&gt;3. Why have you accepted an invitation to appear at a conference on August 22 alongside Carlos Latuff, the notorious anti-Semitic cartoonist?

&gt;4. Why did you write to the Church of England authorities to defend Rev Stephen Sizer, a vicar banned from social media because of his habit of posting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, telling them that Rev Sizer was “under attack” because he had “dared to speak out over Zionism”?

&gt;5. Why do you associate with Hamas and Hezbollah and refer to them as your “friends”?

&gt;6. Why have you failed to condemn the anti-Semitic posters and banners that dominate the annual Al-Quds Day rally, sponsored by the Stop The War Coalition, which you chair?

&gt;7. Why did you describe Raead Salah, a man convicted of the blood libel, as an ‘honoured citizen’?

Edit:  Downvoted, because Corbyn supporters don't care about antisemitism.

However my issue with him on flip flopping isn't so much him changing his mind, but him being scared by polls and running from one policy to the other. A man who does that is a follower, not a leader, and while in a democracy you should do what people want, you should also be willing to do the right thing and convince people your actions are the right way to go. It's working for Corbyn, and its worked in the past. The NHS met massive opposition, but Bevan fought for what was right and its now one of the greatest things about this country. We can do things like that again, we just need someone willing to do it.

NATO is a Cold war relic. It needs reform if not abolition and replacement, and if you think it's made us safer, engaging in ""multilateral action"" that's destabilised countries from Libya to Iraq, then I heartily disagree. As for nuclear weapons, perhaps the electorate will want to keep them and  maybe he'll have to compromise, but its almost £100bn of expenditure in total and with this economic deficit its really not worth it. The idea they keep us safer is a fallacy, as demonstrated by the over 150 other countries who feel safer without them, many of which could manufacture them if they so desired. Furthermore, who are we gonna nuke? Rational actors, countries that have interests against ours, wouldn't want to cost us that many civilians, and would realise it would ruin them diplomatically and economically. Terrorists cannot be nuked in retaliation. And if someone like Putin nuked London, it is simply unethical for us to nuke Moscow back. We shouldn't be in the business of considering civilian deaths on that magnitude retaliatory collateral, it demonstrates a reckless disregard for human life. Multilateral disarmament is needed for sure, but if you're the sort of person who thinks Britain has a leading role on the world stage, then we should lead the way on this, otherwise it might never happen.",null,0,null,1439643721,null,null,false,0,cu3ugv5,null,t3_3gulrg,null,null,null,t1_cu3s3k1,null,null,null,1441265276,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

You asked why there are neo-nazis here now, and the answer is simple: people are seeing unwelcome changes in the social demographics where they live, they are seeing foreign cultures take root and are clashing with them.

I hope I've helped show a little of why nazism might be coming about.

The club signed him to a long-term contract, and now don't want to play him (or, indeed, let him train with the rest of the squad) even though he's available . What's he supposed to do, give up his wages because Brendan doesn't want him anymore? Fuck that. He's said he'd be willing to leave if the right offer came along, but he doesn't owe it to anyone to walk away from what the club legally owe him. If the club are so eager for him (and Borini, and Balotelli) to go, why aren't they buying them out of their contracts? Why the fuck do the players need to be the ones taking a loss? Fuck that.

When players like Sterling ditch us for more money, they're money grubbers. When players want to stay but the manager doesn't want them, they're money grubbers. With that attitude (""we want you to be loyal, but only if we think you're worth it"") why would anyone want to play for us?

It's not Brendan not wanting them that bothers me. It's the ostracizing. He wants them to find other clubs, but he won't give them the opportunity to attract outside interest. He just expects them to train alone and somehow magick deals out thin air, or to accept the first lowball offer they get.

I am sorry if this is some kind of soap box for you, but this character happens to be male, a male who showed great relief at not being ""a girl"" (Matt Smith's first episode).  Not everything in life is about gay rights or gender rights or trans rights.  This is about a character that has been male for over 50 years in real life and over 2,000 years in HIS fictional universe.

Bring back Romana as President of the High Council, or as a companion, sure.  No need to change The Doctor's gender.  He spent an ENTIRE LIFETIME as a male and seems comfortable starting his new regeneration cycle as a male as well.

Calling out anyone who wants The Doctor to remain male as homophobic or racist is a very strawman argument.  One thing has nothing to do with the other.  I'd welcome a black doctor...and as for gay, it doesn't get gayer than John Pertwee's outfits.

I had a friend at uni who wasn't so good at accounting, opened several student accounts by transferring the money around them when he got his loan in so it looked like he only had 1. He then proceeded to max out almost all of them and they found out at the same time he was breaking the rules.

This worked until one term I forgot to do it. Natwest dragged me in, I admitted what I'd been doing and they immediately cancelled my overdraft arrangement meaning I was suddenly paying loads in fees. In hindsight, probably not worth the extra free rail pass!

I don't see any real evidence for this.

I think I can say that as a programmer.

My feeling and experience is that about 5-15% of men are interested and suited for these subjects and that this is even less amongst women - maybe as low as 1-5%.

It's my birthday today, and this was about as good of a present as it gets.

Howard had a very solid game in goal. Made two very good saves, and commanded his box well.

The defense was a little shaky to start with, but a clean sheet away from home against Southampton is huge.  We got lucky on a couple corners where we gave them free headers, but at the end of the day, the clean sheet is all that matters.

Barry and McCarthy both had really solid games.  Won the ball well, kept it well, and kept the team going. 

Ross and Cleverley were both outstanding. They both missed a simple chance to score, but Ross made up for it with a goal and an assist, and Cleverely put himself about with authority. It looks like he's really settling into the team.

A great game up top for both Rom and Arouna ""I'm actually pretty good after all"" Kone. Wonderful cross for Rom's first, had good control, held the ball well, and won lots of first and second balls. I really hope he keeps this up, and I hope our previous criticism was unwarranted. Rom played out of his skin today. That header was absolutely world class, and a great job to win the ball for the second with a clinical first-touch finish.

All around great performance from the lads, and again Martinez proves his tactical flexibility. Very, very good performance, let's hope we kick on against City next weekend.

If the next party elected after a TTIP deal were passed wanted to renegotiate it, as a sovereign government they could.  There might be some repercussions or compensation, but they could do it.   

If a government in political union with the EU wanted to renegotiate TTIP it would first have to convince 27 other member states, any of whom would be able to block renegotiation.      

And the people passing something like TTIP would be held much more accountable at the ballot box through an independent government, whereas through the EU it's very much seen as their baby with national governments going along and making compromises with the needs and requirements of the other 27.   

So much easier, and so much scope for it being personally tailored negotiated 1:1.

Hold them more accountable and it'd be much more akin to a straight forward free trade deal, like Iceland negotiated with China.

Lukaku got his second from a classic Lukaku position, but his first was rare. He has been critisised for his heading time and again, but he timed this to perfection- and was a one that Shearer would have been proud of. 

He also worked well linking up, he turned his man a number of times and created for himself after receiving the ball with his back to goal. There was one move relatively late on where he left 2 defenders for dead doing this; something I haven't seen in an Everton shirt since Yak was at his best. 

Barkley also looked smart. His problem was always trying to do too much, but for some reason today he managed to pick out the simple passes and really drag defenders in before exposing them. His tekkers were always there, but this was a major issue. The more pleasing moment I saw from him was the simple pass he played to Kone on the right before the opener. He drew the play in, saw the run from Kone and played a delightful, smart, technically difficult pass right into his run.

Seen a lot of excuses thrown around, like the loss of Schneiderlin, injuries of Bertrand etc, Europa league fatigue. But honestly the blame lies mostly with Koeman.

I don't know how he can justify lining up in the same way as last week where we made Newcastle look like world beaters and needed 2 goals for just 1 point. If we carry on playing in a way that needs a minimum of 3 goals to get a win then we're not going to win many games at all. 

Out of 4 attackers only one of them showed any interest in providing width which was Tadic and he only did so to the extent of trying to cross from deep. Mane and Long make good runs but if we're going to play them both one of them needs stay more position focussed.

Davis doesn't have the discipline or abilities to play alongside Wanyama, he seems to escape criticism because of some good last ditch tackles and blocks but if he was doing his job properly he wouldn't need to be making them. I like the guy and he was ok in the second half but he's got absolutely no place starting as one of the 2 defensive mids. Especially now Wanyama seems to have adopted a more attacking box-to-box approach.

None of the defenders looked convincing today, Yoshida was back at his old game of being drawn toward the ball too easily and Fonte made some ill advised leaps out of defence too. But much like last week I'd but that mainly down to the fact that they were constantly having to face 3 or more attackers running at them virtually unimpeded. If the team was properly balanced and they had better shielding that back 4 is going to be ok most of the time, VVD wouldn't have fixed that mess in the first half.

Cedric and Targett needed to show some common sense in the first half, we were barely clinging on and still they were both charging up the touchline like we were in control of the match. I get it might be their instructions and Cedric doesn't need much encouragement but when Everton were looking to go on the break and our forwards had absolutely 0 ball retention they should have the awareness to stay put.

On the brightside we looked much more like our usual selves in the second half. Everton took their foot off which will have played a part in that but Romeu actually staying back proving a passing outlet and a speed bump for counter attacks gave us more structure. I just hope Koeman has received the message from the last 2 weeks that what works against the likes of Vitesse won't work in the premier league.",null,0,null,1439647179,null,null,false,0,cu3vn0a,null,t3_3h3eqm,null,null,null,t3_3h3eqm,null,null,null,1441265827,null,4,null,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,4,null

Exams are also notorious for encouraging rote memorisation where students simply forget everything ten minutes after leaving the hall.

 I thought Howard done really well and you all know how much I don't like him so that's saying something. Some really good saves and he looked reliable throughout. Jags and Stones were immense. Chelsea can fuck right off if they think they're getting Stones no chance. I thought Coleman looked a bit lost at times and seems to be in a bit of bad form at the moment but he done really well in the second half with getting forward and defending. Galloway was class to be quite honest. He's no where near the attacking threat of Baines but not many players are and he dealt with their attacks superbly especially going up against Manè and Pellè who trouble the whole league. Looks a great prospect and we'll see how long before he's trusted at centre back as that's where Martinez sees him in the future. 

Barry done alright and moved the ball well but he is lacking in pace which was especially shown when they were trying to run at us. Definitely still a good player but can't play every game like last season. McCarthy was McCarthy really and just tried to get everywhere. He didn't have as big an impact today but he still passed a few important balls and intercepted some too. I thought Cleverley looked poor at times today honestly but he done really well for most of the game when you take into consideration he is being played out of position. I still think he's going to be a good player for us like Osman, not great but when you need him he's certainly reliable. 

Of course can't not mention our diamond called Ross Barkley. The lad is in great form recently I mean he's already matched his stats from last season with goals and assists and we're two games into the season. That in itself is more of a showing that he was really poor last season though but I hope we'll just be able to chalk that down to second season syndrome and he'll kick on this year and fulfil his potential for us. Great assist and a great goal too, probably should've scored earlier on but still an amazing performance. Kone I must say was great. Good hold up play and passing while also getting in good positions and taking some of the defence away from Rom. Fantastic assist and you can't fault him on his defending in the first half which he did improve on as he is a striker and he's not used to defending. Lastly the easy MOTM Rom. Probably one of his best performances for us since he's joined permanently certainly in the premier league. He just used his power and pace to just bully their defenders at times and I was hoping he'd get his hattrick and he probably could've but he chose the unselfish options which is great in a player. Hope to see many more from him this season and hopefully he'll be up there with the top scorers. Also at only 22 he's entered into the top 100 scorers in premier league history. That's an amazing achievement. 

All in all it was a great performance and I hope we get a signing or two during the week because we'll need to be very good to beat City or even get points off of them depending on their form. Hoping for a good result though and this is a great way to start this tough run of games coming up.

Oh! It's a defective X-chromosome, in fact, that causes it. Her daughter, Alice, princess of Saxe-Coburg, had a daughter, Alexandra, who was the Tsarina of Russia. And many people believe it precipitated the Russian revolution, the fact that therefore her son, the Tsesarevich, Alexei, was, therefore, a haemophiliac.

I made this comment last year about our problems, and I think you hit the nail on the head with how we are different this year:

&gt;At our best [2 years back] when we were very much a 'gameplan specific' team- in that we would have a plan of action to exploit weaknesses in the opposition, and would be pretty bold in it's execution (for example playing Lukaku on the wing vs Arsenal threw them right off and worked wonderfully). With 1 day to train after a Euro match (especially if travel was involved), we are just unable to execute this fully.

I don't think it was tiredness or lack of depth that caused our problems in the league, it was the lack of time the staff had to spend working on specific 'moments' designed to work one week, then not get implemented again until the scenario came up again. 

We saw this week that we had changed the way we played dramatically, and it exposed a very, very good team time and again. Remember that this a good team, with a good manager who would have looked at us and tried to exploit our weaknesses.. But we threw the gameplan they expected out of the window and it meant what they had trained all week was probably useless. 

Under Moyes he would have looked at that Newcastle game that The Saints played, but still came out exactly the same as ever. He worked amazingly with a rigid team- it meant mediocre players shone, because they did the same thing week in week out without much variation... But it made us very predictable. We were hard to break down, but good teams would usually pull something out the bag against us (which is why we never went to big teams, other than City and won). 

This is not a criticism of Moyes, or a knee jerk 'Martinez is always right', but more an illustration of the difference. We worked well in Europe (largely) under Moyes because we weren't coming out with different styles and tactics... I just hope that Martinez can find a balance, once the cup runs start this year.",null,0,null,1439647560,null,null,false,0,cu3vs54,null,t3_3h3f0q,null,null,null,t1_cu3vh1v,null,null,null,1441265895,null,23,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,23,null

The worst home display I've seen since we were knocked out of the JPT by Swindon Town after Pardew was sacked. Absolutely woeful performance. The players were really absent. They made a bang average side look amazing. The pundits are now raving over Ross Barkley. ROSS BARKLEY! We made that one dimensional player look like a world beater thanks to a completely empty (Schneiderlin shaped) hole in midfield.  



Here's my ratings if anyone cares.   
Stek - Let in 3 goals. Fine apart from that.  
Cedric - Got forward a lot. That's about it.  
Fonte - Lost his head towards the end. Looked furious with his defence.  
Yoshida - Completely bullied by Lukaku. Dreadful performance from a player who has greatly improved recently.  
Targett - Injured early on any never replaced. Scared to go forward after that in case he couldn't get back.  
Davis - Nothing of note. Didn't link up with attack really.  
Tadic - Just awful. Has been for too long.  
Wanyama - Strong on the ball. Some awful passing.  
Mané - Ineffective. Some good runs but had his head down.  
Long - See above.  
Pellè - Held up the ball well. Ineffective still. His conversion rate is depressingly bad.  

Romeu - Filled that hole to an extent. Booked within 2 minutes.  
Ward - Prowse - Someone to take corners so Pellè can not score from them.  
Rodriguez - Did he actually play?",null,1,null,1439647693,null,null,false,0,cu3vu0q,null,t3_3h3eqm,null,null,null,t3_3h3eqm,null,null,null,1441265919,null,-1,null,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,-1,null

In the UK, most people seem to really enjoy putting people in their place and having a power trip whenever they can. If there's someone who isn't as fortunate as them in terms of education, speech or income - we look down on them and likely will never change our perception of that person. If there's someone on an equal footing, we try to one up them. The middle classes are the worst for this ie: ""I shop at Waitrose"" or ""Philippa dearest, could you please kindly pass me the pink himalayan salt?"" and they spend silly amounts on things like Range Rovers. If someone is more successful than them, we try to pull them down or deride them behind their backs. And gleefully celebrate if they fall - though we keep a straight face - though you can usually tell if its along the lines of ""oh well, some things *just aren't meant to be*, are they?!

In Australia, there isn't really a hierarchy - just a bunch of individuals going about their day. In the US, there's definitely a money divide but poor people aren't looked down upon, just pitied.

It's not 'difficult' because you're simplifying it down to such a barebones description it's irrelevant to how the negotiations are actually done. 

A large economic block like the EU can reach a better deal than a smaller economy like the UK can reach on it's own when dealing with a large block such as the USA. It has more bargaining power and more positions to trade and compromise on. This is not a difficult concept to grasp.

The additional funding and the specialised funding hits the nail on the head. Conservatives and Labour wants the same thing: UK to be prosperous. Labour wants equal opportunities for all so people can grow in a direction of their choosing. Conservatives wants early specialisation.

Both options offer benefits and downsides.

It may increase social mobility but it can lead to a generation of people without the right skills for the job market.

First Half

MIN |  | Event |  | Player | | Description
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
||
1'  || Misc || Eriksen || [An early and nifty bit of skill by Eriksen to beat one man, but he can't beat the second.](http://gfycat.com/MeaslyUnsteadyHartebeest)
8' || Yellow || Whelan || [A nice give-and-go by Dier seems him fouled on the return pass just before entering the Stoke box.](http://gfycat.com/KindlyAdmiredAlleycat)
9' || Chance for Spurs || Eriksen || [The ensuing free kick is taken by Eriksen and saved smartly by Butland, who handles the short hop and pushes it out for a corner.](http://gfycat.com/SkeletalAntiqueEgret)
12' || Chance for Stoke || Diouf || [Lloris with a horrible mistake turns the ball over just inside the box. He saves the first shot, and Mason makes a crucial (and painful) block on the second shot.](http://gfycat.com/BiodegradableScratchyFrog)
19' || GOAL (1-0) || Dier || [A corner following a deflected Mason shot sees Eriksen's delivery meet Dier's head, and opens up Tottenham's account for the 2015-2016 season](http://gfycat.com/DelightfulClearcutBrahmanbull). [Alternate angles](http://gfycat.com/ShockedWindingFiddlercrab)
23' || Yellow || Walker || [Arnautovic skins Walker, who commits a professional foul and is shown a yellow.](http://gfycat.com/EmotionalImmaterialAnnelid)
37' || Chance for Spurs || Eriksen || [Christian Eriksen cuts out a pass deep inside the defensive area, turns, and unleashes an absolutely brilliant over-the-top pass to a streaking Nacer Chadli. Chadli's touch is too heavy though, and Butland cleans it up without any difficulty.](http://gfycat.com/DefenselessShortBass)
44' || Chance for Stoke || Diouf || [Walker is dispossessed due to a good Stoke press, and a cross into the box sees Stoke play some head tennis. The ball ends up at Diouf who wastes a great chance by heading it straight into a thankful Lloris.](http://gfycat.com/BriefClearAmericancrayfish)
45'+1 || Chance for Spurs || Mason || [An excellent ball from Kane finds Mason, whose decent shot is saved by an outstretched Butland's foot.](http://gfycat.com/PastPleasingGnat) 
45'+2 || GOAL (2-0) || Chadli || [A looping Kane ball finds Davies running down the flank late in the half. He makes the only pass he can and it finds a dolphin at the far post. 2-0 Spurs off the deflected shot](http://gfycat.com/PoliticalGiganticAustralianshelduck). [Alternate angles](http://gfycat.com/SlimyBeautifulHoneybadger).

48' || Yellow || Davies || [Davies is late on a tackle against Walters. Deserved yellow.](http://gfycat.com/CautiousSimpleBeagle)
52' || Chance for Spurs || Kane || [After Dier wins another midfield 50/50 ball, Chadli beats his man, patiently waits, and delivers a great, late, ball into Kane who just can't put it past Butland at close range. He should have scored there.](http://gfycat.com/DiligentPopularKillifish)

Finishing in general was wank today.

Midfield was okay controlling possession, but it doesn't matter how much of the ball you control if you don't fucking do anything with it. Long didn't really contribute much and was lost on the wing, J-Rod had little to no impact when he came on as well.

Compromise between the UK and the USA will be heavily weighted to the USA as has been shown in every other interaction the two nations have had in the past century alone.

So much like how any trade deal made by the EU will be heavily weighted towards Germany? As has been shown time and time again. Even if a deal is weighted towards the US it would be far more favourable to the UK if it was negotiated by the UK government. You are living in a fantasy world if you think that the EU would put as much effort into securing a deal which looked after the UKs interests as our own leaders.

&gt;A large economic block like the EU can reach a better deal than a smaller economy like the UK can reach on it's own when dealing with a large block such as the USA. It has more bargaining power and more positions to trade and compromise on. This is not a difficult concept to grasp.

The EU has failed as a large economic bloc. Attempting to treat it as a homogenous economic area is the reason why it has literally zero percent growth.

This was all tactics and injuries in my book, of which only one was injured in European play (and re injured himself with the u21s so it wouldn't have mattered). 

Davis was a passenger, which was especially disappointing after how well I thought he played last week. Him and Vic do not have the same understanding that Morgan and Vic did, which is painfully obvious when both midfielders are pushing up and spreading wide I'd expect at least one to figure out what's going on and step back into the middle to protect the defense. And notice how I said ""both midfielders"" up there? Tadic isn't one and will never be one, and even though I do rate him putting him in the hole is no solution to only playing Vic and Davis in the defensive spots. We basically played a 424 today and then acted surprised when we couldn't possess for shit. 

Other than that, Targett isn't ready, Yoshida hasn't played well yet, and Cedric needs two actually defensive midfielders in front of him for us to get the best out of him. I do sort of wonder what the point of signing such an attacking right back was though if we're going to play four forwards though. His overlaps weren't good today but it's tough to overlap when it's that crowded in the offensive third. 

Still optimistic though, especially after seeing how much less bad we looked with Romeu on the field. Clasie and Bertrand can't come back soon enough though.

I know exceptional teachers who have trained for post 16 pathways and then have transitioned into Secondary. They do not have QTS but are still fantastic educators.

My main gripe with QTS is that it is far too simple to achieve. If you come in to a modern secondary school as a Newly Qualified Teacher, you simply need to have decent enough lesson observations to pass to be honest. I know a number of people who have passed their NQT mentees as they couldn't be bothered with the paperwork. I am aware that some schools will require more, however this is a dying trend.

I do feel that there is a place in Education for individuals to come in with skills that have been gained in the real world.

What is more worrying is schools over-recruting NQT teachers who are grossly underprepared for the realities of teaching and are simply thrown into the classroom like fodder.

Well it is a rather large challenge when they just said ""We will have the Conservatives"". 

Facts are Labour doesn't have a clue what it is doing, it is just a clusterfuck without a solid winning candidate in the bunch, trying to win with the left probably just isn't achievable, the country on the whole is too content, and therefore all they care about is keeping a bit more of their money, the conservatives have yet to cut enough for everyone to be dying and therefore people no longer putting up with there shit, and even now they have slowed the rate of cuts so people don't notice everything going to shit so quickly.

What needs to be looked at is why girls are doing better than boys academically, and how to balance the performance, not by inhibiting or favouring one group but by making the worse group better better. 

There are several known factors that cause it, one quite ironically being mixed sex class rooms, it is found that while Girls aren't distracted by Boys in the class room and do similarly well to single sex class rooms, Boys are distracted by Girls and therefore do worse. Rather entertaining if I do say so myself. 

The reason for low uptake of girls in maths and engineering has nothing to do with academic achievement in itself, it is to do with girls choosing not to do the subjects and not being presented with the options or put towards the options to do them at both GCSE and A Level, let alone degree level. Then as you go through these academic levels you get more and more disparity in the genders which generally makes the situation worse for whoever the serious minority is, can't go out drinking with girls/guys if there are no girls/guys on your course to go out drinking with you, that is assuming you even like the very few people of the same gender on your course anyway, there is no guarantee of that.",null,1,null,1439650957,null,null,false,0,cu3x756,null,t3_3h34vp,null,null,null,t1_cu3v3xj,null,null,null,1441266583,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

First of all, as pointed out elsewhere, the methodology isn't great. It asks people their opinion based on a one minute clip from Andrew Marr.

Here are the amount of people who responded that they'd would be neither more nor less likely to vote Labour if said person was leader of the Labour Party based on the clip shown (in parantheses, those undecided):

Corbyn 45% (50.2%)

Kendall 52.7% (55.3%)

Burnham 53.8% (57.7%)

Cooper 55.8% (61.1%)

As we would expect, most people don't make their mind up in 60 seconds.

But let's keep on pretending these statistics are somehow painting an important picture.

Let's consider the opposite, how many people say they would be less likely to vote Labour (again, parentheses is among undecideds):

Corbyn 19.5% (12.7%)

Kendall 22.3% (18%)

Burnham 18.5% (11.5%)

Cooper 20.9% (11.4%)

In particular, let's look at people that voted Conservative in the last election, some of  whom Labour has to convince to vote for them, how many say more/less likely to vote Labour given a certain candidate:

Corbyn 19%/32%

Kendall 14.6%/23.5%

Burnham 16.8%/23.6%

Cooper 12.8%/23.7%

As we can see, what little these numbers tell us is that Corbyn is the most divisive of all the candidates, so he attracts the most people but also pushes away the most.",null,0,null,1439650998,null,null,false,0,cu3x7sm,null,t3_3h3a95,null,null,null,t3_3h3a95,null,null,null,1441266591,null,17,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

A lot of fluidity with the other attacking players. He's been drawing defenders and slotting chips to other players such as Dolph - anyone who can make a run in behind.

Obviously great reaction to starting to get so heavily marked - play him in the gap between opposition defense and mid- draws all the opposition players around him like wasps to jam, leaving acres for teammates to run into. It seems so simple, but so right. And Kane's lobbed pass to Chadli wasn't so good, but to Mason was amazing!

So in that case, what we need is not a classic striker or a centre-forward, but pacy players with the balls to make runs. Like Chadli. Or I hear there's one in Ligue 1, young kid named after a US President or something?

That is quite bad and silencing. I have to admit, I did chuckle a little when Banana's where thrown at them.

All I think the counter protests have done now is make the previously incredibly frustrated White Marchers go from angry to incredibly frustrated and angry, whereas if they had just been left to their march I bet a few of the fringe activists would have just felt embarrassed and left the group if there was a peaceful counter protest and no drama. Now it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of them feel isolated and they lash out randomly. Not sure I agree with how all of this went down. Extremist groups, no matter if they're White, Muslim, Hindu, Black Supremacists or just Militantly Communist deserve their right to protest and the longer they decide to do so the longer people see how stupid these fringe groups are.

The environmental factors include, both peer pressure, people like to do things with there friends, people friends are often of the same gender and therefore girls end up following into subjects with them. There is also societal issues where in the past general more academic roles were a male pursuit, then there are stereotypes that teachers will push on people meaning they will assume girls are worse at maths and this will actually make girls perform worse at maths, peoples perceptions of you can quite literally change your performance at something. 

Most schools don't present the options for peoples future very well so they are making ill-informed decisions, following their peers, their parents ideals, their teachers ideals, and often these are all pushing girls away from hard science and mathematical subjects. 

As soon as you stop forcing people to take maths more girls than guys do, and that disparity is just increased all through AS, A2, degree and at the postgraduate level.

This is one of the reason for the disparity based on income at top universities, while people with greater income of course can easily mould a better application, people on lower incomes don't have the support or pathway guidance to even think about applying.

null,null,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;The member states have already said what they wanted and what they didn't want (they created the mandate for the negotiations after all), and it's up to negotiators to read the political mood and to negotiate with that in mind.

You're talking as if ""the member states"" is the same as ""politicians"" and ""the people living there"". They really aren't and if you ignore that you're ignoring a huge part of application of game theory to politics.

The people who have been involved in these negotiations have no specific mandate to agree this deal. No one, as far as I'm aware, has been specifically elected with TTIP in mind.

Therefore politicians are exercising their broader, unspecific mandate to represent the will of the people. However, politicians are human and have their own thoughts, feelings, and motivations, so the idea that they will always represent the will or best interests of ""the people"" is not guaranteed.

Your explanation of this game is basically has two outcomes: A) It passes (+1 to everyone) or B) It fails (-1 to everyone)

When actually you have several options in my opinion:

* It passes and everyone is happy as it boosts economies, etc (+2 to citizens, +2 to politicians)
* It passes and politicians are happy but citizens are not (-2 to citizens, +2 to politicians)
* It passes but public pressure resulted in change that the citizenry desired (+2 to citizens, +1 to politicians)
* It does not pass and thus nothing changes (0 to citizens, -1 to politicians)
* It does not pass, but citizens are happy as the deal contained clauses they hated (+2 to citizens, -2 to politicians)
* It does not pass and an opportunity is missed as an 'opportunity cost' (-2 to citizens, -2 to politicians)

If you do what you have been doing and just look at ""pass"" and ""don't pass"" and assume everyone's interests are aligned, the outcome for pass is an average of 2.33 whereas the ""don't pass"" is an average of -1.66. You're right, they should be negotiating in secret to ensure it passes.

On the other hand, if you are purely looking at the citizens, who after all the politicians are supposed to really be representing, the only favourable outcomes is that the deal happens to be entirely perfect, public pressure changes the deal, and it doesn't pass.

Only one of those three outcomes can actually occur if it's all done in secret, and the odds of that succeeding are pretty low based on the information we have heard. 

So you're using game theory to oversimplify a situation, which is one of the dangers of using game theory. You're also missing the fact that two level game theory is how to get treaties passed *in the face of domestic opposition*.

If you think this is fine because you agree that the public are overreacting then fine, your justification is valid. However, to people who don't think governments should be agreeing to deals that they staunchly oppose, your justification is irrelevant, as it's telling them something they already know: The reason it's in secret is because they know there is wide spread opposition to it, and yet they want to pass it regardless.

Why do we still not have a midfield? I don't understand. Fair enough Bentaleb starting poorly is unexpected but the fact remains it was a glaring need we have done nothing about.

We've started brightly in both games so far only to be utterly mediocre from the 20th minute or so onwards.

- Kane was injured, that's why he came off. Don't blame Poch for that.

- Do we really expect not to let a team get a single shot on target? Yeah, we were too lax today in the final third, but the way people are talking is like they expect a 0 shot, 0 shot on target game week-in and week-out. We aren't Chelsea. That isn't going to happen. 

- Part of this is due to the system. Watch the way the CBs and FBs drift in and out of the center of the pitch. The get dragged wide when the wingers/CMs aren't covering the open space on the edges. Lamela was particularly poor at covering his space when he came on. I counted three times that Toby or Walker motioned for him to get wider. Dier was also pretty bad about leaving wide open spaces up front. 

- Even after Kane came off we had some decent play going forward. Dembele controlled the ball very well in the midfield. Mason was on fire while he was on. Chadli created space pretty well and had a physical presence.

&gt; I'm not surprised at the bemused response from the slipway owner. There do seem to be a lot of people in the boatyard business who prefer everything done on a shake and a nod, and if you want paperwork it's perceived to be your problem.

I've noticed this and find it very annoying. :P I've spoken to a solicitor (I think this falls under Consumer Protection?) and she has agreed to look over the insurance policy wording and the contract on Monday. That said: I currently only have the insurance policy. The slipway owner has yet to come back to me about handing over or emailing the contract.

In the meantime, he is adamant the lifting shall be done this Monday and that handing over the contract on Sunday evening leaves us with sufficient time to read, amend and agree to it. I've explained to him that he's had 2 months to get the paperwork to us and we're not prepared to rush this now that he's in a hurry.

&gt; As to looking over the paperwork, you might find it easier to find experienced boat owners to have a look, rather than a lawyer familiar with the area. There are several forums around, catering to different styles of boating.

The problem with this is, that most people we've met so far who either claim to be experienced or are said to be experienced by other people, often turn out to know not all that much at all. :-/ The only people I trust in that regard, are the owners of the marina where we're moored, and they've given us some pointers already. I don't want to annoy them too much, but I will if I have to.

I will give the forums a try, though!

Competitiveness is not valued at all, it's all about luke-warm communication skills. The system does not value risk taking or entrepreneurship, in many cases it goes as far to punish it.
Boys are penalized for masculine behaviour, yet girls are rewarded for feminine behaviour. Naughty has become synonymous with boisterous. 


On top of that there is much more support for girls, there are gender quotas for universities and schools aswell as companies. All to favour girls yet none to benefit boys. There is all sorts of pushes and programs to make women 50% of politicians and 50% of business board members and 50% of STEM workers, yet none to even the playing fields or help men at the very bottom of society (bin men, street cleaners, sewage workers, prisoners etc) all of which are areas that men dominate.

Men are also discriminated against in courts. They get longer prison sentences for the same crime, where they are sent to prisons with a much lower standard of living and there is much less support for them when they do get out. Men get hard done by in divorce courts, they have their finances destroyed in order to favour women, they have absolutely no chance of seeing their children a decent amount aswell. 

Let's also not forget men are much more likely to suffer from mental health issues, yet for some reason there is more support in place for women who have mental health issues.

null,null,Doomchicken7,num8,,null,"Absolutely abysmal second half display. 

Lamela put in the worst performance I've seen from a Spurs player in years. Four fouls, one chance wasted, one poor corner, and countless giveaways of possession. He's back to where he was two seasons ago, and I can't feel optimistic about him anymore. 

Bentaleb was anonymous once he came on, I don't think I heard his name once and I only noticed him twice - once dispossessed on the dribble and once struggling to control a poor pass form Lamela. It's clear he's not 100% physically or mentally and he needs to ride the bench for a while.

Chadli was, as usual, anonymous except for his goal. If we weren't so desperate for goals, he'd be dropped - but he scores, and that's what we need. Pochettino moving him to striker has exacerbated this problem.

Eriksen had a great first half, testing Butland several times and showing nice skills on the dribble. He must've been injured to come off at half time, and I really hope it's not a bad one. EDIT: Wait, he stayed on? Not having Kane and Lamela to link up with neutralised his effectiveness.

Dembele was Dembele. Dribbling, but a lack of passing. To his credit, he attempted through balls. However, they all failed. His shot was good, and he needs to show that kind of accuracy more often if he wants to keep playing.

Kane was very good. His balls over the top, first to Mason, then to Davies, were absolutely gorgeous and it's clear he's our most creative player, as well as our most clinical. He adapted well to being marked heavily. I can't believe Butland saved that shot early in the second half. I'm praying his calf injury isn't anything serious, because we're so reliant on him it isn't even funny.

Mason was the man of the match in my opinion. He was absolutely everywhere, passing the ball around and helping us keep possession flowing. Our midfield went to shit after he was taken off - a bewildering decision by Pochettino. His defensive efforts were great, blocking two dangerous shots, but he was also dangerous at the other end. He forced a world class save from Butland and showed great skill to produce a chance - that he missed. 

Dier wasn't noticable, but what was noticeable was how much more solid our midfield looked with him as Mason's partner. Him and Bentaleb doesn't work too well, from what I've seen, but him and Mason has got to be our midfield going forwards. His goal was a good header, and I want to see that more often.

Davies was acceptable. Defensively he was fine but he picked up a clumsy yellow and had another poor foul after that. Going forwards he had three moments - the worst cross from deep in history, the assist for Chadli, and a so-so cross at the end. I feel like Rose would've done a better job in his place.

Walker was good once again. The yellow card - I'll get to that in a minute. Defensively he was fairly good, but going forwards he looked dangerous, despite not quite creating anything. I'm happy for him to keep starting. For the second goal, he wouldn't make the challenge on Ireland, but I think that was down to him being on a dodgy yellow card.

Alderweireld must be fuming that Joselu got away with his dive. Other than that, he was solid. Vertonghen too. However, quite often a player would run between them and they'd both expect the other to pick him up. That should improve as they get more familiar with each other. 

Lloris was a beast between the sticks, pulling off several great saves. However, I feel Butland was the better of the two goalkeepers today. Lloris' mistake was inexcusable and we're lucky Mason was there to save the day.

The referee was awful. Affelay brought down Dembele with a tackle from behind and got away without a card, then Walker was carded for something more minor five minutes later. Pieters dove twice without getting a card. He was then fooled by Joselu's dive (he kept it just inside the area and flopped, clear dive), and gave a penalty. He then let Pieters shove Walker and Affelay slap Walker twice without producing a card. You could say he could've sent Lamela off, but I wish he had. 

Townsend is by far our best right winger at the moment, and I hope he starts our next game - or N'Jie, if he plays on that side. We need a wide player to stretch defences, and we need pace to get in behind. Lamela and Dembele are the same - lots of dribbling, little end product. Dembele loses the ball less and gives away way less fouls, but Lamela occasionally puts in a good pass. Neither are good enough for us at the moment.

Dier and Mason is clearly the way forwards in midfield. Dier was solid and gave Mason a lot of freedom. I see on this subreddit a lot of people angry at Mason for poor defending, a lot of people saying Bentaleb needs to be paired with a defensive midfielder. Mason, however, is not the defensive midfielder in the pairing, Bentaleb is. Mason creates a lot more on the attack, and our possession game is far better and far more purposeful with him on the pitch. Dier defends and gives Mason the freedom to do that.

I think going into attack we have some stuff to iron out. In the first half, It looked like Kouyate, Zarate, and Sakho were all not exactly sure where they should be when going forward. It seemed like Kouyate and Sahko were always occupying the same space, while Zarate was drifting about not getting onto the ball. Same with the wide play; it looks like Jenko isn't sure if he should be going central or looking for the overlap. The two goals we conceded were frustrating because they were preventable. Watching the first one, every person in the stadium knew it was going to be cut back, but no one tracked the run, and the centerhalves just kept backing off. I do not want to touch on Oxford really, as he is 16, and his performances will vary as he matures between how he was at Arsenal and how he was today.

The second half was a bit better, but what I saw, Lanzini will need to bulk up significantly. He was muscled off the ball and seemed a bit behind the pace of the game. I would have like to see Jarvis come on, as I think his pace could have really rocked Leicester's back line, but fair enough to trust in a new face. Maiga has nothing to offer. 

All in all, I think Bilic will need to tweak the midfield in the attacking zone a bit. Defensively, I think we will sort the problems out as Ogbonna, Obiang, and the rest of the team mesh throughout the season. I think Noble is still brilliant and has a lot to offer the team. He ran the whole game and always was looking for a forward pass, Obiang looked decent after coming on, and Payet was brilliant. I hope he can keep it up throughout the season.

Chadli - before moving up front I thought he was our best player, got the goal, should have done better with another chance.

Kyle Walker had a rubbish first half, and got a bit better, but could easily see him replaced for next game.  
  
Alderweireld: opposite to walker, looked really solid first half then faded as we did.  
  
Lamela: oh wow was he bad, didn't run back, lost the ball every time he got it and fouled when he didn't have it. Sorry guys I don't see this being the season he becomes amazing.  
  
Also as soon as Kane, who was largely ineffective, went off, we collapsed. Everyone looked tired, and what with no spare striker we seemed to lose all shape, not great.

You're implicitly misrepresenting the *other* argument.

What you said is irrelevant as no one, probably besides our non existent BNP, is anti immigration. They are anti *uncontrolled* immigration. That means all we want to do is to be able to vet candidates and value them on the grounds of merit. There wouldn't be any shortage of plumbers and electricians as, under the assumption that they're in demand, they would be offered work permits etcetera. It would, in short, follow meritocratic procedure. We would then only be gaining the benefits of immigration and thus can be looked at as a positive.

It would have been better if /u/distineo used the term ""uncontrolled"" instead of ""mass"" immigration as the latter fails to highlight an element of quality.

Why did we not sign Ogbonna?

Why did we not sign Wijnaldum? 

Why in fucks name did we not sign a fucking first team centre-half?

With Forster out why not sign a big name goalkeeper?

We have sold our best players for £130 million and the replacements haven't been near the same quality.

Without Morgan we can no longer rely on a solid defence to win us games and our attack is solely dependent on Mane and Pelle. 

I am struggling to see how our issues in attack have not been dealt with. It is clear Mane will play off Pelle in a 4411, so why haven't we signed some creative wingers? Evidently Tadic isn't good enough, Jay Rod is coming off an injury and Long is not a winger.

To keep up the incredible run the club has been on we needed to take risks and invest in quality. We didn't and it will be a long season. ",null,1,null,1439656934,null,null,false,0,cu401p3,null,t3_3h3wht,null,null,null,t3_3h3wht,null,null,null,1441267948,null,6,null,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,6,null

My serious response would be that the UK generally has pretty nice equipment, but we always have super low numbers of them. 

Admittedly I'm no military expert, but look at the Type 45 destroyer. It has unbelievable air defence capabilities. The radar can track hundreds of objects the size of cricket balls, travelling at mach 3. But how many ships do we have.... 6. 

6 ships. Surely that's not enough to provide ACTUAL air defence if we needed it? 6 ships couldn't even defend the whole UK mainland. And we need at least one around the Falklands at all times. It's indicative that the original order was for 12 ships, but got reduced down to 8, and then 6 to save money. That can only tell me that we don't have enough, since we justified needing 12 in the first place.

So while these submarines ARE incredible, is 7 really enough to launch a serious attack if we needed to? Is it enough to carry out the patrols we need to do?

Higher up, he can do more damage by beating a man on the dribble, and use that cannon of a shot more often. Pochettino has seen this, and moved him onto the wing. I'm not a huge fan of him there, but I prefer it to him as a CDM.

Mason is our best deep midfielder at the moment. He's a key part to our possession game. His passing is positive, and that helps us make sure our possession has a purpose - and that lack of purpose was AVB's downfall. He presses well, disrupting the opposition's passing and helping us to win the ball back.

He's also a goal threat. His run today that Kane picked out was nothing short of brilliant. He also had another run Eriksen should've picked out. He can also work some space for himself with skill on the ball. Given the freedom to go forwards, he can provide the goals from midfield that we have lacked for years. 

Pairing him with Dier gives him the freedom to get out of position while pressing, because Dier will be sitting deep and covering for him. It gives him the freedom to push forwards and contribute to the attack, because Dier will be sitting deep and covering for him.

**Positives:**

- In-form Shelvey, is the best kind of Shelvey

- Montero is an absolute threat. Looks the fullback in the eye and says ""I'm going to fuck you over and over again in every direction and there is nothing you can do."" Full backs looks helpless against him

- Bambi on ice Gomis is gone, Lyon Gomis has arrived.

- Defence was impregnable. Might as well have built a a brick wall in the goal.

- Ayew is so far everything he was supposed to be and I'm loving it. 

- Cork quietly decided that Newcastle were going to play without a midfield today.

- I can't believe I'm saying this. Our fullbacks looked strong. Taylor has improved and Naughton is as consistent as they come. 

**Negatives:**

- Siggy has yet to find form. If we are going to finish above the pack again we need him in form, hopefully this is a temporary thing. If not we may need to shift Shelvey up and slot Cork in the back.

- ""Competition at each position"". Dyer and Routledge are leaps and bounds behind Ayew and Montero now. Going into the season I thought there might be some competition, but the drop off is significant. I hope they can regain a bit of form so they can continue pushing those in front of them.

- The teams around us look pretty good. Spurs is always trouble for us, Stoke is living up to preseason hype, Leicester is making noise and Everton looks as intimidating as ever. We'll take it one game at a time, but this season is going to be wildly competitive in the middle of the table.

- No Tabanou. Not really a negative, but I want to see our new signing play as he was apparently the best in his position in Ligue 1.",null,0,null,1439657178,null,null,1439661157,0,cu40625,null,t3_3h3scz,null,null,null,t3_3h3scz,null,null,null,1441268005,null,13,null,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,13,null

It's funny how people can watch the same game but have wildly different opinions.

For your first point, I dont think Poch expected two of our (relatively proven) subs to disrupt our game that much. We were 2-0 up. I was actually relieved to see Kane come off. He had a great game, but we didn't need more goals and don't want to risk an injury there. I think it's on the players for self destructing to such an incredible extent.

I think walker is excellent at times, but sometimes makes the wrong defensive decision. I was actually expecting to see Trippier come on, because Kyle was on a yellow and Trippier is a capable backup and his crosses look good.

I think Dembele was close to MOTM status. He was making tackles and taking the ball forward. Our most active midfielder in dribbling, tackling, and passing probably as well.

He doesn't seem to have the eye for the deadly through ball or cross though and a lot of his passes don't directly threaten. That doesn't mean the passes are useless though.

null,null,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; Ok so what should we be doing about the different choices people are making about a small group of subjects? 

Firstly actually actually presenting them with what the scientific concession currently says, rather than speculative rubbish, most people, such as yourself, can't even correctly assess the cause of the problem, let alone fix that cause, especially so if they don't know the cause. 

Just presenting people with the cause of the problem will inherently change intelligent peoples processes in dealing with the issue. This original changes will be due to them realising they are doing it, which they didn't before and therefore changing their behaviour accordingly, be that pushing girls equality to boys, or trying to include them more, or increasing their confidence within the subject by making girls question their own preconceived perceptions that girls aren't good at these subjects. 

Just knowing this bias exists and the causes isn't some made up ""in built"" rubbish can change mindsets. 

Then comes the fact this isn't going to change over night, while you can reach teachers with literature on the subject fairly easily, parents are going to be less engaged in the current scientific consensus on education, and ill-informed parents who are creating these ideals will be prevalent until they die off essentially.

This isn't a 2 year project, some subject have a 10:1 ratio within them, and to get past that and get it to relatively even numbers, or numbers respective of performance at least you are looking at a time scale more in the 10-20 year range. Even with active incentives to balance the subjects out, which personally I don't agree with, fix the inherent causes of the problems don't just stick a plaster over it 5 years down the line and say you are succeeding. 

&gt;Were you equally incensed when at the beginning of the thread someone blamed media and cultural stigma

Pretty much in every psychological study of the subject? It is pretty obvious from that statement you know nothing about this subject at all. 

&gt; Would it be so reactionary of me to believe that young women are making decisions based on their own self-confident autonomy and not merely passively reacting to what magazines were telling women before their mothers were born? 

You gain confidence from people giving you confidence, quite literally, if someone say you are good at something, then you do that thing, you will do better, than if they say you are bad at it and then do it. It has all been studied and reported within the psychological literature. It literally comes down to the fact that people think girls won't success in maths, so they do less well, that doesn't mean they don't succeed, but they do worst that their potential. 

passively reacting to what magazines were telling women before their mothers were born?

Ha, the magazines are still saying it, or at least they aren't supporting the ideas of girls being successful in the subject, you just have to look at what is upvoted and downvoted in this thread to see the fact that people don't even believe the truth of the matter that men and women are for all intents and purposes equally good at these subjects and it is pure environmental factors which means they don't purse them. 

&gt;  Or what a quickly withdrawn barbie doll from before they were born said?

What are you even talking about? What do you think they are still selling to girls, there is no such thing as Action Mans dream house, Action Man comes with a Tank, or a Helicopter or whatever, something that normally relates to some kind of manly job, Barbie, while can come with job related paraphernalia, in default form is just a pretty girl in some clothes, Action man was always a Soldier by default.  

The fact you are claiming this is a thing of the past really just shows your naivety and quite frankly your refusal to even change what science has shown is completely incorrect perspective on a subject.

 - Call centres, on the whole, have massive staff turnover. They take on kids fresh out of school with no concept of responsibility or repercussions and many don't last 6 months. The fact that they can seriously screw over the customer probably doesn't even occur to them, or if it does they don't care. Those that last 6-12 months can easily be promoted to team leader - which means before long the entire department is being run by people who are patently unqualified to do so.
 - Target-driven is all well and good, but the targets need to be appropriate. I can come up with a couple of real-world examples where a target process was set up that actively encouraged the staff to dick customers around. Not intentional, of course, but by the time it became apparent it would have meant explaining the gigantic screwup to a lot of senior managers and nobody wants to do that.

null,null,pmyteh,null,null,null,"Yes, the franchises are bid on. As Patch86UK mentions, many of them are effectively ""least subsidy"" rather than ""highest surplus"" decisions.

The single biggest source of government subsidy for the railway system is by direct grant to Network Rail for track maintenance and upgrades, though, so extracting out whether a given franchise actually makes an overall profit is a difficult accounting exercise. The franchising system also has an awkward tendency to cause buyers' remorse: franchisees over-bid for the contract, fail to generate the growth required and effectively go bust, giving the government the option of renegotiating the contract with a gun to their heads or putting Directly Operated Railways in charge under a management contract (which is what ended up happening on East Coast).

The benefit of the arrangement would be not just to possibly swap a public company in for a private one (which was our last manifesto commitment) but to reduce cost and complexity by eliminating some of the contractual interfaces between the huge number of moving parts that now make up the UK rail operations business. It's a similar argument to undoing the artificial purchaser/provider split in the NHS, except that essentially everyone involved thinks that the UK rail franchising system is crazy (even David Willetts: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-203959/We-botched-rail-sell-says-Tory.html), while there are still some people who defend the coalition's CCG reorganisations. Roger Ford is the go-to writer on this stuff, though Christian Wolmar's less polemical stuff is ... OK.

You could argue that it end up more expensive (though it's unlikely, as overall levels of subsidy for the railways are now three times what they were in real terms before privatisation and the returns on minimal capital for the private TOCs are proportionally pretty large) but the risk is strictly on the revenue side - a hypothetical Team Corbyn wouldn't need to find billions up front to get started (unlike with the utilities).",null,0,null,1439658033,null,null,false,0,cu40l9f,null,t3_3gyzuj,null,null,null,t1_cu3scxp,null,null,null,1441268204,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

The moment the financial crisis happened debt was going to skyrocket irrespective of policy, the most you can say is that it might not have doubled under a different policy than austerity, it might have grown a bit slower, but *every economy* that was impacted by the financial crisis has had their debt levels skyrocket. 

For example, US total federal debt

http://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart

Pre financial crisis, around 60%, post financial crisis around 100%.

UK equivalent

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-debt-to-gdp

45% to just under 90%

The point being that we did ""austerity"" in the UK much more than the US did, that's why Mr Krugman is forever banging on at us. Yet in terms of debt added there isn't that much in it, both around 40%.

And as I've said, austerity is winding down, the worst is over, there'll be less in the next 5 years than there were in the previous and in 5 years time it'll be done. You keep banging on about austerity being the end of the world but it patently isn't, it's a policy to cut public spending until the amount of money raised by taxation matches the amount of money spent.

The floating voters that did go Tory in the end did so because nobody in the Labour party rebutted the ""oh, Labour can't manage the economy, look at the global crash, that was their fault"" stand that the Tories based themselves on. Instead Miliband was busy chasing tax dodgers and carving a shopping list on a gravestone.

Voters have been unimpressed with Burnham, Cooper and Kendall because they have yet to demonstrate any difference between themselves and the pre-election opposition. Corbyn may well be a disaster but without a viable, visible alternative he's going to do very well for the next few weeks.

Basically everyone, from both the left and the right, who isn't in the pay of the big banks, big pharma, big oil and Monsanto etc. very strongly opposes these deals, because they are very bad news for over 99% of ordinary people.

People who openly and strongly oppose these deals include Joseph Stiglitz, Robert Reich, Noam Chomsky, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pat Buchanan and Paul Craig Roberts.

Robert Reich is very strongly against TPP (the same reasons also apply to TTIP in Europe) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8osDtyKt0

Geraint Davies (UK MP) “The harsh reality is that this deal is being stitched up behind closed doors by negotiators, with the influence of big corporations and the dark arts of corporate lawyers. They are stitching up rules that would be outside contract law and common law, and outside the shining light of democracy, to give powers to multinationals to sue Governments over laws that were designed to protect their citizens.”

Caroline Lucas (UK MP) pointed out in support of this that “the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, who are in trade agreements that include this kind of investor-state relationship, have been sued 127 times and have lost an amount of money that could have employed 300,000 nurses for a year“.

UKIP oppose TTIP because it is NOT a free trade deal. It's a Corporate power grab dressed up as a trade deal.

Bernie Sanders has written a very strongly worded statement condemning these deals, which I would recommend everybody read http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file

Elizabeth Warren fires back at Obama: Here’s what they’re really fighting about http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/elizabeth-warren-fires-back-at-obama-heres-what-theyre-really-fighting-about/

The purpose of Fast Track is a) to remove the Constitutional requirement for a two thirds majority (which is otherwise required for a treaty or international agreement) and b) to prevent any amendments to the deals being allowed or proposed. It becomes a simple up or down vote.

The reason for the draconian efforts to keep the texts of the deals a secret up until now is to enable Fast Track to be passed without a riot on the streets. It won't really matter after Fast Track is approved. It will be very hard stopping them getting approved whatever (in the US).

These Corporate Power Grab deals transfer Sovereignty to Corporations. They will only benefit the top 0.1% - the major owners and boards of large Corporations. They are dressed up as ""free trade"" deals in order to get them to pass. They will lose well paid jobs, increase unemployment, depress wages, increase poverty, increase pollution and jack up the price of prescription drugs. They basically screw both your health and your wealth.

null,null,zedest,null,null,null,"&gt;You keep banging on about austerity being the end of the world but it patently isn't, it's a policy to cut public spending until the amount of money raised by taxation matches the amount of money spent.

Ok firstly it is for some people, some people are genuinely having their lives ruined through austerity. Do you think its fair while we cut public services, that of which the poorer and more vulnerable of society rely on, to pay off this deficit, and then give the top 10% of our country tax breaks? How can you say this isn't a political ideology rebalancing the scales in favour of the rich?

And the debt only went up because we bailed out the banks.... How did an almost exclusively private sector problem become one that the most vulnerable in society are paying for, while the same year the banks got bailed out, the people who caused the crisis got record breaking bonuses?

Instead of austerity, what is wrong with investing in things like infrastructure and housing etc? 

Would appreciate an answer to the questions, I genuinely want to try and understand the other side of this, because as of now, I just don't.

Interesting question of whether Cameron is more 'real' (dunno - I think that's as good a description as any) than Burnham.

Personally, I think Burnham is more 'real' than Cameron - but my main problem with the man is that I keep feeling so sorry for him. I used to feel sorry for Ed Miliband, too. I do not want to feel sorry for my leaders.

I'm a strong Corbyn supporter, but I could live with Cooper or Kendall. If any of them get attacked, I'm unlikely to feel sorry for them. I'm pretty sure they'll give as good as they get.

I found that plusnet were very good at dealing with their own internal problems. If they ever over billed you they would immediately give you the benefit of the doubt and refund you.

The amount of times they didn't quite check the right box in the system is unbelievable. 

One of two things have happened here. Either everything has been ordered from BT wholesale correctly and wholesale are just being slow. Or Plusnet haven't quite ordered the correct product and Wholesale are taking ages to figure out what exactly to deliver to you.

null,null,Afflo,null,null,null,"Yup... I'm aware of that one.  I tried to find a good conversion ratio for US MPG to UK MPG...  The size of the gallons are different, and the official fuel consumption test cycles are different.

[The EC tests:](http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/realmpg/why-are-the-ec-figures-so-optimistic-true-mpg/)
&gt;The urban test cycle is carried out in a laboratory at an ambient temperature of twenty degrees celsius to thirty degrees celsius on a rolling road from a cold start, i.e. the engine has not run for several hours. The cycle consists of a series of accelerations, steady speeds, decelerations and idling. **Maximum speed is 31 mph (50 km/h), average speed 12 mph** (19 km/h) and the distance covered is 2.5 miles (4 km).

&gt;Imperial extra-urban fuel consumption (mpg)
The extra-urban cycle is conducted immediately following the urban cycle and consists roughly half steady speed driving and the remainder accelerations, decelerations and some idling. **Maximum speed is 75 mph (120 km/h), average speed is 39 mph (63 km/h)** and the distance covered is 4.3 miles (7 km).

In the US test, the speeds are higher (city/urban is a max of 56 mph and average of 21.2, highway+high speed/extra-urban maxes at 80 and averages 48.4 mph).  They also adjust the test for using A/C in 95ºF/35ºC and heat at 20ºF/-7ºC to better match real world usage.

I found that the actual conversion ratio for UK to US published MPG figures  is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5.  For example, the Prius, with identical drivetrain, is officially a 50 MPG car in the U.S. and a 72 MPG car in the U.K.",null,0,null,1439661196,null,null,false,0,cu426p2,null,t3_3h3jrt,null,null,null,t1_cu403xt,null,null,null,1441268956,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

2. We are enduring the worst fall in living standards since the 70s (1870's), while the wealth of the top 1% has doubled. The living standards are extremely poor considering we are apparently the 4th richest country in the world. Should we have anybody sleeping on the streets? Should we have 36 thousand properties in London registered in tax havens? Should 1million people be driven to using food banks? (fucking food banks, those things we used to collect cans for at schools and send to poorer countries) Should rich oligarchs be able to buy up property and leave it empty, while 1 in 4 children are brought up in an over crowded home? Should the same big 4 accountancy firms be allowed to help draft our tax legislation, then go back to their big multi billionaire clients and tell them how to exploit the loopholes? Should the poorest people in this country have to pay for the bankers crimes? Because what happened in 2009 was essentially the government bore the risk, and the banks gained the profit, and when the whole thing inevitably fell apart, we bailed the banks out, the same banks who saw record breaking bonuses that year. Does that sound right to you? The people who cause the crash and committed fraud got record breaking bonuses, while 6 years later the poorest people are getting bled dry through austerity, life destroying in some cases. Oh and should MP's be allowed to lobby for big business and abuse there position in order to advance their future career? Because that's essentially what is happening now. You may think we are doing pretty well, but I am 100% sure their is a much better standard of life out there for everybody, and its more than achievable.

null,null,strolls,null,null,null,"It's about smaller government, less public services and reducing the tax burden on rich people. 

In their first term, with the Lib-Dems, the tories cut the top tax rate. They have now reduced inheritance tax for millionaires. 

They do this under the claim that ""cutting taxes stimulates the economy"" - that may be true at times, but it is not compatible with ""we're out of money and we need to tighten our belts"".

This country has had a national debt for two or three hundred years - practically every government (or at least most of them, I CBA to check) have run a deficit over that time. 

It is economically illiterate to say ""we need to balance the chequebook"" because national economies are not like household current accounts - for one thing national debt does not ever have to be paid off.

That may sound shocking, but it's true - the nation isn't going anywhere, it is always going to be able to service those debts, and the important thing is that the nation grows its GDP in order to be able to earn more money in GDP than it spends on interest repayments.

This is not to mention the fact that much of the national debt is held by our own citizens, whose pension companies have bought secure government bonds; thus paying interest on the national debt puts money back into the economy.

Gordon Brown pursued neoliberal economic policies - if tories were honest, they wouldn't be putting him down and saying ""labour ruined the economy"", instead they should be crowing: ""capitalism is so great, labour copied us"". At the time - before anyone saw the global economic crash coming - the tories manifesto promised to follow the same economic policy as he did. The 2008 crash was a global phenomenon, and hardly Brown's fault. (He could have deregulated less, but then deregulation started under Thatcher and Major.)

The conservatives like to boast that, since the 2008 crash, we've had one of the best recoveries in the western world. Perhaps *the* best. But GDP doesn't tell the whole story - this has come at the cost of lower living standards for the poorer half of the population. In effect, we're experiencing a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.

I happen to agree with /u/dageshi about the public's appetite for socialism, but a smart person should be able to see through the austerity bullshit - austerity has been widely condemned by economists, who also universally favour [progressive taxation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax)

I believe that facts and evidence are of primary importance in politics, and it's a shame our leaders don't agree. They regularly ignore the evidence when they're following their ideology.

I think there was a blip around the 2008 crash, but we've now had about 40 years of rising wealth inequality, whilst social mobility has fallen at the same time. Those are metrics which are measurable and provable.

I don't think Corbyn's going to get elected (and sorry to be so grim) but I don't think it matters if labour wins another election under someone else - if they do so it'll be under a red-tory leader, so we'll just see more tory-lite policies, and they won't be able to reverse the trend. I think there's a strong likelihood that this trend will continue for decades more.

I don't particularly like how we bailed out the banks but I understand why it was done, because the alternative was worse (see American Great Depression). At the time there was so little time that it was probably the only option.

As for tax rates, Gordon Brown increased tax rates at the top after the financial crisis, the Conservatives reversed it, I expect because they wanted to remain competetive with other countries. They also I should point out raised the tax free allowance for the poorest in society, so to say that they only altered taxes to help the richest isn't true, those on low incomes certainly also benefited from coalition (as was) tax policy.

In terms of debt going up because of the banks... that's more complicated than it seems. Most of the debt generated over the past 5 years hasn't gone to the banks, it's just the regular expenditure governments have to make during big recessions. If we hadn't bailed out the banks then probably that number would be even bigger because the recession would've been even worse. So really most of that debt is down to the recession, did the banks cause the recession, well at least in part, but they weren't the only ones, government policy at the time and a lot of other factors certainly contributed as well.

And then we have spending extra money on public infrastructure e.t.c., nice idea but in this country it'd take 2-3 years before any kind of new infrastructure project got off the ground, so actually spending money on stuff that will make a difference right now is pretty hard. Housing has the same problem with planning restrictions and building on the Green Belt, hell there's no lack of demand for building new houses, it's where to build em that's the problem.

Here's the deal, in this particular recession I think austerity was unavoidable because the public had been scared so badly by the financial crisis that they were going to elect anyone who promised to get a grip on the situation. Politicians can't guarantee growth, they can guarantee public spending cuts because they control the budgets.

If Labour had run surpluses for a few years pre 2008 then when the financial crisis hit instead of starting from -3% and the eventual deficit being -11% they could have started at 0% and it would've been 8%. Had they been running a 2% surplus then it would've been 6%, the point is once it was predicted to breach 10% the public lost confidence in Labour.

Even if they'd run a surplus not necessarily in that year but a few years before then I think public confidence would've remained with Labour, as it was Labour lost all economic credibility and that's why they've been out of power since.

Fundamentally what I'm saying is Labour doesn't really know what policies to have during a recession like this, they know how to spend money during boom times, which they did during New Labour but their official policy solution for the recession was basically the same as the Conservatives, it was the same as all the big parties.

Labour should have prepared for a recession, they shouldn't have assumed they could keep spending ""during the good times"" indefinitely, as one Labour MP said ""if we couldn't run a surplus after 7 years of continuous economic growth when could we?"". More to the point, Keynesianism, the policy that Labour is supposed to follow says just that, you run a surplus during the good years so you can run a deficit during the bad years. If they'd done that then I think history would be very different, I think if they actually promised that now it'd massively increase their economic credibility with the public because the public understands ""saving in the good times to spend in the bad"".

So that's my view I guess, you think people voted for austerity because they somehow hate the poor, I think they voted for austerity because nobody offered them any kind of credible alternative and for what it's worth I don't think Mr Corybn's economic policies, that is to say socialism are ""credible"", I don't think the British public will either.",null,0,null,1439662165,null,null,false,0,cu42o7b,null,t3_3h3a95,null,null,null,t1_cu419qv,null,null,null,1441269185,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Oh come on. By that metric Leeds and Forest should have people queueing up to buy them. 

&gt;The board. It's actually quite simple; to progress you need to invest - something this board hasn't done and have no plan of doing.

The reason we are actually in a position to accept investment is because of the tight board. We could have so easily ended up like so many other teams by misjudging spending, but instead we are OK; yes, just OK... But there are plenty worse things we could be. 

The clubs that have had investment have had more going for them regionally or infrastructure wise, or have got lucky that a smart, super rich man (Stoke for example) is a die-hard fan.

1) You can't read too much into the authorities' unanimity because the group is self-selected around a particular viewpoint (see also City economists and members of British university sociology departments).

2) You can't read too much into the authorities' success because we don't know the counterfactuals - if Smith had been elected in 1997, the ""winning team"" would have been somewhat different and may have made different recommendations. Because of the shortage of elections, there really isn't an alternative set of predictions to test the first group against.

The old advice to ignore private parking tickets is not valid any more (at least for 95% of companies issuing them). Companies will take you to court if you continue to ignore letters.

If the company is a member of the British Parking Association then after the companies own appeal procedure, which will fail as they don't care about the circumstances; they just want your money, your option is to appeal to POPLA which is an independent parking appeals service.

There is no reason not to appeal to POPLA as it costs you nothing and costs the companies £27. The result is binding on the company and not on you, should you lose.

If the company is part of the Independent Parking Committee instead (IPC), they have their own ""independent"" appeals service.

Those quotes are there for a reason, it's neither independent or fair to motorists.


My suggestion: post here - http://forums.pepipoo.com/index.php?s=27d43082f73b5baefd32d32e3b573ae5&amp;showforum=60

Post up whatever you have received, minus personal details.

These guys deal with private tickets all day long and have tried and tested methods of appealing to POPLA etc.

On the other hand, if you decide you can't be bothered with the hassle of writing some letters and just want to pay up to make it all go away then still don't pay the invoice.

Many politicians have principles but they're usually confined to the backbenches as we saw with Corbyn until this surge. The politicians we typically hear from and see have risen up to the point where they're prominent and usually are in either a cabinet or shadow cabinet position. 

The nature of having a prominent position is that you've had to compromise to get there. A minister may have to defend a policy they wouldn't have agreed with had they been a backbencher but the nature of collective reasonability in the cabinet means they'll defend it. They have to speak with one voice. Likewise a party leader will have had to reconcile different fractions within their party and hence will have compromised somewhere along the line. 

What you mean is that Corbyn is uncompromising. He isn't toning down his language to appease the more right/moderate Labour members. He spent his career rebelling against the leadership in the commons. 

Kendall is generally seen pretty negatively but she is clearly going to finish last and still goes to hustlings, a lot of which are packed with Corbyn supporters, and keeps giving her view of where the party should go even though she knows it's unpopular. She even gets booed sometimes. I would say that is principled as well. 

The other possibility, quite common with Reddit to be fair, is that principle actually means 'says what I wanted to hear'.

&gt;In terms of debt going up because of the banks... that's more complicated than it seems. Most of the debt generated over the past 5 years hasn't gone to the banks, it's just the regular expenditure governments have to make during big recessions. If we hadn't bailed out the banks then probably that number would be even bigger because the recession would've been even worse. So really most of that debt is down to the recession, did the banks cause the recession, well at least in part, but they weren't the only ones, government policy at the time and a lot of other factors certainly contributed as well.

Do you not think regulations need to be put in place to stop this happening again? Is this the failure of capitalism that Marx predicted? Seems the only thing he got wrong was the transformation, but I think that was mostly due to no1 being in place to take over. I'm pretty confident that if the conservatives were in power during the crash, and A Jeremy Corbyn led Labour was ready to pick up the pieces, that the transformation to a socialist society wouldn't of happened? I mean obviously I'm not in a position to make a credible prediction, but it could of been interesting to say the least.

&gt;And then we have spending extra money on public infrastructure e.t.c., nice idea but in this country it'd take 2-3 years before any kind of new infrastructure project got off the ground, so actually spending money on stuff that will make a difference right now is pretty hard. Housing has the same problem with planning restrictions and building on the Green Belt, hell there's no lack of demand for building new houses, it's where to build em that's the problem.

Well surely investing in infrastructure in hope of long term stability would be better than the path we took? A bit off topics, but in the middle of a housing problem shouldn't we make it a priority to stop foreign oligarchs buying up housing in London and leaving it empty? Along with implementing a rent cap, so that private landlords can't charge extortionate rates, that is pretty much socially cleansing people in certain parts of London.

&gt;Here's the deal, in this particular recession I think austerity was unavoidable because the public had been scared so badly by the financial crisis that they were going to elect anyone who promised to get a grip on the situation. Politicians can't guarantee growth, they can guarantee public spending cuts because they control the budgets.

How have we got to a point where something like Austerity that has never worked is the ONLY option? I don't think He got a grip on the situation at all. Austerity causes the economy to shrink, unemployment, suffering, and an overall lesser standard of living, there is no point rushing to pay off the deficit if you completely fuck your economy and the people who make it tick.

&gt;so to say that they only altered taxes to help the richest isn't true, those on low incomes certainly also benefited from coalition (as was) tax policy.

At the moment disabled people are losing their benefits, and the top 10% are getting a tax break through inheritance tax, how can you justify this?

I agree with what you said about Labour, although it's worth noting that at the time the tories actually backed all of Labours spending plans, and actually wanted to spend more.

null,null,Omnipollus,null,null,null,"Right, it appears that Newham has three classes of licence - mandatory HMO, selective and additional. Four tenants would require an additional licence, but two tenants would require a selective licence. Selective licences are cheaper, so the landlord is trying to save money by pretending less people live there.

The ramifications for you are that the 2 who sign the contract will be on the hook for the rent, bills and council tax. The other 2 could leave and it would be difficult if not impossible to force them to pay their share. It's a bad idea for the 2 who sign the contract.

The landlord is putting themselves at risk of prosecution if they have the wrong class of licence. As tenants, you are at no risk, and the landlord isn't allowed to sanction you because of their own malfeasance. But it could lead to financial problems for you if the landlord denies all knowledge of the arrangement and falsely claims you are illicitly subletting - they could try to evict the 2 not on the tenancy agreement to save their own skins.

My advice would be to avoid this landlord - if they're willing to lie to the council to save money, imagine what they'll be willing to do to their own tenants.

Type 45s are designed to provide lone air defence for small fleets and carriers, not to operate individually or in large groups. They are not designed to defend the UK's air-space from foreign aggressors, a task that is best left to the Quick Reaction Force.

If we're in a situation where the entire of the UK runs the risk of being attacked by enemy aircraft, then the enemy has enough force to overwhelm us. That's it. It'd be a simultaneous land, sea, and air invasion with no hope of repulsion without launching nuclear weapons at the enemy state.

Defence is the opposite of a good idea, if you try to defend everything **something** will get through. ""The bomber will always gets through,"" ""the best offence is a good defence,"" ""he who defends everything, defends nothing."" It's all the same. For an efficient military you need a highly offensive, fast moving, strike force backed up with the intelligence apparatus to know exactly where and when to strike, then you need to assault the enemy before they've even prepared. Rapid reaction capabilities are paramount.

Huge forces can be left to wither on the vines with a simple series of interdiction missions and be left to wither on their vine, almost all air defence systems can be left useless with enough saturation fire. All more forces do is make you easier to target and eliminate, they lull people into a false of sense of security.

The trick remains to stop the enemy before they're dangerous. If it ever reaches the point where there is an existential threat to the UK, then it's already too late to do anything about it no matter how many hulls you put in the water, planes you put in the sky, and troops you have marching down the street. The UK would lose. So, there is absolutely no point of preparing for it.

I disagree here, as a parent of young children and as a teacher. The reason so much impact is made at this age is because of parental influence. Throwing money at Nurseries isn't the best idea. Aside from anything else, the sort of parents who you would want to target can't afford childcare, and their issues are more complex than can be dealt with in a few hours in a class of 20-30.

Often girls who had got pregnant early on, or who had been in an abusive household, or who had just plain gone off the rails.

The amount of these people who would drop out of the course because they were told that because it was over 16 hours a week they'd lose their benefits was incredible. I saw it first hand with a good friend of mine who suffers from mental health issues after childhood sexual abuse, has 2 kids from estranged fathers, dropped out of school after getting pregnant at 15. Smart girl, desperately wants to learn Chemistry. I spent weeks looking for a way to make it work, but her being unavailable for work, or losing her housing benefit, made it completely impossible for her to drag herself out of her situation. In the process making a massive difference to her two kids.

We need to spend money on adult education. On retraining, especially as technology moves faster and people are less likely to have a job for life. The economic impacts are immediate and they knock on to the children of those improving their situation.

I think we've been looking at this completely backwards. Have great, accessible childcare obviously. But if you really want to dramatically improve children's lives, do it by helping their parents get on. And don't let decisions made when someone is 13 or 14 decide the entire path of their life.",null,0,null,1439665112,null,null,false,0,cu446ob,null,t3_3h2g7p,null,null,null,t1_cu3thfn,null,null,null,1441269897,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

null,null,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt;  geneticist and calling people morons

My education doesn't make other people any more intelligent, it also doesn't mean that I give a damn what idiots on reddit think of me, this subreddit is literally plauge with morons, just look at this very thread, all the upvotes have gone to ideas that are absolute made up BS, because the majority of people on here are idiots, too stupid to actually understand the information even if it is presented well, oh and by the way, I have presented it fully cited in the past, people are literally too ignorant or stupid or something to understand it, and would rather just upvote the BS they already agree with. 

Just look at the demographic of this site, the majority are loser guys with nothing better to do with their lives than sit on reddit all day, who are they going to upvote, the person who saying loser guys should be better off and people doing engineering and maths are great, or the one who sitting here saying actually societies inherently favours guys to do well in that setting and that is the reason women aren't getting as far, yep that right it is the one which says the guys are great. 

Then actually the problem is exacerbated because the only person who argues with the current scientific consensus on the matter are idiots, anyone else just agrees with what the experts believe because they know more than them, they know more than you, more than me (I am not a social psychologist), more than everyone, then very very occasionally someone comes along with a synergistic theory or a differing view point that can't currently be shown to be correct or incorrect currently, but normally it is just a sack of morons. 

I am a geneticist and therefore I do know that any discussion about genetics in this matter is absolute bollocks, and anyone who even tries to bring it up is an idiot, because the scientific consensus of the genetics involved in this are to quote any genetics researcher ""I don't know, but probably not a lot."", with the probably being in there because they are scientists and scientists wouldn't rule something out without solid evidence first. 

&gt; you saying that you have a scientific background is essentially saying ""as a mother, I know all about children"".

Yeah, and so you should, I am a geneticist, I am not a social psychologist, however, there is a thing called google and if as I already have done, you use it, you can find the answer for yourself really god damn easily, I am not a teacher, I am not heard to pander to the whims of morons who can't be bothered to look it up yourself, if you don't believe me, I don't give a damn stay stupid, and if you ask inane questions after I have presented the current scientific consensus on a subject, I am going to call you a moron and tell you to google it, as is life. If you want to have an intelligent discussion that is another whole idea, but they are few and far between on reddit and pretty much non-existent on this subreddit, which seems to be particularly plagued with idiots, less so than the default ones though I suppose. 

&gt; In the politest possible way, what you said comes down to ""I know best, shut up"".

Another thing to be aware of is that psychology is a broad field. Areas such as cognitive psychology are very clearly scientific based.

&gt; What about your surveyor? Although it's usually their clients making the docking/lifting arrangements, they are often closely involved and will surely have some awareness of the issues involved.

We phoned a surveyor a long time ago and they said they couldn't do anything for us unless the boat was out of the water so the hull could be inspected. It's a bit of a catch 22 there: we can't buy the proper insurance (apart from 3rd party liability insurance) to protect us when the boat is going out of the water unless we have a survey done, but we can't have a survey done unless the boat is out of the water.

Old cheap bike with slipping gears =&gt; you probably need both a new cassette (the gear wheels at the back) and a new chain. That’ll cost ~ £45 + labour.

If you get much change from £100 in parts + labour I’d be surprised.

I’ve always been quite happy with the service at Warlands on the Botley Rd - they’re the antithesis of an elitist bike shop. But that might not make your bike any cheaper to fix.

Another alternative place to try would be the Broken Spoke bike coop: http://bsbcoop.org/ You could either fix your bike there, pay them to do it, or bite the bullet &amp; get a fixed up second hand bike for less than the cost of fixing your current one (if you transfer your new tyres to the new one, at least you wont lose their value on the transfer!).",null,0,null,1439665525,null,null,1439666657,0,cu44e83,null,t3_3h45oj,null,null,null,t3_3h45oj,null,null,null,1441269998,null,5,null,oxford,t5_2rc7b,5,null

The idea that he's lost his spot is nonsense really. I have little doubt he'll start more than 3/4 of our games if healthy. 

Markovic is a unique one because honestly I think he's better than Ibe and has a higher ceiling. He's a bit frantic when he gets in there, but I don't know if Ibe's caution is necessarily any better.

Frankly, I don't really rate Ibe to the degree everyone else here seems to. Or the rate Rodgers seems to. It feels everyone is just amped to have an heir to Raheem and I don't think Ibe is that player. 

He has the gifts and the mentality to be better than Sterling, but I just don't think he's there yet. And I think every moment he's on the ball we lose that little bit of quality that could be bettered by Coutinho, Firmino, or Lallana. 

Got a bit off topic, but I suppose my point is that right now I feel like Markovic could make the leap up faster than Ibe. Throw Ibe to the wolves at a lower league prem team if they'll have him.

Ok, so this is where I suspect we differ, albeit for what I think are equally principled reasons. I firmly disagree that Labour should base plans on £120 bn of taxes because it's unrealistic and hence dishonest. I think we should have the principle that it is a moral obligation to pay the tax you owe, but not put a number on how much extra we think people would pay unless we're absolutely certain we have a plan to get that money. Otherwise once in government people will feel let down very quickly.

As to a ""soft"" centrist apporach. It depends what the aim of the party is - if it's just as a tactic to get elected, then I agree it's pretty pointless.  However, if it's a way to run the country that meets Labour's basic aims of reducing poverty while maintaining popular support then that's entirely different.

Corbyn's surge over the past few months goes back to the welfare bill.  Here was Labour compromising simply for the sake of power. If instead Harman had said ""we can back a reduction in tax credits so long as it is accompanied by an equally big increase in the minimum wage"" then I think Labour supporters could have supported that position since it moves the burden off the state, but crucially ensures no one is worse off.

So I disagree that a centrist approach necessarily means compromising all the substance away. However, I agree with the welfare bill that's exactly what happened.

It's [this](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/iceland.jpg) fucking bullshit. It conveniently leaves out the fact that to do that, Iceland willingly fucked over millions of regular savers throughout Europe. They didn't stick it to the bankers, they stuck it to everyday people.

Here's a hint: anyone using the term ""bankster"" almost certainly doesn't have a clue what the hell they're talking about and is trying to use emotive language to drive the discussion"".

I  just finished a book called ""Austerity, the history of a dangerous idea - Mark Blyth"" where it explained the financial crisis in detail, and obviously Iceland was mentioned.

Well if the conclusion you came to is what the book says, then I suspect it might be biased somewhat. Not read it so I can be sure though, but it sure sounds it.

&gt;So the free market economy caused the financial crash, which led to us bailing out the banks, which led to overspending and debt. Isn't this the definition of a free market economy not working?

That's a colossal oversimplification. The ""free market economy"" didn't cause it as such. That's like saying democracy caused it because democracy was running things at the time. The causes of the crash are very complex and multi-faceted, and I suspect this book is missing most of it out to try and make a political point. 

Plus, the UK has had a national debt since the 1600's. The notion that the crash gave us a debt is simply bollocks.

&gt;Isn't this the definition of a free market economy not working?

Not at all no. I think this book is very much misleading you about what a free market economy is. For one, we don't have one as such. No one does. We have a mixed economy that is both free-market, and state-regulated.

Labour's role right now is as the opposition, which means their purpose is to challenge the governing party and keep them in check.

The other labour candidates don't seem to be interested in that, they want to make the labour party electable in 2020. This is totally understandable, but at the same time they won't be fulfilling their role as the opposition in doing so.

Under Corbyn, the labour party will be an actual opposition. They will be a force to be reckoned with for the next five years, and will challenge the conservatives at every turn, forcing them to think seriously about every decision they make. This is a win for everybody!

In the coalition, the conservatives had the lib-dems keeping them in check, and now they have nobody and have gone completely fucking insane as a result.

I want Corbyn to lead the opposition just to get some of that back, I want the conservatives to have a bit of a leash again.

What that will mean for labour at the next election is anybody's guess, but the conservatives need somebody keeping them in check right now, and that person is Corbyn.

&gt;If Mr Corbyn is not to be regarded from the day of his election as an enemy of Britain’s Jewish community, he has a number of questions which he must answer in full and immediately. The JC asked him earlier this week to respond. No response has been forthcoming.

&gt;1. Did you donate, as alleged by its founder, to Deir Yassin Remembered (DYR), a group that publishes open antisemitism, run by Holocaust denier Paul Eisen — an organisation so extreme that even the Palestine Solidarity Campaign refuses to associate with it?

&gt;2. Have you, as Mr Eisen claims, regularly attended DYR’s annual conference?

&gt;3. Why have you accepted an invitation to appear at a conference on August 22 alongside Carlos Latuff, the notorious anti-Semitic cartoonist?

&gt;4. Why did you write to the Church of England authorities to defend Rev Stephen Sizer, a vicar banned from social media because of his habit of posting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, telling them that Rev Sizer was “under attack” because he had “dared to speak out over Zionism”?

&gt;5. Why do you associate with Hamas and Hezbollah and refer to them as your “friends”?

&gt;6. Why have you failed to condemn the anti-Semitic posters and banners that dominate the annual Al-Quds Day rally, sponsored by the Stop The War Coalition, which you chair?

&gt;7. Why did you describe Raead Salah, a man convicted of the blood libel, as an ‘honoured citizen’?

About the crash, to my understanding If a major bank is running thirty times leverage, as was common in the run-up to the crisis, all it takes is a very small change in its asset values against its equity cushion to make it illiquid, if not close to insolvent. When secularized mortgages started to lose value in 2006, that very small decline became all too real, and the big banks that had funded themselves through the repo market (essentially borrowing overnight to loan for much longer periods with huge amounts of leverage on their balance sheets) saw their funding sources disappear. Liquidity, the very thing repo markets are supposed to provide, dried up, since no one was willing to lend to anyone else at normal rates. And because the banks were so levered up, they didn’t need all their funding to dry up just enough to make them almost instantly illiquid.

The book is probably good, but as I have only just started reading about this, my personal understanding isn't at a level to talk to someone who does understand this stuff.

You asked for a hard-right platform not a justification for the Conservative platform. I am stating that a hard-right platform would be to eventually completely remove the NHS and move to a more American style system,

* Income tax is but one tax. The overall taxation is not reducing

Yes. A hard-right platform would want to reduce tax. 

* Just leaving the EU might be a step to far for them

Of course it would. Not for a hard-right party though.

* If you abolish minimum wage, you need more social services. Right wing want a bare minimum wage.

Traditional Conservatives hate the minimum wage. They believe the free market should dictate it and that it kills jobs. If someone wants to work for less they should be allowed too and it could help more businesses (is their theory). The Tories don't though because they're not hard-right.

* Yeah, they removed it.

Yes they removed that implementation of it but you missed off the rest of my post where a specified that they replaced it. The newer one is more permanent but won't be applied on already taxed profits from other nations.

There are no guarantees that consecutive mid-table finishes would make life easier to fight for the top four. On the contrary, there are legitimate arguments that it won't:

* Lower table and no Europa means that we lose prestige in the eyes of players. Whoever takes our spot will be the 6th ""big English club"" instead of us. We would likely lose out on players who are on the edge in terms of talent (e.g. Eriksen, Lloris, Vertonghen) and we would fail to capture rising stars (sorry Alli) or established talents (Toby would be back at Soton).

* No Europa means that we have fewer competitions to test ourselves, develop our talent in real top flight competitions, and spread the brand.

* Worse table finishes means that we would not be able to command the same sorts of sponsorship/advertising fees. What would management use as leverage when negotiating shirt sponsors or naming rights? We were in the fight for top 6, before we willingly gave it up - we swear?

Conclusion: there's no reason we should settle for 8th-10th even if we are not realistically in the fight for top four. The team should continue to do its best for the top finishes and honors it can feasibly achieve. No less.

I guess I misjudged replying at all, because the last thing I wanted was for my words to be used as fuel against the candidate I support.

The Jewish race have been through hell over pretty much their whole history, the Holocaust being only one of the most recent and cruelest chapters.  The city my university's in has a tower in which scores of Jews were killed in the Middle Ages, so every time I get a bus into town there's a tall and imposing reminder of how senselessly persecuted Jews have been throughout history.

There really were, and are, true anti-semites out there, people who wished and wish genuine harm on people just for being Jews, and as a result it's a very strong and serious accusation to put into play.  And I think it does the victims of anti-semitism (physical _and_ mental) injustice when that accusation is used lightly.

I'm not saying Jeremy isn't an anti-Semite, though I obviously don't think he is.  Nobody has put forward any proof that he is, just coincidences and speculation.  Jeremy is being expected to prove he isn't, and I'll be really honest and say that I don't like this ‘guilty until proven innocent’ tone coming out of this debate.  When we have people saying that he [‘must prove he isn't an enemy of the Jewish people’](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-must-prove-he-is-not-an-enemy-of-jewish-people-10453596.html), I can't but help feel it bitterly ironic.

I don't _know_ why Jeremy's not directly responded to these accusations.  It looks bad for him, yes, but I have a feeling that he sees them as personal attacks, and he's made his view on personal attacks crystal clear.  I don't know if he'll change his mind.  Personally I sort-of hope he will, so he can put the issue to bed.

As for the points I've ‘glossed over’, my honest answer is that I don't know enough to give meaningful answers.  Note though that:

* He's actually [_pulled out_](http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/142259/jeremy-corbyn-pulls-out-conference-which-antisemitic-cartoonist-due-appear) of the August 22 conference.  Yes, that's a JC article.  Note the response from his spokesperson.
* Anyone can claim they have the backing of Jeremy Corbyn—the fracas about Diane Abbott using his name to endorse her campaign for London Mayor shows this.  So the fact that Paul Eisen said Jeremy donates to his group means sod all unless we have proof that Jeremy did.  We don't (AFAIK), and [Jeremy's camp have _denied_ it](http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/mail-corbyn-holocaust-smear-busted.html).

The fact that _I_ can't personally give a response to all the other allegations, what does it tell us about Jeremy?  _Nothing_.  Or at least it should mean nothing, because it gives no evidence _either way_.  Not that he is an anti-Semite, not that he isn't.  If we're demanding evidence from Jeremy, which as I've said I think is an inversion of justice, then that's up to him and his staff to provide.",null,0,null,1439669292,null,null,false,0,cu468xr,null,t3_3h36c2,null,null,null,t1_cu44jqc,null,null,null,1441270870,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

null,null,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"It takes about ten years after training, so new partners now were graduating from university in around 2003. I don't have the statistics to hand but back then, it was around 50/50, and I think it would be ludicrous to suggest that it was 80/20. Trainee intakes back then *certainly* were not 80% men.

It is also worth pointing out that about half of new trainees in law firms did not do a law degree at university because it is possible to convert. Thus, the fact that women have been entering university more generally on a par with men makes it strange that they have not entered the upper echelons.

Make no mistake, this is absolutely down to promotion practices, but also has other factors involved. Making partner involves huge personal/family sacrifice that, anecdotally, fewer women are wiling to make. It also requires a somewhat political competition, although that aspect of it has reduced.

The same argument that you are suggesting has been running around concerning judges. There, the promotion criteria favour men even more obviously. [Looking at this article,](http://www.legalcheek.com/2015/07/judicial-girl-power-a-long-way-off-but-women-make-gains-on-bench/) you would think that the problem has been solved, with almost half of young judges being women. However, when you look at the actual judges who are promoted to the senior bench, very very few women get a look in. Baroness Hale, the only woman on the Supreme Court, [actively bemoans this,](http://www.legalcheek.com/2015/02/baroness-hale-bemoans-11-years-women-judges-overlooked-promotion-highest-court/) and is an extremely important voice for the advancement of women in the legal profession.

There is of course no one suggesting that women have a duty to push for the highest positions, but I can tell you that it is very obvious within the profession that many women leave mid way through their careers, whether to scale back to a less high end firm or to take up a less demanding position. This is not because they are less talented or deserving. Many of those leaving are the most talented women, who if they were men would be assumed to become partners.

It's improving a little bit, and many firms are making a genuine effort. What is extremely obvious from within is that it has nothing to do with women's abilities relative to men (obviously), and nor does it necessarily have to do with women not wanting to become partners. They just seem much less likely to eventually pursue that ambition to its conclusion. Like I said, there's a lot of soul searching going on and no one is sure exactly what can be done because it is obviously a whole array of factors.",null,0,null,1439669531,null,null,false,0,cu46d48,null,t3_3h34vp,null,null,null,t1_cu45y3r,null,null,null,1441270925,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I'm sure if you've seen enough submarine based movies you'll be familiar with the ping noises they make.  Most famously in the hunt for red October where Captain Ramius sends out a sonar ping to let the Americans know he's planning to defect.

Probably the best chemical exfoliant for sebaceous filaments is salicylic acid. You should start with something between 2%-5% strength, used once every two days. Bravura and SR-Skincare are good websites to find these products. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and moisturise after using them, as they can dry out your skin otherwise. 

I also found that oil cleansing also makes my SFs less noticeable, which is where you use some kind of oil, like mineral oil (baby oil), coconut oil etc, to clean the natural oils off your skin. Check the /r/skincareaddiction sidebar to find out which oil would be best for your skin and comprehensive instructions. The basic principle is that you apply the oil to clean dry skin, leave to sink in for 5-10 minutes, massage in, then rinse off with lukewarm water and/or use a gentle foaming cleanser to clean off all the oil. I personally use pure tea tree essential oil diluted in baby oil as my cleanser.

Ok, this is interesting, how are my numbers wrong?

This year: Turnout 66%. 36.9% voted Conservative, thus 24.35% of the electorate voted for them.

2005: Turnout 61.3%, 35.2% voted Labour, thus 21.57% of the electorate.

2001: Turnout 59.4%, 40.7% voted Labour, thus 24.17% of the electorate.

A greater percentage of people eligible to vote, voted for this government than either of the two most recent non Conservative governments. 

Fair, for you it is not a Conservative/Labour issue, but for a lot of people it is, and the figures above would probably be quite a shock to them.

null,null,wdtpw,null,null,null,"&gt; Raising taxes actually does significant damage to growth.

This is too simplistic. In the first instance, taking money off people means they can't spend it, so the economy slows down. However, this doesn't account for the government spending that money instead.

There is a multiplier effect on jobs from government spending. The question is whether the extra you get from spending is more or less than what you lose from taxation. The reason government spending might increase jobs more than taking money in taxation reduces it is mostly because taxation tends to take most money from the wealthier sectors of society who tend not to spend locally, while government spending can (not always, but can if applied carefully) be used to redistribute money to those who will spend it more in the local economy - i.e. the poor.

If more money circulates as a result of this policy, you end up with more jobs, not less.

It's essentially different forces. Is the economy bound by how much the business owners have to invest, or is it bound by how much the consumer has to spend? Generally, it would be consumer spending that is stimulated by government spending.",null,0,null,1439672007,null,null,false,0,cu47ksr,null,t3_3h3a95,null,null,null,t1_cu44ptr,null,null,null,1441271562,null,10,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

I know he's still young but I really don't think he's a good fit for this team. Probably not for any premiership team as his playing style just doesn't mesh with what's required in this league. Maybe in Italy or France or Spain, where he has the space and support to create off the dribble (to steal a basketball term) he'll do better.

Veretout didn't do all too well but with a new team and such a difficult game around you going faster than you are used to...he did alright. No serious flaws besides being moderately overwhelmed so I don't understand the level of criticism he is getting. He will improve.

Ayew, in my opinion, improved a large amount from last match. He wasn't invisible and held the ball up much better than I expected. He showed some skill on the ball and many times when he lost it he just didn't have a passing option!


As for who impressed: 

Amavi - nothing new to say. He did well and I think his mistakes will lessen as he acclimates.

Richards - starting to think he's the big strong CB we've needed. He is good at moving the ball past players and finding a pass, getting up for the attack, commanding, already seems to work well with Clark

Gueye - agree with what others have said. Very impressive.

Bacuna - yes Bacuna. Thought he stepped up and defended pretty well against Memphis (What?!). Showed the first bit of defensive instinct I've seen from him as well.

Guzan - good to see him put in a solid performance

Sinclair - showed some flair and decent hold up play which was good because I've been unsure about him lately

It is also worth pointing out that in the not too distant past, Virgin did have pretty harsh ""caps"". Download too much and your speed gets halved/quartered for the evening. Upload too much and the same happens.

Openreach tends to be okay, especially when you have a competent ISP who is able to whip them into shape. It's BT Retail themselves that are crap - and of course, not all issues are even caused by Openreach, but are caused by the ISP you are signed up to.

null,null,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"The issue is where that extra money comes from.  Before the academy system started, schools were paid a certain amount of money, and for each school in an area, the local government was given a bit of money for educational purposes.  That extra money would then be spent on services available for all of the schools in the area.  Sometimes these were mundane services - buying school equipment in bulk making it cheaper and simpler - while other services were vital for a lot schools - SEN support etc.  One big thing in particular in my local area was a facility for children that were expelled from other schools - when it was clear that that wasn't working for them, they could go to this particular school that offered much more tailored teaching so they could still get an education.

That's the money that is removed from the local government and paid directly to schools when they become academies.  For a lot of schools, this is a good thing.  Many schools pay more into the local government than they actually get out.  For example, a school in a richer, more middle-class area is not going to have to deal with anywhere near as many exclusions and expulsions as a school in a rough area of town.  Likewise, grammar schools have far fewer severe SEN needs than many other schools because they've already pre-selected many of the students that can at the very least perform at a high capability.

Unfortunately, that leaves the schools that take out more than they put in.  Additionally, with fewer schools involved, costs get higher as they lose the economies of scale.  The local government has to cut their own services, so the last few schools remaining in the old system are now far, far worse off than they were before.  They still need the services, so they either set those services up themselves (often taking staff away from their normal jobs to deal with the new problems) or buy the services from independent - private - contractors.

Sure, this isn't quite ""privatised education"", but it does encourage more and more schools to be run more on a profit basis than on a long-term, financially-independent, child-centred basis.  The more schools need to worry about money, the more they will focus on tactics that ensure they get the most money, and the less they will focus on more expensive, but more effective options.  That is a bad thing, no matter what.

So yes, in many ways this does make many schools better off, but it does so at the expense of the education of others.  That seems to me to be an incredibly poor trade-off - state schools should be fundamentally focussed on ensuring that those with the most amount of need are getting the basic education they deserve, rather than giving those who already have most of the things they need a little bit more on top.",null,0,null,1439674311,null,null,false,0,cu48oke,null,t3_3h2g4v,null,null,null,t1_cu3v12d,null,null,null,1441272151,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I am not charging VAT to any of them - for the companies that are located inside the EU but not in the UK, I record their VAT ID and zero-rate the income as ""Services to other EU country"". For companies outside the EU I just zero-rate the income as ""Services outside EU"".

We aren't a small country though, why should we be on equal footing with Belgium or Holland ect. when we have an economy which is an order of magnitude larger? How does this help us?

null,null,Axius,null,null,null,"Honestly, all he has admitted there is, in the below paragraph and a sentence, that he isn't willing to stand up for what he believes is right and will tow the party line no matter what. 

&gt; Burnham sees the welfare vote as a “watershed” moment in the leadership contest. He opposed the bill but obeyed the whip and abstained. Jeremy Corbyn voted against. “Three of us were members of the shadow cabinet, and one of us wasn’t,” he explains. “I’m not someone who’s ever gone in for grandstanding and big gestures, or putting myself over the interests of the party. I didn’t over that and I wouldn’t going forward.”

&gt;Asked if he has ever broken the whip, he shoots back a straight one-word answer: “No.” Is that important? An emphatic yes

Personally, I feel it's traits like this which make him unsuitable to be leader. The Labour party does not need a candidate whose main concern is 'What does the party want?', because it isn't a far stretch of the imagination for this to become 'What does the electorate want?'. It would create a leadership that is more reactive than proactive and that is not a positive in my opinion.

That's not to say that Labour should be telling voters what they want, but I think there's an appetite for some sort of change off the back of the recession; to create something positive from it, and just reacting to what people's day to day problems are will never tap into that. I think Corbyn's approach is touching on that.

He's correct that politics is a team sport, but team sports rely on a lot more than just co-operation to win. Team sports have players in positions of strength where they are most effective, and team sports often have a manager who knows what the strengths of their team are. I think he has a place on the team, but I don't think he's good for the leadership right now. I think it's going to be between Cooper and Corbyn, but if he takes some of the criticism onboard, he has some potential to be a later leader.",null,0,null,1439675221,null,null,1439676229,0,cu4947t,null,t3_3h3fda,null,null,null,t3_3h3fda,null,null,null,1441272355,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

&gt; Liverpool's problem last season wasn't defence, it was scoring goals 

I'll agree with him on that in a *limited* sense. We couldn't create chances last season, and the goals dried up through injury and/or unsuitable players. As a whole, the team played slightly more defensive, and that left the back four unit less susceptible to being attacked -- which meant less goals conceded. That said, the less goals conceded part also corresponds with when Lucas was introduced back into the side. 

I think that, as a team, we *do* need the balance of a DM. I might be alone in that opinion, but it's what I truly believe. We saw in the 13/14 season just what a leaky defence can do, and I think it's clear that we're more defensively sound with Lucas (or an able DM) sitting in front of the back 4. Hell, even Allen does a good enough job as a protective force. I just don't want Rodgers to lose the DM position because he wants ""ball playing"" midfielders who always provide attacking assistance and that to cost us in the long run.

null,null,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; About the crash, to my understanding If a major bank is running thirty times leverage, as was common in the run-up to the crisis, all it takes is a very small change in its asset values against its equity cushion to make it illiquid, if not close to insolvent. When secularized mortgages started to lose value in 2006, that very small decline became all too real, and the big banks that had funded themselves through the repo market (essentially borrowing overnight to loan for much longer periods with huge amounts of leverage on their balance sheets) saw their funding sources disappear. Liquidity, the very thing repo markets are supposed to provide, dried up, since no one was willing to lend to anyone else at normal rates. And because the banks were so levered up, they didn’t need all their funding to dry up just enough to make them almost instantly illiquid.

Sort of, but at the same time, no.

The most damaging factor is that mortgage portfolios are bundled up and sold as investment derivatives. They are then unbundled, rebundled, and resold on. Do this as many times as you like. The problem this made was that when the crash hit we knew which *houses* went to shit, but we didn't know where those mortgages were as they had been moved around so much. Now normally it would be a bit of leg-work to locate them, but perfectly doable. Unfortunately it had transpired that the institutions that gave the credit-worthiness of those derivatives had been, well, exaggerating the strength and credit-worthiness of some of them. This meant that all the financial institutions had no idea whether their holdings were AAA rated or junk, and their rating was worthless at this point. This position of having no idea whatsoever about your financial position was what was colloquially referred to as the ""credit crunch"", with the average person experiencing it via a lack of an ability to borrow money, or their employers unable to expand due to a lack of ability to borrow money, all deriving from their not knowing if their own assets are worth what they say on the box, or are worthless.

Big wake up call this one, but at least Bilic helped turn things around after the break. Could have easily won this one despite our shite first half performance, but I'd say a draw would have been fair. I can handle losing, just not like that FFS.

Ref fucked us and our marking was utter shite, pathetic awareness to let the man run in like that, what a freebie. Both easy goals while Sakho hit the bar and had a shot from very close range straight at KS. Not to mention the clear penalty and other half decent opportunities in the second half.

As for Jenko, yeah he was awful but it's his first game back, he'll be quality again with time. I do feel for Tonks though, been such a great player for us for so long and gives it his all, not to mention he's been good in preseason getting in on the goals and did a very decent job out of position at the Emirates. 

I also really like what I see of Obiang, Lanzini could be a good player for us too with time.. Zarate needs to be less greedy and work hard, he's got the goods. We now desperately need a winger and a quality striker, while Song should be joining later on, which create more depth for us in the middle of the pitch. Let's move on now and focus on getting all three points v Bournemouth, can't underestimate them, they've got quite the philosophy!

The political system is supposed to be about principled individuals (parliamentarians absolutely love that quote from Edmund Burke *'Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.'*) but we have what is effectively a two party system which demands parties which must be very wide coalitions, containing all sorts of idealogical positions, and then demands that individuals compromise their judgment for [a common public position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility), in order to get into the cabinet, and any position of power.

I don't really agree. Not sure the ref should be making that level of judgement call anyway. Had he not been clotheslined, the only thing between him and the goal would have been the ball. And it was very cynical on the Leicester keeper's part; he was making ZERO attempt to play the ball. For me that's a red all day. 

&gt;I'd have sent him off for that boot to the chest every time.

Yeah, it's debatable. If he'd given the red in the first half, I could see it. But if you don't give a red for the inside-the-box, not-even-trying-to-play-the-ball clothesline, then how can you give one for the offensive-zone, last-ditch-attempt-to-play-the-ball dangerous kick?

Now, maybe we will never have a hostile relationship with the US but being independent has political advantages and having more control over the arms production system may increase our options later in the life of the systems to upgrade or re-purpose for UK specific needs.

That plus the jobs, plus the potential for defence relationships with countries using our systems (Saudi Arabia, China) although they could be more ethically chosen of course. And (as a pro-European) I think there are significant political and economics benefits to investing in a pan-European defence industry rather than leeching off the US contractors. Then being persuaded to invest huge amounts of money into ""partnerships"" like the F-35 project which has left us out of pocket and has been as big a black hole as any Europe-based spending cock-up. Admittedly that's not off the shelf tech like you said but by tying our defence to the American industry it makes the likelihood of being coerced into future projects like that greater. You only have to look at the efforts to get other countries to sign up to see the benefits of being unaffiliated - they needed buyers or project would lose billions but we invested too much to turn away - other countries had other options and having your own industry gives you that other option and also provides thousands of jobs as a sweetener

That's just one side though and it's ignoring the issues we've seen in the past with the carriers etc but it's not black and white. There are real benefits to not buying off the shelf from the US.

null,null,mooli,null,null,null,"You're probably better looking at the original source than that reasonably biased interpretation of it. 

For example, there were several responses among non -  and ex- labour voters where a majority prevented Labour as too weak on big business, or that it should tax the wealthy more. This idea that non voters are more right isn't Bourne out by the data. In fact, the range is far too broad to draw such a simplistic conclusion. 

Labour's loss in the last election is complex, and simply saying ""they were too left"" is missing all kinds of nuance.

Personally, I think Labour cannot win an overall majority again, especially with the upcoming boundary changes. Their biggest own-goal in government was believing they could pull off Blair's trick indefinitely, and selfishly not pursuing electoral reform. 

What people want is to have their views represented in government. The Tories don't represent the majority, but nor do Labour. The more they try to be broadly appealing, the less any one particular group finds them worth voting for. The only support they really have left is those whose hate of the Tories is so deep they will vote for a diminished labour no matter what. Is that really a basis for a political party? 

Corbyn's success is not down to a shift to the left - its down to actually standing for something and finding a significant group of people energised by that message. The centrist candidates have energised... nobody, labour's centrist attempts at the last election lost them Scotland, and the party running on a centrist platform (Lib Dems) were utterly wiped out. 

When people don't have a reason to vote for you, the solution is not to be more bland.

Also check what profession you put on there, some make the quote higher than others.
Also, gocompare (i believe) allow you to enter more details than normal comparison sites, i added where i park at night, do i drive a lot at peak times (which is no) my drivers licence number. All these things help get cheaper quotes.

That said, it is very expensive (especially for non-UK students!) and living in London for three years is also incredibly expensive. I would say that whilst going to somewhere like CSM is good, what matters more is how much extra time &amp; effort you put into your course and career development. UK university is very structurally relaxed, especially in the arts so you will definitely find that what you get out of the university is going to be directly proportional to the amount of legwork you put in, especially when it comes to things like internships and critiques. 

Ultimately I think the main reason to go to somewhere like CSM is because of those opportunities and connections that it offers, so it's super important to get to know your tutors and your peers and make an impact on them. Having a leg up from a connection you've made can make all the difference. 

With regards to volunteering and having internships, that'll definitely work in your favour! A lot of UK students won't have anything like that due to coming straight from school, and UK universities (especially arts colleges) generally look very favourably on any sort of industry experience.
