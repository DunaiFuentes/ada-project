No one starts on crack, they take weed or MDMA then after a while their dealer offers something harder.

If weed shares the shelves with tobacco this changes the situation markedly. I'd expect a few more tobacco smokers to dabble but weed smokers would no longer be buying of drug dealers. 

This puts many dealers out of business and shuts it off as a gateway drug.

Professor David nut already showed us that in and of itself it's less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco. 

What problems it does cause are made worse by the illegal status. Growers harvest ASAP to avoid the police. The problem with this is the CBD levels don't rise until right at the end of a growing cycle.

CBD is the medicinal part of the plant THC being the ingredients that gets you high. High THC low CBD strains are the most dangerous and though I've never smoked users tell me less pleasant. Think vodka from a backyard still vs vodka from a proper distillery.

null,false,Galerath,null,null,null,"&gt;  I've read so many articles saying Corbyn is unelectable, but not a single one saying why.

The short answer is that actual left wing politics now fall outside the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window).

The longer answer is that the last time Labour actually stood for *Labour* they [failed miserably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992) and lost to a Conservative Party that was in full melt down. As a result the common perception is that the British Public (read as ""Middle Class Middle England Swing Voters"") will vote for a lame duck conservative presiding over a completely broken cabinet rather than anything remotely left wing.

There is likely some truth to that matter, even with widespread support a party cannot take power without targeting the right demographics in the right areas. See for example UKIP who had fairly wide spread support, taking 12.7% of the overall vote, but only got [one seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015#Results). This is a symptom of the completely broken and undemocratic mess which exists at Westminster.

I think that whether or not Corbyn is a viable candidate is not clear cut. For one thing, Neil Kinnock (the last left wing Labour leader) stood for election over 20 years ago now, and that's 20 years of there being *no serious left wing representation in UK politics*. A lot of people like myself are on the Left, but not Left enough to go vote for the SWP or BCP or any of the other myriad Marxist groups. I frequently struggle with deciding who to vote for. But then, England, especially the south, tends to be very small c conservative and I think increasingly the ""I'm alright Jack"" attitude is taking hold.

The SNP have shown that being competent and having some core Left wing views can get you a great deal of momentum, but of course, Scotland is famously left wing compared to England.

Legalisation will take the production and distribution away from the current dealers and criminals involved in it. Currently because you have to go through illegal channels to access weed you will likely be exposed to other harder and more dangerous drugs. However, if weed was legalised it would mean you no longer have to deal with the ones also selling MD, ecstacy, coke etc.

Legalisation absolutely will have the opposite effect compared to what you say in your comment. It will distance weed from other drugs that you've known people to get involved with. I understand your concerns but they are misplaced as legalisation is exactly the way to prevent that from happening!

Â£ The Shore, Leith (previously a rough area, now trendy wine bars)

Best thing to do is to use Citylets (http://www.citylets.co.uk/) and browse the properties from the map view - Edinburgh's different areas are pretty compact and run into each other (e.g. Bruntsfield, Morningside, Tollcross, Marchmont, Newington) and so each benefits from the same kind of environment (Meadows, coffee shops, cinemas, restaurants, Victorian-era flats)

Edinburgh City Centre / South has 4 main streets to live near (they make an H-shape)

Lothian Road (all the way through Morningside from Princes Street)

Melville Drive (bisects the centre around its biggest park)

South Clerk Street (all the way from North Bridge to Cameron Toll)

Leith Walk (picks up from North Bridge and runs down to The Shore)

I think this is just fear. Offering people a significantly higher minimum wage (e.g. Â£10), improved working rights (more holiday, maternity and paternity protections), nationalised transportation services that are affordable for everyone, a good quality well funded NHS are all popular ideas. A huge number of UKIP supporters would even like them.
Combine this with the fact that Ed Milliband was considered ""too left wing"" and the conservatives have just adopted a bunch of labour reforms in their budget kind of undermining the whole ""policies are an issue"" thing.
Its never really been about policies. Its been about bullshit like ""labour wrecked the economy"", ""the SNP will destory us all"" or ""Milliband seems weak"".

The reality is that quite a lot of the leadership of the labour party are right wing and in the wrong party. They aren't in labour because they believe in improving the power of labour over capital (which should be *the* consideration given the name). They're just in the party because its part of the political framework that allows them to achieve personal power and influence.
People like this exist in every society on earth and it is a classic example of why single party states have descended into personal squabbles.

If labour wants to win an election it needs to decide what its principles are and break the narratives with a groundswell movement.

I used a new mud mask the night before my work xmas party a few years ago and the next day my face was all red and irritated. In face I'd avoid mud masks in general, as they work by bringing impurities to the surface, which = spots.

I would go for something gentle and hydrating, like a sheet mask. There are lots of Asian ones I could recommend at a good price, but they wouldn't arrive on time. 

I've used this one, [Hydraluron](http://www.boots.com/en/Indeed-Labs-Hydraluron%C2%99-moisture-boosting-mask_1434516/), and it's currently on offer in Boots. It's still a bit pricey (it's a box of 4) but it didn't irritate me and really plumped up and brightened my skin. However, please still patch test - just cut a corner of a packet, rub some of the essence onto your inner wrist or inconspicuous area below the jawline, then seal back up again with sellotape. Wait 24 hours and check for any reaction (try not to wash it off in the meantime!).

If you haven't used it before, you can also check ingredients of products on [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_a6d0198315.html), this will list potential irritants and acne triggers etc. It's not infallible but might help you choose a safe product.

I got a wok, put in a little bit of oil and started to fry some chicken breast I'd cut up into bitesize pieces. Then once the chicken is no longer pink I added some various coloured peppers or onion that I'd chopped up and you just keep everything moving about until the chicken is cooked all the way through. (Just cut a particularly big piece in half and make sure there's no pink inside).

It's not fancy but you're cooking fresh stuff.
http://i.imgur.com/NPQz6V4h.jpg

Once you can do that you can start experimenting with seasonings or spices (ASDA has loads that aren't too expensive) that I usually add at the same time as the vegetables to give everything some flavour. I started adding spring onions and chili peppers and other vegetables. You can also throw in a jar of sauce and turn it into a curry.
Or get some tortillas and have a burrito.
Learn to boil rice or noodles and then you've got something else to go with it. After that I tried making fried rice / noodles instead.

There's really a lot you can do with something so simple as starting with a chicken stir fry. I can do a lot more than that now, I'm confident to cook things for other people too. It took a fair bit of trial and error so start simple, and once you've got the hang of that, add more to it next time.


Even easier than all that above, and I still do this if I want something easy. Rub whatever seasoning you want into some cuts of chicken and whack it on a George Foreman Grill. Empty a bag of fresh salad into a bowl, place the chicken on too and add a salad dressing you like and you've got this.

The first is simply inexcusable; the second could be understood of a freshly-minted chancellor, but he's had years to work on it.

Jamaica, a country with no native anti-doping blood tests (ie, no out of competition testing, they only started testing finally this year) dominated sprinting for the better part of a decade, and everybody treats it like they're just genetically better or something.

Once you have that, decide what games you'd like to go to and find out when they go on sale to members. All games go on sale at 7am so you'll need to be up first thing. Make sure you're on 7am at the latest. You'll most likely be put in to an online queing system so be patient. 

For bigger games (Man United, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs and cup semi finals/finals) you'll need loyalty points. These are earned by going to matches, with more being earned for less popular games (early rounds in the cups get you 5 iirc).

Having a membership also gives you access to the ticket exchange. This is where season ticket holders 'sell' their seat for a game. So if tickets have sold out or you don't have enough loyalty points then you may be able to get a ticket on there. No guarantee though obviously.

I agree, as politics does sometime boil down to very tribalistic beliefs, but since Corbyn is more left than the candidates, and the further away you are from the centre, the more tribal it will get. (This goes for both sides of the centre). 

&gt; Over the last twenty-thirty years there has been an enormous convergence between Labour and the Conservatives; the combination of the Blairite adoption of neoliberal tenets like privatisation and a populist stance on immigration, combined with the conservatives softening on certain social issues (such as queer rights) have eroded much of the distinction between the parties, at least on the broadest levels

But society, whether people like it or not is better off for the blurring, we aren't driven by the thought that ""My way is right, and your way is wrong"", its a more consensus driven belief, since people very rarely solely left or right, they will take parts from around the political spectrum.

With Corbyn, people will look back at the consensus and go ""that wasn't so bad really"", since he'll just bring in a situation where he'll oppose the government, say some nice populist buzzwords against the Tories which the people will happily believe. 

Like for example, this: 
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scrap-tuition-fees-and-give-students-grants-again-says-labours-jeremy-corbyn-10392769.html

Nice fuzzy words and promises, but nothing of substance- how will he pay for it, will it just devalue the whole point of a degree etc. 

&gt; however, personally, I feel that Labour, if anything, needs to fall back on its cultural distinctiveness, to provide a counterbalance against the middle-england pandering, upper-middle-class run, London-centric Tories.

The whole point of Labour being ""the party for the working class"" is unsustainable, since the ""working class"" are hell of a lot different than when they first were set up. They are relics of an age with strong TUs and mines. The working class now are the single parents, poor families who work in low payed jobs. They are sceptical of immigration, so how can he say ""I'm for the working class, but like immigration"". He also has the student vote, possibly the more fickle voters of the lot. 

If Labour want to win, they can't fall back on their heartlands, they need to appeal to either- the old or the disenchanted. Which aren't solely people who hate the tories.

&gt; even though such reform might reduce their parties power in the future

Blair believed in voting reform when he came to power, it was then shelved since he was able to being a strong majority in parliament.

Heres my two cents on if Corbyn wins:

- The media will go along the lines of ""If you thought Ed Miliband was left wing, you haven't seen nothing left"", they make it out to be a socialist and to the unsuspecting readers of the sun, they will go ""ah we don't want a socialist, who will just through money around"".

- The Labour party will be split, rebellions which the Conservatives are notorious for, will go on the Labour side, since those blairite Labour MPs will see Corbyn as unelectable.

- The student vote will go over to him, this means that he would have to make good on his promise if he ever got into power, or face the hatred that the LDs had to face.

Labour are fucked for 2020 at the moment. This is exactly what the SNP and Tories will want- a disgruntled Labour party and will try as hard as they can to fester any splits.

My problem is that all of the arguments are based on historical election results, which I don't beleive are necessarily the best indicator of future elections.  The shift to the SNP was historically unprecedented and would have been completely unpredictable even 18 months ago.  (I actually reject the argument that it was actually a swing to the left, but had more to do with resurgent nationalism and a feeling that Westminster politics was out of touch with Scottish issues). 

The question is do labour need to go after people who have previously voted cons, to turn blue to red?  My instinct is that it's possible that Corbyn as leader will actually encourage a lot of new labour voters; non voters, people who'd voted green and other minority parties,  to vote labour.  I have no numbers on whether these voters would be in the right areas.  

It'd be nice to see some opinions on how people outside the labour base actually feel about Corbyn.  My feeling is that the attempt to paint him as a left wing loon will fall flat with most voters as he comes across as pragmatic and sensible in interviews.  I do however fear that he will be hit hard when the right inevitably try to paint him as a 'friend' of Hamas etc.

Now I've got being facetious out of my system I'll try and address your wants and needs like a good redditor :) - October isn't exactly peak time for celebrations and festivals (except of course my Birthday). 

The nights will be drawing in (it will be dark by 16:30 by the end of October), it will be wet and it will be cool. The only real celebration that happens nationally at that time of the year is November 5th (Bonfire night) and almost every town in England will have some sort of event to celebrate, usually a Fairground and fireworks.

I think you'd be much more likely to find something if you select perhaps 3-4 things you WANT/MUST see on your tour (big cities, museums, great Uncles), plan a rough route between these things and then what's happening along your route.

For instance say, London to Edinburgh - I'd perhaps go via Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, York,  Edinburgh.

If you know your ancestor's denomination and parish, it should be straightforward to find baptism records in the paper copies, if they're from one of the churches held there (most, but not all, are). See here for an overview: www.proni.gov.uk/guide_to_church_records.pdf

If your ancestor was a landowner, you should be able to check the land registry document, usually available at PRONI. These are generally arranged by parish, so it would be helpful to know where and when he owned land. 

Similarly, if you think your ancestor may have entered a workhouse, or appeared in court, then those records are available at PRONI, but again, not searchable online - you'd need to have an idea of the date and location. 

The more specific information you have, the easier it will be to find archival returns. Otherwise, you're reduced to reading everything from the date range in the hope of turning something up, which is a laborious and often fruitless task. There are some professional genealogists working here, although I imagine they'd be fairly expensive and there are no guarantees that they'll find anything interesting. If you do, however, have specific records that you need checked, I'd be happy to do that for you.",null,0,null,1437995936,null,0,false,0,cthmz0t,null,t3_3epvm1,null,t1_cthmz0t,null,t3_3epvm1,null,null,null,1440110971,null,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6,null

Worried about Mikel as our DM backup. I know a lot of people love him, but his ability is pretty bad. If Matic gets injured, we're absolutely fucked.  He's way too one dimensional; 1. Receive pass 2. Pass back to Terry or Azpi 3. Jog around our own box

We seriously need to sign some new defensive backups. Stones would be ideal for CB, but then we need a DM as I mentioned. One great option Imo is Krychowiak from La Liga, who I believe was in their team of the season, and he's only 26. Another option could be one of the Bender's. Both are great, but I'd prefer Lars for our system as he can get forward a bit better and he's taller. Finally, the best option Imo would be Gonalons from Lyon. He's good at getting forward, he's great at defending, and he'd have some mates from the same nation unlike Krychowiak or Lars Bender.

Basically, they can sell out with Foreverton - it's rare they do, but they can - and it'll be 9:00AM GMT. The selection you'll get at that time is okay, but not brilliant. Best bet is to go for an upper section but try to make sure you're not near the back, as your view will be awful.

Futhermore, you only get one priority ticket with a Foreverton membership, if your brother and mate want one, they're going to need to get a membership as well. There's no e-ticketing so your best bet is to collect from the box office on the day, not sure if they do international posting.

null,false,xereeto,cnty-scotland,"Unfortunately, Scotland is still subscribed to /r/UK",null,"[Here's some stats collected from Colorado's first year of legalization](http://motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/colorado-legal-marijuana-charts-statistics)

As you can see, it brought in $30M in tax revenue (and this is Britain, so it would get the shit taxed out of it here - not to mention the main reason it only pulled in 30M is because people were buying medical marijuana instead, which is taxed lower. We don't have legal medical marijuana here, so people would have no choice but to buy the taxed-up-the-wazoo stuff.)

Despite weed legalization, 41% of people still bought weed on the black market because, hey, it's cheaper. But that's still ~~69%~~ *(edit: maybe I am high after all...)* **59%** less business for criminals than they have now, seing as they have the entire market.

No weed was sold to kids by legal dealers, so child cannabis use did not increase. 

Marijuana use did increase - obviously - but only from [10.4% of the state's population to 12.7%](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27212493/marijuana-use-increases-colorado-according-new-federal-survey).

DUIs increased, but not by a whole lot and there are still far fewer DUIs involving weed as involving alcohol by a factor of about 75.

Overall, it provided a boon to the economy and prevented a lot of people from going to prison for something which is [arguably less dangerous than smoking and drinking](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11433448/Cannabis-is-many-times-less-dangerous-than-alcohol-claims-study.html) (and in any case, is a victimless crime seeing as the only one harmed is the user), saving the taxpayer millions in prison expenses and helping prevent prison overcrowding.

I don't even smoke weed, but the argument for its legalization is compelling. I'm a strong believer in individual freedom, and to my mind nobody should see jail time for putting something into their own body in the privacy of their own home (bear in mind public use remained an offence so you don't need to worry about you or your kid getting a second hand high walking down the street). And when the stats show that legalization takes business away from criminals and gives the government shitloads of tax revenue (not to mention it creates jobs, obviously, as a new sector of industry is opened up and it requires employees) it's very hard to argue against.

(Edit: also bear in mind it's legal weed, not mandatory weed. If you don't want to smoke it, its legalization doesn't affect you in the slightest. You might think I'm being ridiculous, but that was an argument used against gay marriage - that it would negatively impact straight marriages. No, it doesn't, and neither does weed legalization impact non smokers.)

It would be quite easy to pay for it; the cost of providing higher education hasn't changed (except for the natural increase of inflation) over the entire period from the introduction of tuition fees. The grants have simply been shunted off on to loans; however, not only do these loans still cost the government money up front, even the last government (who have every reason to be optimistic) estimated last year that *at least* 45% of the loans will *never* be repaid. This figure could well prove higher as we move on into the future. It would require very little re-jigging of the budget; I haven't seen (and couldn't find) figures for how much the government gets back from student loan repayments per annum, but given the graduate jobs situation I suspect it to be negligible. This is exactly an example of the sort of thing I mean by having an opposition leader who is able to challenge the consensus; the student loans system hasn't really saved the government much money at all, and it hasn't improved the higher education system at all, or increased the value of a degree. More people are simply going to university, pulling out loans that many of them won't repay. The only advantage of student loans is that they help to satisfy neoliberal ideology by turning higher education more into a business (as it is in the US) and thus helping to depoliticise universities and students, politicised students being one of the groups the conservatives most detest, for whatever reason.

&gt;They are sceptical of immigration, so how can he say ""I'm for the working class, but like immigration"". He also has the student vote, possibly the more fickle voters of the lot. 

Part of the reason that people are sceptical about immigration is because, again, no major party has the guts to fight the utter nonsense peddled by the right wing press. We know that, in the real world, immigration has almost no measurable effect on people's employment prospects, and studies commissioned by the last government have shown that, far from restricting immigration, we need to encourage it at higher levels in order to avoid a serious demographic timebomb from our aging population. Unless the tories also want to institute some sort of quasi-fascistic program to encourage British families to have more children (an unlikely prospect given their slashing of child support benefits) then their policy goals are utterly unsustainable, and this needs to be bought into the public discourse. The student vote is only 'fickle' because pretty much every party who's courted it in recent years has seen fit to betray the core issues they garnered it with. The abandonment of the Lib Dems by students wasn't some sort of random whim; it was an absolutely predictable consequence of their reneging on the core issue that they had used to get that support in the first place, in just about the most spectacular way possible. 

Personally, I wouldn't consider a Labour split that bad a thing. As you say, I don't rate their prospects in 2020 under first past the post very highly at all, which is why I brought up voting reform. I think Labour's best prospect over the next fifteen years is to throw themselves behind voting reform alongside the SNP, Lib Dems, Greens and UKIP. This would lead to the possibility of Labour as a major coalition partner going into the future. Under such conditions, Labour could even survive ideological splits, as long as the parts were still willing to work together in government. A red-green-regions alliance would probably represent the political left in this country best, and would have beaten the Tories out just in the last election's results, even before we take into account the shifts in voting under such a system.",null,0,null,1437996303,null,0,false,0,cthn2lj,null,t3_3eoeqs,null,t1_cthn2lj,null,t1_cthmn4n,null,null,null,1440111017,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

The point is people can be jailed and lifes ruined for possession (even if you don't go to jail your life can still be ruined) people are still frequently jailed for growing it (max sentence 14 years), whilst a worse drug is available in shops/pubs up and down the country - which is not logical or fair and also costs us all tax money which could be spent elsewhere

The existing law harms society (by allowing criminal gangs to profit) and often weed is sold with harmful substances sprayed on it to weight it down (making it far less safe) - i.e silica. - Surely the country is crying out for more money (rather than allowing criminals to profit)

null,false,trimun,null,null,null,"Its been a long while since I was actively reading about it. The most interesting studies which show the harm caused by cannabis are the one that showed its degenerative effects on developing brains, and an Australian study that showed smokers who roll cannabis and tobacco together (a joint, how it is commonly smoked in our country) have higher incidences of social, mental and health problems than smokers of either substance alone; although users who smoked cannabis on its own showed far less of this damage than the other two groups.

But even studies which show the harmful effects of the substance can be argued to be in favour of legalisation; teenagers have far easier access to cannabis than, say, alcohol. Actually putting it under government controls and adding an age limit similar to the way we sell tobacco and alcohol would make it far harder for those most vulnerable to its degenerative effects to access it. Secondly, the reason cannabis is so commonly smoked with tobacco in our country is because of the price and the strength, both of which would decrease under legalisation, as alcohol did under prohibition.

I'm sorry I can't remember the names of the studies or who they were by, these two articles are by far the most damning studies of the drug I have read; and as I explained above the most damning aspects are the fact that the drug is prohibited and therefore the domain of black marketeers.

I'm sure you can find many 'pro' arguments yourself, the most convincing of which (from a non-smokers standpoint) would be a cost-benefit analysis and harm reduction. From the view of a CBA we stop spending money trying to combat something people are going to do regardless and start gaining money from people who currently give it to black marketeers to go towards whatever; could be more plants, could be bringing guns and women into the country, who knows?

You can probably tell which camp I'm in, but I assure you I've done the reading to get to this point. I've had my problems with cannabis as much as I have had with alcohol and tobacco; and honestly I think the mental side-effects of alcohol are worse than cannabis, though this is rarely talked about.

It seems to me that the 'anti' camp tends to fall on non-science and scaremongering, the sacking of David Nutt and the 'reform' of the ACMD so that membership no longer required a scientific background showed, to me, that our government's policy is not founded on evidence but simply an agenda.

By Robert Mendick, Chief Reporter


A Cambridge Professor has made the astonishing claim that three scientists investigating the melting of Arctic ice may have been assassinated within the space of a few months.

Professor Peter Wadhams said he feared being labelled a âlooneyâ over his suspicion that the deaths of the scientists were more than just an âextraordinaryâ coincidence.

But he insisted the trio could have been murdered and hinted that the oil industry or else sinister government forces might be implicated.

The three scientists he identified - Seymour Laxon and Katherine Giles, both climate change scientists at University College London, and Tim Boyd of the Scottish Association for marine Science - all died within the space of a few months in early 2013.

Professor laxon fell down a flight of stairs at a New yearâs Eve party at a house in Essex while Dr Giles died when she was in collision with a lorry when cycling to work in London. Dr Boyd is thought to have been struck by lightning while walking in Scotland.

Prof Wadhams said that in the weeks after Prof Laxonâs death he believed he was targeted by a lorry which tried to force him off the road. He reported the incident to the police.

Asked if he thought hitmen might have been behind the deaths, Prof Wadhams, who is Professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, told The Telegraph: âYes. I do believe assassins possibly murdered them but I can see that I would be thought of as a looney for believing this.

""But itâs just very odd coincidence that something like that should happen in such a brief period of time.â

He added: âThey [the deaths] were accidents as far as anybody was able to tell but the fact they were clustered like that looked so weird.â

Asked who might have wanted them out the way, he replied: âI can only think of the oil lobby but I donât think the oil lobby goes around killing people.â

He admitted it would have been ""stupid"" to go to the police with his concerns over the three deaths, not least because he was ""suspicious"" of the authorities - he cited the example of the death of the governmentâs weapons expert Dr David Kelly.

Prof Wadhams added: âI thought if it was somebody assassinating them could it be one of our people doing it and that would be even more frightening. I thought it would be better not to touch this with a barge pole.â

His suspicions drew outrage on Saturday from Prof Laxonâs partner, who was also a close friend of Dr Giles. When told what Prof Wadhams had said, Fiona Strawbridge, head of e-Learning at UCL, replied: âGood god. All of this is completely outrageous and very distressing.â

The couple had been staying in a friendsâ converted mill in the Essex countryside when her partner fell down the stairs in the early hours of New Yearâs Day. He died the next day from head injuries.

âIt was very steep stairs and I heard Seymour fall,â said Ms Strawbridge, âIt is just completely bonkers [to suggest murder].

""I am sure there are some climate scientists who do get trolled and pursued but Seymour wasnât one of them. I would have known if anybody had been pursuing him.

âSometimes there are tragic coincidences and you have to accept that.â

Investing in stocks yourself is both time consuming and risky. Most professional fund managers don't beat the ftse 100, so as a private individual there is no reason to think you can either, other than luck. 

Lifestyle tracker funds invest in lots of different stocks, bonds and other investment vehicles globally. This will then constantly be rebalanced to achieve good diversification as individual elements go up and down. All you need to do is put money into it and forget about it, the hard work is done for you. 

Typically they have various versions for different risk profiles which change the allocation between stocks and bonds. Vanguard life strategy is commonly recommended here due to their low fees and variety of options. If you are young and looking to get long term capital growth over 10-20 years then you're probably best looking at the higher risk funds like 100/0 or 80/20. If you are looking to access the money earlier or for older people approaching retirement it's normally better to consider the lower risk funds with a higher bond allocation eg the 20/80.

There's a whole range of Conservatives who'll be strongly for it (on liberal, free market grounds) and strongly against it (on conservative grounds). Labour will be equally divided. The SNP, Green, and the DUP will all want to make contributions. There's easily enough interest for a debate to last many hours. 

One of the nice things about having so many different parties now, is that you can guarantee that in an open debate a lot of interesting perspectives will actually be put forward (rather than two monstrous blocs which are tightly controlled by the party whips with a handful of unaffiliated MPs in the middle, which is what we had until recently).

To cover a few points:

Bike insurance is pretty cheap - and given you are already liable for injuring a pedestrian in an accident with all the associated risks, it's probably worth having it already.

With any current accident you have to be able to prove it wasn't your fault if challenged - so you need witnesses on your side, or dashcams, or something similar.  With the change in the law this would still be true. The only incidents that are affected are those where there is no obviously attributable fault, and neither side can present evidence for the other side's responsibility. In these, all things being even, the more dangerous vehicle type pays.

I think people should decide for themselves.

I don't think people are capable of deciding for themselves.

If people could just ""make a decision"" why would you end up having ""interventions"" or, respite and rehab clinics? People can't make decisions when they're affected by substances to the point of dependency. You can educate and offer services to help those who fall into that trap, but then you have to watch people ""not care"" or hide problems. It isn't as straight forward you're making it sound, and you know that.

&gt; I dont see how people can be comfortable with the government telling you what you can and cant put into your body.

That's a different question altogether but let me offer my thoughts. I pay taxes so my government can employ people smarter than me to investigate this. They can turn around and tell me ""hey, sugar is pretty bad for your teeth - brush your teeth more often and lay off the coke as we've got evidence that it's bad for you"" and the same principle applies to cannabis.

I like Professor David Nutt, and his independent body for drug harm and research... I can't argue with his findings that cannabis isn't a dangerous drug, and no-one has died from an overdose of it, etc. But people and specifically Reddit is incredibly vocal about his work - and it's an echo-chamber; complete confirmation bias. The entire catalogue of research on cannabis also has a massive fucking caveat on the type of people who use cannabis, their emotional state at the point of administration, along with profiling of their psychological build and outlook. The TL;DR is simple: if you're in a good position in life, you can probably use cannabis with minimal short term side effects. Long term side effects are unknown, and when smoked with tobacco, it is worse than straight cannabis. Will affects development of young teens, and so on.

So I will pay my taxes and listen to educated, medical professionals who can tell me if it's ""bad for me"" or not.

&gt; There are around 3 million adult weed users in the uk, knowing that i dont see how you can think that none of them have an appetite for moving forward with their lives.

I didn't say that. I said my personal indirect experience has been precisely that. I'm not an idiot and I know it doesn't affect everyone in that way - but hey, we as a population are eating less sugar (but I'm sure eating copious amounts of sugar doesn't affect everybody, right?), smoking less tobacco (but I'm sure there are elderly folk out there who've been smoking 50 years and it hasn't done them any harm) , drinking less alcohol (I'm 30 and I don't have liver disease), and exercising more every day.

It's not only the ""potential"", he's extremely composed on the ball, passes as you'd expect any of your cb's to do (as good as Sakho) but also can do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnJM5bhf2ns and https://youtu.be/KpXx-uYofKM?t=179 (Lovren tries this and fails constantly but reminiscent of Sakho) 

His positioning is incredible, he's rapid, tall and it seems after forming an understanding with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Oliveira they made a formidable partnership at the latest u21 tourny, only conceding 1 goal to Sweden in extra time in the groups.

I hope to god he signs the contract extension, however I also hoped he would jump straight from the U21 tourny into preseason rather than taking the holiday, really showing what he's capable of, but it's understandable wanting to see his family. I feel as if he could even slot into the defensive midfielder position, but that's a whole different topic.
Obviously he is only human and has made mistakes, as has Sakho, but when watching them you can see they ooze class and that they understand how to play football. I am also not bashing Skrtel, he's been a good servant to the club, however his mistakes are far more frequent - as are Lovrens when he gets the chance to play.

&gt; ""That's a very interesting question actually. I haven't thought about that [*whether or not he is a Marxist*] for a long time. I haven't really read as much of Marx as I should have done. I've read quite a bit, but not that much. And I think Marx's transition of history, and the analysis of how you go from feudalism to capitalism and move on to a different stage is fascinating. So we all owe something to him. Probably inside you, even you do.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""He was essentially a fascinating figure who observed a great deal, and from whom we can learn a great deal.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""I'm not talking about the Labour Party being a revolutionary party. It certainly isn't. What we're doing here is putting forward a view that the Labour Party has to offer a credible alternative that is true to the roots of the Labour Party. The roots of the Labour Party are essentially democratic, essentially socialist, essentially community. What we were offering for the past 5, 10 years has been essentially austerity lite, essentially cuts.""

Corbyn seems to have read Marx, understands the influence and importance of his writing, both upon himself and the world, but clearly isn't willing to align himself with that specific doctrine. So if you want a one-word answer, I think it is 'no'.

As for *why* he didn't say he wasn't a Marxist, perhaps he overestimated the intelligence of some viewers who seem to want to pigeonhole his politics via simple yes/no answers.

I like Corbyn a lot, but he needs to learn that nuanced replies don't work when the right-wing press, or certain Redditors, just want to point and screech ""A MARXIST! HE'S A MARXIST!"" I can't speak for Corbyn (and nor can anyone here, so I don't really know why you're pursuing this tedious line of questioning) but from his answers I inferred that his politics are less Marxist than democratic socialist. He was fairly clear about that, but maybe not clear enough for the likes of you.

But hey, instead of nagging random Redditors for answers, why don't you reach out on Twitter or email and ask Corbyn himself?

Corporation Tax will be raised by 2% (What additional revenue will that generate?) and in return it will be used for....

&gt; "".....investment in learning from cradle to grave. A National Education Service would be every bit as vital and as free at the point of use as our NHS, and should be delivered by the end of the next Parliament.""

So, we already have a free at the point of use main education system which runs from the age of 4/5 years old to A-Levels (Is there a cutoff age at the moment after which you have to pay? I know my brother didn't finish his A-levels until he was around 20-21 and never had to pay to attend) Would there be any changes here? What about Universities? Scrapping Fees? Restoring grants?

&gt; ""In 2020 we should start by reversing the cuts to the adult skills budget""

OK, what does that do? Or is that the basis of the NES idea?

&gt; ""The case for investing in early years education towards universal free childcare is overwhelming.""

I'm guessing that this is alluding to further increasing free child-care allowances, I'm on board with that... It's currently 15 hours a week from when the kid turns 2 or 3 until they are 4 years old (And starts attending school). I think the Conservative manifesto had in it that it would be increased to 30 hours per week by the end of their term. What should it be?

&gt; ""A National Education Service will give working age people access throughout their lives to learn new skills or to re-train. It should also work with Jobcentre Plus to offer claimants opportunities to improve their skills, rather than face the carousel of workfare placements, sanctions and despair.""

So it sounds like this is aimed at allowing people to study for qualifications at any point in their life? Is that not already possible? There were definitely people in their 30s/40s/50s in some of my college classes years back. Or would it be separate institutions set-up purely for adult learning/retraining? Does it only apply to people who are ""in need"" of retraining or involved in the JobCentre Plus cycle? Or can I quit my job and decide to take a free at the point of use A-level in psychology if I start wanting to do something different in 20 years time?

&gt; ""It is clear that some employers are using apprenticeships and traineeships as a means of circumventing minimum wage legislation. This has to end. The minimum wage must be equalised across the board â with no poverty rates like the current Â£2.73 per hour apprenticeship rate.""

So getting rid of the apprenticeship rate and equalising it to the minimum wage, seems very reasonable to me - Is this to be done by a government top-up of the wage or just changing the law so employers have to pay at least the minimum wage to apprentices?

We have two scenarios: war/conflict and peace. War/conflict is (unfortunately) segregated into us and them. Peace is not.

**War/Conflict**

NATO - not the British Government - **murdered** journalists during the Serbian **war**. The people they killed were Serbian (**us/them**). 

In Chechnya, the Russian Government is suspected of killing a significant amount of Russian journalists who were outspoken on atrocities being committed by Russian troops and Russian policy during the **war**. From a Russian perspective, the people assassinated were '**Us/Us**'.

In the troubles, there were three forces at play (IRA, Unionists, British Army). I can't find any examples, but I will say for devils advocates sake that a few journalists were killed on all sides, but as far as I know, no British journalists were killed or suspected to have been killed by the British Gov for speaking out against British Gov policy during the **conflict**. 

Martin O'Hagan was ex IRA, who, decades after the Troubles finished, ran a series of exposÃ©s on drug dealing amongst Loyalist groups, and subsequently was murdered. I think his ex status as an 'actor' in the conflict blurs the lines somewhat here, but at a stretch you could say this was overhang from the **conflict** (us/them) 

**Peace**

In Britain, we have had Jill Dando murdered that is unresolved but suspicious. As far as I know, our persecution of journalists is restricted to gagging. 

In Russia, the murder of journalists and politicians who speak out against Putin is still alarmingly frequent. 

I think Hastings is irrelevant to this discussion as he is American and we are talking about Britain. We could also say the NATO example is irrelevant as NATO is an American dominated institution. 

I am sorry to delve into semantics here, but this is a **British journalist** comparing the **British Governments** treatment of journalists as being the same as Russia, which is almost every single conceivable method of interpretation is absolute bollocks. 

The west has done a lot of dirt, but the west is broader than Britian. Britain has done a lot of dirt, but we are talking about journalists here. Not an investigation into broad geopolitical morality.

Russia kills journalists who get brave... We gag them.

Where is the evidence that they produce well educated individuals rather than perpetuate privilege regardless of academic success or mediocrity?

Quite staggering considering the overwhelming disadvantage that comprehensive school students face compared to their privately educated peers.

Would that be the honesty to say, '[Labour need to win votes from the Conservatives to win elections](http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-mountain-to-climb/)'? If so, there's three candidates you could vote for! Which one could he mean?

&gt;The choice that now presents itself is between substance and the complete lack of it

'Substance' in this case meaning, 'agreeing with my views'. Liz Kendall has been very clear about what she wants: A high-wage economy driven by greater trade union membership and incentives for corporations to pay the living wage so that we don't *have to* pay out lots of money in welfare and tax credits. I'm not saying that's a flawless vision or even a vote-winning vision. But does it lack substance?

&gt;at the next election, I want someone who closely represents my political ideals to be leading the Opposition

Yes, and, after the election, I want someone who closely represents my political ideals to be leading the *Government*.

&gt;Corbyn seems to represent the principled left, unsullied by the need to appeal to every voter

I sometimes wonder whether these people have thought about the word 'democracy'. Imagine a 'democracy' where politicians uniformly 'didn't feel the need to appeal to voters'. Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it? The fact that most politicians feels the need to appeal to us is *a sign that we live in a democracy*. But, according to this guy, 'appealing to voters' means 'sullying yourself'. That is disgustingly elitist.

&gt;If Corbyn wins, it may well be political suicide for Labour, or it may not. But if he would rather go down with his ship than drown in the morass of Tory-with-a-whiff-of-Labour policies and insinuated promises, then I am happy to go down with him

And, here's the kicker. 'It doesn't matter if we win!' yells Louis Norman, 'My belief in helping the poor is so strong that I won't compromise! Ever! Even if compromising will allow us to actually help the poor and not compromising will ensure that we can never help the poor! Neoliberal consensus! War criminals! Blairites!'

null,false,hoochdog,lfc68,,null,"Rodgers has his pros and cons, but I think it is fair to say that neither the highs of 2 seasons ago nor the lows of last seasons are entirely his fault.  However, he is partly to blame on both of those.  The buck needs to stop with the manager.

In mitigation, 2 seasons ago, Liverpool has the best player in the EPL by some distance in Suarez, and Sturridge and Coutinho were both largely fit most of the time (at least by Sturridge's standards).  Marry that to confidence throughout the squad, and the style of football Rodgers wanted, and we nearly won the league with Iago Aspas!

Last season, we lost Sturridge for most of the season, had lost Suarez without replacing him, had Raheem Sterling disrupting himself if not the rest of the squad, and consequently played most of the season with no recognised Striker, or Balotelli - who for all his effort or otherwise has not yet looked the part. Simultaneously we looked for tactics that would fit the squad, briefly found some until the rest of the EPL figured out how to stop them, and we regressed as a result.

You could argue that Rodgers instilled the confidence in the squad 2 seasons ago - his insistence on fast flowing, high pressing football and pushing teams onto the back foot certainly helped (Arsenal at Anfield being the standout example).

Similarly, you might say he could've managed the squad better last season, especially in respect to morale, Sterling, and attacking threat.

However, I think the biggest thing that excuses Rodgers (if anything does) is that by performing so well two seasons ago, Liverpool entered the Champions League last year with a squad that wasn't ready, a manager that wasn't experienced, and without  a fit recognised striker other than Balotelli). If Liverpool had reinvested the fee from selling Suarez into a suitable replacement (who still wouldn't have been another Suarez, just a better player than any other we could've got), then the squad depth wouldn't have been enough for the Champions League. As it was, we bought depth and potential, and as a result, the squad wasn't good enough for the Champions League.

Is Rodgers to blame for the signings? Well he says as much, even when he hints he didn't really fancy Balotelli. All signings must be OK'ed by him if he is to believed.

Personally, I think we have had a much better window this summer. We have a very difficult first few months of the season to come.  The time to judge Rodgers fairly will be at the turn of the year - how has the squad coped with a difficult first few away games, how has it coped with Europa League, how are the new signings settling in, are we less reliant on one or two individuals, can we protect those key players who can't play every minute of every season, are we looking like a cohesive team, is there clear leadership on the pitch, are we winning games?

Given the difficulties of last season, these are the answers I want to see that I think are under Rodgers' control.

null,false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"&gt;Where is the evidence that they produce well educated individuals rather than perpetuate privilege regardless of academic success or mediocrity? Many studies have shown that comprehensive school students actually do better at university than private school students, despite private school students going on to earn more. Quite staggering considering the overwhelming disadvantage that comprehensive school students face compared to their privately educated peers.

That's a pretty obvious conclusion to draw from the Guardian and not even the least bit ""staggering"". Students who can achieve the same grades despite more difficult circumstances are smarter. *Really*? I'd never have guessed.

That's not even remotely a case against private schools. All you're showing is something that's blatantly obvious anyway: if you're smarter you get better grades. All private schools do is remove some of those difficulties, such as disruptive, uninterested or undisciplined peers.

&gt;If the children of the wealthy and privileged were integrated into the comprehensive school system then you can bet that their influence would cause the comprehensive school system overnight, thereby improving the position of all children rather than just their own.

Or you're throwing those kids into a more difficult environment than they'd otherwise need to be in for the sake of lowering the percentage total of troublesome kids.

Again, that's not fixing the problem at all and isn't the fault of private schooling. You're advocating *diluting* a problem, not *fixing it*. Putting rich kids into state schools won't magically solve the life problems that the kids from the  rough council estate have.

&gt;Who does and doesn't get quality education should not be assigned by the market.

You could say that about everything the market touches. Will we outlaw private health providers like BUPA, too? Is it really fair that rich people can afford to buy more expensive but healthier food? Is it even fair that state schools with catchment areas dominated by privately-owned homes are often significantly better than those in areas dominated by poverty? What are you going to do, bus kids between schools to even all that out?

You're not even attempting to fix the problem, you're just aiming to punish people who have the money to *avoid* the problem. Again, your attitude is nothing but ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". You don't want to actually fix the problem, you just want to drag everyone down to that level in the hopes that diluting the problem will make it less problematic.

It wouldn't even help anyway. Those with money will just price the poor out of catchment areas around good schools and you'll have the exact same disparity that you have right now but the Government will foot the bill instead of rich parents.

Private schools are win-win. They don't operate on catchment areas and the parents sending their kids there pay taxes all the same, meaning more money per kid actually in a state school.

worse, there is no evidence for this whatsoever. In fact although legalisation doesnt seem to lower the number

weed legalisation anyway, weed isnt physically addictive and isnt anywhere near as mentally addictive as 
harder drugs. There are very few rehab clinins for weed in the world, simply because not many people need
to go to rehab to get off weed.

I agree with you that people the government employ know far more about this than me and are in a much better
position to make a decision on the matter, however in the past the government has gone against expert opinion 
on several occasions. Even then it comes back to the point that you should be able to decide what you do to
yourself as long as it doesnt harm others. Ecucation on the risks involved with different drugs is a much
better option that banning them, and obviously the best people to educate us are the experts who the 
government employ. It bothers me when people claim we live in a free society when it is so clear that we
dont.

last point. The government didnt put a legal limit to how much sugar, alcohol, tobacco you can take or how much

More and more British people are turning away from religion whilst being exposed to some of the most pious people we've ever encountered.  Although the reality is that most of us are growing tired of organised religion, the narrative is that Islam is causing all the problems.  (I don't think it is a coincidence that it rivals Christianity as a chief proselytiser either.)

The best way to deal with the issue is to encourage loving conflict by means of discussion and acceptance.  A Muslim is very unlikely to accept the facets of your humanity if you don't try to accept theirs.

&gt; That's not even remotely a case against private schools. All you're showing is something that's blatantly obvious anyway: if you're smarter you get better grades.
&gt; 

Great, so wouldn't these children flourish *even more* if they were given something approaching the resources afforded to the privately educated? Don't they deserve the same, or more similar, opportunities after their academic achievements which are afforded to people who are academically mediocre but have the right tie?

&gt;Or you're throwing those kids into a more difficult environment than they'd otherwise need to be in for the sake of lowering the percentage total of troublesome kids.
Again, that's not fixing the problem at all and isn't the fault of private schooling. You're advocating diluting a problem, not fixing it.

No, you're removing the right of the rich to a lifeboat away from the majority of the population. If the richest, the most influential in society, believe that they have no stake in public services then they aren't going to care whether or not they are defunded, but if they have to use them then they will ensure that they are better than they are now. In any case, it's not very good or healthy for people to deliberately exclude themselves from the rest of society, it's demeaning to both the children of the rich and the majority and dehumanises both in the eyes of the other.

&gt;You could say that about everything the market touches. Will we outlaw private health providers like BUPA, too? ad nauseum

I don't see why the existence of other inequalities mean that this inequality is more justifiable. 

&gt;There are ways to fix problems within state schools, ways I proposed in my original post. You ignored that entire post to whine about some class-warfare-esque beef with private schooling.

Why would any of these, uncosted a la what you accuse Corbyn of *gasp*, changes happen when those in charge of implementing them send their children to their private school lifeboat?

When life isn't going so good, I smoke, and when life doesn't get any better, I smoke some more; sometimes I'll have a good period and then I'll fall back in. I believe I can get to a point where my usage is of the more harmless kind, moderated, and I can smoke as little as I drink alcohol (parties, weekends).

null,false,calculusprime,null,null,null,"&gt;your ethno-tribal biased attitude toward SF

&gt;how are more cuts going to help the large percentage of working class we have here in the north?

Ok, you make two main assertions there. I'll take each in turn.

**1) My ridiculing of SF must be based on ethno-tribalism**

No. Its based on: 
a) their continued defence and glorification of violence as a legitimate means of furthering one's political aspirations, and 
b) their promotion of clapped-out tried-to-destruction leftist economic orthodoxies. 

Both of these dismal anachronisms continue to reap terrible socio-economic results on the long suffering people of Northern Ireland.

As for other nationalist parties, I have respect for the SDLP as a party that has always nominally committed itself to achieving its aspirations by purely peaceful means (though I do have semi-regular occasion to bemoan their current leadership for permitting the party to squander that legacy by allowing it to collude in SF's policies of terrorist playground naming and such like).

Beyond that, I have quite a lot of time for Fine Gael, even if it is nominally a party with nationalist aspirations. I have respect for their economic pragmatism and willingness to hold out a mature hand of friendship to the UK.

You might like to paint all critics of SF as ""blinded by sectarian agendas"" but it is worth considering that it might be equally conceivable that the criticism is borne of an entirely rational set of objections.

**2) Public finance readjustment must, inevitably, be injurious to the lot of the working class**

I take by working class, you're excluding then people who aren't actually working? i.e. you're not talking about the welfare debate?

What then is ""the working class"", it not being 19th century industrial Europe anymore?

We'll take from Christopher Doob's (2013) rough definition, that you're referring to unskilled labourers, artisans and factory workers.

How might more 'cuts' (or 'public finance adjustment', take your emotive or non-emotive term of choice) help such people?

- By keeping interest rates on their mortgages and borrowing steady and lower (interest rates would rocket if international markets believed the UK had lost control of its public finances)

- By keeping control over our economy and government out of the dead grip of IMF dictatorship (compare and contrast with Greece who decided it best not to keep responsible management of public expenditure... oops)

- For workers in the private sector, reigning in the public sector releases opportunities for private sector growth. Many small businesses in NI, especially in the service sector, simply can't compete with the public sector for graduate talent in terms of salary and benefits offer.

- For workers in the public sector, there needs to be a realisation that 28% of the population being employed in the public sector is simply not financially sustainable, anywhere in the world. In any case, switching to employment in the private sector, while admittedly less of a cushty deal on the whole, does generally tend to promise greater wage growth potential and financial reward in the long term.

Public finance adjustment really need not be an apocalyptic scenario if politicians take a wise, grown-up and pragmatic approach to it.

Covering one's eyes and going 'la-la-la-la-la-I-cant-see-the-public-finance-balance-sheets' might just lead to fairly apocalyptic situations on the other hand.

Just ask some people in Greece.

I would suggest to you in fact that it is Sinn Fein who tend to do the most injury to the working class by insisting on promoting out-dated anti-private sector anti-capitalist policy tosh, that reaps no positive reward for job opportunities or wage growth.

Just look what their near-monopoly political control of West Belfast for several decades has managed to achieve for the area...

Judge politicians on what they achieve in actual human and economic terms, not on the rhetorical splendour of their Peoples Front of Judea pronouncements.

Sinn Fein has certainly NOT produced a prosperous West Belfast for ANY of the identities, faiths and individuals living there.

We've no basis therefore to believe they can do very much on economic issues for anyone else, on the island of Ireland, or elsewhere.

Hence just like Miliband, Foot could unify the party but could offer no coherent message; they lived in a contradiction of half opposition to the measures of austerity or Thatcherism and half supporting them. (Michael Owen of the SDP slit explicitly said last week on Newsnight the split was caused by policy and not M. Foot, i.e. the policy incoherence of Foot which I mention).

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"If we intend to have a proper discussion on this, it depends on what we mean by Marxism.

 If by Marxist, we mean he supports Marx's ideas that:

* Capitalism leads to the alienation of groups of people
* That, under capitalism, segments of society exploit other segments of society
* That capitalism cannot maintain the living standards of the population
* That industry should move towards co-operative ownership
* That the country should focus more on what satisfy human needs rather than on private profits.

Then yes, Corbyn is a Marxist, as is Liz Kendall, as is Yvette Cooper, as is Andy Burnham, as is over half the Labour party.

(Of course, classical Marxism also advocates the idea that socialism is inevitable and that the proletariat will rise up in revolution. I have omitted this because a) We can all agree Corbyn isn't trying to be a revolutionary and b) Marx suggested this before universal suffrage became a thing, and he believed that as the upper classes controlled the government, there was no hope the governments would look after the working-class. Later in his life, he rescinded this view, noting how society had changed towards universal suffrage and came round to the belief that socialism could come about through democratic reform)

Now if you mean Leninism/Marxism-Leninism (i.e. the political ideology that the Soviet Union said is the only legitimate development of Marxism), then that depends on the particular aspect. If we take the social aspects of:

* Support for a universal social welfare system.
* Improving public education and health systems
* Provision of child care
* Provision of benefits
* Ending the exploitation of women

Then Corbyn supports those as does the entire Labour party and some members of the Tory party... If we mean the social aspects of

* abolition of private property
* The use of propaganda to teach people to abide by the ideals of communism

Then he does not support these.

If we take the economic aspect of Marxism-Leninism that:

* Market forces should be replaced with scientific planning
* That the value of a good or service should be determined by its use value
* That wages should be set according to the skill and intensity of the work
* That all industry should be under state ownership.

Then Corbyn couldn't be any further from this. As far as I am aware he has never advocated a change in the way that goods should valued or wages set. And although he believe natural monopolies and major infrastructure should come under public ownership, he seems to support the idea that private businesses and corporations should be allowed to exist.

If we take the political aspect of Marxism-Leninism that

* The state should be controlled by a single-party of Marxism-Leninism principles
* The use of a vanguard party to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat

Then Corbyn absolutely does not support this. If anything, he supports further reform to allow more parties to have influence.

tl;dr Discussions on whether someone is or isn't a Marxist are complicated by the fact that Marxism is an incredibly broad church of beliefs ranging from the very fringes of the far left, to aspects of the One Nation Conservative vision. Ultimately, its meaningless to call someone a Marxist in the 21st century as all being Marxist means is that you think capitalism leads to a significant chunk of people being worse off and that something should be done about it.

EDIT: I think the revolutionary aspect of Marx's original philosophy is something that is overstressed not only by opponents wishing to denigrate socialism, but by left-wing nutjobs who wish to justify their desire for violence, in both cases missing the historical context in which Marx uttered those words. You have to remember, at the time Marx came up with the Communist Manifesto, the majority of Europe was either an absolute monarchy or, at best, ran democracies that heavily weighted in favour of votes by landed gentry (hell up until 1948, property owners effectively got two votes in the UK). At the time, it would have been inconceivable that a government would move towards helping those who are living on the bottom rung of society as they didn't depend on the working class to remain in power. Therefore, to Marx, revolution would have been the only option. 24 years after publishing the Communist Manifesto, Marx admitted that in developed countries ""labour may attain its goal by peaceful means"", suggesting he had stood down from the idea that revolution was necessary.",null,0,null,1438004009,null,0,1438006089,0,cthpyjv,null,t3_3erji9,null,t1_cthpyjv,null,t3_3erji9,null,null,null,1440112444,null,8,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,8,null

If this was introduced I can see this becoming more common, harryman100 raised that point.  
I know the change applies to civil and not criminal cases but in the real world that doesn't matter. If I had a civil case against me then it would affect my insurance costs, my employability*, my reputation, etc, and all when I had done nothing wrong. I don't want to sound like a 5 year old but its not fair. I know the current system isn't perfect but this change makes it uneven. If neither side can present evidence for either sides responsibility then there isn't a case and a decision cannot be reached. To do so on the basis of nothing makes no sense to me.  
I said on the original thread that technology will find a solution faster than discussion and I stand by that. 360 degree cameras are available for car and trucks, add a recording feature and any discussion of liability is moot. Given this would not a better solution be the making of cameras a legal requirement for road vehicles. Don't mess with the current legal system just provide it with the information required to reach the correct solution.

I can also have a custom BIOS on the card that ups the power limit (and nothing else) or any help on a BIOS that you need if you buy this card or I can just leave the BIOS stock :D]

Any questions, please PM!

null,false,Naugrith,null,null,null,"The question is one of those nasty little traps that some people like to force interviewees to answer purely to generate attention-grabbing headlines. They demand a yes/no response in the full knowledge that if the interviewee answers either yes *or* no it will harm their cause. If he just says he isn't a marxist then lots of lefties will think he's betrayed his roots and stop supporting him. If he says he is a marxist then lots of people will think he's a raving communist who wants to whip up a mob of workers to storm the winter palace. 

It's the same as the classic ""have you stopped beating your wife?"" which can't be answered straight *without* coming across as a wife-beater. There's also the classic example from the Bible when the Pharisees tried to to trap Jesus by asking him whether it was right to pay taxes or not. If he said 'yes' it would have made him look like he was supporting the Roman occupation, and 'no' would make him look like a terrorist. He answered cleverly but he had to dodge the question to do it.

This type of questioning is a low trick and most clever people can talk themselves out of the trap that's been set. However, not giving a straight answer or refusing to answer a trap question is also seen as negative nowadays, and many people who don't realise what the interviewer has done just see that and get upset by it. Then the interviewee has been put into a complete no-win situation. 

These no-win interviewing tactics are ruining national politics IMO. Many interviews now are just being turned into a battle to make the interviewee look bad. What the hell is the point of that?

Getting top 4 shouldn't be too difficult this season given the work that we've seen the club do this summer - signings after signings, new back room staff to support Rodgers which ultimately culminates in a sense of absolute trust in him.

&gt; Liverpoolâs charge was led by Suarez, Gerrard and Sturridge. With 65 goals and 32 assists between them, they were at the centre of most things good for Liverpool this season. Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson were also influential and Martin Skrtel ended the season as the highest scoring defender in the league.

He even made it into the Guardian's 5 player shortlist for player of the season with Terry, Yaya Toure, Hazard and Suarez

Me neither anymore.  My sister in law lives in Italy and when we went to visit (not long after my Delia story) they made us some spaghetti with tomato sauce made from a tin and it it awesome!  So I usually use tinned now and get pretty great results.


&gt;even as an experienced cook, I often find myself wondering wtf dimension of ""pudding basin"" a British recipe is calling for, wondering if ""roast until golden"" will take more like 30 minutes or more like 90 minutes, or scoffing at a recipe calling for ""a good lashing"" of some ingredient instead of a volumetric amount.

We brits have a pretty poor reputation when it comes to cooking and food in general.  From what I've read this started with Mrs Beaton and her famous cook book.  Until then we would cook in the manner you describe without exact quantities, and words like 'lashing' of this, or a 'sprinkle' of that.  It was expected that the cook would be familiar with and competent enough to use the correct amounts of whatever ingredient.  Beaton started using exact measurements as we see today, and somewhat put a stop to experimentation I guess.  

Then world war 2 happened and food became scarce.   Everyone got used to boring uninspiring foods and didn't complain, because they were just happy to be eating - and the ""be grateful for whatever your eating"", no matter how bad it is mindset got started.  I'm not sure we've recovered from it, most of the people I know will rave about restaurants I think are really average.

&gt;American cooks in OP's situation use sites like Cooking for Engineers and Budget Bytes, full of cost-effective, easy and simply-written recipes. But I've never come across any British equivalents. Do you know of any?

To be honest, like you, I dont care where the recipe comes from and most of the time I end up cooking recipes from American sites - because there is an abundance of American sites on the web.  I mostly use Youtube though.  If I fancy cooking something I usually look for it on Youtube and watch someone else make it first so I have an idea of how its done.

To play in central midfield can be a pretty scary job, considering that you are in the area of the pitch with most opposite players around you. Add to that that it is expected from a club of this standard to take control of the ball, turn around, and make a constructive pass. 

In Spain, where these kinds of CMs are most prevalent, the pressure in low mid to mid, are of a different calibre that in the PL . In the PL, your time on the ball is zero to none in most games. 

This is one thing that Allen excels at, and this is why he is seen as the Welsh Xavi. 
This guy turns around in the most crammed situations you can imagine, and thereby bypasses the most vital area of the game, like a hot knife through butter.

* there is a hotel straddling the railroad and income tax tiles. Only Levy would be clever enough to strike such a deal, a deal which many other mortals might find rule-breaking or illegal. Also, given that the railroad is a means of transportation, I can only conclude that this is a reference to the much-rumored trip to Germany to buy promising youths.
* There is only one game piece visible (it appears to be the thimble, and located next to the water works). Levy is so clever that he actually eliminated all other players. This is a subtle way of Levy saying ""I play this game, while everyone else just watches.""

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"&gt; Once again, I can only think to say [citation needed]. Maybe if we had a political system where consensus-building among more pluralistic political viewpoints was encouraged, but we don't. In practice, all this means is huge swathes of the electorate have their issues unrepresented.

Lets take for example Gay rights: Due to the softening of the Conservatives- Britain has become the leader in Europe over this issue, due to our push for equality, this wouldn't of happened if the Conservatives kept to their dogma and stayed away from the centre ground

One source: http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/Attachments/side_a_rainbow_europe_map_2015_a3_no_crops.pdf

&gt; The only advantage of student loans is that they help to satisfy neoliberal ideology by turning higher education more into a business (as it is in the US) and thus helping to depoliticise universities and students, politicised students being one of the groups the conservatives most detest, for whatever reason.

Its not about saving money, its a Conservative belief that only those who truly care about going to university should go to university. Not those who are either forced to go by their family or who don't really want to be there and other wise just drink for 3 years of their life. Its all about creating an elite. 

Lets look at Scotland, they don't have tuition fees, but their grants are absolutely shocking, so the poor actually find it harder to actually go to university, because they can't keep up with the cost.

Its not the tuition fees that hurt students, its the poor grant money. Which naturally would come about if we had free tuition.

&gt; Part of the reason that people are sceptical about immigration is because, again, no major party has the guts to fight the utter nonsense peddled by the right wing press

Look at the issue of Calais, that is a great indication of why people are sceptical of mass immigration, its not the right wing press just creating a narrative.

&gt; We know that, in the real world, immigration has almost no measurable effect on people's employment prospects, and studies commissioned by the last government have shown that, far from restricting immigration, we need to encourage it at higher levels in order to avoid a serious demographic timebomb from our aging population

Its not a ""Turk er jerbs"" argument that is now the most popular point against a lot of immigration, its what will happen to British culture, society etc. People look at places like Lewisham and not see Britain, but a place from like Africa or the Middle East. This isn't be being racist, buts its what I here a lot from the working class, this isn't a right wing media narrative, its what a lot of people think. 

I subscribe to the theory that the media only plays on what the view of the people is at the time, and since the most popular paper in the UK at this moment of time, is the [Mail](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/mail-uks-most-read-newspaper-brand-under-35s-favour-sun), which is a right wing leaning paper, this indicates that the most popular view at this moment of time is centre or right wing. This makes sense when translated in the general election of 2015, where 51% of all those who voted, voted for right wing parties: https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide

(Or 49.5% depending on your source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results)

This is something that some of the left have to wake up to, the Right Wing press is Right Wing, because their readers must be right wing, or centre-right. Not the other way round.

The media will destroy Labour in 2020, the Scottish Sun will back the SNP and the Sun will back the Conservatives. They will peddle anything Corbyn has said which is quite controversial like:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CagRMhkO-zE (Shit title and its from 2013 but its ammunition against Corbyn)

The people will not stand for any negotiations on the falklands, they want to be British, they are our people, and we must defend them from the Argentinians, who only want to use it for oil and nothing else.

- http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/07/13/jeremy-corbyns-hamas-gril_n_7788826.html

Saying that he was friends with Hamas and Hezbollah? Now that is going to go down so well with those who don't like Terrorism or Hamas for that matter. He lost his rag because he was called out on his bullshit.

He is the Right Wings wet dream, he is everything you want in a 'crazy leftie', its only a matter of time until the left realise that he isn't so popular outside the left wing clique.

They like to portray him as someone who will increase income taxes to 60-70% but no, just a meagre 50%. He does want to change council tax to have more bands so that may become more progressive. I wonder what he'll do with VAT &amp; other forms of taxation. He did say a wealth tax is a possibility, but again this isn't some crazy idea, many countries have wealth taxes. His main focus seems to be getting rid of tax avoidance, which I think many could get on board with. The anti avoidance programme Osborne is introducing (diverted profits tax) doesn't seem to be doing a whole lot.

Now, I am intrigued by this thought. You said it best in saying Lovren positions well, however I am scared that he won't have the pace or the fitness for the CDM role. Unfortunately with a 1 CDM system you almost need a box-to-box like player in that role. He wouldn't have the pace or the fitness to cover from sideline to sideline. Using him as a  lone CDM in our system would take away some freedom from Milner/Hendo/Allen. 

Now, if we ran a 2 CDM set, like a 4231, he might have some promise. That way he is more of a advanced CB. 

Lastly, I have to admit, I have been a critique of Lovren in the past, but passing is something I've actually always been impressed with. surprisingly he can pick a pass out better than most in our squad. Also, truthfully I got to give this guy some credit. Yes he had a shocker of a first half of the year, but when Sakho went down, and he had to fill in on an unfamiliar back 3, I don't think he got the credit he deserved. I was actually pretty impressed with his composure through some games (SOME NOT ALL).

There were plenty taxpaying citizens whose children had no chance of getting into one of the very few decent state schools in a local authority which was perennially stuck at the bottom of the league tables.

Also, while the religion may not have been forced upon us (aside from Mass about three times a year and a short prayer whenever we had assemblies), there were things that were missed out of our education thanks to the school's Catholic ethos. The most obvious one was sex and relationships education. All we got was a basic explanation of the biology and an awful talk from the spiteful Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. Very little on STDs, nothing on contraception or issues of consent and sexual ethics.

Religious Studies GCSE was compulsory, but we only learned about Catholicism and Catholic views on issues. I had a very good teacher who was careful to present things in an unbiased manner, but I was never taught about any other religions, except for a couple of token lessons on Judaism and Islam during the school's 'Multicultural Weeks' in Years 7 and 8.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"Neither (by that logic) do Hindu and Chinese and Jewish communities. The only reason you ""like them"" is because they are well educated and rich and don't break the law. 

I will point out that the only reason they are considered not to have integrated is the fact that they used to mainly work on the off shift in factories. 

No one else wanted to work at nights, Pakistanis were brought in SPECIFICALLY to keep mills, forges and factories functioning during nights. It's why their food shops opened late. When the factories closed they were fucked because 

1. they didn't need good education to work in the factories
2. People blamed them for the factories closing. Not the fact most of Asia was producing things for much cheaper
3. They faced rather horrible racism and still often do. 
4. People with poor educations tend to not encourage education in their kids. I mean if you can make a fair living on a GCSE only education, why would you invest time to go to A-Levels and then to Uni? Muslim kids from Pakistan followed in their father's foot steps and ended up woefully undergunned compared to say... Muslim Kids from India who mainly came in as upper middle class engineers, doctors and lawyers. SO they spoke urdu AND English. So their kids learnt English and proceeded to quickly shoot through the ranks of schools (howeve remember they are a minority compared to British Indian Hindus so Hindus are more associated with academic performance over Muslims). 

Basically? You must realise this. There are barriers to integration. 

From my personal experience. 

1. A young lady on a date asked me to bring my passport to ""prove I wasn't after her for a British Visa"". 

2. I have been beaten for being Asian

3. I got asked once ""why are you so interested in being a doctor"" by a teacher who didn't sound too impressed by the fact I scored pretty highly on class tests. I know. Bod. 

4. Being told to ""fuck off and not touch my daughter"" by a variety of charming fathers. It's okay. I get my own back these days. 

Every time you are burned like this it becomes harder to want to be a part of something. I used to be made fun of for my food. For the fact we celebrated Diwali. I once dressed in my traditional clothes and got made fun off. The same idiots who did that dress like me for their weddings today while me and my fiancee FEAR to dress in those. 

My parents have an indian palate so they never GOT British food. Everyone else had sandwiches. I had aubergines and peas in mine. I used to throw my food out after I left the house and steal money from my mum's purse to fit in. I once threw an incredible fit aged 12 in Rusholme (that Anand's Cash And Carry STILL remind me of today) because I didn't want to eat Indian food. 

Even the fact my fiancee is a Malaysian is often brought up by people as a sign I haven't integrated. 

Trust me. It's easy to say that we should ""integrate"" but a lot of the issues as to why we aren't integrated boil down to ""We alienated you a lot until you decided to just do you own thing, but now why won't you deal with us"". 

So I ask this. Define integration. What do you want minorities to do to integrate? ",null,1,null,1438011724,null,0,false,0,cthucte,null,t3_3er3z4,null,t1_cthucte,null,t1_cthoaf8,null,null,null,1440114515,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

Overall, we had some great attacks and good shots on goal. 2 goals a piece for Kolarov, Silva, and Sterling, with Sterling picking up an assist as well. Our youth talent looks great from this game against the power house of Vietnam. I'm looking forward to seeing how Sterling - Aguero - Silva looks this season, and how our team is going to operate with all starters in. Question I have:

1. Which of our youth talent gets promoted to the squad, who goes on loan? (Assuming current team, no transfers) I can see Denayer being on our top squad.
2. Sterling can score, but we haven't seen him work with Aguero. How will these two work together?

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"the ""interest"" part of the compound interest is in this case return on the investment.  your pension will be invested automatically in company shares, which will go up and down in value and pay dividends. the combination of price change and dividend receipts will be your return (and can be negative if the prices move down).  you will also have to pay (hopefully fairly small) fees to your pension provider for the work they do, which will reduce the returns made as well.

i wouldn't suggested worrying too much about this over short term periods. your investment horizon is 40 years, so changes week by week or month by month will smooth out over that period.

the important point is that compound interest is an interesting concept (though not guaranteed to be helpful to you).  if your returns average about 6% pa, and inflation is around 2%, then your  investments are growing *in a real sense* by 4% pa. the inflation bit is relevant because you're saving money to use in your retirement, when a shopping basket of food will cost more than it does today. trying to survive on Â£100 a week in 2050 will be a lot harder than it is now. the *real* return is a financial term to describe profits adjusted for inflation.

so in the above example simply having an investment makes you money, even after inflation. and in simple terms, the longer you have this investment, the longer it will make money (and the money you make in year 1 will go on to make money as well in year 2+, and so on). that is why saving early is considered good.

of course, the downside is that your investments do poorly and you make -2% (-4% after inflation). if that happens, you'll wish you'd left it in a bank account.  but the assumption is that even if this happens a few times over the 40 years, there will be good years to compensate and even it back out to a happier average.",null,0,null,1438012395,null,0,false,0,cthusky,null,t3_3erwwe,null,t1_cthusky,null,t3_3erwwe,null,null,null,1440114722,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

You think only rich people buy shares? Many middle class workers benefit from share schemes in the companies they work for. ""Private sector"" and ""free market"" shouldn't be confused as synonyms for wealthy individuals or corporate interests.  

Wherever there is public investment, the benefits will always be to an extent private because the aim is to filter through and benefit individuals as much as it is to benefit the public they make up as a whole. Who is ultimately benefiting under the faceless concept of the 'general public?' Presumably the actual individuals that constitute this broad, all-encompassing organisation.

Do you understand that the desire for change is not just Scotland? This is my point. By differentiating it as Scottish problems the SNP is essentially using social problems to reinforce nationalist ideas. 

They tell you that Scotland governing itself will improve the situation but the problem is that these social issues manifest in all democracy - they are not offering a sure fix for Scotlands issues just saying they could do it better which British politicians have said since the dawn of time.

50,000 bottles of sauvignon

26,000 bottles of merlot

8,000 bottles of champers

33,000 pints of guest ale

Over two years.

Let's do some quick figures:

730 days, 650 MP's, 84,000 bottles of wine = 0.1 bottles per day, per MP, or one bottle each every ten days.

33,000 pints of guest ale = 0.06 pints per MP per day, or one pint each per fortnight.

Now those numbers aren't perfect because parliament isn't open 365 days a year, and I assume not every MP drinks there, so it's safe to assume that some will drink heavily while others abstain completely.

I think the petitioner has a point - no other workplace encourages the intake of alcohol like Parliament does. 

Remember that the Chancellor is allowed alcohol at the dispatch box while delivering the Budget. Remember also how belligerent the Lords got when it was suggested they cut their booze budget.

I agree with the petitioner, to be honest. If we tackle the problem by just Closing the bar in the Parliament building, there's nothing stopping MP's going elsewhere.

8) **Watch Wrexham at the Racecourse** - I used to watch Wrexham weekly growing up.

11) **Swansea Market**

16) **St Fagans** love going here

17) **Tintern Abbey**

27) **See a show at the Millennium Centre** - saw Wozzeck here, a German language opera. Love the venue and the auditorium is excellent.

29) **Sample Welsh cheese** though I like Cardiff International Food Fest. I'll get to the Big Cheese one day, couldn't make it this year though.

32) **See the bluebells at Wenallt**

35) **Elan Valley** - went last year and it's lovely, with some great roads to run the car around on too. I will be back!

38) **Eat Cadwaladr's icecream at Criccieth** - my grandmother swears by it and we used to seek it out in Llandudno. Personally I think the icecream at Happy Valley pleasure gardens is better (but I can't remember who supplies it). Anyway go there and have the key lime cheesecake icecream because it's amazing.

40) **Visit the Big Pit**

51) **Llangollen International Eisteddfod**

59) **Fossil hunting on Glamorgan coast** - We went looking for ammonites with an archaologist friend of mine.

61) **Great Orme Tramway**

63) **Penderyn Distillery**

71) **Roman ruins in Caerleon**

74) **Slate heritage at Blaenau Ffestiniog** - not only that, there's some great driving roads in the area too. Love going up here when visiting mum and dad in North Wales.

76) **Walking the coastline** though for me there is plenty more to see

79) **St Asaph** - I don't think it's that great though.

80) **Go to the Maes at the National Eisteddfod.**

81) **Marvel at Newport's transporter bridge**

84) **Swallow Falls at Betws-y-coed**

87) **Fish and chips in the sun at Barry Island** and sunshine there was. Been plenty of times not in the sun too.

98) **Harlech Castle** - is pretty awesome and I love the views down to the coast.

100) **Powis Castle** - it really is very fine



**To-do list** (I want to do many of these things but these rank top):



9) **Wild swimming** although I think I'll be in the Brecons rather than Snowdonia

10) **Watch Wales at the Millennium Stadium** - I never seem to be able to get bloody tickets but I will one day.

55) **Take a barge over Poncysytlle** - I've walked it but never done it in a canal boat.

73) **Royal Welsh Show** - something I think all Welsh people should do at some point, I've just never been free on the week it's on.

89) **Pistyll Rhaeadr** - just looks beautiful.

**Is anything missing from the list?**

I'd add spending a day at Black Rock Sands near to Porthmadog, a huge expansive beach you can drive your car right on to, with some of the best views east back towards Snowdonia. Anyone else have any suggestions?

Really? How many? Owning a share of the company you work for is different anyway, under an actual socialist system workers would between them own the whole company, so it's actually a left wing concept.

&gt; Wherever there is public investment, the benefits will always be to an extent private because the aim is to filter through and benefit individuals as much as it is to benefit the public they make up as a whole. 

The key question is which individuals are benefiting from the current privatised system?

I nearly tied Chelsea's PL record of only conceding 15 goals in a season, but I conceded a late goal in the last game to finish with a +60, 76 goals scored, 16 conceded. This was my team:

GK: Courtois (86)

LB: Azpilicueta (83)

CB: Vertonghen (82)

CB: JT (C) (85)

RB: Ivanovic (82)

DM: Matic (85)

CM: Fabregas (86)

LM: Hazard (90)

AM: Oscar (84)

RM: Willian (83)

ST: Costa (85)

Bench:

GK: Begovic (81)

LB: Fabio Coentrao (80)

CB: Gary Cahill (80)

DM: Luis Gustavo (81)

CM: Radja Nainggolan (81) (I had Ramires for half the year, but then he asked to be sold since he wasn't getting enough time)

CM/AM: Joao Moutinho (83)

RM/LM: Juan Cuadrado (81)

ST: Loic Remy (80)

Somehow, I got everyone on my bench to accept Squad Rotation Player roles except for Moutinho, who I used in place of Oscar in some tough away games where I just want to keep holding possession. 

Also, what was weird (but kinda cool) is the CPU would sub Cahill for Azpi (even though Coentrao is on the bench), and roll with the all CB back line of Vertonghen, Terry, Cahill, Ivanovic. Thankfully, I'd usually be winning when they made that substitution and so usually couldn't get exposed from the lack of pace, but it did strike me as being the ultimate way to park the bus.

null,false,HLB217,lfc68,,null,"Great write up from a statistical point of view. I'm going to have to disagree with Lovren at CDM though for a myriad of reasons.

**1) Passing** - Passing as a Center Back is completely different to passing as a midfielder. As a Center Back your passing is generally to an unmarked player, both the passer and receiver are under less pressure, resulting in more time to control and make a decision. Yes statistically Lovren has a greater passing distance on average, but the nature of the pass is different. There's also the pass frequency. As a defensive midfielder you WILL need to create and use space. This will mean movement and quick 1-2s with other players, along with passes back and split second decision making. None of which I have confidence in Lovren's ability to do. Which brings me to my next point. 


**2) Decision Making** - Lovren's decision making and mental game is hilariously weak. We've lambasted his inability to make the right call all season, from marking, to failure to challenge, to poor choices in a tackle and shooting. I'll use a recent example that's probably been picked to death - the first goal conceded against the Malaysia XI. The ball was played beyond Skrtel (who was also out of position, this part is not on Lovren), but was there to be won by the covering player. Lovren did not challenge in any meaningful way, allowing the Malaysian player to continue the play forward. Lovren proceeded to misjudge the movement of the player on the ball, allowing him to get the shot off, resulting in a goal. This is one of many examples of poor decision making. As a midfield player, your mental game must be very strong. Lovren has time and time again shown he cannot read the play in a way that would let him be a defensive mid. We'll see him caught out a lot more, which will now feed into my next argument.


**3) Physicality** - Most defensive midfielders are tactically astute. Now I have pointed out that Lovren doesn't show signs of tactical flexibility. Some defensive midfielders don't, and as a result must rely on other abilities to cover for this deficiency. Speed and strength come into play here. This one works for Lovren because he is no slouch, and is quite strong. Granted his strength has been suspect at times (Bolaise, Benteke spring to mind), but he is strong. His speed is good for a Center Back, but can you expect him to keep up with the players that he will need to compete with in midfield? I have my doubts, personally.


**4) Interceptions, Tackling, and Movement** - I feel that I can cover both in one spot. As a Center Back tackling and interceptions become less frequent as the game is played more often than not in midfield, but each interception and tackle is worth more to the team. This is why midfielders typically foul more and pick up more cards. Lovren's tackling is strong and resolute, and for some reason I can't remember a single interception he's made. His movement is what would cause the biggest issue among these 3. He's a big boy, and his movement reflects that. I would be skeptical of his ability to play a DM in Rodgers' system simply because his mobility is so constrained by his size. 

**5) Aerial Ability** - While it's nice to have a strong header on you, some of the very best defensive midfielders are somewhat weak in the air. Mascherano, Lahm, Lucas, Essien, Gattuso, et al, granted may not be strict defensive midfield players, but their strengths were not in an aerial challenge. You'll see that when we get a high ball against us, one of the Center Backs will step up to challenge, normally Skrtel, allowing the defensive mid to cover his position once the ball hits the deck.

It's a lot to read, hopefully it doesn't come across as a rambling mess.

TL;DR - Don't play Lovren in DM.",null,0,null,1438013733,null,0,false,0,cthvohk,null,t3_3es0mu,null,t1_cthvohk,null,t3_3es0mu,null,null,null,1440115206,null,27,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,27,null

Privatization of the postal industry in Europe has been a complete shambles. In the Netherlands you have sporadic deliveries at random days of the week by posties on less than minimum wage. They actually have the post dropped off to their own houses, where they sort the mail on their dinner tables/beds/floor, if you can believe that. They can be sacked at a moment's notice, and receive no sick pay or holiday. Does that sound good to you?

The only company to compete with Royal Mail at end-to-end delivery (actually having postal workers delivering mail) in the UK was Whistl. They had staff on low wages, zero-hours contracts, delivering up to late in the evening and on random days of the week (i.e. when it's profitable - save today's mail until tomorrow and then you can get 2 days worth of work done for the price of one), and only in certain areas of certain cities (i.e. the lucrative areas). Earlier in the year they suspended their entire delivery service at short notice due to investors pulling out, resulting in thousands of staff being made redundant overnight. The service has remained suspended and is unlikely to resume anytime soon.

What's been happening for years is private postal operators (the likes of TNT, UKMail, etc), have been snapping up contracts to collect and sort mail from businesses, and then simply dropping the mail off at an RM mail centre for distribution and delivery, as Royal Mail is obliged to fulfill the USO (universal service obligation) of 6 day delivery to all addresses. This left Royal Mail to do the dirty work at a reduced rate, and kick-started a race-to-the-bottom scenario for employee pay which continues to this day.

Prior to the postal market being opened up to competition, Royal Mail actually made huge profits, and its workers enjoyed a job which was respected. Those profits should have been reinvested back into the service, but of course in order to justify the privatisation of an established and successful public service, it had to be crippled first, and crippled it eventually was, deliberately and ruthlessly.

It's a complex issue of which many articles have been written

and blogs
(https://roymayall.wordpress.com/)

but essentially it boils down to the postal industry working best for the public and its workers as a natural monopoly. Compare the two scenarios

Scenario One:
Penny Black Walk is a road with 700 addresses on it. The post for Penny Black Walk's 700 addresses is delivered by 5 different posties. Some of them deliver on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Some of them deliver on tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays. Others deliver whenever it suits them. It is difficult to keep track of who delivers when because they may change at any time. A resident on Penny Black Walk may get a signed for letter at 9am from one postie, and then an international registered letter at 5pm from another. Each postie earns on average about Â£6.50 per hour, and is usually tired and stressed doing a job which requires long hours yet has no perks and doesn't feel rewarding. Each postie usually has to deliver to several other streets along with Penny Black Walk. This is because the total volume of post is divided by 5, therefore each postie must cover more ground to be more profitable. The 5 different posties also drive 5 different vans, which means more traffic and more pollution for the residents of Penny Black Walk. When those residents want to go and pick up an item which has been returned to the sorting office, there are 5 different offices in remote industrial areas on the outskirts of town that they have to travel to, and are usually difficult to access by public transport. The posties on Penny Black Walk often make mistakes and deliver post to the wrong house because they do not know the area well. This is because the companies they work for have a high turnover of staff, so a postie one week may be completely different from a postie the next week. If the residents of Penny Black Walk want to send a letter to a village in the countryside, or somewhere that is considered 'remote', it costs the customer a lot more because it is less profitable for the 5 competing companies to deliver to these areas. It is therefore more likely to take longer to be delivered as a result.

Scenario Two
Penny Black Walk is a road with 700 addresses on it. The post for Penny Black Walk's 700 addresses is delivered by 1 postie who is the regular that works 5 days a week, and a 'reserve' who also works 5 days a week but covers other posties on their days off. This means post on Penny Black Walk gets delivered 6 days a week, with 1 day each week delivered by the reserve. The posties earn on average about Â£13.00 an hour, and enjoy the benefits that come with full-time employment such as annual leave and sick pay. They are incentivised to stay with the company by a seniority scheme, which means the more years they work, the more annual leave they can take. This is good because being a postie is tiring on the body, and older posties need more time off work to recover from the strains of the job. The postie on Penny Black Walk doesn't need to deliver to any other streets though, because he is delivering ALL of the day's mail for the entire street, so amazingly his work is still very profitable, even despite receiving a proper wage with full-time perks! He usually doesn't require a van, because the sorting office is located nearby in the centre of town. That means the postie can easily walk from the sorting office to Penny Black Walk without clogging up the roads, and residents can easily pick up their items on the way back from work. Because they are paid well and enjoy the seniority scheme which rewards them for long service, the posties have been delivering in the area for a long time, so the postie on Penny Black Walk knows their customers like the back of their hand. This means they rarely make mistakes, and if a letter or parcel arrives which doesn't have the correct post-code or doesn't have a house number on it, they can usually figure out who it is for. If the residents of Penny Black Walk want to send a letter , they can enjoy a fixed rate to any location in the country, and know that it  should be received the very next day regardless of how far it has to travel.",null,0,null,1438014051,null,0,false,0,cthvw3n,null,t3_3eplfv,null,t1_cthvw3n,null,t1_cthn3wo,null,null,null,1440115304,null,6,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

The tories set the narrative that labour ruined the economy (I kept seeing the widespread notion that this was somehow due to ""running up the national credit card"" on social programs) and Labour didn't do enough  to contest that.

Labours position was that they would go along with cuts, but not as hard. This is terrible since it concedes the central message to the tories (that austerity is necessary and good).

The fact that he also came out with lefty ideas about mansion taxes and rent controls and MORE public spending just sounds contradictory and incoherent in that light, not like bold vision. It plays into the worst stereotypes of left wing governments- don't know what the hell they're doing with the economy. 

Its unlikely simply ""being more right wing"" would have saved him though, because it was on top of the fact that Ed as a personality didn't exactly project competence. In the end with fears about the economy as paramount, people voted for the devil they knew, the Tories.

Corbyns argument is more coherent, since his position rejects the necessity of austerity outright.

Cars last a long time and you generally get many years of driving them after you have paid them off. Leasing is a monthly expense with no return. Buying, sure the car depreciates in value, but

For example, my last car I drove for 9 years and I got it used, the car was originally made in 1995. Now if I was leasing cars I would have been paying leasing costs every single months for all 9 of those years. Instead, since I bought the car, I was able to go for years with no monthly costs associated with the car at all.

Also remember that just because a car is used doesn't mean it is old or unreliable. The are plenty of used cars from the last 2 years that don't have that much driving on them and are still quite new and very reliable. These will be cheaper then brand new cars.

Suppose someone campaigning to get marijuana legalised was voted in as an MP and then was prevented from voting because theyâd been smoking it. I wouldnât consider that right (as thereâd be no hypocrisy on their part).

Does this mean that drug addicts/alcoholics wonât be allowed to vote? That would have prevented Charles Kennedy from doing so on more than one occasion (as well as many others); but it doesnât mean he was a poor politician.

Is someone that has had one glass of beer (or wine or gin or whatever) realistically going to be in a worse state than, say, someone thatâs just been travelling for several hours (from a far off constituency) and is sleep deprived?

Imagine if someone (such as a member of the Monster Raving Loony Party) was voted in on the promise that theyâd get really drunk and then decide how to vote by flipping a coin as they go into the chamber. What would happen then?

null,false,PhillyScouser,null,null,null,"Great analysis here and I appreciate the sentiment. I too wish there were a cure to Lovren's ills. As an analytics guy myself, I see where your coming from, but CB and CDM are two very different positions. 

A CB always has the game in front of him(unless he's not doing his job), and will be able to judge the amount of time he has to make his pass because he can see all of the opposing players. If he's getting pressed he can go back to the keeper, if he has time he can play a ball forward or switch sides. 

A CDM has the game in front of him for a majority of the time, but the way a CDM plays with his back to the opponents goal is crucial. This requires good positional awareness of teammates and opponents alike. It also requires a good first touch and knowledge of how spaces will open up for himself and others when the ball is coming to him. He is the link between the back line and the midfield. This is why a CM with a defensive skillset can easily translate their game to a CDM. They're used to playing themselves and others into space. 

While I think Lovren potentially has the skill set, I think it would be too much to ask for him to learn an entirely new position, one that requires a lot of thought and a good first touch.

However we do need him to be able to fill in when a regular starter is injured or needs a break. While many of you don't rate him at this, he does it well and without complaint. He is the best presser that we have and wins us the ball. He is also very tidy, he rarely looses us possession. He does pass sideways frequently but his position often dictates that, needing to recycle possession for us and begin moves from the back. You cannot pass it forward every time, it isn't fifa. He has good close control, like the game where he kept the ball from a couple city players in the box. And frankly that's enough for me to rate him for what he does for us. A squad player with excellent pressing, and decent passing, dribbling, and defense. Don't forget how we were calling him the welsh xavi for a few weeks after the city game. I'd say that he genuinely plays like a not as good Xavi. 
But there are reasons he doesn't start. He's not an aerial threat. While he can press and defend, if he lets himself get caught with the ball it's a risk if he gets  into a physical duel. And lastly he won't go above a 6 point season (goals + assists). He gets the job done well in the midfield but in the final third he's not the man to deliver the final effort. That last one is the biggest for BR imo, he really expects some final product from players, that's why I imagine he doesn't seem to favor Lucas. Allens biggest advantage in all of this is his pressing, that's a very important skill to BR and why I think he wanted him so badly from Swansea.

It's debatable whether a share is a left wing thing though since they're more of a quasi property/contractual bundle of rights and not exactly akin to outright ownership in the old-school Marxist (or even capitalist) sense. 

At any rate corporate governance has shifted dramatically and new business models are emerging. On top of this, there is nothing preventing cooperatives existing and indeed thriving in the current environment. They're just not the dominant model because they aren't as effective or beneficial to most stakeholders. 

By value 70% of what individuals own is in the FTSE 100's equity (ONS figures). Depends how and what you're counting though (e.g. think of all the small private companies: each director is a shareholder). Think about corporate pensions schemes as well (dreadful, I know). 

It's amusing that you're so sceptical -- the whole point of public limited companies is so that they can raise money from the public rather than private equity firms, banks and angel investors (the key is in the name). 

A tiny minority will always benefit regardless of the system, this is the reality the left thinks it can somehow eradicate through designing perfect institutions. It's just not realistic. Under a leftist agenda you just veer in the direction of public officials benefiting more either by giving them more power or otherwise. 

National debts and household debts aren't identical but that doesn't mean the same principles don't underline them both. It's not a complete lie to equate the two, it's just a half-truth on par with pretending they are *that* radically different in nature.

Just very quickly, the original piece on Sky News that is cited as source says:

I mean what that actually says is: 

&gt; *""socialising with outsiders""* **some context that might be really fucking important** *""will be expelled if there is no improvement after cautioning.""*

There's a bunch of stuff in there that makes it sound like a shitty school but, at the same time, without seeing the actual documents that Sky claim to have seen I sort of don't believe it because Sky news is a cesspit of journalistic decrepitude.

As for Labour losing the election, maybe they will, however I'd be a little bit less arrogant if I were a Tory since it helps them more to have a Labour party that supports their economic agenda, and helps normalise their extreme attacks on the poor, the young, the disabled and other vulnerable people, whereas with Corbyn (as we saw with the SNP) might fundamentally shift the terms of the debate onto terrain the Tories are much less comfortable with.

Basically, Everton played at Anfield up until 1892, when the team and stadium ownership split over an increase in rent. Anfield's owner created LFC that summer, and needed to field a team quickly. LFC's first manager, John McKenna, focused primarily on Scotland for talent.   
&gt; His rapid elevation to the top of English football is proof of John McKenna's abilities as a manager and administrator. With a generous loan from Houlding of Â£500 that was never paid back, and McKenna's know how, over a dozen players were recruited from Scotland. This led to LFC becoming known as the ""Team of all the Macs"" because of their surnames. However amongst the Scottish ""Macs"" in the early formations the goalkeeper Bill McOwen was in fact an Englishman.

Online dating has changed this a bit, because generally the first date isn't a date so much as a meetup, personally I'd consider a second online date to be about the same as a first date in real life.

First one by Richard Seymour, a marxist:

http://www.leninology.co.uk/2015/07/project-fear-versus-corbyn.html

&gt;So, let's be clear.  The candidate the Conservatives are most frightened of is Jeremy Corbyn.  They know this isn't 1981, and they know that he isn't an erratic egomaniac.  They know that in an unstable ideological climate in which the dominant parties have an increasingly shaky relationship with their traditional base, unexpected things can happen.  It is precisely the opposite of what Blair claimed: there is no guarantee of any ""traditional result"".  They have no idea what the result would be if Corbyn actually won; because they had no idea that Corbyn even stood a chance.

Then this from liberal keynesian economics professor Simon Wren-Lewis: http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/when-labour-lost-its-soul-and-next.html

&gt; If you want to see the tragedy of what is currently happening to Labour, you just need to look at the Welfare Bill that was debated in parliament yesterday. This bill

&gt;â     repeals most of the Child Poverty Act, and in particular abandons poverty reduction targets

&gt;â     tightens the âbenefits capâ, the total amount a family can receive in benefits

&gt;â     extends the freeze on working age benefits for the next four years

&gt;â     limits child tax credits (subsidies for the low paid) to the first two children

&gt;Although Labour tabled amendments to this bill, after those were inevitably defeated it abstained rather than voting against. Of the four leadership candidates, only Corbyn defied this party line.

&gt;Labour did not vote against this bill despite the inevitable result that it will increase child poverty. Indeed, an apt title for this bill would be the âIncreasing Child Povertyâ bill. One of the great achievements of the last Labour government was to reduce child poverty, largely through the system of tax credits, and todayâs Labour party has abstained on a bill that will set about dismantling and reversing that.

&gt;This electoral strategy of moving the party to the right by abandoning its core values seems doomed to failure. Unless the plan is to outdo the Conservatives in dismantling the welfare state, Labour will always be seen as âsoft on welfareâ by the electorate. Even if they voted with the government on every single deficit reduction measure, the Conservatives will still argue that Labourâs claims to be competent at running the economy are not credible, and use the unchallenged assertion that Labour caused austerity as evidence. In addition, following the Conservatives to the right is potentially suicidal because it takes for granted that those on the left will continue to vote for them.

For every vote that Labour could win from the Tories by moving to the centre they will lose 2 of their traditional base to UKIP, Green, SNP, Plaid, maybe even the Lib Dems if they move to the left. The logic of New Labour, where working-class Labour voters would be expected to carry on voting Labour because *there's nowhere else to go* (to quote Peter Hain) doesn't hold true today. Labour lost more seats to the ""others"" than they did to the Tories, and whatever they can gain from moving to the centre is futile unless they win back those lost seats they can't form a government.",null,0,null,1438019793,null,0,1438020115,0,cthzuy0,null,t3_3eryzk,null,t1_cthzuy0,null,t3_3eryzk,null,null,null,1440117174,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

Instead, he ""holds"" his defensive position, sits back close to the defence, and offers cover to the more mobile box-to-box and attacking midfielders.

Defensive midfielder can refer to one of two things. The first is a colloquial term among fans and analysts for a midfielder whose skill set is primarily defensive and doesn't offer much on the ball. The second refers to a midfielder who positions himself behind the other midfielders in the defensive phase of play. You normally see this in a three man midfield or diamond formation where one player remains between the defence and midfield to offer cover and allow the midfielders ahead of him to press more freely. This also reduces the need for the central defenders to step out of the defensive line if a pass is played behind the midfield.

By extension, a defensive midfielder can be and usually is a holding midfielder, though a holding midfielder is not necessarily a defensive midfielder in the second sense. In a 4231, for example, you typically have either two holding midfielders or two midfielders who alternate holding responsibilities in the attacking phase of play, but in the defensive phase, you'll usually see them in a midfield four without a DM behind them.",null,0,null,1438019881,null,0,1438020246,0,cthzx4c,null,t3_3eqrac,null,t1_cthzx4c,null,t3_3eqrac,null,null,null,1440117204,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

In one conversation with a platonic American friend of the opposite sex I could swear she was trying to get the answers to my internet bank security questions. To her it was just getting to know each other.

We are not effusive as Americans in general. If we say something was okay it was pretty good. If we say something was good, it was probably truly amazing.

We are also don't really do the whole dating terminology (at least I don't). We're not likely to ask you on a date. We'll just ask you if you fancy a drink sometime. If that goes well we'll ask again...and repeat. Things will progress naturally if they are destined too.

IMP is important. Thatâs my own acronym, which Iâm sure is not very original, which means Infrastructure Money and People. At present, the Blairites only have M. They donât have I and P.

Infrastructure is the party itself. Itâs the CLPs out there. The workers associations. The clubs and the affiliates. Itâs the Co-op party and the Minersâ pubs. They belong to the Labour party, and would have to reform and be attached to a new party. The Blairites will have to build their own infrastructure from scratch.

Money is the union donations, the private donations, the membership fees, and the state party funding. A Blairite party could count on the money which follows a defecting MP, and I suppose it would have some or most of the private donors. The union donations stays put, and the membership fees remain, and whatever is in the bank accounts and reserves will be Corbynâs to disperse. 

People are the members, the activists, the volunteers, and the canvassers who turn out in thick and thin to deliver leaflets and booklets. It is the ones who man the phone banks, and disturb you in the middle of dinner, begging to know who youâre going to vote for in an election. What motivates people will be key to where they go. These are the ones who John McTernan referred to as âsuicidal activist moronsâ, either that or the SpAdocracy. The SpAdocracy must be the only ones who are inspired by Burnham and Cooper, and mainly because they are looking out for number one, themselves.

Lacking Infrastructure and people, the Blairite party would have to start afresh without an activist base and without access to the CLPs and the affiliates. It would take time for the party to build that up. And to build that up, it would need activists who are engaged and passionate and believes in what theyâre doing. The whole ethos of the Blairite prospect is âpower before principle, and spin before substanceâ. That doesnât seem to be much of a basis to build a new party on.

Gridlock occurs currently because there's no actual 'agreement' between the parties at the moment on what to do in Government.

Gridlock (largely, but of course not completely) avoided.

What we have at the moment is almost guaranteed to produce gridlock however.

I am, actually. It's what I do for a living. The point I'm making is that yes, there will be bugs, almost guaranteed (in fact I often talk on this subreddit about the perils behind [giant government citizen data storage programs](http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/tsd/care-data/)), but the numbers of errors in decision-making that a machine would make (due to programming error) would be miniscule compared to what we're getting right now with real-life soldiers. One could argue that with a heavily armoured robot hitting an error that the consequences would be worse than if a lone soldier with a rifle went on a rampage, and you may be right, but it would be a case of offsetting this against the diminished likelihood of a mistake being made in the first place.

As well as this, the fact is that battles in modern times aren't fought on the ground. Frequently it starts with air bombardments dropping numerous shipments of bombs (that kill indiscriminately and turn buildings to rubble) before any boots on the ground are risked with moving in. Robots would be able to do the same but capture ground with minimal collateral and damage to the terrain (unless instead of the air force, the robots themselves are dropping the bombs).",null,0,null,1438022506,null,0,1438022733,0,cti1qr7,null,t3_3erdgp,null,t1_cti1qr7,null,t1_cthyr05,null,null,null,1440118062,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I am somewhat skeptical of the role model argument though. Yes, the Doctor is demonstrably an exception from the standard male action hero idea, but he is not unique in that regard. Any sort of iteration of Sherlock Holmes usually fits the brains over brawn requirement, and when you look beyond action movies you tend to find a fair bit more variation in male characters. Equally, if we're sticking to *Doctor Who*, you can just as easily give the female Doctor a male companion, who can act as an atypical role model.

No. Do not say this. Because you were making a halfway intelligent point up until this line. Don't try and discredit an idea by suggesting it's only for a few people, or by casting aspersions on the people who suggest it. Don't name a website and use it derisively, as if an idea is somehow lesser, based on who suggests it.

Because it is ***not*** ""current tumblr outcry"". That's nonsense. People have been suggesting and endorsing and encouraging and indeed calling for a female Doctor for a long time; Sylvester McCoy is, to be honest, in the minority.

As for my response to that. I think that the power of The Doctor lies in his reinterpretation, but I think that genderswapping is a step too far because of my previous role model argument. While I agree that there are exceptions to the brawny muscle hero type, there is none more so than The Doctor which has a lot to do with the fact that the casting of the character doesn't seem to be restricted to how attractive they are (Tennant is an exception with him being conventionally attractive). 

Even Sherlock Holmes has fallen to the 'Hollywood filter' with his movie incarnation being played by Robert Downey Jr and TV by Cumberbatch (which while not conventionally attractive facially has a body that makes most men jealous). 

The power of the character is in his ability to lead, there are very few male role models that lead without a machine gun or pistol in their hands (hell even Sherlock Holmes falls into that category occasionally) and I think taking one as iconic as The Doctor away would do more harm than good, although the thought of it making the next generation more accepting of transgender individuals is comforting the companion does not lead the show, The Doctor does. 

While the words were... Crass it is undeniable that the primary source of the vocal minority asking for this change is on tumblr, other social media sites are not nearly as... Encouraging of the idea. While the idea is not new (It has been around since the late 1970s I believe when Tom Baker threw it out during a convention talk) the current resurgence and backing of the idea is in a large part due to that vocality on tumblr. I'm not using it as a dismissal.

Basically a study that backs up what infected says to a point. Although cannabis may cause an impairment it is in no way comparable to alcohol with the user normally being able to compensate and drive slower. 

http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/02/why-medical-marijuana-laws-reduce-traffic-deaths/

A study has found a reduction in road deaths in states that have legalised medical cannabis.

I don't personally agree with driving while impaired but depends how you judge impaired.

At the group interview you'll probably have to fill some questionaire as to why you want to work with them. Then you will get a little presentation about Apple and asked how you feel. When I did it I was asked to tell something that was unique about me. And it was done in a group.

After that, you'll get paired with someone and given an scenario involving Apple products. Then, you'll probably given another chat as a group.

If you want to work with Apple, be yourself and be confident about questions asked and how people react. Have a look at the Apple [steps of service](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/apples-customer-service-secrets-revealed-apple).

If you're shortlisted after that, you'll get an interview with a manager and, if they like you, another with the store leader.

Contrastingly, in Scotland the game was played with greater emphasis on teamwork, with players moving into space to receive the ball from teammates, generally with the team playing as a more cohesive unit. 

 So it may well have been the case that English players were technically better in some departments, while Scottish players were technically better in others.

I think this season will see Everton start off badly and eventually picking up the form after the initial difficult run of game before fading at the end of the season. The initial run would be a very good measuring stick for Everton against the fellow European football chasers. Our current center backs are Jagielka and Stones. Our backups (Galloway and Browining) have a combined total of 2 premier league game experience. Unless we get someone in before the deadline (Van Dijk please!!!), we will be severely exposed if one of our starters go down. Our lack of firepower upfront would force Martinez to finally realize Kone is not Everton quality and pick up someone in January to compliment/push Lukaku. The added firepower would be crucial for our run-in and we finish in Europa places.


**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

John Stones will be our star of the season after this ridiculous saga. He would be closely watched by everyone and they would finally realize what a great young player he is. Also with the lack of real challenge at CB, I see Stonesy playing in most if not all of the games.


**How do you think the team will line up?**

4-2-3-1

Howard

Coleman Stones Jagielka Baines

McCarthy Barry

Mirallas Barkley Cleverly

Lukaku

The poor drink more as a proportion of their income, they smoke more too. The poor use drugs to make up for their lack of wealth or prosperity and invariably turn to the bottle or the fag when times are tough.

Those on modest to high incomes do drugs too, no-one is arguing that. But they have more of a safety net and their use is recreational rather than through boredom, lack of opportunities or addiction.

I used to know a guy who had to toke every 30 minutes. He literally couldn't do anything without it revolving around smoking weed. It became very difficult to be his friend because I genuinely couldn't go anywhere with him without him needing to smoke. I fear that legalising weed will just encourage more to try and more to become dependent.

They say that weed is not addictive; well tell that to my friend who just can't go an hour without blazing up.

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"Not *so* desperate.  We weren't quite as good without him, but to be honest, the biggest issue was probably that we had been rounding into form nicely since mid-December, culminating in New Year's Day against Chelsea, and just at that moment, we lost both Bentaleb *and* Mason.  Still, while Nabil was away, we went 4-2-1 in all competitions, including outrght demolitions of Burnley and West Brom.

* Prem League: 2-0-1
* FA Cup: 1-1-1
* League Cup: 1-1-0

Everyone around here was freaking out because we were going to be without both Bentaleb and Mason for a while, and losing to Palace right after smashing Chelsea made it seem like we were in trouble.  Falling behind 0-2 in the first half against Burnley seemed to confirm this, but then we roared back with four unanswered goals (""2-2 Capoue!"") to win that matchnhandily.  We then dominated Sunderland, though we struggled a bit to score -- we scored two but should have scored more.

Then Mason came back, but we still looked toothless for the first half of the home leg against Sheffield, eventually winning late after some key substitutions.  We absolutely sucked against Leicester (and Mason did not play, being saved for the away leg against Sheffield), and that loss looms large, as it knocked us out of the FA Cup.  But then we ""won"" a cracking away draw at Sheffield, and followed it by crushing West Brom at the Hawthorns.

Bentaleb came back just in time for the North London Derby, and we all know how that went.

So, overall, we did OK without Nabil, we were just our usual inconsistent selves.  It felt worse because because a) his last match before he left was the 5-3 Chelsea and his first match back was the 2-0 Woolwich, so of course the period of his absence felt like a dropoff, and b) half of that time were also missing Mason, although even without Ryan we got some good results.

**TL;DR:** We were actually OK without Bentaleb.  Not as good as we could have been, of course.  One wonders how we might have built on the win against Chelsea if we'd hadn't lost our entire starting central midfield coming out of that match.",null,0,null,1438026881,null,0,false,0,cti4rnx,null,t3_3erl6u,null,t1_cti4rnx,null,t1_cthpvz2,null,null,null,1440119553,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

All the power is already in the House of Commons, the House of Lords simply exists as a form of institutional corruption and patronage. It has no worthwhile purpose.

And this is simply an argument for broadening out power away from the House of Commons, which would mean an elected 2nd chamber at the very least, as well as stronger constitutional protections against the power of the executive.

And indeed the same to you! I have had more than a few discussions of this type go awry when people get a little... angsty.

To be honest though, I feel like we may be about to reach a standstill here. It's a case of a simple disagreement, I guess - I think that changing the Doctor wouldn't, actually, do more harm that good. I think that the benefits that come with a female Doctor (increased diversity, the potential for new stories, and indeed simply the fact it's a change) outweigh the potential detriments of losing the male role model - which you are right to point out, but I don't think it would be that much of a problem? I mean, people would still remember the previous Doctors, and the Doctor wouldn't then be a woman forever - roughly three years at first, and then presumably a variety of male and female actors taking the part from then on. You've still got the impact of previous Doctors (which does lessen, yes, when that male Doctor isn't around. Another counter I thought of, alongside Sherlock, were several *Star Trek* characters; though given the ones I had in mind aren't on television anymore, they don't exactly have the same impact they used to) and also that of companions, supporting characters, etc.

A slight improvement on last year but I still don't think we'll get anywhere near our 2013/14 performance. Although definitely a major factor, I think people overestimate the influence the Europa league had on our poor form last year. As ever, lack of depth is a problem for us. It only takes one or two injuries and we'll be relying on players like Kone, Hibbert, Robles, McGeady for our starting XI (far from ideal). Our lack of depth particularly hindered us after the world cup last year. Hope to see less favouritism from Bobby this year (so less Barry/Barkley/Howard if they're doing shite), and usually 2 wingers on the pitch at once. Need to sort defensive issues (particularly set pieces or it will cost us points). 

7th or 8th place finish I'd guess, maybe a long cup run but I'm not going to hold my breath. A difficult start could leave us worried around December.

Hard to guess the star player - probably someone like McCarthy or Jags again.

Why can't the people consent to a house which is appointed by an independent body rather than elected? Just because it isn't elected doesn't mean the people can't approve of it.

&gt;What are the ""flaws"" of democracy by the way?

- Voters who aren't educated in the nuances of subjects enough to make a good decision 
about them (see also: our broken drug laws).

- Voters who are interested in what is good for themselves rather than what is good for the country in general.

- Tyranny of the majority means that smaller views can often get overlooked.

- Democratically elected politicians often will do what makes them look good to guarantee re-election rather than what is good for the country.

Etc etc.

&gt;Since the Lords are appointed by the Prime Minister via pure patronage the idea that acts as any kind of balance is a joke. It's nothing more than a way to hand out favours to party donors and grandees to keep them on the gravy train in their retirement, it has no useful political function at all.

I do agree that the system for appointing people to the lords is fucked up but in my opinion it should be reformed rather than being abolished entirely. Having a house where people can assess a bill on its merit rather than whether it ticks political boxes is an important thing.

The fact that the two clubs were rarely in the same division didn't seem to stop them.

Sticking to football the reason the dislike can be one of the nastier ones is that the two clubs rarely play each other. Where as say Arsenal and Tottenham play each other every season Portsmouth and Southampton can go years without playing each other. This means that the fans get more ah hyped and the troublemakers take longer for the police to identify (supposedly there was one game where police were seeing faces they hadn't encountered in a decade). It doesn't help that Portsmouth were one of the last clubs to clear out their more violent element. 

Economically the two cities contrast pretty heavily. Portsmouth is in many ways a northern industrial city transplanted to the south cost. The decline of the local industry (the dockyard) hasn't been kind to it. Southampton has done slightly better while apparently attempting to create the most generic city on earth.

I will point out the rivalry isn't that serious. People will move between the cities for work and there's a fair bit of movement for shopping and tourism.

Harry Arter is always one to watch out for as a key player in midfield, and although he is notorious for his rash challenges and high level of bookings, he has majorly improved thanks to loan spells and maturity. He is also a goal scoring threat
  
Link up play between Ritchie and Simon Francis was also a style that worked very well in recent seasons.  
Callum Wilson's pace is one of his leading traits, working well with Yann Kermorgants acrobatics and unorthodox skill.  

Andrew Surman was very much an unsung hero last season, and worked well in a midfield position to keep our fluidity and offensive style.  

Marc Pugh is very skillful on the wing and links up well with LB Charlie Daniels, but are the weaker of the two wing pairings (over Ritchie and Francis)  

Steve Cook is a reliable left back, but also finds himself scoring when he decides to adventure up to the box during corners. With Tommy Elphick they almost always make up the two CB positions. Last season they played well, but in some instances looked rather shakey. Elphick is also a good leader for the team and a fan favourite.  

2 players that wouldn't usually start but bring new energy to the game later on as subs were Adam Smith and Eunan O'Kane. Smith, towards the latter part of the season became a game changing player when brought on mid way through the 90'  

Other than that, read up on the history and don't forget the staff behind the scenes. Jason Tindall's loyalty to Howe, and Steve Fletcher's loyalty to the club and his continued support on and off the pitch.

&gt;Voters who aren't educated in the nuances of subjects enough to make a good decision about them (see also: our broken drug laws).

I don't care those people have every right to participate in elections. If the people make ""bad"" decisions then that's their perogative. No-one should be ruled over by those who have no means of being held to account.

This is an argument for better ""education"" not an argument to get rid of democracy. The notion that ""the people are too stupid to be allowed to vote"" is about as reactionary as it gets.

&gt;Voters who are interested in what is good for themselves rather than what is good for the country in general.

What's wrong with this? How are the interests of the voters (ie people who live in the country) and the country different? What is ""the country"" if not the people who live there? Could you provide a specific example?

&gt;Tyranny of the majority means that smaller views can often get overlooked.

Which is a good argument for a constitution that mitigates the ability of a government to ignore opposition, not an argument for getting rid of the right to vote.

&gt;Democratically elected politicians often will do what makes them look good to guarantee re-election rather than what is good for the country.

Again you're setting up ""what's good for the country"" and ""what's good for the population who live in the country"" as two seperate things. The ""country"" is an abstract notion - if the words ""the country"" means anything it means the wishes of the people who live in a political unit or state.

But i also feel we're horribly inadequate to give her an education that will really help her in future, partly our fault (i've had this conversation with my father) but i also feel that Learn Direct have hardly done sod all to help us educate her. She has a tutor that turns up once every month or so, sits with her for an hour and thats it. As far as i'm aware they've never really asked us about her progress or pushed us to get her using more complex office admin software like quickbooks etc. 

But it just shows how easy it is to get someone in on next to nothing and just have them do the petty tasks. It feels like she's just left there to do it without Learn Direct really taking an active interest, they're just getting target ticked off perhaps. They've never really pushed us to help her move forward nor has she (more her own shyness i suspect)  If she chooses not to stay on with us we could easily get another apprentice in to do her job. It sucks watching it happen frankly.

**How do I think this season will go?**

Who the hell knows.

This is Palace, no two seasons are the same, no two games are the same. We're going to be in for ups and downs but, hopefully, no managerial changes. That said, I'm feeling confident this year. We've had poor starts the last two seasons so hoping third time's the charm. I predict a steady season and a top 10 finish. Let's say 8th.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

I'd love to say Cabaye, but there will no doubt be teething problems. So I'm going with McArthur or Dann. Our two rocks. If I had to pick one, it'd be McArthur. He's our very own Scottish Iniesta. 

**How do you think the team will line up?**

It's tough, because we have a lot of midfield options and are constantly changing. And as much as I love Jedi, I prefer Ledley and McArthur in midfield. [I think it'll be like this*.](http://i.imgur.com/FscCD1T.png)

Their approach has ramped up the deficit, has lead to them borrowing more money then every previous Labour government combined, and has lead to all sorts of suffering on a human level.

**most** players play in a very restricted number of positions throughout their career, giving them the maximum chance to improve and grow in a specific position. Lovren has always played as a centre back. 

Contrary to a number of people on this sub, I believe that given another season in a team performing better than the pitiful standard of last season, Lovren can show the type of form that led Brendan to pay Â£20 mill for him. He is the sort of player who relies on confidence - which will come back in droves once the team gels. 

To put a proven CB in a CDM role would be almost suicidal - he would lack the positional awareness, fitness and vision to perform in a position he has never played in before.

Ross Barkley. He's finally had a summer break for the first time in about 3 seasons and like Lukaku, he looks confident. Ross should do well, he's got people to prove wrong and he should do it this season.

11. Students will be required to accept the Shuraâs decision regarding their holidays and how they are spent (Taraweeh, Jamaat etc.). 
12. All elders must be respected particularly the Ustaad and Teachers, immaterial whether the student is studying by him or not, and all those linked to the Institute. 
13. The Institute will not be held responsible if the student leaves the premises without permission or goes to any place other than for which permission has been granted. 
14. All complaints should be referred to the Shura, no parent, guardian or child is allowed to complain to a student or parent/guardian directly. No parent has the right to confront any Ustaad directly. 
15. Students failing to meet the educational standards of the Institute will be subject to the Shuraâs decision. Students failing in any subjects will be required to sit the exams again in Shawwal. Students failing in three or more subjects will be subject to the decision of the Shura. 
16. Parents/guardians will be expected to attend the Madrasah when their presence has been requested. Regarding the well being of their child, parents are strongly advised to spend time in Jamaat with them after the annual exams. 
17. Taking up business or employment or any other vocation which may be a hindrance to studies is strictly prohibited during term time. 
18. Students in boarding must declare any plans of marriage to the Shura. Upon the acceptance of such a request students will have to reside in the Madrasah premises. Subject to Mashwarah, leave to go home will be granted once every two weeks. 
19. Any requests made for leave for Umrah, or to attend weddings, or any other event will be decided in view of the best interest of both the Institute and the student in question. Parents/guardians and students will be expected to accept their decree whole-heartedly.

All students are expected to ensure that their rooms and corridors are kept clean and tidy and to dispose of rubbish at the proper place and not to cause any damage to classrooms, dormitories and corridors or graffiti the walls, toilets or desks. The washing areas are to be left clean after washing clothes and utensils etc. Students should set an example of cleanliness, orderliness, high morals and piety. 
23. Any item not allowed in Madrasah will be confiscated and duly disposed of, e.g. tape players, cassettes, mobile phones and un-Islamic garments etc. Items confiscated will not be returned. 
24. Fees will have to be paid in three instalments, the first being submitted by the end of Shawwal, the second by the 15th Safar and the final payment by 15th Jumadal Ukhra. The Shura will not be able to make any considerations after this date. Parents/guardians will have to accept the consequences of failing to meet these dates. 
25. The management of the Institute reserves the right to dismiss when deemed necessary. Anyone dismissed from the Institute will have no legal remedy against the Institute. 
26. If a student is expelled during his exams or studies the student will be held responsible for any disruption and not the Institute. 
27. It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to take the student immediately from the Institute if he is expelled. The Institute will not be held responsible for any disruption if there is delay in picking him up. 
28. The Madrasah staff, Shura and schoolteachers are well wishers of the students and in the light of their experience wish only the best for them. Whether it is a matter regarding education, Taraweeh arrangements or Jamaat, the Institute will always decide in the best interests of the students. Therefore acting upon their guidance whole-heartedly will, Insha-Allah, assist in making their lives purpose filled and successful. For this reason, it is hoped that once a decision has been made to enrol a student in the Alim or Hafiz courses no alteration will be made during the course of the year. 
29. Clothing not claimed will be given away to charity.

33. A student may be expelled if he does not abide by the rules of the Institute or is the cause of any problem, which in the opinion of the Shura may cause harm to the Institute; its staff or any student. 
ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE MADRASSAHâS RULES WILL BE DEALT WITH FIRMLY. PERSISTENT VIOLATIONS OR ISOLATED MAJOR INCIDENTS WILL RESULT IN EXPLUSION OR ANY OTHER CORRECTIVE MEASURE DEEMED TO BE APPROPRIATE BY THE MANAGEMENT OR SHURA. POWERS TO EXPEL PUPILS LIE WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND SHURA.

Whether it be the improvements in employment law throughout the decades, or the lessening of trade union importance (who the Labour party do maintain a connection to) in society in general, or the machinations of the Thatcher government which limited trade union power, one cannot deny that the labour movement in this country has slowly died and the party has continued onwards, in an uncomfortable, although albeit occasionally electorally successful, centre-left position. It is my honest opinion that without this working class movement the Labour party will never rediscover it's fundamental purpose, and will only be able to define itself in the media as 'slightly different from the tories', especially after the Blair years, and the policies adopted by the Cameron government to alter the ground on social wedge issues such as gay rights and minority rights. To quote Christopher Hitchens (*Hitch-22*, pg.138/139):



&gt; It's all gone now, or gone to pieces, but this was what we used to call ""the Labour movement"".. .. For me, this ""movement"" is everything. It contains within itself the germinal hope of a better future where a thinking working class can acquire the faculties of a serious party of government, and can extend these small early ""reformist"" gains into something more comprehensive.

null,false,Badger_Botherer,null,null,null,"First things first and this effects a lot: you probably hold rights as your arthritis means your disabled as while there's no ""official"" comprehensive list of disabilities, and certainly no clear definition of disability apart from what the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) gives as: -

""a long term condition which can have a substantial effect on day to day activities""

If you're working slower because of your arthritis you are disabled. This gives you very powerful rights, including the right not to be discriminated against without valid reasons e.g. silly example you're now in a wheelchair you can't do your old job of carrying stuff up and downstairs. If you are working slower yet are able to do the job you hold rights as while you are less able than your peers it is because of a protected characteristic.

I'm assuming the OH appt is your boss trying to basically make you scared or try to catch you out and give grounds for you to quit or get sacked.

I'm not sure when your meeting with OH is but you should do three things:

Get a doctor's note or similar regarding your condition from YOUR OWN doctor ASAP File a COPY not the ORIGINAL with your HR department. Get proof of doing this in writing, an email is sufficient. 

I would then raise with OH in the meeting that you feel able to do the job yet your condition is slowing you down. Do not give other reasons despite any prompting, this is your line. I AM WORKING SLOWER ONLY BECAUSE OF MY CONDITION. (Also tell your manager to Fuck off if they attempt to come in, if they persist ask their reasoning and ask for that in writing before saying a word.)

Then the third thing is request a copy of your OH report from their doc before they send it your employer, to check you agree. If you don't raise agree this by email not phone. If they call back, say I only feel comfortable corresponding in writing.

The above is all a bit paranoid, yet if your manager is trying this they are probs a bit of scumbag and are looking for a reason. Don't give them it. Until your sick note/report says the words or similar because of arthritis you will need workplace adjustments or similar be on your best behaviour!",null,0,null,1438030570,null,0,false,0,cti7a3s,null,t3_3et0oi,null,t1_cti7a3s,null,t1_cti609a,null,null,null,1440120737,null,4,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,4,null

By setting red-lines to start with and making a credible threat to vote No if they're crossed, he can force Cameron to pause and wonder if it is worth it to dilute workers rights (one of Blair's dearest achievements).

Everything looks positive. We finished the season brilliantly after Super Al came in and seem to be really going for it. If we get in a new CB and striker, I think another top half finish is quite achievable

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

The obvious answer is Cabaye but I'll say Jason Puncheon. I can't wait to see him in his new role behind the striker for a whole season, linking up with that French bloke we signed recently. First name on the team sheet for me.

**How do you think the team will line up?**

[LineupBuilder](http://i.imgur.com/M6rcula.png) - I see no reason to change the system too much. Cabaye slots into midfield next to McArthur, we keep the 3 in front (Bolasie, Punch, Zaha). Speroni starts as the main keeper but is phased out for McCarthy. Murray plays up top until we get in a proper striker. The defence stays the same until we get a new CB to go next to Dann.

We've got a fairly small squad of decent EPL quality, so it will go well when they are available against teams we can beat, but it won't go well when they're not available and we're playing teams better or equal to us. On balance, I'd hope to finish higher than 13th, if i'm optimistic we could finish 7th, if we're poor we could finish bottom 5. I'd enjoy the season if we were at 40 points by end of January / start of February.

Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

because of our style of play we will always be promoting exciting, fast players quick on the break. Despite those guys getting the plaudits for beating full backs and having plenty of tricks, the workrate of those guys will keep us up - since Pulis managed us they've run up and (more importantly) back down the line making vital contributions at both ends. That being said, our defensive stalwarts and tough tackling midfielders really are the fans superstars. I'd love it to be Zaha closely followed by Cabaye, but it's most likely going to be Dann followed by MacArthur.

How do you think the team will line up?
Pardew is not daft and he will field two team shapes with different line ups. the first is a packed midfield to stop teams playing flowing fast football. Usually with at least one bully up top to frustrate the opposition defenders and take the pressure of our defense by drawing free kicks up the other end. The second shape pushes one or two of the defensive midfielders on and the attacking wingers play less as wing backs and play in a forward 3. The art of these is that they can be played with the same XI players but in reality they are best when our fiercest XI is the more defensive shape and our fastest more exciting XI is the latter - As i mentioned earlier with a small squad, it often ends up as a bastard hybrid. I want to see Chamakh and Cabaye on the pitch together, with Zaha and Bolasie and Puncheon. If Gayle or Murray or Bamford is playing at the top of that, with the wind behind us, they will get chances. I don't see Jedinak getting as much game time this year, but big games against top 6 teams will see him play regularly and get lots of yellow cards.

Right, yes I can see that renationalising eg the railways might be something the EU legislation could stymie but other nations seem to deal with it perfectly well without much fandangery. Perhaps Germany wouldn't like it as DB run some of our trains for example.  Still they get around it in their own country so they can't have too much opposition.  

I think the EU promotes a ""united by corporations"" sort of thing: nations without boarders to business, and that perhaps state ownership as an ideology gets in the way of that in certain sectors.  But I think the EU does that partly because ""EU superstate"" ""public"" ownership is a difficult political sell, not to mention the nightmare of bureaucracy that would cause. Imagine an EU ""transport ministry"" running and owning all the trains in Europe - it's impossible! (At least for now).

Tottenham were relegated as a result of this. He was later banned from football for life for his corrupt business activities. After that, they were bankrolled by the Hill-Wood &amp; Bracewell Smith dynasties, and established themselves as one of the top three most successful clubs in English football history.

Liverpoolâs financial success was built on the fortunes of the Moores family, who owned the Littlewoods Football Pools â basically a gambling racket which exploited the stupidity of the poorest members of society. Prior to the 1960s Liverpool had a very average level of success, but after that they regularly broke transfer records for the best players of the day, who included Kevin Keegan, Ian Rush, Kenny Dalglish, Emelyn Hughes and John Barnes, and won a F-ton of trophies.

As regards Real Madrid and Barcelona, do a small amount of digging and you will find out that they have been the beneficiaries of incredible corruption, which is sadly an indictment of Spanish society over the past 50 years. Real Madrid in particular, were the favoured team of the fascist dictator Franco, who used the success of the team to shape a prosperous international image of Spain &amp; distract the masses from the parlous state of the countryâs economy between 1939 and 1975. It should also be noted that the vast majority of Real Madridâs European cups were won in an era when the level of competition was at a very low level (in fact, Chelsea was barred by the FA from competing for the first European cup in 1955, where we would have been heavily favoured to defeat Madrid â another example of them favouring us throughout the years).

Use a broker/deal site such as orangewheels or CarWow, use the discount available through them as a bargaining tool with your local dealers, which can sometimes bring the price close to, if not below, that of the nearly new equivalent. And if you lease, the APR is often lower on a brand new car compared to nearly new (e.g. Audi 6%ish vs 11%ish, depending on current offers).

I got close to 20% off a brand new A4, with a tiny deposit (6%) and 5.9% APR, so the monthly repayments were Â£30 cheaper than on a nearly new one.

If you want to calculate various options on PCP finance, use pcpcal.co.uk

Although this doesn't apply this time round, it might in future - if you're trading in a car you own, make the deal on your new car before bringing your trade-in to the table. 

If you do lease a new car, get it over 48 months to reduce the repayments, you can trade in/up after 2-3 years anyway. Alternatively, if you decide the car or leasing is not for you, providing you've paid 24 months, you can just give it back and walk away (Audi PCP).

Don't take the dealer/manufacturer GAP insurance, get your own ""Return To Invoice"" through a third-party provider.

Don't take paint protection from the dealer (e.g. Autoglym Lifeshine).

In terms of your second paragraph, I hear it a lot, and I think it's just playing with phrasings to obscure the reality. Their approach certainly has not ramped up the deficit, which has fallen from over 10% to about 5%. The reason they have accumulated more debt is because they were left with a huge deficit by Labour and a collapsing economy, when in 1997 Labour inherited a shrinking deficit and a growing economy.  The idea that you can cut the deficit faster by having a bigger gap between spending and income just doesn't make sense, even when you factor in the stimulus effect. 

As for not needing to cut the deficit so fast, I disagree. There is one thing I'm focused on: whether our debt is higher or lower than the pre-crash level by the time the next recession strikes. Because if it's higher, we will be on a long term upward trend where debt goes up higher each recession that it falls in the recovery. We already spend more money on interest payments than we do on education and defence combined. It's a huge waste of money.

You could check out Forbidden Planet (179 Shaftesbury Ave, London WC2H 8JR), or [The Who Shop](http://www.thewhoshop.com/). They're both shops and they have some really cool stuff in them. 

(Well, actually, I've only ever been to Forbidden Planet, but with a name like ""The Who Shop"", it's going to be pretty cool)

Something else that could be fun would be a sort of location tour. Quick googling found this [walking tour you can book](http://britmovietours.com/bookings/doctor-who-london-tour/), but I was thinking of something a little more independent.  [This website here](http://www.doctorwholocations.net/) has a fairly comprehensive list of different locations, from the classic and new series, and you could plan out a bit of a route from that. It's got London and Cardiff based locations, so that works out. [People take pictures like this](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/08/article-2354574-1AA2AA1D000005DC-641_964x715.jpg) quite a lot, so that could be a fun twist on a photo album type thing you could do. Definitely something to show off here!

What else? Obviously when you're in Cardiff, you should definitely try to check out the Doctor Who Experience. I've been twice (once in London, once in Cardiff), and it's honestly fantastic. There's an interactive walk through adventure type thing, and then what is essentially a museum of all sorts of props and costumes from all 50 years of the show. Plus a little shop at the end. Love a good shop.

The Doctor Who Experience is probably the best thing ""left"", as it were - they've closed down the Blackpool museum, and the Earl's Court Exhibition. I think there's still a Police Box at Earl's Court, though, so that might be a nice thing to check out, if it's not out of your way. (It is literally just a Police Box)

Maybe you could go to the Isle of Wight for a day (it's about an hour on the ferry) and check out [Who One](http://www.whoone.co.uk/), which is in Ryde. Biggest Doctor Who bookshop in the world, I think. That's still smaller than the average WHSmith though! If you're interested in the books from the 90s though, or the Target novels, that could be a good place to check out, buy some, etc.

Something else you should try and do is see if there are any events coinciding with your trip. Occasionally they have actors pop down to the Doctor Who experience, so if you went at a time when one of them did, that'd be cool. Or, alternatively, they do signings as well - Paul Cornell is in the Who Shop on the 15th August, which is obviously a bit early for you, but it's that sort of thing you might want to look out for.

Running elective services at the weekend means you have to have all areas supported-so the operating theatres have to have a full complement of theatre nurses, recovery room nurses, operating dept practitioners, clerical and admin staff to provide support at weekend clinics, technicians, fully staffed laboratories, all the porters, cleaners, cooks, ward clarks etc that make up the vast majority of hospital workers. Its not consultant staff preventing a weekend service, its the lack of all the rest of the team. As a consultant, I can't do very much without the rest of the team, so just forcing me to come in at weekends without providing the rest of the team makes no sense. 

I'm contracted for 44 hours a week-in practice I do around 60, like most of my colleagues, but I get paid for 44. If I work 20 of those hours at weekends, that means half of the week days work doesn't get done. We simply don't have enough consultants to provide a safe and effective 7 day service for routine work, and we don't have enough of anyone else either (nurses and so on) to provide full non-emergency, non-urgent cover for 7 days.

I'd be happy to do routine work at weekends, but if I work Saturday or Sunday, I'll be taking Wed or Thursday off, so what happens to those patients coming in during the week? 

There is far, far more to this-Hunt is trying to obfuscate the whole issue by trying to turn the public against doctors. All that crap about average salaries, and everyone getting bonuses-none of that is true (or if it is, I'd like to know who is getting the rest of my salary).

Couple things here:

-I feel confident that we still will be bringing in this ""playmaker"" that Martinez has said we need.  This is someone we for sure need, and will work on the left hand side with Baines to make the creating in the final third.  Pienaar was great in this role, as he had a great relationship with Baines on the field, but he has clearly lost a step

-With that said that keeps Kev and Gerri on the right side, think they're similar style players, kinda ""flair"" guys who will work off of lukaku, think it will result in Kev's best season with us

&gt;Aston Villa Review: Episode 124 - Delph and Benteke sales headline a busy summer
&gt;The summer transfer window isn't always a whirlwind of excitement for supporters of Aston Villa, but Tim Sherwood hinted at an overhaul and, in combination with the contractual details of a couple of star players, he's delivered emphatically. Chris and Steve return for a new season and begin by assessing the departures of Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke, two players whose exits couldn't have been more different.

&gt;We also discuss Villa's new signings - Micah Richards, Mark Bunn, Idrissa Gueye, Jordan Amavi and today's new recruit, Jordan Ayew - and a couple of key additions to the non-playing staff. Sherwood will be assisted by Ray Wilkins, while there's also a new addition higher up the ladder. Hendrik Almstadt has been brought in as an analytical Sporting Director; it looks like he's made a quick start.

It is entirely possible that a small business will pay less than 10% effective tax rates, if it takes (legitimate, non-avoiding) advantage of the various reliefs available; in certain sectors even quite large enterprises in the million-pound turnover range can wind up paying no tax at all because of specific credits and reliefs - which is one of the reasons the UK is so popular for the film industry, for instance.

Wilf Zaha has shown steady signs of improvement since his return to Palace and this could be a breakout season for him if he gets his consistency levels right and stops being so frustrating!

There are two causes for a CeX store not having cash: one is loads of stuff coming in for cash, resulting in low cash in the afternoon, and the other is a banking request having been made by head office, which results in money needing to be taken to the bank, which can result in low/no cash for the entire day.

Sometimes these banking requests are really fucking harsh. Several times I've had a banking request come in that has completely cleaned us out but for a few hundred quid. When you've got stuff on Test from yesterday waiting to be bought in, it completely paralyses you and you can't do shit. You have to start turning people away for cash because you don't even have enough together to buy in the stuff you've already promised on.

The best time of the day for cash is early on, and the best days are later in the week but before the weekend.

It will also vary from store to store. When I worked there I would contest banking requests with my Ops Manager, who might let me keep a few more hundred in the store. Some managers won't do that, either because they don't think to or they don't have a good relationship with their OM or their OM isn't as commercially awesome. So, as always, YMMV.

Risk reward ratio isn't as good as it used to be. Testing has got better. The best doping options aren't viable any more so the reward is significantly reduced while the risk is higher. Throw in some people having principles and yes I would expect some top level athletes to be clean.

&gt;Jamaica, a country with no native anti-doping blood tests (ie, no out of competition testing, they only started testing finally this year) dominated sprinting for the better part of a decade, and everybody treats it like they're just genetically better or something.

In fairness people of west African descent make up the top sprinters pretty much no matter where they happen to be living. However Jamaica beating out the other areas with west Africans and Powell getting caught.... Well it doesn't look good. Still oxilofrine suggests that they are running out of good doping options.

Promotion is critical to the advancement of treatment of patients.  There are 2 main reasons for this:  
1.  Health care professionals need to be educated in the new treatments available and the new evidence for older drugs used for different medical conditions.  Yes they could read articles (although these are published by pharma companies and are promotional), they could read the journals (again a good portion of the trials reported in journals are run by pharma or funded by pharma companies and can therefore be classed as promotional).  Unfortunately healthcare professionals in the main aren't very pro-active unless they have a medical educational interest in the subject, imagine you are a GP and have to cover a 100 therapy areas it just isn't practical.  The discussion a sales rep has with a doctor should be evaluated with the health care professionals current knowledge and also information from other pharma companies to decide the best treatment for the patient in front of them.
2.  Pharma companies fund the vast majority of research, directly or indirectly, expanding medical knowledge.  Yes they expand it for the benefit of their product, but it is an expansion of knowledge which benefits the patient.  A great example is thalidomide, rightly considered to the dustbin of drugs, but recently brought back to treat cancers, Crohn's disease and others.  Other examples are out there.

If companies don't promote 2nd to market medications which have real advantages over the first to market won't take over, as they should.  because health care professionals wont hear about it.

That being said, the ABPI, should continue to monitor and punish pharma companies when they step out of line.

For the record in the UK, you can no longer give away any freebies (not even post-its or pens), when I repped (pharma obviously) the limit used to Â£7.50 per item (everything I had was crap).

You can still do lunch meetings, but they must have a medical content (I am not naive enough to state that this is probably broken), and as such provide food.

In the mean time the Labour party has been hollowed out in Scotland and starts collapsing to the SNP in the Scottish parliament elections. 

In comes Miliband who inherits this shit show, while not being the most competent person in the world, he hits the final nail in the coffin for Scottish Labour by parading about with the Tories, telling the Scottish to stay in the UK or else, which we could have dealt with if Scottish Labour actually had any members who believed in the Labour party. So he loses Scotland and this scares the English away from voting Labour because of the fear they would have been supported by a bunch of people who only care about Scotland, and couldn't give a damn about the UK.

Miliband, not being inspiring to the general public doesn't manage to overcome all those factors and predictably loses but he did inspire a generation of Young people, which I include myself in, which might be Labour's only hope.

No phrasing being played with, I know the difference between the debt and deficit. Just stating that the Tories pledged to get rid of the deficit by 2015 and failed, they can't keep blaming Labour for this. It's also untrue that they were left with a collapsing economy, the economy was growing when they took over, after which said growth slowed. It doesn't make sense, but the idea Corbyn is pushing is that investment increases the income, and reduces spending in areas like welfare.

I see what you mean, the issue we have is that the deficit has not been cut effectively using austerity, and that other methods could and probably would have been much better. Cutting spending and taxation certainly isn't a good way of reducing a deficit.

Just had to fill in a form online (medical issues? criminal record? qualifications), pay Â£200 and within 5 hours i had an email back saying that I was accepted!! 

Engineering jobs actually exist in Australia which is great (their job market is kinda shit at the moment.. I ended up working on a horse farm..) so I'd say you have a good shot in all of the major cities, but maybe better around Perth or Adelaide because less people go there?

I saw [this](http://www.hays.com.au/career-advice/coming-to-australia-784) and they talk about job interviews *before* coming to Aust, so that'd be good!! 

Rent in the cities is quite expensive, I'd compare it with large cities in England (maybe not quite London..) so you'd probably want to look into a flatshare or end up paying Â£1000 a month. Many people live in hostels for a while and there are plenty of meet up websites were you (obviously) can meet people and arrange living from there.

So I guess I'd advise maybe Â£3000 to be safe. (Like one months rent, plus a one month rent bond (aka deposit) and then extras to live on.. going to the max end of the budget)

Also opening a bank account is really easy, i went with commonwealth bank and all they needed was my passport, not even proof of address or anything, also because we're British (if you have a british passport...) you're entitled to a degree of free health care because of a reciprocal care agreement between the NHS and Medicare, so I got a free eye test and you can get free GP visits and that kind of thing (ambulance call outs are like Â£400 so don't do anything stupid!!) 

One thing about Australia is that unless you live in the CBD or near a train station, it can be hard to get around. Cities are so big and sprawling so driving is the easiest way to get about! (But if you were to get a flatshare in the city centre you'd be sweet); Car insurance is super cheap though, me and my bf got covered fully comp on a big station wagon for 12 months for just over Â£200!

Looking for Â£110 + shipping.

I can show footage of the card working if requested. 

(As a side note, the card overclocks fairly well on the core, but not so well on the memory)

Police Station Defence work used to be hourly, it is now a flat attendance fee. It's most often farmed out to Reps who have no formal legal qualifications at all, or are training. They have to be on call 24/7 365, they have to attend Police Stations anywhere in their area within an hour, they have to take mulitple phone calls all hours. From arriving at a police station, getting disclosure, speaking to the client, and then completing the interview can be anywhere from an hour minimum to 10 hours plus. COmplex investigations or repeated interviews can take much longer. For this they get a flat fee -less than Â£100 IIRC. From that you have to pay travel, parking perhaps, salary. 1 hour, it's good money, the average is much closer to 3-4 hours. And that goes to the firm remember, not the individual. 

Then you have criminal Defence work. That will require probably 2-4 appearances at court for a few minutes to a few weeks. IT will require the receipt (or fighting to receive) of several hundred pages of documents all of which must be read, cross referenced checked for errors. There might be some further work to do as well. You have to meet the client, take instruction.

You'd be amazed how time consuming all of this is, how many letters, phone calls, arguments in court, demands for paperwork or evidence, reports, further work, perhaps visiting your client in prison in afarawy place multiple times, detailed reading of cases... It takes hours and hours even for a simple case.

NICE is one part of the equation, but they can not constantly upgrade their guidance, as clinical trials are being published pretty much daily (across multiple areas).  It would become a logistical nightmare to assess the new data, the new clinical clinical effectiveness, and the new value proposition (the cost to benefit ratio).

The problem is, how do you get the information out to health care professionals quickly and effectively.  NICE is not the way.  If you don't get the information out, then a large majority of patients will not benefit from the new treatments.

I realise they played together at Ajax, but I think the EPL holds much more of an aerial challenge, especially when thinking about the likes of Benteke signing for Liverpool, the trouble Fellaini gave us last year etc. 
spursfantatic.com ran a great piece that mentioned Toby's shortcomings in the air, having only won 53 percent of his aerial battles last year.
While I don't doubt that Toby's a great player/signing, I'm not convinced that Jan will be his de facto partner for much of the season. His form was poor last year, and I wonder if the physicality of the league will force Spurs to line up with one of Faz, Dier or Wimmer.
One more point and then i'll stop ranting: I think now would be a bad time to invest heavily in a defensive midfielder. Signing someone like McCarthy would be really costly, and somewhat of a risk considering he hasn't yet hit the form that would justify a massive pricetag. Given that United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal have all spent a ton of money in the last few transfer windows (something that we don't want to compete with at the moment), why not ease our expectations of the season, and give someone like Alli time to gain experience in the league. I'm sure that if Bentaleb hadn't been allowed so many games so early in his career to find his feet, he wouldn't have matured so quickly into the player that we are all so excited about now.",null,0,null,1438038116,null,0,false,0,ctic27q,null,t3_3e0bed,null,t1_ctic27q,null,t3_3e0bed,null,null,null,1440123057,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

We get one on the 12th in Ardoyne. Loyalists were decking people left right and centre when the No vote came out in Glasgow, its about as much as riot as you get here these days and I can guarantee most/all of them are influenced by ulster loyalism and know loyalists over here, pretty much the same group of people apart from the accents. 

Sometimes you get kids acting a bollocks places like Short Strand, these days its not so much sectarian as it is a pack of rats wanting to scrap with each other, the kids acting a bollocks usually know each other, they buy grass from each other, they go to the same classes at tech. Weekend comes they want a scrap. Strange as it. They're the generation that didn't live through any of the troubles. Go to Glasgow and you hear more sectarian shite on a night out than you will in Belfast, because we lived through it and most people are actively moving away from it. I think that distance from the troubles is a big part. You get the same shite with arseholes in Dublin who eat sleep and shite in ther Celtic tops and suck the balls of the Wolfe Tones - never lived through it.
