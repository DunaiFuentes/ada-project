If Sterling stays at Liverpool the next years I think he'd get another wage increase with 23 and another one with 26.

&gt; Is South Africa then a Third World country? How not? The criteria of development are the per capita income and the extent to which the population is engaged in industry. A typical First World country has a per capita income of between $10,000 and $15,000 a year and ninety-five per cent of its population in industry or urban services and five per cent in agriculture. Furthermore, agriculture is really a modern and very mechanized industry. The only exception is New Zealand where a far larger proportion is engaged in a very modern, very industrialised agriculture. And South Africa? Per capita income is $2,000. Population engaged in industry and urban services is about fifty per cent. And the agricultural sector still contains millions of people engaged in traditional subsistence-style activities.

What is striking is that transport - the price of petrol and diesel - *was not a factor this month in the drop in the inflation rate, because oil prices have risen a bit.*

So the driver of falling inflation looks to be the strength of sterling, especially against the weakening euro - which is reducing the cost of imports.
The important point is that, for now at least, the fall in the price of food, games, petrol and energy, if it persists for a few months, is good news for most of us - because it increases our spending power and our pounds go further.

The vegetarian diet is restrictive by its very nature, unfortunately to have a hope of maintaining balance and health the diet needs to be quite regimented and people don't necessarily get to eat what they most enjoy. The Self Nutrition Data site is helpful: you select a food then set serving sizes to the officially recommended ones and it tells you how much of every micronutrient that supplies.

It's very likely Atletico are going to buy out the Alderweireld clause, as they can make a lot more. Considering how, excuse my belgian, fucking amazing he is, we need to match the price of our contenders.

I think Schneiderlin is dead set on going regardless of where we finish, Clyne I'd say is about 50/50 at the moment, I'd like to think he is looking at Shaw and contemplating his decision.

Seen Trippier's name thrown around a lot, while I agree he is a good Right Back, I just don't think he is the matieral we need to be aiming at this window, he is good don't get me wrong, but he isn't going to light the PL on fire from a RB perspective, like Clyne and Ivanovic. 

Our other loans being Djuricic and Elia. I don't think either is a dead set in the squad yet, I'm more partial to Djuricic then I am to Elia, Elia started off well, but in the games he was given before he was dropped, he seemed lack luster, but hey, so did Mane.

We need to go out and buy a 20 goal a season striker, we're the only team, theoretically, in the top 7 who doesn't have one, we need one.

I think we're going to have to keep an eye on Tadic too, he started off really well and was a machine in the goal creation department, he needs to regain that form, or I think we're gonna need someone else/along side him to do that, as our delivery in the final third isn't the best at the moment, and people don't seem to be linking up well with one another.

I can't begin to list out replacements off of the top of my head, it's something I haven't given much thought to. But I think we need to start looking for some higher quality players.

Where did you learn your history? It's well documented this was a colossal cock up.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6926464.stm

&gt; See the Mountbatton plan

The Radcliffe Line had no involvement from the people you're talking about. You've completely missed the point.

&gt; I don't see how the British are responsible for violence perpetrated by various Indian/Pakistani populations on eachother for religious reasons.

""The viceroy, Mountbatten, must take the blame - though not the sole blame - for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished, The British government and Mountbatten must bear a large part of the blame for this tragedy."" Christopher Beaumont - Radcliffe's secretary and the man who helped draw the line.

For someone so knowledgeable about history you seem to have missed this along with a well known play by Bretton called Drawing the Line.

""Radcliffe had a dark night of the soul in the bungalow: he refused to accept his fee, he did collect all the papers and draft maps, took them home to England and burnt them. And he refused to say a word, even to his family, about what happened""

But since then, over the years, I've been able to look at him more objectively, and really appreciate him as a player. He does also seem to have matured more as a man, albeit he's far from what I'd describe as likeable.

I still would be more inclined to be uncomfortable with his signing, the status of rag hero/legend would be difficult to contend with. Tevez wasn't held in such high esteem and we adopted him as our own, and he truly despised Taggart and that endeared us to him even further.

Tranaldo truly is a rag legend though, and still has a soft spot for them clearly. That makes the prospect of him donning sky blue a bit grim.

But he is truly world class though, for how much longer though is debatable. But the biggest attraction is how much it would utterly heartbreak rags the world over, that would be utterly priceless. (Who can forget this cringefest: http://youtu.be/dBbSPIOG3yc).

There are two sets of international games; there is the pointless international friendlies and then there is international competition that teams win major trophies. The vast majority of football fans will enjoy watching the world cups. And all the other continental cups that are usually held after the end of the season. But, these international friendlies held during the season are just waste of time and money. I never understood the reasoning behind playing star players every time just to see if they will perform better with almost the same set of players. What difference doesn't it make? They are not training for major competition that's right on the corner. They are doing anything amazing that might help them in the near future. What kind of training can they give them in a very short period of time that will improve how team's performance? Why don't they use this opportunity to see how their fringe players will perform and promote them if they are good? It doesn't even matter how these star players perform in these friendlies. Every national team coach will almost always pick their stars players during international competitions. Also, FIFA doesn't pay clubs lots of money when players are injured. No one would have been bothered by it, if they weren't disruptive to club's season. We are in crucial stage of the season and a single match might even change the fate of a club.

For my rape and humiliation by the Iron Lady,

They had taken over the whole hotel for the week and it sounds as if they were ordering their evening meals in the morning so the kitchen could serve them all efficiently in the evening at some set time. The hotel sent the chef and restaurant staff home when they didn't show up after two hours which was fair enough.

But the job of a producer is to handle this kind of logistics. He should have either phoned the hotel to keep them in the loop about the delay, or bundled everyone out of the pub and into the helicopter to make sure they arrived before the kitchen shut. That is basically his job. I doubt that JC would have stayed drinking in the pub if he thought they'd miss their dinner. In fact it might even be that he and the team were in the pub waiting for the helicopter to arrive and would have happily come out if they'd been told it had arrived.

I agree.  If you want to stand in a room and look like a moron waving your 'jazz hands' whilst everyone else is clapping then go ahead.  But, this group took a vote on it!  They want these rules to apply to everyone in their group.

&gt;Even if someone with anxiety issues will, or wants to, speak publicly in future, I think it's useful for them to have the opportunity to do that in a less intense and pressured environment.

Yes, maybe if you're six years old.  But these are university students! This is the time when you start practicing for proper adult intellectual life.

If the SNP want a role at Westminster then it is **them** that needs to offer concessions. Labour and the Conservatives will both be walking around with something like 270+ seats. The SNPS 46-52~ seats is small change. Its not worth the trouble the SNP will make to labour for what will be a small majority anyway. **UK governments don't need a majority**. It's obviously helpful if they do, and in recent memory they have tended to. However historically it's not always been the case and probably won't be this time. For example, the SNP don't want to renew Trident... but the Lib Dems, Labour and UKIP all want to as well as the Tories... so the Tories could probably pass a trident renewal bill through parliament even if the SNP didn't want it despite them being the third largest party. Essentially it would make the tories an issue-by-issue government and they'd have to make their bills appealing to Labour or the Lib Dems and UKIP. SNP support is not a given. In reality the SNPs position is actually deceptively weak. Just look at what happened to the Lib dems.

Provided you can legislate, you can govern. That is the threshold for forming a government, not a magic number on a piece of paper that technically means a majority.

null,false,apinkknee,null,null,null,"So I'm just going to poke some holes in and get your thoughts, because as well-minded as this seems, it would be completely the wrong direction of Poch's philosophy, or rather, the philosophy that we assume Poch is playing for. 

**Defensive duties:** 3 at the back.     
You're suggesting to remove two full-backs, push them higher to wing-backs, and introducing another centre-back. One of two things can happen here:    

- The centre backs play wider to cover the width lost leaving larger gaps between the centre-backs for streaky forwards and 10's to disrupt, or    
- We keep them narrower and expose the flanks. 

Here's why that setup fails to work for the players we currently have on offer:

1. Effective 3 at the back needs one of two things in the midfield to be an effective defensive system, and that is either smart wing-backs that have great decision making skills and drop deep to cover the exposed wing, or a deep holding mid whose main job is to allow the centre-backs to spread out. We do not have either of those. Walker even as a Fullback fails to make the correct decisions and gets caught way too high up the pitch. Rose is a touch better, but still prone to error. They're more effective at traditional fullbacks. 
2. One of the three backline members needs to be so vocal that he would commandeer a small country with only his whispers. None of the proposed back three do that. If at any time that back-line breaks its cohesivenvess, the gig is up. 
3. Two ball-playing defenders need to rely on a midfielder who is a world class distributor from deep in the mid-field. Bentaleb is currently that guy who picks it up deep and distributed. I am not confident he is ready for that, but my opinion (obviously). (See notation below re: Alonso/Pirlo/Mashisio)
4. Poch makes the boys play a high-pressing, high backline game. Placing 3 at the back on a highland is asking for trouble. Liverpool doesn't play as high and as such, doesn't suffer from being countered as easily. Granted, individual errors cause meltdowns. (See notation below: Wolfsburg)

*Disclaimer: I'm more of a fan of  defensive tactics and my knowledge there is better than my attacking, although they go hand in hand to some extent.*

**Midfield**: The 4 midfield members, two deep with the wingback and the two advanced, require at least one major holding player. Take your pick on the day, but Lucas is smarter than he is a great footballer. He rarely gets caught so far out to damage the shape. Mason or Bentaleb are still young, lack the mental resolve; they're learning. Gaps, gaps, gaps. If you want a great example of someone in this role, see Marshisio against Juventus recently, or Pirlo in place of him. Such awareness. And if you want to see how it all unravels you only need to look back to Bayern's loss to Wolfsburg where Alonso couldn't effectively play that deep role that he loves to do. Pressing him caused him to be invariably invisible. Bayern went into a 3-4-2-1 in the second half at some point and while the flanks were then great, they simply were crushed because of their inability to play direct/forward passes. 

The top two of Eriksen/Lamela/Dembele is a big god damn mess; Lamela has spent the last 1.5 years learning how to be an IF or traditional winger (depending on how he appears to feel on the night/instructed) and moving him back centrally will only confuse the poor kid. What you have to understand is that Lamela dwells on the ball, and that is **GREAT** for a defender. It allows time to solidify, challenge, or remove passing lanes. When he was out wide and lost the ball, our boys were usually more prepared and organized, however I fear that losing a ball anywhere between the half-way and final-third would create havoc with counter-attacks, especially on our exposed 3-man-back-theory (See notation above: Wolfsburg-Bayern). 

I'm out of time tonight to talk attacking measures, but that's not my strong suit. I think the 3 at the back would work, but we are lacking that smart deep player (see above) and high-positional/decisional awareness by Wing-backs.

Several TDs from different parts of the south have been at these meetings as well, indicating unity between north and south on the issue and real passion when it comes to fighting the money grabbers.

SF are populist - they'll do anything to get their votes. That being said, they have delivered quite a bit up here and are generally the progressive, modern, and sane (if you can call it that) counter-part to the lunacy of the DUP. I guess they need to be a bit populist in the south though as ye's generally have the same sort of view on SF as the unionists up here do.

That's the point though, isn't it. Nobody would have allowed it to get as bad. The IMF would have extended the loans, both Russia and the US would have been bending over backwards to provide advisors and receive assurances that stability would ensue. 

The media would have made a far bigger deal of it in many countries and so international interest would have been on Ukraine to sort their shit out. 

As it was, it was allowed to spiral out of control and Russia struck when Putin saw that he could grab Crimea with little repurcussion. 

Think about how much the civil war has cost Ukraine - in human capital as well as material and land. A couple of billion every ten years is pretty small fry comparably. 

In this day and age Nuclear weapons are essentially insurance. You pay to be part of the 'too big to fail' club. 

&gt;Majority is spent in the US on the Lockheed martin missiles

The majority isn't, actually. The majority is spent on the warheads and the Submarines, both indigenous. Total costs are $15Bn in 2005/6 money according to wiki - of which $2.5Bn went to the US for missiles according to the Trident II D-5 page - and considering what they do and the amount that the US paid for them ($40Bn), we're basically getting a massive discount ($25mil. per unit vs. $70mil. per unit)

&gt;So build non-nuclear subs. The missiles are bought from the US anyway.

The warheads aren't, which are the important bit - and there's a fair amount of collaboration and technology sharing going on thanks to the 1958 UK-US mutual defence agreement.

While that seems really reasonable, it's not exactly figuring out **why* Walker is left out so often. Does anyone have anything to show for Naughton's game time with Townsend? Was he left out 2v1?  I can't recall. Because we can see the correlation that Townsend doesn't track back, does that actually mean causation occurs? The stats are essentially useless because they don't tell us where, when, or under what reasons Townsend has tackled/intercepted or lost the ball or fouled. Is Townsend giving away more balls once he is tired and Lamela doesn't? The stats don't tell the whole story. Does Walker get caught out of his own accord because he can't play a player out of position or remove opportunities? 

What I do agree with is that I don't believe Townsend's workrate is as high as Lamela's, albeit, I can't speak to any instructions either player is given. 

While I hate to shit on Walker, because his work-rate seems astronomical, he lacks the intelligence most for the time defensively to really become a world-beating full-back.

The NHS waiting list for therapy was over a year long when I was first diagnosed, and they said that since I was no longer in any immediate danger (my family were looking after me following the suicide attempt), that I'd keep being pushed down the bottom of the list, so - basically - forget it.

All I will say is, you hold the law up as a code which can never be strayed from, which I can understand, but you have to consider the nature of law. The law today is vastly different than it was 300 years ago, to do that, somebody had to throw out the old laws, or rather, overrule them. It is necessary for laws to change, and therefore, can't be used as a constant source of guidance, because if we continued following laws written 2000 years ago, we'd be considered barbaric by others today, even though from your perspective you are following the same absolute rules.

Laws are fluid, and reflect the needs and desires of the population and state. In this case, both the population and state would suffer for having such a huge number of people in prison, and the public does not want it. Therefore, not every assault charge is pressed. If every assault case, for whatever reason, was pressed, the law would be rewritten to prevent that fact, be it by a precedent set in the reduction of charges (which, defined by law at the moment, carries no minimum charge), or a change in the definition of assault.

As it stands, the current system ensures that all assault victims can press charges as the current definition of assault includes rather minor stuff, and that the punishment can vary greatly depending on the severity, all of this is made possible by discretion. Another system would either leave some assault victims with their assault not counting as assault, or an overall 'cheapening' of the charges, meaning that someone shoving someone else would carry the same punishment as someone ambushing and attacking someone, which would carry a sentence below prison time.",null,0,null,1427247077,null,0,false,0,cpprv8m,null,t3_306mz1,null,t1_cpprv8m,null,t1_cpprddh,null,null,null,1431996569,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It affects the other stats because if you're in the right place at the right time, then you might not need to tackle or intercept, but you've closed down the dangers anyway. You just need to watch games to understand that.

I'd say Vlaar's stats are skewed because positionally he's very good. He's generally quite a considered defender as well, rarely rash (though the penalty he gave away a few weeks ago was horrible).

Of course, these stats also depend on the opposition and how much defending we were made to do.

So, all in all, those stats mean jack shit.

That all having been said, Clark this season has come on leaps and bounds on his positioning. He's a real leader at the back and he's brave. I think he's our player of the season and it seems like he's finally fulfilling his immense promise.

I'm 24, nearly 25, and I fall pretty much into the N.E.E.T category (although I do have a part time job). I came out of school with 2 GCSE's, I still got into college but dropped out. Went to college again after my first job because I wanted to be a nurse, I felt I did quite well at first, I got accepted into 4 out of 5 great uni's, but I began to struggle again and started to lose my sense of direction. I always start of fantastically, achieving high marks, then I reach a mental wall and lock up. I can't focus and fall behind then depression gets hold of me. Last year I finally got my maths GCSE, I've never been able to focus in education (I've been told I have ADHD which would kind of make sense), in fact I find it hard to focus on anything at all (even so much as a simple conversation), but I pushed myself. For the record I've never been sacked, I always give my job 200%. I had struggled with finding work prior to passing my maths and was really looking forward to it increasing my chances. 

Here I am, still, basically unemployed working a few hours a week, giving the job everything so I can get more shifts, which appears to be working for now. Living at home with my parents who are growing tired of having a man child, who hasn't done what they managed to do when they were my age.

Luckily I have had friends and family give me temp jobs to keep me going. The only job I have got myself was working at McDonald's. I've been applying for jobs solidly since my last one ended in late 2014 (though I admit recently I've fallen short, I've been struggling to actually get out of bed which doesn't help at all). Every job I apply for has had countless other applicants prior to mine. I had a plan for this year, to finally establish myself and become independent, it's what I dream of. But I can't because I can't get a job - I might hear back from 1 or 2 out of 10 jobs I apply for if I'm lucky and they're automated telling me I didn't get accepted. I would go around town asking people in person if there were jobs going, if there were I would head to the library and throw together a covering letter to accompany my C.V then hand it in. I've done work experience to bolster my C.V. to make it more appealing for certain jobs I was going for. Still nothing, not even a fucking retail job working with a bunch of 16 year olds. 

I'm basically at the end of my tether, my plan has failed miserably and I'm stuck in this hole and I've lost faith. I want to be independent, have my own place, go to work and come home to my own home. Go on holidays, see the world. Instead I have barely enough motivation to leave the house anymore, I spend time looking at friends on social media sites who have made it. I'm seeing a girl who is currently on holiday with a rich guy who is younger than me and desperate to make her his, she still tells me she only wants me but I can't help this feeling of being inadequate. Not a single day goes by where I don't consider suicide. I don't see myself ever being successful, I feel completely drained of all that drove me a few months ago. It's an escape from this feeling of not having a place to fit in. My last hope is a tiny amount of inheritance in 2 months that will allow me to move out (since my father has had enough), but money won't get me a job, it will all go on rent and debits and food.

I honestly don't fucking know what to do, how the fuck do I get a job when no one will give me one? Where am I going wrong? It's so incredibly frustrating and disheartening. I just want to work.

On top of this, individual universities usually have a bursary system and as far as I'm aware, a lot of them offer at minimum a non-repayable £1000 grant in your first year for students whose household income is &lt; £~42k. Additionally, most offer further grants and bursaries for students who do well in their A-Levels (including A-Level equivalents). Just Google '&lt;university name&gt; bursaries' and you should find more in-depth info specific to your university.

Failing that, as lelony suggested, get a job over summer and save, or get a part-time job whilst you're at uni.

Good luck! :)

There's been plenty of suicides round my way. A month or two back it was a man found hanging around the back of a Tescos in some scrub land, a few months before a woman had walked out of her family home and was found a few weeks later floating in the river. Seeing little throwaway articles about the latest hanging is getting all too familiar. 

A few people I knew at various schools years ago either attempted or have been successful in later life. Finding their name in the paper is rather cold. Looking back I wish I'd got to know them better.

And I constantly think about it for a great many reasons. 

A friend of mine, whilst I bear no great grudge, more or less had things handed to him by his divorcee father. He always had the latest things and extras besides, his college and Uni tuition were paid off in full, and Dad put down the whole deposit on a house. I think he even paid half the mortgage. There were a quite few I knew like that growing up.
We don't talk any more, but from what I gather he's doing rather well.

In comparison, whilst I wasn't completely hard done by, I have no prestigious (or otherwise) degree and they seem to be a necessity these days regardless of subject; my CV would read like a bad joke; my circle of friends has dwindled to almost nil; and the talents I do have are not in great demand in the locality. And to top it all, like a bitter little cherry on top, I have no intimate relationship. I did not walk ""The Path"" modern British society deems as standard. School, uni, job, better job, marriage, kids...

I feel surplus to requirement. I imagine that's how many men feel.

I can only see things working out in one of two ways for me: either do something out the ordinary and hope against all reasonable expectations that it pays off, to gain that sliver of respect from others and for myself. Or a belt a few feet off the floor.

Maybe I've vented a tad too much, but maybe it will help someone out reading this.

I think that he and City would definitely use the resources better than Pelle. The one thing I see similar in both is that they don't seem to fire the team up as much as I'd like them to.

The holding mid bit - this sounds like more of a role for a 2 CB formation to me. Would he just drop into the back line? Because that sounds to me like it's just creating a 4 man back line again. And if he does stay in midfield, how would that help them spread apart? Wouldn't there still be large channels for the strikers to exploit?

&gt; Two ball-playing defenders need to rely on a midfielder who is a world class distributor from deep in the mid-field.

Why's that? If you have CBs prepared to contribute to the buildup, wouldn't that relieve some of the ball playing pressure (so to speak) from that midfielder?

He'd be absolutely gold for us in the Champions League, not even Mourinho has as good a track record in Europe as Ancelotti does, and he usually also makes great transfers to strengthen the squad in the right places. With that said, he's never been great on a domestic level. He won the Serie A once in his 8 years at AC Milan where over the course of his tenure he had several squads that should have won it with ease. Last year he won the CL with Real Madrid but ended up finishing 3rd in La Liga, that's simply how it is with Ancelotti, he's much better in Europe than he is domestically, and while he has won the Premier League before we shouldn't expect his arrival to give us nearly as big a boost domestically as it'd do in Europe. I could see us finishing 3rd or 2nd in the PL with his arrival but maybe make the big jump to the Semis in CL with his arrival.

It also needs to be said that he does have problems with rotation, he prefers to play the same squad throughout the entire season as much as possible, and that does cause fatigue issues. It's happening at Real Madrid right now too, Kroos is completely battered and Bale is messed up mentally at the moment, but he still doesn't give them a break.

Overall I'm not sure he'd be an improvement over Pellegrini, because he really isn't nearly as strong on a domestic level and I'm sure Pellegrini can make it further than R16 in the CL as long as we don't have to face Barcelona every time.",null,0,null,1427272015,null,0,1427272351,0,cpq1mbo,null,t3_306y0k,null,t1_cpq1mbo,null,t3_306y0k,null,null,null,1432001235,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

The report isn't saying HS2 is useless, just that there's better way to reach its aims.

It's aims are to increase capacity, and rebalance the economy away from London. It's rubbish at both of those.  
  
The report says the most crowded trains are commuter ones (ie, not Leeds/Manchester to London) and as for rebalancing the economy

&gt; ""In terms of rebalancing, London is likely to be the main beneficiary from HS2. Investment in improving rail links in the North of England might deliver much greater economic benefit at a fraction of the cost.""

As if we didn't all already know that. Who needs to go to London *regularly* from the North of England (compared to other northern cities anyway)?

null,false,HashPram,null,null,null,"&gt; You don't want to jump on a single comfortable, spacious train and be able to go to any major city in the UK in a couple of hours or less?

It's not quite as simple as that.

1. The train will leave on a schedule, not ""when I'm ready"". If I want to leave especially early (I usually get up some time between 5 and 6) then unless there's an early train I'll have to hang around waiting for one.
2. I will need to get to the train station. Depending on the station this will take 10-15 minutes, 20 minutes or 30-40 minutes by car; more by bus.
3. I'll need to cart my luggage around with me. Fine if all I've got is a backpack: If I've got a 20kg case it's less easy;
4. Train tickets can cost quite a lot of money. Sure, if I buy them in advance they are considerably less costly. If I want to go somewhere on a whim though - to just 'jump on a train' - that will cost me quite a lot of money.
5. Possession of a ticket doesn't guarantee you a seat. In my car I own the entire vehicle and can sit where I like. No, I can't stand up, but by the same token I'm unlikely to be forced to stand up for 2 hours because the car's full.
6. Trains aren't *that* spacious or comfortable. Yes they're usually more spacious and comfortable than a car, but I wouldn't describe either as my ideal of spaciousness or comfort. It's certainly not going to be the thing that draws me in, although the lack of these things is likely to make me think twice.
7. The only time I don't get travel-sick is on a smooth airplane flight, or while driving. Any other journey leaves me feeling queasy.

The only places I'd currently consider travelling to by train would be London or cities in Scotland or the South coast. And I'd only consider going by train to London if I could book sufficiently far ahead to make it cheaper than the cost of fuelling the car. Discounting the South coast, London &amp; Scotland I can be at any major destination in the UK in less than 4 hours - most I can reach within 2.",null,0,null,1427274989,null,0,false,0,cpq271l,null,t3_307qe9,null,t1_cpq271l,null,t1_cpq1v5d,null,null,null,1432001505,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

£50bn could go a long way towards upgrades to rail on a truly national level, rather than just one line to serve a few cities that already have it pretty good in rail terms. A network at a universally half-decent standard rather than gold plating the same parts of the country while others continue to rot

125+mph, electrified and high frequency is quite far away from the Victorians. The South West meanwhile is basically a working railway museum. 

Or there are other infrastructure upgrades that could make a real difference. A fraction of the money would build a truly futureproof, universal broadband network (not the half-assed effort we are getting)

- get money every month out of your current account and into somewhere else (in another bank, prob a cash ISA?) - that is often enough to get some money saved. Even if you have to dip in occasionally it will help - target here is £500 per month

- when you have a good month you need to stick some money away from your current account. 

- start a pension ASAP - you only get once change to put money away and have it grow for decade (and benefit from the compound interest). Remember that this is tax free - so you will get relief on your contirbutions. 

- if you are freelance make sure you are saving appropriate amount of earnings into another account for paying your tax bill so you don't need to scrabble about at the end of the year. If you put 25% away people usually find they get to keep a bunch at tax return time (need to keep good records here). Make sure you are claiming for everything you can in terms of expenses. 

- rent is pretty high - assume that is in London / south-east? At that amount of money I would be disappointed not to be able to eventually swap it for a mortgage - is there any prospect of moving somewhere where you can afford a house in the future?

- partner could get some part time work the sole objective of saving that money for the future?

- your car is pretty expensive for someone that has no savings at all... Next time you get a car you need to get that down to less than £200 per month. (What did you get for £390!?) There are lots of nice cars for that kind of money - if you can get a loan then a second hand Volvo or Modeo are great family cars.

Well part of the issue here is that if your forced to provide a service to somebody that you don't want to. Then it is taking away your freedom and rights and prioritizing the other persons.

There are lots of situations that can test these things and typically common sense prevails in most cases. But in the case of drug dealer or thief. Assume a hypothetical situation where somebody shop lifts. Then is prosecuted and punished within the law he serves his ""time"" then returns to the shop and the owner refuses him access. Should the owner then be liable for discrimination? I would certainly hope not.

How do you go about starting a pension. I was under the impression that NI contributions go towards that.

How is the £35bn estimated? I guess also it depends on the technology (PON vs active ethernet) and who is doing it. BT has ducts and poles that no one else has, which would make it much cheaper.

There's a sound reasoning for having one company own the network, though - having a crappy patchwork quilt of networks will take us closer to the US where you get one ISP and that's it.

Down here there's a shitload of totally unprofitable FTTP already. They've spent money running fibre to poles serving rural farmhouses in the middle of nowhere (but the farmhouse doesn't actually have the service), or poles that don't even have any copper users on them. Meanwhile, other people in Cornwall have been told to look at satellite internet. It's a total lottery and it's ridiculous.

&gt;The Tories have a plan to win this election: they will refuse to tell the truth about their own record of failure in government, and they will try to smear our party, our leader, and our vision for the country too.

&gt;It’s as simple as it is ugly — and they’re going to be spending huge sums of money on everything from glossy leaflets to targeted online ads to do it. We can’t outspend the Tories to rebut their smears, and we can’t rely on the media to do it for us (spoiler: they won’t). So we’re taking matters into our own hands — and that’s where you come in. 

&gt;We’re calling it the Labour Response Team — a team of grassroots activists fighting back by exposing the Tories’ dirty tactics and highlighting their real record.

&gt;I’m looking to recruit a few thousand of Labour’s most committed  members and supporters to join this new team — and I want you to be a part of it.

&gt;Here’s how it works: when the Tories attack us or try to run from their record, we’ll email you with the facts you need to know and a  graphic, article or blog post to share however you like (on Facebook,  Twitter or over email, for example).

&gt;It may not sound like much, but people often trust people they know more than the politicians they see on TV. Your voice will carry weight– and working together, we can make sure the facts drown out the Tory spin.

&gt;So, will you join our Response Team?

&gt;Today is a good example of the Tories’ real agenda. They are refusing to come clean about their plans to raise VAT after the election, but  they’ve tried this before – three times in the last few elections, Tory chancellors have raised VAT after promising they had no plans to do so.

&gt;This is *exactly* the kind of thing we need to be highlighting.

&gt;Will you join the Labour Response Team to help do it?",null,0,null,1427279590,null,0,false,0,cpq33bi,null,t3_308lho,null,t1_cpq33bi,null,t3_308lho,null,null,null,1432001929,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

Hating the Russian government is not equal to hating Russians. I know you Kremlin bots would like to paint it as such, but i actually like many aspects about Russia. Its government is just not one of them.

&gt;  Stop drinking the koolaid and come back to earth, there will be no ww3.

If Putin stopped invasions of Europe and Asia then I agree.

&gt; The civil war started before Russian intervention in the eastern regions.

Its not a civil war when Russia is invading...

&gt; You are living in a fantasy world if you think Russia is going to collapse AND start WW3 by invading a series of backwater Baltic states. 

Yeah, keep believing that. Exactly like Putin said of Crimea, ""we do not care about Crimea, that is for Ukraine""... Now look.

&gt; Kaliningrad is Russian territory

[It was German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg) before the Russians **invaded** and took it. Built a military base there and declared it ""self-determinate"", just like in Crimea.

&gt; Transdenistra has not been invaded

The soldiers at the military base in Transnistria are Russian soldiers... They take orders from Russia and forcefully took control of the land from Moldova. Just like in Kaliningrad. Get your head out your arse jesus christ.

&gt; hell even Georgia is not under occupation is it?

I haven't said it was Kremlin bot.

&gt; Abkhazia and South Ossetia are now independent too

[They are part of Russia](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/11484030/Russia-signs-integration-deal-with-South-Ossetia.html) because Russia invaded and took them by force just like Transnistria Kaliningrad and now Crimea.

&gt; The BRICS are a joke? right ho then, only the most populous and resource rich regions of the planet then.

And yet a continent smaller than China by Land mass and population (Europe) has a higher GDP, better education, living standards, has greater international influence and is a financial capital of the world. 

The BRICS would only be relevant if they had some form of treaty or organisation that bound them together. Unfortunately they all hate each other and this will never happen. Keep dreaming Kremlin bot.

&gt; Btw how is the Eurozone

[Growing lol.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/13/eurozone-economy-grows-germany-powers-up)

&gt;  oh yeah they're in an economic depression with economy destroying structural deficits

Economic depression? The UK? What... The UK has been the fastest growing economy in the developed world for the last 1.5 years lol. How can you be so stupid and brainwashed?

&gt; Russia meanwhile still has a budget surplus.

Still an economy smaller than California's and a stock market worth less than Apple's.

You are cute.

&gt; More than likely I will be proven right,

I bet you said 2 years ago ""HURR DURR CRIMEA WILL NEVER BE INVADED!!""... because Kremlin bots like you believe whatever Putin says regardless of reality.

&gt; and fight the Russians you hate so much.

I'm not brainwashed enough to believe an entire country is Nazi's, unlike you.

I don't want to fight Russians, i want you Kremlin bots to wake up and realise your government is not good for you.

You on the other hand would happily kill all Ukrainians because you are a disgusting brain washed and blood thirsty savage.

I think there's a lot of drive to get women into male-dominated jobs, but without so much of the hard-graft.

&gt;How is the £35bn estimated? I guess also it depends on the technology (PON vs active ethernet) and who is doing it. BT has ducts and poles that no one else has, which would make it much cheaper.

If I remember correctly it was ""How much would it cost to replace all of the copper in Britain with Fibre?"", the cost at the time was ~£30 billion and has since risen to £35 billion. The reason was that BT had about £50 billion of raw physical copper in the ground at the time (Prices have since fallen) and could reprocess it all for a large profit *and* move to a full-fibre network.

I'm not sure if it was GPON or active ethernet but GPON again feels like a sticking plaster rather than what people actually need - especially when deployed at scale.

&gt;There's a sound reasoning for having one company own the network, though - having a crappy patchwork quilt of networks will take us closer to the US where you get one ISP and that's it.

I agree. I don't have a problem with the idea of Openreach, just it's private ownership given it's receipt of enormous fibre tax breaks.

&gt;Down here there's a shitload of totally unprofitable FTTP already. They've spent money running fibre to poles serving rural farmhouses in the middle of nowhere (but the farmhouse doesn't actually have the service), or poles that don't even have any copper users on them. Meanwhile, other people in Cornwall have been told to look at satellite internet. It's a total lottery and it's ridiculous. I've also seen streets where half of the street is on FTTP and the rest is on FTTC

I live in the suburbs of London (Zone 4) and I can only get 28/6 FTTC. It's not bad but it's not much to cheer about either. There is practically zero chance of the line speed improving much even with new copper-based technologies because the property is relatively far from it's green box.

&gt;I am doubtful that it would make any difference as far as surveillance goes. If the government wants a phone tap, they'll get it regardless of who you are with, and GCHQ probably has methods of internet surveillance that go far beyond tapping BT Wholesale's WBC network

It makes it a lot easier if it's one provider managing all the connections. Openreach is a fantastic conduit for this activity regardless of ownership. Tempura proved they're tapping most of the inter-continental connectivity too.

Companies like BT already get more capacity out of fibre they laid decades ago with no fuss by replacing the equipment at both ends but again without replacing the cable. And the quality of the cable you buy today is going to be a lot better than in the 80s or 90s.

Copper-based technology suffers from greater attenuation with distance - that's why the solutions so far have been to decrease the amount of copper in the loop through doing fibre to the cabinet. This was known from day one of the HFC era, and I suspect the pronouncements over futureproof coax happened before the Internet was a popular thing.

I disagree with that, as an employer of skilled people, I can tell you why I didn't open an office in Birmingham, we know we can get the skills in London.  Sure we might have to pay six figures, but we know there are many people with the skills we need there.

It's a case of chicken and egg, but having rapid transport links, even if it's just people living there because houses are cheaper will change that over time.  It will provide more money for the local economy, those people want to eat out, be entertained locally etc.  But also, if you've got a very short commute, it makes it easier for firms to open an office there, they know that people can commute worst case.

The doctor is basically useless and other services I am trying to access seem to be barely existing and hard to navigate if you don't already know of their existence, not to mention doing all that *whilst dealing with the effects of said anxiety and depression*!. Have some medication seems to be the only solution. I mean, If I wanted to end my life why would i put that in jeopardy and why would I want that on my medical record?

One of which was a semi chem, then a few years back some genius had the great idea to open a Gordons chemist directly opposite it, healthy competition.

I think all thats left in the main building is two chemists facing each other.

From a young age we're bombarded with all these Hollywood ideals; round the clock marketing and advertising constantly in our faces, filling our young minds with delusions de grandeur about lifestyles that are grossly out of touch with reality. Glamour and excitement at every turn.

And then you work hard at school but not that hard but still you make a half decent fist of it and do everything society recommends you should do to set yourself up reasonably well for the future; and then you grow up. And you're living in Basildon, working 30 hours a week as a security guard in Morrison's. You're making enough money to  get by, but not enough to really live, and you're bored as fuck. A completely saccharine life. Never in danger of starvation, nor worrying about a roof over your head. Yet everything exciting is  almost completely out of year reach, except maybe once a year you can go on a holiday. And none of this is any fault of your own, nor is anyone really to blame. It's just the boring reality of every day life.

And then someone offers you the chance to become a part of something. A part of a fight, or a struggle. The sort of excitement and meaning that belongs in a hollywood script. And you can channel your frustrations into this. You can blame your problems on this, or just use it as a scape goat, or a punching bag or whatever, but either way, you're actually now doing something with your life that is noteworthy.

Think about what you're saying here... you're comparing the Holocaust to LGBT rights. 

&gt; it appears that Asher's actually refused to make a cake that celebrated gay marriage because it goes against their moral viewpoint. To me, this seems perfectly acceptable

No. That's not acceptable. Because this is sexual bigotry and homophobia dressed up in the robes of religion. This doesn't make it acceptable. It does not make it moral.

People are entitled to their religious viewpoints and the hangups that come with it. But they are not entitled to discriminate based on their religious convictions. 

This is the 21st Century. 2015. **Religion does NOT get to trump basic human rights and equality.** 

The reason it is such a big deal here is because we have a significant amount of fundamentalist religious types and a very stubborn and just section of society that refuse to bow down to them. The people that asked for this cake probably knew full well what they were doing (or not), but they weren't wrong. In 10-15 years we will be appalled that we even questioned the notion of marriage equality because some people have a stone age belief that gay people are an abomination and undeserving of respect and equality.

You are the one that seems bent on derailing this conversation, what the fuck has Crimea got to do with the Falklands? As if you can take one instance anytime in history and make it applicable to any other slightly similar time.

You are the one being obtuse sir. Get your head out your arse.

&gt; Perhaps, in 1982, there might've existed circumstances that prompted American support for continued British sovereignty over the Falklands (I'm all for that by the way).

Perhaps? Its beyond reasonable fucking doubt. There is much information to back this up. You are the only person that seems to think just because you have a differing opinion but provide no evidence you are therefore correct.

You have no leg to stand on but continue to rant about fucking Crimea as if it's somehow relevant to the Falklands islands.

&gt; You may- or may not- have noticed that allot has changed in the course of the last 33 years, just as it has in the last 161 years since, in retaliation to Russian imperialism in Crimea, we blockaded Sebastopol.

No shit sherlock. What events exactly have had what effect on the US's foreign policy towards the UK?

All you've done is say ""Yeah but remember this one time when something slightly similar happened, its clearly exactly the same...""

&gt;  I don't see us doing that this time in just the same way as I don't see the Americans rushing to help if the Falklands were invaded again.

Did the Russian's have nukes in the 1800's? No.

Was Britain a super power in the 1800's? Yes.

Was Britain in competition with Russia for global domination during the 1800's? Yes.

You are incredibly incredibly dim if you think the situations are even slightly similar.

&gt; They've declared their neutrality

Just as they did during the beginning of the Falklands war. We all know how that ended up. (with American support for a British invasion).

&gt; and outright refused to recognise the residents right to self-determination. 

This is litterally the only peice of evidence you have to backup your claim.

They refuse to recognise self determination because they don't want a South American regional power being pissed off at them. I'm sorry if this is so hard to understand.

&gt; They cannot and will not be relied upon to provide material or diplomatic support.

I agree, they should not be relied upon for material or diplomatic support, but history has repeatedly shown they are willing to help Britain in tough situations.

You fail to see what the manager is asking him to do. At times he is not asked to be a defender. During the game he defends and attacks. He defends quite well when thats the position on the field he is ask to occupy. Mata refused to track back and defend most of the game. He didn't fit our system. This is why he is not here. At United he isn't asked to track back. As he shouldn't be because he isn't a type of player that should. That's why he is no longer in this system and was sold. You must first understand tactics. 

&gt;I remember saying the same exact thing about Mata on this sub when he was still with us, yet was vehemently downvoted. How can you expect the most creative and attack minded player on the team to also be defensively astute?

Oscar manages to track back and play defense also. Mata wasnt ask to do both at once. He was ask to attack and then play defense also. He was never asked to play offensively then on an immediate counter some how be on defense. He was ask to play defense when the opposing team was pressing. He obviously can't play defense if we got quick countered. He wasn't ask to to magically be in both positions.

Of course, infrastructure is *always* best - cycling in Berlin was infinitely preferable to Liverpool, with its common on-pavement cycle paths - but if there is none, or if it is on-road infrastructure, motorist mindset influences my ride *a lot*.

For example, in Berlin (with the exception of taxi drivers), most drivers gave me room, waited for a good moment to overtake and didn't hassle me.

In Liverpool, at least once, often two or three times in a journey of only a mile, cars will beep, squeeze past me at speed, overtake and cut me up (even just to wait in the traffic lights before me). Cars totally ignore bike boxes, often ignore cycle lanes, and just don't give a shit. I'm a fairly average rider (ie, not lycra clad, nor pavement riding), and I tend to hold the middle of the lane, moving over to the left when a car needs to pass, trying to be considerate - so I'm not doing anything to annoy drivers, except for maybe holding centre of lane *when it is dangerous not to*.

null,false,apinkknee,null,null,null,"&gt;  this sounds like more of a role for a 2 CB formation to me. Would he just drop into the back line? 

Yes and no, unfortunately. The main role there is to protect the dead-space between the midfield and the backline, and to remove the need for the central of the 3 CB's from stepping up to challenege a defender and effectively breaking the backline's shape. 
They can drop into and become the fourth under extreme pressue, but then you could argue at that point the Wing-backs should come deep enough to play the flank and allow the 3 CBs to condense.

A really good example of where a true holding mid would have been excellent is our game against Swansea with Siggy's goal. Siggy comes from the 10 spot and drifts wide. The CBs stayed together and drifted back to prepare for the cross. Siggy drifted into Rose, who was now drifting inward with the on-running winger. Bentaleb didn't stick with Siggy expecting Rose to pick him up. You know the rest. This happened with 5 men effectively back.     
This goal would have been murder in the 3 man setup if the holding midfielder doesn't track that loose player. 3 man CB's really, really need to stay cohesive and cover zones, not men. 

&gt;Why's that? If you have CBs prepared to contribute to the buildup, wouldn't that relieve some of the ball playing pressure (so to speak) from that midfielder?

Absolutely. They're prepared, and I'd say Vert and maybe Dier have enough technical know-how to play safe balls into the wide areas, but nothing has ever convinced Poch to allow Mason and Bentaleb to be relieved of those duties (distributing the ball). 

Consider that if you place responsibility on one of two CB's to distribute, you are telling the other team ""We are going to recycle balls all the way from the back when we reset, and if you catch us out there, we have no-one behind to break up counter."" -- Even with really technically sound CBs, you're more defensively sound by having a midfielder come deep to play maestro. 

The Chelsea-PSG 2nd leg was another beautiful demonstration of why holding midfields are so needed in many systems. Motta, even after his side went down to 10, removed all the threat from Oscar and Fabregas weaving in and out. He allowed his backline to stay together and protect pacy wingers. 

So, really, and I apologize for the lack of organization of this post (I've had no coffee), we're barely doing well defensively with 4 in the backline and a holding-eque midfielder. Moving to a 3 with wing backs draws us open to speedy wingers (see: Hazard, Sterling, Lennon, Willian) who can pull our 3-backs out of position. I really can't emphasize enough that you have to have positionally aware wing-backs and a holding mid for this to work, even if the CBs are technically sound to start possession over from deep.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;I've been feeling gradually worse about myself since my parents passed and my career failed. But it feels like a gamble, because the initial act of seeing a doc or a counsellor feels in itself a slight on my manliness and self-worth.

What is more manly than self improvement? You have a problem (Grieving and motivational issues). You know what tool you need to use to fix it (therapy). You know what you want the end result to be (to get better). You deserve to be happy again.

Phone up your GP and book an appointment. Or book an appointment with a counsellor if you already know of one.

I'll give my perspective; I frigging love therapy. I've had it twice for two separate reasons and honestly it is the best thing I have ever done for my own introspection and understanding. It took the things that weighed on me, gave them context, helped me understand them and let me rebuild my thoughts. You already have all the answers but therapy helps you put the pieces together. It gives you the tools to assemble better thoughts. Like flat-pack furniture it does take time but it is definitely worthwhile.

I still get overwhelmed and depressed but at the same time I'm more resilient. Resilience does not mean immune, it just means that you can weather the storm a bit better. Eventually the good days start outweighing the bad and things get better.

&gt;I worry it would tip me over the edge before it makes me feel better.

Medication is useful if you're feeling particularly low (Recommended if you want a kickstart). *Millions* of people in the UK are on anti depressants.

The whole formation of the attack is different providing you can shift the ball rapidly to Ivanovic, and the shape of your counter has to be slightly different to exploit Ivanovic's position.

- I believe [Conic Hill](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/conic-hill.shtml) has similar but better views than Duncryne Hill. Slightly harder though.

- I don't know if you're also taking a tent for some camping (you should!), but although wild camping is banned on east Loch Lomond shore, there is a very nice [informal campsite at Sallochy Bay](http://www.hol.co.uk/online-booking/uksaca/sallochy-campsite-rowardennan-glasgow).

null,false,ctni,null,null,null,"&gt; However..., there should be a (legal) way to refuse service when that service would be interpreted by the public as supporting a public cause - in this case, gay marriage.

There already is. You have a clearly stated 'terms of service' that says in unambiguous terms what services you will or will not provide, and direct all customers to read it prior to ordering. If Ashers had a clause saying ""We are a christian run company and may refuse service if asked to replicate images at odds with our christian beliefs, including but not limited to promotion of homosexual marriage [etc], and someone then came asking to have a pro-gay wedding cake made up, they could just point to the terms of service and say sorry. As long as they apply those same terms of service equally to everyone who asks for service, they'd likely be fine.

They could still be challenged in the courts, mind, if people felt that was still discriminatory. Which is one of the points of the courts - settling disputes, sorting what is fair, permissible or not.

The problem is that the person asking for the cake had no reason to believe that his request would be refused, and whatever way this was communicated to him led him to believe he was being discriminated against due to his sexual orientation. That may or may not be the case, but thats what the court case is meant to sort out, and it is his right to bring a court case if he feels discriminated against for whatever reason.

The 'conscience' clause is basically a cover for religious people to refuse service on a completely ad hoc basis to anyone/anything if it contravenes their 'religious beliefs', whatever they may be. More importantly, it means this is harder to challenge in the courts. It's an attempt to put religious belief/law above civil law. And thats what's dangerous. The same people who point to Sharia law in their anti-muslim rants are trying to do the same thing here.

We do not need legislation to allow business to refuse services for things that really are horrible things to ask for.

If someone wants to go to the Falls Road and ask for a tshirt of Lenny Murphy... Im sorry, but that just wouldn't happen and if it did the business would and should refuse. If the customer was upset with this they could take up legal proceedings and let a court decide if this was lawful. 

This is what happened with Ashers, the customer went to court and a court considered the refusal unlawful on the basis of equality. 

In the other example, the court would defend the shop on the basis that it was glorifying murder or something to that effect. 

Society has done well to avoid these things this far because people know better.

If you give up not only are you letting someone go who you think has committed a crime, you have also undermined the entire justice system. 

2) You've committed to arresting someone and for example they're on the floor and your trying to get cuffs on.

Coalition governments have been rare in British politics throughout its entire democratic history and there is a clear propensity for single-party government, so it cannot be argued that compromise is a feature inherent to the Westminster system either.

Many would even argue that the current government is a poor example of compromise, since the Liberal Democrats reneged on manifesto promises in order to form government, and so failed in their duty to represent their constituents (I have no stats to back up the ""many people"" claim other than the current low polling of the Liberal Democrats). What compromise there has been between the two parties has been good on the whole, but that's not to say the level of compromise is adequate. 

As far as I can tell, the SNP approach to Westminster is to be representative of their constituents  by not jumping into bed with a party whose policies do not represent the views of Scottish people, and to force compromise from any party seeking to push legislation through by not voting for it unless it is in the interests of the people who voted SNP. There is no requirement for the SNP to stand behind Ed Miliband, and that's the way I (as an English voter) think it should be.

But the real problem with Eurofighter is that we've known since 1990 that it's obsolete.  Eurofighter was designed to be the best fighter by being highly manoeuvrable being able to pull 9G constantly.  So that it could out manoeuvre enemy missiles.  Well when West Germany got hold of East Germany's MIG-29s  and AA-12s, they found that the AA-12 could pull 12G.  Brazil today sells AAMs that can pull 60Gs and so do other countries.  In response the Eurofighter was made more stealthy to roughly about half of a Tornado but the forward canards really show up on radar.  So whenever an enemy radar is detected the canards are moved to an angle minimising their surface in relation to the radar.  Making the aircraft less manoeuvrable then if it didn't have them.  Plus it's only in the last year with the introduction of a new lighter Helmet Mounted Cueing System (SPYDER?) that the aircraft can actually pull 9G before that it was limited to about 5.5G or the weight of the helmet would break the pilots neck.",null,0,null,1427290868,null,0,false,0,cpq6n5z,null,t3_3045mm,null,t1_cpq6n5z,null,t1_cpq54i6,null,null,null,1432003612,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Everyone's idea of morals are different, but there's a fine line between morals and bigotry. I could say that paedophilia or rape is morally wrong and most people would agree, but if I was to say hypothetically that a woman having a job is morally wrong, which was often believed not too long ago, there would be an uproar as although I hypothetically do not agree with it, this woman cannot help being a woman and should allowed to be treated like a human. 

If you apply the same hypothetical situation from before to the current situation about the bakery, and an individual was refused service as they wanted a cake celebrating a woman getting a job, would that be acceptable? Probably not, as that would be classed as bigotry, even though it's against my hypothetical moral beliefs. 

In the current real situation, would it be classed as 'moral beliefs' as it's believed by a few individuals, or would it be classed as bigotry as it's violating many individuals basic human rights. I believe it's the latter, not just because I'm a gay man getting married next month, but because all humans should be treated with the same level of respect, no matter their situation, race, religion or sex. 

As for the clause being put through stormont, it is just disgusting and is against and basic level if human rights that should be received by any human. If the bill is passed, I for one will not be returning home. 

There's currently a petition against the bill, and I hope it's not rude of me to ask any one who see's this post to sign, and any one who does, thank you.

null,false,Rofosrofos,null,null,null,"It's been confirmed. Here is the full statement from Lord Hall.

&gt;""On 9 March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson reported to BBC management that he had been involved in a physical and verbal incident with Oisin Tymon, the producer of Top Gear, at the Simonstone Hall Hotel, North Yorkshire, whilst working on location. The incident had occurred on 4 March 2015 and Jeremy Clarkson was suspended on 10 March, pending investigation.

&gt;I was asked to undertake an investigation to establish the facts of what occurred. In conducting my investigation, in line with the BBC’s usual practice, I interviewed a number of witnesses and others connected with the incident. Accounts were agreed, based on my interviews, with each participant.

&gt;Having conducted these interviews and considered the evidence presented, I conclude the following: on 4 March 2015 Oisin Tymon was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson. During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period, both at the time of the physical attack and subsequently.

 
&gt;Specific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows:

&gt;* Earlier on 4 March, studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presenters had travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire
&gt;* the incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall Hotel, where Oisin Tymon was working on location for Top Gear
&gt;* The physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness;
&gt;* It is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation;
&gt;* The verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion – both during the attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting was audible in a hotel bedroom
 derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a sustained period of time;
&gt;* It is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he had lost his job
 following the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for examination;
 over the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin Tymon by way of text, email and in person; and
&gt;* It is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.

&gt;It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected. He has suffered significant personal distress as a result of this incident, through no fault of his own.""

&gt;""It is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract.  It is not a decision I have taken lightly.  I have done so only after a very careful consideration of the facts and after personally meeting both Jeremy and Oisin Tymon.

&gt;""I am grateful to Ken MacQuarrie for the thorough way he has conducted an investigation of the incident on 4 March.  Given the obvious and very genuine public interest in this I am publishing the findings of his report.  I take no pleasure in doing so.  I am only making them public so people can better understand the background.  I know how popular the programme is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion.  The main facts are not disputed by those involved.

&gt;""I want to make three points.

&gt;""**First** – The BBC is a broad church. Our strength in many ways lies in that diversity. We need distinctive and different voices but they cannot come at any price.  Common to all at the BBC have to be standards of decency and respect.  I cannot condone what has happened on this occasion.  A member of staff – who is a completely innocent party – took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature.  For me a line has been crossed.  There cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another dictated by either rank, or public relations and commercial considerations.

&gt;""**Second** – This has obviously been difficult for everyone involved but in particular for Oisin.  I want to make clear that no blame attaches to him for this incident.  He has behaved with huge integrity throughout.  As a senior producer at the BBC he will continue to have an important role within the organisation in the future.

&gt;""**Third** – Obviously none of us wanted to find ourselves in this position.  This decision should in no way detract from the extraordinary contribution that Jeremy Clarkson has made to the BBC.  I have always personally been a great fan of his work and Top Gear.  Jeremy is a huge talent.  He may be leaving the BBC but I am sure he will continue to entertain, challenge and amuse audiences for many years to come.

&gt;""The BBC must now look to renew Top Gear for 2016.  This will be a big challenge and there is no point in pretending otherwise.  I have asked Kim Shillinglaw to look at how best we might take this forward over the coming months.  I have also asked her to look at how we put out the last programmes in the current series.""",null,0,null,1427292910,null,0,false,0,cpq7nyu,null,t3_306mz1,null,t1_cpq7nyu,null,t3_306mz1,null,null,null,1432005026,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;""On 9 March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson reported to BBC management that he had been involved in a physical and verbal incident with Oisin Tymon, the producer of Top Gear, at the Simonstone Hall Hotel, North Yorkshire, whilst working on location. The incident had occurred on 4 March 2015 and Jeremy Clarkson was suspended on 10 March, pending investigation.

&gt;I was asked to undertake an investigation to establish the facts of what occurred. In conducting my investigation, in line with the BBC’s usual practice, I interviewed a number of witnesses and others connected with the incident. Accounts were agreed, based on my interviews, with each participant.

&gt;Having conducted these interviews and considered the evidence presented, I conclude the following: on 4 March 2015 Oisin Tymon was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson. During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period, both at the time of the physical attack and subsequently.

 
&gt;Specific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows:

&gt;* Earlier on 4 March, studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presenters had travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire
&gt;* the incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall Hotel, where Oisin Tymon was working on location for Top Gear
&gt;* The physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness;
&gt;* It is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation;
&gt;* The verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion – both during the attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting was audible in a hotel bedroom
 derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a sustained period of time;
&gt;* It is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he had lost his job
 following the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for examination;
 over the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin Tymon by way of text, email and in person; and
&gt;* It is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.

&gt;It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected. He has suffered significant personal distress as a result of this incident, through no fault of his own.""

&gt;""It is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract.  It is not a decision I have taken lightly.  I have done so only after a very careful consideration of the facts and after personally meeting both Jeremy and Oisin Tymon.

&gt;""I am grateful to Ken MacQuarrie for the thorough way he has conducted an investigation of the incident on 4 March.  Given the obvious and very genuine public interest in this I am publishing the findings of his report.  I take no pleasure in doing so.  I am only making them public so people can better understand the background.  I know how popular the programme is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion.  The main facts are not disputed by those involved.

&gt;""I want to make three points.

&gt;""**First** – The BBC is a broad church. Our strength in many ways lies in that diversity. We need distinctive and different voices but they cannot come at any price.  Common to all at the BBC have to be standards of decency and respect.  I cannot condone what has happened on this occasion.  A member of staff – who is a completely innocent party – took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature.  For me a line has been crossed.  There cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another dictated by either rank, or public relations and commercial considerations.

&gt;""**Second** – This has obviously been difficult for everyone involved but in particular for Oisin.  I want to make clear that no blame attaches to him for this incident.  He has behaved with huge integrity throughout.  As a senior producer at the BBC he will continue to have an important role within the organisation in the future.

&gt;""**Third** – Obviously none of us wanted to find ourselves in this position.  This decision should in no way detract from the extraordinary contribution that Jeremy Clarkson has made to the BBC.  I have always personally been a great fan of his work and Top Gear.  Jeremy is a huge talent.  He may be leaving the BBC but I am sure he will continue to entertain, challenge and amuse audiences for many years to come.

&gt;""The BBC must now look to renew Top Gear for 2016.  This will be a big challenge and there is no point in pretending otherwise.

The evidence says otherwise.

&gt; Have you heard of World war 2? to the victor go the spoils child and that is something you will have to learn to accept.

[Even though Russia agreed not to take any land after world war 2.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference)

*The Big Three further agreed that democracies would be established, all liberated European and former Axis satellite countries would hold free elections and that order would be restored. In that regard, they promised to rebuild occupied countries by processes that will allow them ""to create democratic institutions of their own choice.*

*The Big Three would assist occupied countries to form interim governments that* **""pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of the Governments responsive to the will of the people""** *and to ""facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections.""*

Kremlin bots like you never fail to amuse me with your entitlement and victim complex.

&gt; Abkhazia and South Ossetia SIGNED an integration deal after they won their independence from the tie eating deranged lunatic Saakashvili you no doubt think is some paragon of leadership.

I don't care about Saakashvili. All i care about are the people that Russia killed and murdered in order to grab more land. Of course a blood thirsty brain washed savage like yourself would only say the people Russia kills deserve it because the Kremlin tells you its ok to kill people. You really are disgusting you know.

&gt;  Oh dear looks like your squirming lies are falling apart now with your HUUR DURR RUSSIANS ARE LITERALy HITLER, HERE COMES WW3 moronic tirade.

Please quote me where i have said ""Russians are Hitler"". I dislike your government Kremlin bot, not you. You are the savage that calls for the death of all Ukrainians, I wish for Putin and his cronies to be deposed, that is all.

The double think from you is hilarious. ""It's ok to say all Ukrainians must die because The Kremlin told me so. But you cannot say all Russians must die because The Kremlin told me so.""

Are you brain damaged or 12 or what?

&gt; The UK economy is in dire straits, GDP is an awful measure of progress, per capita it is way down on 2008

So by your own admission. Britain is more than twice as rich than Russia. Even though Russia is the largest country on the planet with the most natural resources at its disposal.

Keep bleeting Kremlin bot.

&gt; Though I suspect you know less of economics than you do of geopolitics, thats what happens when kiddies like you read fucking vice and Reddit all day going along for the great circle jerk. 

Yeah, reading Russian state owned media is so much better.

At least the media outlets i do use (not vice or reddit lol) are verifiably independent and not some government mouth piece. You might as well be a shill for all i care.

&gt; Russia has a budget surplus and has only fallen on recent hard times due to sanctions but more importantly the collapse in value of crude oil.

And do you know why Russia is so badly effected by this? Because it has one of the least diverse economies on the planet. Its a country that relies almost entirely on Gas, Oil and commodities. Russia whores itself.

Meanwhile the rest of the world continues to diversify and leave Russia further behind.

&gt; 2 years ago I actually did think Crimea would be annexed as it was quite obvious to me that the Russians would never abandon their only warm water port and strategic base of their black sea fleet, it has been under their control since the days of the Russian empire for fucks sake you blithering idiot.

[More historical revisionism huh Kremlin bot?)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War)

&gt; I am quite sanguine about the Russians and their attitudes towards their neighboring countries, they will only kill those foolish enough to upset the balance of power in Russias near abroad.

Of course you are sanguine, you eat up all the state propaganda they spew out and have fallen into Putin's personallity cult. I bet to you Putin is some sort of demi-god, perhaps reminiscent of North Korea's ""Dear Leader""?

You know there is a reason all the previously occupied countries in Europe dislike Russia. Its because they brain wash their population into sheeps like yourself which will allows Russia to repeatedly invade kill take and destroy any country they desire. Because the population is brain washed into thinking killing and taking land is acceptable.

Absolutely disgusting.

&gt; That is something you will have to learn for yourself though and then maybe you can stop wasting your time with your pathetic mewling and half truths.

I've already learnt that you are a Kremlin bot, perhaps even a shill; and the Russian government will stop at nothing to take more land.

**Investigation findings – Ken MacQuarrie (Director BBC Scotland)**

On 9 March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson reported to BBC management that he had been involved in a
physical and verbal incident with Oisin Tymon, the producer of Top Gear, at the Simonstone Hall
Hotel, North Yorkshire, whilst working on location. The incident had occurred on 4 March 2015
and Jeremy Clarkson was suspended on 10 March, pending investigation.

I was asked to undertake an investigation to establish the facts of what occurred. In conducting my
investigation, in line with the BBC’s usual practice, I interviewed a number of witnesses and others
connected with the incident. Accounts were agreed, based on my interviews, with each participant.

Having conducted these interviews and considered the evidence presented, I conclude the
following: on 4 March 2015 Oisin Tymon was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack
by Jeremy Clarkson. During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and
bleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period, both at the time of the
physical attack and subsequently.

Specific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows:

* earlier on 4 March, studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presenters had travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire;

* the incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall Hotel, where Oisin Tymon was
working on location for Top Gear;
* the physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness;
* it is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation;
* the verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion – both during the
attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to
sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting
was audible in a hotel bedroom;
* derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear
team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a
sustained period of time;
* it is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he
had lost his job;
* following the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for
examination;
* over the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin
Tymon by way of text, email and in person; and
* it is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.

It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an
unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important
creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected. He has suffered significant
personal distress as a result of this incident, through no fault of his own.",null,0,null,1427293647,null,0,false,0,cpq82te,null,t3_3093qx,null,t1_cpq82te,null,t3_3093qx,null,null,null,1432005221,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Henry for Sandro was a decent enough defensive change.  At the time we needed a goal, yes, but we also needed to avoid conceding another goal.  Who else do we have in midfield who would have tracked back for us?  Sandro was not playing at his best either.

So ELI5:

(1) The value of money is **not** constant. In my view probably the two most important things affecting player transfers are (a) inflation (b) revenue of clubs. These things define what make a good/bad deal - bargain over priced.

(2) To help you understand the point I was making I gave you data points (a) Rooney (18) in 2004 at £26m (b) Bale (18) in 2007 at £10m (c) Henderson (20) at £20m - Rooney as a striker costs more and Bale as a defender is cheapest but the point is at different points in history the price of young **talent** costs differing amounts and the **historic trend is upwards**.

(3) If you look at something like [this](http://www.moneysorter.co.uk/calculator_inflation2.html) and just adjust the money for inflation - the £25m that Rooney paid for in 2004 is a perfect match for the £26.7m. I know you're dying to say - ""well he's not a Rooney"" but that is, with the benefit of 10yrs of hindsight. When the investment was made it was on the basis of the talent shown to date.

(4) If you look at something like [this](http://swissramble.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/the-premier-league-tv-deal-master-and.html) see the first chart. Between 2004 when the Rooney deal had concluded and 2013 when the Lamela deal had concluded TV revenues had increased by in excess of 100%.

So making my point as simply as possible - If you are investing in talent at about 2004 prices when your income has increased by over 100% - i.e. you have double the money in your pocket you are getting astonishing value.

Lots of people have written here - he's probably worth half what we paid for him - who says? He's hasn't been sold yet. This is what makes your Andy caroll example funny. He was bought in 2011 for £30 million, loaned in 2012 for £2m and sold at the end of the season for £15m in less than a year they realised all of the loss.

If next season Lamela shows the same progression he has displayed this season (4 gls and 5 assts to date) at 24 who is to say we couldn't realise close to if not all of the money outlay on him. If he has a breakout season we'll be looking for 2x. That is why he's a bargain - there is simply so much time for us to recoup our investment and **importantly** he has already shown he has talent, and is showing (fleetingly) that he might be able to replicate that talent in the EPL.",null,0,null,1427293988,null,0,false,0,cpq89we,null,t3_302pu7,null,t1_cpq89we,null,t1_cpq6de8,null,null,null,1432005314,null,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0,null

Investigation findings – Ken MacQuarrie
On 9 March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson reported to BBC management that he had been involved in a
physical and verbal incident with Oisin Tymon, the producer of Top Gear, at the Simonstone Hall
Hotel, North Yorkshire, whilst working on location. The incident had occurred on 4 March 2015
and Jeremy Clarkson was suspended on 10 March, pending investigation.
I was asked to undertake an investigation to establish the facts of what occurred. In conducting my
investigation, in line with the BBC’s usual practice, I interviewed a number of witnesses and others
connected with the incident. Accounts were agreed, based on my interviews, with each participant.
Having conducted these interviews and considered the evidence presented, I conclude the
following: on 4 March 2015 Oisin Tymon was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack
by Jeremy Clarkson. During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and
bleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period, both at the time of the
physical attack and subsequently.
Specific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows:

*  earlier on 4 March, studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presenters
had travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire;

* the incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall Hotel, where Oisin Tymon was
working on location for Top Gear;

* the physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness;

* it is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation;

* the verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion – both during the
attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to
sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting
was audible in a hotel bedroom;

* derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear
team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a
sustained period of time;

* it is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he
had lost his job;

* following the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for
examination;

* over the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin
Tymon by way of text, email and in person; and

* it is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.
It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an
unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important
creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected. He has suffered significant
personal distress as a result of this incident, through no fault of his own.",null,0,null,1427294062,null,0,1427294266,0,cpq8bdl,null,t3_3093qx,null,t1_cpq8bdl,null,t1_cpq7rlm,null,null,null,1432005333,null,93,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,93,null

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;You're saying some incredibly ignorant things. First of all you might want to stop saying 'trannies' as it is a slur towards transgendered individuals.

Right.  You can't articulate an actual reason, so you're reduced to calling differences in opinion 'ignorant' or saying that a word is a 'slur'.  But these aren't actual reasons.  They're just *your* claim to what's offensive.  

&gt;That's pretty much the basis of most civil rights/social movements.

No it's not.  Martin Luther King didn't give speeches about being offended and how we need to police each other's language.  For that matter, gay marriage advocates didn't just use the 'offense' gambit.  They gave *reasons*.  They were able to articulate actual arguments that stood up and made sense.

&gt;LGBT activism has existed for literally decades, and all they ask is to be respected when it comes to their biological nature, and in doing so they can live happy and fulfilling lives.

It's a biological thing for a guy to put on a dress and ask to be called a woman?  Well perhaps.  And perhaps not.  These are issues which are open to question and are still under active debate.  Don't forget - it's the gender activists who often claim that sexual orientation are just sociological constructs.

Freelancing - as you have mentioned elsewhere you may set up a LTD company - probably a good idea. Key again is to find an accountant to do it for not too much money.

Yet here, when an organisation attempts to make some adjustment, albeit a seemingly strange one, to make the conference more bearable for people with anxiety they are mocked relentlessly for it.

&gt; However, the measure quickly proved to be a failure in achieving its objectives and become unpopular: as in the 1967–1976 period, on winter mornings, the sun was still rising at 9:00, and people went to work in the dark. Obviously, children also began the school day in darkness, with repercussions on their standards of learning, school performance and sleep habits. It was even common that children fall asleep on the early morning classes. 
On summer evenings, the usage of CET and CEST was revealed to have a disturbing effect on people’s sleep habits, particularly children's, as the sun was still setting at 22:00 or 22:30, so the sky was only completely dark towards midnight and sometimes, only at 1:00. A company hired by European Commission conducted a study which concluded that, in fact, there were no energy savings because in the early morning, due to the dark, workers turned on lights in their offices, and they forgot to turn them off, leaving them switched on for the rest of the morning, which increased energy consumption. 
Concerns also emerged concerns about the effect of the coincidence of rush hours with the hottest hours of the day on air pollution.

We abolished council tax and business rates and replaced them with a Land Value Tax, which is a much more progressive and fair way of taxing land. LVT is levied on the unimproved value of land only, meaning that productive use of land is encouraged and development is not penalised.

We also tied the personal allowance with the minimum wage, meaning that people working at the minimum wage (and is reviewed if the minimum wage increases) for 40 hours a week pay no income tax.

Broad church means that we do not have one specific ideology in our party, but instead have a range of similar views. 

We are for the most part economically centrist, with some ""centre-left"" and some ""centre-right"" members, we ultimately believe in building a stronger and fairer economy, which gives everyone opportunity.

Exept that it *is* a slur, which has been used to put down and harras trans individuals. You're more than free to use such a term as much as you like, just like you are more than welcome to reffer to black people as niggers, or gays as poofs, but don't be suprised when people call you a twat and insensitive for doing so; the same rings true for the word 'tranny' as well. 

&gt; No it's not. Martin Luther King didn't give speeches about being offended and how we need to police each other's language. 

This is unbelievably ignorant; you clearly lack any knowledge when it comes to this historical matter. Civil rights activists spoke a great deal about reducing the use of racial slurs such as 'nigger' and 'boy', and how such terms were offensive and demeaning to the black community. Thankfully as society progressed, we realised that using such terms to describe people is hurtful and unnecessary and thankfully such words fell out of favour and were only reserved for the use of small-minded bigots. 

&gt;It's a biological thing for a guy to put on a dress and ask to be called a woman? Well perhaps. And perhaps not. These are issues which are open to question and are still under active debate.

Such debates have been settled already by the scientific community, gender disphoria is a recognised medical phenomenon. your unwillingness to accept such facts simply means you are ignorant. Claiming that there is a debate as to whether gender disphoria exists, is just as ignorant as claiming that we are still debating whether homosexuality is a choice.

It's to hold your hands up and sort him out. This didn't happen. Holding an argument with drunk for 20 minutes is possibly going to tip him over and it did. 

I'm not defending jeremy here but you did ask what possible reason there could have been and I surmised this.

His staunch support later earned him a British Knighthood. He provided the United Kingdom with all the equipment she required during the war. Ranging from submarine detectors to the latest missiles. All this was done very discreetly. His actions led to divisions amongst Reagan’s staff. Whilst Weinberger claimed that he has received authorisation from Ronald Reagan to provide covert support to the UK, others disagreed. Admiral Dennis Blair was asked by Snow if he was aware of the Reagan’s consent. He said ‘no’ and that there were too many secrets in the administration. Alexander Haig who was charged with mediating the dispute between Britain and Argentina also stated that he did not believe that Reagan authorised the covert supply of weapons. This, he said, was due to Reagan’s administration being a ‘loose ship’ with a ‘flawed system’ of conducting policy. When Snow asked Haig if he thought Reagan was responsible for the flawed system, he responded by stating that it was not Reagan’s fault but the fault of his staff.

Consistently people have been begging for him to be sacked, but why? Because he made a comment that upset you? How about the legion of other TV presenters, comedians, writers etc etc who have made similar comments?

Let me get something straight: I am not defending Clarkson for what he did. He shouldn't have done it. But it seems everyone is happy that he's gone, even if they never watched Top Gear. Imagine if someone wanted something you loved to be cancelled? How would you feel? How would you feel if you asked them if they even watched it, and they said no? Be a bit annoying, wouldn't it?

Let's take another example. I do not enjoy The Voice. Do I want The Voice to be cancelled? Not particularly. The reason being is that there are people out there that enjoy it. And don't give the stupid ""I pay a licensing fee"" excuse, because it's pretty difficult for the BBC to create things that every single person enjoys. And let's be honest, The Voice has a ton of viewers. My point is is that just because I don't enjoy something, does not mean I don't want it to be stopped.

Again, and I know people will constantly overlook this point, I am not defending Jeremy Clarkson. I'm simply saying that it's a bit ridiculous for someone to want something to be cancelled simply because they don't like it.

My current goal is to do game development but, the way things have gone, something vocational would be perfect. I've always found physical exercise to be the best way to combat depression, anything that gets the endorphins going. So I looked into labouring jobs but found I would need a card of some sort, that I would have to pay for, to say I could work in hazardous environments (I think that's what it's for anyway). I don't really have the money to spend on it at the moment but possibly in the future. 

I ought to go the gym, I can imagine it would benefit me greatly. It's just pushing myself to go that first time that is proving hard for some reason. Is it that bad? When I think of going I feel absolutely terrified, I don't know why.

The initial effect of this drug was a nausea for me but it went away in a week or so. There are different drugs though, hopefully your GP would consider your feelings on the matter though and not put you on one of the more doping drugs. 

 But I also went through psychotherapy, I went through a local NHS scheme, but I am not sure what would be available to you. I was lucky because I had a support net and was pushed towards the help. But I know how hard it can be to bring yourself to do anything. 

I actually volunteer at a citizens advice bureau at the moment, which helps a lot with keeping my mind off of the depression. And also has gotten me a few interviews. Their GA course is free and my local CAB does advocacy which helps people with health problems. I have actually sat down with a few clients and gone through the mental health self referal packs because in a lot of cases people cannot bring themselves to do it.

So? Some men being denied something all women were denied doesnt invalidate the idea society was patriarchal. Men having it shit too doesn't stop society from being patriarchal either. It doesn't change the fact men dominated everything from the sciences to government to literature and for long periods of history worked to prevent women from entering those spheres. Besides that society wasn't only patriarchal at the top, it was patriarchal on all levels: married women of any class couldn't legally own property until just over 100 years ago because her property was considered the property of her husband.

The yes campaign during the referendum centred around fairness and equality and the chance to challenge the out dated Westminster establishment. It was about creating something that actually represents the views of the people and to break away from the 2.5 party system that has caused a massive disengagement with politics.


These are all things that many in the whole of the United Kingdom would definitely support,  that's why Nicola Sturgeon keeps talking about progressive alliances with parties like Plaid Cymru and the Greens, to actually be in a position to push forward progressive policies with a genuine mandate across the whole of the UK. There's probably a lot of common ground with traditional labour voters here, if they are willing to see past the SNP bogey man that seems to being pedalled at the moment.

It doesn't list in any real detail what was said or by whom - which is odd considering it also states that verbal abuse went on for a lot longer, but doesn't give any specifics outside of sacking threats...if I had two colleagues that had a shouting match that went on for twenty minutes, followed by one of them punching the other, then *further* shouting (that could be heard all over the hotel, by this summary), I'd want to know what they were shouting about to get a context (and would now be wondering why, if everyone interviewed agreed on the series of events, the details are so light).

If someone genuinely suffers anxiety from clapping, that is a problem that needs to be addressed as they simply won't be able to cope in situations that occur in everyday life. 

The way the mental health system needs to change is to provide better support so that the people with anxiety issues are able to manage the stress when these triggering issues occur.

I have a fear of public speaking, I realised that the way to deal with that isn't to just avoid all opportunities of public speaking (I literally won't be able to complete my PhD if I do that), but rather to receive coaching to help me manage to anxiety when I get behind the podium.

EDIT: I am glad that they are being sensitive to mental health issues, but ffs these kind of measures are simply making the problem worse, not better. You're encouraging people to accept not getting treatment for the problem.

I'm always going to ask questions when stuff appears glossed over. Which this does.

&gt;The investigation says it was an unprovoked attack and that Clarkson isn't challenging that.

Correct - which then prompts even more questions seeing as it's so light on specifics, especially when the other presenters are making a point of not commenting.

&gt;The man did something incredibly stupid while drunk and this poor chap got hurt.

Which despite the entire crew and most of the hotel hearing the row, we don't know any specifics about. What was all the shouting about? Why that *specific* producer? Why didn't he go to A&amp;E straight away, opting to endure more verbal abuse for a lot longer afterwards?

&gt;It's just a bad situation all around.

Agreed - I'm not a Clarkson fan, don't read his column or books, and don't regularly watch Top Gear; if he goes (and it appears he has), it doesn't really make any difference to me - but this is one of those incidents that screams key-facts-missing.

null,false,threejoinedrings,null,null,null,"&gt;So what would happen if I, as a white male heterosexual atheist, wanted to buy a cake for my brother's gay wedding? Could they discriminate against me? Would it make a difference if I said I was a Christian?

The Conscience Clause would allow any private service-provider to refuse that service if they felt it was promoting beliefs they didn't agree with - if your brother's gay wedding cake had two men kissing on it or two clearly male names on it, or something similar, they could absolutely refuse to provide it, regardless of who is actually paying for it. They can *only* apply the conscience clause to services affected by the Sexual Orientation equalities act (so people in or who want same-gender relationships of any kind), not to other religions or other protected groups - the customer's religious beliefs don't matter, even if they are the same.

With a cake, it's not such a big deal. *However*, Northern Ireland's equality law also covers things like access to accommodation and education. With a conscience clause it would be legal for private landlords to refuse to rent to same-gender couples because that could be argued as directly endorsing their choice to live together (especially if the property only had one bedroom). So it's not so much the cake decision that's a big deal, it's the extra things that come into it. It could also mean that hotels and other places could refuse to let same-gender couples stay together in a room (or just refuse to let them stay as a couple at all), and other things like that. It could result in an increase in homelessness among LGB people, and a lot of other difficulties in terms of them accessing things they need, as it attacks anything that could be seen as ""supporting"" their sexuality or relationships - that can be a lot of things.

Employment is protected by EU law, which NI can't change directly, but just about everything else to do with equalities could be affected by this. So a gay/bisexual person could be employed in a hotel that they couldn't actually stay in with their partner, for example.

**Edit:** I think it's particularly poignant that this does only apply to sexual orientation, and they haven't proposed it for any other equalities acts. Not that I would want it to apply to anyone else either (where applied to gender, it might allow landlords to refuse accommodation to unmarried pregnant women or mothers, for example, since that would be ""supporting"" their ""sinful lifestyle"", similar with unmarried couples in hotels, or even unmarried women with children asking for support in education), but the fact that it doesn't apply to any other groups shows that it is specifically against LGBT+ people, and not just to protect religious ideas. If it were to protect religious ideas, it would include being able to discriminate against women as well, and probably a lot of other groups. Also, it would allow Muslim/Jewish/anything else businesses to discriminate in the same ways according to their religious beliefs.",null,0,null,1427300231,null,0,1427300705,0,cpqc6b4,null,t3_308le4,null,t1_cpqc6b4,null,t1_cpq4nev,null,null,null,1432007151,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

null,false,534e47,,Belfast,null," I lived in England for three years. Before moving away I hated this place. I thought it was backward, bitter place, which had nothing to provide except an excuse to leave. Initially I didn’t want to move back, but ended up getting my Masters degree here, and I'm enjoying it much more than when I was younger. Having lived in England, I now feel very comfortable to call myself Irish, and feel as though I live in an Irish city, but with all the benefits that come from being within the UK. This is very different from how I felt before I left, where I was told told I was British. I was able to see how other nations in the UK celebrate their differences, without it being seen as a threat. While this sounds so silly now, it was a big thing at the time, because to call myself Irish from the area I grew up was to be seen as different.

 What I have really noticed is how strict the laws on drinking and gambling are here. In England I didn't drink much, but if I went out it would be about 23:00 and I would level about 04:00, usually stopping at a normal corner shop to buy a few beers to have at the house with the mates after. I can understand the arguments against 24-hour drinking laws, but it has really ruined my causal, only drink a few over a long period of time outlook.

 Also noticed that we have a terrible public transport system, England is decades ahead of us, and mainland Europe transport isn't something we could even dream of yet. This is really annoying as if I don't want to pay £10 in a taxi home I have to get the last bus at 22:45!!

 The fact the all taxis at night are private hire is ridiculous. I am aware there has been a bill/act/law to change this, but last thing I heard, it was postponed.

 Finally in England I enjoyed going to the casino once a month to play poker, I wasn't half bad either. I'm just really annoyed that a resent proposal to build a casino was turned down [link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29228056), I don't believe the threat of possible addiction in a small percentage should hinder the desires of others. There is currently nothing stopping someone logging onto poker stars and blowing all their earnings, so why restrict this game to computer screens, where the addiction is never witnessed.

Sorry for the long rant, but from living away I have confirmed the realisation, that this would be a much better place if people were a little more open-minded.

attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to
sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting
was audible in a hotel bedroom;

&gt; derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear
team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a

had lost his job;

There's nothing better than waking up to see a beautiful sunrise over a Scottish loch. It's also cheap and grants great flexibility. There's drawbacks ofcourse, you're carrying more gear/food and it's harder to escape midges and/or bad weather. May and June are among the better months but you can never trust the weather in Scotland.

- For (wild)camping in Glen Coe you can camp right besides the [Kings House Hotel](http://www.kingshousehotel.co.uk) and eat/drink/share stories in their climbers bar. Staying in Kings House might be even better but I think it's very hard to get a room.

- If you're still thinking about doing something around Fort William there is the [Glen Nevis Campsite](http://www.glen-nevis.co.uk) a couple of miles south of Fort William. It's close to the starting point for the walk up [Ben Nevis](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/bennevis.shtml), highest mountain in Britain. Quite touristy but if the weather permits the views are amazing.
