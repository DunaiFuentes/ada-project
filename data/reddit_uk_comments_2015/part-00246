null,false,OG_Panda,null,null,null,"I view our situation as one where we have not just one weakness, but have mutliple weaknesses at the moment (rb, st, leaders in the locker room, etc). Having so many weakness leaves us with three options. We either promote academy players, we stay the course and hope the personal that we have can be enough to remedy these weaknesses without adding anyone new or we go out and buy players to solve these weaknesses. Each have their own pros and cons. Academy players will be cheaper, hungrier, and more daring (think Sterling and Ibe when they debuted) The problem will be the level of experience and skill that they possess coming out the gates. The perfect example is Sinclair. He has huge potential and hunger, but lacks the skill to really be a threat at the level we're playing at this very moment. The next is keeping the course, but we just have to look at last season to see how that will most likely work out. We could get lucky and the personal we have right now could kick off and become a force, but that is highly likely. The safest route in my opinion is the one we're on right now, buying players to offset our weaknesses. The con to this, though, is the possibility of ""doing a Tottenham"". We could have a large influx of players meant to correct weaknesses, but instead they may never really gel and we have a repeat of under performing players. I believe that the guys in charge have realized this and that's why they are striving so hard to sign players early so they can have as much time as possible to train before the season begins. This way they can establish the best system to get the most out of the new faces. The risk of ""doing a Tottenham"" is always going to be there. Not signing new players in hopes of avoiding that risk will be an ever greater risk and a mistake in my opinion. We're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. There is the argument that we should go after more proven talent if we really want to correct our weaknesses, but, and I'm sure yall are tired of reading this, the club has to look who is reasonably available, but that is a whole other argument. 

**TL:DR** We're stuck between a rock and hard place. We need more players and it is safer gamble to possibly pull a Tottenham then to not sign anyone and start the season exactly where we left all in the last one.

however if some other club is going to buy him, then we should get him right away, another issue is the club he's playing for, in Danish football Copenhagen is known as a club whit a lot of money, and this year they broke there transfer record to heighten the strength if the team, for them to sell him already at this time, its gonna take a lot of persuasion and cash.

""worker"" status is not a loophole, and zero hour contracts *do not mean you are a worker*. If you treat someone like an employee, then they're an employee no matter what your contract says.

He's never going to be great defensively, but at Swansea he often showed he is an intelligent reader of the game (something I would argue Mason isn't yet), so with consistent coaching, I don't see why he couldn't be adequate defensively.

That said, I doubt he'll feature for us much now, unless his preseason goes well. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Swansea pick him up for around £6m-£8m, as he's only just 23 after all, and Monk seemed to feel he had a part to play.

But at this point, it feels like everything that could be said about him has been said so I'm just waiting to see what happens instead.

Anyway, a 4-2-3-1 could work nicely assuming we have actual fullbacks - I think Clyne could be great in that formation. A double pivot in Lucas - Henderson (Can, Allen) with an offensive but pressing three in Coutinho - Firmino - Lallana (Markovic, Ibe, Origi) and then a lone attacker in Benteke (Sturridge, Ings).

null,false,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,null,"Since terrorism is the act of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims, the greater attention you can draw to it (and more importantly the more people you can scare) the more power an act can have. The more scared people are, the bigger the enemy seems. And the media is nothing but a microscope pointing at a tiny section of the actions in the world, so small actions get magnified.

The actual death toll, while shocking, is quite low. Huge atrocities are carried out continuously around the world but because they fall into a pattern they're not ""new"". Roughly the same number of people die in road accidents in the UK every week. The UK has roughly the same number of alcohol related deaths *every day*.

Nearly twelve thousand children have died in the Syrian civil war.

To see this in a slightly different way, the death toll rose from 15 to 30, something like that. Did the act become twice as scary? Did it become scarier *at all*? I don't think so. It's a number of people larger than a small group (so we aren't picturing it like one family or a minivan of mates) and it's a small enough number we can picture everyone. We can see *stories* about every single victims life. The media has the power to tell us so much about these people we know more about them than our neighbours. They also can tell us exactly what happened, how awful it was, how terrified the people were and how nobody could do much to help. You can picture it, and why wouldn't that scare you?

Yet the average rate of people in the UK dying due to terrorism is *incredibly* low. Even taking the 7/7 bombings as the start point and this as the end to get the highest average rate, it's roughly 8-10 people per year (if you go back to include 9/11, it's about the same). The same as the number of people who die in canals in Greater Manchester alone.

That's not to trivialise what's happened, but to add to the point that this all scares people much more than more deadly things do. If the aim was to kill britons, you could probably do much more damage by trying to make smoking sexier or drinking more attractive. A small amount of power to influence legislation could cause more harm through lax regulations.

It commented that just few months ago there was a terrorist attack in [Tunis, the capital (in middle of 'safe' zone)](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/18/eight-people-killed-in-attack-on-tunisia-bardo-museum). 

There was also a paragraph that said 400k brits went to Tunisia in 2014 (before ISIS became a major force in Libya next door) and that citizens were now a potential terror attack and at risk of kidnapping, and to be vigilant.

- makes the right decisions with the ball (unlike Dembele, who sadly too often after a good move, ends up in a blind alley)
- keeps his calm under pressure
- has good close control, isn't afraid to make runs with the ball
- sees openings and possible passes early - and when the risk isn't too high, he manages to get he ball through
- he isn't a DM, but compared to Mason, he has far better awareness of when an opposing player is about to make a run past him.
- this is too early to say, but I see promise in the way he executes his shots. He has the right technique, he manages to keep the ball low, and he gets power behind it.

First, both clubs will be negotiating the value of the players being offered by the buying club, and both sides will most definitely disagree on this, especially since the selling club is in a better position to dictate the price of those players and will ask for the lowest possible valuation. From a money standpoint, it's better to just offer cash and hold on to the offered players until a decent bid comes along.

Next, if both clubs manage to agree on a price, the selling club will be negotiating new contracts for the offered players. Now here's the hard part: what if the selling club does not feel the offered players deserve the wages they are currently making, or the players are asking for a raise the selling club could not afford? It only takes a simple 'no' from one player for the entire deal to fall through, assuming it even gets to the contract part of the deal as the offered players may not want to leave the buying club and join the selling club.

null,false,glilikoi,null,null,null,"How's dumpster diving in the UK? Is it possible, is it popular, is there a lot of negative stigma about it? I'm from a Nordic ""welfare state"" and here dumpster diving has, in recent years, become a pretty accepted everyday thing. Of course the majority of people never do it, and some people sneer at it, but for many (especially young people and students) it's become a normal practical habit. I guess the richer the country, the more good stuff is thrown away.

I guess most people start it out of economical reasons, but for some it's a matter of environmentalism (and why not both). Personally I feel that dumpster diving is a moral thing to do, you're preventing still perfectly edible food from being wasted. Some shop owners feel positive about it as well. The supermarket where I normally go dumpster-diving has a very relaxed attitude regarding this, I sometimes have conversations with the owners and they think it's fine as long as nobody leaves any mess behind. Also, recently there's been a trend for shops to donate more of the food to charity, lleaving less to go to waste. The very restrictive ""safety"" regulations have been slightly relaxed so that the shops can legally give away some officially-expired-but-still-edible food instead of just throwing it away. This is a great direction, and I think everyone is happy about it, even though it obviously means slightly less for the dumpster divers. Even so, not all waste can be prevented. I still get good bread and fruit pretty much daily from the back of my supermarket if I want to, and it's not hurting anybody.

So this is a bit off topic, but since I'm moving to the UK for university in September, I'm actually very curious about the dumpster-diving situation there. Is it commonplace or something viewed as nasty and weird, as it was here a decade ago?

Except when people on programmes like question time have clearly aired there views on homosexuality. And clearly ignoring that homosexuality was only **decriminalised** in recent history; that's right in England it was a crime to be gay as recently as 1967. It is a fallacy to suggest white people are on either side of accepting homosexuality, when clearly there are significant numbers on both sides. And homophobia is rife in many white cultures( as evident by living in the modern world ) You could very easily watch a Stephen Fry documentary.

&gt;It isn't assumptions, there are statistical data on that.

Clearly you have just completely missed the point of statistics here. Statistics is the collection and interpretation of data to allow us to make an educated assumption. But to make the assumption that **ALL** muslims are homophobic is ridiculous because it goes against the collected data as there are most definitely gay muslims who I would assume are not homophobic. I'll let you have most but you can't have all. 

&gt;but if you condemn homophobia that exist among muslims you are likely to have your argument shut down by claims that you are racist.

First off there are no claims of racism anywhere in this thread, so painting yourself as a victim here is pretty pathetic. Secondly those claims of racism might stem from the condemnation of homophobia within Islam instead of just homophobia regardless of its origin. The idea that Homosexuality is immoral is clearly a part of all abrahamic religions, from judaism/Christianity to Islam so it is pretty annoying that your campaign against homophobia isn't as consistent as it should be, and comes across as just a campaign against Muslims. Muslims are **NOT** a monolith. 

&gt;""That said, you can happily criticise the Qurans view on homosexuality just as you can criticise the Bibles view on homosexuality.""
There is much lower % of christian fundamentalist then Muslim fundamentalist. And many people are atheist, there aren't that many ex muslims yet.

Here I particularly like how you quote me before writing something completely irrelevant. My point was you can critique a piece of writing quite easily, but the views of a group of people like muslims who are given an identity at birth(generally) probably/definitely won't all be inline with one another. As is fairly evident from that fact that muslims a killing other muslims( with different views ) on an incredible scale.

And clearly ignoring that homosexuality was only decriminalised in recent history; that's right in England it was a crime to be gay as recently as 1967. It is a fallacy to suggest white people are on either side of accepting homosexuality, when clearly there are significant numbers on both sides. And homophobia is rife in many white cultures( as evident by living in the modern world ) You could very easily watch a Stephen Fry documentary.""


We were talking about UK, but my point was that liberals don't defend homophobia that exist among white people. And they do it by shutting down the debate about homophobia among other ethnic groups.

""Clearly you have just completely missed the point of statistics here. Statistics is the collection and interpretation of data to allow us to make an educated assumption. But to make the assumption that ALL muslims are homophobic is ridiculous because it goes against the collected data as there are most definitely gay muslims who I would assume are not homophobic. I'll let you have most but you can't have all.""

I didn't I had said ""it makes a difference when vast majority of people hold those views vs a small minority.""

""First off there are no claims of racism anywhere in this thread, so painting yourself as a victim here is pretty pathetic. Secondly those claims of racism might stem from the condemnation of homophobia within Islam instead of just homophobia regardless of its origin.""

That is nonsense, Christian based homophobia is condemned all of the time, are you against this christianophobia as well ? This is the double standard that I was talking about. And you did claim that I am a far right winger who hates Jews. 

""The idea that Homosexuality is immoral is clearly a part of all abrahamic religions, from judaism/Christianity to Islam so it is pretty annoying that your campaign against homophobia isn't as consistent as it should be, and comes across as just a campaign against Muslims. Muslims are NOT a monolith.""

In real world Christians fundamentalist are condemned by mass media, while media avoid talking about the same problem in among Muslim fundamentalist.

""Clearly not taking into account our eastern european brothers. Who generally aren't the biggest fans of gay people. This might have something do with those people calling you a racist, not that I'd agree with them.""

People in UK have no influence on them, they should focus on people who live in the UK. Your suggestion that I somehow support far right in Russia because I am critical of religious fundamentalism is ridiculous, your attitude is part of the problem that I am talking about.

There are two sides to Scottish historical tourism, I feel; the commercially developed (castles, landmarks, monuments) and the quieter, harder to find history that requires pre-reading. Scotland has a very rich, very deep history, and it is impossible to really cover it all in one visit, you have a good 800 years at least to try and understand! If you are truly interested in the history, now would be a good time to start doing some basic reading, you will have a much more fulfilling visit if you can understand at least the basics of it :) There is a lot of more modern history in the past century or so too, it really depends in what you are interested.

Since you are planning on heading towards Skye, you could look at going to Culloden Battlefield in Inverness, depending on which way you will be driving. You could also visit Fort William and Glen Coe. 

I've left a wee list of some good links to start your reading at below.

I guess, think it's a bit sly of the Government to tax it, but meh, the Lottery Fund is just used by the Government to save on Government spending.

&gt;•Who do you think gambles more--the rich, middle class, or poor/working class?

Depends what you mean, by £ or by % of income? % is more useful so I would go with the poor.

&gt;•How do you feel about the National Lottery in general?

He just doesnt seem to have a lot of actual talent, he is just a really good athlete. And that isnt good enough to be even close to the premier league.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;We were talking about UK, but my point was that liberals don't defend homophobia that exist among white people. And they do it by shutting down the debate about homophobia among other ethnic groups.

Please tell me of just one *liberal* that **defends** homophobia in non-white ethnic groups, please. Your trying to paint yourself as a victim again and its just bollocks. 

&gt;""First off there are no claims of racism anywhere in this thread, so painting yourself as a victim here is pretty pathetic. Secondly those claims of racism might stem from the condemnation of homophobia within Islam instead of just homophobia regardless of its origin.""
That is nonsense, Christian based homophobia is condemned all of the time, are you against this christianophobia as well ? This is the double standard that I was talking about. And you did claim that I am a far right winger who hates Jews.

Again, trying to paint yourself as victim. I at no point claimed any of this was Islamaphobic and you clearly don't know what your talking about as I at no point defended Islamic Homophobia I merely pointed out the fact that Christian Homophobia is kind of thing also, seeing as in my fathers lifetime homosexuality went from something that was a criminal offence to something that I feel is generally celebrated. And the fact that I have on many occasions seen/heard homophobic sentiment from White Christians. I didn't object to your dislike of Islamic homophobia, I also find it detestable. I just felt it was important to point out that homophobia is clearly not a problem unique to Islam.

And at what point exactly did I call you **'a far right winger who hates Jews' ?** You can't just make shit up.

&gt;In real world Christians fundamentalist are condemned by mass media, while media avoid talking about the same problem in among Muslim fundamentalist.

Again just complete and utter bollocks. Muslim fundamentalists aren't condemned by the media? Seriously? The 'Media' gives a fair account of Muslim Fundies for what they are homicidal manics with the brain power of a doorknob. A genuine question here, when all we seem to be talking about is Islamic terrorism why do people like you say "" we need to talk about Islam! "" when we already are? It makes you look mentally deficient. 

&gt; ""Clearly not taking into account our eastern european brothers. Who generally aren't the biggest fans of gay people. This might have something do with those people calling you a racist, not that I'd agree with them.""
People in UK have no influence on them, they should focus on people who live in the UK. Your suggestion that I somehow support far right in Russia because I am critical of religious fundamentalism is ridiculous, your attitude is part of the problem that I am talking about. It shuts down any meaningful debate. You might not actively support Muslim fundamentalist but you actively protect them from being criticized.

At no point did I say that you ' support far right in Russia ' because you are ' critical of religious fundamentalism ' , I merely pointed out that homophobia among white people isn't wholly condemned as you suggested. How does pointing out the fact that Islam might not be the root cause of Homophobia( seeing as mainly Homophobia has existed for far longer than Islam and is present in situations that don't involve Islam) shut down any argument. 

Also I at no point intended to prevent you from critiquing Islam.

First of all we know deep down homosexuality is wrong, it couldn't be clearer in Leviticus 18:22 as it says: ""Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable."" Now while you may try to reject that, you're not only harming the ones you are sitting back and watching commit sin, but also harming your soul. While you may try to argue it is their personal freedom to do as they wish but just remember all it takes for evil to triumph, is for good men to do nothing.

Secondly the major issue is pride. Pride is the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins, so not only are you committing the sin of homosexuality, you are then confounding it by rubbing God and everyone else's faces in it.

  Rodgers doesn't like DMs. He's going to keep searching for a box-to-box or playmaker type who can also defend a bit until he either finds one who fits his preferred system or he gets sacked. 

  To be honest, with the largely immobile Gerrard gone and Milner, Can and Henderson to pick a starting pair from, a DM is less relevant. All of these players are strong and mobile, and I'm assuming that Rodgers is banking on them organising themselves so that at least one of them is available to break up play when we lose possession. The plan will be that whichever two are playing will share the workload that a DM would be doing.

""HMG"" doesn't make decisions. Individuals inside the Government do.

It's long been accepted that a certain amount of corruption is ""just part of how you do business in the Saudi Arabia"". What this means in practice is that the relationship between the British government, UK-based contractors, and the House of Saud depends upon the flow of vast sums of money to anonymous shell companies in places like the Cayman island.

(There is an excellent Private Eye article about the Government's complicity in this, including how Lt Col (ret) Ian Foxley, a British man working in the Kingdom for an EADS subsidiary, asked the MoD about a series of suspicious payments. The MoD responded by *simply forwarding the email to his Saudi bosses*, a clear attempt to silence him that put him in real danger of arrest. I don't think it can be read online for free, so [this FT article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ddaebb48-ed78-11e4-a894-00144feab7de.html) will have to do.)

null,false,rubygeek,null,null,null,"Classical liberalism started out firmly on the left - the original left-right divide centered on support for the monarchy or not. Libertarianism as a subset of liberalism started out much further on the left, and the first major exponent for libertarianism was the leadership of the Socialist League, which counted as its supporters people like Eleanor Marx and Friedrich Engels. 

Liberal and libertarian Marxism has been a thing since the 1870's (the First International split over disagreement between Bakunin and Marx which caused the anarchists and some other libertarian socialist groups to break away; new libertarian Marxist tendencies soon saw substantial growth in the remaining parts of the First International as the anarchists were no longer the exponent for libertarianism within the organisation). 

Lenin even wrote a book denouncing it (""Left Communism: An infantile disorder"") because he was worried about the level of support the liberal groups were gaining. In fact, he fought for decades against liberal Marxism, including within his own party prior to the Menshevik/Bolshevik split.

Lenins little coup d'etat, for that's what the October ""revolution"" was, was not an uprising targeting the Czar, who had already been overthrown months previously, but the Bolsheviks grappling with limited popular support by overthrowing the democratically elected *liberal* socialist provisional government which included a substantial number of liberal Marxists, and step by step outlawing and eventually imprisoning and murdering any proponent of liberal socialism - Marxist or otherwise - they could get their hands on.

So calling Marxism anti-liberal is ignoring history. There are plenty of ideologies that claim a lineage to Marx or Marxism that are anti-liberal yes. There are also plenty of ideologies that claim a lineage to Marx and Marxism that are liberal and libertarian. The two sets are sufficiently at odds that a large number of the latter have been persecuted and often executed for their support for liberal principles by the former.

-----

West coast main line is our most overloaded line, the busiest in Europe to be exact.

It's already standing room only and growing.

We can either slow it down to claw back a bit of capacity or build more capacity. Longer trains, electrification and improved junctions are all maxed out. Better signals are on the way but won't make much of a dent.

HS2 will replace the express services that don't stop outside of major cities. This frees up paths for more freight and semi fast comuter services. Milton Keynes and rugby will do particularly well out of it.

With HS2 taking 18 trains per hour each train having more seats than now that is a massive capacity gain

If your getting one of the wcml express trains today your journey will move to hs2. The trains on the new line can be 400m long and those that don't need to use classic lines can be double decker. This means thousands of extra seats per hour and a speed up thrown in because why not. If we're building a new line may aswell make it as fast as we can because the cost diferance is uterly marginal.


Tldr capacity &gt; speed.

You could invoice a usage/rights fee in future if they change the poster and then chase it to small-claims. 

I am a designer as well - I have had similar experiences in the past. My honest (non-legal) advise would be to write it off as a lesson not in failing to to contract it properly but in spotting a crap client. 

Chasing this will piss off the old client (and a pissed of client can be damaging even if you don't want more work from them again. It is a small world and if word can get around that *you* mess people around with money no matter how unfair this accusation is then you are in trouble. Clients never understand why they cannot modify the work, why they have to pay you *again* for work you have already done - they will see your protests as a cash grab rather than wanting to control your work)

What I would suggest you do on a rainy day is load up a whole load of boilerplates for different design work @ docracy.com - it takes two minutes to issue terms once the boilerplate is in place if you correctly markup the templates to add client names/milestones/turnarounds etc

Or if you do find yourself in a situation where you need the money just bite the bullet - do a great job for a crap client and then walk away and forget about it.

Almost as if you expect anyone reading to know what you mean, even if you leave enough info out that your comment reads like you're being insulting - how about that.

No, I'm saying your comments look awful when using that much suffering as leverage because you don't like the finer details/ potential changes in our Government's home policies.

&gt;For you to be saying ""they have to reach the initial stage first"" you're likewise acknowldging our government is more immediate.

I was talking about the governments in the countries you mentioned having to reach a similar stage of freedom. But well done for putting our local 'problems' first *again*.

Sure, because no replies means that everyone reading agrees with you, right? Self-justification-tastic! Shall we move onto what 'circlejerk' actually means?

You do try to save money? That's not very nice of you.

Their beer does *not* tend to be kept in poor condition. Most of them keep it well, some have enough turnover that it would be hard to fuck up, and some are execrable. I'm fairly sure that they match the rest of the pub universe in general in this regard.

I'm with you on the food. I generally use Wetherspoons because they're convenient for a railway station. If I'm hungry at a railway station, I'll get a sandwich instead of eating at 'spoons.

People with serious alcohol problems don't drink at Wetherspoons. 2 quid for a pint of beer is a very expensive way of buying booze compared to corner shop industrial alcohol with an apple printed on the can. LONELY people without much money do go there though, and drink very very slowly. My local 'spoons usually has a table of domino players at the front all day - they appear to be older men with no family, spending the day with their few friends. I'm sure they'd love to do something other than go to the pub, but that requires money.

“Britain’s skies are already some of the busiest in the world, and Howard Davies knows that these expansion plans cannot be made to fit with the UK’s long-term commitments under the Climate Change Act. Contrary to aviation lobby rhetoric, a new runway is not needed to allow more international business flights, which have been declining steadily since the turn of the century.

“The hub airport argument is a smokescreen. In reality, growing demand for air travel is concentrated in the short-haul leisure sector and among a small, wealthy minority of the population. It is more of these flights that a new runway will in practice service.

“This growth in flights is driven by air fares that are kept artificially low through generous tax subsidies; aviation is exempt from fuel duty by international treaty and zero rated for VAT, alongside wheelchairs and baby clothes. Yet these tax breaks almost exclusively benefit the richest section of British society. Our analysis of passenger survey data shows that 15% of the UK population are taking 70% of all our flights, while half of us don’t fly at all in any given year.

“That’s why we are calling today to replace Air Passenger Duty with a ‘frequent flyer levy’ that taxes travellers according to how often they fly, shifting the burden away from families flying to their one annual holiday and onto the frequent flyers who are driving expansion. Our research shows that this 'polluter pays' approach would enable the UK to meet our climate targets without making flying the preserve of the rich - and without needing to build any new runways.”

null,false,maxyyb99,,Year 11,null,"Honestly? Congratulations dude. I think this is probably pretty different from what everyone else is saying, but in all seriousness, good job.

I, personally, didn't cheat - to be honest, I am one of those horrible nerds who can wing it and get top grades anyway, so I felt relatively secure with the revision I did do. I didn't really see much benefit to it, in terms of risk vs gain. 

But if, say, the papers had been leaked online, I definitely would have taken a look. Why? Because these tests don't exactly measure ability, they measure recall skills (and I say that as someone who possesses ability and recall skills in abundance), and every advantage is worth having.

At the end of the day, this isn't a moral issue. If cheating is ruining it for everyone else, so are the people who forgo sleep to get in extra revision - it's a case of getting yourself every conceivable advantage. This is a competition. It's not about your own self worth and ability, it's about getting yourself into a better position than everyone else, so you can keep that better position. This is how you start to be able to get access to better resources, and move forward further.

If, as you say, you didn't rely on it that much, and it you only consulted it a little bit for some exams, then fine. There is certainly the capacity for this to come back to bite you, because it could be the start of a bad habit you can't always maintain. I doubt you'd be able to get away with it again next year, or the year after that - there will be situations when you won't be able to do this. 

But since you got away with it? Congratulations, seriously, and I hope your grades are good.

(Though, to any year 10s reading this, it probably isn't worth the risk. The possibility of being caught is relatively high, I would say, and the punishments can be fairly extreme. Worst case scenario, you get kicked off of every exam you're taking with that board - so, for example, had I cheated in AQA Chemistry, I could have been taking out of AQA Physics, Biology, English Literature, Computer Science, and German. The potential for this to go wrong is very, very high, and I think success stories like OP are quite rare.

Well marbled meat should have small amounts of fat evenly through the lean tissue. Better marbling for tastier meat means more expensive grains, longer feeding times, activity and a lower yield.

CASH ISA is currenlty setup up HSBC. I would love to do the shares there aswell to keep it all together, but i am not able to find the funds the index funds that i want at HSBC.. (strange?!)


SHARES ISA i want to setup with CAVENDISH who seem to be pretty good to start with.
Investment should be:

Fly the Nazi Flag outside a Synagogue. Burn a Giant Cross and Festoon it with Nooses. They don't mean anything to you cause you  were never the victims of their particular hate. 

Freedom of Speech to push a racist emblem is the usage of that freedom to harm others. 

As I said. You will never ever get it because you have never experienced it. It's not the fuckwit with this sort of flag that's the problem (usually). They just shout stupid shit. Like oh no! The idiot who has no job and no education and knows fuck nothing thinks I am a fucking inferior sub-human. Let me go weep over the fact that I have enough education in a field that will keep me in money/barter/bottlecaps even if we lived in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland. 

The problem is the fact that when a government organisation buys into this crap, it is then we see a sustained effort that harms people. 

You tell me, if a government agrees that it is okay to run a racist emblem as a symbol... how many minorities are part of that government. And tell me, how seriously is that government listening to people of colour. 

Not that seriously. It's just finding excuses to protect a racist emblem. It's like the Nazi Germany Flag or the Flag of the Empire of the Rising Sun. It's a cool bit of memorabilia for you. It's the emblem of genocide for others and a symbol of the people who committed atrocities that cannot even be fathomed by you.

Does UAF counts?
""In 2006 David Tate argued that the Socialist Workers Party was seeking to dominate the UAF.[40] David Toube claims that the organisations involved in the UAF avoid condemnation of antisemitism.[41]

LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell has accused UAF of a selective approach to bigotry: ""UAF commendably opposes the BNP and EDL but it is silent about Islamist fascists who promote anti-Semitism, homophobia, sexism and sectarian attacks on non-extremist Muslims. It is time the UAF campaigned against the Islamist far right as well as against the EDL and BNP far right.""[27]

The journalist Andrew Gilligan has claimed that the UAF's reluctance to tackle Islamism is that several of its own members are supporters of such extremism. The UAF's vice-chairman, Azad Ali, has links to al-Qaeda and is also community affairs coordinator of the Islamic Forum of Europe, which Gilligan describes as ""a Muslim supremacist group dedicated to changing 'the very infrastructure of society, its institutions, its culture, its political order and its creed from ignorance to Islam'"".[27] According to Gilligan, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Lee Rigby in 2013, spoke ""on the margins"" of a 2009 UAF demonstration in Harrow.[27] Secretary Weyman Bennett responded by saying that Adebolajo was not an official speaker.""

How many liberals dare to criticize them? Why is this issue ignored by the media?

""I also find it detestable. I just felt it was important to point out that homophobia is clearly not a problem unique to Islam.""

I had not claimed that it is a unique problem to Islam (it is mostly a problem of abrahamic religions in general), but when I criticize Christianity nobody claims that I am racist, and change subject to Islam.

""At no point did I say that you ' support far right in Russia ' because you are ' critical of religious fundamentalism ' , I merely pointed out that homophobia among white people isn't wholly condemned as you suggested. How does pointing out the fact that Islam might not be the root cause of Homophobia( seeing as mainly Homophobia has existed for far longer than Islam and is present in situations that don't involve Islam) shut down any argument.""

Using this logic Nazism can't be blamed for antisemitism because not only Nazist were antisemitic. I had never claimed that nobody else is homophobic it your straw man argument.

""Finally before I go I want to let you know that I won't replying to any of your comments seeing as you accused me of calling you 'a far right winger who hates Jews' when I clearly didn't.""

Historic cases are always harder because memories have faded, evidence is lost etc etc. Historic abuse cases harder still as they tend to be he said/she said for the actual abuse. Add in the fact that the high profile people are likely to be more believable than your standard joe (At least at the beginning of all this..) plus that many of the accusers are likely to be less educated/lower class and often have a history of drug or mental health problems (which may have in fact been caused by the abuse but anyway...) and you have a perfect recipe for a difficult case.

The cases brought seem to be ones where there are multiple accusers with a familiar pattern of attacks. If you can prove that the defendant was where accusers said they were and several independent people all tell the same sort of story of abuse, the case becomes a lot stronger.

Do you think that would end well for her, even if it was true (Disclaimer: that was just meant to be a real world demonstration with real places and communities, not an aspersion on either the place or community)? Of course not, she would be asked to make a retraction and it would most likely wreck her career.

This is why we have the term political correctness at all - the distinction between factual accuracy (e.g. someone says that there is an issue with child abuse in a minority community at this location) and political correctness (there is an ongoing investigation into allegations of child abuse at this location) is, effectively, what politicians think they can say. Sometimes this is not a bad thing - saying for example that poor people do drugs more often might be accurate, but is not appropriate. In other cases, such as Rotherham, it is extremely dangerous, creating a chilling effect where people don't find things out and when they do it is often never said due to fear of being accused of bigotry. The issue with the BBC would never have had anything to do with political correctness, as firstly the accusations were against specific people, and secondly the majority of accused weren't protected classes. Why would it be non-PC just to tell the absolute version of things in that case?

null,false,Schlagv,null,null,null,"Tons of research let people think that IQ is a real thing, that it is the first factor of economic success (before social class of the parents) and that it is largely geneticly inherited. And more generally, the same is true for lots of behavioural traits. Violence is especially studied, but also many other things like social trust radius, sexual drive, religious thinking, following group orders and many other things most likely have a strong genetic predisposition.

Predispositions are like for obesity. On paper, someone with the fat genes can be perfectly healthy. But most people follow the easy path that a society promotes. So at the population level, culture + genes create the outcome. Culture of food production evolved and made obesity appear and we discovered how we are not equal before diabete and obesity.

The part where things get ugly is that for groups of people, the average distribution of genes is not the same and there are some group specific genes (like some Jew genetic diseases that are suspected to give higher IQ but the research to definitely prove/disprove it was never done, at least officially). We admit it for fat storage related genes. But we don't admit it for other behaviours. By groups, it can mean race and social class and sex (the sex part of the DNA creates male/female specific features that interact with non-sex specific parts of the DNA that can vary between groups, so males of a group can have different predispositions than males of an other while it doesn't affect females the same way).

Studying those things would allow an understanding of why people succed and why they fail. But there are many risks:

- creating self realising prophecies if people stop working against their predispositions

- relaunching what was the root cause of eugenics

- giving arguments to various kinds of racists and sexists

So when someone finds something that goes in that direction he is told to study something else, which is bad. They keep a low profile to make their research remain poorly known, which is quite good as we don't want imprecise research to be used as propaganda. The issue is that we never reach good understanding as the in depth research is cancelled.

And while this happens, you have a part of the sociology departments courses that promote to their students the opposite idea as basis for their education.

And with those ideas they try to socially engineers changes that go against the predispositions of many people. With good goals usually, but awful methods. And they violently repress any public suggestion that people are not equal before the changes that are advocated.

See, this is the problem. We're all doing it. Both sides. The vitriol is universal. It's just that we only notice when it's directed at us personally. As an unrepentant leftie and progressive, you should see some of the names I've been called on this subreddit whenever we broach the subjects of immigration, Islam, safe spaces, workplace quotas or FGM. Wait another month for the next fearmongering story about foreigners to get voted to the top of this sub. When you look at the comments, there will be a small minority of users throwing around the term ""Labour voter"" as if it were a dirty word. If you don't believe me, I'll go and dig out some quotes from my inbox from when I've been on the wrong side of the outrage.

As for left leaning, I don't know. I've always felt like this subreddit had the usual redditor leaning, but with a British perspective. It's very pro free speech, open internet, free education, but suspicious of ""political correctness"" and surprisingly old fashioned on women's issues: very much in focused on issues that affect young, technically-literate men.

The UK has something of a reputation for having a good justice system; fairly professional lawyers, honest judges and so on. It's part of what makes London a popular(ish) place for a lot of international contracts etc. to be based, particularly things relating to admiralty law.

So naturally the various governments see this as an asset the country has and look for ways to sell it to others. A while back I came across a nice document published by the MoJ (iirc), which was pretty much an advertising pamphlet, with quotes from senior judges etc., encouraging rich foreign people to use our justice system...

Consequently, when something good is said about Muslims, the assumption is made that the person making the comment is trying to make all Muslims out to be good, so someone else will feel the need to point out something bad. Then someone else will assume that the 2nd person means to suggest that Muslims can't possibly be good, or that they are trying to cancel out the good, and it all escalates from there. 

I think that ultimately everyone is just trying to reach middle ground, but unfortunately the loudest voices are those who are either to emotional or too inept to do so.

&gt;__Scotch-Irish__ (or __Scots-Irish__) __Americans__ are [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) descendants of [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) and other [Ulster Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Protestant) [Dissenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenters) from the Irish province of [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) who migrated to [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) during the 18th and 19th centuries.   While an estimated 36 million Americans (12% of the total population) reported Irish ancestry in 2006, and 6 million (2% of the population) reported Scottish ancestry,  an additional 5.4 million (1.8% of the population) identified more specifically with Scotch-Irish ancestry. The term *Scotch-Irish* is used only in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States),  with people in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) or [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) who are of a similar ancestry referring to themselves as [Ulster Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people).

Then lead the way, comrade.

If he is desperate for success he should be leading the way already, get hungry and compete. We all watched him become a wallflower toward the end of the season.

My point was that if you are using *this* as the justification of Christians being peaceful and Muslims being violent, then by extension you are saying that Judaism is also a violent religion.

Plus you don't see all the Christian sects that don't believe the ""new covenant"" interpretation being violent either.

The truth is that Islam can be just as peaceful as any other religion, the *problem* is that it's not in a lot more cases than other religions. But it's just about the current state of the believers and what they do/don't do... it's just social and cultural stuff, not *really* anything to do with the specific content of the religious text, but it still is related to the religion itself, because people with that religion are in a community that has elements which teach this interpretation.

It is something that *can* change and shift over time, it could become (as a whole/average) more peaceful, or more radical. The factors that will affect this change are not the content, which has never changed after all, but social aspects such as upbringing and education.

After all, Christianity has had the new Testament for quite a flipping long time now, yet over all that time it wasn't always so peaceful, was it?

After this, my bike was written off, I told WQ and they said I needed to get it re-MOT'd once it was repaired. I ended up repairing it myself, however halfway through repairs I broke my collarbone.  I called them to say  I couldn't get it repaired by their deadline, so they gave me an extension. I ended up getting an MOT done the day before they needed the cert, unfortunately the bike failed on headset bearings. I then called WQ who told me that if I didn't get the MOT passed, they'd cancel my insurance, and I'd owe them £400 odd cos I pay monthly. I wanted to sort the bearings myself, but didn't have time so had to pay the workshop to do it, which was a £300 bill I could have done without.

As for hardworking, lets face it, politicians mean 'high earning', they have zero interest in anyone who needs benefits to get by, no matter how much hard graft they're putting in.

I know inactivity leads to higher intramuscular fat, but so does high activity. My understanding is that the former led to excessive fatty deposits but I have no reference.

I thought kobe beef cows were a relatively unique breed with a particular diet. Diet as a key factor in IM fat is discussed in this [beef research article](http://www.beefresearch.org/CMDocs/BeefResearch/PE_White_%20Papers/Marbling%20-%20Management%20of%20cattle%20to%20maximize%20the%20deposition%20of%20intramuscular%20adipose%20tissue.pdf), but activity is not.

Either way, the importance of marbling, and quality control through environment, diet and genetics is a contributor to cost of higher quality meat.

&gt;A Cornell University report** has assessed the Greenhouse Gas footprint of Shale Gas over a 20- and 100-year lifetime. Compared with conventional gas and coal, unconventional (shale) gas releases more methane into the atmosphere – it is estimated that 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane escapes in venting and leaks. “Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over time periods of a couple of decades following emission.” Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is 1.2- to 2.1-fold greater on the 20-year timeframe. In short Shale gas is simply not a ‘green’ fuel.

&gt;No, we won't. In the UK not only are we surrounded by water, but it also rains a shitload. We will never ever run out of drinkable water in the UK.

Spectacular, blinkered and willful ignorance. I seriously recommend you go and read up on the water crisis. It's not even up for debate and global warming will very quickly put paid to all the rain you seem to be short termedly delighting in.

We'd be losing £35k by not playing him, but £35k is nothing if he plays regularly and puts in performances like the first half of 14/15. 

&gt;Your argument is gambling on him reaching the potential we saw when he had players like Suarez distracting the other team. But if he doesnt, and he hasnt come close to that form when he is the main focus of the other team, he might be worth 10-15m, a 40ish mil difference. Is that worth it?

He was one of our best player's and performing to a level not far from his 13/14 form in the first 3/4 months of 14/15, so that's nonsense really. It's pretty clear (unless you're extremely deluded) that most of his problems this season were down to fatigue, you can't play a 19/20 year old in 60 games a season after playing in the WC and expect him not to have major fatigue issues half way through the season. It says a lot when Ronaldo/Messi/Hazard etc didn't play anywhere near that amount of games @ that age, I haven't been able to find anyone who did.

If he is managed properly he'll perform, no doubt about it. Says a lot about Rodgers/Hodgson when the kid was crying about being tired in October after Rodgers/Hodgson both overplayed him to fuckery

My main takeaway from the gamergate debacle is that your movement is only as good as the worst people in it.

If members of the Sunshine And Lolipops Society routinely murder kittens at their meet ups, they can't look the other way and then complain when people associate them with kitten murder even if it's only a small percentage doing it. If they can't deal with that, maybe try building a movement around something more organised than vague disgruntlement and a hashtag next time, eh!

I do think there's a debate worth having about social media outrage culture though, and whether the use of public shaming techniques to punish any ideological transgressions is really making the world a better place.

It's a slippery issue because individually no one's necessarily doing anything wrong. Anyone involved can step back and say ""It's their right to say what they want, but it's also my right to respond to it"", which seems fair enough on the face of it.

The problem is, if that if that response goes viral or gets picked up by a media hungry for controversy it has a way of putting the target in the middle of a hurricane of negative attention, whether they're actually guilty of what they're accused of or not. And there can be tangible consequences for them, while the keyboard warriors can just move on to the next target.

With that implied threat hanging over everyone's head I can understand the impulse to keep your head down and not do anything that might lead someone, somewhere, to read something the wrong way and push the red button that sets the digital mob on you.

vented for safety reasons. During exploration an operator may find gas that is not economic to
recover, in which case they will flare it. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 80%

Rubbish. For much of Christian history the old testament has been extremely influential on Christian lifestyles. Here's 3 examples:

- Bans on usury during the middle ages
- Eating fish on Fridays
- Condemnation of gays (St Paul was also anti-gay, but most of the extreme anti-gay stuff, which was used to justify jailing of gay men, was old testament).

&gt;  only Jesus' message is due to Jesus sacrifice being the fulfilment of the OT laws so they are no longer valid other than for providing context. 

That's highly debatable. Here's what the Book of Matthew actually says:

&gt; Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

This means US fracked energy can only be sold on their market and it has caused a glut of supply that has driven down prices. This will not be reproduced for the UK so we'll end up paying market rate for any energy out of it.

I'm aware of this, and support this policy because it means our businesses are viable at real global energy prices, not subsidised prices that may or may not last.

So the decision on your £4k boils down to your time horizon. If you don't need the money anytime soon, then ignore the media frenzy.

However, in terms of where the £4k sits, in a Nutmeg share ISA, make sure you understand what they've invested it in. If you've chosen wisely, again, you can ignore the media. Good investments look after themselves.

German was compulsory Years 7-9 (aged 11-14). I decided to continue it as I felt it was quite easy to learn compared to other languages and I felt it would be beneficial for my future. A lot of schools tell students that a language is very good for university. 


&gt; - what did you like / didn't like about your German lessons?

Difficult to remember. It was very similar to typical language lessons at a school. Open the text book to page XX, learn something as a group, practice with your partner, answer the questions in the book.  Very dry and very boring. 

&gt; - what subject matter should have been more the focus of your lessons?
 (vocab, pronunciation, grammar, etc.)?

School lessons always focus on learning basic phrases that end up having no use in later life. I holiday in Germany quite regularly now but I don't think my German lessons helped much. It's important to learn the grammar, vocab and pronunciation but I've never had call to ask people where they live or what their favourite school subject is (Mein liblingsfach ist Kunst). It would have been beneficial to learn things more likely to be used in adult life.

&gt; - do you think that learning a foreign language such as German has in any way helped you in terms of career choices etc.? 

Nope, but it might in future. I'd like to live and work in Germany at some point. 

&gt; - maybe just share anecdotes / stories from your experiences with  foreign language education in UK schools (not necessarily Scotland).

[Falklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute)

&gt;Argentina which has no claim.

For shame sir.

I worked as an FLA in French Canada and it was a great experience. Just make sure that your students are having fun while learning - too many people have bad memories of sub-par rote language teaching at school, especially in the UK. 

I tended to find that most English people don't have much of a problem with German pronunciation, especially in Scotland and northern England where we retained the Germanesque pre-Vowel Shift vowel pronunciations. Try and make it clear to students that English and German are more similar than they would think - for example, I found it much easier to remember the past tense irregular verbs when I realised that most of them are the irregular ones in English as well (fliegen-geflogen / fly-flew, gehen-gegangen-ging / go-gone-went, etc.).

There's also a somewhat fixed image of German culture in the UK as a bit out-of-date and odd; try and fix that by showing modern German culture: our university lecture introduced us to modern German films (Die Welle, Das Leben der Anderen...) and modern German music and by the end most of us really appreciated it.

From a pure engineering perspective though fracking is incredibly safe in a well regulated environment (which the UK is). 

* The chemicals OKed for use in the UK are all non-toxic and used in tiny concentrations

* It's impossible for fractures to propagate into aquifers (they don't have the energy to travel far enough).

* Even if a fracture did propagate into an aquifer it'd be impossible for flacking fluid to flow into it thanks to the local hydrogeological conditions of most of the UK

* The cases are triple cased (not double cased like in much of the US) with all three casings passing through any aquifers. Before the well can be used the casing must be examined by an independent examiner who must inform the HSE if they're unsatisfied. This regulatory practice continues for the production life of the well. 

* After decommissioning, well owners, by law, must continue to monitor their wells for a period of time. 

* We've been fracking for decades in the North Sea anyway. 

If you ask most chemical engineers or geologists they'd be ok with fracking from an engineering point of view.

Also, I heard (from a very reliable source - I'm no ITK but I'm 99% certain about the reliability of this source) that LVG was impressed with Henderson. Their (United) preseason came last year against LFC in America, their plan was all about stopping Henderson.
Henderson has the same agent at the time (Key Sports Management I believe) as Chris Smalling. Smalling told the agent about the admiration from LVG and the agent duly used it as leverage to get Henderson an improved contract plus vice-captaincy otherwise the agent would try and unsettle Henderson into a move away.

null,false,twogunsalute,null,null,null,"&gt; what made you take up German in the first place?

Apparently when we were in primary school we were supposed to get letters asking us to choose whether to study French or German in secondary school for the next 5 years. Turns out no one got these letters so classes were assigned. When this was realised our German teacher asked us who actually wanted to study German and nobody did, we all wanted to do French.

&gt; what did you like / didn't like about your German lessons?

Our teacher was pretty bad. Nice enough as a person but too timid and she just did not teach us very well. She didn't seem to teach us the basics like even when to use der, die, das etc and she accidentally taught us the French months...

&gt; do you think that learning a foreign language such as German has in any way helped you in terms of career choices etc.?

It's important to learn a foreign language and I think we should be learning them from primary school until college. But the teaching is just too poor in this country to actually be of any use.

I've taken evening classes in French and as short as they were I learnt so much more than in 5 years of studying German. Personally I'm not even sure German is a great language to be studying anyway, French is more useful and Spanish is supposed to be easier",null,0,null,1435582102,null,0,1435584327,0,csmbkx1,null,t3_3bhxdm,null,t1_csmbkx1,null,t3_3bhxdm,null,null,null,1437435743,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Arabella is safe and magic is restored, but will Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell ever return? #StrangeAndNorrell pic.twitter.com/9gO3XhwKtD

‘Will they ever return?’ Well if they weren’t going to, chances are the Beeb would have just kept schtum right?

Does this include conveyancing, surveying, etc?

&gt;Expenses - £1000

This seems very low. Is this for actual maintenance? I think you need to be looking at closer to £2500 for a student let HMO with the odd year of much bigger expenses.

&gt;Landlord insurance covers damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear.

First, good luck claiming on these insurance products. Once you get past the excess, they're going to put up a fight as to what is and isn't normal wear and tear. Its very difficult to define. [EDIT: Keep in mind that normal wear and tear with a couple of students is very different than normal wear with a single professional. Your threshold is going to be very high. This is a perfectly valid argument for the insurer.] Any LL with a few years under his/her belts knows that these insurance products are feeble. Same goes for void period coverage (though this is the one advantage of student lets, you can get the parents to guarantee). 

Second, how much is the cover? Is this coupled into your expenses? If so, your expenses are even more wrong. There's no other way to put it. If those expenses were suggested by the agents, you need to look for new management. That advice is pure negligence.  

I reckon your true gross is going to be closer to £4k, all said and done. Your first year or two running in the game will probably not even break even. 

Goes to show BTL's are such poor investments these days. 10+ years late on the bandwagon.

Correct. The gas that would be vented or flared in a gas processing plant would be the stripping gas or regeneration gas used in either TEG dehydration or solid dessicant dehydration. However, it can be as much as 10-12% of the total produced gas. If joule-Thomson dehydration was used then very little flaring or venting would be required as part of the process.


EDIT: I should add that the stripping gas or regeneration gas does not necessarily have to be flared (and most likely would not be allowed in the UK) but in places with poor environmental legislation it is usually the most economical process option.

The Falkland Islanders are British, though they set their own immigration policies.

So your argument against the British is ""colonialism bad"" but the argument for them being given (not returned, just given) to Argentina is ""we have to respect colonialism?"" Why do you think Spanish colonialism is ok, but British colonialism must be condemned? 

There are, of course, arguments against the colonial claims of Spain, and the suggestion that it extended to Argentina, but none so powerful as the fact that not one single Argentinian has been born, raised and died on the islands, and that the people who have lived there for generations have the right to self-determination.

An inexperienced prospect and a relatively unproven ST make them one of the best? All the while losing Mandzu who was one of the top goalscores for them. That would be like saying the signing of (just for example) Douglas Costa and Max Meyer has turned City into a top 4 side. That's just doesn't work. Even then like half of their squad is 30 years old. By the time those young prospects become good, a lot of those players that are necessary for development won't even be there. Then I also said if you go back, Griezmann and Turan are QUESTIONABLE. I never said they are leaving. Which is fair. It's not in the books that they are 100% staying right now is it? So questionable is the right status for them right now. If they lose both, or even one. They aren't a top 4 team.

Juve again isn't there. I've already said Pirlo didn't have a great season, but he did win them vital game winning goals if you watched their season. Which is a huge loss. Dybala is unproven as well. Remember when Demba Ba was knocking in ~10-15 goals a season. Also, Khedira isn't making *any* team a top side. Sorry, that's just not how it works.  He's great, but not a game winner or a super vital signing that would completely turn thing around for a team. Then like I said before Vidal and Pogba are QUESTIONABLE. Meaning they could stay, or could not stay. If one or more of them leaves. They aren't top 4. The reason why Juve are Juve is because of Marchisio, Pogba, Vidal, and Tevez. Losing any would kill em.

About the QF, last I checked NONE of those teams made it *passed* their QF the year after. Like I said in the statement you copied. So what's your point? Barely only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.

There's nothing Americans like more than someone who will run himself into the ground for their team.

As with anyone just beginning their fandom of a sport, they don't know much. They've seen highlights of his pace and an assists reel from Seattle and think he's ready for the PL when he clearly isn't, at least for our side.

He's not overly blessed with talent, but his pace is something I think you're under rating. Lennon has been probably a top 3 in the league for quickness/general pace since he was 18/19. Yedlin has that Pace. Now again, I know that's not enough and I'm not saying it is, but he's also underrated with his playing ability. He has a ways to go mentally, but his touch and final ball are not near as bad as people like to say. He's better than Lennon and walker with a final ball.

By tactics do you mean the game or a managers tactics? He knows the game clearly, cause he's been playing it for his entire life. It needs polishing because he reads a little slow, but that's it.

Aldi and lidl are German discounters. They buy regular and premium quality products in bulk which they sell relatively cheaply. The problem with this is that the same things aren't always cheap... So outside of a few specific items they change their stock regularly based on what their buyers can get hold of. So if you have a great pasta bake this week, chances are you can't get it again in 2 weeks... But they'll be a nice lasagne instead.

Basics style products which most of the UK retailers stock are not cheaply bought premium products. They are basic products.... BUT they are part of an established stock line so are available week in, week out, always at a cheap price. They save money at every stage - cheaper containers, older lower quality cuts of meat, cheaper/fewer ingredients etc.

Essentially aldi/lidl are selling taste the difference style products at a discount. However, there are hard limits to how far they can go with this approach... So realistically tesco/asda/sainsburys etc. are all here to stay, and while aldi/lidl might increase their market share, they won't be able to simply push the established UK supermarkets aside because their operations won't scale up. For this reasons I think tesco shares are a good bet. Tesco has an effective UK infrastructure. Worst case they just need to rebrand.

I have a card with ~£800 debt on it and my min. repayment is £25.00 a month. I don't know how that is calculated or even have a good idea of *exactly* how long it would take, but I know my APR when it kicks in is [reasonably large number] so even at a glance I can tell that if I just want to pay off £25 a month it's going to take an age and cost me a lot more.

Over the past few years they've unfortunately become one of my most disliked clubs. I'm sure I'll be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but for those of you who are interested to hear it, I just thought I'd let you guys know why you're falling out of favour with Saints fans. Southampton are an old club, you want to talk about history? We've got it. We've been around for longer than Liverpool even. We didn't win a bunch of stuff in the 80s but for a smaller city than Liverpool our fan base is extremely loyal and well respected. We've seen our club relegated *twice* all the way down to League One, we've patiently endured years under a terrible owner (Lowe), we've seen all our best young players get sold for peanuts (Bale, Walcott, Chamberlain, more recently Lallana, Shaw, Chambers although we at least got decent returns for them) yet we've stayed true to our club and we've generally played fair, raised our own talent, and been a good model of what an English team should be. We have now got rid of our woeful owner and are under much better ownership and management, we have raised our level and are pushing for Champions league. We're the little team that could. We're under no illusions of being a ""big club"" and we know we don't have the money that you, United, Chelsea, City, etc have. When Brendan Rodgers signs three Saints players and says ""They have a choice as a club, they don't have to sell. Maybe Southampton's objectives have changed. They were looking to be a Champions League club, I believe. They obviously wanted to change"" it kinda rubs you the wrong way. When Liverpool fans feel self entitled to other teams' players that they raised up through their academy just because they're a ""big club"" it rubs you the wrong way. When Liverpool make stupidly low offers for world-class players like Clyne, it shows a lack of respect, when Liverpool fans talk about history and speak as if they're owed success just because they won a bunch of stuff in the 80s and (again) are a ""big club"" it gets annoying, and *especially* when Liverpool fans come into a Southampton subreddit and start mass downvoting people just because they don't like what they're saying, well it's really childish and shows complete lack of respect. When a club that's just had not one, but two consecutive seasons in the top half of the table, finishing 7th and now in Europe, have signed more than we've sold this transfer window and are for the first time in many of our *lives* witnessing a stability and success at the club we love, for you to say ""their fans are really starting to get ahead of themselves"", again, rubs us the wrong way. I hope you can understand where we're coming from and I hope I haven't disrespected you guys. I love living here, I've played at the ground a few times, and back in my footballing days, I've had the pleasure of playing with some Liverpool players.

Also I believe it helps bringing in aspects of Germany and German life into the lessons. When talking about going to the shops for example, use German shops rather than British ones. German cars, bands, a few historical figures perhaps. It makes it more of an experience, rather than simply learning the language. Plus those who go on a German exchange will thank you no end when they go. Likewise elements of shared history. There are of course a couple of notable examples from last century, but much else as well - nepolionoc wars, hanseatic league, hannoverians etc. 

If you're any good at linguistics (which I suspect you probably are) a bit of that might be fun. English and German are closely linked languages, so when there are comparisons to make it could be a good idea to make them. For example in Scotland it is the 'kirk' not the 'chuch' when talking about the 'established religious organisation, so that's obviously pretty similar to kirche (?).

The current trend is that women don’t want to study STEM subjects, only about a quarter of workers in science, technology, engineering, and math fields were women in 2011
http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/09/10/2599491/women-stem/

The biggest obstacle is that STEM skills are difficult to learn, almost half of US bachelor’s degree students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009.
  A total of 48 percent of bachelor’s degree students and 69 percent of associate’s degree students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009. Roughly one-half of these leavers switched their major to a non-STEM field, and the rest of them left STEM fields by exiting college before earning a degree or certificate

Even if your child manages to obtain a stem degree there may not even be a stem job available, the shortage of stem workers is a complete myth.

“If there was really a STEM labor market crisis, you’d be seeing very different behaviors from companies, You wouldn’t see companies cutting their retirement contributions, or hiring new workers and giving them worse benefits packages. Instead you would see signing bonuses, you’d see wage increases. You would see these companies really training their incumbent workers.”
“None of those things are observable,” Hira says. “In fact, they’re operating in the opposite way.”

A compelling body of research is now available, from many leading academic researchers and from respected research organizations, No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelors degrees or higher... All have concluded that U.S. higher education produces far more science and engineering graduates annually than there are S&amp;E job openings—the only disagreement is whether it is 100 percent or 200 percent more. Were there to be a genuine shortage at present, there would be evidence of employers raising wage offers to attract the scientists and engineers they want. But the evidence points in the other direction: Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations.  

In the UK the subject with the highest unemployment graduate rate are computer scientists

In the US for every STEM graduate who works in a STEM field there are another three who work in non-STEM fields.

According to Commerce, 7.6 million individuals worked in STEM jobs in 2010, or about 5.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Compared to Retail trade (including food services and drinking places)28,984,100 5,838,400 in warehouse and transportation and 12,596,500 
https://nrf.com/advocacy/retails-impact

If even a small proportion of these 47,419,000 US jobs gets disrupted like the modern shop with self serving using an apple watch, shelf stacking robots, or the restraunt model with cooking robots or driverless car job disruption then STEM vacancies may not be able to grow quickly enough In fact, though, more than 370 000 science and engineering jobs in the United States were lost in 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Even if people could train for better skilled jobs the UK economy shows shift to low-skilled jobs which are generally low paid, every 10 middle-skilled jobs that disappeared in the UK between 1996 and 2008, about 4.5 of the replacement jobs were high-skilled and 5.5 were low-skilled.
New high skilled jobs do not make up a high proportion of employment, 90% of US employees work in occupations that existed 100 years ago. Between 1993 and 2013, 23 million net jobs were created but only 1.3 million were in high tech industries and it remained just 6% of the workforce, the majority of job growth, the U.S. is retail sales, which currently has about 200,000 openings. In the second spot is fast food workers, followed by cashiers and waiter and waitress jobs.

&gt; United have 'a chance to be humiliated/exposed in the' CL

I'm sorry but this is a extremly poor reason. Of course they have a chance to be humiliated, that is the same with literally every team. Look at Barca vs Bayern 2 years ago, look at real vs Dortmund 2 years ago, look at Bayern vs Real last year. Many people would agree that currently these 3 teams are the best in the world right now and all 3 of them got humiliated, that does not change the fact that most/all players would love to play for any of those 3. United are in the CL and that is what matters, Liverpool only have EL. You can't tell me a player would prefer EL because he'd have a chance to be humiliated in the CL.

&gt;. What is LVG's style football? Buy really expensive players and tell them to 'do that thing you were doing before

LVG's style of football is keeping possesion, don't take any stupid risks, try to get a player 1v1 as much as possible etc. What is Rodgers' style of football? Counterattacking like they did last year for some part? Possesion like in his first season and sometimes this season as well? Any player would choose LVG over Rodgers lets be honest. Rodgers has won almost nothing compared to LVG who has won the CL, several league titles etc.

&gt; I can't see UTD winning anything the way they play.

United still have the better players than Liverpool and seeing the way liverpool were last season I'd say their chances are much higher than Liverpool'

Utd was in a transition year this season, no it was not pretty (although at times it was) but it got the job done. Chelsea had the same thing last year, they were missing a couple parts of the puzzle and they fixed it in the summer. If United do the same their chances to win a trophy are pretty high.

&gt; The thing to consider before answering any of them is what kind of football is he's going to be playing? Let's be honest, Liverpool at their best the last few seasons have been a force of nature. They've played jaw-dropping football. UTD at their best? Meh.

That was last season and they did not even win anything with their jaw-dropping football. I think a player would rather win the PL like we did in 2013 than play the footall liverpool played and end up with nothing. Also, apart from last season when was the last time liverpool played ''jaw-dropping'' football?

Yeah it would not be allowed in the UK onshore I would assume. What I meant was that it does go on in offshore facilities and in countries with very poor environmental legislation.

&gt; I assume dehydration is performed at the well head?


It might be near the well head in the case of fracking but it doesn't have to be. the processing facilities could potentially be miles away, with the gas piped to that location.


Honestly, I've only got a few years experience myself (also a Chem Eng grad) so I would take what I say with a pinch of salt but I have done about three front end gas processing projects (no shale).


I'm kind of on the fence with Fracking to be honest. Most of the issues surrounding fracking come from the hydraulic fracturing and potential water contamination which is an issue for the Geologists etc. so I don't really know how real these problems are and how well they could be mitigated. However, the applications were actually blocked due to noise pollution and because it would urbanise the countryside or something. Well, I doubt noise would actually be a problem as I have been to processing facilities and they are actually surprisingly quiet (if properly designed). Urbanising of the countryside seems to be a big elephant in the room: How do you create more jobs without building on some greenbelt land, or more houses?


I think the US is a little bit lax on their environmental and safety policies compared to the UK. Oil and Gas in the US is notoriously more gung ho than the UK. I think this has done damage to the image of fracking and I think it can be done better in the UK.


From a personal perspective if fracking was to really kick off in UK and the rest of Europe similar to the US then it would potentially create some nice work for me (and possibly you) for the rest of my (your) career. Which would be comforting as the North Sea aint doing so well right now.


In terms of local job creation for areas where the fracking is carried out, I'm not sure how significant it would be. Depends on the scale really. Seems like most of the initial wells they are looking to develop will just be pilot scale and unmanned, thus no local jobs really. Most of the engineering will most likely be carried out in Aberdeen or London.


All in all I think they need to prove that water contamination and earth tremors will not be an issue and make sure to design out any noise issues before I feel like I could completely back fracking in onshore UK.


EDIT: I would also like to add that I think taking pleasure in companies like iGas and Quadrilla's share price dropping is extremely insensitive and people who do that should be ashamed. There are plenty of honest people working for these companies that may lose their livelihoods.

Do I condone when people go and downvote other subreddits, no matter how delusional the people there may be? no. Trying to be the bigger and better man in this situation won't work well for you because quite frankly, most fans in that subreddit are completely delusional even thinking our two teams are on par.

Clyne's coming to Liverpool because Liverpool are the better and bigger team who can offer him more of a chance at success than Southampton. If United had gone in for him, chances are he'd have gone there instead because guess what, they are a bigger team than us and can offer him more of a chance at success. That's how football works.

Posting hysterical stuff like, ""We're the future"", when you've had two moderately successful seasons (with no Europa or CL competitions to worry about, not forgetting dropping out of the two trophies you may actually stand a little chance of winning) just rubs me up the wrong way. You have a long way to go and now you're actually in a real competition we'll all be able to see how Southampon do after this season.

In one of our worst seasons, where we played without a striker for the majority, we still could have taken fourth had we not collapsed at the end. We beat you twice, home and away. 

It's the delusional fans on your subreddit (who chances are have only started supporting you in the last two years or so) that have no understanding of the strain extra competitions take on teams. 

I expect Liverpool to finish 5th this season, maybe push for 4th, due to Europa League. - That's realistic.

We finished two points below you and we're on the ascendancy. I've explained that we're not delusional. Most of us are level headed and know we're not a ""big club"" but in terms of actual football, we're both in EL *not* CL. I don't think it's us that's deluded mate.

Outplayed on both, a Coutinho wonder goal (your only shot) saved you and bad refereeing (two penalties not given.) Had we won just one of those two, we'd have finished above you. Sturridge was injured. I get that. Our top goal scorer from last season was out literally all season and our only out and out striker had a massive dip in form after Christmas.

&gt;what made you take up German in the first place?

Didn't have a choice, all students did French and German for the first 3 years of secondary school (Age 11+)
I had the option to continue German for GCSE but decided against it (French was my choice)
There was also an option for Russian (I didn't do this).

&gt;what did you like / didn't like about your German lessons?

I never did well on the Adjectives and adjective endings - der/die/das and this ending on that word etc. I think they should start teaching it at the beginning of the introduction of the course, not wait 3 years and then throw it all at you.

But I did like my teacher - she was very good and we got German gingerbread for Christmas!

&gt;what subject matter should have been more the focus of your lessons? (vocab, pronunciation, grammar, etc.)?

We had lots of vocab &amp; pronunciation but I think the grammar focus would have been good.

&gt;do you think that learning a foreign language such as German has in any way helped you in terms of career choices etc.?

My knowledge of French helped me get a summer job, I think any foreign language is a good thing to learn!

&gt;maybe just share anecdotes / stories from your experiences with foreign language education in UK schools (not necessarily Scotland).

We had lots of visiting French &amp; German teaching students who'd be learning assistants in class - several stayed at my house (the school would ask for a host family) so I enjoyed the extra language practice at home. 

I also have family friends in the South of France and I was sent there one Easter to practice my French during my GSCE's - the father of the family was an ex-French Professor who taught Latin and I learnt more about grammar from him in 2 weeks than 5 years in school!

ElevenReds was this dude who posted to our board all the time who claimed to work for LFC as a youth coach at Melwood. He also said he was a former reserve player at the club and used that and his supposed coaching role in an attempt to impress everyone with personal anecdotes about famous players and also with ""inside"" transfer info. Turns out he lied about 100% of all of it. 

He kept going for so long by sending the mods a couple dubious hiring documents from the club that turned out to be fabricated, as well as (I believe) some additional documentation that purported to show he was the player/coach he claimed to be. To their credit, the mods never endorsed him, and continued to try to find more concrete proof of who he actually was, although they were conspicuously silent about it up to the end.

Anyway, after a while, people who were up to date on his behavior began to get pretty suspicious and started to call him out on some stuff. The mods decided they were worried about fraud and identity theft problems, so they contacted the club directly, and the club said the former player in question was not an employee there. So the mods managed to get said former player's info and contacted him...of course he wasn't ElevenReds, had never heard of Reddit, and was totally freaked out that someone had been assuming his identity for the past year in a popular online forum. The whole saga was equal parts entertaining, embarrassing, sad, and a little scary.

All that is to say, I wouldn't trust OP in r/mcfc, he's probably a dildo who's pulling the exact same shit...this is the sort of stuff ElevenReds used to post when he was trying to build up the narrative that he was under suspicion at the club for being a mole for the papers, I suppose in a misguided attempt to make his shit stink less.",null,0,null,1435586516,null,0,1435586802,0,csmdei8,null,t3_3bc7k6,null,t1_csmdei8,null,t1_csm5w6d,null,null,null,1437437019,null,18,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,18,null

He has been almost exlusively a right winger at Atletico. We have 3 right wingers. Willian who occasionally plays in the centre is a RWer.

Yes it doesnt mean a player can only play that position but in the case of Cuadrado and Arda they only play RW. Turan played no10 YEARS ago before Atletico but he is almost exlusively a RWer.

I'm glad they have to have the same aero, as in my mind the series ""should"" be about furthering the development of electric cars, for which the aeros of racing cars isn't necessarily relevant.  

I guess that battery swapping isn't viewed in the long-term as viable in road-going electric vehicles for some reason, and I guess it's good that whatever is the predominant tech in road-going electrics is mirrored in the racing series, so that these racing developments can be better translated to the real-world.  

Though that raises an interesting point - why aren't swappable batteries viewed as viable in the real-world?  Is it just because it's so much more efficient to design the car and then fill-in whatever shapes are left-over with batteries?  Is it because there'd have to be a ""standard"" battery, and that would limit design? Or, competitors wouldn't be able to agree about the best design?  You'd think that swapping out a battery would be the answer to the most common criticism of limited range due to long charge times.  Presumably a battery could be loaded by a robot. 

I guess ultimately it's optimal for road-electrics to improve capacity and reduce charge times, so perhaps that's why they're going down that road, so to speak.  Any implementation of swappable batteries is likely to be expensive and if battery technology (charge times and capacity) really progresses then the swapping technology will be redundant.

Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has sent astray? And he whom Allah sends astray - never will you find for him a way [of guidance].

&gt;They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.

&gt;Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting their own people. And if Allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them.

&gt; This paper considers the feasibility of managing aviation passenger demand through a reformed taxation regime for flights. Specifically, it is supposed that Air Passenger Duty (APD) be repealed and replaced by a Frequent Flyer Levy (FFL), which would vary depending on the number of previous flights taken by an individual.

&gt; The research question is what such a tax regime should look like in order to achieve four goals: (i) prevent passenger demand from increasing more than 60% by 2050, as recommended by the Committee on Climate Change; (ii) be revenue neutral to the exchequer; (iii) obviate the need for new runway capacity; and (iv) reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with a low probability of &gt; 2°C warming.

&gt; The potential impact on businesses is also considered. It is found that a progressive tax on frequent flying could play a significant role in restraining demand for flights, while at the same time tending to distribute those flights more equally across the income spectrum.

Lacazette is currently on under £30k a week (I believe), so if we offered him £90k a week, and sold him the plan that we'll be in the CL after next season and put in a big buy-out clause so that he can move on if he doesn't like the club after a year/18 months then I think if we were (at the point we had a bid accepted) the only club to have a bid accepted we could convince the player that we're a worthy club and have shit wrapped up before anybody else gets the chance.

Firmino could have held out and potentially got a transfer to United who would have offered more wages and CL football, but to play in the premier league itself, and obviously tripling your wages, might be enough to secure good players these days.

The basic income would give those who can't work a decent income and put them on a level with minimum wage workers, you could do away with most instances of free prescriptions, subsidised childcare, public transport and leisure activities to name but a few things. With a fair, livable basic income (I reckon £10 - 12k), you might also be able to do away with housing benefit for bedsits, studios and social housing.

For those who can work, but can't find jobs, you have security and a release from the bullying culture of JSA and the stigma of being ""on benefits"". You can hunt for jobs you're actually qualified in, knowing you've got the time and freedom to pick and choose and your family won't starve. 

The job market becomes a seller's market instead of the buyer's market it is now. Businesses will find themselves having to entice and reward staff and offer better benefits than they could get by staying on basic income - or they will simply fail to recruit anyone at all.

The club I have lived every single minute for since joining in July 2004, the club in which I thought I'd hang my gloves and boots one day and finish my career. But life doesn't always tum out the way you think it will. 
Since 2004 it has been an incredible journey with so many highs and not many lows. We have managed to win every single English trophy as well as the Europa League and the biggest of all -Champions League. Looking back at all the achievements, including our first ever league double in 2010, back to back titles in 2005 and 2006, and multiple EPL and FA cup wins, I couldn't be more proud!! As a team we made history together!! 
Last summer, things changed and I understood I was no longer the 1st choice keeper but I fell it was not the right time for me to go. During the season it became clear that my situation would not improve and as I know I am not at the stage of my career where I want to be on the bench. I made my decision to move on and look for new challenges. 
The limited playing time gave me the chance to refresh and rest mentally as well as make me realise just how much I enjoy playing football at the highest level. because I missed it badly every game day I was not involved. I have the same commitment to football, the same motivation and the same hunger for success as I had at the beginning of my career and I love the challenges brought by the top quality players you face while playing the Premier League - simply the best and the most challenging league in the world. 
That's why I spoke to Mr. Abramovich about me staying in the Premier League and I'd like to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his support in this matter. It means so much to me because without him Chelsea Football Club would not be where it is now. He deserves huge credit for what he has done for the club and for all of us. 
I would like to personally thank everybody involved with Chelsea Football Club for their support - all the players, staff, managers and all the coaching staff I have had the pleasure of working with over the years. Without them it would have been impossible for us to have achieved such success. 
But most important of all a huge thank you goes to all the Chelsea fans I did everything for you and you gave me your love back. I'll never forget it. It will stay with me forever. We will meet again but this time I will be in the other goal - I hope you will remember our history and understand it is time for me to begin a new adventure. 
I wish everybody at Chelsea Football Club all the best for the new season and for the future. Thank you for an incredible 11 years

Now they're being sanctions which hurts their daily life and the republican party wants to turn them into a Iraq 2.0

From this point of view a lot of muslims will feel the west keeps attacking them and some will join extremist group in revenge look at bin ladens open letter http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver

As for the first question: Why are we fighting and opposing you? The answer is very simple: 

(1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us. 

a) You attacked us in Palestine: 

(i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.",null,0,null,1435588653,null,0,1435588863,0,csmeh8x,null,t3_3bi8ly,null,t1_csmeh8x,null,t1_csme5w5,null,null,null,1437437600,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Heathrow was built at a time when the area was on the periphery of London in a semi-rural area. Now there has been an increase in density within the area and the land around it has also become valuable, so Heathrow no longer fits its purpose, as nice as it is. And how can we expect Heathrow to future serve the UK's needs if it's blocked off by NIMBYs?

In order for London to grow, it needs a larger airport that can handle greater capacity with little need for noise and time regulation (we have ridiculous quotas). IIRC, Heathrow also runs at near 99% capacity. And not to mention all of the pollution associated with the residential areas nearby which has impacts on health. It's far better to build Boris Island (despite the high initial cost) then reapporpriate Heathrow into a second city centre, by building skyscrapers with a Manhattan style skyline with affordable apartments and office spaces, or a business/R&amp;D cluster.

In a ideal world that is true. This is the real world however and players care a lot about how much money they make which is logical considering they only do this for 15-20 years.

&gt; I don't think a UTD fan should be comparing themselves with the Barca/Dortmund/Bayern examples you gave. They were far superior teams. There's simply a much greater risk of CL mediocrity at UTD. (Although granted, to be part of it at all is good).

I was not comparing, I was giving examples that literally every team can get humiliated and that includes the best of the best teams. 

&gt; Rodger's style is way more promising/progressive than LVG's

Arguable, Rodger's style last season was absolutly awful, apart from last season he has proved fuck all at Liverpool. Only thing he has proven apart from last year is that Liverpool is not only extremly boring but they also don't get results. United was boring but they got results and that is what matters. 

&gt; A good test for this is to imagine Rodgers in charge of UTD's ridiculously expensive team. You just know he would do better.

So your argument is me imaginening Rodgers being in charge of United and knowing (how is that even possible?) that he would do better? That makes no sense. I'll try to use facts instead of imaginening things.

The amazing trophy total of Brendan Rodgers (1):

IMO we need to return all economic migrants from outside the EU home (they should help build their country rather than seeking an easier life here IMO) by setting up (costly) processing centers all over the Med and have some sort of quota/choice system for the refugee's that get to Europe. So the migrants get to choose which country they go to up until a cap, and then if the cap is reached they have to go to their second/third/fourth choice country. This allows those that speak/know about French/English/German/Italian to have the chance to go to France/Britain/Germany/Italy whilst also setting a ""migrant cap"" per country per month/year for each country to decide upon (together).

null,false,MICOTINATE,null,null,null,"I know more about Jenkinson than Soares but he was excellent for West Ham last season, not as good Clyne but definitely better than Bertrand played for Aston Villa the season before he came to us and look how that worked out.

&gt;Only if we keep selling players like Clyne and Schneiderlin

That's something that can't be helped, Clyne was going to run down his contract and leave for free and there was no way Schneiderlin was going to sign another contract. You say ""look at our finances"" like we're wealthy, we're doing ok but all of our transfer spending is funded by player sales. We're not close to the position where we can buy top players without selling, our revenue is dwarfed by the teams we're trying to compete with:



Team   |   Turnover (£)  |  Matchday (£)  | TV (£) | Retail &amp; Commercial (£) | 
------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|----|----|----
Chelsea  |  324m   |  71m  |  140m | 114m |
Man City  |   347m   |   47m  |  133m | 166m | 
Arsenal  |   304m  |   100m  | 121m | 77m |
Man United   |  433m   |   108m  |  136m | 189m | 
Spurs   |   181m   |   35m  |  90m | 56m | 
Liverpool   |  256m   |   51m  | 101m | 104m | 
Southampton  |  106m   |   17m  | 79m | 9m | 

If the club and the squad is going to continue improving we're going to need to buy players, and financially speaking we're not in the position to take the financial hit of letting people go on free transfers. Selling players like Clyne to Liverpool I agree is overall detrimental but we don't have a say in who bids for our players, so if the choice is sell him to Liverpool for £12m now or let him go there for free in a years time then selling is the best choice because it's the only option that gives us the funds to replace him. We can demand £20m+ all we want but Liverpool will eventually just walk away and Clyne leaves a year later anyway.

&gt;We're a club on the ascendancy, yes Liverpool are a bigger club than us, but we're on the up and I don't think I can say the same for them

I totally agree with you on this, but we've got different ideas about how long it'll take for us to be in the same weight class as them and Spurs. Financially speaking we're 11th in the league, squad wise last season no one expected us to do as well as we did but we played like a team that was more than the sum of its parts. We overachieved last season and even at that we scraped into the europa league qualifying round by virtue of Arsenal and Chelsea winning the cups. If the cups went differently we finish 2 places outside of Europe. Looking at last season table sure it looks close but in off the pitch terms there's a big gulf, that £106m turnover is a 30m increase over last season. So even if we keep up that rate of growth it'll take 5 years to catch up to Liverpool and that's under the unrealistic assumption that they don't do some growing themselves. 

I think the club can keep growing, after next season our kit deal with Adidas (which was negotiated the season after we got promoted) and our Veho sponsorship both end I think. Another good showing in the league and a decent run in the Europa League (fingers crossed we can qualify again) will leave us in an excellent spot to negotiate better contracts which will do wonders for our commercial income. Europa league will also bump the TV money a little bit, plus our fixture schedule might mean we get more of our domestic games televised as well.

&gt;I would not be surprised if we finish about them this season

I wouldn't be surprised if we're close to them either, but getting 5th and guaranteed europe is a different challenge entirely. Liverpool and Spurs are the teams we're chasing right now, and they themselves are chasing the top 4. Next season we're going to have Swansea right up our arse again, probably Everton as well, Stoke and West Ham won't be far behind either. So the reason I say Liverpool are more likely to get europe (and therefore why Clyne would want to throw his lot in with them instead of us) is because we could have a season just as good as the one we just had and not get Europe. We could finish 6 points better off and potentially still not get europe, but we could finish 6 points worse off and wind up 10th. 

In the mean time bigger clubs will keep trying to buy our players and our players will keep wanting to leave for bigger clubs. While that continues the big teams can afford to buy players who are proven at a higher level and we will have to keep taking gambles and 'discovering' talent.

&gt;We've got Cedric Soares which I'm just hoping and praying can perform at least close to the level Clyne could

This is basically what it all boils down to, and why I've rambled on about finances for so long. Until we can compete financially with Liverpool and Spurs they will be able to buy players they *know* will play well and we will have to keep replacing squad members with players we *think* or *hope* will play well.",null,0,null,1435589421,null,0,false,0,csmew1f,null,t3_3b6d0g,null,t1_csmew1f,null,t1_csmaumf,null,null,null,1437437787,null,1,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,1,null

No it's not. It was about being pro equality; pro equal expression. A right can not be a privilege. That's self refuting. Privilege isn't equality. The movement was initially, unknowingly at best, gay privilege. Not gay equality.

UKIP were against legislation which would put LGBT expression above religious. UKIP fought as they recognised other minorities besides LGBT.

The legislature afforded compromise by putting both forms of expression on equal footing, which is why UKIP reviewed their stance and will not repeal.

The difficult of the mathematics is not in the technical details, but the *intuition* and the *Application* of the math generally.

You should be fluent in each model in **3 languages** mathematical,  written, and algebraic, be able to interchange between all 3 under pressure. Understanding the: direction, slope of each line in each model.

I thought this would never happen but it's time for me to say goodbye to Chelsea Football Club. The club i have lived every single minute for since joining in July 2004, the club in which i though i would hang my gloves and boots one day and finish my career but life doesn't always turn out the way you think it will.

Since 2004 it has been an incredible journey with so many highs and not many lows. We have managed to win every single English trophy as well as the Europa league and the biggest of all, the Champions league. looking back at all the achievements, including our first ever league double in 2005 and 2006 and multiple EPL and FA cup wins, i couldn't be more proud!! As a team we made history together!!

Last summer things changed and i understood i was no longer 1st choice keeper but i felt it was not the right time for me to go. During the season it became clear my situation would not improve and as i know I am not at the stage of my career where i want to be on the bench, i made my decision to move and look for new challenges.

the limited playing time gave me the chance to refresh and rest mentally as well as make me realize just how much i love playing football at the highest level because i missed it badly every game day i was not involved. i have the same commitment to football, the same motivation and the same hunger for success i had at the beginning of my career and i love challenges brought by top quality players you face while in the Premier league- simply the best and most challenging league in the world.

That is why i spoke to Mr. Abramovich about me staying the in Premier league and i would like to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his support in this matter. it means so much to me because without him Chelsea Football Club would not be where it is now. He deserves huge credit for what he has done for the club and for all of us.

i would like to personally thank everyone involved with Chelsea Football Club for their support- all the players, staff, managers and coaching staff i have had the pleasure working with over the years. Without them it would have been impossible for us to have achieved such success.

But most important of all- a huge thank you goes to all Chelsea fans. I did everything for you and you gave me your love back. i'll never forget it.it will stay with me forever, we will meet again but this time i will be in the other goal- i hope you will remember our history and understand it is time for me to begin a new adventure.

I wish everyone at Chelsea Football Club all the best for the new season and for the future. Thank you for an incredible 11 years.

So in the same timespan as others, I had to learn three languages simultaneously. This was all compulsory up to year 9, I only kept French after that to GCSE level. 

So I was forced into learning German. I didn't like the teacher at all which didn't help matters, and found it didn't come as naturally as French. I am not sure why, as it is more similar to English but I suppose it is less attractive and has less of a ""flow"" than French. I also considered it would be less useful, as I was unlikely to travel to Germany but could envisage trips and holidays to France (thinking long term!). The balance of the focus was alright, it was mainly conversational and useful but with enough of the tedious grammar to keep you straight. All language tuition was like that really.

&gt;I can't overstate this: football teams rotate their personnel. They have to. Players need to be rested to remain fresh.

They don't that much though. Look at Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea this season, they barely rotated. Terry and Ivanovic for example played every single minute of the BPL this season, Hazard missed only 60 minutes... Matic missed 300 minutes, Cahill 400 etc. Similar in the CL, those players also played almost every minute in that competition too.

Barcelona had Neymar, Messi, Suarez who played almost every minute past about January/February.. they only really rotated their old players like Xavi

Where does the power come from on calm evenings with no wind?

You can't answer that question, because *there is no good answer.* Tidal power is totally unproven at scale. Geothermal is totally unproven in the UK. Batteries are totally unproven at scale.

We actually already subsidise solar + wind installations a lot, and I continue to support this push despite the fact that it's very expensive for consumers, and WILL continue to push up electricity bills. But we *also* need to maintain gas power stations for calm evenings. This is a fact. The only alternatives are coal (which is worse for the environment) or nuclear (which is mega, mega expensive). I'd actually be all for nuclear too, but the french seemingly have it locked up tight at EU level, so we simply can't get decent plants for a decent price.

So the only real question is: If we're not going to frack for gas ourselves, where are we going to get it? Imported LNG from the US or Qatar is less environmentally friendly and much more expensive.

Basic income would replace pensions, welfare and would be the minimum wage. I'm not advocating that the government just hands everyone over 18 inthe UK twelve grand. The basic income is for those who have no other income, or those working low waged jobs. Anyone earning more than £12k wouldn't get it. I think that's logical and reasonable, don't you? Employers have to pay everyone a £12k minimum, but that isn't going to affect the government figures, is it?

In three years' time there will be 2.5million pensioners. At £12k each per year, that's £30bn.

There's roughly 3.3million people claiming disability benefits. That's another ~£40bn.

1.8million unemployed? That's £22bn.

So far, we're still well under £100bn and have replaced most of a welfare bill that currently comes to more than £200bn.

Let's speculate that with the basic income in place, we can do away with the state pension, most of housing benefit, child benefit, tax credits altogether and disability benefits, and we make the basic income taxable...

Even with admin costs factored in, you've made a gigantic saving and made millions of people's lives better in one fell swoop.

null,false,askoorb,null,null,null,"Hi di hi,

I have had a close family member and a friend move countries, and have learnt quite a bit about what practical problems they ran into as a result.

I am more than happy to give you some pointers on practical issues to get you set up in the UK if you want.  Just drop me a PM on reddit.

I will first try to cover boring practical stuff like how to open a bank account, sort out your taxes etc before going onto how to find software engineering jobs in the UK.

Right, first off, where in the UK are you moving? Just like in the US different states work differently, in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland things are different?  A city name would be best but if you uncomfortable with that a country will do.  If you have no idea where you will be going or where you will be sleeping when you get off the plane say that too.

Now, four UK websites that are really useful and cover most things you need to know in a reliable way:

http://www.moneysavingexpert.com.  Not an official government site, but an absolute godsend.  Go read and learn everything on that site and make sure you sign up for the weekly email.

http://www.gov.uk.  The official website of HM Government.  The place to find government services and information.

http://www.nhs.uk.  The official website of the NHS in England.  Gives details on services, health conditions, drugs, coverages etc.

https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk.  An official charity who provide information and advice on pretty much everything.  As well as a website they have a helpline and local branches you can go to speak to an advisor.  Their services are totally free.

Three key telephone numbers you need to memorise in the UK:

999 – Emergency services, like 911, but you connect to an operator first, you tell the operator who you want from Fire, Police, Ambulance, HM Coastguard, Mountain Rescue and Cave Rescue.  You are then connected.  112 also redirects to 999 and works everywhere in the EU.  You can normally dial 999 even if you have no mobile signal, as under the GSM standard if you are out of range of your network you will “emergency roam” to any available network.

111 – NHS 111.  24 NHS non-emergency number.  Free to call.  Call if you urgently need medical help or advice but it's not a life-threatening situation, you don't know who to call or you need health information or reassurance about what to do next.  If it turns out it to be an emergency they are linked into ambulance dispatch so can send help without having to ring anyone else.

101 – 24 hour police non-emergency.  15p per call.  To contact the police anytime it’s not an emergency.

OK.  So, you’ve arrived in the UK.  What the heck od you do now?  You need a bank account, but no bank will let you open an account without proof of address.  How do you get that?

**Step 1:**  Register with the local council for council tax and voting (in the UK credit checks involve the electoral register so you will need to register as an EU citizen if you ever want credit).  Whilst you are supposed to be able to do this online, you will not be able to as you are so new in the country.  Turn up at your town hall in person and ask to:
•	Be issued with a council tax bill and
•	Be added to the electoral register – request not to be added to the ‘open’ or ‘edited’ register as this is used for junk mail.
You now have a council tax bill to use as proof of address.

**Step 2:** Get a mobile (cell) phone.  If you have a GSM phone and you can unlock it (perfectly legal in the UK) great, you don’t need to buy a new phone.  There is a great guide to unlocking phones at https://www.giffgaff.com/unlock.  To start with, get a prepaid plan, you don’t want to get yourself into an overpriced 24 month contract straight off the plane.  See http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/phones/mobile-phone-cost-cutting#payg for cheap deals.  You are probably going to want GiffGaff or Three to begin with.  If you eventually move network or to a contract you can port your number free of charge.  If you need a SIM card ready and waiting in the UK when you arrive give me a shout and I can arrange for one to be waiting at a post office in the airport for you to pick up so you can be ready to go straight off the plane.

**Step 3:** Take your passport and council tax bill (and any other documents with your address on) to a bank or building society to open a current account.  In the UK chequing accounts are called current accounts.  Generally, in credit banking is free here, and some banks even pay you to be a customer.  However, you are probably after very good service and cheap foreign transactions (so you can spend in dollars without crying at the fees).  We also have organisations called Building Societies, which are fairly similar to US credit unions.  Your best bet is likely to be opening a FlexAccount with Nationwide Building Society, as they:
•	Are always near the top of customer service polls
•	Have really great online and mobile banking.
•	Offer free branch access.
•	Only charge a 2% fee on overseas transactions over the Visa corporate exchange rate.
•	Give free EU travel insurance, upgradable to worldwide (inc USA and Canada) for £40 a year.
Details are at http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexaccount/features-and-benefits so take a look.  Make sure you read the ID guidelines at http://www.nationwide.co.uk/support/support-articles/manage-your-account/proving-your-identity and open your account in a Branch (you don’t have any credit history so online applications will fail everywhere).  Remember you will need to prove your overseas address history so bring recent (within 6 months) utility bills and bank statements and your driver’s licence.

**Step 4:** The NHS.  Your eligibility for NHS services to solely based on you being ‘ordinarily resident’ in England.  No other requirement applies.  The NHS works a bit like an HMO back in the states, in that for most non-emergency matters you go see a General Practitioner (GP), and if necessary they refer you on.  You can choose pretty much any GP in the country, and for a referral, you can pick any provider in England (or technically the EU if you really want to go to Romania for that knee op).  Most people don’t bother asking to exercise their right to choice and simply default to the nearest GP and hospital, but you can choose if you want.  To register with the NHS you will need to register with a GP.  Go to http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4 and type in your postcode.  Ignore the “accepting new patients” box as it is always out of date but ring and ask.  If you can’t be bothered looking, or are having difficulty finding one who will take you ring your NHS England Area Team and ask them to allocate you a GP (they are legally required to), they can also find you an NHS dentist.  Ring them on the number at http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Area-Team/LocationSearch/1839.  Shortly after registration you will be sent your NHS Number.  Keep that number with you and provide it if you ever need to contact the NHS.

**Step 4.1** Get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).  You are covered elsewhere in the EU to the same degree as a local resident in that country, but only if you have an EHIC, otherwise you are paying privately.  Apply at http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/EHIC/Pages/about-the-ehic.aspx now, rather than just before you get on a plane as it will take a few weeks to process an application for someone who was not born here.

**Step 5:** Get a National Insurance Number (NINO).  NINOs are the UK equivalent of the SSN.  Without one you are going to struggle to get paid.  As soon as you get into the UK ring the number at https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number to apply over the phone.

**Step 6:** Sort out your utilities.  Now that you have a current account you can get your salary paid in and pay your bills by Direct Debit (similar to autopay but with more protections and bigger discounts from suppliers).  Follow the guides at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/ to find cheap suppliers for Gas and Electricity as in the UK the market has been deregulated and you have a choice.

**Step 7:** Phones, TV and Broadband.  You have a choice of all three.  Be aware that you may not need to actually pay for a TV subscription (most people don’t) but if you want to watch any TV live (not catch up) you will need a TV Licence or you may get a £1,000 fine.  Details at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/tv-licence.  For broadband you are likely to end up with a landline as well (they tend to be bundled here).  See http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/phones/cheap-broadband for good deals and remember that the UK is way cheaper than the US when it comes to broadband if you shop around.

**Step 8:** Driving licence.  For some reason the US never signed an agreement with the UK for US driving licences to be convertible into a UK one (many other countries did, including Canada).  Use the tool at https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence to see how long you can use your US licence for.  Apply at https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence pretty early on so you have enough time to go through your theory and practical tests before your US licence expires.  Be aware that you may struggle to get car insurance at a sensible price without an EU licence, and that driving without insurance is an offence – even leaving your car uninsured and not driving it leads to an automatic fine through the post, so don’t drive uninsured.  You will also need to register your car when if buy one and pay an annual vehicle tax based on how polluting the vehicle is (don’t worry, it’s not outrageous).

Taxes
Most people pay:
Income Tax
National Insurance
Council Tax
Value Added Tax
As their main taxes. In the UK, the tax year runs from 6th April to 5th April.

The UK has a double taxation treaty with the US, that means that, although you have to complete a US tax return, you can count UK taxes paid as covering your US federal taxes.  If you paid more UK tax that you would in the US on the same income, you pay no US tax.

**Income Tax** is normally taken automatically from your pay by your employer through Pay As You Earn and most people do not have to complete a tax return at the end of the year if the amount of tax taken was wrong you get a refund automatically.

**National Insurance** looks like a tax but technically isn’t.  It covers the old age State Pension and some unemployment benefits.  The UK has a social security treaty with the US that means that you can claim any UK state pension entitlement in the US, or if you stay in the UK for less than two years you can get a refund of all NI paid.  So you are going to get something back for your NI contributions!

**Council Tax** is the local tax in the UK, covering roads schools bin collections etc, along with police and fire services.  The rate is broadly based on how expensive your house or flat is, and is paid by the occupier rather than the owner.  There are deductions and rebates if you live alone or are on a low income.

**Value Added Tax (VAT)** is the EU version of sales tax.  Loads of stuff is totally exempt (for example most of your food), but where it is charged the rate can be as high as £20% in some cases.  Importantly though in the UK the price you see is the price you pay, if something has a £1 price sticker it is either £1 and VAT exempt, or £1 after VAT has been added.


Now, as far as jobs go, this all depends on where about you intend to live and if you have a house lined up already.  For a new graduate entering a new Software Development in a small business position outside London £28,000 is a decent guide (http://www.tpp-uk.com/job/software-developer-2).  There is no such thing as only being allowed to use the NHS if you work a certain number of hours or anything ridiculous like that.  Have a read of some of your basic rights at work (https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/rights-at-work/basic-rights-at-work/), it’s nothing like the US.

Let me know if this is ay use, I knocked it out quickly without proof reading, but if you want anything else (like how to find somewhere to live), clarification or something else, let me know!",null,0,null,1435591932,null,0,false,0,csmgbi4,null,t3_3agxm6,null,t1_csmgbi4,null,t1_csmgazk,null,null,null,1437438714,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

For millions of people, that's the most tangible hope they'll have of breaking out of a life in low-pay, low-prestige jobs (or no job at all). We're soaked in a culture that presents extreme material wealth some sort of immanent apotheosis The Lottery gives some small hope that this is achievable.

It forms a secular replacement for religion, offering hope of salvation in a purely material manner. You could extend that view to the Marxist idea that this has been deliberately introduced by the ruling classes as one tool (of many) to control the population by offering a minuscule chance of escaping the proletariat, thus suppressing revolutionary impulses; replacing religion as the ""opium of the people"". Given that, the charitable component becomes another clever mechanism, it means the number of people who are made wealthy by the lottery can be reduced, keeping the ruling elite small, because there are other incentives to play.

On the other hand, and with less conspiracy theory, you can see it simply as an informed capitalist transaction of exchanging money for hope. There is a market demand for hope, not many people are selling, so the Lottery is a useful supplier.

null,false,burgleurgle,null,null,null,"&gt;what made you take up German in the first place?

The main foreign language taught at my school was French. Those of us who were doing well in French were made to take German (we had no choice) in year 9 for at least one year, then we could decide if we wanted to continue with it through GCSE. I only did it for the one year as I didn't really like learning languages at the time (although I now study languages as a hobby!).

&gt;what did you like / didn't like about your German lessons?

I just plain didn't like learning languages at that time of my life. I was an able student so in most other classes I understood everything very quickly, but in language classes this wasn't the case.

And I was always terrified of getting something wrong whenever I had to speak or answer a question, since a foreign language is such a huge thing it's so easy to make small mistakes and I hated making even really small mistakes. I didn't realise that making mistakes is part of how you learn a language, I viewed mistakes as a bad thing, rather than as a good learning opportunity.

As for good things, I really enjoyed learning about how life in France/Germany/wherever is different than life in the UK. Just learning a language without any context of the culture, country, people, history etc is very boring and abstract. It felt a lot more alive and exciting and interesting when I felt like I was leaning more than just a language.

&gt;what subject matter should have been more the focus of your lessons? (vocab, pronunciation, grammar, etc.)?

I got a pretty well-rounded education in all three (for the whole one year that I studied it...).

&gt;do you think that learning a foreign language such as German has in any way helped you in terms of career choices etc.?

Foreign languages - yes. German - no, because I've forgotten almost all of it and never needed to use it.

&gt;Some of us were disappointed but at the end of it all we realised we’d had a good season having finished fifth in the league and reached a cup final as well. We had a new Head Coach in his first year at the Club and we’ve been adapting to his new way of working and style of play.

&gt;**Your personal highlight of the season?**

&gt;The win against Chelsea in the league on New Year’s Day, but also the Capital One Cup Final against them. Even though we lost, it was still an amazing experience to play at Wembley in a big final like that.

&gt;**Plans for the summer?**

&gt;Resting for a few days, although I don’t really allow myself to rest that much to be honest! The coaches gave us a summer programme to work on but I told them I wouldn’t need it because I’m staying fit anyway. I plan to train even harder and come back stronger.

&gt;**Thoughts on pre-season?** 

&gt;It’s a tough part of the year but it’s really important. The fitness of the team is vital – you can see how it helped us in a few games last season with the team never giving up and fighting to the end. That won us a lot of points. Pre-season is about working hard and the players getting ready for the new campaign.

&gt;**Hopes for next season?**

You also must remember in India there is female infanticide and there are some (not a lot) indian muslims who believe Islam helped decrease female infanticide as the quran says burying daughters is wrong. 

It reminds me of a book by a Palestinain christian academic called Edward Said who in 1981 wrote a book about western coverage of islam https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_Islam

Said refers to the media's ability to control and filter information as an 'invisible screen', releasing what it wants people to know and blacking out what it does not want them to know. In the age of information, Said argues, it is the media that interprets and filters information—and Said claims that the media has determined very selectively what Westerners should and should not know about Islam and the Muslim world. Islam is portrayed as oppressive (women in Hijab); outmoded (hanging, beheading and stoning to death); anti-intellectualist (book burning); restrictive (bans on post- and extramarital affairs, alcohol and gambling); extremist (focusing on Algeria, Lebanon and of course Egypt); backward (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan); the cause of worldwide conflict (Palestine, Kashmir and Indonesia); and dangerous (Turkey and Iran).

The modern Western media, says Said, does not want people to know that in Islam both men and women are equal; that Islam is tough on crime and the causes of crime; that Islam is a religion of knowledge par excellence; that Islam is a religion of strong ethical principles and a firm moral code; that socially Islam stands for equality and brotherhood; that politically Islam stands for unity and humane governance; that economically Islam stands for justice and fairness; and that Islam is at once a profoundly spiritual and a very practical religion. Said claims that untruth and falsehood about Islam and the Muslim world are consistently propagated in the media, in the name of objectivity, liberalism, freedom, democracy and ‘progress’",null,0,null,1435592759,null,0,false,0,csmgt7v,null,t3_3bi8ly,null,t1_csmgt7v,null,t1_csmgjrg,null,null,null,1437439040,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

I take advice from the scientists who have told me so. Where is your advice coming from?

&gt;We don't need to frack no matter what you read in the papers.

We don't NEED to frack. But if we don't do, energy bills will rise, taxes will rise (more) and the UK will be less competitive on the global stage. 

&gt;Let's say the companies who have so juch invested in fossil fuels (""we have so much money tied up in it our only option is to dsperately find new ways of getting it and paying politicians and organisations to say it's fine!"") decided to invest in solar, wind and waves.

Who are you talking about here?

&gt;If the civillians of the world said ""no, I'll take my energy from renewable thanks"" then we'd be in a new fucking age of renewable energy by now.

No we wouldn't, for the reasons I just gave you. WE DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO GO PURE RENEWABLE. THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT EXIST. Do you understand what I'm saying?

&gt;fucking shit up for a little profit or ""we need energy RIGHT NOW MAN"" and excusing the fact that companies PAY THE PEOPLE WHO RUN YOUR COUNTRY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS PERFECTLY OKAY

No. Independent studies have been done, and concluded that fracking for gas is safe as long as done properly. We have had an oil + gas industry in the UK decades with no major incidents, so clearly we can do this properly. Where are you getting YOUR information from eh?

&gt;If it's such a saviour and basically a good idea, why do they need to PAY PEOPLE to support them?

If so, why would someone risk such a cool job for internet popularity? Makes no fucking sense. I'd say it's more than a 90% chance he's 100% bullshit. 

Edit: right, so I googled him real quick...he's all over social media claiming to be an ""advertising CEO"". Honestly, even if you believe that, the guy has some sort of complex. His personal website is basically just him bragging about his claimed salary of over 500k. I'm assuming based on a couple of his more recent posts and the version of himself that he's projecting elsewhere online that he wants you to believe he's a well-off marketing professional who lives in a posh part of Manchester and is neighbors with some footballers. I'm also guessing that he'd have you believe that his connection to the club is some friend/neighbor who is on the MCFC executive staff and is privy to insider transfer info. 

I still don't believe him. Let's assume for a second that ""Jeremy Parnaby"" is even a real person, why would he jeopardize a close friendship by blabbing every bit of transfer gossip his friend laid on him, under his *real name*? The only answer is that he's got some sort of attention-whoring compulsion that forces him to seek validation from everyone he's able to be in contact with, both online and in real life. I'm fairly convinced this is undoubtedly the case no matter how much of his story is true. 

Now let's say he is who he says he is, and his connection is real...why would that person still be telling him anything after the first damn time he broke something online? Clubs are extremely conscious of leaks like this, and this guy is out posting info under his *supposed* real name. After the Mangala thing, don't you think someone at City would go ""hey, Geoff, ain't that your idiot friend Jeremy who leaked the completion of the Mangala deal 48 hours in advance? Yeah, he posted it in a reddit forum under his *actual name*. How bout you never talk to that guy again if you want to keep your board seat?"" That'd almost certainly be the end of it, if the relationship were real to begin with.

Barca play a 4-3-3. It's not too shabby, I think you'll agree. Now I watched them on sky last night (it was a replay of El Classico) and they track back, they're pacey, they're fast, they out muscle players, and they have Messi. But anyway I don't think our team could do that. The 3 man midfield would leave me petrified before a match because our forward 3 don't have the defensive ability that we would need. Aguero could do Suarez's job, Silva maybe on the left where Neymar plays, Bony on the right (or Aguero on the right and Bony central) would leave me feeling confident going forward but not on the back foot. 3 man midfield - Yaya, Ferna, Navas, doesn't make me too reassured, despite that being 3 solid players. Pogba (I wish!), Yaya, Fernandinho sounds better but we'd need that youngster from Juve for sure. The usual back 4 is fine in my eyes.

He will probably improve his defending and positioning with experience, but in no way are those two things guarantees.

-He really is not asked to do that much. Everybody loves to harp on Dembele for getting trapped while trying to attack, but at least he is up there. Bentaleb has made a few decent runs, but he rarely seems to be making any killer passes/dribbles that puts us in a position to score. Defensively, playing next to Mason is surely tough, but Bentaleb is far from a wall back there. With that said, I do like the aggression he shows.

I like Bentaleb, but I really do think we need to take off our Spurs tinted glasses for a minute and be objective. He is a good player that might become a consistent first teamer.

It's also important to note that arab societies covered with hair before islam came into existence so it could be seen as cultural. The Quran only says dress modestly and the verse for covering hair is really vague so it depends on interpretation so arab societies may believe hijab is modesty while indian muslim societies may feel it's not part of islam but can be worn my women if they want to.

I guess a lot of that housing is for safety.  Obviously with the racing car it's going to need to withstand high speed impact.

I thought maybe they could use some sort of trolley jack to get it in and out. 

But you just know that there's going to be a trade-off between speed of replacement and safety of fitting.  And that at some point a battery is going to fall out because there's a time pressure on the mechanics to get the thing in.  Just in the same way that there have been occasional refuelling accidents (Schumacher up in flames comes to mind).

 Firstly, you have the ignorance of the caller, who doesn't seem to grasp the huge cultural and theological diversity within Islam. Secondly, Islam is not 'hierarchical' like most Christian denominations, and their are no official 'Popes' or 'Queens' to make the statement. But leaving that aside, there have been a huge number of statements from Islamic groups on social media, condemning the attack and distancing themselves from the attacker's beliefs. Maybe it's the mainstream media who should be apologising, for not giving these representatives a larger stage? Then you have the racist angle of the callers request.

I agree with you that Labour has been *chasing the vote* far too much in recent years instead of making a positive vision for the country.  But considering we've had Red Ed leadership for the last 5 years, not sure how you can blame ""Blue Labour"" for electoral failure. 

Again, I ask you to stop calling labour supporters 'tory' and stop calling them 'blue labour. I don't call you 'communists' or a 'stalinists' just because we disagree on policy.

It's not Tory (or Blue Labour) to suggest we need to be economically credible. On the contrary, it's the reason we were rejected by the electorate. We need to get this right. This will take tough decisions.  Whilst we weren't to blame for the economic crisis, the Tories had a better idea than us on how to fix it. As a starter we should support the governments position on balancing the books — eliminating the deficit. We should push the Tories hard on this and hold them to it. Then and only then will we have the credibility to start question government spending changes in all areas. Only then can will we have the authority to challenge their state cutting agenda.

I'd like to see the immigration figures without Europe getting in the way.

Of course this doesn't change the argument, but does make it a little less party political. 2004 (when the Eastern European countries joined mostly) seems to my hazy memory to be about when the anti-immigration stuff started in earnest. Certainly my first experience of it in real life was ""fucking Kosovans"" (I don't think they were actually Kosovan, but that's what was said) then ""fucking Polish"" then ""fucking Romanians"". 

I think this point is missed by a lot of people in politics and why Europe is such a big issue now. Yet I don't see any politician linking the two, instead talking about immigration and Europe as two separate issues.

Debatable. The crux of most people's complaints here is that he's gone to a fellow title contender - one even said that Arsenal are our fiercest rival and OP that Cech's one of the top five keepers in the world - and we know that he's on a 'long term deal', which implies he still has some time at the level he's been playing. 

Personally, whilst I wish Cech the very best in his move, I think this whole goalkeeping situation has been a fiasco.

I'm not sure that the situation with Carlo is comparable, though it's hard for me to be objective about it because I adored Cudicini.

But your quote doesn't show that.  Is me saying that muslims need to do some soul searching 'crass' and 'collectively blaming' them?  Really?  

I *still* think that muslims have a duty to reform their religion and I will stand by that opinion.  That's not at all equivalent to saying that every muslim is to blame whenever a terrorist attack happens, but maybe you don't see the difference.

As I said, they do have some items that are constantly stocked... although if you look carefully you'll find the suppliers tend to change, because again they are buying stock that is discountable. On the whole though the quality of their meat products is pretty good. They do occasionally bundle lower quality stuff in there but for the most part its discounted quality food. 

The distinction in meat quality is between basics/taste the difference, or sainsburys vs iceland.

When Mourinho leaves the club again, I'm sure this will be one of the sticking points that makes him decide to.  I'm sure that there is no way in hell that he would ever have given the ok for this to happen and I wonder what kind of strain this has put on Mourinho and Abromovich's relationship.

When all is said and done, this will definitely give Arsenal more points than they would have gotten without Petr.  And not to mention the champions league, this will help them immensely.

the capacity is the main factor in the birmingham to london stage but the speed helps as there are only a few trains that are 1h 20m most are 2h 20m the speed really comes in when you expand north cutting good chunks of time off travel.

rail is a good economical and environmental way to travel we should be able to use it to travel across what is a small country easily sadly it's actually easier and faster to fly from across many parts.

china is developing high speed rail at a rapid pace and it is driving the economy, we need to be able to keep up and for that we doo need a modern infrastructure",null,0,null,1435599194,null,0,false,0,csmkvta,null,t3_3bf6d3,null,t1_csmkvta,null,t1_csm62ap,null,null,null,1437441849,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Also, we have plenty of other things to be more worried about - the demographic timebomb, the end of public services, the housing crisis, the corporatisation of society, the escalating of extremism, the big brother apparatus, imminent energy scarcity, technological unemployment, climate change...",null,0,null,1435599561,null,0,false,0,csml4hu,null,t3_3bit3m,null,t1_csml4hu,null,t3_3bit3m,null,null,null,1437442039,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

This proposal is aimed at managing the demand from those who take up a large majority of air travel without excessively inhibiting the opportunity to travel abroad for those who fly less frequently.

The point at which air travel becomes a more attractive option than rail travel varies according to the route. Usually air travel tends to be competitive against trips taking longer than 4.5 hours by train. The faster the train, the further you can travel. On the high speed lines of continental europe trips up to 900km are considered to be competitive against air travel.

There are other factors that can make rail travel more attractive, depending on preference. The relative comfort of the journey, not having to go through security checks, not having to make expensive and lengthy connections between the airport and the city centre, being able to take a bike with you, etc. So it's not all about price.

Under these proposals, for the minority who fly more frequently, there would be a clear added incentive to switch to rail for trips where it is available as an alternative.

If you are talking about this season then I don't understand why you keep calling him a right winger considering Atletico havn't even played with wingers for the majority of their games considering they've usually played with 2 strikers after getting Mandzukic and Griezmann which would make Arda Turan and Koke wide midfielders. I don't expect you're calling Koke a winger either, are you?


I am well aware that Cuadrado is a right winger, that was kind of the reason I didn't even mention him once in my post. I am also aware that Willian has played most games on the right wing which is why I agree with you that **on paper** we have 3 right wingers but I just don't see it so black and white like you do. Willian has proved on multiple occassions that he is just as good through the middle as he is on the right, and that he is also able to play on the left (not only in a Chelsea shirt but also in a Shakhtar shirt and a Brazilian shirt). My point is that except for Cuadrado our attacking midfield is very versatile and can all play on the left, the right and through the middle. The fact that Willian has so many games on the right and not anywhere else is because the right side was our weakest position for a long time and simply because Hazard never missed a game.",null,0,null,1435600079,null,0,false,0,csmlgih,null,t3_3be5xw,null,t1_csmlgih,null,t1_csmdk0e,null,null,null,1437442257,null,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0,null

Another reason is due to colonialism, Before the rise of the west a lot of the islamic world was thriving and today a lot of islamic people are proud of this then colonisation happened and a lot of islamic countries came out backwords and in the case of France in Algeria  there were genocides. Another example is Israel was created by force by the british empire who led jewish immigration to palestine after WW1 against the people living there while they were colonised.

* Have a selection of German books/audio books/DVDs available. Some pupils can learn a foreign language via grammar and vocabulary, but some learn it better by just taking in foreign media.
* Help them getting a good pronounciation - especially the hard and soft German ""ch"" (Bach, ich) consonants are a real hurdle for English natives (just like the ""th"" is for us).
* Prepare them for odd abuses of the English language by the German. E.g. the ""German"" word for ""mobile phone"" is ""Handy"".
* If possible, make them come to Germany as exchange students. But if they do, tell them to use English only in an emergency situation and have them ask the Germans they are communicating with to use German, too. It is usually way easier for us to speak English with an English native than to try and decipher their German, so a constant reminder is necessary.
* Try to find out of the schools district or town is twinned with a German town, and try to contact/get on the partnership commitee. Try to contact schools in a twinned German town, and see it it possible to set up activities with them, e.g. a private (but supervised) chat session between German and English pupils. Change the channel language on a regular base.

Our partnership commitee has the problem that in our twinned English district (Northeast Lincolnshire) German is no longer mandatory in school, and its use has dropped like a lead ball, so there is no real exchange anymore.

Nine is much more damaged by the war than Ten, and that meeting would be as easy, I'd expect.  

Following that, I can't see Nine flirting with Reinette in anything like the same way, and I think that *Doomsday* would be unlikely to have *that* scene playing out the same either, both because the Doctor would have a different relationship with Rose, and because he would be focussing his emotions on the Daleks far more.  As a result, I'd imagine that neither would have quite the same emotional impact.

I would have loved to see Donna with Nine for *The Runaway Bride*, even if she didn't come into her own until later, and I could see him getting on well with Martha (hopefully with fewer tears) too.  

When it comes to *Human Nature/Family of Blood*, I think that we would see a very different John Smith - in fact, one that I would expect to have enjoyed, if anything more that Tennant's version. The setting, on the eve of the war, would have all the more poignancy.  

The dismantling of the Paradox Machine or an attempt to save the Master - probably the latter would offer a good opportunity to trigger the Doctor's regeneration, of course, in *Last of the Time Lords*.

I would then suggest that *Partners in Crime* would be a better introduction for Ten, keeping the reintorduction of Donna, with *Voyage of the Damned* placed after that, and featuring Donna as the companion.",null,0,null,1435602807,null,0,false,0,csmn8qo,null,t3_3bj66u,null,t1_csmn8qo,null,t3_3bj66u,null,null,null,1437443278,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

Health care policies stretch far across their manifesto. It is very thorough.

I personally support UKIP. I accept that a minority are bigots though I would argue the same for each party. Be careful about such generalisations. There is a lot more in voting UKIP than some would have you believe.

Thanks for your opinion.

null,false,Stealthypenguin,logo,,null,"**So Manchester City are very close to signing Enes Unal from Bursaspor, is this the sort of player that fans should be excited about?**

*Enes Ünal is quite simply the most exciting home-grown Turkish striker since the Bull of the Bosphorus – Hakan Şükür. It is still early days and he is not the finished article just but he is undoubtedly a very talented young player.*

**The consensus is that he has been very prolific at youth level, what is his goal record like?**

*His youth level record is staggering. 182 goals in 110 appearances for Bursaspor’s reserves and 24 goals in 25 international games for Turkey at under-16 level. Ünal already has his first senior international cap and became the youngest ever player to score in the Süper Lig aged 16.*

**He’s not likely to come straight into the side and could possibly start off in the Elite Development Squad at City. How close is he to breaking into a first team squad like City’s**

*Ünal is a diamond in the rough and will need some polishing before breaking into the City side. He will probably be loaned out but should Ünal stay, he could make the League Cup squad or the FA Cup team at the early stages.*

**With the new outstanding facilities at the City Football Academy, is this the right place for Unal’s development?**

 *Definitely. Turkey has the highest young population in Europe but one of the worst youth setups. In the right hands Ünal really could become a special player and City offer a level of coaching he simply would not have access to had he remained. Saying that, Bursaspor are rapidly gaining a reputation for player development. 19-year-old striker Batuhan Altıntaş was recently sold to HSV and 20-year-old Ozan Tufan has been linked with just about every major club in Europe.* 

**Were there any other clubs in for him? Should this signing be seen as a coup for Manchester City?**

*I spoke with his agent who confirmed there was strong interest from Germany, Spain, Italy as well as England. Chelsea were close to signing him before he signed a professional contract with Bursaspor. Borussia Monchengladbach and Roma were also keeping close tabs on the youngster.* 

**Finally, what can you tell us about Unal’s style of play?**

*Ünal is a powerful striker for his age who is lethal in front of goal. He has impressive composure for such a young player and good technique/first touch. He will need to work on his heading ability and overall fitness/strength to compete against Premier League sides.* ",null,0,null,1435603404,null,0,false,0,csmnmov,null,t3_3bj1yy,null,t1_csmnmov,null,t3_3bj1yy,null,null,null,1437443460,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"My own courage and determination, plus the input of one or two very rare instances of someone who gives enough of a damn to actually help.

I was looking for work for an incredibly long time (7 years or thereabouts). In 2009 I was diagnosed with several mental health conditions, some of which added a little context to my earlier experiences of retail work being totally not good for me. Of course, the jobcentre would rather stuff me into retail work than actually find something appropriate for me.

Here's where it changed:

Firstly, I managed to get a DEA at the jobcentre. DEAs are disability-specific jobcentre staff, so they're there to help people with specific difficulties. Mine had the patience to give me some time to retrain for something more suited to my sensitivities. This was a major factor in my success.

Through my own work, I tracked down some SIA training courses that are free for the jobseeker (because the jobcentre pays), although are not advertised in jobcentres or get any active referrals from staff... you need to find them yourself and get training so that the jobcentre get forced to pay later.

I took the courses, and now have 2 SIA badges. The second one, I paid for myself. The reason I managed to do this was because I saved up my DLA. Couldn't have managed that on JSA alone. It's just as well I did, because nearly 9 months after that course ended, I am in touch with some of my classmates, and they've yet to get the funding through for theirs..... relying on the government machine to help is futile.

The other major factor was through my disability-specific advisor on the Work Choice scheme. She works for Leonard Cheshire Disability. Her input was valuable to me because over the past months since finishing my course and getting my SIA licenses, she's the one who has sat me down in one-to-one sessions and jobsearched with me, long after I had lost all hope and caring about doing it myself (since the security industry is very tough to get into, and I'd amassed a huge pile of rejection letters due to inexperience).

I've been lucky. If I'd been left to it, I'd have no SIA licenses, no job, and a whole load of frustration and anger. There was never a point when I 'didn't want a job', but there's been a lot of time when I no longer wanted to look for work, because of the odds stacked against me. Struggling with mental health as well only adds to that.

My job involves far less stress and far more sitting around than I've had throughout my 'lazy, workshy and feckless' days. I spend 12 hours a night as the lone security guard in charge of 158+ youngsters facing many of the same issues I was facing no more than a month ago.",null,0,null,1435603764,null,0,1435605861,0,csmnv7n,null,t3_3bjcu2,null,t1_csmnv7n,null,t1_csmn0nz,null,null,null,1437443490,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

As FFP is counting the last 3 years, which in our case is pretty good. Where we spent 40-50 million pound net the year before, so with increased money earned I am expecting us to be allowed to have around 50 million net. 

We have so far spent 22 million Firmino, 3.5m (Gomez), 6-8 (Ings), 12.5m Clyne, Milner and Bogdan free. Puts our spending at around 40-50 million net spend. 

We are going to sell: Borini 8-10 million, Lambert 4 mill or in trade, Balotelli 8m (hopefully), Alberto 5m, Coates 2m and big question of what happens to Enrique and Manquillo. This would put us anything between 20-30 million. 
All in all FFP will allow us to have a net spend of around 50 million. We can however spend more this window, if we in the next 2 years do no spend as much money. The FFP does only care about the last 3 years and in the next 2 years we should be fine with spending. Mostly because of the huge amount of money we got from Suarez. So the club can spend more money without being penalised. But need to balance the books in the next 2 years (more sales and less in buying players). 

TL:DR there should not be a problem buying a striker and keeping Sterling. Preferably the club would sell Sterling for the 50m and use it to balance the books.

I'm not exactly using a slur here, [it is an established political grouping in the party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Labour)

&gt; Blue Labour advocates the belief that working class voters will be won back to Labour through socially conservative ideas on certain social and international issues, such as immigration, crime and the European Union,[4] a rejection of neoliberal economics[5] in favour of ideas from guild socialism and continental corporatism,[6] and a switch to local and democratic community management and provision of services,[7] rather than relying on a traditional welfare state that is seen as excessively bureaucratic.[8]

The key is in the first statement: ""advocates the belief that working class voters will be won back to Labour through socially conservative ideas"" - i.e. ""let's not actually hold these ideas because we believe in them, let's just do it because it's more likely to win us votes"".

Whilst Ed was more left-wing than Blair and Kendall, most of the things he supported that got him elected as leader got watered down due to the amount of pressure he got from the right of the party. This led to an election campaign that was perpetually confused - being tough on immigration whilst maybe possibly being okay with it, the talk of bringing rail back into public hands that got him some support completely disappeared, replaced with this half-arsed utility bill freeze.

The reality is that Ed being too left/right wing wasn't the issue in the general election. The issue was that Labour didn't really stand for anything, like it was very much like ""well we oppose the Tory cuts, but we're going to cut things, though do it nicer"". Even though I voted Labour, I didn't really feel strongly about it. If someone were to ask me what Labour's main message was in the last election, I honestly couldn't tell you.

Whilst pragmatism is necessary to rule a country, a party needs a strong principled message if it is to get votes - it needs to be able to show why we should vote them rather than stick with the government we already have. I don't think Liz Kendall can offer that because no-one can really see how a party under her stands out against the Tories.

EDIT: Essentially the only way a Kendall Labour would get elected in 2020 is if the Tories manage to enact a repeat of the 1992-1997 government and fuck up so badly that people would rather have anybody else...",null,0,null,1435604050,null,0,1435604470,0,csmo1yt,null,t3_3bfw0g,null,t1_csmo1yt,null,t1_csmiwad,null,null,null,1437443512,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

&gt;Then in March 2004, terrorists struck again, killing 191 people in the Madrid train bombs. That weekend, there were one-minute silences at football matches across Spain; at the Sydney Opera House, where the Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias was appearing; and at the political rally when the incoming Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, was celebrating his election victory.

&gt;Bertie Ahern, the Prime Minister of Ireland, which held the EU presidency, thought more was needed to bring a sense of unity to the EU, which was bitterly divided over the war in Iraq. He called on all member-nations to observe a silence for Madrid's dead – not for one minute, or even two. It was to be Europe's first three-minute silence.

&gt;If Madrid was worth three minutes, New York had to be worth four. In 2004, the 9/11 commemoration was altered so that there were four minutes of silence, one for each of the four aeroplanes destroyed by the hijackers. Two years later, George Bush led the fifth anniversary ceremony by standing in silence at Ground Zero for four minutes.

Good on Jordan Henderson for lobbying earlier this summer to be made Liverpool captain. That is just the sort of gumption that the club sorely needs. But making him Liverpool’s figurehead would be the wrong flag to fly right now. The club needs a higher standard-bearer.

It remains to be seen whether Roberto Firmino proves a good signing but it is at least a good sign. Further shows of ambition are required, along with further evidence of an ability to appreciate genuine class. Sanctifying Henderson after vilifying Raheem Sterling would suggest a club that does not quite have its sights properly aligned.

Nothing against Henderson, apart from his lack of supernatural magic. He is a player about whom there is plenty to admire: he seems a dedicated and talented professional who has added new layers to his game every season and overcome doubters, including his own manager, to establish himself as a reliable performer at Anfield. That makes him an important team member and a worthy role model, the ideal person to, say, front a club outreach programme encouraging kids to maximise their potential. Or a Nivea ad.


But it does not make him the inspirational leader to uplift and conspire with elite champions. Hell, he couldn’t even inspire Mario Balotelli to let him take a penalty last season. Compare that to Roy Keane reefing the ball from Diego Forlán in 2002: a slightly different scenario, granted, but an instructive one, all the same, because Keane was denying Forlán an easy solution, telling him that only by doing something special could he be rewarded. That’s the standard to set.

Making Henderson captain would be a facile solution because it would be a nice reward for a likeable and useful player but that is not good enough. And ultimately it would achieve nothing of merit. The captain’s armband may be overvalued in football but it is not entirely worthless and should not be wasted. Giving it to Henderson would not inspire him to wring any more commitment or skill out of himself because he already gives his utmost. Logically it serves no purpose to make him captain. And the maths doesn’t look good either: when Henderson gives 100%, he is a seven-out-of-10 player. The symbol of Liverpool must be better than that.

It is true that Henderson had as many Premier League assists to his name as Eden Hazard last season. But Chris Brunt had more than both so let’s not build a soapbox on statistics. Besides, if Liverpool were to put Henderson up for sale, would they get bids of more than the £16m that they paid for him in 2011? Probably not, even with inflation, and certainly not from Champions League clubs. In that sense, then, maybe he is a fitting flagbearer for a club that has largely failed to follow the espoused model of buying young talents and adding value. Indeed, maybe giving him the armband would be a sleight of hand designed to impress Moneyballers, an attempt to add cosmetic value in the absence of actual gain.

There is, of course, an outstanding exception: Sterling. Now there is a bona fide gem. Phenomenally skilled, he is also physically and mentally tough beyond his years, single-minded and uncompromising like a warrior, a winner. He has a rage to thrive at the top and an intolerance of mishmash floundering and small-timers. He has dared to prove himself bigger than Liverpool, which is one of the reasons why Liverpool should have taken exceptional measures to keep him, rather than patronise and pressurise him in a way they were incapable of pulling off successfully. Philippe Coutinho is a lovely player and there are others at Anfield of high promise, but only Sterling looks a surefire bet to become a great; losing him looks a terrible prospect.

What Liverpool should have done was what Manchester United did when Wayne Rooney agitated for a move from Old Trafford in 2013 while claiming he was sceptical about the club’s ambition. They should have made him a contract offer that he could not refuse (before relations deteriorated to the point that he would not, apparently, sign for even £900,000-per-week). And why not make him captain too? Alone that would not change Sterling’s stance, of course – he seems far too savvy to duped by such a sop – but by giving Sterling the armband along with a contract making him, if necessary, the highest-paid player at the club, Liverpool would have been seen to rise to Sterling’s ballsy challenge and respond with one of their own: you want to play at the Champions League? Then lead the way, comrade.

That is what the armband can be used for: to point not to past achievements, which is why James Milner would be no good, nor to present dedication, which is why Henderson is out, but rather to where the club believes it is going. Henderson is not going to guide them to the glory any more than Scott Parker blazed a trail to the top for Chelsea. Sterling might.

But probably not on his own, even if he is now older than he was last term, when the club foisted positional switches and a level of responsibility on him that they were unwilling to back up with commensurate wages. So more money, the armband, another recruit or two along the lines of Firmino, for Sterling to learn from and conjure with the way he used to when Luis Suárez was around, and some stalwarts to secure things at the back while the revellers up front do their thing. Is that too much to ask? If it is, then Sterling is better off away from Liverpool.

But the summer is young and it is still not obvious where Liverpool are headed with their rebuilding, much more of which is still needed. Could it be that the shedding of Brendan Rodgers’ backroom staff reflects not a manager that is weak, threatened or treacherous, but one that is maturing, newly clear-minded and sure how to march on to a new level?

It will be interesting to see how Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh are followed. Interesting, too, to see whether Firmino is intended to complement Sterling or replace him. And to what extent Liverpool solidify their rearguard. Nathaniel Clyne will be a strong addition, but more heads definitely need to be hunted, and with the same decisiveness that Chelsea and even Manchester United recruited last term or, indeed, that the Liverpool of yore did.

A solid goalkeeper with the ability and authority to give a sense of security to a defence that seemed permanently on the edge of breakdown last season is essential. Such a figure would be a suitable candidate for the armband. At the moment, it looks like Liverpool are either going to try to muddle on through next season – in which case they might as well name Henderson as captain – or put their faith in creative forces atoning for defensive collapses. In which case, if Sterling is squandered and leaves, then Coutinho would probably be their best standard-bearer.

So giving the Brazilian the armband and chucking a few million quid in a wishing well would fairly sum up what Liverpool are about these days.",null,0,null,1435605017,null,0,false,0,csmooj7,null,t3_3bhzeq,null,t1_csmooj7,null,t3_3bhzeq,null,null,null,1437531891,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Pew don't provide an industry standard sociodemographic breakdown of their data. Ive downloaded the source data it isn't there. This is really odd considering its an industry standard. 

Pew's polls paint muslims as a homogenous block. it is not possible to determine the ration of men to women, the islamic branch, legal school or sect of the respondents - which is critically important to their behaviours and actions, their social status, their educational status, their employment status, their voting intentions we cant determine any of that because Pew paints all muslims as the same and doesnt collect even basic data about its respondents.  

About that failure to recognise the branches, sects and legal schools, this wiki page isnt complete but goes some way towards detailing the diversity of islam in the modern world

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_schools_and_branches

There are some fairly major doctrinal differences between those branches, but apparently according to pew, they are all exactly the same, which is odd because they do recognise the differences between christian denominations 

http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/

Rather odd that they recognise the religious divisions in one faith but not other faiths. 

49% of egyptians voted for a secular candidate in the presidential election in 2011 which is exactly the opposite of sharia. 

a full implementation of sharia was on offer via the al-nour party, they polled 24% in the parliamentary elections. 

nothing like the 81% pew quoted in their frankly shady and seriously opaque research

I will happily call out Pew for being US propaganda because their research is about the worst out there. 

If you want to compare and contrast with quality attitudes research and to show you the kind of analysis you can do with sociographic breakdowns then check out the Israel Democracy Index. 

http://en.idi.org.il/media/2720081/Democracy%20Index%20English%202013.pdf

Ed being weak and left wing *was* a major issue on the doorstep. Nobody really knew what he believe in what he didn't stand for anything.  I agree with you that we had a complete failure of communication as the party had no vision or policies that could be articulated on a doorstep visit.

As to leaving your account details in your friends device, yes if you kept magically swapping from UK to US frequently it could raise alarms perhaps. Best to choose a location and stick to it. On my vpn I always use Washington, D.C. So I have no issues. 

From reading various articles it appears Netflix is turning a blind eye to it mostly, as clamping down would alienate a good chunk of their customers esp in the UK and Europe who tend to watch the U.S. More due to more choice. Of course it is against the terms of service but ye. 

I rarely watch Netflix tbh but my better half does and wants all the U.S. Shows, hence why the vpn and knowledge of how much more the U.S. Gets vs the UK content choice as I had the  job of sorting it out for her.

Just to be clear, I'm not complaining about the prospect of being tax-robbed. It's just a higher rate than my circumstances dictate, and is only temporary. But I'd gladly pay a higher rate permanently, if it meant there'd be changes made that gave everyone the understanding and support that I seem to have only managed to get thanks to my disabilities, and meant that the jobcentre became a place for supporting people into work rather than trying to chuck people off the books and beating them up to the point where life becomes intolerable.

I'd gladly pay the higher rate now, and my fair share afterwards, too.

I think the Liverpool fans are a bit cautious (probably rightly) because of the disasterous striker situation during the past season. There's a feeling that the club needs a striker similar to Sturridge and Suarez but while that may be true it doesn't exclude the possibility of other types of strikers performing well in Liverpool. I think it's a bit unfair on Benteke as he's much different than our current ""bigger"" strikers - Balotelli and Lambert. 

He's faster, more aggressive, stronger more powerful than Lambert; and while Balotelli has probably similar skillset he doesn't seem to have striker's instincs. The warning signs were there before he came to Liverpool, but I think most Liverpool fans agree that he was a risk that the club had to take at that point. He just didn't work out for many reasons, but I can't find many similar warning signs with Benteke - he looks like a striker that's on the up rather than struggling. He'd be already a huge upgrade on any of the current choices in the club. I think he'd perform in any team he ends up with.

 I never saw anything about United and others until I looked at your comment once more, and it shows that you edited it. Why would I bring this up if this wasn't the case?

&gt; This is the main difference between Cech and Begovic. He is not going to stand a chance at winning trophies with the clubs in for him 

Your main point was that winning trophies, regardless of the part that you play, is ambitious. I am saying that isn't the case, because as Cech as shown, ambition is about wanting to actually play. If this wasn't the case he would have stayed at Chelsea where he undoubtedly would have seen much more trophies then he will at Arsenal.

In fact, not just shit, but actually actively out to do harm, whether it's indoctrinating our poor children in [ideology that's the opposite of my views] or discriminating against [group I'm a member of]. 

An ""overwhelming"" number of female teachers are contemptuous of half their students? Really? What is this based on exactly, besides of course your own school experience that I'm sure has in no way left you with an axe to grind?  

The left in this country moans about test-obsessed teachers turning kids into mindless drones who lack a rounded education. The right moans about hippy ideologues corrupting children with their wacky world views instead of teaching them cold hard facts. And everyone moans about their own values not being emphasised at all times - because of course, it's the teachers' job to instill your values in your children. 

Anyway, here in the real world, there's a huge modern emphasis on boys' performance - poorer white boys in particular - and every teacher is aware of this. I get that when you were in school you may have seen the teacher as the undisputed monarch of the classroom, doing whatever they wanted, but as someone closely involved in the business of education (and it is a business) I assure you, that's not the case. In any well-run school (and remember, some 70% or so are rated good or outstanding) a teacher isn't just going to have to treat underachieving boys like the rest of the class - she is, in effect, going to have to treat them better, giving them more thought, time and attention. Otherwise she's going to be hammered by the people above her.

my point is for Begovic's situation where he either becomes Stoke's most apped goalkeeper (dont know who I replied that to) or goes to a mid table team moving to Chelsea is the more ambitious choice. Even if he wont be the starter moving to a club that will you have a realistic chance at winning big trophies with is more ambitious than going to a mid table team where your time will amount to nothing. Aside from the difference Ive mentioned twice now between him and Cech, Cech left because he has won everything he could anyway he has every possible title to his name as well as not getting game time.

The [Lipid Recovery] (http://www.sanctuary.com/en-gb/lipid-recovery-facial-oil/) is based on sunflower seed and jojoba oils, which have barrier repair and anti inflammatory properties respectively. Similar ingredients wise to [Boots Time Delay Wrinkle Reduce Oil] (http://www.boots.com/en/Time-Delay-Wrinkle-Reduce-night-oil-30ml_1605490/) - this is regularly half price at £7. Smells lovely and is packaged in a glass bottle similar to the Sanctuary use. It is based on sunflower seed and meadowfoam seed oils which has a [similar composition to jojoba] (http://www.elementis-specialties.com/esweb/webprodliterature.nsf/allbydocid/81C33FD0B999EA5585257AAA00544468/$FILE/meadowfoam%20comparison7-13.pdf).

The [Therapists Secret] (http://www.sanctuary.com/en-gb/therapist-s-secret-facial-oil/) is based on sunflower seed and rosehip seed oils (both rich in linoleic acid). I don't know of a dupe for that: there is the Boots mentioned above, or the lighter textured [NSPA Deep Hydrating Oil] (http://www.nspa.co.uk/products/deep-hydrating-facial-oil-step-3/) which is based on sunflower seed and fractionated coconut oil. The line is exclusive to Asda and regularly on two for £8, again they all smell lovely, but the oil in a plastic bottle so you might want to decant.

At the back, probably the weakest spot is injuries on full backs. We have 3. Even if one of them can play in both positions, having 4 would be very comforting since I assume the goal is to play as many games as possible in a season (aka win everything). And yes, I'm discounting Christensen, because I'm fairly sure he's getting loaned out. Especially if you follow the logic of Mourinho that the next step from first team intern is loanee.

If anything, though, I'd love to see an additional DM or CAM (or one that can play both, like a ballack type, if there's one out there). With the players we have (plus the new DM/AM), we can always revert to a 2006-ish formation, with a Maticelele behind and two in front of him.

You would probably be best with vitamin C and/ or a retinoid (vitamin A). check out the ingredients Wiki and the relevant mega reviews in the sidebar. Your family doctor can prescribe stronger retinoids.

Vitamin C is weakly hydrating but that is more of a side benefit, not something I would rely on. Niacinamide would be another option alongside the vitamin C or retinoid - still has collagen repairing properties, boosts ceramide production so supports hydration, reduces sebum output.

If those actives are ineffective and your marks are lasting much longer than a few months your best bet may be Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). This can be pricey unless you have a beauty therapy college in your area that offers it. Retinoids, vitamin C and niacinamide all aid the skin in recovering after such treatments.

The findings in this poll did not actually reflect reality when it came to the crunch, so it can't really claim to be a representative poll, more like a poll of a thousand people on a particular day without  any detailed breakdown of what kinds of muslims those respondents were.

Pew have done anything but they have painted all muslims as the same. Of course every one is an indivdual. Unique, just like every other member of every other group.

This is an important question which will determine which way to take this whole thing.

**Step 1:** Tell you boss/the landowner what happened and ask them if they could contact the parking company to have the tickets cancelled.

If they will, and they do - happy days. Job done.

**Step 2** (if they won't cancel, or the landowner won't contact them).
Take photos of all the signs in the car park, including any on entry of the car park. Make a note of what they say also.

**Step 3**, wait for the NTK or 'Notice to Keeper' that the company are required to send out. They will have to contact the DVLA to get this information, at a small cost to them. When this arrives, send an appeal (letter with proof of postage)- saying that the driver of the vehicle states that a valid parking permit was owned and on display at the time of parking, not making any admission about anything.

**Step 4** Wait for them to write back and reject your appeal (which they generally always do of course), and then you should get a POPLA code from them. If they haven't sent you one, write back and ask for a valid POPLA code, as they are required to give you by the BPA.

**Step 5** make a formal appeal to POPLA, but first educate yourself with help from the pepipoo community. They will help you sort this out properly. Without knowing which company are doing the parking enforcement here, or anything about the site - I can't help any further. Get on the pepipoo forums and ask this question, and they will help you take the right approach.

The easiest thing to do is Step 1 though and should be your first port of call.
