They also serve the useful function of sometimes getting captured or put in danger so the Doctor has someone to save other than an entire planet. I don't care about their character development at all. Not their Moms and Dads, weddings, med school, motivation issues, child hood issues/weddings again, or boyfriends. Sure some of the character developments are interesting but I would rather see that development applied to the Doctor and when you put the companion at the center of the show I just lose interest. 

                    You're honestly telling me that the Doctor can lose a companion to another dimension or never be able to speak to them again or their brain will fry and he is more or less fine with it but one gets sent back in time by a weeping angel and he could totally still go back and hang out with them and still go on adventures and whatnot just has to bring them home  to a different time than before and he is so sad he goes to Victorian London to mope around in the clouds?

It would be much more convincing if the author presented compelling reasons why the other leadership candidates would be better placed to win, but they do not. The reason is simple: people may desperately need a Labour victory in 2020 as claimed in this article, but they won't get them.

Electoral bias means that the chances of Labour winning the next election are overwhelmingly poor. They would need to have a radical, incomparable turnaround to even get close.

null,null,FezojT,null,null,null,"I think most people take the view that public infrastructure is a good thing to fund from general taxation because most of our economy relies on it. Imagine how cripplingly underdeveloped parts of the country would be if we decided that the motorway network is only important for the end user and that we should start charging for them on a per-mile basis. Literally everything in your house, from the bricks and mortar in the walls to the milk in your fridge, likely got where it was because of the motorway network; it's something fairly essential if you want to have the kind of economy we have with the kind of prices we're used to. It is an example of something that is universally beneficial, it makes sense that it is operated as a natural monopoly so it also makes sense that we fund the motorway network using general taxation.

The same applies to the Tube network. You're thinking of the cleaner as a consumer of a service and arguing that their wages should be higher to compensate for their use of the Tube. Really the cleaner is an economic commodity used to provide a service to other consumers. It's abstracted a bit because people and the services they provide aren't as economically tangible as loaves of bread, but an unhealthy proportion of our country's economy relies on the ability of workers to move around London quickly and affordably. Of course a lot of that money is coming from people working in finance who can certainly afford higher ticket prices, but they in turn rely on the skills of cleaners and other low-paid workers to operate their businesses. 

It is in our interests to keep public transport affordable, the Tube makes sense as a natural monopoly and we do all benefit from it indirectly, so I don't really think the comparison of public transport subsidy to corporate welfare is valid. If anything forcing people with less money to pay higher ticket prices instead of taking more money from businesses through taxation arguably amounts to indirect corporate subsidy.",null,0,null,1440785354,null,null,false,0,cuivnpm,null,t3_3ipo1e,null,null,null,t1_cuikt6i,null,null,null,1441552989,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The scouting department and black box know infinite the amount of football that I or anyone else here do, but anyone can see that Son's ability to press and be even more versatile than Saido (a big reason why we wanted him) makes him a better fit for us.

Some people are highly skeptical because of a lackluster goal record in a pretty weak Uruguayan division, but there's no reason he can't develop and advance. Don't write him off immediately, but don't expect the world, either.

You can find his transfer market profile [here](http://www.transfermarkt.com/leandro-rodriguez/profil/spieler/238988), but I'll give a quick overview for those who want it:

He's 22, approximately 5'9"", and has 20 goals and 6 assists in 80 senior appearances. It should be noted that 20 of these appearances were substitute appearances, and on average, he plays about 60 out of ever ninety, and his return comes to a goal or assist about every two full games he plays. Those are career numbers. He improved significantly on those, delivering ten goals and 4 assists last season, particularly in the second half of the season where he scored 6 and assisted 2 in ten games, and those number probably would have been higher, but he was out with an injury. So, overall, I'd say he's a player with upside, has some potential, but difficult to say beyond that.",null,0,null,1440786139,null,null,false,0,cuiw71t,null,t3_3ir1to,null,null,null,t1_cuiuykf,null,null,null,1441553243,null,10,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,10,null

To add to what /u/emre23 said, Mazinho played in Italy for Lecce &amp; Fiorentina from 1990-1992, which was when Thiago was born. He went back to Brazil and played for Palmeiras from 1992-1994, which was when Rafinha was born. Mazinho later played in Spain for Valencia/Celto Vigo/Elche from 1994 through 2001, which is where the boys grew up. His father finished his career off in Brazil, and everyone lived in Rio until 2005, Thiago being part of Flamengo's youth academy for numerous years, and Rafinha being a part of it for two years. They moved back to Spain bc his father decided to open up a soccer school there, therefore both players ended up in Barcelona. So the two brother basically lived in Spain most of their lives. [article in portuguese for the above info](http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/selecao-brasileira/noticia/2013/01/pelas-maos-de-j-cesar-e-pet-paixao-de-rafinha-pelo-fla-comecou-no-maraca.html)

Brazilians, me being one of them, were hoping both Thiago and Rafinha would play for us. His father is a club idol for Vasco and won the World Cup in 94 (having started in every game), Copa America in 89, and an Olympic silver medal in 88. He is very well respected in Brazil as a footballer. With Thiago and Rafinha looking promising, everyone was hoping both would come over, but no one faulted Thiago for not doing so as he was raised in Spain for most of his life. We were happy to see Rafinha choose to wear the yellow top and respected Thiago's choice. 

It is much different than a few others who chose to represent another country. For instance, Diego Costa chose Spain as well, but he did not have any affiliation to Spain until he was 19 years old. Not only that, but Costa actually played for Brazil twice only a few short months before he changed his alligiance (March games, October decision). Brazil, since we were already qualified to the WC as hosts, did not have any 'official' games, therefore Costa only played in friendlies which does not tie him down. When the list for the Confederations Cup came out (our only official games before the WC), Diego was not on the list. Del Bosque was very smart and jumped at the opportunity. He guaranteed Costa a starting place on the team, and that pretty much made him submit a request for FIFA. Brazilians were pissed bc he didn't choose Spain out of love for Spain, he chose it bc he was guaranteed in the starting XI. Also Brazilians were pissed bc Brazil needs a center forward really really badly. Had he been at the World Cup, we would have been a different team. Not saying the results would have changed, but our style of play definitely would have. Lastly, we don't really blame Scolari for not choosing Costa for the Confederations Cup. Fred was on fire at the time as was Jo. And although Costa had scored 20 goals that season (10 in the league), he was causing too much trouble on the pitch to justify calling him up. It wasn't until the following season where he scored 36 goals or something like that. In hindsight Scolari should have chosen him, but at the time no Brazilian was flipping out bc we left him out. 

Personally, I did not really get too beat up about Costa even though I would have liked to have him on our side, but Brazil will eventually find a servicable forward and we'll be okay. 

A few other examples of this would be -

Pepe and Deco, both who also didn't move to Portugal until 18 &amp; 20 respectively. The difference is that at the time they chose to represent Portugal, neither really would have been selected for Brazil so we understood their decision. Of course both would have been great to have in the long run, but when they received their first cap for Portugal it would have been tough to justify their selection for Brazil. Deco actually scored against Brazil on his debut which was on my birthday :( 

Eduardo (Arsenal's Eduardo) for Croatia too. He moved when he was 16, but his portuguese is so awful that if he had chosen Brazil no one would believe he was Brazilian haha. And again, we had strikers at that time, so the public understaood why. 

Anyway, there are so many examples for Brazil. Thiago Motta, Marcos Senna,  Marcos Gonzalez, Cacau, Liedson, Kuranyi etc... Most of them make perfect sense and no one really cared. Diego's just struck a cord bc he had played for us just months before making his decision, and chose Spain for the wrong reasons.",null,0,null,1440786604,null,null,1440786866,0,cuiwidj,null,t3_3iqux5,null,null,null,t1_cuit6nw,null,null,null,1441553391,null,22,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22,null

null,null,digi_talman,null,null,null,"After watching the game yesterday, it seems at least 1 quality creative midfielder is required. I know Clasie has that element to his play, but I'm talking about a more attacking orientated player. Southampton should go after 22-year old [Hakim Ziyech](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/hakim-ziyech/profil/spieler/217111) (FC Twente). He basically was the replacement for Tadic there, but I rate him much higher, especially for the Premier League. Is more energetic, motivated and brings more for the team against better/stronger opposition, but most importantly he is far more consistent. Ziyech is currently captain of the Twente squad.

Season 13/14 at SC Heerenveen he scored 11 goals and had 13 assists. [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXY6a2D5K4s)

Season 14/15 he transferred to FC Twente (2.5 million fee) and he scored 13 goals and had 15 assists. [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstvVv0PYVM)

Season 15/16 at Twente during 3 apps so far he has scored 2 goals and had 1 assist. [Video of his goal against ADO Den Haag.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLCpiN2emNQ)

Current age: 22. Left-footed. Market Value: around 5 million pounds. About to break into the Dutch squad. (At Southampton might make it to EC16). Last 2 season he has been injured for a total of 12 days, missing 2 matches for Heerenveen.

Great set-piece taker, fantastic technique, passing ability and vision, good speed and determination, decent dribbling skills. He is a real nr. 10, but capable of central midfield and can also play on the right. He scores, but creates more. Weaknesses: aerial ability and strength (EPL standards). Most impressive is his consistency, both in terms of performance and development.

Ziyech would have been perfect for the match up in Denmark. One of those players that knows what is going on around him (intelligent, I guess) and can break open a game with a single pass.

**Twente are accepting bids, because they are in big financial trouble.** For the right money he can go. I'm honestly surprised that, given the situation of his club and the abilities of this player, the only known interest has been from Wolfsburg who wanted him as a replacement when Inter was about to get Perisic, until Inter backed out of the deal. He is still very much on Wolfsburg radar as he is again linked, but now as replacement for Kevin de Bruyne.

He should be great with the likes of Clasie, Wanyama, Romeu behind him and the likes of Mane, Pelle, Jrod, Juanmi, Long up front, linking it all together (in my mind that would be a 4-3-3 with Ziyech as the most forward midfielder, or a 4-2-3-1 with Ziyech as CAM).

Right now he is too good for the Twente team, also due to their financial misery, and I would love to see him play for the Saints. He is a quality player Southampton could really use as I find the squad lacking in this area. Mane can play nr. 10 yes, but in my view that is not his natural position, because he lacks the gift of vision like a real nr. 10 does. A real nr. 10 scores only when this is the best course of action, but to score himself this is never his main target. Mane still has to develop this. Mane for me is a winger, and Robben for example took many years before he became capable of playing in that position as a winger. With Pelle laying the ball off it would be very nice to have a nr. 10 that can finish from outside the box, or has the ability to distribute the ball to upcoming wingers with pace (like Mane, or possibly Juanmi/Long), the latter giving Pelle the change to get himself into position before the goal. Tadic can play nr. 10 too, but he would be back up... 

The big downside to this transfer would be that Ziyech is one or two steps ahead of JWP in terms of his development and would be even more competition for the kid for a midfield position. 

Ziyech shouldn't be more expensive than 6-10 million though (or even less) and should be worth twice or thrice that amount in 3 years time, which is when he would likely be sold by Southampton... 

Anyway ever since the game yesterday and also the games in the Premier League thus far, this has been on my mind as there was just a lack of penetration through the middle and only Mane looked capable of becoming dangerous there because of pace alone, so I decided to dump my thoughts here. This team needs a genuine nr. 10... Pass it along please, especially if you just so happen to run into a certain Ronald Koeman!",null,0,null,1440787107,null,null,false,0,cuiwuic,null,t3_374oc4,null,null,null,t3_374oc4,null,null,null,1441553550,null,5,null,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,5,null

null,null,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,null,"&gt; But you chose someone who doesn't play as a winger and isn't asked to.

In a positional sense he is asked to play as a winger, however his job role is different to that of someone who can play in the same position but has a different role. Like my Ibe and Firmino comparison at Arsenal. Position in the winger position, but asked to do different roles. 

I'm not saying you cannot take someones performances at RWB and translate them over to how they will play RW. I'm saying that there are better examples to use, for example a player actually playing RW compared to playing RWB. 

As for Ibe and Markovic not crossing a lot. Both of their main strikers they supply to for their respective teams are both small. Sterling was our striker for most of the season last season and it's fair to say he won't win you many headers. Along with Lima for Benfica, no crosses is a bit of a surprise to me, but crossing clearly wasn't Benficas preferable style of play. All other players you've listed had strikers that can win headers, or played a style of football that would promote it (Dzecko, RVP, Fellaini, Bony). 

If you've watched us this season so far and our matches last season, would you Can and Clyne attack in a similar fashion as Clyne is our current RB and Can played RCB last year and you claimed he pushed forward in a similar fashion? I disagree because they obviously didn't.

The NECA (North East Combined Authority) are planning on taking everything back in house and doing it TfL style with setting routes and letting private companies bit for the routes. This should get everything back on track and allow the Metro to expand.

I mean, it's all well and good that some people don't mind, but that's no reason why it should be shrugged off when it could have easily been solved for everyone else too.

Well **now** we're in agreement! It only took a few hours :)

I knew you were going to say Benfica didn't cross much. Again, with only CL stats, Benfica has the 12th longest average pass length out of the 32 CL teams. To show this stat is not a false correlation to crossing, the 5 teams with the shortest average pass length were Barca, Bayern, Dortmund, Arsenal and PSG.

With regard to Clyne and Can going forward--no, I would not say Can got forward as often as Clyne does. But that would make sense, as Clyne is operating as an actual fullback, not a right-sided CB in a back 3. I probably wasn't clear enough when I explained this, but Can operated *defensively* as a RB in the back 3 when the opponent was in our half. He didn't operate offensively that way. And that seems to be besides the point anyway, when explaining the *defensive* role of a wing back versus a winger. On either a back 4 or a back 3, the CBs are not called upon to provide width, the WB or FB is. Whether it's a back 3 or back 4, they will operate offensively in a very similar fashion, and I can't see the width being any different. A 3-5-2 such as Rodgers used was meant to provide extra defensive cover, not more or a different type of width.

If you've got a part which is in spec but then loose spots that is quite normal. The chain will develop tight and loose spots. Make sure that you're feeling the tension in the middle of the lower run of the chain. Work out where the front sprocket is. Don't go by the bit of chain which you can see. You need to figure it from the front sprocket or you won't get an accurate reading. 

If that is the tightest point then it is very loose. If you can pull the chain away from the rear sprocket enough you could put an HB pencil in the gap, you need a new chain and sprocket set. If not then you just need to tighten the chain up a bit. 

Remember a chain being slightly on the loose side is not really a bad thing. People are tempted to really get them tight, thinking it'll stop the chain jumping off the rear sprocket but that is very rare unless the chain is very, very loose. The swinging arm pivot is aft/behind of the front sprocket. What that means is that length of the run between the front and rear sprocket does not remain constant. As the rear spring/springs compress and rebound the distance of the upper and lower runs increases and crucially decreases. If a chain is too tight it will wear the output shaft bearings out and put strain on the output shaft, in extreme cases chains have broken and output shafts have very slightly bent, necessitating a strip down and rebuild with a new shaft.

&gt;Other documents taken from the NSA by Snowden and previously published by NBC News show that JTRIG, which is part of the NSA's British counterpart, the cyber spy agency known as GCHQ, used a DDOS attack to shut down Internet chat rooms used by members of the hacktivist group known as Anonymous. 

&gt;The documents also show that a one-time signals surveillance agency, GCHQ, is now conducting the kinds of active espionage operations that were once exclusively the realm of the better-known British spy agencies MI5 and MI6.

&gt;While some of the unitâs activities are focused on the claimed areas, JTRIG also appears to be intimately involved in traditional law enforcement areas and U.K.-specific activity, as previously unpublished documents demonstrate. An August 2009 JTRIG memo entitled âOperational Highlightsâ boasts of âGCHQâs first serious crime effects operationâ against a website that was identifying police informants and members of a witness protection program. Another operation investigated an Internet forum allegedly âused to facilitate and execute online fraud.â The document also describes GCHQ advice provided âto assist the UK negotiating team on climate change.â

https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/06/22/behavioural-science-support-jtrig/

&gt;It provides the most comprehensive and sweeping insight to date into the scope of this unitâs extreme methods. Entitled âBehavioral Science Support for JTRIGâs Effects and Online HUMINT [Human Intelligence] Operations,â it describes the types of targets on which the unit focuses, the psychological and behavioral research it commissions and exploits, and its future organizational aspirations. It is authored by a psychologist, Mandeep K. Dhami.

&gt;The report states that the controversial unit âcurrently collaborates with other agenciesâ including the Metropolitan police, Security Service (MI5), Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Border Agency, Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and National Public Order and Intelligence Unit (NPOIU). The document highlights that key JTRIG objectives include âproviding intelligence for judicial outcomesâ; monitoring âdomestic extremist groups such as the English Defence League by conducting online HUMINTâ; âdenying, deterring or dissuadingâ criminals and âhacktivistsâ; and âdeterring, disrupting or degrading online consumerism of stolen data or child porn.â",null,0,null,1440790159,null,null,false,0,cuiyw4i,null,t3_3iltn8,null,null,null,t1_cuiihkp,null,null,null,1441554579,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Moreno*------Lovren--------Skrtel-------Clyne

*Moreno coming in for Gomez is the only change I see Rodgers making, and as I saw Moreno with the proverbial orange bib along with the others perceived first-teamers, there might be something into it. Gomez offers more solidity at the back, Moreno would provide pace and width in attack and he's been doing very well recently.

That very 4-3-3 could turn into a 4-4-2 diamond like so:

WIth modern bikes of a smaller capacity, front disc rear drum is not uncommon. All the way upto say 500cc you'll see rear drums.

When you apply the brake the shoes are forced outward, against the drum of the wheel, The wheel therefore slows. They're usually cable rather than hydraulically operated on motorcycles.

Got a OnePlus One up for either trade or cash. Can pay through PayPal, Barclays PingIt or bank transfer, I don't mind.

It's in perfect condition. Comes with a OnePlus One euro charger block, however I have a UK plug for it too.

I'm wanting either a 144hz monitor as stated or around Â£195 cash.

Naturally, this is not nescesarily indicative of public opinion on the question of Northern Ireland's place in the UK.

You know if we lost a game because lopes made some mistakes Pellegrini would be crusified by people like you who want to jump on him for every little thing. 

And to clarify the Pogba situation was about him wanting more playtime and a lot more wages than Man U could offer without breaking there pay structure. He wasn't good enough for there first team at that time and he wasn't happy with that so the leave was benficial all around. Sure Man U might regret it now but thats a chance you take with selling any player. We've sold Dzeko who then scored 2 in his first game and people wanted him back after some dreadful performances which rightly got him sold.

God, we can't have two Universities that have better scores for men on average?

This article is riddled with people's opinions, and not facts;

&gt;Often, my supervisors [who are mostly male] will engage in âbanterâ with male students, but maintain their distance with me and other female students.

&gt;I wonât answer questions unless I am sure I am right for fear of being humiliated.

&gt;needs to be recognised as the first step in addressing the systematic barriers to equal opportunities of success

However:

&gt;Research conducted by the university has shown that female and male students at Cambridge are equally likely to obtain a good degree â but men have a higher chance of being awarded a First than women in some academic disciplines.

&gt;However, men also have a significantly higher chance of being awarded a Third than women in some academic disciplines.

Just full of pointless comments.

Correlation does not imply causation.

Just because women do better in 99% of universities, does not imply that Oxbridge is sexist in some form.",null,0,null,1440793065,null,null,false,0,cuj0tu7,null,t3_3irdlv,null,null,null,t3_3irdlv,null,null,null,1441555491,null,28,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28,null

When there is no specific method of judging a players potential it becomes a question of time and unlucky for rony , his time isnt now , there is just too much quality in the bench. Now is the time for establishment , we will need to keep the good work going for some more time , then take risks , maybe even rony might come back (like matic) .

http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/pay-and-reward/nhs-terms-and-conditions/specialty-and-associate-specialist-doctors

&gt;The specialty doctor grade provides an opportunity for doctors to have a rewarding career with progression to the top of the grade over a number of years whilst gaining experience and extending and developing their skills base. Fundamental to the contract is that doctors will be required to undertake job planning and appraisal whilst developing a portfolio to record their progress in the job. Commencing with a number of annual increments, doctors will progress through two thresholds by evidencing that they have participated in job planning and appraisal and have developed whilst in the role. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_registrar

&gt;A Specialty Registrar (StR) is doctor who is working as part of a specialty training programme in the UK. This is known as a training grade as these doctors are supervised to an extent, as part of a structured training experience that leads to being able to undertake independent practice in a hospital specialty or working as a general practitioner...Doctors can enter this training grade after completing their foundation training, but need to go through a competitive process of entry into specialty training schemes. [3] Completing the training scheme will lead to the award of a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT), subject to satisfactory in-training assessment and progress; this is a necessary pre-requisite for entry onto the Specialist Register or GP Register.

And here http://surgicalcareers.rcseng.ac.uk/students/school-student/entry-requirements-how-do-i-train it seems clear your time on the specialty registrar still counts as ""training.""

If there is a good source contradicting this I'd love to see it as this doesn't seem intuitive to me; and it definitely doesn't seem ""fair"" but that's the way the system looks set up to me. The table on the wiki link seems clear, you are in training for at least 8 years and that 40k is for your first year of the specialty registrar.

A domestic PV system will generate 4,000kWh's a year. Which is approximately your annual requirements. So for Â£5k you're offsetting your homes energy use for the next 40 years. It just happens that battery storage isn't quite there yet so that energy gets used by your neighbours. Still good for society as its displacing our high carbon intensity grid. 

Because of lack of storage the direct bill savings are relatively low. It's a market failure and a physics problem. 

You have to look at FITs in the form of supporting fledgling technology, like the Internet, we subsidise and invest in things all the time as a country that don't necessarily make economic sense from day 1. 

Solar has come down from Â£20k to Â£5k in 5 years. If we get system costs down to Â£1k-Â£2k, with a fair market price for the electricity exported, you'll see them on half the homes in the UK. This sounds good to everyone right? How quickly can we get to this stage...well we just took a massive step backwards. 

Solar isn't the answer on its own. I've been in the energy industry 8 years and I'd be lying if I said it was. But I've also monitored trends in cost and deployment and people have been consistently wrong with solar. It's getting cheaper far quicker than we expected. The problem is that the soft costs our end aren't coming down fast enough - grid connection, inverters, labour. But they're getting there. Or they were.

This is not actually true at all, it's a really bizarre myth United fans seem to have pedalled to make it less embarrassing he left.

He took a pay cut to go to Juventus, he didn't want money at all.

He wanted a guarantee of playtime, and SAF wouldn't do that. I would also say he was good enough, seeing as he was starting for Juventus a few months later, and United were choosing to play Rafael in midfield over him.

Otherwise I agree.

Rony wanted to play every week. He's not good enough to do it now, and he didn't want to sign a new deal, so there was no other option. What could the club do? Nasri is going to pless less often than Lopes wants to.

Manu Garcia is much better anyway.

The type of people that you are describing (pompous, rich, etc.) are by *far* a minority - most people here are on student loans and wouldn't be able to afford any of that sort of stuff, and of the few that can, most have enough sense not to be an asshole about it.

But now the Daleks can fly, can absorb human DNA through their shell, and they can transport planets through time and space to build an Armageddon machine. And the Master is some sort of time-paradox superhero bent on the destruction of the universe.

His conscience was contained within a Matrix Slice (that's what the Nethersphere was) and we know that Gallifrey has survived in a supposedly inaccessible pocket dimension. What if the Nethersphere wasn't shutting down when he sent that final message - what if it was transmitting its stored data to the main Matrix on Gallifrey (or to the closest proxy - the TARDIS data core)? Missy would have been actively preventing this while working on it, since we see several scenes where she's plugged herself in to greet new arrivals personally. But after she was thwarted, nothing would have kept the slice from going through a regular maintenance cycle and attempting to upload the 'data'. After that point, Danny's a ghost in the machine, quite literally. The question then becomes, how does he get out?

We already know Danny has at least one descendent who looks just like him, and possibly more (it's unclear whether Kai Blue is a descendent of Danny Pink, but it's heavily implied, and we don't get a good look at him before he dies but he also superficially resembles Danny). If Danny was uploaded into Gallifrey's Matrix, it might be possible it has a similar effect on the time stream as when Clara threw herself into the Doctor's timeline.

Of course, I could just be heavily overthinking this whole thing, and the whole scenario is as simple as, ""The writers screwed up.""",null,0,null,1440797568,null,null,false,0,cuj3o95,null,t3_3ipria,null,null,null,t1_cuj27ah,null,null,null,1441556832,null,5,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

Then if there are any tickets left, individual match tickets can be bought.

If it was the Champions League, it wouldn't get to the individual ticket stage. Europa League last season did get to the individual ticket stage as they only opened the lower half of the stadium cause the teams we were playing were a bit meh for lots of people to bother going, which was a shame (but understandable).

This time, we're playing some pretty exciting games, so whole stadium should be open. You'll just need to keep an eye out on the website to see how they're selling tickets.

I agree that those rubbish courses could be made a lot better if the QAA did its job better, but poorer students would still be worse off than the more privileged students going to places like Oxbridge/Russell Group (where they'll make connections etc.) and studying subjects like medicine (which lead to financial stability).

Pritch could be replaced with either of Alli or Lamela and I'd be okay. Lamela has only bee bad against Stoke, but has hardly locked a spot down.

He argues that it will be bad for English football in the long term, but all of his points and arguments only make sense in the short term, and in the end it comes across as if Jose Mourinho had written it after the last approach.   
Jose, when he was so certain that after they managed to get John to hand in the transfer request then he would have won, not got the centre-back he needed, I don't think it was about that anymore, It was about getting what he wanted.  
  
  
  
Fuck him and fuck Chelsea, I would rather both Manc clubs and even the Shite win the league than them, they built their recent success on being a bully team, signing the likes of Essien, Mikel, Drogba, Ivanovic anyone big enough to fit into the system of breaking up all their opponents play in the middle of the park.  
  
  
Even now that they have some of the best talents in the modern game(Hazard, Fabregas, Pedro) they still insist on playing shit bullying football and parking the fucking bus. The Fabregas thing sums up their scouting approach.  
Fabregas couldn't stop talking about how he still loved Arsenal when he was back at Barca, but Chelsea got in his head, probably working at it for such a long time and when it comes down to it all they were prepared to pay unreasonable money(to club AND player) and their tactics of driving up the prices of all the talent, specifically the English talent and removing all the competition outside of the top 5 would have worked, It would have destroyed the premier league and made it like La Liga Where the disparity between the top and the bottom of the league is sickening.  
  
But no, the TV money increased again, and now suddenly other clubs don't have to sell off all their talent just to stay afloat. Maybe just maybe now clubs that have a knack of producing good talents, like us and southampton will have more of a chance.",null,0,null,1440799242,null,null,false,0,cuj4nlj,null,t3_3irvts,null,null,null,t3_3irvts,null,null,null,1441557295,null,24,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,24,null

null,null,vln,null,null,null,"Just a few of the possible scenarios:

* Immigrants who arrived when the rules were less stringent, and their descendents. From the 1950s up until the 1970s, immigration from the Commonwealth was encouraged, to provide labour in low-paid jobs. Idi Amin's expulsion of Asians from Uganda saw the drawbridge rise.
* Permanent residence or citizenship acquired through time spent here in academic study, employment on a time-limited visa, etc.
* Residence acquired through marriage (the rules on this one are stricter, or more punitive depending on your point of view, than in the past)
* The ability to bring dependents or other close family to the country after gaining residence. (Again, the rules change over time, how easy it was to do this ten/twenty/thirty years ago might be very different from today)
* Citizenship of another EU country, likely to tie in with that country's comparable history of recent immigration and how their rules have changed over time. Turkish immigration to Germany, or north Africans to France, are possible examples.
* Refugees. Despite what our media suggests, and every effort of the bureaucracy, some people are found to be genuinely needing asylum.
* Illegal residence. Some of the people you interacted with might not have legitimate residency. Most commonly, this is due to overstaying, e.g. a student visa running out, but taking a cash-in-hand job proves more attractive than going home. These people are prime targets for exploitation. However, that doesn't mean they're necessarily hidden away, they (or their employers/exploiters) might just be calling the authorities' bluff.

Another factor to consider is sharia rules regarding banking and finance. Avoiding usury means not going down traditional western routes for investing money such as savings accounts. Putting cash into a bricks-and-mortar property and the associated business is an alternative. Therefore, there's likely to be a greater number of visible businesses emerge from Muslim communities than from others.

He had... pretty much no GCSEs, and it was just sheer persistence and a love of animals that got him there. He'd done lots of volunteering/casual work at local farms and the little petting zoo in a local park. I know he's said they had lots of teenage folks in to follow them around etc, but it was quite limited by safety/training and so forth. Either way I don't expect the whole 'I've got no GCSEs, but gimme a chance' thing will work these days. I imagine the more animal-based qualifications the better.

My uncle worked with rhinos and giraffes usually, and went to South Africa to do... something with white rhinos. I don't actually know what. He also got us all in free to loads of zoos in Europe. Random perk. :D  

One thing that I guess surprised me most about his work was just *how* risky it was. He got gored by a rhino (it only tore his lip! minimal damage!) and his friend who still works there recently got pretty much crushed when two rhinos decided to fight around him (he's alive, and much better now, jsyk).

This (while not being an ambiguous scene in itself) displays the possibility of the mysterious occurrences having rational and ordinary explanations.

Therefore, the cup scene is both not ambiguous, and also sets up the very thought process that the episode sets up around every other occurrence.

The argument is simple, has been consistent, and I believe that it explains how the cup scene is an example of the episode being cleverly done.

I currently be leave that the current western democratic processes are an illusion of freedom. You basically cannot get the law changed unless you are prepared to start a mass riot. This is shown many times in the UK where there are signed partitions calling on the government to change things and nothing happens except some bullshit excuse (For example https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104349). But this is only an example (probably a poor example). Of many.

Some of the rules I would bring in if in power but would be impossible to pass. If you are or have been a member of parliament. You would not be able to invest in any private companies after being in that position or have a cap on the return of any such investment. I would also request that all positions in politics are paid the maximum of the average salary of the country. This would be in an effort to make it unattractive to money grabbing greed idiots and only brings people into the position who actually want to do good for the people.

Also if the above isn't true. You will also realize that it is not possible inside the current system to actually fix certain problems which should actually be one main priority as a civilization. We currently treat out farmers like shit. Our bankers like hero's and are health care workers like slaves. We don't invest in the next generation of people instead we attempt to enslave them in debt with student loans. We have our priorities so far wrong in this society its just getting ridiculous.

Such problems are things like.

1. Over population

2. Over use of resources.

3. Climate change.

4. Layers on layers of corruption.

For almost all modern politics. Politicians will promise everything and mean it to get into power. However once their they realize that they cannot actually do anything. Then their job turns into ""please don't let it go wrong on my watch"".

As far as content is concerned i guess it was slightly stale especially in regard to KDB , but i guess that won't be a problem after the transfer window closes . 

I liked they way u guys tried to structure the podcast based on specific posts or events . 

If possible , could u guys incorporate some of the chants , songs into the podcast , I guess the international audience will love it. I would love to hear about the youth games too , i suppose we can approach u/esteemedkompany for help 

Overall , great work guys , this can become a feature of this sub that we can look forward do, will love to pitch in sometime

1) sign on, if the dole still exists. 

2) [volunteer] (https://do-it.org). Find a role that's vaguely close to what you want to do, and ask what training/job help they'll give you. Do this for a day or half day a week. There is a lot of demand for volunteers at the moment so take advantage. It'll give you references and experience. 

3) spend half day a week helping at home. 

4) do some courses, either online or at college. 

5) get a part time minimum wage job. Pull pints or wash dishes. It'll give you some cash and some structure to your day. 

6) go running three times a week and make time to see friends. Don't let unemployment turn into depression 

If you are really struggling to get work experience, try [full time volunteering] (http://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/opportunity/full-time-volunteer-opportunity-all-over-the-uk/) they'll give you accommodation and pocket money.

&gt;The male / female divide

&gt;Long gone are the days of Oxbridge as a male-only institution. In 2011, the male:female ratio of accepted students at Cambridge was 54:46. Here, female applications are heavily weighted towards the Arts, with females making 55.6% of applications, compared to an equivalent figure of 46.3% for Sciences. Languages and essay subjects such as English and History of Art boast a particularly high female presence, though interestingly both History and Classics remain largely evenly divided. Economics, Music and Philosophy are the exceptions, attracting a higher male presence of 66.9%, 64.4% and 64.6% respectively. The Science subject which attracts the most female students is Veterinary Medicine, but otherwise women remain a minority, representing less than a third in Engineering, Maths and, notoriously, Computer Science for which the percentage of female acceptances was only 2.9% in 2011.

&gt;While Oxford has a more or less similar pattern of subject choices according to gender, the disparity between men and women within the Sciences is less pronounced. The success rate by percentage is greater for female chemists and engineers, for instance, than for their male counterparts. In certain Arts subjects, however, the 2011 intake were weighted towards girls to a remarkable extent; of the sixteen offers made for combined History &amp; Modern Languages, fifteen were to girls, while all seven offer holders for Classics and English were female. It seems more encouragement is needed to equalise the gender inequality the Arts.

There is a ratio of 46:54, Women to Men at Cambridge and that will play a part in why men do better than women at Oxbridge.  

It's a numbers game.



If I actually wanted to take a simplistic view of this, I could have just stated that from a male perspective: ""we need to address the systematic barriers to equal opportunities of success in 99% of universities, because women do better than men""",null,0,null,1440804900,null,null,false,0,cuj7rj9,null,t3_3irdlv,null,null,null,t1_cuj6hep,null,null,null,1441558825,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Still can't help feeling there is something lacking in attack, like a nr. 10, but if this is really it, it'll have to do. Once the whole squad is fit and have some proper match fitness attack will improve.

And yes, always a risk to get players from outside of the EPL, but Djuricic never was an accomplished player in the Dutch League though. Not for me at least. I remember when he was 17 or 18 he started his first matches for Heerenveen and people started comparing him to Cruijff because of his looks.... Truth is his first season as a starter (10 goals, 12 assists) was better than his second (7 goals, 7 assists), and both of them weren't out of the ordinary. It was just impressive, because he was so young. He had technique sure, nice dribbling and he had flair (which gets you pretty far in the Eredivisie), but really lacking in a lot of areas. Mentality being one of them. Not a fighter, lets put it that way. To make it in leagues like EPL, you have to put up a fight at least... He left the Eredivisie thinking himself ready, before even attempting to at least improve his 'decent' second year. Besides doing well at Heerenveen doesn't really say anything with the lack of pressure there, so if you can never replicate those performances somewhere else (Alves...) thats already a sign. In the end he really never was right for the Premier League and he still hasn't had a good season since his time in Fryslan, poor Djuricic. He should go to the Serie A. He's never been there. That might be a perfect competition for him. But I'm afraid he's just one of those players who had their best season the second or third year of their career...

Ziyech started at Heerenveen. Had a good season and his club ended 5th. Then he transferred to Twente (the club that ended up being 3rd that same year) because he thought it was a good move. It wasn't... Twente entered a shitstorm, financial trouble and a dysfunctional organisation. The team had weakened and ended up 10th. Lower than Heerenveen in 7th! But still... Ziyech had a better season than he had the previous year at Heerenveen... And he has started this season as captain, while Twente is still cruising on the river of shit, impressive too. That is automatically why he is different from Djuricic. It says plenty about him, even going forward. BUT it's never a guarantee he would do brilliant at Southampton, at all. Its just more promising. 

Pretty long story, but I'm sure all of this is still appropriate in a transfer related thread. Just more about Eredivisie imports in general. Bit boring perhaps, but I find it interesting to compare players this way..

Defamation does generally have to be in a public setting and can be countered with a defence of justification (the statement can be proven to be true) or fair comment (the statement can be shown to be a view that a reasonable person may have held, even if motivated by dislike or hatred). It must also have caused ""serious harm"" to the claimant's reputation.

Even things such as constructive dismissal claims require a much, much higher threshold of damage to reputation, trust or relationship than a simple use of the term 'lazy' in a non-public setting.

I'd therefore suggest that you don't have any claim for defamation if your brother thinks that the term 'lazy' is unfounded.

Their customer support is definitely improving, and miles ahead from what I've heard about EE. Their 4G speeds are pretty good too, I can get 60Mbps where I live with 20Mbps upload.

They haven't ever sent my a text message apart from informing me that my eBill is ready and roaming prices.

Their coverage is good too, they actually have a partnership with EE and share eachothers masts for 3G so 3G/HSDPA+ coverage is almost identical.

4G coverage is bad compared to other providers, there is a reason for that though, other providers charge to use 4G whereas Three give it for no extra cost. I suppose this means they are doing a more gradual rollout so as to keep things cheaper.

I have bad signal inside my house from all providers, I decided to call Three to see if there was anything they could do to help that.

This is not because I am a person who does not get emotionally invested into stories - hell, I certainly do. I sometimes have to remind myself that it isn't real to prevent myself from totally breaking down. I don't just watch, I feel every emotion carried through.

So why do I not feel that with Doctor Who?

Well, I sometimes feel like the emotion is forced. It isn't allowed to progress as naturally as it used to; compare, for example, the previous series finale with the one where Rose left. The recent one was pretty much entirely people standing around, talking. The only exception was that scene where the Cybermen were attacking that plane, but even that was slightly pathetic. Clearly, all effort was put into the emotional side of it. Yet the other finale, I feel, felt so much more natural and heartbreaking; there was an all-out wat between the Daleks and the Cybermen, yet the thing that really gripped me was how Rose exited. I couldn't believe it. I didn't believe it at first. It was devastating... And that, along with the 10th Doctor's regeneration, were the only two things that ever really emotionally gripped me. I didn't get that in this finale. At all. Despite the fact that it desperately tried.

And maybe this is just me not liking the Moffat era of Who. Maybe it is a contributing factor to that. I will admit, it is more (although not entirely) present now that we have Clara and the 12th Doctor, my least favourite companion and Doctor to date, by quite some way. Maybe I just can't connect with them. But this has been boiling inside of me for a few years now.

And in a way it has seeped into the other aspects of the storyline, too, like the fact that in the last series NO ENEMY WAS TRULY EVIL. There always had to be a reason why they were misunderstood or something. The only exceptions were the Daleks, Cybermen and Missy (the first two of which have kind of lost something about them in recent series) and the 2D monsters (which was by far my standout episode of the series). I just don't get why every single monster needs to get the emotional treatment as well. One or two, yeah, but not a whole series worth!

So yeah. It might be unpopular, but I don't like the emotional side of Doctor Who. Anyone want to fight me in that?",null,0,null,1440808160,null,null,false,0,cuj9hoi,null,t3_3ipria,null,null,null,t3_3ipria,null,null,null,1441559638,null,1,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

For example, to quote the article:

&gt; The tables turn once young adults reach their 20s. The same research found that women typically earned Â£1,111 more than men. But, the situation flips again in their 30s when men tend to land most senior well-paid positions â suggesting that there is a âdrop-off pointâ in womenâs careers after which they have to play catch up.

I mainly posted it because of the pretty eye-catching statistic about the fall in wages for teenage girls, but it does seem to raise some other important points, such as there is a certain amount of evidence that older women are somewhat at a disadvantage in the job market compared to other categories of employees. For example, what I quoted above and the quote that 'despite the Equal Pay Act being introduced 40 years ago female managers earn around 22 per cent less than their male counterparts' - does the huge amount of information you have provide a counterargument to this point?

Also, the names of the stops on those screens is totally different to what Google Maps or anything else gives, so if you don't know what all the side-streets around the stop you want are called, you're unlikely to find your stop *even if they are bothering*. Combine this with multiple different companies, no through ticketing, half the stops just having times like ""well it stops at this other stop before this one then, so it'll be here in this ten minute range""â¦ except then most of the time it's even later than that range allows, and most of the stops outwith the city-centre don't have any bus tracking times (and I've seen them claim ""now"" till the bus arrives when it takes more like ten minutes till the bus appearsâ¦ I'm dubious they're anything but time-table based most of the time).

While I agree with you that it would probably be wrong to get rid of Corbyn, or try to, as soon as he's elected (if he is), ultimately the leader of the PLP does need to actually have the support of more than a couple dozen members of the PLP. I do think they should give him a chance. I wasn't such a big fan of moving to an open AV-OMOV system to elect the leader of the PLP anyway. The way the Tories elect their leader by narrowing it down to two candidates among MPS before putting it to the membership seems like a better way to do it. You get a better debate between two candidates than between four, anyway.

I'd support the party because I support the aims and values of it. They are the best chance we have of stopping the Tory government - which is not comparable to a Labour government no matter what Corbyn supporters (which might not include you here) say. They represent the right side in the ongoing struggle for equality, even if they aren't always perfect in doing so; no major party can be.

Not sure how inspiring he is - that really remains to be seen. Right now he's inspiring enough to have people pay Â£3 and fill in an online form, but that's based on what he isn't rather than what he is. Will that materialize into grassroots campaigning that might win us an election? I think by the next election they will have all melted away - and possibly even decided Corbyn himself is just another 'red Tory', having been tainted by pragmatism and reality. We'll have to see.

Basically, you give money to the team in exchange for the player, player is now your player, standard.

Champions League is a European competition consisting of the best teams from each European League, top 4 from England, top 4 from Spain, top 4 from Germany, top 3 from Italy, top 3 from France etc etc, how many teams each league gets is determined by their UEFA co-efficient which is determined by how well the teams do in European competition but that's not really important now.

In order to be confidential, information must contain the necessary quality of confidence and must be disclosed in circumstances which import an obligation of confidence. Given that the disclaimer often appears at the bottom of theÂ email and is read after theÂ emailÂ itself, it seems unlikely that an obligation of confidence could be said to apply.

I'll leave the intricacies of the transfer system to someone else - in America, there's usually a salary cap and all sorts of other complicated stuff I can never seem to wrap my head around. There's not as much regulation here, though there is a bit - but again, someone else can explain it better. 

The Champions League is a tournament held by the UEFA that features the previous seasons' top teams from different leagues around the world. Just like England has the EPL, all European nations have their own domestic leagues. How many teams from each country can participate depends on a complicated coefficient. For now, England's Top 3 finishers from the previous season automatically qualify, and the 4th team have to play a qualifier to get into Europe. 

One of our (Liverpool)'s key goals this season is a Top 4 finish because it means the possibility of playing in the Champions League which comes with financial benefits as well as the ability to attract top talent. This season, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City &amp; Man Utd. will represent England in the Champions League. 

There is the Europa League too - which features the European teams below those that qualified for the CL. Liverpool will play in the Europa League this season, having finished 6th last season. Not as prestigious as the CL, but important for us to do well here. 

Now as for our history - there is a lot of it. We've had legendary managers, won all there is to win and are based in city with a very strong identity and culture in and of itself. We've won 18 Leagues, 7 FA Cups (a domestic cup (knock-out) tournament), and 5 times Champions League winners. For all our historic success, we've also experienced tragedy and bad times. 

Here are some resources:

Our key rivalries are with what you'd call 'cross-town' Everton (same city, just a park away) and Manchester United. Prior to that, Nottingham Forest &amp; Leeds United (everyone hates them). Currently, Chelsea is a team that really roils us. 

We've had some famous victories and legendary players - of which you'll hear and see a lot during match commentaries or while getting to know the club.

Differences between the genders in terms of wages are not just down to social norms but ultimately meet biology's hard limits. A woman dropping out of work to care for children will drag down the statistics for those that do. 

Men also choose fields that are higher paying with a high growth in salary over the long term. They also tend to work longer hours and for a greater period of their life. 

To put it bluntly there is no issue with a pay gap between genders, the real issue is the pay gap between bottom level workers and CEOs. This isn't a gender issue but a class issue imo.

History - Liverpool has a long and storied history, which others can better educate you about than I can. The high-water mark in recent memory was the 2005 Champions League final. It's available in its entirety on YouTube - go watch it :) 

Liverpool have won more European trophies than any other English team, although not since the inception of the Champions League. We have won the top flight of the English table (now called the Premier League) eighteen times -- sadly, not since 1989-90. Our most recent trophy win was the League/Carling Cup in 2012.  We came very close to winning the league in the 2013-2014 season.

Our phrase is ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" which is also the club anthem. It is played at the start of every home game, and the fans all sing along. When a Liverpool home game is the game of the week on NBC, they're usually pretty good about starting the coverage early enough to show the stadium singing along to the song.

Major figures in the history of the club include managers Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, and ""King"" Kenny Dalglish. Steven Gerrard just retired (*sob*) as our captain after playing for the club for seventeen years and captaining the side for most of that. He now plays for the LA Galaxy. Jamie Carragher also played for the club for seventeen years and was Gerrard's vice-captain for over half of that time. Our current captain is Jordan Henderson.

In the sadder side of Liverpool's history, there have been two major stadium disasters: Heysel and Hillsborough. Heysel was in 1985 at the European Cup final in Brussels between Liverpool and Juventus. A confrontation between Liverpool and Juve fans in the stadium led to 39 people, mostly Juve fans, being crushed and killed. There is bad blood between the clubs to this day, despite attempts to smooth it over. 

You may have heard of the Hillsborough disaster; there was an excellent ESPN 30 for 30 episode on it fairly recently. In 1989, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest traveled to the FA Cup semi-final, held at Hillsborough Stadium. Due to a variety of factors, there was a bottleneck of fans at the turnstile and the police opened a gate to let the fans in. This led to the crushing deaths of 96 fans. The tragedy continued, though, when the Sun (I'm spelling it out now, but you will very often see it here and on other Liverpool forums as the S*n) newspaper and police lied about the cause of the deaths, saying that Liverpool fans were drunk and dangerous and that some had even urinated on the dead bodies. After decades of advocacy by the victims' families, there was finally a government inquest and blame was shifted where it belonged - to incredibly lax stadium security and emergency response. You will hear the phrase ""Justice for the 96"" or JFT96 around this forum and others. The yearly anniversary is one of the few times Everton (our local rival) and Liverpool will put aside their differences, as both sides have fans who lost family members and friends in the tragedy.",null,0,null,1440814907,null,null,false,0,cujcu6e,null,t3_3istis,null,null,null,t3_3istis,null,null,null,1441561215,null,4,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

&gt; To put it bluntly there is no issue with a pay gap between genders, the real issue is the pay gap between bottom level workers and CEOs. This isn't a gender issue but a class issue imo.

I would agree with this point but I still think it is more nuanced, and that it is not an either/or problem. There is certainly an issue with pay gap between the bottom level workers and the CEOs, and there does appear to be some inequalities between genders when it comes to pay when age is a factor in the equation, and possibly not just because of biological reasons. But this does not mean that either should be ignored, or not given our full scrutiny - both class and gender issues which still exist should be paid attention to. From the data I have seen though, the issue concerning class, or disparity of wages between different levels of employees, is much more pronounced than that of gender, and very little is being done to counteract this issue.",null,0,null,1440815223,null,null,false,0,cujczmc,null,t3_3iskn5,null,null,null,t1_cujci67,null,null,null,1441561352,null,5,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

The House of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha (Windsor) went extinct in the male line with George VI, yet Elizabeth II has maintained the legal fiction of Windsor for her heirs by royal proclamation with the assistance of Winston Churchill on 9 April, 1952.  

If you really want to look into the sinister dynastic history of Europe, consider the following: Catholics are still barred from the English throne. The English monarchy will not permit a Catholic monarch because it would disqualify their entire familial line of succession since William III, Prince d'Orange in 1689 with the deposition of James II and VII.  The rightful Jacobite pretender is actually Franz, Duke of Bavaria, the great-grandson of Ludwig III and the current head of the House of Wittelsbach.  For obvious reasons, no members of the House of Wittelsbach press their claim on the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The corpse of Richard III was unearthed in Leicester in September 2012, and the ""House of Windsor"" was reluctant for state or royal events since this was not their direct ancestor; in fact, their royal line is further predicated on their descent from the first Tudor, Henry VII, which in turn created the hostile propaganda toward the last Plantagenet.

So i think we should stop to talk about these situations as the same. Markovic situation on the other hand does not look good for now. He certainly have the talent, but seems like he was bought 1 year too early. But we did not have the chance to let him develop there for another season, as we do now. 

The players from now on will be in another situation than we had a couple of years ago. They will either be first team starters as Clyne, Benteke and Firmino. Those will be expensive and expected to start right away or players like Gomez and Ings who are expected to add depth and develop in the team. We now got the luxuary to spend x amount of millions on players like Markovic hoping he will be a star. 

Another point to add is that the first couple of years it seems like there was a difference in who the committee and Rodgers wanted, this got us in a situation where we did buy flops. I am not saying Rodgers is always correct, because then we would not have Coutinho and Sturridge. But it honestly seems like so far they have gotten it way better this season than the last couple of years.

If you do what everyone else does, expect to have the same results as everyone else. 

If your authentic in your approach and come across as a likable person that they would enjoy working with they will want to hire you. But if they don't hire you then at least your tried something different than the traditonal emailing of your cv and cover letter that everyone else does.

null,null,YoungFoxyandFree,present,null,null,"&gt; I am still waiting for some ""far from no-name"" prospect to become big as e.g Fabregas or Costa. So far this policy has not turned out to be as succesful as we would have wanted.

Firstly, while you have not made this comparison directly, the context of this thread suggests you believe John Stones should be compared to Fabregas and Costa as a purchase who has ""already established himself on the highest level"" who will walk into the starting XI. Yes he has proven to be PL quality, but he has never played in the CL and he certainly wouldn't walk into the starting XI. The only reason he is so expensive is because he is young and English and Chelsea is so interested because a young, English defender would be an ideal purchase. There are other defenders in different leagues that are comparable to Stones in quality, but are half his price. And similar to Stones, they aren't playing for elite clubs and wouldn't necessarily walk into the team. If his name was Jean Pierre and he played for Nice, you'd probably consider him a ""no name."" 

But I digress. So, if I have this straight, you are waiting for someone that Chelsea has purchased, who is not already a world class player/starter, to become a successful contributor at an elite level a la Fabregas or Costa? Or, put more objectively, someone who would be a guaranteed starter when healthy for a CL level/title challenging team in the top European leagues? Hmmm, lets see:

* **Dave** - It took him awhile to get his starting spot and his nickname suggests he was not that well-known outside of the French league before he became one of the best fullbacks (RB playing LB) in England.

* **Ivanovic** - Came from the Russian league. Didn't play at all in his first season (came in January) and struggled to get into the Reserve XI. Has been one of the better right fullbacks (playing there as a CB) during his time. 2x PFA TOTY, CL TOTY, Europa final MOTM.

* **Courtois** - He would have played for Chelsea earlier if not for Cech, but he still came from Belgium (not quite the highest level) and was not ready to play for Chelsea upon being purchased. He is now almost unanimously regarded as a top 5 GK in the world.

* **Kevin de Bruyne** - Obviously not still with us, but that had less to do with his ability than it did Chelsea's style of play. I'm not saying he's successful because of Chelsea but he was a prospect buy and he is now leading a CL level Wolfsburg and is seemingly close to making a huge move to an elite club. He also came from the Belgian league. KdB on signing for Chelsea: ""To come to a team like Chelsea is a dream but now I have to work hard to achieve the level that's necessary.""

* **Cech** - Reaching back a little bit into a different time in the club's history and Petr was also a highly talented young keeper, but still, he was bought from the French league as a backup. The rest is history.

* **Oscar** - Maybe a reach for this list as he came into the team pretty quickly, but I don't think he was a household name and certainly had not ""already established himself on the highest level.""

One for the future:

* **Zouma** - While he has played a decent amount since he arrived from France, he still has not cemented his starting spot and no one (not even Jose) would have thought he would have played this much already. We can't predict the future, but all signs point to him being an absolute stud of a player sooner rather than later.

I'm not commenting on this Chinese guy I know nothing about and obviously its impossible to hit on every transfer, but its ridiculous to say that none of Chelsea's ""no name,"" as you define them, transfers have developed into top quality players. It goes both ways too. If we are ""unlucky"" with our prospects, I don't know what the word is for some of our past established buys: Sheva, Torres, Cuadrado. Your example, Filipe Luis, an established player, never solidified a First XI spot. He was more a Salah than a Costa in terms of his results on the pitch for Chelsea. We'll see about Baba. And Pedro has played one match.

Many world class players were at some point ""no name"" players that developed in a natural progression of smaller teams before one of the top clubs picked them up, so its actually a widespread and highly successful transfer policy.",null,0,null,1440820800,null,null,false,0,cujfggp,null,t3_3iq1l3,null,null,null,t1_cuioe6d,null,null,null,1441562515,null,2,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Actually, [over 600,000](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2015/sty-net-migration.html) immigrate to live in the UK every year.

It is certainly easier if you are an EU citizen, as this guarantees you the right live and work in the UK.  However, as almost half of all immigrants come from outside the EU, it is certainly far from necessary.

According to our last census, White British are a minority in Greater London so it is unsurprising you met an ethnically diverse group of people.  However, it is likely most of those you met were just as 'British' as any other citizen.

Second point, 'eventually he will go and we will replace him. It's what we do, we are everton' making this statement means you don't have any trust at all for either the board or the manager. The board has spoken out and said not for sale, same with Martinez as well as adding we are trying to build something here, and john is a big part of that. So say we get his mind set on everton and his job which I think we can now we've said no to the request. few more signings push for either 4th, 5th or winning a cup, any of those gets us in Europe again even better if it's 4th CL is massive, we would be running in the same competitions as Chelsea, so what would he leave for? to win the BPL? maybe but there would be no guarantee he would, probably more of a chance but city look like a force for the next few years.",null,0,null,1440823510,null,null,false,0,cujgjot,null,t3_3iszln,null,null,null,t3_3iszln,null,null,null,1441563029,null,9,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,9,null

In particular the close family links with people who've been settled in the UK for over half a century now means that in some cases it's comparatively straightforward for other family members to come here.

But on the other hand, while there were parts of the Arab world administered by the British pre-WW2 (i.e. Palestine and Iraq), that administration was done under a League of Nations mandate and they were never considered full members of the British Empire.

Anyway a mate of mine is a burlesque dancer and I think she'd have an issue with this. She's an alternative girl with a well paid job who spent months constructing this rather clever narrative performance in her spare time and without giving too much away (I reckon if you searched a description of her performance you'd be able to identify her and blah which wouldn't be fair, so take my word for it) it was pretty decent. I mean the total nudity on all the performances from the night I saw her was like 20 seconds...like a cheeky reveal or something. 

I don't really like burlesque myself but she enjoys it, finds it empowering (a far greater degree of women in the audience already changes the demographic of who it appeals to, and if you ask me that alone takes it away from assosciations with seedy strip clubs, money in bikinis and lap dances). 

Anyway it's an adult performance, for adults, but the atmosphere, the intention of the performance, the people watching and the environment are all completely different to a strip club, which is actively attempting to stimulate sexual response, whereas burlesque is way, way more passive...it's just completely different. I say this is as a straight, red blooded male....really, really difficult to get a hard on at some cheeky, quaint little evening...it's like a carry-on movie compared to a porno.

Celtic are 46th in the UEFA coefficient rankings.

Look at the nations who are also around 5,000,000 and their ""best"" teams...

**Denmark** -  FC KÃ¸benhavn (77th)   
**Finland** - HJK Helsinki (152nd)   
**Ireland** - Shamrock Rovers FC (274th)   
**Slovakia** - 	Å K Slovan Bratislava (166th)   
**Norway** - Rosenborg BK (142nd)   
 
We are actually *over-achieving* in comparison to out European pals.

We also have the added disadvantage of being next door to the most over-inflated, over-hyped &amp; over-invested league on the planet. So they suck up all the TV airtime and money etc.

The problem lies in the gulf between 1st and 2nd in this country. Celtic may be 46th, but their nearest neighbors (Motherwell) are 217th. Other leagues may have a couple of teams who can get into European competition, therefore playing against the same kind of teams week-in-week-out, whereas Celtic only meet a team like this 2 or 3 times a season.

It's all down to money...

I've always resented the fact that companies like Haliburton and Shell only take out advertising boards at Pittodrie instead of pouring some of their pocket change into the team *then* throwing up some ad boards. Aberdeen could be a force in Europe if one of these oil companies decided it wanted to invest in the city they are based in *at all*!

* David Tennent was not all that good and possibly the most overrated character in the history of fiction.

* Rose Tyler is the worst NuWho companion, and one of the worst of all Doctor Who

* NuWho itself is nowhere near as good as Classic Who or Big Finish, so go there instead.

* Collin Baker is one of the best Doctors to come out of the show.

* Paul McGann IS the best Doctor, and the closest to a completely perfect portrayal of the character there has ever been.

* Stephen Moffat has had his time running the show, and his arcs a slowly becoming more predictable, not that they were much to begin with

* No that does not mean I want Russel T. Davies back, just get a new sodding head writer. Preferably more than one.

* Adrian Lester should be the next Doctor, this is not up for discussion, this is a empircal fact.

* A Female CAN play the doctor, and the Doctor is not and has never been a purely male figure

As a result, a swan would be more likely to break their own wing if they struck an adult human's arm.

null,null,theYword,null,null,null,"I answered that plenty elsewhere in the thread. He can't beat a man from standing and his game centers around pace and a decent shot. I care about the fee because I care about seeing the club progress. 22 million on Son is 22 million that won't go on players that would actually see us develop us as a club. Plus, as supporters of the club its our fucking money, whether you are watching at WHL, on SKY or on NBC.

In terms of what we actually need, I don't buy the argument that we don't have enough going forward. Where we are lacking is a deep lying midfielder who can pull and stretch an opposition who are sitting deep. At the moment we are playing with Eric Dier in that position and his ability to orchestrate the midfield in games where we are dominant is questionable. Mason and Bentaleb are slightly better bets but not by much. In the past Luka and before that Carrick where the keys to successful and solid home form which is something that has been of concern under Poch.

Given that, there are several players that I would have preferred. Obviously Schneiderlin would have been great but we can't compete with United (even still his fee was only just a little more than Son). Even Cabaye (who I admit is probably a little too old) was available for just 10 million and Spurs turned him down. I would say some like Wanyama is too much physical and doesn't have the passing range to play this role at a club like Spurs. 

Everyone knows all this and its why we have been after Sven Bender (rumoured at 20 million). However if Levy has spent the remainder of the budget on Son, as well as spent time negotiating that deal rather than a player we actually need then it screams of desperation and an incoherent transfer strategy.

If you're applying to several programs, each SoP should be tailored to each specific program.  Of course there's going to be some overlap with what you say in each one, but they shouldn't be *too* similar or sound too generic.  The main thing you should address: what are your career aspirations and how will being in this program help you to achieve that.  Looking at the program's website is useful - does the program do anything special that other programs don't do (or do as well)?  If you're applying for a PhD, you should also list your research interests and such, but for a master's, it's not really necessary.

My essay was formatted as such: short intro (state your career aspirations here), a couple paragraphs on my experience (research projects, internships) that helped cultivate my interest in a career in econ, rest of the essay about why the program was perfect for me.  SOPs are quite short, typically 1-2 pages, so if there's still room, add whatever you feel is important that you think they should know.

Everyone formats theirs differently.  There isn't one way in which you *must* write it.  But, that's how I chose to do it, and I guess it worked because I got accepted.

Don't get me wrong....you can have nudity in performance art....and it's not stripping, but yea...

The hyper sexual way they move their bodies is not different enough to not call it stripping Imo

If the removal of clothes was a metaphor or had some kind of message...sure call it art...

But...

They remove the clothes, for the act of removing the clothes itself, with the understanding and in a way that's titillating

I'm glad to see that your claims about privatisation are, like your claims about TfL wastefulness, based 100% in your conversations with a single individual though. Who needs proof, right?

null,null,theBreadSultan,null,null,null,"Wanna know why talk talk customer service is so shit?

I shit you not...this is a 100% true story.

Years ago a recruitment firm, posted me in the talk talk inbound sales office. 
It was in Wimbledon at an office called BPS...if I remember correctly (they obv contracted out the work)

My job, was to take incoming enquiries and convert them into sales...standard stuff.

I've done this for many companies, as I'm good at it, its easy to get this kind of work, the money is ok (if your good), and its not too taxing so you still have the energy to find slightly more interesting work)

What I saw at talk talk shocked me.

The number at the top of the bill, would also cone through to us....but these were Cs calls, and wr could not help....even tho The Cs team were in the same building...a few floors below, we were unable to transfer calls...

Because the sales targets (and commission) were based on conversion rates, management had the odd idea, that if you didn't take too many calls, it would keep your conversion rate up...

The official way to handle a customer service call that came through to us was as follows.

1. Tell customer they have come thru to sales line, 
But you will try to put them thru to the correct dept.

2. Put customer on hold

3. Do fuck all...literally..read a book or something

4. After 7 minutes...talk to customer again, say Cs is really busy, advise them to try themselves and offer correct number for Cs

If customer was insistent you try again, put them on hold for another 5 minutes....then again offer the correct number.


Naturally I thought fuck that, and just gave people the number straight away, management didn't like that, especially when it wasn't hurting my conversion rate...

Another thing I did was tell people all about the cancelation fees, how much it would cost to reconnect back onto the bt network if they did ever want to leave...etc.

Again management were like what the fuck are you doing!!! Why are you telling people that...

Things started to get hairy, when despite not using their dodgy tricks, I was still top of the board....
They didn't like what I was doing...as it was making them look bad....

I managed to find a better job, and left after two weeks,
But whenever I hear people bitching about talk talk customer services, I'm always reminded of my days in talk talk...

Never seen such a clown operation in all my life, and I've seen some comedy set ups.

Be aware that international SWIFT transfers can be a mostly manual process.  As an example, your bank may send the money to an intermediary bank who does international transfers (whomever is on your BIC code, MIDL is HSBC for example) who sends the money to the intermediary BIC code bank in Japan, who process it manually and sends it internally to the receiving bank in Japan, who manually read the SWIFT message text and apply a credit to the receiving account.  It can take 3-5 working days in some cases for a SWIFT payment to clear.  Who is your bank?  To take an example, if you are with NatWest, their processing times are listed at http://personal.natwest.com/personal/life-moments/travel/international-payments/sending-money-abroad.html and vary from 1-2 days to 3-5 days depending.


A tip for the future, use dedicated international transfer services to get a better deal, better tracking and better information on what is happening. Read the guide at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/foreign-currency-exchange.


*tl'dr*: ring your bank's international transfer team and ask what is going on, then read [this](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/foreign-currency-exchange) so you get a better and quicker deal next time you need to move money.

Edit: If speaking to the international transfer team doesn't get you an acceptable response, make a complaint using the [Resolver](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/site/resolver) tool and keep escalating right up to the Financial Ombudsman.",null,0,null,1440841525,null,null,1440855092,0,cujlh5d,null,t3_3itts2,null,null,null,t3_3itts2,null,null,null,1441565417,null,9,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9,null

These are not really hard biological limits at all. Yes women biologically must give birth but that women rather than men or both care for children for 9 months is a social not biological (or at least not hard biologically) thing.

That women face severe penalties, in terms of promotion and pay, for an average of 18 months out of a 40-50 year career is a socio-economic thing. It doesn't need to be like that at all.

Besides the pay gap [exists even in childless women](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-10/young-childless-women-earn-more-than-men-fact-check/5712770).

&gt;Men also choose fields that are higher paying with a high growth in salary over the long term. They also tend to work longer hours and for a greater period of their life.

This is again largely a socially determined thing, society still tells men that they must work long hours and earn big money and tells women that for them other things matter more.

An element you missed is what skills and attitudes we as a society value in the workplace. So we prize aggressiveness and competitive spirit and other attributes which are traditionally regarded as male (and socialized into male children and out of females) and so advance individuals with them (most often males). Are they in fact the most economically useful? Perhaps cooperation and discussion and other traditionally female attributes (socialised into female children and out of males) would in fact make for better, more productive business.

Fundamentally how we work, how our economy pays people and what skills and attitudes we value is socially determined. We as a society are paying men more than women, often for the same work.



&gt;To put it bluntly there is no issue with a pay gap between genders

Just because a straight forward legal / political measure, that appears to give equality, doesn't fix the problem does mean there is no problem. The pay gap is a fact, it exists, the fact it is complex socio-economic problem makes it harder to understand and fix but its still there.",null,0,null,1440842710,null,null,false,0,cujlpk7,null,t3_3iskn5,null,null,null,t1_cujci67,null,null,null,1441565527,null,6,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

&gt; My second question ... I worry that 'generalist' could just be a euphemism for an unaccomplished, but popular, person, a schmoozer.

I have absolutely no idea which is why I'm not keen on HoL reform because I suspect that no-one else knows the answer either. The HoL is far from perfect but I think that it does a reasonable job of holding the commons to account at the moment. If we change it there's a significant risk that it would end up worse than it is, despite the best of intentions.

We can preserve the character of a place and still modernise it. Places like Soho being redeveloped is profoundly negative because it is known for the 'taboo' (or once taboo) culture which is apparently being driven out. For every Soho there is an Elephant and Castle, a bad development which really just needs replacing. We can't get rid of all the grotty little alleyways because they are part of London's history but we can pull down poor quality / low density housing and put up bigger, newer blocks to increase density.

Whether or not a skyscraper is ugly or in the wrong place is down to the developers / politicians, town planners get no say in the matter these days.

Edit: The real issue we have is that infrastructure is expensive and there isn't much room for it.

Underemployment is when someone feels like they're working beneath their station, no that they're in relative or absolute poverty. Zero-hours contracts are used by something like 1% of the working population, of which 2/3rds are happy with their hours.

&gt;such as inappropriate encouragement into self-employment (part of the reason for the UK's record high new startups and also very high failure rate). 

Agree with you there.

Plus, the idea that they have to be able to make an ""effective contribution,"" and have ""significant achievements"" etc raises the question as to whether the Commission can actually determine that.

There are 7 people currently on the Commission. Three of whom are nominated by political parties (Con, Lab, and Lib Dem). Then there's:

* Professor Peele (Associate Professor of Politics at Oxford)

* Lt-Col. Sir Malcolm Ross(a member of the Royal Household and Security Executive)

* Baron Dalston (Former lecturer in Law and RNIB Vice Chairman)

* Baron Kakkar (Professor of Surgery and the Commission Chairman)

It's difficult to complain about any of their credentials, but it's hard to argue that the commission isn't dominated by politics straight off the bat with the party representatives and Professor Peele. I'd question how any of them is able to say recognise when an engineer would make an effective contribution to the lords? Or someone with significant experience in IT? Either of whom would be immensely valuable when it comes to reviewing legislation regarding the government's white elephant projects like HS2 or Universal Credit.

There are a dozen ways it could be made better, I'd just like to see a few of them attempted in order to make the lords more effective.

null,null,tusksrus,,Do you regret voting for Corbyn yet?,null,"&gt;The fact that your and idiot and are supporting the most useless candidate is obvious to anyone who has an modicum of common sense.

Obvious = I can't explain it. Okay? Liz is clearly the best candidate m8, sadly she got overshadowed by the bearded ghost of Christmas past and a bunch of people who don't support Labour signing up for Â£3 pretending that they do.

&gt;Besides-what reasoning have you provided?

Reasoning for what? I asked you why I have made you feel better about voting for Corbyn. There's no logical reason why I would have. It's just an emotional, reactionary response from you. The whole Corbynista movement is based on reaction and self-indulgence, and that's why it will fail.

&gt;Why did you begin to make petty insults when I pointed out how pathetic your flair was?

I respond in kind. All I've said that you might be referring to here was, ""I suppose I shouldn't expect a decent grasp of logic from Corbyn supporters."" Is that what you mean? Because you'd been far ruder to me in every post beforehand. There's no tangible logical thought coming from you here, and that's entirely par for the course for that tendency.

&gt;Why do persist in lowering the standard of this sub reddit with your painful bias and inability to even respond without coming across as condescending and clueless?

Bias? This is an internet forum, and I am an individual. I am not a publication, or an historical source.

What is more pertinent is that historically, elected governments have been replaced by oppressive ones from various branches of the government, both elected and unelected, sometimes with very little warning.

Perhaps what is more likely however, is a long slide into a police state. Where slowly but surely we get used to implementing more and more mechanisms of control to keep us ""safe"" until those in Westminster have totalitarian levels of power. We should be extremely wary of that, because to quote Lord Acton ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

It's actually pretty easy. Ever tried to track down a homeless person? My local PCSOs do quite often, and homeless people can often take weeks to show back up.

Going off the grid is simple. You don't have to go into the countryside or build a cabin in the woods. You simply stop shaving, grab a sleeping bag, and put a sign in front of asking for change. The whole world will ignore you.

Even if I had to make a withdrawal from the bank every day, I could go off grid for a whole year without anyone finding me. 

If you want further proof of how easy it is to drop off the grid, do a Google search for missing persons reports nationwide and check the figures for yourself.

95': Leeds 2 - 1 Derby, Victory for Leeds away from home, first win of the season after a phenomenal strike from Chris Wood, deserved winner. Leeds being the better team in the first half, but Derby certainly coming out and bossing the second half but failing to find the net, great defensive display from Leeds. STILL UNDEFEATED MOT!!!.

95': Freekick given against Derby after Chris Wood's turn in the centre circle fools the Derby player.

94': Squeaky Bum Time, as Leeds do their best to soak up the pressure. Leeds get down the other end, and chew up some valuable time, at the corner flag.

93': Leeds camped in front of their own box, sitting very deep. Derby with all the possession.

90': 5 Additional Minutes given, somehow.

88': GOALLLLLLLLL LEEEEEEDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHRIS WOOD!!!!!!! After a great first touch on the edge of the box, he bangs it off the post and in. Great strike.

87': SUB DERBY Hanson off, Shotton on.

86': Possible chance for Derby, but the flag is raised after a flick on to Darren Bent.

84': Poor first touch from Darren Bent, after a 2 on 1 could have proved costly for Leeds, play is broken down instead.

81': Freekick Leeds, Baird tries to shepard Lewis Cook off the ball and gives away a foul.

80': Derby waste a freekick in a decent spot, goal kick to Leeds.

79': SUB DERBY Russel off, Bent on.

78':Derby down to 10, Keogh has to grab a new shirt after blood from the first half head knock gets on it.

77': Wood heads over the bar after a well worked cross from Antenucci, free header, should have scored.

76': SUB LEEDS Mowatt off, Antenucci on.

74': Quick break from Derby after Bamba gives away the ball on the edge of the Derby area. Results in a good block from Cooper after a shot from Weinmann.

73': Corner to Derby, lots of grappling inside the area, a Derby player goes to ground and there are half appeals for a penalty, nothing given.

72': YELLOW CARD to Hendrick: Late challenge outside the Leeds area.

71': Leeds freekick from halfway, swung into the area, results in a shot wide of the goal by Stuart Dallas.

69': SUB LEEDS Sam Byram being replaced by Luke Murphy.

67': Lack of communication between two Leeds players leads to a strike at goal from Martin, great save by Silvestri.

66': Tom Ince with a decent effort from the edge of the box, it clear the bar by a foot or so.

65': SUB DERBY Thorne comes off with a calf injury, replaced by Weinmann.

62': Cook drives into the Derby area, but a poor touch gives the ball away before he can pull the trigger.

54': Hendrick comes close for Derby, shoots from the edge of the 18 yard box, with no pressure and narrowly misses, should have scored.

52': Derby starting the second half much like Leeds finished the first, chasing every loose ball and keeping possession in dangerous areas.

48': GOAL Derby, following a stunning save from Silvestri, Chris Martin is allowed to turn on the edge of the Leeds area and fires the ball into the bottom corner, 1-1.",null,0,null,1440850243,null,null,1440853517,0,cujng0x,null,t3_3iu1b3,null,null,null,t3_3iu1b3,null,null,null,1441566344,null,16,null,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,16,null

null,null,tusksrus,,Do you regret voting for Corbyn yet?,null,"&gt; you muppet.

Think about what you're saying for a moment.

&gt;Your very flair is condescending

Yes, but I want to know why it made you feel better.

&gt;The vast majority of the Labour Party want Corbyn over Kendall.

""The Labour Party"". We'll see.

&gt;You are accusing people of people false Labour supporters which is no different from me accusing Liz of being a Red Tory. 

Well, no, since Tories aren't joining the party to vote for Liz Kendall. Why would they? She's got the best chance of taking them out of power. A whole slew of people from all across the spectrum are joining Labour to vote for Corbyn, though. That's not the same as saying everyone voting for Corbyn isn't a Labour supporter. Obviously.

&gt;So, only those who have voted New Labour in the past are allowed to choose the new leader? 

No.

&gt;Or are you actually complaining about Jeremy inspiring the grass roots?

No.

&gt;What reasoning do you require? 

I want to know why I have made you feel better about voting for Corbyn. Any logical reason will do, but I'm still waiting.

&gt;That you are stupid? 

Not a reason.

&gt; You are voting for a candidate whom has nothing to say.

Not a reason. Also untrue, I think you just have never looked, blinded by your Corbynmania. (You also want 'who' - 'whom' is for objects not subjects, but that's by the by.)

&gt;What are her policies? Transport? Tax? Industry? Financial regulation? Press Freedom/Leverson? Surveillance? She talks a lot and says absolutely nothing. Pointless.

Look them up, please. [Here's where to start](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-liz-kendalls-policies-heres-6268836). My personal favourites are allowing online strike ballots - a much better alternative to the affront to the freedom of assembly the Tory government has brought in with their bizarre minimum thresholds; extending the remit of the low pay commission, to help Britain's poorest; banning letting agent fees and introducing a register of private landlords, to help Britain's growing renting tenant sector; aiming for an economic surplus now we are in growth (classic Keynesian economics); and restricting benefits for EU migrants as a means of immigration control.

Baring in mind that a leadership election is about the person and not the policies - you'll want the NPF for that - I think it's a good start for where she stands on issues. No one has particularly fleshed out policies - particularly not Corbyn - and neither should they be expected to at this stage. 

She's the candidate with the best chance of occupying the centre ground and moving it leftwards. Sadly she got off to a bad start with that Kendall for Tory Leader nonsense, though if she had won that might have helped her in the end. 

I also like her because she looks to the future, not the past (like Corbyn and Cooper); and she represents a break from the Blair/Brown generation which, while I don't mind that generation particularly myself, has become electorally toxic. We need fresh blood at the top of the party - and in that I can understand an appetite for Corbyn as he's different too, but there's too much baggage from the 1970s as well as the very questionable links that have surfaced in recent weeks; in a similar but worse way to the other two having it from the 90s and 00s. 

&gt;She runs a campaign based on attacking Corbyn nothing more and then whines about a little online abuse? Pot, kettle, black much Liz?

I don't think that's what she's doing, but it's difficult when the whole debate has become about Corbyn, and you're always asked questions about Corbyn, to not give your honest opinion. None of it warrants any abuse, just because people disagree.

&gt;But Kendall is running a right wing platform inside the Labour Party, advocating austerity, welfare cuts, privatisation, Trident replacement... she even went as far as to say that Labour needed to be more right wing.

Right-wing is a bit far. She's on the right of the party, but she's still a left wing politician, come on. You might put yourself further left than I put myself on the spectrum, but she's not right of centre. Austerity is a buzzword - she wants to run a surplus now the economy is growing which is standard Labour economics. Welfare cuts don't exist in a vacuum, please don't compare it to the harmful rhetoric the Tories give on welfare. When Osborne made his budget speech where he misrepresented people on benefits as staying in bed 'with the blinds drawn'. I like to give new governments a chance, but that was when I knew for sure that I could never support the Tories. Kendall wouldn't be like that. She's Labour, and if you just listen to her for ten minutes, you'll see that she is as well. That doesn't make her not a pragmatist who sees that you don't get into power without making compromises - it's about finding the compromise that won't hurt the poor and disabled.

Trident replacement is totally not a right-wing thing. Plenty in Labour support Trident replacement. If you don't, that's perfectly legitimate, but it's far from Tory ground.

&gt;If people are attacking her on that basis, purely on policy, then fair game; I'm not about to stop attacking politicians over their actions and beliefs, just in case it hurts their feelings.

Benefits should be there to support the disabled, people that are sick or injured, anyone that has a dependant and those that are unemployed (transitional benefit). We can agree to that right?

Corbyn, on the other hand, is the only candidate, now that Burnham has had a change of heart, who has refused to indulge in personal attacks and negative campaigning. Even if you don't like what he stands for you have to concede that he has fought his campaign on his policies and made it clear that he will be inclusive if he wins and if he doesn't he will support whoever does win. In the Republican leadership debate Donald Trump was booed by Republicans for refusing to say that he would work with the candidate who wins if it isn't him. Whether it's the Republican party or the Labour Party members don't like it when candidates make it clear that they won't accept the democratic choice of the party if it doesn't conform with their personal views.

I already told you about your flair. Go practice your reading comprehension. But here it is again for the lazy: You have come out against Corbyn in a way that wasn't very thoughtful or measured and people are pushing you back - so continue sucking it up and stop sulking. You and you fellow blairites will be along the fringes in the future, the dye is cast. Keep trying but at this point no way in hell she will be leader. And even in the event of a defeat your being a 'thorn' on the side Corbyn just further confirms your attitude. This is about us the labour supporters searching for a leader who represents our feelings, hopes and aspirations. Your flair makes me happy about my vote for Corbyn because it confirms that your are completely blind to any reason and unwilling to even reasonable debate-you arrogantly believe to dictate others choices. As I have already told you it is pointlessly inflammatory and indeed, the pathetic outcry of a teenager who has very little real world experience and spites everyone for disagreeing with him.

I'm sure we can get him for less, too, since the Corinthians owner has come out and asked for people to buy him. The club is desperate to get rid because they're having financial issues. This is the kind of deal we really should take a chance on. 

Besides, wasn't Soldado proven? He was top 5 scorer in Spain for years before we bought him. Lamela was a superstar in Italy
Before we bought him. Paulinho lit up Brazil and the Confederations Cup before we bought him. Every transfer is a risk. A well-known player that knows very well where the goal is and has, despite what you're trying to say, proven himself at the highest level for under Â£8M is definitely worth a shot.

null,null,LinuxMage,eu,Luffbra,null,"Its an interesting one. Like I say, I lived ""off-grid"" for about a year. I rented a house with cash, and worked for someone in cash. I was in a remote area with no phone lines, and so far from a mobile phone mast that they didnt work. The only people that vaguely knew me were the owners of the local shop where I bought food, the guy i worked for, and the woman I rented the house from. 

The house's electricity supply was a key/card meter (pay as you go), and as far as the utilities were concerned, everything was in the landlords name. If asked, the landlord would say the house was being looked after by a relative. 

If I needed to communicate with the outside world, I went to the nearby city and used a cybercafe. However, it wasn't my actual intention at the time to live entirely off-grid, so I didn't hide from the net. 

Now, the disclaimer here is that I wasnt in the UK as such; I was in the Republic of Ireland, and lived/worked in Connemara, west of Galway. 

You could do exactly as I did in the highlands of Scotland or outer hebrides and still be classed as in the UK. It would be even easier in Northern Ireland, as you can go across the border into the republic and live in Donegal or Sligo. 

I *was* being pursued by the UK authorities though. All my family was willing to tell them (they have since died) was that I was ""somewhere in Ireland, they didnt know where, and hadn't heard from me recently"". I was being chased by the CSA for child maintenance, and owed about Â£20K. When I was in Ireland, I actually found a entire group of UK ""refugees"" living nearby who were there for exactly the same reason.  I was told NOT to cross any checked borders, but it was really easy to still come back into the mainland UK to see family without being caught simply by using an irish registered car, and buying tickets at the docks in cash from the ferry company. Also, I only used off-peak (mostly midnight) crossings, so they were generally not checking cars going through.

Last year while working during Calvin Harris (or whatever the event was called then) I had residents arrive back to the hotel way after the event way finished as they had to walk to the hotel. Based in the city centre.


Hopefully this year they have some sort of transportation infrastructure in place as it's just crazy to hold such a big event generating a lot of revenue into the local economy the least they can do is have a douzen or so coaches dropping people into the city centre.

null,null,tusksrus,,Do you regret voting for Corbyn yet?,null,"&gt;""Give second preferences to anyone but Corbyn""

Why's that a personal attack? Anyone but Corbyn is a legitimate point of view - we want Labour to have at least 200 seats after the next election, ideally a majority.

&gt;Grow up.

&gt;Thankfully your just a fringe group of the party and most others are not as short sighted.

&gt;Go practice your reading comprehension.

These are personal attacks.

&gt;Corbyn, on the other hand, is the only candidate who has refused to indulge in personal attacks and negative campaigning.

""We can't go on being Tory-lite [so vote for me because the other three are].""

&gt;made it clear that he will be inclusive if he wins

He doesn't have a choice, given he has virtually no support within the PLP. It's not a virtue as much as a product of necessity.

It's not that they wouldn't work with him - it's that there's no possible way it could work. You can't be having fundamental disagreements within the Shadow Cabinet because you stop it working entirely. That's why Corbyn went back on his idea to bring back (as always... it's bringing stuff back) shadow cabinet elections. Because he saw it could never work. Kendall could never be in a Corbyn Shadow Cabinet, just like how Corbyn could never have been in any previous Labour Shadow Cabinet. She'd have to leave almost immediately once they start banging on about ridiculous ""People's"" QE and maximum wages. I think that applies to a large part of the PLP.

It totally makes sense to hedge your bets when Corbyn might not even last the full five years. You don't want to be tainted by him.

&gt;You have come out against Corbyn in a way that wasn't very thoughtful or measured and people are pushing you back - so continue sucking it up and stop sulking.

But why does it make you feel better? I don't think I'm going to get an answer to this. :/

&gt;Keep trying but at this point no way in hell she will be leader.

Well, obviously not this time. You said she was a wasted first preference, but there's no such thing in AV. I definitely want to register with the party my support for the direction she wanted to take the party in.

&gt;And even in the event of a defeat your being a 'thorn' on the side Corbyn just further confirms your attitude.

When did I say that? I think I wrote a fairly long paragraph or two saying the opposite. And you lecture me about reading comprehension?

&gt;This is about us the labour supporters searching for a leader who represents our feelings, hopes and aspirations.

But when it's to the exclusion of pretty much everybody else, and he's guaranteed to lose an election, and thousands more poor and disabled people will suffer and die as a result under the harsh reality of a Tory government... can you really say he represents your hopes and aspirations?

&gt;Your flair makes me happy about my vote for Corbyn because it confirms that your are completely blind to any reason and unwilling to even reasonable debate

Does it? Why? That's not a reason to be happy anyway, why would you be happy about that? Logic...

&gt;you arrogantly believe to dictate others choices. 

No? You're just making things up about me now.

I'm tired of your personal attacks, while accusing me of personal attacks, downvoting my every post, and refusing to engage in logical and intelligent debate. Got shopping to do, I'll see you around.

Let me know in a year or two when we're hemorrhaging support in local elections, whether or not you regret voting for Corbyn. Chances are, you'll blame some irrelevant reason or foreseeable consequence as a means of maintaining cognitive dissonance, but never mind.

null,null,sharklazers99,null,null,null,"It's true there would have been a conflict but without western governments getting involved it would have been short, sharp and over very quickly.

What lead to the war escalating to the level it has and to the rise of ISIS was western intervention. The enormous amount of weapons we sent, the political cover we gave to Turkey and Jordan to not only train jihadists but also send ing weapons and cash and use their country as safe havens was the cause of all of this.

Right now it's possible for jihadists who belong to AQ to train and then launch attacks into Syria from Turkish territory without Turkey suffering any international fall out. If the Syrian government attacks the staging area our governments will help Turkey do it's best to anihilate the Syrian Army and Airforce who are only trying to defend their country.

In 2010 before the war started ISIS was just a bunch of guys hiding in the Iraqi desert and in Iraqi prisons. The political cover we gave to Syrian rebels and jihadists allowed ISIS to enter Syria in 2011 and rebuild themselves. We thought at first that we could use these jihadists to topple Assad and then take over but ISIS isn't run by idiots. Every time weapons were sent in ISIS managed to get their heads in. All the times we turned a blind eye to forgien fighters entering Syria (through western allied countries) they went to join ISIS.

I blame Labour for the original war but the difference is that when Bush left office, he cleaned up most of his mess. Cameron, Sarkozy, Hollande and Obama have not only managed to create an even bigger mess but they have no way of cleaning it up. They have failed in every single way. 

They failed to topple Assad and made him even more popular. They failed to isolate Iran and made them even more popular. Thousands of westerners have been radicalied and are coming back home. Our allies in the Mid East such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey have become weaker because the world has seen then for who they are. They have thousands of jihadists in their own country that hate them. Tens of thousands of Syrians are making their way to Europe after we helped destroy their country and they are going through Libya, another country we helped destroy.

&gt;Mummy is too busy working to properly raise and even feed the child. 

You literally can't into reading comprehension. That Â£17,500 is **without** working. The parent is home full-time to raise their child. And not being able to feed the child? Are you nuts?

&gt;People don't deserve a living wage?

It's not about deserving a living wage or not, it's about what the economic value of your work is. Justin King is totally right in his assessment that pushing the minimum wage up will just result in faster modernisation of supermarkets so they have to employ fewer people. They'll take on one highly-skilled IT technician to look after their checkouts for every ten checkout bods they sack.

&gt;Benefits should be there to support the disabled, people that are sick or injured, anyone that has a dependant and those that are unemployed (transitional benefit). We can agree to that right? 

Yes.

&gt;If someone is in work, no matter what their role, they deserve to be able to live from that wage.

No they don't. If you can't produce work that adds value greater than the minimum wage then you're unemployable. That transitional benefit you just mentioned becomes an effective employer-of-last resort, except they don't actually work for payment.

&gt;1.2 million people...

The solution isn't to price them out of the market. Those people clearly have a skill shortfall, or a disability of some description or some other reason for their poor economic performance. You don't make a working population taller by banning the employment of short people. You ensure they're able to make themselves more economically viable as workers.

For what it's worth, I support a negative-income tax form of minimum-income with a view to replace most benefits as well as the minimum wage. People should be as free as is reasonably possible to better themselves throughout their life so having a minimum wage is a moot point.",null,0,null,1440853843,null,null,1440854239,0,cujojaa,null,t3_3ithf6,null,null,null,t1_cujo3ro,null,null,null,1441566858,null,-3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

Liz is a petty, tireless attention seeker. She has absolutely zilch to recommend her. Her articles are the limit of inanity and sheer bad writing. Even compare to miracles of inanity like Cooper and Burnham (he of the agonized look) she is appalling.

Corbyn has never ruled out serving in any of the other candidates' Shadow Cabinets, should they win. He has always called of cooperation. Kendall and Cooper have ruled him out.
