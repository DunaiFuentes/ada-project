Nothing particularly vile or original about the abuse and it doesn't seem there was a massive amount of it if they've only found three tweets - but the papers would have been searching for this as it makes a good story for them. I'm sure Jack is level-headed enough to not let things like this affect his decision, there are idiot football fans supporting every team and every country. 

Personally, I would love him to play for Ireland because I support Ireland and I love the idea of our Ireland/Villa links continuing. I think he's got the potential to become an absolute legend for the Irish national team, he could be playing for them for the next 15 years and if he helps them get to a tournament then he'll be a hero. The 'English born' aspect isn't an issue for most Irish football fans - Ireland has a unique history of emigration and there's a sense of pride if the diaspora want to represent their original 'homeland'.  

But then I can see the appeal of waiting to see if he would get a chance for England, knowing he's more likely to go to World Cups and European Championships, but equally there's every chance he would be a bit-part player and in and out of squads. Look at Ashley Young - when he was at his peak with us we all would have thought he would be an England regular for years. 

When he was coming up through the youth teams there was a core of first/second/third generation Irish players in the Villa set-up who were all going off to international matches together, so there was very much a sense of community around the youth levels he played at. Now he's playing alongside two England internationals in Delph and Cleverley, so it's not hard to see his head being turned. 

From a selfish Villa point of view, I also think it would be better for us if he declares for Ireland - there's very much been a pattern in recent years of Villa players getting called up and then going off to play elsewhere and I think it's more than just a case of other teams recognising the same quality that earned them a call-up, but they're spending time on England duty with players from top four clubs, talking about their Champions League exploits and trophy cabinets - so again it's not hard to see how players have their heads turned and want to move on to 'better' things.  

Personally, I think M'ON could have handled this better - he's almost hanging Jack out to dry a little by being so honest about him turning down the call-up, and opening him up to this abuse. He could have just said it was decided it was best to let him concentrate on getting this season out of the way first.

contextual material which emphasises the benefits of Maths to people who have been 'turned off' by the subject.
The Functional Mathematics specification is suitable for students of various ages and from diverse background in terms of lifelong learning.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Prime Minister**

&gt;His Royal Highness corresponded with the Prime Minister on issues of particular concern including supporting hill farmers, bovine tuberculosis (TB), procuring British produce including British beef and challenges for the dairy sector.

&gt;The correspondence about bovine TB centres on the rising number of TB cases in cattle and the cost to the taxpayer. It also refers to a study of the impact of badger culling in the Republic of Ireland, which showed the efficacy of culling in reducing badger infection. For the dairy sector, most farmers were making no profit on the production of milk and some were making considerable losses.

&gt;The letters deal with the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, and help that could be provided to farmers who were struggling to cope with the new business processes.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Minister for Environment**

&gt;The Prince of Wales had raised concerns about the plight of the albatross for some time. One of the main reasons for their decline was thought to be due to Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing.

&gt;The Prince of Wales wrote to the then Fisheries Minister, following a letter about the work of the High Seas Task Force (HSTF). The HSTF emerged in 2003 from the Round Table on Sustainable Development. This committee of ministerial representatives from a small group of countries was formed to address the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas, a practice which was adversely affecting albatross numbers.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry**

&gt;The former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wrote to The Prince of Wales to say that she had met with the charity In Kind Direct (founded by The Prince of Wales in 1996) to hear about the charity’s work.

&gt;Patricia Hewitt said she is unable to help with any funding for In Kind Direct. She also said she has tried to assist by introducing them to various other public sector bodies or to other government colleagues.

&gt;The Prince replied to thank the Secretary of State for her help.

Many important trials in this country are conducted before a jury. There's an important reason for that. Juries may not be experts in the law, but most ordinary people have some understanding of how juries work, and trust the jury process. We think of juries as being like us.

On the other hand, a trio of corporate lawyers, many of whom regularly rotate between being advocate for big companies and judges on corporate cases, overruling democratically elect governments according to arcane points of law. That's not something people trust. So how can we trust that such corporate courts will always, or even regularly, make the right decision? And right for whom?

&gt; So let me ask you a question, do you think the government should have the power to stop any company at any point it chooses to stop using their branding on their product packaging?

Governments are subject to regular checks and balances. The exact nature of these checks and balances depends on the country, but in many western countries they include regular elections in which governments have to justify their decisions before the electorate. 

As far as I'm aware, there's nothing in our current law to stop a government from forcing fruit juice manufacturers to remove their branding, but it simply doesn't happen, and similar things don't happen, because politicians know they will lose votes.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Office**

&gt;At the time of writing Armagh Gaol, one of Northern Ireland’s most important historic buildings, had been vacant for 20 years. In the correspondence His Royal Highness offered the help and expertise of his charities to find a new and practical solution to help save the site.

&gt;Alongside the Trevor Osborne Group and Armagh City Council the Prince’s Regeneration Trust PRT played a part in the successful regeneration of Armagh Gaol.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Prime Minister**

&gt;His Royal Highness corresponded with the Prime Minister on issues of particular concern including supporting hill farmers, bovine tuberculosis (TB), procuring British produce including British beef and challenges for the dairy sector.

&gt;The correspondence about bovine TB centres on the rising number of TB cases in cattle and the cost to the taxpayer. It also refers to a study of the impact of badger culling in the Republic of Ireland, which showed the efficacy of culling in reducing badger infection. For the dairy sector, most farmers were making no profit on the production of milk and some were making considerable losses.

&gt;The letters deal with the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, and help that could be provided to farmers who were struggling to cope with the new business processes.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Minister for Environment**

&gt;The Prince of Wales had raised concerns about the plight of the albatross for some time. One of the main reasons for their decline was thought to be due to Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing.

&gt;The Prince of Wales wrote to the then Fisheries Minister, following a letter about the work of the High Seas Task Force (HSTF). The HSTF emerged in 2003 from the Round Table on Sustainable Development. This committee of ministerial representatives from a small group of countries was formed to address the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas, a practice which was adversely affecting albatross numbers.

&gt;**Prince of Wales correspondence with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry**

&gt;The former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wrote to The Prince of Wales to say that she had met with the charity In Kind Direct (founded by The Prince of Wales in 1996) to hear about the charity’s work.

&gt;Patricia Hewitt said she is unable to help with any funding for In Kind Direct. She also said she has tried to assist by introducing them to various other public sector bodies or to other government colleagues.

&gt;The Prince replied to thank the Secretary of State for her help.

&gt; We briefly mentioned the European Union Directive on Herbal Medicines, which is having such a deleterious effect on the complementary medicine sector in this country by effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts. I think we both agreed this was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. You rightly asked me what could be done about it and I am asking the Chief Executive of my Foundation for Integrated Health to provide a more detailed briefing which I hope to be able to send shortly so that your advisers can look at it. Meanwhile, I have given Martin Hurst a note suggesting someone he could talk to who runs the Herbal Practitioners' Association.

Tony Blair:

&gt; Thanks too for your contacts on herbal medicines - who have been sensible and constructive. They feel that the directive itself is sound and the UK regulators excellent, but are absolutely correct in saying that the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy. We can do quite a lot here: we will delay implementation for all existing products to 2011; we will take more of the implementation upon ourselves; and I think we can sort out the problems in the technical committee - where my European experts have some very good ideas. We will be consulting with your contacts and others on the best way to do this - we simply cannot have burdensome regulation here.

The Lib Dems lost badly, and then there were the people voting UKIP (third party in Wales), Plaid increased vote share by 1%... I think it could have been a result of former Labour votes going elsewhere, rather than a massive massive resurgence in Conservative support. My mother who had previously voted Labour like, every single time, voted Plaid this time. 

Labour has also been the Welsh Assembly government for a while and if you follow Welsh politics you might remember some scandals regarding NHS quality, educational standards, and essentially pissing millions of euros on projects which actually helped nobody, so maybe that hurt them in some regards.

Your mortgage payment would be £455 per month (roughly) and your rent would be £536 per month (roughly). So £991 per month for a property you only own 1/3 of.

I am not sure how much bills run per month in Brighton, but I suspect another £50 at least on those two items. All in all, your housing will cost you £1166 per month. I don't know if you'd be able to get a mortgage for a property like that in light of the cost of rent.

I've been hypothesising various reasons as to why he's still around for a couple of seasons at least. My favourite being that he's really Emenalo's secret lovechild.

The fact is that a lot of these decisions aren't purely on a footballing basis. Mikel won't sell for that much in reality so it really would be easier to not renew his contract, equally that's making a massive loss on someone we bought off united (technically) at a very young age which would probably be a disappointment to a lot of people. Particularly given his attacking potential at the time. So financially it's a bit of a no profit and no loss atm, keeping the asset being better than selling it at what you deem to be undervalue, especially given his price.

However, I think the main reason, is simply that he's well liked. Mikel is a very affable chap really, everyone seems to like him in the squad. He's never a divisive figure and his position happens to be one where we've lacked proper quality for a while. He's also been a decent age really for a long time. And as far as coaches go, he gets on well with pretty much all of them, because as always he's nice and does what he's told (even if not particularly well or many things are being asked of him).

The main thing it boils down to football wise for me is that he's not intelligent enough defensively and is very deliberately limited in an attack because of his defensive liabilities in returning to position or even appearing to be bothered enough to get back. Let alone make a well timed challenge rather than a cynical one. And don't get me started on his range of passing or vision, or even his stats because frankly he's terrible with the ball, he consistently passes to our players already being pressed and will force us to lose the ball when instead he could take more time with it.

Finally, this isn't just my concern, practically everyone thinks Mikel is pretty crap. And ok Chelsea fans are fairly biased to the affable nice bloke who smiles a lot. But even Nigerians and British-Nigerians think it's frankly ridiculous he's still in our squad, in as much as he's regularly ridiculed/laughed at if he gets on the pitch. Similarly, many Man U fans think they dodged a bullet with him.

The AV would have been far superior, since the 'splinter' votes get funnelled back into more popular parties, so people actually get more of a qualitative say on who they want running the country.

But when it comes to mortgage products--banks have two key separate categories: Buy-to-Lets and Primary Residence. The former is 5x more risky than the latter. As a result, the lending criteria is completely different. Primary residence mortgages do not permit letting, subletting, etc. The only way you can let is with permission from the bank. However, even if you get permission to let out a room, you will need to pass affordability checks as if you are the sole occupier. If your after tax take-home is £1,561 and your housing costs are £1,383...that's quite a thin sub-£200 spread. What happens if something needs to be repaired? Don't forget you need to eat! What I am suggesting is that the bank might not even be happy to lend on this basis. 

Edit: One more point I forgot. Its unlikely the housing association will permit letting out a room, as well, unless you are staircased to 100% ownership.

How does that happen?

In previous elections it was explained that the ""it'll looking doubtful for Candidate X in Constituency Y"" type rumours an hour before the declaration was due to fairly obvious clues - the ballet papers being sorted into bundles per candidate, then it's easy to see who's got the largest pile before the formal count.

But in this election there were a couple of ""Candidate X has probably lost"" very early on.  Ed Balls being an obvious example, they announced this on the BBC coverage at about 10.30p.m., the official result (although there had been recounts of course) didn't come through until 8a.m. the following morning.  In the Balls example, there was even the famous quote ""the ballot boxes haven't even arrived yet"".

Well, the obvious thing about a postal vote is that one person could cast lots of them much more easily than in person. However, they'd still need to get lots of postal votes that they could fill out with a valid-looking signature.

Buying votes, for example, would be much easier with postal votes. In a properly executed secret ballot, the people who want to buy the votes can't check who you actually voted for. With postal votes, they could just buy signed forms where the vote hasn't been cast yet, and then fill that bit out themselves.

You could also imagine them signing up real people at a false address, or signing up apathetic voters (using a signature the fraudster can do), and then intercepting the votes in some way (a bent postman or something).

Interestingly, I stopped signing things properly years ago. If someone asks me to, I just do a squiggle. It's a terrible form of security anyway.

Batshuayi had a massive growth/jump in being a talent to looking like a top talent (Same as Origi).  Batshuayi is more of a Lukaku player than a fancy dribbler.
Martial had a similar big jump and is now the new Thierry Henry.  We all know how stupid those comparisons are, but it gives fans a way to talk about and hype a player.

My question is how is Sinclair/Ojo/other academy guys compared to Martial, Rolan, and Batshuayi.  Out of those 3, Martial is most likely above the others due to his CL experience.

Really enjoyed riding it as a commuter, good grip to the road, decent brakes, not to heavy, fitted the rear mud guard and panniers with no orobs. Front mud guard requires an extra long bolt for some reason due to the fork depth. 

It would also qualify you for the bike to work scheme.

Whilst I agree with your point, I think there are a lot of unelected people that influence government policy other than just the royal family. At least they don't use money to lobby politicians, and they have no real influence other than giving their opinion, which the prime minister can simply ignore.

Personally, I think there are a lot of other things that hinder our democracy much more than Charles' talks with the PM. At least Charles seems to be on our side.

If you receive a packet of drugs in the post, then you probably asked for them - like, easily more than 50% likely.  And based on that (and any rules they have about drug use), the university can expel you.

In criminal cases, the standard of proof is ""guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"".  It is not enough that a preponderance of evidence leads a court to find that someone *probably* committed the offence; there must be so much evidence that any alibi offered by the defence is judged to be so unlikely that to believe it would be unreasonable.  But again, ""guilty beyond reasonable doubt"" doesn't mean that any other explanation must be impossible; only that it must be unreasonable to believe it.  If someone comes into court and goes ""Someone has pranked me, I have no way to demonstrate it, they have no motive, and I won't tell you who it was"", the court is unlikely to see that as the introduction of reasonable doubt.

null,false,FMN2014,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeen,null,"&gt;Prince Charles, a lifelong supporter of complementary medicines (he set up his Foundation for Integrated Health in 1993 to promote their use), was very exercised by an EU Directive in 2004 which aimed to stop the unrestricted sale of herbal medicines, some of which had been shown to cause harm.

&gt;He lobbied Health Secretary John Reid about it, but appears to have got little joy. Prime Minister Tony Blair, however, was far more sympathetic. A letter of 24 February mentions a meeting at which the Prince raised the EU Directive on Herbal Medicines.

&gt;&gt; *Which is having such a deleterious effect on the complementary medicine sector in this country by effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal* 

**He is promoting homoeopathic medicines, that's not good.**
&gt;In perhaps one of his most niche requests, the Prince of Wales leans on environment minister Elliot Morley to tackle illegal fishing of the Patagonian toothfish - favoured prey of the albatross.
&gt;&gt;*I particularly hope that the illegal fishing of the Patagonian Toothfish will be high on your list of priorities because until that trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old Albatross.*

**So he is concerned with illegal  fishing and ecosystems, that's good.**

&gt; Prince Charles writes to Jowell asking her to bend the rules over providing overseas funding to restore huts used by Scott and Shackleton in the Antarctic.
&gt;&gt;*I am at a loss to understand how this restoration project can be correctly described as “overseas”? Whatever the case, and however futile my plea to you for a bit of imaginative flexibility in the interpretation of these rules, I just want to emphasize the iconic importance of these huts in those great Antarctic journeys*

**He wants to preserve historical buildings, that's good.**

&gt;The Prince of Wales writes to former culture secretary Tessa Jowell to lobby for the protection of buildings at Smithfield Market, which were set for demolition.
&gt;&gt; *As you know, I attach the greatest importance to preserving, restoring and re-using such precious heritage townscapes and I can only pray that the deputy prime minister will take your advice and give the most careful consideration to development plans.*

**Again he wants to preserve an old building, that's good.**

&gt; Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s head of environment, has this analysis on Charles’s interventions over the environment and farming.
&gt;&gt;*I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary. I, for one. cannot understand how the “badger lobby” seem not to mind at all about the slaughter of thousands of expensive cattle, and yet object to a managed cull of an overpopulation of badgers - to me, this is intellectually dishonest.*
Supporting the badger cull, that's not so good.  

&gt; Prince Charles wrote to John Reid regarding the redevelopment of Cherry Knowle Hospital in Sunderland, on which the Prince’s Foundation charity worked.
&gt;&gt;*I have hesitated to bother you too much on this issue, and on the wider one of the disposal of one hundred NHS hospital sites, but I feel now is the time to return to the fray!*

**He is consider with progress of the redevelopment of a hospital, that's good.**

&gt; Prince Charles expresses strong concern over difficulties faced by the military in Iraq, particularly resources and the poor performance of Lynx helicopters
&gt;&gt;*The aim of the Ministry of Defence and the Air Army Corps to deploy this equipment globally is, however, being frustrated by the poor performance of the existing Lynx aircraft in high temperatures.
Despite this, the procurement of a new aircraft to replace the Lynx is subject to further delays and uncertainty due to significant pressure on the defence budget.
I fear this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.*

**He is consider about the armed forces and the equipment they have, that's good.**

I don't see anything taboo here, other than the cull and homoeopathic medicine.

null,false,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,null,"Red Sky had a contract to maintain all the housing executive houses in Northern Ireland. It's a feckin huge contract worth circa 7million every year.

Problem was, Red Sky were shite at their jobs. Rumour has it they rarely turned up and when they did, they did a substandard job. There were loads of complaints about them and there were allegations of triple invoices for the same job, invoices for jobs that had not been completed and lots of corrupt shit. The Housing Executive did an investigation and decided to terminate the contract.

Red Sky remember is based in East Belfast, at the time Robbos constituency. Loads of people employed from the East work at Red Sky and rumour has it (although I can't confirm this), the management donate to the DUP war chest.

The Housing Executive decide to terminate the contract, Red Sky go into administration because their only client is the Housing Executive and there's a big fuss. Red Sky were going to reform and call themselves something different to maintain the contract but, hey ho, the Housing Executive decide to keep them on until a better maintenance firm is found.

Jenny Palmer, DUP councillor who sits on the Housing Executive was going to vote in favour of terminating the contract because Red Sky are shit and allegedly crooks. She gets a call from now McCaulsands SPAD Steven Brimstone saying (and I'm paraphrasing) ""Vote to keep Red Sky. You vote with the party, the party says keep Red Sky and don't vote against it.""

During this, Nelson meets with a window company which installs windows in Housing Executive houses. It's in his diary as meeting with this company. A few days later, he tells his civil service secretary to change the meeting details to a meeting with the cross business ""Glass federation."" Again, the company he was meeting with are allegedly DUP donors.

The DUP apply loads of pressure on the Housing Executive to keep Red Sky. Robbo accused the Housing Executive of being sectarian against prods in East Belfast. The chairman of the Housing Executive resigns (He said his position was impossible and nothing can be done). The DSD committee do an investigation, everytime a DUP witness is called to the committee, Jim Allister tries to do what he does best, interrogate, but Sammy and Gregory throw a strop and the witnesses get off scot free. When Brimstone turned up, all he said was ""Internal party procedures"" and got away with it.

Brimstone has now been promoted to serve as Robbos SPAD because Herman Munster was elected to Westminster for East Belfast.

TL:DR - Red Sky based in the DUP heartland of East Belfast and alleged DUP donors had a 7million contract to maintain Housing Executive houses. They didn't. Jenny Palmer was told by DUP to vote with party and blew the whistle on DUP practices of putting the party before the country.

The only defence I've ever seen a scientist muster about the effects of leaving the EU on UK science funding is that we'd be allowed to keep getting ERC grants and Marie Curie fellows, which I think is somewhat delusional. They aren't going to let us quit paying for everything in the EU that benefits another country more than us, and keep all the bits where we end up better off.


edit: One other thing is that I wonder if the damage isn't already done for a couple of years to the Marie Curie fellowships. We get a lot of these, possibly partly due to the fact that the researcher gets to pick the University much more so than the other way around. They're also not allowed to work in their native country. Everyone who gets awarded one of these speaks fluent English, which I imagine tips the scales a bit as to which foreign countries they'd like to live in, even aside from our surfeit of world-class research institutions.

Pales into insignificance compared to the savings on monthly mortgage repayments for buying outside of Brighton. 10 miles from Brighton, £160,000 with a monthly mortgage repayment of around £500 if you used the £40k as a deposit sees you buying a 2/3 bed house/bungalow with full ownership.

In particular they challenged the statistics showing GDP would increase as a result;

&gt;That resistance, particularly in Europe, has grown slowly but steadily since TTIP was announced on 17 June 2013, at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. President Obama said: ""the U.S.-EU relationship is the largest in the world. It makes up nearly half of global GDP. We trade about $1 trillion in goods and services each year. We invest nearly $4 trillion in each other’s economies. And all that supports around 13 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."" The host of the meeting, Prime Minister David Cameron, called it ""a landmark deal between the European Union and the United States of America—a deal that could add as much as a £100 billion to the EU economy, £80 billion to the U.S. economy, and as much as £85 billion to the rest of the world.""

&gt;Those are figures that have been heard many times since, when discussing TTIP and its benefits. They come from a study produced in 2013 by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) on behalf of the European Commission. What David Cameron failed to mention was that the figures refer to what is called the ""ambitious comprehensive"" scenario - in other words, pretty much the best case, which assumes that all tariffs are removed, and 25% of the costs associated with non-tariff barriers also disappear.

After all, he's already got himself a nice new £6.5k Rolex this week, what more does he need??

But the idea of him being at the core of a team that brings as much excitement to Irish football as the 90s did would be incredible. And in the long run for him, you would think much more satisfying than being a bit part player in an under-achieving England side.

When you hear other English born players like McAteer talking about the sort of reception they used to get in Ireland when they were qualifying for major tournaments, I don't think English fans realise the level of adulation they get.

I guess it's a big decision as imagine he stays with Villa his whole career (which I don't think will happen unless we really up our game over the next few years), and opts for Ireland then there's a risk he could end up looking back on a career with no trophies and no appearances at a World Cup or Euros, whereas I'm sure he'd back himself to be worthy of both of those things.

Let me repeat, Barca are a very very good team and easily one of the top 4 but a defeat tomorrow to Real will not be earth shattering by any means. They may be the form team at the moment but that can change when up against closely matched opponents.

You cannot possibly think that Pep is overachieving by making Bayern reach the semis. A top 4 team is _expected_ to make the final 4. Sure, Bayern has injuries but their injury stricken side is still a hell of a lot better than most other sides. And its not like Bayern had tricky opponents along the way to the semis. Shaktar and Porto. The other semifinalists had atleast one tricky draw.

If this is exceptional, then you'd need to come up with a whole new term for Juventus being in the semis. Or Atletico making the finals last year.

To take another deviation and address the point you just made, though, I guess the four possible counter arguments are that 1) /u/Liability42 just reminded us that the IRA blew up large buildings, killed hundreds of people and disrupted everyday life.  Society might not have faced full-scale collapse but surely those are things we want to stop from happening again?  Which leads on to 2) Perhaps (of course...) the situation in the 1970s and 80s wasn't handled was well as it could have been, should we not seek improvements this time around?  3) There were a huge number of breaches of human rights by the UK government back then too - people were denied a fair trial, locked up in inhuman conditions, shot without valid justification.  There's a point to be made that in general people have MORE rights these days.  4) These apparent new breaches of rights are being introduced because of the changing face of technology and communication in this day and age.

But rather than accept the court's ruling, or appeal further (finding whatever grounds), the Government simply ignored the tribunal's position and used their executive veto. Which led to the second set of litigation ending in the Supreme Court.

The question was a big constitutional one - not ""should these letters be published"" but ""should the Government be able to ignore the ruling of a court just because they came to a different conclusion on the same facts and same law?"" And the Supreme Court said ""no."" Although even then it was a majority decision.

Can we please stop this 'include all the non-voters in the percentage' idea please? If the non-voters were strongly against a Tory government they would have been motivated to go out and vote. By not voting they either don't care enough who is in power (in which case they don't care the Tories won) or they hate all parties (in which case they don't like the Tories but would have felt the same way whatever happened). You never include non-participators in the final stats because we have no way of knowing what they would do if forced to vote, I suspect if forced into voting they'd vote more or less in a similar proportion to what the election results ended up being. It is slightly more relevant in a strike scenario because if you don't vote then that would suggest you don't have strong feelings towards striking, and so should be counted as a small (definitely not a whole) vote for 'no'.

In any case your point is flawed either way, there's only 2 options in a strike vote, there's 6 or 7 per constituency in the election.

Working in a small business I see the other side to policy that isn't just fairness and making everybody shit rainbows. Believe it or not Labour policies put a stranglehold on small businesses and make entrepreneurs life far more difficult than it should be - through constant regulations regarding 'equality' that sounds fantastic on paper but in reality is easily abused by employers and employees alike.

I believe to solve the issues regarding poverty in our country we need to invest in our own infrastructure instead of spending more and more on welfare. By employing everybody able to work and increasing the average wage we make the country better for everyone - not just the rich, and not just the poor.

What riled me up in the first place is the ridiculously paranoid attitude everyone on here has towards the Tories.

Time: Telephone medical consultations don't save time, Skype medical consultations wouldn't save time and email consultations wouldn't save time. All it would do would be to take up more time that could be used seeing patients face to face.

Regulation: where they are used telephone consultations still need to be arranged with the doctor. There wouldn't be the facility to do this properly with emails and the risk is the doctors are left dealing with piles of trivial correspondence which would be very hard to timetable and plan for in comparison with telephone consultations.

Good medical practice: Any medical advice a named and identifiable doctor gives much comply with GMC standards of good medical practice and can potentially be the subject of a lawsuit.
This means that it would be medico-legally risky to dash off a quick response to an email without due consideration of all the implications (hence the doctor doesn't save any time). Furthermore even telephone consultations rob you of the ability to examine a patient and pick up on non verbal communication during the consultation. Email takes it a step further and stops you being able to consider even the patients tone of voice. Good medicine depends on good observation, and this is best accomplished in a face to face consultation.
This is the reason good medical advice on reddit begins and ends with the sentence ""See your GP"".

Information governance- Emails within a trust email system are reasonable secure. Emails between a nhs email account and a patient's email are not secure but would still be subject to data protection legislation and information governance requirements. It's asking for trouble. Also NHS IT is shite.

Yes it would be more convenient. However convenience comes second to Information governance, good medical practice and resource management. The first two can be worked around.

Ther thing is there are lots of people, like me, who have Republican leanings. I'm not going to march in the streets for the monarchy to be removed, but if it came to a vote, I'd probably vote to remove them as an institution. The reason I tolerate the idea of monarchy is because they have a stated policy of impartiality and non interventionism in matters of politics. The fact that Charles pays little regard to this policy is worrying to me.

Watching an admittedly limited amount of him for Belgium you can see that Divock not only has all of the physical tools to succeed (he's got close to the perfect build for a striker IMO) but also a good sense of positioning. He's good at creating space for himself to either get off a shot or a pass and he shows a good sense for making runs off the ball, either into the box or out wide into space. He's not the finished product technically but that's the kind of stuff that you can teach. Admittedly, it remains to be seen whether he's a natural goal scorer or more of a winger hybrid.

Why not? I would have thought that it should.

&gt;But the letters are being written to individuals rather than departments,

What does that mean? What's the difference between writing to the person in charge of an organization with regards to that organizations activities and writing to the organization itself?

&gt;I mean, I have no more power than the prince, and yet any letters that reveal my position on a subject written to any individual of parliament, I would be aghast if they were made public.

Formally you don't, but he does have a level of privilege and access with which could be seen as inappropriate for him to be trying to influence Government matters. There is an expectation of neutrality. Writing secret letters to the Government about Government policy raises questions about that. The position of the monarchy is as mired in convention as any other constitutional matter. It would be fine if he resigned from his position as heir - then there wouldn't be as much justification for publishing even if he was heir at the time of sending.

If he's going to be King, he can't be seen to be writing secret letters to the Government about its intentions. We might expect to at least know what they are about.

These are not personal letters.

He does not go into details of his personal life. There have been invasions into his private life in the past. This is not one of those times.

&gt;My title is Mr Bob Bobberton. Does the fact I wrote it using my own letterhead, my own title used for decades, make it ok to publish?

I think you know that I don't mean that anything with an official mark of its sender is okay to publish. If Mr Bob Bobberton is not literally the heir to the throne, it's not relevant to what I'm saying.

I suspect it was organised through the EU because it's far easier to work through existing channels than to build new ones. Why set up a new body to co-ordinate science funding when you can ease the process by doing it through the EU?

&gt; You're saying that you believe striking workers have the right to cause personal devastation and huge financial loss as some sort of bargaining chip?

yes. this is hyperbole anyway. 1) airline staff don't go on strike often in this country 2) did the Icelandic volcano breach our human rights when it erupted and closed airspace? 3) events such as strikes and other circumstances are covered in the T&amp;Cs when buying a ticket and also accounted for in EU261 regulations. 4) you're making dramatic stories in some attempt to give your story credence, not every traveller is on leave from the army or going to a funeral, and not every traveller leaves everything to the last second. 


strikes generally don't just happen out of nowhere. they're the extreme end usually coming after a long series of negotiations. it's up the airline to get you to your destination, not the employee. if the airline can't negotiate with its employees it isn't always the fault of the employees. instead of blaming the individuals why not also look elsewhere?

your idea is obviously ridiculous. asking customers if workers can strike? so when the fire brigade want to strike do we ask all the people in their area if that's ok with them, or the people who we think might have a fire planned on that day?

nobody wants to go on strike. losing a day's pay is a lot of money for a lot of people. but why on earth would a customer not want to veto a strike? i might support the idea of an airline's staff striking, but i don't want them to do it on the day i travel.  

obviously you're just deliberately being a cunt. comparing a strike to terrorism. when royal mail went on strike for a day, it is clearly pathetic and makes you look an absolute arsehole when you compare a day delay getting your bank statement in the post to somebody blowing up a train and killing people.",null,0,null,1431541939,null,0,false,0,cr80bgl,null,t3_35qmit,null,t1_cr80bgl,null,t1_cr7zp98,null,null,null,1433044116,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I know what you're saying, but I'm not sure there's a big distinction. Labour survives only for as long as there are members willing to support it (in terms of time, money, and intellectual energy). People will only do that while the party and its leadership is doing things that they agree with. One way of looking at it is that Labour should do what its supporters say, or they'll leave. Another way of looking at it is that Labour needs to have a platform that is attractive to its supporters, or they'll leave. They both amount to the same thing.

Just look at the Lib Dems. They attracted millions of voters, donors and activists with a distinctly left-of-centre pitch. They thought that they could do what they like to that platform and the voters and activists would stick with them- they didn't. Now they've lost 80% of their MPs.

If the Parliamentary Labour Party had a free hand to choose anyone they want, they might pick the same person as the party at large would have chosen anyway (in which case, what's the fuss).

null,false,itonlytakes1,null,null,null,"I can only speak for my part of the country, but I see no evidence that removing people buying to rent would have any effect on the price of housing. I see lots of competition for housing that is suitable for letting (generally the lower to middle parts of the market) but even then, landlords are generally buying the bargains that are below market value.

Also, landlords generally don't buy at the higher end of the market (not really high but 4-5 bed detached), some do but this isn't the norm. Removing landlords would have little if any effect on demand.

Your argument is sound for a supply / demand situation, but housing is too complexed with too many variables to be able to apply it reliably. It has a habit of doing its own thing. For example, during the last crash, a number of landlords went bankrupt due to falling prices, yet others made huge profits as rents increased (demand for rental increased as people weren't able to get mortgages) and interest rates fell. This should have had a further impact on prices, either increasing as landlords took advantage of cheaper prices and higher rents, or decreasing as struggling landlords sold off their less profitable property. In reality, it didn't seem to make any difference. I firmly believe that the two main influences on property prices are overall supply (both owned and rented) and interest rates. It's no coincidence that property prices rocketed when rates fell in the early to mid 2000's.

Overall I think demand / supply can be applied to house prices with regard to the whole market, but it fails if you try and apply it to segments of the market.

One thing you have touched on that is a huge problem is the incentive to build. Large builders own huge amounts of land that they aren't building on yet. If builders could be coerced, bribed or forced into building that would help a lot.

Edit: I forgot to add, if you remove landlords then the amount of property to rent reduces, those people still have to live somewhere. Assuming they could buy, all this does in increase the number of potential buyers, overall demand is largely unchanged. If this isn't the case you can see my response elsewhere in this thread about why removing landlords is a bad idea.",null,0,null,1431542608,null,0,1431542823,0,cr80rfs,null,t3_35t50y,null,t1_cr80rfs,null,t1_cr7zlre,null,null,null,1433044326,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

C2 June 2012

1) Chromatography - why is there a lid on the container when doing paper chromatography?  
answer: To prevent the solvent evaporating or support the paper.  

2. Advantages of gas chromatography compared to paper chromatography.  
Most are ok with this but remember:  
Gas chromatography is faster,  
more accurate and  
more sensitive (can detect very small quantities or you need a small sample)  

3. Explaining why a higher temperature increases the rate of a reaction.  
Please be careful with this!  
Answer: particles gain more energy or move fastER  

**COMMON MISTAKE: PARTICLES VIBRATE MORE (THEY DON'T VIBRATE IN A LIQUID) OR MOVE MORE**  
**Correct answer: They are more likely to collide or they collide more often or more frequently**    


**COMMON MISTAKE: THERE ARE MORE COLLISIONS**  
**Correct answer: There are more successful collisions or more particles have activation energy.**    

4. When calculating relative formula mass make sure you watch out for the small numbers  
Al2O3 means there are 2 aluminium and 3 oxygen atoms.  

5. Extraction of Aluminium - aluminium oxide is mixed with cryolite. What is cryolite for? Only a few knew this:  
Answer: to reduce the melting point and so reduce the need for energy.  

**COMMON MISTAKE: CRYOLITE IS A CATALYST**

What happens to the positive carbon electrode in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide?  
Answer: Electrode is made of carbon or graphite and it reacts with oxygen  
to make carbon dioxide  

6. What are nanoparticles?  
size is 1 - 100 nm  
or particles which are made of a few hundred atoms or ions  
or particles with a high surface area to volume ratio.  

7. Why is graphite softer than diamond  

Graphite: the layers of carbon can move or slide over each other.  
because there are weak forces or weak intermolecular forces between the layers  

Diamond: Each carbon atom has a strong bond or is covalently bonded to 4 others (which makes a three dimensional structure.  
Carbon atoms cannot move or slide  

Final point. Remember graphite is a good conductor because the electrons can carry charge THROUGH THE STRUCTURE  ",null,0,null,1431542632,null,0,1431543436,0,cr80rzz,null,t3_35usd0,null,t1_cr80rzz,null,t3_35usd0,null,null,null,1433044332,null,6,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,6,null

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"Research councils do already do that, and it's good that we also have a separate national system for doing that. But the major reason is that small contributions from across Europe pool together to make a large fund which can direct money to member states which consistently outperform other member states so that the best quality of research possible is produced all across Europe.

It also means that the overall science budget of the EU can be quite large in comparison to any one member state, so more of the important science that needs to get done can be done. The EU is probably as good at the British research councils at doing what it's doing, but here's the thing - it has way more money and allocates that money to the countries producing the best science (very often us!).

I should point out that my perspective here is 'we need to do all of the science and it doesn't really matter if it's done in Germany or the UK as long as it gets done' - but as a biomedical scientist I would much rather it be done in the UK with generous levels of funding. ;)

Research absolutely can and should be done using all of the examples you stated. I just think it should also be done through the EU project. That's because the EU has commitments to research in areas that will benefit Europe as a whole - climate science, cancer research (as an aside there's an absolutely MASSIVE pan-European long-term cancer/diet/other stuff study going on atm, should be pretty good), research into fisheries health, agricultural practises, social policy... We also benefit from inter-EU exchanges, access to fellowships and research posts and in other things that aren't directly money-related.

I like those things. I like European co-operation and integration. I don't mind that we put more money in than we get out - we're pretty rich, we can afford it.

Single person 3% raise at 65 would be about 39k, 70 would be 46 (so current standard retirement age for me would be closer to 67/68 so somewhere between the two, maybe 43?). 

1M at 67 which was invested *pre tax* would be worth a payout of 250k tax free, then 28k/year after tax rising at 3% for life, plus state pension. That's about the best I can work out anyway, I'd be appreciative if anyone who's more familiar with this stuff chimed in.

By the way, this is also with annuities which cost you money for a guaranteed payout. You could potentially withdraw significantly more while the remainder hopefully grows. 

You can also invest 15k/year post-tax which you don't pay capital gains on, and then also invest outside of that without paying capital gains as long as you don't gain more than 10k per year.

So you can invest 1M before tax and pay tax on the income, invest (between 25 and 65 with a 3% after inflation growth) another 1.2M, take a growth of 10k/year after that tax free, and any growth in your primary residence is untaxed if you downsize. Potentially, someone could have ~1.5M tax free + house growth + 28k/year with guaranteed growth + state pension + another 10k/year gains *before* you have to pay tax.

I'm a small business owner myself and nothing the Tories have done has helped us. Their business policies are tailored towards larger businesses - the tax cuts only kick in when your profit is above a certain threshold which we do't meet at the moment. Green policy is all about helping smaller, local business rather than larger corporations. I much prefer that model.

I agree we should spend less on welfare - but the Tories are going about it the wrong way. They're just trying to get as many people off it - regardless of the cost or consequences, or even the lives lost or ruined. The minimum wage is not a living wage - meaning people have to claim benefits while they work in order to simply survive. This means that the taxpayer is subsidising businesses who are getting cheap labour. The Green party advocate a citizens wage, which is a lot simpler and cheaper to implement and doesn't cause any of these problems.

I think we have every reason to be paranoid. It's not unheard of that a seemingly innocuous political party gains control and then starts implementing policies that do severe harm to its citizens.

You mention Hitler, but let's not forget that even the Nazi party won a popular vote - they didn't force themselves in.

I know nothing about them, apart from that they took all the money and laughed. I don't know what kind of life they have at home or what debt they owe or whatever. They just appear to be 'normal' and so then must be not needy?

It may sound bad, but there were no directions on the sign saying take only what you need, and they could have been laughing just because they got free money, not laughing because they ripped someone off for the money.

Please forgive me if I've misunderstood, or haven't picked up on something or misread something. It just seems a little bit odd to me that everyone is annoyed with these two people for taking the money, even though the sign offered money to (needy) people. You may not take the money yourself (whether you'd be embarrassed, too proud, believe there are people worse off than you who may deserve it more, couldn't be bothered with the hassle for a small amount etc) but it doesn't necessarily mean others won't.

But I guess if someone objects in principle to us being a net contributor then we would never agree on the issue. What do other net contributors say about this issue, I wonder? (I should probably read up on it.)

Would the UK government have given the money the Welsh Assembly has received through EU funding to Wales without the EU? Would the UK government fund research into climate change? The effects of climate change on Britain's endemic freshwater invertebrates? Would the UK government fund numerous post-graduate research students all across Wales whilst at the same time fostering partnerships between academia and businesses in  the most deprived areas of Wales? The EU has similar benefits to other parts of the EU, spending money ('British money') on the most deprived parts of Britain, parts that consistently fail to see any major investment or intervention by successive UK governments. Without that money I can think of several very personal things that wouldn't have been there for me.

2. the science labs at my college
3. my undergraduate research project

It's easier to head off the requests for additional power when the government is relatively benign and quite possibly genuinely well-meaning. It becomes significantly harder when some charismatic psychopath takes charge and decides to use the accumulated architecture of surveillance and secret police and secret courts for less benign purposes.

If I were in a particularly charitable sort of mood I might *just about* be persuaded to trust the likes of David Cameron and Teresa May to limit their use of ""anti-terror"" powers to *just* dealing with genuinely dangerous individuals. At least until I remembered that we've already seen other anti-terror surveillance powers (ab)used for everything from checking up on whether some kids *really* live in the school catchment area their parents claim, to monitoring dog owners' poop-scooping habits.

He never had any, and even admits himself that he is ignorant on many things.  But, it's pretty damn evident he's not stupid. Your generalisation of the definition of stupid is the only stupid thing here. Francis Crick believed life on Earth originated from a gait intergalactic sperm, is he stupid? Tesla passionately believed in eugenics, is he stupid? Isaac Newton believed the bible was a code that predicts the future and that the Babylonians already know the laws of physics and he was just rediscovering them, he also believed he was a messiah sent from God to reveal these truths, is he stupid?  We don't all have time to look for the evidence of everything, I believe for example that Islam preachers in Africa believe that condoms are a conspiracy from America to inject the aids virus into them, yet I have no proof for that and can't tell you if it's true, but I believe it because Christopher Hitchens told me in his book, who i consider to be an authority on the matter. Maybe if Charles was presented with the evidence, he would change his mind, we can't know, but I think it would be very wrong to just call him stupid, which sounds like more of a subjective attack from yourself and not an objective one.

&gt; Prove it, or shut the fuck up and realise you're out of your depth and have no place in a scientific discussion.

Yea, that's not how science works at all. Scientists discuss constantly about theoretical subjects, mathematics and theoretical physics for one, that they can't in anyway back up or prove. And I'm not defending homoeopathy, I'm just correcting you. If you think the scientific community solely works on the basis of ""Prove it or get the fuck out"", then clearly you know nothing about the scientific community. A lot of scientists will approach the scientific community with a hypothesis in the hopes scientists will help them solve or they admit they can't prove it, but continue to apply logic and knowledge to the idea. Philosophy is piratically dedicated to the study of logic and using argument to back up ideas.

I also said research into fisheries and agricultural practise, not *creating* policy. It does do that but that isn't what I was talking about.

In fact I've said nothing about EU policy decisions re: fisheries and agriculture (some of which are quite concerning - but which absolutely aren't the issue here, which is science funding). The EU funds major research into aquaculture and the health of ocean fish stocks and biodiversity. This is really important because there are a number of halibut fish farms in Europe but none of them are actually profitable because we don't know how to farm the fish effectively yet.

Because it's still profitable to fish wild fisheries nobody is really committed to investing in aquaculture research, but to continue fishing them is bad and will result in ecosystem collapses. If we want to keep eating fish we will need to farm them. That's the sort of thing I meant, not setting policy on fishing. The EU funds a lot of important research that 'nobody cares about' that wouldn't get funded otherwise, not because it isn't good science or because it isn't going to be useful but because it can't be monetised by private interests and isn't exciting enough for national governments.

You're right, in the short term if would keep happening, and the child would be taken into the care system. And the care system is not a good place to be. However, do i genuinely think that a properly run care system has a better chance of producing a productive, respectful and well balanced member of society than these scumbags? Yes. I do. In essence then yes, the child suffers, but it suffers less than it would having absolutely zero life chances in the hands of these feckless wankers. 

There would need to be considerable funding put into bring the care system up to a decent standard, but in the long term once people realized that this shit was no joke, they'd start falling into line, in the main, particularly if contraception was a requirement of continued benefits claims. There would need to be developed an effective male contraceptive first however. 

My other concern about solutions like youth clubs and community centers is even if they could work, who the fuck are you actually going to get to staff them? Maybe a few leftie do gooders from up the road who can indoctrinate them in their ""Yuman rights"" and teach them to be attack helicopter kin and hate their cis friends, but they sure as shit aren't going to get any truly positive role models.

You're quite right, it's really because he's a royal. The money and influence are there beacuse of that.

&gt; the monarchy are 'supposed' to be politically neutral.

Only the Queen has to remain politically neutral, as she is the head of state. The rest of the monarchy are required to remain so, but only so they do no embarrass the Queen. Many members of the royal family are able to vote and stand for MP, the Duke of Edinburgh being the highest ranking royal to be able to.

Either way, being politically neutral shouldn't mean they cannot talk about policies or raise them with those MP's in power. There's nothing wrong with being concerned how the country is run, if anything, they should be very concerned with how it is run as long as they respect the democratic process and do not take political sides.

&gt;

&gt;Among political observers, Farron is widely seen as being of [left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_wing)-leaning political position.     In a 13 May 2015 interview on BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme, he said that the centre of British politics was ""where we need to be"". 

&gt;In December 2010, he voted very strongly against increasing the cap on university tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000.  Referring to Nick Clegg's earlier pledge not to raise fees - and the previous long-standing Liberal Democrat policy of abolishing them - he said: ""Integrity is important. You must not only keep your word but be seen to keep your word. You can say no.""   He has voted in favour of allowing marriage between two people of same sex, and against replacing Trident with a new nuclear weapons system.

What they'll do is ask you to fill in a permission form with a bunch of details like former addresses and contact details for companies you've worked for and if they can contact them. They'll then ignore what you've said about permission and fraudulently misuse your signature in sending questionnaires to all past employers (if it's anything like my experience).

For the 3 month gap you need to provide two professionals as references to confirm an out of work period, they can just be friends. If you do put down that 2 month job they will contact them to ask about your timekeeping, your honesty, your pay while there and your reason for leaving. They will compare that to the information you provide TSW and put it all together in a big report and give it to your new employer (large professional services company, perhaps?)

Voting for strikes has to be done by postal ballots. Ballots get lost in the post, people lost their ballot, they forget, they can't be arsed even. 

But in most situations, since strikes aren't the Battle of Orgreave all over again, most workers stay out even if they didn't vote. My wife's done that several times. Some people cross the picket lines and generally most people don't care. Not my bag but some people need the money and can't afford the unpaid day if it's a one day strike.

The whole point of strikes is that the business loses out, and as such allows the workers to inflict meaningful financial damage on their employer.

Strikes are covered under EU261, or in the event of train travel the atoc ticketing rules (although there will often be bus services). If you are likely to suffer consequential loss you should insure for it.

On a more general point, I can't remember (in the 15+ years I've been paying attention) a public sector strike that was solely related to pay increases. Except where the proposal is to freeze or offer only token rises (i.e. protesting a pay cut).

To play the opponent was something Moyes did for years as well. I wonder if his restrictive approach was a result of the glass ceiling he felt hindered him from competing outright with the 'big 4' or the other way around. 

Following Mourinhos first term Chelsea was not as successful without him there to run things, it is a team composed to play a very particular branch of football that is not something I expect anyone will be able to keep up should he leave. Same can be said about Manchester United when Ferguson left, he was unique in his ability to build and manage a squad of players. 

Every team can learn from watching Mourinhos Chelsea, but they shouldn't attempt to imitate them and expect the same success. 

Let's appreciate Mourinho for what he adds to the league.

&gt; Thanks for your kind email, I really appreciate it. I’m really delighted to have been re-elected, I had my first day back in Parliament yesterday! I’ve looked into this and I know that communications data is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised crime prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. These days more and more time is spent online, and the ability of law enforcement to access this data is declining rapidly and dangerously so it’s essential that we do something about it. I believe that as far as possible there should be no safe spaces for terrorists to communicate and this is something that we are working towards. Our manifesto made it very clear that a Conservative government will introduce the legislation needed to restore our declining communications data capability. We will also use all the legal powers available to us to make sure that where appropriate the police and security and intelligence agencies have the maximum ability to intercept all communications of suspects, whilst still making sure that all intrusive measures are properly overseen as I do think it’s important that we strike the right balance here. I’m really proud that the Government has strengthened the oversight of the intelligence agencies, and how sensitive powers are used. I think that this was an important step in the right direction. The Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of the intelligence and security agencies, has been strengthened to make it independent of government and to have the power to require information from the agencies. A new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board has also been set up, and the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation has been asked to look at the legislation governing the use of communications data and interception.The Conservatives are determined to draw a line under this debate by legislating early in this Parliament to give the police and security and intelligence agencies, clearly and transparently, the powers they need, and to ensure that the oversight regime keeps pace with technological change and addresses the reasonable concerns of the public. As we are reminded time and again by terrorists, this is not an abstract debate but a very real question of how we can give ourselves the best chance of preventing attacks and saving lives.I want to be clear here that these powers will only be used in extreme circumstances and will have to be approved by an independent board and senior officers. It won’t be the case that security agencies will just be monitoring everyday phone calls and internet use and if it were then I certainly wouldn’t be voting for it! Thanks again for your email on such an important topic. If you’d like to discuss this further then just let me know as I’d be happy to.&gt;

Re IP - joint ownership always *sounds* great on paper, reality is it is often a real pain. It depends on the circumstances, but I almost always end up advising clients not to go down that route. Other options like licences/royalties usually end up being better in the long run. Also, I have seen many, many contracts attempting to agree ownership of IP fail spectacularly - if it is important to you it is worth getting it right!

Jordon Ibe is set to sign a five-year contract with Liverpool next week.
The club reached an agreement in principle with the 19-year-old and his advisers this week and the winger has only the formalities to complete on a deal that will run until 2020.

Ibe is regarded as one of the club’s outstanding prospects by Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, and his development this season has been rewarded with an increase in his weekly salary from £6,000 to £30,000.
Ibe made a big impact this season while on loan to Derby County in the Sky Bet Championship, with five goals in 20 league appearances.

Rodgers gave him his first Barclays Premier League start in the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park in February after using him as a substitute in the 2-0 wins over Aston Villa and West Ham United.",null,0,null,1431551302,null,0,false,0,cr86jsg,null,t3_35vg0z,null,t1_cr86jsg,null,t1_cr86j06,null,null,null,1433047121,null,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12,null

The first is testing for a carbonate; you just add dilute hydrochloric acid and the gas that's formed you add into limewater, if it turns cloudy then carbon dioxide is produce so there is the presence of a carbonate. The way I remember this is that you are trying to find carbon dioxide and **carbon** is part of testing for a **carbon**ate  
  
The second test is testing for halides where you add dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate to the solution and the precipitate that forms is either white (for chloride), cream (bromide) and yellow (iodide). I would remember this by alphabetical order for both halide and precipitate colour, so **C**ream precipitate would be a **B**romide, a **W**hite precipitate would be **C**hloride and a **Y**ellow precipitate would be **I**odide. So **CWY** matches up with **BCI**  
  
The last test is testing for a sulfate, this is adding dilute hydrochloric acid and then barium chloride solution and if a white precipitate is formed then it's a sulfate.

Deflecting your cowards way?

&gt;Let me repeat, Barca are a very very good team and easily one of the top 4 but a defeat tomorrow to Real will not be earth shattering by any means. They may be the form team at the moment but that can change when up against closely matched opponents.

Who said it would be earth shattering? I didn't say Barcelona was untouchable. Just they are the best all around team. 

&gt;&gt; Are you high? He has done an exceptional job.

&gt;You cannot possibly think that Pep is overachieving by making Bayern reach the semis. A top 4 team is _expected_ to make the final 4. Sure, Bayern has injuries but their injury stricken side is still a hell of a lot better than most other sides. And its not like Bayern had tricky opponents along the way to the semis. Shaktar and Porto. The other semifinalists had atleast one tricky draw.

Never said he was over achieving. Just not underachieving. He is doing everything a manager of his calibre should do. He has been nothing but exceptional as a manager there. As he should be. 

&gt;If this is exceptional, then you'd need to come up with a whole new term for Juventus being in the semis. Or Atletico making the finals last year. You might as well congratulate Pellegrini on making top 4, Klopp for avoiding relegation. 

Juventus is an exceptional team as well. The amount of talent they have is amazing. Why does Pep get look down upon if he Doesn't win the CL but wins everything else? That's just unreasonable. You have put him on a pedestal no manager can live up too. You have put Bayern on a pedestal they will never live up too. Teams just don't win the treble every season.

null,false,MrMashedPotato,null,null,null,"&gt; I have a feeling this has been their strategy all along. Make the city centre near undrivable for cars

That is the other side of the coin - DRD have very specifically designed the [Belfast On the Move plan](http://www.drdni.gov.uk/botm_updated_final_leaflet.pdf) for pedestrians, public transport and cyclists - not motorists. The infrastructure around the city centre is ongoing to divert motorists out of the city centre.

_""This will be focused on improved public transport services, better facilities for walking and cycling and a reduction in the dominance of travel by private car.""_

The recent resurfacing works, improved junctions and re-designation of some routes (IE: south belfast resurfacing, Millfield exchange, proposal for York Street and GVS/Hope Street to Westlink) only goes to reinforce the main point of the plan: motorists should not drive through the city centre. 

The business of fining motorists has a deterring effect (undeniable really) but I doubt that it's the main thrust of the on-the-move plan.

&gt; All a money making scam by the sounds of it.

Hardly. Congestion in the city centre was terrible before the plan was implemented, and will not get any better as car ownership increases. The roads can only become so wide, and sustain so much. The alternative is get out of your car, and walk/cycle/use public transport, when it comes to the city centre.",null,0,null,1431553325,null,0,1431555430,0,cr87sy6,null,t3_35u6ug,null,t1_cr87sy6,null,t1_cr7uxks,null,null,null,1433047712,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

Issue with joint ownership is often it restricts both parties rather than gives them rights. For exmaple with copyright (usual IP right that protects software) if there are joint owners neither can use the work *themselves* without the permission of the other. If the two of you fall out you could potentially stop each other from using the software you created. If one of you wants to licence someone else to use the copyright, you can't unless the other agress as well.

I recently used it again at night to help my skin repairing its moisture barrier after it became super irritated from avobenzone and alcohol in sunscreens I was testing the previous 3 weeks (apparently, my skin is highly sensitive to avobenzone).

You can layer other skincare products with Rx. Rx ideally goes first, then the rest can follow. Unless, it's Retin-A cream which can go last after you let the other products soak in, around 1 hour before bed. Using something before Rx is fine, it just may buffer it, but not necessarily reducing the efficacy.

My skin is also dehydrated and I'm considering to get a hydrating lotion or serum to layer under SebaMed Clear Face Care Gel. It's just not hydrating enough for me. I'm currently testing **Aldi Biocura Aqua Complete Multi-Intensif Serum** (I got it in NL, hence the name). I'm thinking to try next:

* **Clinique Moisture Surge Face Spray Thirsty Skin Relief**
* **Yamano Kohaku-Hada Lotion, Moist Type**

Dear Mr Davis,

Firstly let me congratulate you and the conservatives on getting into Westminster. On Thursday I was proud to say I voted for a conservative government, however by Friday evening I was regretting this decision. The reason for this regret was the Draft Communication Bill or 'Snoopers Charter' I believe this to be an invasion of the basic privacy of myself and the rest of the UK population. I voted for conservative because I am soon to be married, soon to buy a house and hopefully to start a family and believed the conservative to be the best government for the future, however if this bill passes I may turn to another party. I am not a member of your constituency unfortunately, however I have heard you are opposed to the bill and would therefore like to thank you for this opposition and wish you the best of luck in fighting it.

Your sincerely,
Craggsy

null,false,andreww631,null,null,null,"Oh ffs not this Eriksen lack of assists nosense again.

This is frankly a nonsense stat. Eriksen has created the 5th most chances in the league. Last season he had 8 assists. His lack of assists is just a statistical freak and is due to poor finishing from his own teamates. Theres a statistic that tracks the quality of chances created called expected assists and Eriksen still ranks very highly on that: https://twitter.com/SteMc74/status/576363371349581824/photo/1

In fact hes among the elite creators in Europe (red dot is last season purple one this). Add in the fact that Eriksen is one of the best goalscoring midfielders in the league and is a good presser, its clear we have a special player. Why there is this weird anti-Eriksen sentiment beginning to spread is completely bizzare.

An example to point out how poorly windy is using this stat is Gareth Bale. IN the 11/12 season he had 10 assists, in 12/13 season he had 4 assists and then the 13/14 season he had 12 assists. The season in which he has the highest chance creation rate was the 12/13 season where he had the least assists! The assist stat is often very misleading.

Theres literally nothing to see here with the stat windy posted. What particularly irks me is that I can help feel that /u/windycoys is being somewhat agenda driven with his anlysis here. IIRC he was quit anti-Eriksen when we first signed him.... Hopefully windy can respond and give his side though

Edit: decided to search on twitter and found this tweet around when he was first rumored to be joining https://twitter.com/WindyCOYS/status/371225654416527360

Either one would split the party and alienate some part of the electorate. I think Cooper is a creditable MP and has a lot of experience, but I don't think she's strong in front of the cameras and I don't feel confident in her as a leader. And like Burnham she's rather tainted by association with previous Labour administrations. Liz Kendall is a bit of an unknown. In the few interviews I've seen of her she comes across as inexperienced. But she clearly has ambition and I think she has the right ""big tent"" sensibility - setting out her stall in the Sunday Times would seem to be something of a statement of intent.

The status of the royal family is pretty bizarre, and I don't think there is really anything analogous in the US.  Over the last several centuries, we have gradually transitioned from a system in which the monarch wields the vast majority of political power to one in which Parliament does.  There are still lots of important powers nominally held by the monarch, and some by the prince of Wales, but in practice the government tells them how to wield them.  So, for example, certain kinds of bills have to receive the blessing of the queen and/or the prince of Wales before they can be introduced (this is called ""Queen's Consent"" or ""Prince's Consent""), and all bills have to be approved by the queen before they become law (this is called ""Royal Assent""), but for several decades these powers have been used in accordance with the government's wishes.

If the royal family used any of these powers against the government's advice nowadays it would likely lead to a constitutional crisis.  However, they could try and gain leverage over the government by threatening to do so.  There is even a precedent for this: George V threatened to veto the Government of Ireland Act 1914, but quickly backed down.  The fact that there are so many secret meetings and letters between the government and the royal family means that we don't really know for sure how much influence they have behind the scenes (though, to be fair, the same could be said of various prominent business and media figures and major political donors).

Another issue is the influence the royal family have in other areas of society due to their status.  In the last few years, there have been [several corruption scandals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York#Controversies) surrounding Prince Andrew, and of course, unlike an elected politician, there is no way to get rid of him.  There have also been several allegations (though not quite so severe) about Prince Charles inappropriately using his influence - for example, [Edzard Ernst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzard_Ernst), a medical researcher and prominent critic of alternative medicine, blames Charles (a big fan of alternative medicine) for being forced out of his job.

A big reason why they lost in Scotland was aligning themselves up with the Tories 'Better together' campaign rather than distinguishing themselves with a 'No' vote of their own. Appealing to the Tories with distinctive Labour polices is not impossible. 

In 97' Blair ran with policies such as the renationalisation of the railways, the halting of NHS internal markets(which he actually accelerated when in power) and putting workers in boardrooms. We ended up with none of these. 

Elections shouldn't just be about winning, the Tories right now know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Labour needs to address this rather than just offer a Tory-lite alternative.

Labour need a safe pair of hands now more than ever, you can see the party dividing itself already, fucking Mandelson came out and said Labour could survive without the unions. 

The Tories may well attack Burnham for PFIs but they were first brought in by the Tories, so there is blame to go round. Umunna would lose so many tradional voters and members(myself included) its unreal.

He may well win middle England, but Scotland would be forever lost and it would be Labour basically conceding further ground to the Tories, they're wrong and instead of playing catch up to try and convince their voters we'll be just as good as them we should be convincing them we're better than them in different ways. 

I don't think anyone in the leadership is going to do that though, so for me it's about securing Labour's base and waiting for people to feel the effect of a 5 year Tory government with a slim majority.

They can't. There are very very few circumstances a bankruptcy can be overturned and they pretty much all are based on it being issued in error.

&gt; Plus it's only £3000

No it isn't. It is all monies that were outstanding on the date and time the order was made. All loans, unpaid phone bills etc, everything. When you are made bankrupt all you own and all your financial affairs up to that point become the property and responsibility of the official receiver. The problem is that if the OP has since paid anything off debts that were around before the order was made then that is seen as preferential treatment of a creditor which is illegal under bankruptcy law. It doesn't matter about any debts accrued after then but it does up until that point. Also if the OP has applied for credit over £250 and not informed the lender they're an undischarged bankrupt, again that's an offence. 

However overall its a good thing. A bankruptcy at least draws a line in the sand and allows you to move on with your life.",null,0,null,1431557240,null,0,1431558512,0,cr8a3ap,null,t3_35v8ei,null,t1_cr8a3ap,null,t1_cr86j20,null,null,null,1433048860,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

You're making the mistake that many do and assuming the monthly mortgage payments are the only outgoing with owning your own place. Total cost of ownership of a property isn't usually that much less than renting as all the things that a landlord is required to repair are now your expense and as I've found out with the house I currently am in, over the last 5 years its cost me more than renting with the repairs that have been done and will have to be done in the future.

null,false,Ivebeenfurthereven,null,null,null,"&gt;Approaching signal SN43, there was an Automatic Warning System (AWS) magnet in the trackbed, warning of a temporary speed restriction ahead.The normal line speed was 125 miles per hour, but a temporary restriction of 85 miles per hour was in place. This did not apply to the train as steam locomotives are restricted to a maximum of 75 miles per hour on Network Rail (NR) tracks. An automatic brake application was made on the train after it had passed over the magnet because the driver did not acknowledge the warning given within 2.7 seconds. The driver should have allowed the train to come to a halt and contacted the signalman, but he did not. **He cancelled the warning after the train's speed had been reduced from 59 miles per hour to about 51 miles per hour. This action had the effect of rendering the AWS and Train Protection &amp; Warning System(TPWS) unable to apply the brakes on the train.** The train passed signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. The driver acknowledged the AWS warning, but did not reduce speed.

&gt;Signal SN45 was displaying a red (danger) aspect. By the time the driver realised this, there was insufficient distance available to stop the train.

Aha. I had trouble understanding the driver's motivation, now I suddenly understand. 

The driver only overrode the steam engine's modern safety equipment because he (correctly?) thought it was just overreacting to a speed limit which he was not exceeding. This then had the knock-on effect of leaving the system totally unable to react to the yellow and red signals beyond it, and so the train overshot. 

To be fair, that's a valid engineering problem with how the automatic safety equipment works. A first unrelated incident (false alarm for a speed limit) shouldn't lead to the total loss of emergency automatic braking subsequent to that. Yes, he shouldn't have even *needed* emergency automatic braking - but humans make mistakes, that's why the system saves lives, so it shouldn't be that easy to accidentally turn it off permanently when you were trying to deal with an unrelated alert.

&gt;Before he was relieved from driving duties, the driver of the charter train claimed that signal SN43 was displaying a green (proceed) aspect. NR investigations showed that a single yellow (caution) aspect was displayed.

No sympathy with this though. Any railway professional must know how close to disaster his own actions brought hundreds of people - at that point, why even lie? There's too much far more important than your own job prospects at stake. The moral thing to do is surely be honest, assist the investigation

I really don't want a Labour party that just settles for the lesser of two evils but I can see your point and that's sort of what I'm doing backing Burnham. 

The party needs to be going in the right direction though, a return to new Labour would divide the party at a time we should be uniting against an ever dividing Conservative party.

 Blairism's authoritarian slant is one of the worst aspects of Labour today, a socially liberal Labour would be more welcoming to young voters, instead we had Ed Miliband arguing with teenagers about why marijuana is bad and then Labour attacking the Lib Dems for being 'soft on drugs.' Labour can't be seen to attack social injustice and defend draconian drug laws simultaneously. 

I've been shaken by the election too, but surrendering your views because they don't match society is how Labour got into the state its in. When the law banning homosexuality was repealed it was one of the most unpopular moves of its time, but it was the right thing to do. 

What's popular now in 5 years time will be very different indeed. So Labour need to above all figure out what they stand for and stand for it, Miliband wasn't too left or too right, he was too indecisive. 

When he was elected leader he proclaimed ""I'm a socialist."" A week before the election he was telling One-Nation Conservatives ""I'll be your champion."" That's too broad a church even for the Labour party.

 I've went into full rambling mode but if Labour's going to win they need a new direction without the gimmicks, to ignore Old Labour would be as harmful as ignoring New Labour, the successes and failures of both need to be looked at and learned from, not used as a blueprint of how to win again.

3. At the next general election, the incumbent Speaker has to be reconfirmed in his/her role by a vote amongst the new MPs. Quite what would be fair, i.e. simple majority, 2/3 etc. I'm not sure yet.

null,false,Moinmoiner,,Labour Member,null,"Hiya there Kingy, welcome to the party! 

I'll try my best not to insert my own bias in my descriptions, but broadly I think there are three main camps within the Labour movement at the moment:

1). Old Labour - People who who occupy the left-wing of the party and wish to take the movement back to its socialist roots. They're advocates of strong trade union powers (and their traditional links to the party), a strong government hand in the economy (often linked in with nationalisation of some key industries, e.g. electricity and the railways), high taxes for the rich and a strong social safety net. These were basically the main points advocated by Labour politicians up until 1994, and they still enjoy a lot of support among the party faithful, but advocating for them too-strongly is often viewed as making the party unelectable. 

2). New Labour (or the Blairites) - In 1994 Tony Blair took leadership of the party and felt that the party needed to broaden its appeal outside of its working-class heartlands by appealing to 'Middle England'. He did this by scrapping some of the more left-wing positions of the party (e.g. nationalisation and high-taxes), courting big-business, and accepting the laissez-faire system of capitalism Thatcher had brought about in the '80s. Labour won three majorities on the back of this ideology and much-needed investment was given to schools and hospitals, however many regard New Labour as having betrayed the party's traditional principles; income inequality continued to rise, many former-industrial towns did not get the investment they needed and a lack of regulation of the banks is widely seen as causing the 2008 banking-crisis. Some people, citing our electoral success during the 2000s, view this as the direction the party should head in order to win in 2020, but much of the party views it as needlessly selling-out. 

3). Blue Labour - This one's quite new. It views New Labour as having betrayed a lot of its working-class support in backing neo-liberal economics and being too-light on immigration and welfare-abuse, seeing the erosion of our traditionally-solid working-class base by UKIP in key marginals as one of the reasons we lost the election. On the one hand they want to take the party more to the left (higher taxes for the rich, more market regulation, less privatisation etc.), but on the other want to take it to the right by being more tough on crime, the long-term unemployed and immigration.

The Labour Party's a very broad church and a lot of people hold views from multiple camps, or ones that I haven't discussed here at all, but I hope this gives you a very brief overview of what the views of the main groups are at the moment.

null,false,Sambri,null,null,null,"Most international projects (non-EU) are usually based on a single problem (build a telescope/space station/research centre). There are very few programs that promote collaborations between different groups internationally.

This happens for one main reason: any country wants to attract scientists from other countries, so you don't want to collaborate with them, you want them to come to you. (Actually, most scientists wouldn't care, but they require funding).

The EU doesn't care whether a researcher is in Germany or in the UK, so the EU can support groups to collaborate and share their knowledge/expertise. This would be impossible if Germany and the UK were competing for attracting each other scientists...

As an example, my group has established many links with groups around Europe where some students spend some time learning a specific technique in another country and then they come back (and they send someone over here). The EU is probably the only one funding such agreements (through Initial Training Networks). This still happens with other groups outside the EU, but it's up to the group to find money and, as I said, the government doesn't like funding people to come here for a while.

Yes, McGinn was on big wages at Celtic.  Doesn't mean that is why he took a cut in wages to come to Aberdeen.  He himself said it, it was to play.

The player on loan is on the same wages, it's true.  So why go on loan when you can earn that by doing very little?  Because it's about job satisfaction.  It's about game time.  It's about playing.

Earning three times my salary may be upping my standard of living.  Only if it means doing something I enjoy.  Otherwise, it's making me worse because I'm miserable all the time.  Trust me, I know.  I've worked jobs where I've got smashed every night because I hate work.  How's that increasing my quality of life?

I don't really think there's anything wrong with him saying that whatsoever, if he's going to sign a 5 year contract he needs reassurances that the club is going to be moving forward and competing on the highest level - something we haven't done for an incredibly long time now. By the time he's out of the contract he's going to be 25 which is pretty much half of his career over. 

But the point still stands really, do you really think Sterling thinks he can get £150k at a club? His agent's reasoning for demanding £150k is pretty logical imo, Gerrard and Sturridge are both on around that and Sterling has been on their level over the last 18 months so why shouldn't Sterling be on similar wages. So it makes sense, but not in the sense that those players haven't really had the impact of £150k/week players over the last 18 months but you can definitely understand his agent on that one.

&gt;EDIT - I'm glad to see the club take this hard line stance in years gone by we wouldn't have. Rival clubs knew that and took advantage of it.

I don't know, this could result in having a bunch of players who clearly don't believe in the club's future &amp; don't want to be here, do we really want those types of players around? I'm not so sure.

What do you mean by this? I was saying McGinn had earned his money at celtic, was now financially secure and was in a much different position than Jack is now due to his years of earning huge money.

&gt;Asking him to turn down life changing money and financial security is a bit too much. You don't need to be obsessed with money to move jobs from an employer you love, to a new one who is offering you 3 times your previous wages

&gt;In my opinion, moving jobs because you were offered triple your current salary is a very reasonable decision, one that a huge number of people would make, from any career group.

&gt;Well McGinn had been at celtic for years, earning that big money. He was already financially secure because of it. Jack has not.

Wonderful. We should cultivate areas of deprivation - areas which have long-term impacts on the physical and mental health of people born and raised there, areas where not only is there material poverty but poverty of aspiration - just to get more money from the EU?

The problems in Wales are as bad as they are because historically - prior to the EU and its projects - nothing was done about them. That wasn't to attract EU cash. It was just because nothing was done.

There is a point to be made about how much the EU distorts member state spending, but it's not like Wales was a massive centre of investment historically is it? The problems have been getting worse over time.

I'm also not really interested necessarily in being a net recipient or breaking even because part of the point of the EU is that richer countries can help poorer countries. It's part of the point, and it's one of the reasons I support the EU. I like many parts of the project. The 'we don't get as much money as we put in' argument doesn't bother me because I don't mind if the EU doesn't benefit me more than anyone else, part of why I like it is that it helps other people in other places.

I don't want to be part of the EU because I want to e.g. help the state of Romania. I don't mind being a net contributor if that means the people of Romania see an increase in living standards and overall personal wealth, though. I like the people aspect of the EU.

And I've participated in and benefited from a number of different EU projects.

You touch on poverty of aspiration, as an effect experienced by individuals who have come to depend on subsidy, but the same effect can easily occur when governments do the same.

As to helping Romania, I'm not sure that sending in money and pulling out anyone with any work ethic or brains is the way forward for them.

Now, don't get me wrong. I don't have any problem with him saying that during his negotiations and seeking those reassurances while those talks are happening. I have a huge problem with him going on tv without the clubs permission to say it.  Considering the club finished second the year before and were still in the hunt for champions league it was unnecessary and disruptive. 

His own form has gone down noticeably since it happened too. Regarding the point does he think he can get 150k at a club. Possibly, yes. Does that mean he should get it at his age with Liverpool? No. I don't, he's been on par with a declining captain who's performed year in year out for almost 15 years who was on 120k and a captain elect who's agreed to 100k a week. 

He didn't just turn down the deal, he went public in a thinly veiled come and get me plee. 

I fail to see how a club fighting tooth and nail to keep their best players would make anyone doubt the clubs future. If anything I'd say the club just accepting it and letting a rival hoover up their top young talent has far more serious implications for club moral. 

There's a fair offer on the table on par with the clubs top players who have played longer than him, it's not like he's being lo balled. If he doesn't want to accept it, fine. But that doesn't mean we have to either. I like this stance because it will mean if he goes it's on our terms. if he stays he'll consider the very real possibility of two years on 35k and think, I may as well sign and ask for a transfer down the line. 

Doesn't mean he'll stay if he did sign a new deal but the club are very rightly putting themselves in the driving seat in any possible way they can.

I think you are misunderstanding so I will try to be more clear.

The big difference between his contract at Aberdeen and his contract at celtic will be his wages. And not just slightly different. Hugely different. His play time may or may not differ, that is not known. What is known soildly is the huge, life changing increase in his salary.

You think he will be a bench warmer, he will be miserable and so would only move on if he is obsessed with money.

I think for such an enormous guaranteed increase, him agreeing to move even if it means taking the risk of not playing is a rational, understandable, typical thing to do. Especially when as a young professional footballer he will have confidence in his own abilities, confidence enough to make that a risk well worth taking.

I keep coming back to the money, because it is certain. Your playing time response is much more speculative, grasping at the possibility that maybe he will fail.

Tom Carroll could play a 3 yard square ball to Bale and earn an assist when it ends up in the top corner from 30 yards away, but Bale could run the entire length of the pitch and get fuck all when his inch-perfect cross gets cunted into the parking lot by Adebayor. 

When a player has high assists it's usually pretty safe to say he's creative, but the opposite isn't necessarily true. Context is needed, and things like key passes are more telling stats.

Swansea's rise has been a sustainable one that is seeing the club become a stable, ever-present force in the Premier League.

While it isn't as sexy as a former legend signing with us or enticing a big name prospect to come on loan, doing things like investing in the stadium and youth set up is the way to maintaining our success. Wales has provided world class talent in Ramsey, Bale, Giggs, Rush etc. in each of the recent generations. If Swansea can start to keep some of these players in Wales rather than having them poached by other top clubs, the team would find even more success. 

Monk has put a much stronger focus on youth and that is what has me optimistic. Other than Davies I never felt there was a promising youth player at Swansea under Laudrup and even Davies would have remained nameless without Taylor's injury. Now players such as Grimes, Barrow, Fulton, King, Gorre etc. make it feel like we have a real future with this club.

&gt;However, if he just wants to play, it's entirely possible he would opt to stay at the Dons because he'll be making less money but he's guaranteed to be playing just about every game rather than being sat on the bench.

&gt;  And there's such a thing as job satisfaction. The majority of people would turn down the triple your salary offer if they are happy where they are or know that they might not be as happy in the new job.
And for footballers, that means regular football. How many players have admitted handing in transfer requests in the hope of first team football? How many go on loan so they can play regularly? Hell, Niall McGinn told Craig Brown he wasn't bothered how much Aberdeen could afford to pay him, as long as he was starting games.
And that's the bit you're missing from the scenario you've presented. It's not just about the money

 &gt;Yes, McGinn was on big wages at Celtic. Doesn't mean that is why he took a cut in wages to come to Aberdeen. He himself said it, it was to play.
The player on loan is on the same wages, it's true. So why go on loan when you can earn that by doing very little? Because it's about job satisfaction. It's about game time. It's about playing.
Earning three times my salary may be upping my standard of living. Only if it means doing something I enjoy. Otherwise, it's making me worse because I'm miserable all the time. Trust me, I know. I've worked jobs where I've got smashed every night because I hate work. How's that increasing my quality of life?
Finally, you said it yourself. At Celtic, he's not guaranteed to be a bench warmer. At Aberdeen it's a certainty he's not. All the confidence in the world means nothing if the boss doesn't pick you.

&gt;You can have all the cash you want, if you're not happy with your life it makes no difference.

His defensive work rate is actually not that bad, he can improve on tackling etc but that should come with time and experience. Inter is playing with a similar formation as we did when we did have both Sturridge and Suarez playing. One defensive midfielder in Gary Medel and two players who goes offensively in Kovacic and Guarin. 

But overall i would say he is better having someone more defensively next to him. A midfield of Kovacic, Henderson and Allen could work against teams we know we are going to control the midfield. But we are going to need a midfielder who is positionally strong and can protect the back four, basically a Lucas who is not injured half the season. 

Can is not a DM, but rather box-to-box. I think having him next to Henderson with a DM behind them could be really dam scary. The problem with Emre Can is his general football knowledge, where he should stand on the field as he got all the intangibles to be a fantastic footballer, he just needs more experience.

null,false,Peli-cant,null,null,null,"Jonjo has improved a lot this season.  He has flashes of greatness and has been really exciting to watch.  I hope he continues his form for our final two matches. 

However, and not to undermine a good post, I still believe that the club should accept a bid in the 8m-10m range, should it be presented to us and here's why. 

I think that we can agree that while Jonjo is young and talented, he often disrupts possession and he is defensively weak.  These could very well be maturity issues, but in a possession based system that requires our midfielders to defend, Jonjo causes problems.  This season he has had a pass completion ratio of 78.9%, which according to Whoscored.com is 19th-best within the squad, and worse than all of our center midfielders.  He also averages 4 inaccurate long balls and 6.3 inaccurate short passes (admittedly Cork commits 6.5) a game.  He leads our center midfield (excluding Gylfi, who's a #10 anyway) in unsuccessful touches, giving the ball away in this category 1.1 times per game.  Now, defensively, he records 1.3 tackles a game (which is actually comparable to Ki).  He also only intercepts 1.3 passes per game, while committing 1.1 fouls per game, worse than any of our center midfielders.  He gets .9 clearances per game, which is low, and records less blocks than any other midfielder.  In summary, Jonjo is a talented, but sloppy player, and I'm not sure that he is the midfielder that we need.  

I think that if we could get a 10m fee for Jonjo, which may be slightly unrealistic, that it would make sense to sell.  We could buy a solid center midfielder for 3-6m who could rotate with Ki or Grimes and we'd have surplus to spend on other positions.  I like Jonjo a lot, but I think that this would make sense.

Sorry for hijacking your post.  I agree with you, but I don't think that Jonjo's direct play style always fits the club's.
