1. many impatient people pirate music because they can wait up to 6 days until a song/album is released in their country.
2. albums often leak much earlier than the music in many countries because the album is released in other countries days earlier, this will reduce the number of days that albums leak before release day.
3. many people are paid on fridays
4. easier and cheaper to advertise 1 release date and less confusing
5. countries will record 7 days worth of sales for the opening week sales, america currently only records the first 6 days.
6. there is higher levels of social media engagement on fri-sun so much publicity will be generated for new music.
7. less manufacturing and distribution employees will need to work at weekends in order to get cd's in to shops in u.k on mon and u.s on tue. This will also reduce cost as many weekend workers get paid more than weekday workers.

&gt; **Blepharoplasty** NHS East Riding of Yorkshire CCG do not routinely commission Blepharoplasty. Refer to Ophthalmology for opinion only where there is functionally significant impairment of vision.

&gt; Funding will only be considered where there are exceptional clinical circumstances. The clinician needs to submit an application to the Individual Funding Request Panel.

If it doesn't fit the criteria for Blepharoplasty, it could fall under the general cosmetic surgery guide:

&gt; Cosmetic surgical procedures for the correction of changes associated with age, pregnancy, weight or because of unhappiness with body image are of low priority. These will not be routinely commissioned from or performed by secondary / tertiary services in Plastic Surgery, Dermatology, General Surgery, Ophthalmology or any other specialty or primary care based Minor Surgery Services, unless exceptional clinical need can be demonstrated and prior approval given by the IFR.
&gt; 
&gt; A patient may be considered to be exceptional to the general policy if BOTH the following apply:
&gt; 
* He / she is different to the general population of patients who would normally be refused the healthcare intervention
* There are good grounds to believe that the patient is likely to gain significantly more benefit from the intervention than might be expected for the average patient with that particular condition
&gt; 
&gt; Only evidence of clinical need will be considered.  Factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, lifestyle or other social factors such as employment or parenthood will not be considered.


Skimming through the rest of the policy, you have a long shot with mental health (specifically ""evidence of substantial psychological distress"", but only really if you have a psychological / psychiatric opinion from secondary care (i.e. not just your GP).

The first thing you need to do though is to actually have your vision checked.  Go to an optometrist and have a sight test.  If the optometrist thinks your vision has any obstruction ask them to send a GOS18 to your GP.

**Do note that their policy is due for an update in July 2015, so watch out, it could change any time.**

null,false,harryman100,null,null,null,"There's a few key differences between owning a 'second-hand' house and a newbuild.

Quality:
Older houses tend to be built to a higher quality, but will have suffered more wear and tear over the years. Expect to have to do some work on them.
New builds often have a lot of 'snagging' (because no-one else has ever lived in it, expect to have to find ALL the problems yourself).
Speak to most builders and you'll also hear horror stories about the frames still being wet when they finish the house, a problem which isn't likely to show for many years, but could be serious.

Appearance:
Most newbuild houses will look very sharp, crisp, clean and tidy, but after 3-6 years of being lived in they will look just like most of the houses you've looked at second hand. Most people will decorate after moving in and make a house look good again.

Location:
I know more people who dislike newbuild estates than like them as they lack character. However, look at the location in more detail, quite a lot of newbuilding is happening on flood plains (they're putting in defenses, but would you trust that?) 
Newbuild estates often won't have very good access to schools, shops and other amenities as well, where as established housing has been accomodated for already.

Building work:
A lot of newbuild estates are still being built, so you may have to deal with construction traffic for years after you buy.

Size:
You mention the ones that you've looked at are comparable size, however, in general room sizes are smaller in new build houses (it may be that you're in an area where old houses tended to have small rooms as well - this varies based on location.

In summary - it's all about personal taste - you mention you moved recently to the UK - we have a culture here which prefers reusing housing rather than building new, and this means that houses don't depreciate like other assets. The idea of wanting your house to have 'character' is quite a British concept.",null,0,null,1436560618,null,0,false,0,csyzuso,null,t3_3ctj5m,null,t1_csyzuso,null,t3_3ctj5m,null,null,null,1437751747,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Some more quotes from the document, linked above:
The right of access to information is also essential for accountability and good
governance; secrecy is a breeding ground for corruption, abuse of power and
mismanagement 19 . No government can now seriously deny that the public has a
right of access to information, or those fundamental principles of democracy and
accountability demand that public bodies operate in a transparent fashion 20 .
...
The reasons most commonly stated in relation to giving access to court files are
enhancing efficiency, effectiveness, public confidence in the judicial system, and
fair administration of justice (including the public's perception of the judiciary and
judicial decision-making) 73 . In addition to promoting public confidence in the
judiciary, allowing the public to access judicial proceedings and records
encourages judges to act fairly, consistently and impartially, allowing the public to
“judge the judge” 74 . “To work effectively, it is important that society's [...]
process satisfy the appearance of justice [...] and the appearance of justice can
best be provided by allowing people to observe it” 75 .

4.1.3. Canada
In Canada, the right of the public to open courts is an important constitutional
rule 144 . The right of an individual to privacy is a fundamental value as well.
However, the right to open courts generally outweighs the right to privacy. 145 As
a result, in Canada all court files are accessible to the public under the existing
presumption that all court records are available to the public at the courthouse. If
technically feasible, the public shall also be entitled to remote access to court
files.",null,0,null,1436560978,null,0,false,0,csz03ar,null,t3_3atnnx,null,t1_csz03ar,null,t1_csyzhlp,null,null,null,1437751880,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

I'm guessing this might be a first bike purchase, and I'd assume that you're going for a 125 because you're on L plates. Is there anything stopping you from getting your A2 and buying something you can grow into, rather than having something you're going to want to sell on? In the second hand biking world £2500-3100 can get you some awesome bikes. Say you spent £800 getting your A2 (at the higher end of the scale) you could still get a great 600 that you could cherish and love until the restrictors came off.

If necessary, keep asking until they give you a sufficient answer. Also, ask what childcare facilities the university has and ask if they're available to students - I'm not sure how likely this is, but you may be able to find a university with a good, affordable nursery that you can enroll your son in when your partner wants to go back to work.

You may also want to consider looking at doing a part time course, so you can keep working while you study if you still need the money.

As a side note, I'd also recommend checking with the the Students' Union to see what campaigns and work they're doing and the support they offer for low-income students, student parents, and mature students. If you're lucky, you might find they have a good student parent network, or that they're working with the university to improve financial support, etc. And, as u/MasterBulldog said, doing work with an SU (being on their trustee board, being a rep, helping to run a society) will look pretty good on a CV, if you have the time to do that.

The engine had two sets of contact breaker points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.

I don't just trust them. They can gain my trust though.

In my opinion, Douglas has displayed integrity and a sincere conviction in which I can relate, and in which gives me faith in him as a politician. Take, for example, when he defected to UKIP. He had a career ahead of him and, at the beginning of a term, he defected. He was being highly critical of the disingenuity and cartel like politics the mainstream parties endorsed. Upon defection, he also resigned, in which was unnecessary. He gave his constituency a by election so they can keep him out if, being a candidate of the radical UKIP, they wanted to. Suggesting that he isn't in it for the pay or career. It was, to my knowledge, also pretty unheard of (I'll expect a few others). He has in my experience also yet to show dishonesty. I haven't seen him hurl abuse, deflect questions, frame opposition/quote mine or throw hate - he hasn't been proven guilty. He refused a standard taxpayer funding for the party in which ~~we needed~~ would've went a long way and was entirely acceptable.

My point is that I think that there are exceptions.

I'm sure the club has a plan in mind though. Our squad without big transfers would still be more than competitive in England, but to stay *head and shoulders* above the rest we need players. And also to catch up with Barca/Bayern/Madrid. We can't deny that we're weak in depth, our main two strikers (Costa and Remy) are amazing but injury prone. Falcao is NOT reliable in his current state. In addition, we need midfield reinforcements too and I think everyone agrees with that.

All I'm saying is we cannot afford to get complacent. We know we cannot reach Barca/Bayern's level without some serious **world class** talent coming in. That's the thing about the new Chelsea isn't it? Ambition and the will to win, which has evaporated from Arsenal and Liverpool. 

I'll be more than happy with more domestic success but we need to aim higher each year and ensure that if/when we face European heavyweights we are seen as equals, even with a few injuries in key areas.

I'm not an expert by any means, but I'm pretty sure this is a big difference. afaik, the police need to have reasonable evidence/suspicion on a case by case basis to have those grounds before they can knock someone's door down. Right?

By comparison it's no longer a secret that GCHQ has little to no oversight. The same parallel does not exist; they would not have any need for any sort of prior evidence before feeling they have the right to access your data if they could. I was just rereading one of [Snowden's early interviews](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-interview-transcript) which is relevant here:

&gt;**The NSA’s British partner, GCHQ, and whether it is worse**

&gt;Their respect for the privacy right, their respect for individual citizens, their ability to communicate and associate without monitoring and interference is not strongly encoded in law or policy. And the result of that is that citizens in the United Kingdom and citizens around the world who are targeted by the United Kingdom, by the UK government, by UK systems, by UK authorities, they’re at a much greater risk than they are in the United States.

&gt;You’ve got their own admission in their own documents that “we’ve got a much lighter oversight regime than we should have”, full stop. That’s what they’re talking about. They enjoy authorities that they really shouldn’t be entitled to. And the problem with that is, when you have an unrestrained intelligence agency that’s not being well overseen, that’s not accountable to the public, they’re going to go further than they need to. They’re going to overreach. They’re going to implement systems and policies and target people who are not necessary to target.

&gt;Tempora [GCHQ’s internet surveillance program] is really proof … that GCHQ has much less strict legal restrictions than other western government intelligence.

&gt;The UK government may publicly say, “We have very strict regulations. There’s a broad oversight. There’s intense accountability for all of these officials operating these programs”. Their own private documents, classified documents they never expect the public to see, say something very different, which is, “We have a very light oversight regime compared to all other western countries”.

Bear in mind that the oversight in the NSA for example was (at that point) already extremely limited, so that's really saying something. I recommend reading (or watching) more of the interview. The situation has not improved since then as far as I'm aware. In fact with these proposals ([and others that have already been passed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237108)) it seems things are moving in the opposite direction, if anything.",null,0,null,1436564387,null,0,false,0,csz2bif,null,t3_3cs5wf,null,t1_csz2bif,null,t1_csz0x12,null,null,null,1437753561,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I watched maybe 15 or so Wolfsburg games this season and although I couldn't pay as much attention as I would have liked, I got to see a fair amount of KDB.

Aside from his pace and good finishing touch, KDB is a very creative player both on and off the ball. For those of you who are most familiar with English soccer, I would compare his role in a team to that of Mesut Özil. They move differently (Özil is a bit shiftier, while I think de Bruyne is stronger), but they are both critical playmakers. Neither of them will ever be the top scorer on a team, but they are both usually the person who most consistenly makes the penultimate pass or initiates a scoring sequence.

I think City are interested because they believe that David Silva has the ability to be this assist wizard we all know him to be, while de Bruyne will have the ability to get Silva the ball in a good position to make that last pass.

**TL;DR: KDB often makes the always underappreciated 2nd to last pass that sets up scoring opportunities and creates chances for a club.

Meh I just don't think this was all Sterling's fault, none of this would have happened if his contract negotiations were all kept under wraps. Calling in sick for training is bad but many players have done it in the past in order to push a move, plus with all shit he was dealing with on the morning he called in sick (spammed with 1000s of phone calls/text messages due to leaked phone number) it's not exactly surprising in my opinion.

](http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/2002----.htm)

In their 1988 book 'Manufacturing Consent - The Political Economy of the Mass Media', Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky introduced their 'propaganda model' of the media. The propaganda model argues that there are 5 classes of 'filters' in society which determine what is 'news'; in other words, what gets printed in newspapers or broadcast by radio and television. Herman and Chomsky's model also explains how dissent from the mainstream is given little, or zero, coverage, while governments and big business gain easy access to the public in order to convey their state-corporate messages - for example, 'free trade is beneficial, 'globalisation is unstoppable' and 'our policies are tackling poverty'.

We have already touched upon the fact that corporate ownership of the media can - and does - shape editorial content. The sheer size, concentrated ownership, immense owner wealth, and profit-seeking imperative of the dominant media corporations could hardly yield any other result. It was not always thus. In the early nineteenth century, a radical British press had emerged which addressed the concerns of workers. But excessive stamp duties, designed to restrict newspaper ownership to the 'respectable' wealthy, began to change the face of the press. Nevertheless there remained a degree of diversity. In postwar Britain, radical or worker-friendly newspapers such as the Daily Herald, News Chronicle, Sunday Citizen (all since failed or absorbed into other publications) and the Daily Mirror (at least until the late 1970s) regularly published articles questioning the capitalist system.

The well-known journalist John Pilger joined the Mirror in 1963, and worked there for over 20 years. Pilger later claimed that 'The Mirror was the first popular paper to encourage working-class people to express themselves, for whatever reason, to their newspaper'. Luckily for him, 'Irreverence and a certain anarchy were encouraged'. Later, when Robert Maxwell took over ownership of the newspaper, Pilger was personally assured that his job was secure: 'Eighteen months later, after relentless interference from Maxwell, I was sacked.'

The media typically comprise large conglomerates - News International, CBS (now merged with Westinghouse), Turner Broadcasting (now merged with Time-Warner) - which may belong to even larger parent corporations such as General Electric (owners of NBC). All are tied into the stock market. Wealthy people sit on the boards of these major corporations, many with extensive personal and business contacts in other corporations. Herman and Chomsky point out, for instance, that: 'GE [General Electric] and Westinghouse are both huge, diversified multinational companies heavily involved in the controversial areas of weapons production and nuclear power.' It is difficult to conceive that press neutrality would not be compromised in these areas. **But more widely, press freedom is limited by the simple fact that the owners of the media corporations are driven by free market ideology. How likely is it, then, that such owners would happily allow their own newspaper, radio or TV station to criticise systematically the 'free market' capitalism which is the source of his material wealth?**",null,0,null,1436565247,null,0,false,0,csz2x66,null,t3_3ctw9l,null,t1_csz2x66,null,t3_3ctw9l,null,null,null,1437754068,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

---

&gt;The age of consent in [England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales) is __16__  regardless of sexual orientation or gender, as specified by the [Sexual Offences Act 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003).  However, if person A is over the age of 18 and is in a [position of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_trust) to person B who is under the age of 18, it is illegal for A to engage in sexual activity with B.  Section 47 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 makes it an offence to pay for or promise payment for sexual services of a person under 18 where the 'client' does not reasonably believe that person is over 18, or in any event for a person under 13.

A lot of work is being done by hand, at any cost, as regulation requires it. Or automation is impossible, automation is financially unviable or the lead time to developed the automation would conflict with the production.

Not only that but there will always be small firms (sub 100 staff) that are working by hand. I work for a multinational company with a lot of overhead in R&amp;D for medical and defense, we automate when we can but its less common then you would expect. A £25k CAPEX on a single machine for a single task is a lot to ask when you may need 10 or more different machines to complete a single product and then perhaps more than one of each for volume. That and you require the space for all of them, for all of your lines.

The cost will fall of course, the size will decrease as well but it wont replace an entire workforce. Only high volume, guaranteed long lifetime products are automated to a high percent and even then it is more likely to be off-loaded to a cheaper country such as eastern Europe or china. If we just wanted to eliminate the cost of paying employees in a factory then we would have been paying the Chinese pennies to the pound to do all of our products. We clearly don't because even at a magnitude less in employee costs it isn't beneficial to save that cost over internal skilled staff.

null,false,Crimsoneer,eu,London,null,"Okay, a few corrections.  First, there are absolutely safeguards in place before the government can access any of your communications - you can argue they're laxer than other Western countries, and there might be a perfectly valid argument to be made there, but they absolutely are *there*.  RIPA establishes very thoroughly what level of oversight you need, it's just become somewhat outdated and thus some of the authorities have become routine rubber stamps as opposed to thorough oversight.  That's the argument Snowden has made, and I have no issues with that - there are simply far more data requests than there were where the legislation was created, with the same amount of approvers.  Of course supervision has seriously slipped.

The difference is that for certain software - say, encrypted chat applications based outside the UK - intelligence and law enforcement simply have *no way* of reading those communications under law.  That's not to say it's impossible - while WhatsApp is under no legislative obligation to hand over your communication, they generally will do it if there is imminent life at risk etc - there is no framework for it, and it's done on a case by case basis.  Even where it is possible, via intelligence sharing agreements, it's simply not possible at a speed that makes law enforcement possible.  If someone scams you on Skype, UK police, currently, short of a giant terrorist level emergency, simply *do not have the ability to help*. By the time they get a data request through, any evidence is long gone, oversight or no.

Reddit's always very happy to interpret what Cameron has said as technological idiocy and that he's going to ban all sorts of things, but to me it's been pretty damn clear what he means is that if you're expecting to operate in the UK as a company that handles data, you need to make sure you have the appropriate frameworks in place to let intelligence and law enforcement access that data, where they have the legal power to do so.

Is that such a shocking suggestion?

Here are some excerpts:

&gt; 55	There is a lack of scientific evidence about the welfare implications of hunting

Well that's useful to support your cause.

&gt; 56	The evidence which we have seen suggests that, in the case of the killing of a fox by hounds above ground, death is not always effected by a single bite to the neck or shoulders by the leading hound resulting in the dislocation of the cervical vertebrae. In a proportion of cases it results from massive injuries to the chest and vital organs, although insensibility and death will normally follow within a matter of seconds once the fox is caught. There is a lack of firm scientific evidence about the effect on the welfare of a fox of being closely pursued, caught and killed above ground by hounds. We are satisfied, nevertheless, that this experience seriously compromises the welfare of the fox.

In hindsight, I probably should have made that a lot clearer in the original post. The intention of forcing Grobbelaar to pay for The Sun's legal costs was an act of deterrence to prevent people for suing for libel as it is equivalent to playing a game of Russian roulette as no one knows which way the case is going to end up and it can quite easily end up with the individual committing career suicide.

No doubt if you're on JSA you have a quota to fill, but think for a minute when you see a new company. Can you tell what it is they actually do before you apply? When you start the application process, are they transparent about how much you will earn? If not, send them an email and ask them straight up - employment is a two-way street, and you need to know they aren't wasting your time.

Rebuff weasel words like ""up to"" or ""on target earnings""; every industry has a ballpark figure for entry-level jobs. Retail or cleaning is £14-15k, admin £16-18k, supervisors should be £18-20k. Sales jobs which only pay commission with no basic salary are scams, plain and simple. That's not a job, it's errand-running for people who have no reason to trust the sort of people they hire, which are impressionable 18-21yos. At least the kid on the till at Tesco knows how much he'll take home each month.

With only a small number of exceptions banks deduct Income Tax from interest paid at the Basic Savings Rate.  *(This changed since April and there's an allowance of £5,000 on interest where you don't pay tax now.)*

Unless you're earning enough to pay Higher Rate Income tax you won't have any additional tax to pay over the amount the banks deduct at source.

What this means is that for the vast majority of people there would be nothing to be pay.  On top of this HMRC is spectacularly bad at exploiting the vast amount of data it holds and lacks the resource to work with it, even if they could.

Realistically to comply with health and safety you could need a crane

&gt;The cost of moving some pallets of wood (conveniently designed for safe and easy transport)

They're not all stacked on top of each other in a straight line

&gt;would be more than the cost of rehousing 50+ people, and potentially having to cover the cost of their houses and possessions?

Crane hire, operators, security it all adds up, and that's before costs of a backlash. No one wants some eejit chucking a petrol bomb when someones working on top of it.

&gt;If no one wants to take responsibility for the fires, then there should be no fires, its quite simple.

All evidence says otherwise, people aren't accepting responsibility and there are still fires. 

&gt;If I grab a load of pallets and try to set my local roundabout on fire I'd be arrested in a heartbeat. I understand that trying to dismantle a loyalist bonfire by force could result in riots. But the alternative; put your fingers in your ears, year after year as the fires get bigger and more venomous, and hope the cleanup isn't too messy, is tacit approval for these monstrosities.

I'm not suggesting we do nothing the housing executive did build a bonfire site on one estate, which went down like a lead balloon, it seems like a practical solution to manage damage if you can get them to use it. And if you can't get the criminal courts to do something about it the civil courts definitely could.

&gt;I'm all in favour of councils working with local communities to have safe events celebrating the 12th, but capitulating to a bunch of faceless kids who want to light a big fire, burn effigies of taigs, and get pissed for a night is fucking cowardly. 

Perhaps, there are legitimate risks they have to consider though.


&gt;If the PSNI can force an Orange Order march through Ardoyne year in year out, they can tell a bunch of kids to fuck off while a JCB moves that bonfire - if the political will was there.

Well they don't do that to begin with, and there's a legal difference, and last time they were shot at.

Early on they tried to distance the audio/novel/comic continuities with Zagreus, having the Doctor see each continuity as different universes.  They even turned the Sam reference into a new companion called Samson (which doesn't really work due to the mind wipe mentioned in *Terror Firma*).

Later on however they seemed to embrace it more, with the references I mentioned above and in *The Company of Friends* anthology release.  In these stories we see the Doctor travelling with a novel companion (Fitz), a comic companion (Izzy), and a new audio companion (Mary).

In the Mary story there is a version of the Doctor late in his life.  He mentions companions from all mediums, including:

Novel: Compassion, Trix

Comic: Ssard, Destrii

Audio: Gemma, Mary, Charley, Lucie, Alex

Companions yet to be seen: Todd, Rita

I generally see the novels coming before the audios, with the comics being pretty early on.  There's a problem with Romana being in her third incarnation in the novels ([not to mention ](#s ""the destruction of Gallifrey"") and then meeting him in her second incarnation later in the audios, but I think there's a reset that's implied in *The Gallifrey Chronicles* that could fix this.

I'm not sure, I don't much care either way, we've reinforced our team regardless.

I doubt his career would be ruined staying at Liverpool though, let's face it, he wouldn't be in the reserves for long, and if he desires a euro 2016 spot he would quickly discipline himself.

David Cameron is not a dictator, and cannot force this legislation through. Despite its lack of a written constitution, the UK has a hugely strong rule of law. Even if he tries to, it would still have to get through a vote in the Lords. And could still get struck down by the Supreme Court and the EU.

The PDF is [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228824/8359.pdf). It's 123 pages, so not a short read. I'm only 10 pages in currently. But a cursory search returns zero results for ""WhatsApp"", ""Facebook"", or even ""SSL"". The left wing press are more than capable of sensationalism, and this is a textbook example.

Anyway, what I imagine some people will find interesting is that this bill was originally kicked off by Gordon Brown's Labour Government back in 2008.

Despite the high respect that he experienced during the war, Mohinder Singh believed that war films presented a ""white-only view of the RAF"". He campaigned to have the Sikh contribution to the British war effort, which he believed had been ignored, more widely recognised. He was never invited to any of the many events in Britain that marked the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in 2010, or any other year, he says. He is quoted as saying, ""As far as I think, no one in authority remembers that we are here and we were a part of World War II"".

In terms of goalscoring who do we have? A costa who gets injured every time someone taps his leg, an equally injury prone Remy, an inconsistent Oscar, and then Hazard. Most of those big teams have multiple goalscorers. We rely faaar too much on Hazard. He's either setting someone up or socoring them himself, and even when he's not assisting the goal he almost always plays a big part in it. What if he gets injured? (god forbid) It would be massive, MASSIVE blow. Thankfully he's built like a tank. 

Personally, I think we need midfield depth. Someone who can play against the big teams in europe because I don't feel cesc is quite fit for those games. We need to be able to rotate more as well. We have a small squad that got exhausted midseason.

Btw, what is wrong with having world class players in every position? I don't see lots of fans wondering why the likes of Barca, Real and Bayern keep on signing world class talent while they still have other world class talent warming the bench. Don't forget we have one of the smallest squads in the league. We only have one attacking midfielder on the bench. And, that is quite scary for a big team competing for all the major trophies. One injury to one of those players you mentioned could turn our season for the worse. Last season, our biggest weakness was the central midfielder area. Even though, we looked unstoppable in that area for the vast majority of the season. We needed someone that could help out the likes of Fabregas and Matic. Especially, in the 2nd half of the season. With all his talents, Fabregas was at times lightweight when it comes to controlling the midfield. Matic was a one-man army in some matches. Zouma is amazing prospect like you said, but our Center back are aging. We need to starting planning ahead. So, that can we find a suitable partner for him in the near future. I expected you being a Man U fan would already know what happens when a team takes too long to replace their aging center backs. Just imagine what would have happened, if Man U had already signed decent center backs when the likes of Rio and Vidic were struggling. This season, i think Arsenal would be our biggest threat.

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"None of the ""arguments"" against the tube strike listed in here are idiotic and stupid. When you live in London like I do, a tube strike brings down a vital part of the infrastructure of London which millions of people of use daily and its a general annoyance more than anything. This leads onto my second point, people don't dislike collective action, but when its in one of the busiest cities in Europe, you can start to understand why people get annoyed at the strikers. 

And finally, people's work. This isn't an idiotic argument it's a legitimate one, the ""journalist's"" condescending tone doesn't help her discredit the argument. Let's take a stock broker, they need to get into London as a lot of their money comes from commission, so they have to make sales, so a tube strike causing them to miss out on ab hour hurts them for really no reason. If my dad is late for work he gets bollocked for it as he has to make sure the building he works in doesn't go to shit. There's countless numbers of jobs that are directly affected by a strike in London and they are being punished for no reason. So of course the strikers don't get supported because they aren't really doing much to gain support in the first place. Has the writer of this article tried to get around London during a strike? It's like trying traverse the UK naked, nearly impossible and a sight no one wants to see.

&gt;For some reason, these people have a hard time connecting the fact that workers on the Tube haven't yet been reduced to outright penury with the fact that their unions are actually willing to take action when necessary

The impression most Londoners have is that the Tube continues to go on strike A) when it is unnecessary and B) because they can harm economic activity in completely unrelated sectors across London.

Regardless of whether or not this current strike is justified, the Tube's Union has made a serious of strategic decisions which have destroyed any sympathy people might have had for them.

There's a kind of measly, pathetic ingratitude to all this that's absolutely unique to the British. In any other country they'd at least recognise that the inconvenience is worthwhile. Not here.

So it's not entirely impossible, but it's never confirmed if he does, or how he does, restore Gallifrey.

The inverse of this is to ask if we really want to live in a world where we cannot have any conversation without being uncertain who else is listening, potentially recording everything we say or do, everywhere we go and everyone we have contact with.

I'm not saying there's an obvious answer, both sides involve sacrifices. However in my view we cannot sacrifice our privacy any more than our other fundamental rights, even when it could potentially help keep us safe.

It is very rare for specific plots to be known. If they are, they are followed and prevented. That's the whole point.

What's normally the case is that some particular group or individual is known to the intelligence services as potentially preparing for an act of terrorism. Could be looking at bomb instructions, could be purchasing certain chemicals in bulk, could be communications with other previous terrorists or allied organisations.

That's more difficult to prevent. You know they want to do it, but there are thousands of them. You can't realistically put a trace or surveillance on all of them, it's not affordable and the resources aren't there anyway. So you prioritise.

But like absolutely any analysis of risk, there are sensitivity analyses. Sometimes risk is underestimated, and one of the followed individuals launches an attack before being surveyed by the intelligence services.

The Conservatives have essentially spat at that principle and made a clever money grab, rather than have to deal with the thorny political issue of cutting a non-means tested pensioner perk, they've given the BBC the authority to control who pays the license fee. So the BBC has inherited the free for over 75s policy and the hefty price tag attached leaving them with the choice of continuing it or cutting it and facing pensioner wrath in place of the Conservatives.


Personally I think the BBC should have tried to call Cameron's bluff and say it was cutting free license fee's as it simply cannot afford to pay for them itself and maintain the same level of service. However, that would be a very political stance to take, something the BBC is not comfortable with and probably what Cameron was banking on.

null,false,zPhix,mccoy,McCoy,null,"Before, I would always stick the Charley/Eight stories before the novels and have the Lucie/Eight stories after the novels, but It seems like such a tight fit.

I don't think the 3 year break between *The Eight Doctors* and *Vampire Science* is big enough, especially with the Radio Times companions in there (Stacy and Ssard).

The only other gap I've seen online is between *Interference* and *The Blue Angel* on [this website](http://www.eyespider.freeserve.co.uk/drwho/pm/list.html), but I think that's in the middle of a bunch of Faction Paradox stuff so it seems a bit out of place.

Also, the reference in *The Tomorrow Windows* to a future involving the story *Seasons of Fear* would put the audios after the novels, and as you said there's something about a future where Gallifrey is restored in that novel.

The main issue I find (which is actually the one that made me originally put the novels after 8/Charley) is that Eight meets Romana III in the novels, but mainly interacts with Romana II in the audios.

There's no in-story suggestion for how we'd get from III to II, but since Gallifrey's restoration is unknown, I could see them restoring the planet and the Time Lords to a point before their destruction, maybe even preventing the War in the first place.  This would return Romana II (I've heard Eight didn't have a very good relationship with III), and put her on course for the Gallifrey audio series which seems to be getting closer to the Last Great Time War (I've only heard up to Extermination, so I could be wrong).",null,0,null,1436576404,null,0,false,0,csz9da8,null,t3_3cupxr,null,t1_csz9da8,null,t1_csz8pkb,null,null,null,1437758944,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

He was told the tape that would have answered the crucial question at the trial - was McCauley right in claiming he and Tighe were given no warning before they were shot? - had been destroyed.

What he did not know was that a copy had been taken by a soldier from the army's special collation team monitoring the MI5 bug.

Sterling is good enough for the Champions League and Liverpool can't offer that, so obviously he's going to want to move.

As for me it is pretty hard to pick favorites most of the time so for the purposes of this thread I will just go for Two for the Classic Doctors and Nine for New. 

Two and Nine actually share the ability to go from comically goofy to deadly serious on a dime. I could totally see Two delivering the ""Go to your room"" cliffhanger from The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances exactly as Nine had and conversely I can see Nine threatening Salamander in the exact same way as Two at the end of The Enemy of the World.

Company A mostly email us every so often and give us a period (ie. July 1st - August 31st) and ask if we are available to be 'on call' in this period. This mostly means ""we expect that [new guy] is going to drop out"" or ""we might have illness"" or ""someone has let us know that something might come up"" and about 9/10 times you will end up getting a phone call at 7am asking you to be on the other side of London at 9am with a cheesy grin and a coffee or three in hand. Typically, I don't get paid for agreeing to be on call - mostly because I'm allowed to turn it down if other work is in the way (as with all self-employed people, I have far too much work) - but I get paid an additional fee on top of my hourly rate for any hours I do. 

Company B pay me a retainer for the hours they want me to be on call for (ie. I agree to be available 9am-5pm Monday and in return they pay me £xxx for any inconvenience), and then an additional hourly fee for any hours during that period where I'm working for them.

""More""?  Where were the first ones?  I wasn't baseless to assume you were a legal layman, you admitted so yourself.  It's hardly baseless to say that someone wanting to determine whether a detention is lawful or unlawful *should know what makes a detention lawful or unlawful in the first place*.

There's nothing bizarre about it.  Stop using a hoity-toity academic tone when you've completely failed to answer my very valid points about your so-called ""investigation"", except to tell me I have a promising career in far-right journalism.

&gt;There really is no point talking to you.

Because when you do, you fail to answer any of my points anyway?  I *demolished* your plan for an investigation a couple of weeks ago - I mean I really picked it apart completely.  Tore it to shreds.  *Annihilated* it.  And the best you could come up with as a response was ""oh you should write for the Daily Mail"", making the completely incorrect assumption that anyone who disagrees with you must be right-wing.  

But you were wrong.  I am left-wing and liberal and I happen to have expertise in this field, and it's incredibly frustrating that arrogant know-nothings like yourself feel they can just walk in and tell me ""you did this wrong"".  I've spent years training and accumulating experience of this field and I still don't know everything.  And you think you can just come into it based off a whim and start telling people where they've gone wrong, as if you know anything about it?  How incredibly arrogant of you.  Tell me what you do for a living, maybe I can have a turn at pretending I know anything about that.

I will restate my question again:

&gt;how do you plan to apply your current level of knowledge to the records of an individual prisoner and ascertain whether their detention is lawful or unlawful? What sort of things would you be looking for to determine if their detention were illegal?

It's clear you have no idea how to answer that question.  I'm not making the point that allowing access to prisoner's records is a bad idea.  I'm not going to argue about your identity or that of /u/JosephZernik.  Let's take this back to the original issue at hand.  I'm simply asking you how you plan, by ""next Monday"", to accumulate the necessary legal knowledge to ascertain whether detentions are lawful or unlawful.

I will add another question:

Is it wrong to say that a person who wants to conduct an investigation into whether prisoners are being held lawfully should know what constitutes lawful detention?

It's a good way to get your teeth kicked in. The fact that a black kid was being followed and it is OKAY in your book to do so means that you agree that we should treat ethnicities differently based on the actions of few. So I assume you will agree that we should inherently treat you as a racist, a serial killer and a drunken doctor hitter. But silly me. You are white. You get to be treated as an individual. When I say Random BTW I mean Trayvon Martin was guilty of the crime of walking while Black.

2. Zimmerman had no legal right to challenge and accost Trayvon. None. In the UK this would have been considered manslaughter. Trayvon got assaulted, Defended Himself and Zimmerman was forced to pull out a lethal weapon. If you chased me in your car, got out and attacked me demanding that I explain myself on public property, in the UK I am entitled to hit you and defend myself. The fault lies in Zimmerman. The fact is clear. If Zimmerman had killed a white kid, he would have faced gaol. And oh?  The best part of the ruling in  Florida was that no one was wrong. Trayvon was legally justified in fighting Zimmerman and Zimmerman in killing Trayvon. It's a fucked up law to protect gun owners. 

3. It wasn't an unfamiliar neighbourhood, it was his father's neighbourhood. He was on the way to the store. I don't see George Zimmerman following white boys. And remember Ethnic Indian here. White people are more likely to be criminals than us in the UK. Must I ask every white man who walks past the house what he is doing there? No. That's batshit stupid.

4. That's good. Did you follow any white paedophiles who touched up kids in churches, schools and hospitals and who prey on children in developing countries? Or did you follow some darkies around until you found one committing a crime vindicating all the other Asians you scared the fuck out off. And this is assuming you actually follow around Asians all day like some racist ninja. 

5. Oh dear. If you are aware there are probably a lot more victims of those gangs from the Pakistani community who probably still remain in  silence due to a culture where rape is a loss of honour. They probably are keeping quiet because it would effectively mark them as damaged goods. 

6. Why are white people such child molesters in Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand. Oh wait. Overgeneralisations from a minority of bad people about the majority. Why is it that your people have to rape poor South East Asian people. Isn't it bad enough that you killed Millions and supported horrific dictators such as Pol Pot? No wait. Those fuckers are indi-fucking-viduals who are responsible for their actions as murderers, supporters of genocidal regimes and indeed nonces. As I stated. This is something you can never fucking understand cause you pass as white and aren't judged by the actions of a minority.

Rotherham? Okay. Rotherham was a failure of policing. The same failure of policing that allowed so many white priests to molest so many children and when caught to be allowed to move to countries like Africa or India or be placed in charge of Rural Australian, Canadian and South American churches where they could molest and get away with a lot more. The issue here was that the police were terrified of being racist. So they refused to ask the simple  question ""Hey, is this racist?"". Asians DID come forward to report abuse but nothing was done. I know because my aunt was an Asian victim of abuse in the 80's and the police did nothing about it for around 15 years. What the police did was empower that behaviour of these criminal gangs in the same way that a culture of silence and police compliance lead to the empowerment of Catholic Priests and of Jimmy Saville and of the MP Paedophilia scandal.

Personal information should stay personal, private, secret, above all else.  If a prisoner does not want their information in the public domain, that should be respected.

Also Koke plays on the left in a 4-4-2 or as a left winger in a 4-3-3 if he's playing on a wing. He spent most of his time playing on the left in their 4-4-2 this year.

/u/ocyn Torres is not first team quality, he'll likely be the third choice striker for Atletico after Vietto's acquisition. Correa had heart surgery and was just recently unveiled by Atletico.

Either way your stretching with your stats.  Career goals are irrelevant and so are Balotelli's hopeless pot shots he takes after he kills our counter attacks by dropping outside the box.  You don't look at Rickie Lambert and say he has a better goal record than Harry Kane so he must be better.  You look at their recent form because that's what your most likely to get.  Form since 2012 is easily in favor of Benteke, not even debatable.  Really a better discussion would be how much better Sturridge is than Benteke, the gap isn't as large as it is between Balotelli and Benteke.

I also thought that this would allow me to use my own personal finances to get another mortgage on my own (personal) property rather than having the difficulties of trying to obtain 2 mortgages as an individual.

Sound familiar?

That said, the biggest similarity I see between the two is that they are both incredibly fun teams to watch that will in the end only leave you heartbroken.

 It doesn't matter how many shots Balotelli takes if none of them go in.  You don't sign a player because he takes a lot of shots you sign him because he scores a lot of goals.  Simply watching Balotelli is enough to know he isn't good enough.  He lacks a killer instinct and he doesn't play like a striker.

The royals are only req'd to stay neutral to please the queen; there is no law stating they [must](http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/Queenandvoting.aspx). 

A commoner member of the royal family can run for PM. Zara Phillips for example is member of the family but a commoner.  However, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, etc. cannot.  They are not commoners and cannot sit in the House of Commons. The titled royals can however sit in the House of Lords.  According to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) though, the Parliament Act of 1911 means that the PM is chosen from the House of Commons.  

HOWEVER, choosing the PM in this manner is convention. TECHNICALLY, the queen can choose whomever she wants as PM, including Charles or Andrew or even George. She typically chooses the leader of the party with most votes but she isn't compelled to do so. It is HER MAJESTY'S government and not that of the people.  

This applies in all of her realms incl. Canada, Aus, NZ. It is a myth that the monarch does not have power. She chooses not to exercise her power but there is nothing stopping her from doing so if she wishes.

I think next season will be difficult again.  A lot of mid table teams are strengthening to formidable sides.  West Ham, Stoke, Swansea, Palace are all making solid moves.  Arsenal may finally put in a title run and Chelsea are Chelsea.  United and City are anyone's guess with both sides probably going to spend an ass load of money.  

However I think it will be a successful season.  I was thinking back to last season, and I thought last season was a moderately successful season.  Two semi final appearances, a chance at the top four until the last month, a (brief) stint in the CL and Europa and sixth place finish.  While none of that is ideal, when you consider all the factors of last season taken together I'm sort of surprised they did as well as they had.  

I like Rodgers, I think he is a good manager.  He has his faults and he lacks some top level experience but he seems to learn from his mistakes.  I do not think he will be manager this time next year barring a top four finish and even then I'm not so sure.  I think Klopp will be brought in at some point in 2016. 

In short I think next year LFC can be successful under Rodgers.

However to bring boatloads of soldiers over, Hitler needed one of two things: either sea superiority or air superiority.

The RAF won.

Also it is our full squad that makes it hard to sign anyone. Nobody wants to come in as a second choice, and nobody in our team wants to be pushed down the pecking order. This is completely different situation than last season. 

Charlie Austin is not the answer because we already have all striker positions full. I personally do not want Remy to go in order to bring in Austin. Remy is such a power sub.

Also, I still believe Pogba could come in, and Oscar to go out. Pogba's love for Chelsea, and Allegri's love for Oscar just seem too big to be ignored. 

On the other hand, ""mediocre"" buys (moneywise 15-20 mil. €), like Aranguiz. Could do the same job as signing Pogba. Because it means Oscar could stay. 

However, transfer period could be a bit unpredictable because Mikel that counts as homegrown seems to be on his way out. That means we will probably go for someone HG. Maybe Stones, but we don't actually need him. we need LB, shift Azpi right, and Iva in the centre.

Talking about financial management is a bit rich for Palace with Selhurst Park having awful infrastructure for years, poor management with other London clubs as tenants to Selhurst.

It happens again that I have to say UKIP has nothing to do with anything like r/european - indeed the sort of mentality and submission by the senior mods themselves wouldn't even be entertained by the party.  To even become a member of the party you have to declare that you have nothing to do with the things the senior mods have issues with.

UKIPPARTY even took /r/european out of their side panel with their mods saying they had put it there without any screening protocol (Something I have issue with - but not that it matters since 2 mods mod there too).

A majority of their people when polled wanted nothing to do with it.

In a secondary poll a majority again said that they wanted their mods to not even share with them on the grounds of 'free speech' (although they happen to ban an awful lot for that excuse to apply).  A significant proportion of those that even didn't want shared mods said so on a basis of 'not wanting to tell someone' but still expressed concern.

#UKIP has no similitude to /r/european.  If you even expressed some of the thinking of the senior mods as a member you'd have your membership revoked.

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"&gt; If you can't afford kids, don't have them.

I'm surprised people actually say this and are being serious.

First, let's examine how much money you need to 'afford kids'. Life changes along the course of itself. Therefore, it's a good idea to be prepared for that. You really should be prepared to lose your job completely and permanently tomorrow. Therefore your total amount of savings you need before even considering having kids needs to be enough to support yourself, your partner, and a dependent for 21+ years. 


You need to have that amount already *before* having sex, with or without a condom, since they can break, or other sorts of failure can occur. Don't for one second think any kind of contraception is 100% effective, so yes.. just don't have sex. Nothing works better than abstinence. If you have enough cash right now to support your prospective family for all those years, shag away, but make sure you've factored twins or even triplets into that budget. Hmmm... are we in the billions yet? Definitely comfortably in the millions anyway.

Now let's think about society and culture. We have immigration. Immigration from countries where people don't typically say 'if you can't afford kids, don't have them'. I'm reasonably sure that if the English restrict the right to breed to 'multi-millionaires and above' only, immigration will take care of the rest. Therefore, that 'British culture' Conservatives are so fond of will be completely gone. Not imaginarily threatened by the lack of armed guards on the borders, but actually eradicated.

EDIT:

Did a tiny amount of number crunching, and I decided a reasonable amount to be on to 'afford kids' is 25k per parent, making a household income of 50k per year. This should be ample for anyone who doesn't aspire to owning their own house. For the 21 year bar (which I took from the new limit at which young people are entitled to government support... may rise in future) a person should have £1,050,000 in the bank to say with any degree of certainty they 'can afford kids'. Please be reminded that this figure is pretty much a minimum. Situations change, so the prospective parent needs to be prepared for job losses, change of partner (new partner might be unemployed, which is why the 1.05 million is not a shared figure) and a plethora of other circumstances which are usually unforeseen but can dramatically affect your ability to afford kids.",null,0,null,1436604059,null,0,1436604639,0,cszk1yq,null,t3_3csah2,null,t1_cszk1yq,null,t3_3csah2,null,null,null,1437766393,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

As you were referenced in this PM, and as I'm so beyond giving a fuck about what is said and what is not said 'in person' (I have literally nothing to hide - as I suspect nor do you in this particular matter), then I'm willing to go the one-bound-beyond and Control+V exactly what I said to the other person.

As I see it if someone thinks I am saying stuff on the sly, then, in being adamant that I'm not, you get to see the PMs too, given that you raised the initial thread.

PM@Erowidtrance

     This isn't to bitch and moan per se.  Nor is it going 
     to be nice.  Rather, you bitched when you thought 
     I didn't say it to your face  directly last time (although 
     it was a thread directed to mods, so where you got off 
     on being so precious I'm not so sure.)  So this is your 
     heads up that people are either talking shit about you 
     again, or raising issue with your connection with 
     r/european.

     Again your link to a racist group has become an issue, 
     or others are making the links between the white 
     supremacist subreddit you mod and whose mods you 
     sit under and the /r/ukipparty subreddit itself.  Again 
     people have to state that your /r/european isn't 
     indicative.  Even people that don't like the party are 
     voluntarily saying you're not indicative, or at least 
     drawing distinctions between the different types of 
     supporters.

     And AGAIN look at the person initially raising it 
     (again not I).  A user called  /u/RememberThe14Words    


     The 14 words is a WHITE SUPREMACIST TERM.

     That's who your continued association with that 
     group is bringing in.  Are there an enough 'I Told 
     You So's in even a crate of them?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words

        But, hey.  So you know I'm not talking about you 
        behind your back.  Again:  somebody else raised it 
        but I feel I have to respond when I do.

What cap? I'm talking about how much money you need to be able to afford kids. More babies = more money needed. A twin doesn't live on fresh air. Anyone who wants everyone to pay their own way is going to have to stop having sex until they're millionaires, because that's the only way you can guarantee you'll be able to afford that family for the entire time you'll have to. Alternatively, we can continue paying tax that supports our society in a socio-economic climate where entire industries are set to disappear almost overnight, and therefore ensure that all children get at least a half-decent chance of getting somewhere in life, rather than restricting whose children get to survive and whose don't.

&gt; Why should people have to subsidise the large families of others though?

I don't know. Why exactly do we subsidise all these pensioners sitting around waiting to die instead of leaving that to their own families to do?

Oh right... because it's the humane thing to do. Yup, same applies. In both cases, we're looking after people who are not of working age, giving them a dignified life.

However, what I think the sentiment he's trying to get across, or people like myself try to get across, is that people shouldn't have a significant number of children without being able to potentially support them themselves or without assistance from the government. They should accept the fact that government assistance could unfortunately disappear within their child's first 21 years and factor that into their plans. We can't predict the future, but it's not irrational to suggest that people also factor whether or not they are able to hold down a job - even if it's not their current one - for the next 21 years as well.
Furthermore, it's not outrageous to think that child benefit is a great notion and works well, but fails to scale for larger families and can lead to a decreased quality of life.  
That's what I took from that anyway. I'm of the opinion that what we have had is the least worst yet.

Edit: Going to expand on the minimum wage point, as I find that quite infuriating. The proposed Basic Income is about one quarter of the UK Living Wage. Currently, the National Minimum Wage plus the proposed Basic Income would pretty much put you exactly on the Living Wage (30p per hour over on a 40 hour week, to be precise). And they want to abolish the minimum wage- meaning that most minimum wage workers will be below a living wage after this plan were implemented, perhaps even more than currently.

Say you want to aim for £20,000 household income at 45.

In order to achieve an income of £20,000, you will need an invested capital sum (in today's money) of ~ £600,000 (I'm erring on the side of caution because you need to ensure the income can grow in line with inflation).

This depends on your ability to ignore debt, but instead of having ""pay down debt first ordered by interest rate"" I'd rephrase to ""pay down debt until interest rates are lower than savings account interest, then save instead"".  

Couple of things:  
- you have too many variables. A rough plan and savings rate is good, but until you know how much you need to live you cannot know how far from FI you are.  Budget. Get YNAB.   
- if you plan to retire at 45 anything in pensions will be inaccessible for 12 years. They are worth it IMO but work out how much the tax benefits and employer match are saving you and make sure it's not your only source of funds  
- Rental properties are not as amazing as you might think. With one property you may only just break even and it's a big illiquid risk if you're living off it. If I had a wholly paid off property I'd either sell it and buy 4 more on finance or sell it and put the money elsewhere. For me it only makes sense as a leveraged investment but my attitude to risk is high.   
- if you can do this on minimum wage, imagine how quickly you could do it on twice that. If at all feasible, invest in yourself.   
- kids will kill this. Who is going to look after them? You will lose a full wage in childcare or a stay at home parent.

You may well be put onto some sort of emergency payment (like the emergency tax code) so the firm knows they have you covered for NI.  This will probably be higher than your usual NI contributions and you may be able to claim back at a later date when you have your number.

I have given examples of tabloid popularity on prime time over virtually zero reporting of reality. I have given an example of power attempting to bury scientific reality because of financial factors. I have given one plain example of trying to present 'evidence' to show a false view that attacks those with less power.

The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.

A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,

And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;

A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread

The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.

I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,

And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;

But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed

To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,

Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,

The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.

His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run

Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?

The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,

But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.

God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear

The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.

My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,

Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,

But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,

And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;

For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,

Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.

Besides, every week we don't sell Sterling and he doesn't sign a new contract is at least £75,000 saved for us.

That's effectively a £24m benefit whereas if we sell him now for £44m we have to pay him £6m and QPR £8.8m meaning we effectively end up with about £29m.

Mitchell had a reputation in the Commons as an arsehole and one poster on ukpolitics who works in the civil service told us how he had treated him like dirt. However the flip side of these anecdotes is that it suggests that he probably had as almost as much contempt for white collar workers as for the working classes and if all politicians were as bad as him, he wouldn’t have had a reputation as a nasty piece of work. To me it seems inevitable that people who do that job that will end up feeling that they are more important than the rest of us and I was actually felt that the amount shock this story generated was a bit over the top.

Due to the rapid expansion of the first Islamic caliph, they absorbed a lot of tribal discord and adding to the mix of religion, causes divides to widen further. 

You then had the Crusades which would unite Islam in a holy war, but this was sporadically done between 1095-1291 as they were content in fighting against each other. 

The Ottomans then take over and unite the Middle east for a while, until the Ottoman empire became ""the sick man"" of Europe. 

In the 20th century the rise of nationalism in those ex-Ottoman countries occurred, which would also take a sectarian line between the different groups of Islam

I think JC will come 3rd or a close 2nd. It all depends on who drops out first. If LK drops out first, I suspect her 2nd prefs will go to Cooper, which will then get her ahead of Corbyn but lose to Burnham. If Yvette loses first, I think more of her 2nd prefs will go to Burnham so Liz will get knocked out in 3rd and Corbyn will get 2nd.

In terms of personal anecdotes: My mum lives in a rural constituency, my dad in a city marginal. My mum's CLP nommed Corbyn but meetings are very poorly attended and the chair used to be in Militant. Out of 55k new members, said CLP only had 78 since the election. I know a few of these new members, none of them went to the meeting but none of them are voting for Corbyn and all are putting him 4th.

My Dad is in a fairly marginal seat that nommed Cooper. Corbyn went out in the first round in a packed meeting, followed by LK, then AB. Yet again, I'm quite good friends with a fair few Labour people around here, and very few who didn't go to the meeting are voting Corbyn.

Therefore, I think the CLP nominations are a bit misleading. Burnham is still the clear favourite in this contest (and not everyone who signed up as a supporter is voting for Corbyn).",null,0,null,1436610387,null,0,false,0,cszldlh,null,t3_3cwfa5,null,t1_cszldlh,null,t3_3cwfa5,null,null,null,1437767158,null,4,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

The only way to force feed in the instance of hunger strike is to obtain a court order, in this case would they not likely rule to begin feeding via TPN as the patient would consent to that?

Taking her under a mental health section would be the option if she were suffering from an eating disorder and then a forced feeding regime in best interest would be applicable. But this is not the same. 

Personally as an ITU nurse, I would refuse to force any feeding in the above scenario as patient consent has not been gained and the patient clearly has capacity.

This is what the terrorists want.  One of their aims is for us in the West to believe that all Muslims are the same as them, so that ordinary Muslims will be feared, and feel isolated and rejected in their adopted countries, and so rise up against them.

But not all Muslims are the same.  Even radical extremists differ in their interpretation of what it is to be a Muslim, and how they should view the world.

The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who interpret the Quran in a completely different way. Just like most Christians don't interpret the book of Deuteronomy literally. They just want to get on with their lives, like you and me.  They might look a bit different, believe slightly different things about God and how to worship him, but in real terms none of it makes much difference on day to day matters.

null,false,Gryff-,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,null,"Islamism not ""new"" but it's not exactly old. Wahhabists throughout the 19th century would raid southern iraq and syria with the aim of destroying local shrines to saints. Along with the occasional village massacre. They were a serious problem for the Ottoman Empire, an Empire whose Sultan embodied a mix of religious and earthly authority. So it'd be stupid to entirely blame the west, but we also cannot deny the role the west has had in destabilising the region for centuries, and having no respect for elected governments like Mossadeqs in 1953. 

Political revolution in the MIddle East traditionally is bound up with religious language, if not religious character, even if it isn't exclusively religious. It should be no surprise the Ulama of Iran played a role in hijacking the 1979 Iranian revolution, for example. A revolution which was a response to an irresponsible Shah who cared not for his people, and was a replacement for the democratically elected government of Mossadeq. 

Edit - 

I think one of hte many problems is Westerners and Western-born radicalists viewing Islam through the prism of modern western thought. Islam is a generally decentralised religion, at least traditionally. It mixed in with various cultural habits. We, with our literalist take on religion, and the radicalists who have internalised this standard naturally want to reach a ""purer"" islam which has never ever existed. This isn't to say modern western thought is necessarily incompatible, nor compatible. That's another can of worms.

Where it's more serious with judges is that they already lack diversity in reflecting the nation they preside over in all three categories. with the lack of a final salary pension the career choice for historically disadvantaged sector even less attractive, because as a lot of research shows that these sectors will make choices that are more financially secure to fortify themselves. 

So let's take the case of a woman with a family, she's more likely to say in private practice than consider a bench position because the financial cost of her having a family are already penalising her, so why take another hit and go sit on the bench?

Islam was in a sense a pan-arabian ideology with which to unite disparate tribes and classes of the arabian peninsular. They became a natural challenge to the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires respectively.  The spread of Christianity through Europe was similarly violent, as was dealing with alleged heresies. This ranges from the Albigensian Crusades to the Northern/Baltic Crusades and Charlemagne's campaigns in Saxony where hundreds were slaughtered. Likewise Christianity played a role of, well, a pan-european glue of sorts in the absence of the Roman Empire. It was a way of both expanding earthly/secular power and relating across a continental community of sorts. Likewise for Islam. They're not TOO different. Yet somehow we don't have people claim that about modern christianity in relation to the the Anglican Church. 

You might say, well that's because modern christianity has calmed down. Indeed, it generally has. What is there about Islam that says it cannot adapt to the 21st century, or the modern world as seen through Western eyes? 

So a lot of the injunctions in islam are from this sort of context. The question then is to what parts of it are relevant and useful for the 21st century in contemporary islamic society?

 I believe the London Underground wanted to force through new working hours requiring all drivers to work an unlimited number of night &amp; weekend hours without a corresponding increase in pay. The strike action was part of the leverage the workers had in negotiations with London Underground &amp; since they did not relent on their side a strike was called. Now they go back to negotiations (I would think) &amp; we will see whether an agreement can be met somewhere in the middle.

I would tend to side with the workers in this due to my opinion that we should work to live, not live to work; so implementing mandatory unsocial working hours for all staff is unfair (night-staff are generally a dedicated shift so you don't cause the medical health problems associated with unstructured sleep patterns) &amp; that workers should be allowed time to spend with their families &amp; at leasure. However I am not sure if they have the leverage they may think they do due to the increasing simplicity of automating a lot of the processes with rail travel, so while I agree with their position I am not sure the strike will work in their favour.

But it does. You're mistaking the intention of the law verses the structural effects and the social consequences. We know historically that women, ethnic minorities and people from working class background will be AFFECTED by the change detrimentally. 

The idea that it have the same effect just is not true. the majority of nursing staff are women in that age group. This is because society was structured in a way that women were routed into the profession more than men. This means that profession is gendered in a way that when the final salary pension changes come through these women are being punished for the choice that was to some extent coerced as a result of their gender. 

So yeah - the law is everyone before X date is affected, but the social structure and the outcomes are vastly different based on your race, gender and class.

Bikes can be dangerous but vehicles and HGV are more so by magnitudes.

It like comparing having a pebble thrown at you compared to a brick or large rock.

&gt;*Cyclists deserve the respect of other road users, and the only way we can gain this is by respecting the rules of the road (even if it means adding precious seconds onto that commute).*

This shows your gaping naivety.

So only until all cyclists obey the rules of the road are they to be shown respect? What about the vehicles drivers distracted because theyre using their mobiles? Will they notice that cyclists are obeying the rules of the road so can show their respect?

The simplest way to implement that vulnerable road users are shown the respect they deserve is to have strict, or presumed liability.

Once vehicle drivers know that they will be considered responsible for all collisions unless they can prove, or evidence suggests otherwise, they will drive with more consideration.

At the moment, the situation is that drivers act with impunity. You can sit at any main junction in zone 1 and see mobile phone usage, RLJing (and not just creeping across the lights but blasting through, and as I said at the start, thats magnitudes of kinetic energy compared to a bicycle), dangerous driving through ignorance, incompetence or inconsideration and incredible levels of arsehole parking.

Cyclists will never get the ""respect they deserve"" just by obeying the law. It will come through redesigning infrastructure to remove conflict where ever possible and redesigning areas where it cant, to favour the most vulnerable, implementing and application of presumed liability and current driving regulations, the end of allowing 'hardship case' pleading to retain licences after driving convictions (currently around 10,000 drivers have more than 12 points on their licences - one guy in Liverpool has 46), and the mass rollout of permeability routes through backstreets to stop 'rat running' which will result in making it less convenient to drive rather than walk, cycle or take public transport.",null,0,null,1436617042,null,0,false,0,cszmvns,null,t3_3ceqra,null,t1_cszmvns,null,t1_csvdkum,null,null,null,1440486444,null,3,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,3,null

Additionally in the past I've read Said's Orientalism and Zubaida's Beyond Islam. The former looks at Western depictions and understanding of the East as a homogenous lump, as a sort of mirror image of the West and the clash of civilisations narrative and the latter looks at understanding the Middle East without making Islam the main prism.

notice how they attempt a postive spin on the numbers, by highlighting in big bold letters/colours in an infograph that 93% should obey british laws, the headline is 'Most British Muslims 'oppose Muhammad cartoons reprisals'

Do you not think the more important part of that poll was that 24% justified violence for cartoons or sympathised with terrorists? notice how its  down at the bottom of the infograph, in plain black text and worded ambigiously.

compare the same article and statistics among the rest of the press, can you see the bias? http://i.imgur.com/wqkDMaO.png

and heres the hate crime statistics, youre not taking into account population size, why is it when the muslim population grows the hate crime for jews soars? the poll about british muslims being responsible for 25% of homophobic hate crimes was accidental release on the polices behalf because they dont usually state ethnicity and religious backgrounds.

And your attitude typically misses the point with the argument for diversity. The arguemnt isn't that a white male middle class judge will always rule in favour of his own class. The argument is that by the nature of who it attracts the disadavantage and injustice becomes SYSTEMIC.

Remember the evidence of intitutional racism found inthe Stephen Lawrence inquiry and the evidence of systemic malpractice in the Hillsborough inquiry wasn't because the people at the top were ALL consciously trying to undermine justice - but that those who were could use the inherent biases of the system to carry this out in a racial or class based manner.

By preventing the diversity and not equalising effects of policy, those systemic balances can be hard to shift regardless of conscious efforts to do otherwise.

One of the most famous was when British soldiers and RUC officers planted a bomb in the minibus of one of the most popular bands in Ireland at the time with the intention of making it look like the band were IRA bomb smugglers who accidentally blew themselves up. Former members of the  Intelligence services have claimed the attack was planned by themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Showband_killings. 

&gt;According to former Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agent Captain Fred Holroyd, the killings were organised by British Army Captain Robert Nairac (a member of 14th Intelligence Company), in collaboration with the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and its commander Robin ""The Jackal"" Jackson

The 'bad apples' claim has not been taken seriously by anyone outside government since the early 70's. Rather there was a whole rotten orchard, with decisions to carry out attacks like these being made at a higher level. At the very least, practically everyone agrees that Mi5, MoD and high level RUC officers knew that these 'false flag' attacks were occurring and they knew who was carrying them out, but they took no action to stop them.  

Not exactly what you're looking for but theres also numerous cases where attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries were blamed on the IRA despite there being solid evidence that it was not the IRA e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk%27s_Bar_bombing

Do try to get to them in order if you can; I believe Resurrection of Mars is actually a series 4 Eighth Doctor Adventure with Lucie, and I believe it's a part 2 to a previous story (Deimos) which is not the ideal place to jump in, haha.

I'm not sure how BBC Radio has ordered/released them, but the Eighth Doctor stories started in Big Finish's main range with his companion Charley, and they later spun him off into his own range with Lucie which was structured more like the modern show with one-hour stories, and they've since been primarily using him in boxsets that include 4 one-hour stories.

His stories are most impactful when listened to in order; without getting too specific or spoilery, since the launch of the modern series, they've been developing him by breaking him down, intending to make him into the kind of weathered Doctor who could fight in the Time War; since the introduction of the War Doctor, they've altered their course a bit, but even with that context, Eight has suffered a lot so that by the time Night of the Doctor rolls around, he's been damaged and broken down so much that regenerating into the War Doctor makes sense for him. His character development up to that point is kind of heartbreaking, since young Eight is such a happy puppy of a Doctor, haha.

I don't know what BBC iPlayer has given you, but just for your reference, the rough basic Big Finish Eight chronology (not including novels/prose short stories) is as follows:

* 1996 TV Movie (rough as it is, it shows Seven's regeneration into Eight and gives some context, and is McGann's first story)
* The Silver Turk
* The Witch from the Well
* Army of Death
* Storm Warning
* Sword of Orion
* The Stones of Venice
* Minuet in Hell
* Invaders from Mars
* The Chimes of Midnight
* Seasons of Fear
* Embrace the Darkness
* The Time of the Daleks (this ties in with Dalek Empire, one of Big Finish's spinoffs; it's technically part 4 of that arc with previous Doctors' stories preceding it, but if you're following a single Doctor's arc, it falls here for Eight)
* Neverland
* Zagreus (this marks the beginning of what, overall, I consider a lesser era of Eight stories; there's some VERY strong material here and some great stories, but also some really frustrating filler with strong ideas and poor, or worse, dull, execution. Judge for yourself!)
* Scherzo (this at least is excellent; maybe you'll like the stories after this more than I do)
* The Creed of the Kromon
* The Natural History of Fear (another great one, though not at all a CONVENTIONAL story)
* The Twilight Kingdom
* Faith Stealer
* The Last
* Caerdroia (for what it's worth, this is where I feel things start to mostly pick up again for Eight in the pre-8DA era; there are some messy or dull stories left, but this in particular is a fantastic story that McGann and company really dig into, and the slump is solidly over)
* The Next Life
* Terror Firma
* Scaredy Cat
* Other Lives
* Time Works
* Something Inside
* Memory Lane
* Absolution
* The Girl Who Never Was (at this point, Charley's timeline gets complicated; her story, uh, goes elsewhere... I don't want to spoil anything, so I'd just say that if you reach this point and want to know what happens to her, PM me instead of looking it up and I'll give you her timeline following this story; it'd be too easy to spoil yourself here!)
* The Company of Friends (these stories land all the fuck over the place during Eight's timeline, and I'm not inclined to sort them back in, haha; placing it here works well anyway both because it was released after the previous stories and because it's kind of an overview of his past up to this point, including some comic-strip companions who haven't been detailed in the audios)

The Eighth Doctor Adventures range begins here:

* Blood of the Daleks, parts 1 and 2
* Horror of Glam Rock
* Immortal Beloved
* Phobos
* No More Lies
* Human Resources parts 1 and 2
* Dead London
* Max Warp
* Brave New Town
* The Skull of Sobek
* Grand Theft Cosmos
* The Zygon Who Fell to Earth
* Sisters of the Flame
* Vengeance of Morbius
* Orbis
* Hothouse
* The Beast of Orlok
* Wirrn Dawn
* The Scapegoat
* The Cannibalists
* The Eight Truths
* Worldwide Web
* Death in Blackpool
* Situation Vacant
* Nevermore
* The Book of Kells
* Deimos
* The Resurrection of Mars
* Relative Dimensions
* Prisoner of the Sun
* Lucie Miller
* To the Death

Here we switch over from the 8DA series to Eighth Doctor boxsets. Story and character threads pick up pretty directly from the 8DAs.

* Dark Eyes (The Great War, Fugitives, Tangled Web, 'X' and the Daleks)
* Dark Eyes II (The Traitor, The White Room, Time's Horizon, Eyes of the Master)
* Dark Eyes III (The Death of Hope, The Reviled, Masterplan, Rule of the Eminence)
* Dark Eyes IV (A Life in the Day, The Monster of Montmartre, Master of the Daleks, Eye of Darkness)
* Doom Coalition (released this October, stories titled The Eleven, The Red Lady, The Galileo Trap, The Red Mill)
* Doom Coalition II-IV (Release dates TBA, but they range into 2017; all story titles from here on out unannounced as of yet)",null,0,null,1436619457,null,0,1436621137,1,csznjvc,null,t3_3cq2pp,null,t1_csznjvc,null,t1_csyj1wk,null,null,null,1440486388,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

The main point is that we need to teach that critcising islam is not some personal attack on their character which they seem to think it is, claiming islamophobia is just a way of shutting down open debate about harmful beliefs.

null,false,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"There are two kinds of Tax Credit.

The one described above is Tax Relief which is applied to an individual's tax bill. You apply for the credit at the end of the tax year and it's deducted from your tax bill. I'm not 100% clear, but I'm guessing such a credit isn't necessary in this country because we have the Personal Allowance - the £10,600 you can earn before beginning to pay tax. I think I'm right by making the example that if we *didn't* have a tax-free Personal Allowance, instead having this form of Tax Credit, we would all have to fill in a form declaring our income for the year in order to get the lump sum refund once a year. It's a credit we would have to claim back out of tax we'd already paid to HMRC.

CTC and WTC are different. They're a state benefit, means tested and handled by HMRC. They're not linked to how much tax you've paid into the system at all, they're calculated based on circumstance and income and they're recalculated annually based on the previous tax year's income and any change in circumstance, which you declare each April.

I can see why you'd be confused, but they're not the same thing, and Tax Credits **are** a state benefit.",null,0,null,1436620139,null,0,1436620984,0,csznrco,null,t3_3cwi9k,null,t1_csznrco,null,t3_3cwi9k,null,null,null,1437768847,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I figure eventually the message might get back to head office that bugging people at their homes might not be the best idea, regardless of the good work your charity does.  I'm an average person, I do not wish harm upon dogs and cats, children or whatever it is your charity supports but I have enough direct debits already and can barely pay them some times.

In fact, even if every lib dem who renegged had just abstained from voting, it would not have passed. The lib dems absolutely knew their votes were vital in changing the outcome, which is the only reason they changed their stance on the issue.

Actually, it's you who's objectively... wrong.

1) Most Lib Dems did not vote for the tuition fee hike - they either voted against or abstained.

2) Of those who did vote, although slightly more voted for than voted against, this was only a difference of 7 which would not have made any difference either way.

3) If you look at the vote totals excluding the Lib Dems, 297 Conservatives voted for the rise, and if you add together every other party who voted against the rise, including the 6 Conservative rebels, it still only adds to 283.  So even if every Lib Dem had abstained, the measure would still have passed.

- They said about the Liberal party under Gladstone when they supported Irish home rule but they managed to reinvent themselves and win a landslide victory at the start of the 20th Century.

- They said the same when the Liberal party brought us into the war, but they recovered and managed to push a members bills legalised abortion and homosexuality in the 60s

- They said the same about Labour in the 30s when they went into coalition with the Conservatives and inflicted cruel spending cuts but they managed to rebrand themselves and form the greatest government this country has ever seen post-war.

- They said the same when Labour became excessively left-wing in the 1980s but they managed to win the most spectacular election in 1996.

In short Conservatism, Liberalism, and Socialism have been part of the English tradition since the civil war. Individual parties might suffer blows but ideas never will.

So, in a lot of states minimum wage is less than it is here, and even then many jobs in service type industries aren't subject to a minimum wage, hence the reliance on tipping. 

Of course you could argue that it is offset by a lower cost of living, particularly housing costs in many areas. However healthcare costs can be crippling.

haha, I've never heard of that! You sometimes get paid more if you work more than your contracted hours (i.e. overtime) but if anything the working time directive acts to cut the amount of overtime you *can* do, if you haven't signed the waiver its illegal for you to go over 48 hours. If the working time directive was scrapped we'd still have overtime, and possibly more of it!

And honestly, I think do think if you *want* to work more than 48 hours a week, you should be allowed to, there should be an opt-out! I mean most people in salaried jobs will have worked more than 48 hours a week at one point or another. I'm on about 60 at the moment, but I really enjoy my job and I really want to get a project finished, so I actually don't care, however under the working time directive my employer are actually breaking the law by allowing me to do this!

You're right that nobody is *forced* but the point of this law is to protect the vulnerable from being harassed or coerced into doing it. 

For dodgy charities it's difficult to be specific because you could face legal, regardless if you're right or not, by commenting so it's difficult to cite sources. 

For employment I mean that there are charities out there who have a CEO, for example, who benefits from a very nice salary but the charity does very little.

null,false,PhysS,cnty-wales,English Liberal in Wales,null,"&gt;closing our deficit is pretty important to maintain confidence in our system and thus reduce interest payments on our bonds

Yes because Japan, with a debt load of 226%, pays the most ridiculous interest rates on its bonds, a whopping 0.44% for a ten year bond. Compare that to our 80% and 2% respectively. Also, interest payments haven't really been a problem since the war despite the fact we have had a deficit for most of that time. It seems the investor confidence is not so closely correlated with deficits then. Also I am a liberal, I actually believe in free markets and am not an anti-capitalist.

&gt;Yep they're all election winners, I think Osborne has done far worse though over the past 5 years.

The fact those policies where election winners does not make them right morally or economically and does not make this budget left wing. Also the fact Osborne has does worse before doesn't make this good. 

&gt;So you think the government should subsidise employers that don't pay their workers enough? Interesting how people on the left complained when they were introduced and complain when they're cut

Once again, I am a liberal and not on the left. Economic studies have shown that tax-credits are one of the most cost-effective policies at reducing inequality. I dislike the idea that we as a society must top up peoples's wages but they are unskilled and their labour not worth as much due to automation. There are two scenarios for wages, low wage and low prices (our current scheme) and high wages and high prices. The second scenario was an alternative but automation now threatens the high wage part such that it just isn't valid anymore.",null,0,null,1436622920,null,0,false,0,cszopgm,null,t3_3cwju1,null,t1_cszopgm,null,t1_cszo6ig,null,null,null,1440486343,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

I think that our fans aren't helping the situation with the anger they are directing at Sterling, even though he is at fault for it.
 I find that the most disappointing, as we have basically helped with forcing him out the door rather than trying to show him sense and get someone, with the potential to be brilliant, see why he should stay.

Another thing that bugs me is how much we are eating up the press coverage, when all they are trying to do is stir up a hornets nest to get more clicks and more newspaper sales.
Sure hes fucked up and not conducted himself professionally, but at 20 years old who the fuck does?... regardless of the money you earn!

Lets face it Sterling doesn't seem to be a genius, maybe he's quite gullible, and when you have trusted your career to a snake like Aidy Ward, who is more interested in using you as a Pawn to make lots of money and launch an Agency business, then maybe we shouldn't be aiming our anger at just him. 

Aidy Ward wants his flag ship signing to do a multimillion dollar move to a big team with the sole intention of advertising Aidy Wards Agency, even if it means longterm, Steling as a player will suffer as a result, because short term it will get more potential stars on the books. 

I can seriously see this costing Sterling's career progression (1st team to Squad player) if City decide to throw some money about next season and look abroad, not to mention the damage that has already been done to his reputation. 

We would forgive and forget if he stayed and succeeded, aka Suarez and Gerrard (although they were better than Sterling currently is) but it just seems unobtainable now.

________________________________________

TLDR: I wish we had cut him more slack for fucking up and tried to make him see sense and feel appreciated to stay; rather than burning effigies and assisting in his departure with a mob mentality.... or maybe I'm just an optimist.

Not necessarily, they just had to rebrand themselves and think about ends rather than means. 'New Liberals' Such as Lloyd-George and Beveridge thought the best way to ensure personal freedom would be to slay the giants of squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease. They maintained their principles by for example diminishing the power of the house of lords.

Tony Blair as well went to great lengths in his years as an opposition leader to show how his project was a continuity of the Gaskelite tradition in his party. There's a more recent book called 'Speak for Britain!' by Martin Pugh that traces this back but Labour were always ready to compromise their socialism with practicality eg by cooperating with the Americans over NATO and by scrapping  free prescriptions. Blair was able to implement a lot of things that were in the 83 manifesto because of this - eg freedom of information act, devolution, sure start centres.

Every single lib dem who was elected promised to vote against, and most of them didn't. Moreover the sitting party leadership voted for the increase, Clegg whipped his party enough to be able to pass. 

&gt;Of those who did vote, although slightly more voted for than voted against, this was only a difference of 7 which would not have made any difference either way.

What? that's bizarre, of course it made a difference. 

&gt;) If you look at the vote totals excluding the Lib Dems, 297 Conservatives voted for the rise, and if you add together every other party who voted against the rise, including the 6 Conservative rebels, it still only adds to 283. So even if every Lib Dem had abstained, the measure would still have passed.

Stop pulling things out of your arse, [the vote was 323 to 302.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11952449). Here's the record for the day if you don't believe the bbc: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmvote/101209v01.htm , ctrl f education. 

Saying  ""So even if every Lib Dem had abstained, the measure would still have passed."" is stupid, because it would never have happened. It's like saying ""if labor decided to merge into the conservatives the vote would still have passed"", you're talking about situations that would never actually happen. 

The lib dems who changed their mind and voted for rather than against are the people who swung the vote. If they'd voted against it wouldn't have gone through, if they'd abstained it wouldn't have gone through, but because clegg whipped them to vote for, they voted for and it went through.

Huge amounts of that debt is owned by ordinary people who see it as a safe haven for their money and a contribution to their society.

In reality interest rates on bonds are more affected by monetary factors (such as inflation and bank interest rates) than fiscal factors such as the deficit. 

&gt;The conservative stance on closing the deficit and committing to reducing the debt when times are good is exactly the sort of prudent forward planning that Gordon Brown claimed when he became chancellor. Reducing the debt when the economy is healthy means you actually have scope to borrow and spend when recessions hit.

Such an idea is not conservative and is instead the fundamental maxim of Keynesian economics, the economics of the left. What I'm arguing is that a surplus is not actually necessary, a deficit is perfectly fine as long as it isn't ridiculous, as growth will lower the debt load and the burden of payments. You can reach the start of the next crisis with a smaller debt burden than when you left the last crisis without ever getting a surplus. That's what we did for most of the post-war years.

We all know Poch's tendency to utilize youth players and I can see that exactly happening with our CMs.

**Bentaleb** is a no brainer. He's the heart and soul of the center of our midfield and should start as many games as possible.

I feel people are dismissing **Mason** too early already. For someone who was on loan at League One, to make the leap into PL football and fit in almost seamlessly is pretty amazing. He's not that young at 24 but it doesn't mean he won't improve. Not to say the criticism against him wasn't warranted, but to say that we shouldn't use him and leave him out of our ""Bentaleb's midfield partner"" discussions is a bit silly and rash. He may turn out to not improve by that much, but at worse he'll still remain as a useful/reliable squad player. And considering how patient he's been this whole time, we should at least keep him longer despite his relatively lackluster second half.

If there was one player I think would be sold, it would be **Dembele**, and logically it would make sense. At 27 he could still fetch a relatively decent price and he deserves to be in a team which can utilize his very specific skillsets to its full potential. His talents are wasted here. He's great at holding up the ball, but his first instinct is to dribble, instead of look up and pass. He does decently when he's on, but any other of our CMs could probably perform just as well in his position, not that he's *that* bad but rather he doesn't fit well into the type of midfielder Poch wants.

Haven't seen too many Swansea games to evaluate but there are pretty good things to be heard from their fans about **Carroll**. I think it'll come down to the pre-season evaluation/training and the first half of the season. If he isn't a good fit/can't adapt, then he can be sold off in January or the following transfer window. Regardless, I'd like to see him be given a shot at the first team before we jump to conclusions.

The interesting player to talk about is **Alli**. I admit that I did not see a single MK Dons match last season, but to be League One YPOTY is pretty impressive. He's obviously a very attack-minded CM, scoring 16 goals and grabbing 9 assists. Apparently he's a very well-rounded CM, and at such a young age it can be only a good thing because it leaves plenty of time and development for Poch is use him as he thinks best. If it were any other young player, a loan to a Championship side or Lower PL team would be the most logical, but in light of the recent comments by Alli himself and how he performed last season, even that sentiment is up for debate.

Whatever the course of action is, I think I'll leave it to our head coach to work with transfers and midfielders because, at the end of the day, what the fuck do I know.",null,0,null,1436627399,null,0,false,0,cszqgv9,null,t3_3cwxz7,null,t1_cszqgv9,null,t3_3cwxz7,null,null,null,1437770958,null,17,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,17,null

**Pulis &amp; Pardew**

-

With Palace up, they had to try and stay there for the first time since the First Division became the Premier League. Heavily favoured to go down and with main striker Glenn Murray sidelined with a cruciate ligament injury sustained in the playoffs, Holloway invested in an assortment of low-cost transfers to try and bolster his squad. The likes of Jerome Thomas, Elliot Grandin, Florian Marange, Jimmy Kebe and Stephen Dobbie never amounted to much, sadly, and Palace started horribly when the team collected only three points from their opening ten fixtures. Holloway left after eight games, a mutual agreement with the owners, and Palace’s form began to recover. A morale boosting away win over Hull was overseen by caretaker manager Keith Millen, right before the new man took the reins.

Tony Pulis was a gruff Welshman who cut his Premier League teeth with Stoke City, a small town club who he rebuilt with investment from his chairman Peter Coates and took up to the Premier League. He quickly won plaudits for overachieving with his side and keeping them in the Prem, but equally made many enemies, not least Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, for their combative style of play. In the May of 2013, Pulis left his club by mutual consent, and quickly became an attractive prospect for the clubs circling the Premier League drain. Palace managed to snag Pulis, and suddenly triggered an amazing run of games. Between the start of December and the end of the season on the 11th of May, Palace picked up 38 points, turning in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in Premier League history and finishing 11th. Pivotal were club captain Mile Jedinak and long-serving goalkeeper Julian Speroni as Palace defied expectations, and most memorably delivered the final blow to Liverpool’s title hopes in the now infamous Crystanbul match at Selhurst Park where Liverpool’s pushing to improve their goal difference at 3-0 up cost them dearly as Palace roared their way back to a draw.

But cowpats and the Devil’s herd, remember? A few days before the start of the season, with last season’s success signings Jason Puncheon, Marouane Chamakh, Scott Dann and Joe Ledley properly bedded in, Tony Pulis walked out on the club. The reasons for why have never been made truly clear, but it’s commonly accepted that the board wouldn’t allow the spiky Welshman to spend the club’s transfer budget on who he wanted, and so Pulis left the club in the lurch. Completely wrongfooted, Palace began the season in full-blown crisis, and the board made the cardinal sin of being neither hasty nor choosing a manager thoroughly. In August, Colin Wanker made his grand return to the sound of groans from the Holmesdale. For followers of Palace’s history, this turn of events did not come as that much of a surprise.

Palace had a lot of bad luck, but also a lot of poor play. Form slowly declined, and the straw that broke the camel’s back came in a 1-3 home loss to Southampton. As the third goal went in, the unthinkable happened, and the Selhurst Park crowd ,which had backed its team through thick and thin, went silent. Few managers ever fully lose the support of the Selhurst Park crowd, but the appalling play and the memory of the man who had so quickly jumped ship in the club’s darkest moments led to the fans losing their voice. Warnock was sacked a day later.

Then the board made amends. On the 2nd of January, club icon Alan Pardew was appointed, invoking memories of his game-winning header all those years ago against Liverpool. Pardew had been locked in a poisonous atmosphere at his previous club Newcastle United, where a brilliant 2011-12 season had seen the club finish 5th. This elation soon wore off, however, as star players were sold and not replaced by stingy owner Mike Ashley, and Pardew struggled to get the most out of his squad in the face of widespread and vocal fan criticism. Worn out by battling his own boardroom and fans as well as opposition in the Premier League, Pardew jumped at the chance to manage his old club, to the relief of literally every side affected.

It wasn’t only Pardew returning, either. Prodigal son Wilfried Zaha, who had left Palace to seek his fortune at Manchester United, returned a broken bird lacking in confidence and with a badly shaken belief in himself. As soon as Pardew stepped through the doors at Selhurst Park, things began to right themselves, with Zaha slowly but surely turning back into the dangerous winger of old. Notably, new signing James McArthur took to the squad like a duck to water, and previously-inconsistent winger Yannick Bolasie found some consistency to turn into one of the most dangerous players in the Premiership. Most heartening to see, however, was the return of Glenn Murray, a player who had fought all his life to get into the Premier League only to have injury curtail his dreams. Suddenly, under Pardew, Murray regained his confidence and form in a matter of weeks, becoming a huge battering ram of a forward up front. Jason Puncheon moved inside to play behind him, and once again Palace were hitting serious late season form. Notable wins over relegation rivals turned into famous victories over top-table opposition, and Palace ended up finishing 10th: their highest ever Premier League finish.

So what now for Palace? Well, history dictates we've only got limited time at these heights. Palace are the classic yo-yo club, after all. But with these new owners, a talented young team and a manager who loves being here, perhaps for once we might actually make something long term of this. Perhaps Palace will be in the Prem to stay. Perhaps our Palace - our yo-yoing, downtrodden, hard-luck, ridiculous, homely, poxy, meagre, ramshackle, *amazing* Crystal Palace - will do even better, and frankly at this moment in time, who's to say we won't? After all, we are the pride of South London, South London's number one...

First of all it helped because my advisor stopped pushing these working courses on me, because I was doing it on my own - a job I found fairly ok.

Secondly you'd be surprised how often recruiters are impressed when you do voluntary work off your own back instead of the jobseekers imposed one.

I dont think you could get anywhere by complaining tbh.

I dont get this line, tho, the placements are at the advisors discretion, if they think you'd benefit from it, theyd place you on it, and I know if youve been claiming for x amount you get forwarded to one as well.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"Hundreds a week? People pay hundreds a week for an apartment and it certainly doesn't come with hired help. Hundreds a week is just basic food, bills and accommodation costs, that will at least come to £200-300 a week, and that is if you are just a normal person going about your life. A minimum wage carer costs £250 a week, for 5 days, at 8 hours a day, so you are at least going to need two for full time care, that is £500 a week to provide care 10.7 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Hundreds a week is pittance for full time care, if someone needs care for the hours they are awake, i.e. two 8 hour shifts a day, 16 hours, 7 days a week, that is £728 at minimum wage, for every pound extra those carers make an hour, that is another £5824 a year in costs, and lets face it £7.50 an hour is still a poor wage, you can get that in retail. This is completely ignoring, food, accommodation, heat, transport, literally every other cost. On carers alone, for 16 hours a day 7 days a week that is £38,000, you have to share those carers with 2 other people to just get the caring costs below the minimum wage salary per year, 3 other people to get them below £10K a year.

With the older population and great life expectancy, caring costs are only going to get higher, if you live for 10 years with part time care, that could easily cost you £50K, that isn't much if you have been working a managerial office job for 30 years, but lots of people make less than £15K-20K a year their whole lives and essentially have no relevant savings.

Facts are if you want to pay people a reasonable wage for caring, say £9 an hour, which is around £18500 a year, for full time care 1 on 1 that is £52K a year, very few can afford that, very few can afford half that.

I don't see it as reducing to someones character (gender isn't a character) or predicting area's of risk, I see it as an issue to tackle, both for men in general and muslim men for whatever the cause is there.

The Ottoman Empire didn't collapse because Islam, in fact Islamic principles held the state together longer than it would have under Christianity, as whilst Christianity was holding the principle of burning heathens at the stake, Islamic principles on heathens were simply heavy taxation.

It was the rise of nationalism in Europe, various interventions (particularly from Russia who, true to their nature, stirred up the separatists), and having someone genuinely insane as the sultan that led to the Ottoman Empire spiralling out of control in the 19th century.
