I think these myths are largely a waste of time (and I think that Privatisation hasn't been good for the railways, so it says something about the 'myths')

* Myth 1: Nobody is suggesting passenger growth is caused by privatisation
* Myth 2: That there has been private investment should be a good thing (it may not be as large as some claim) - we may have contributed the same amount if it hasn't been privatised resulting in Â£150m less investment 
* Myth 3: The cost to the passenger has very little to do with the train companies.  The government tells them how much they can raise tickets by and then they bid for the franchises based on that.  The government could tell them all that the price of a ticket is going to be Â£0 and then the bids would all involve us paying the franchises, not the other way around.

There is a ton of pros of having the field share. Revenue chief among them as there is no denying the NFL makes money. More marketing to an American crowd who will have connections to our team through the stadium share. Also, the NFL will not want the team to fail so they will do everything they can to make it work. Including providing funds for a state of the art stadium. 

The cons. It's a spectacle that I do not want to be apart of. Personally, after years of dealing with the NFL I am jaded to its business practices, its players on and off the field and the general presentation of the sport. I often convert friends to European football by hitting them with this quote ""90 minutes, no commercials"". The NFL is a giant beer and car commercial with 22 players every now and again getting a 10 second play off. It's not the beautiful game. It's an ugly game.

I know of a rifle shooting range that was built on a multi-sport site. There was a low level of local resistance, but it was a small range that used subsonic ammunition, so really not very noisy and it got it's planning permission.

Range was built, and the centre received it's first angry call about the noise pollution. Thing was, the range was built but the target system hadn't been installed, and the Safety Certificate hadn't yet been issued. The first shot hadn't been fired yet!

Transpired that the hockey club on the pitch next door (which has been there for 30 years) had been doing drills and smacking their hard plastic balls against one of the wooden pitchside hoardings for about two hours that Saturday afternoon. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. Continuously. Not surprised they were upset by the noise!

 In almost 15 years of watching Liverpool I've rarely seen a player as devastating as Raheem playing the no. 10 in the diamond 2 seasons ago.  That kind of pace running out of midfield is a nightmare for defenders.  It's not just his pace either.  His passing, awareness, pressing, strength/balance (for his size), and crossing are all top notch.

Firmino categorically is not an improvement despite what people want to believe.  He had 7 league goals last season the majority of which were tap ins.  He is a good player but lacks Sterling's natural talent and experience in the PL.  He is not really better than Sterling in a single facet of the game.

Do you understand *why* the debt wasn't paid off? This is a key idea in economics: opportunity cost.

The Marshall Plan aid and debt incurred by the UK to the US was at an interest rate below inflation. That means that the UK is better off letting the debt inflate away rather than paying it off--that is, paying the interest on the debt and paying as little as possible is better than paying off the debt because the *real* value of the debt ends up decreasing.

If you ever see a debt-ridden person on a personal finance website asking for help, the advice is always the same: pay off the high-interest debt first. The reason the US debt stuck around is precisely because it made no sense to pay it back--there were much, much more productive things the UK could do with the money.

Claiming the US debt is indicative of war profiteering belies more ignorance of economics. When debt is extended at lower-than-inflation interest rates, the issuer of that debt *loses*  money--the amount to be repaid shrinks due to inflation by a greater amount than the interest paid is worth.",null,0,null,1435071380,null,0,1435081824,0,csfxpvn,null,t3_3ar7u1,null,t1_csfxpvn,null,t1_csfr0m2,null,null,null,1437284812,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

However, it wasn't until I went elsewhere that I truly appreciated how terrible the treatment of disability at Cambridge is. During my post-graduate years my current university has been enormously helpful, organized and efficient. They have never once wasted hours of my time for no apparent benefit. Furthermore, I have never experienced discrimination from teaching staff here.

These are issues Cambridge urgently needs to address but sadly the DRC has very, very little power or agency within the university to do so. The only way things will change is with pressure from university students themselves.

From a medical perspective, this makes a LOT more sense. People don't come to the A&amp;E when they should because they're scared of being booked by the police, even though we can't report that you're on drugs if you come to us (unless you literally have them on your person at the time). 

#*PRO TIP FROM A MEDICAL PRO:*

If you or a friend has overdosed on illicit drugs, don't worry about the police! 

**So long as you do not have drugs in your possession at the time of your admission,** we neither can nor will report you to the police. It is considered confidential under medical privilege, and you are absolutely safe from being prosecuted. 

Doctors, nurses and other medical staff are only obligated to report you if you may pose a threat to yourself or others. This includes if you are carrying a weapon such as a knife or gun, if you are in possession of illegal drugs (and even then, a lot of discretion is available so long as we think you won't hurt yourself or others immediately) at the time of admission, or a few other things like stating that you are dangerously suicidal or violent. Under those circumstances, we either have to restrain you for psychiatric/suicide watch holding, or in rare cases report it to either the police, or a relevant authority who is NOT the police.

**Medical staff will try to keep the police out of the equation for as long as legally possible!** We want people to keep coming to us, and that's hard to do if we report people!",null,0,null,1435071860,null,0,false,0,csfy06x,null,t3_3atc3p,null,t1_csfy06x,null,t3_3atc3p,null,null,null,1437285031,null,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36,null

A better explanation. Have a look at your keyboard, and I bet it is a QWERTY set up (top left letter on the top letter line). IIRC every English speaking country uses the QWERTY set up, with other countries having minor changes (Germany uses QWERTZ, for example). 

You would think if there was a *better* keyboard design, one that let its users type faster, it would be an automatic include in new laptops, right? I mean, who wouldn't want to type faster just because of a different key layout!

In fact, there are more efficient layouts. Check out [DVORAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) for an example, which IIRC has shown to produce faster typing consistently. But why don't we use it?

Because when keyboards were just starting out, the company that used QWERTY won the competition race by getting their typewriter in more businesses. At this point, even though DVORAK was more efficient, it was easier for businesses to have a QWERTY trained employee than re-train a DVORAK employee.

So while society as a whole would have benefited collectively from hours (if not years) of saved typing time, the individual companies didn't want to take on the burden of re-training. Thus QWERTY stuck. 

The UK government is similar. It works (British society has not collapsed yet!), but due to each decision in its formation being taken only in its own contained context, it has created a system that is inefficient as a whole. The Monarchy is a part of this. No one would include it if they were designing a system from the ground up (which many have, in fact, and no one has as of now). And even if it is not the most pressing issues (whataboutism can go eat a log), it is an inefficiency that deserves to be brought to attention and potentially set on a path of reform.

The recipient has 18 days to pay.  If they don't then the item is returned to the sender, if they can be identified.

So at this point it's likely your parcel is sat somewhere in Brighton.  It's possible that the mail room at the RN know there is an underpaid item but they may well have a policy of not collecting such items.

Rudiger, I personally prefer to Stones, because we'd have to heavily overpay for Stones because he's English and Everton don't need to sell, in comparison to a team that just fought off relegation in Stuttgart, and their similar in terms of quality.

This part confused me. Is Auschwitz littered with holocaust artefacts  on the ground? I remember visiting Dachau and the place was largely buildings surrounded by a gravel yard, with all of the artefacts and museum pieces kept inside. Has Auschwitz gone for a more 'alive' approach and kept the camp in the condition it was during the war?

You'd think that stealing buttons and pieces of glass found on the ground would be more common, unless it was some cordoned off exhibit. I'd be interested in knowing what was specifically stolen and from where.

Obviously theft, especially from a place such as Auschwitz is inexcusable, but walking around and finding a button and broken glass on the floor seems a bit different than theft of the plotter theft 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign in 2010, by comparison.

He is much more useful than Henderson is, I can't think of anyone who has the quality Fellaini has, how weird it may be it works for him. Also Fellaini was a huge part of why United finished top 4, it's not a coincidence that when Fellaini started playing United were playing the best football they had done all season. You can see how important he is vs top teams like Liverpool, Spurs and City where he completly and utterly dominated Toure the entire match and scored. Fellaini scored when United needed him the most, he scored the equalizer vs West Brom, he scored the 2-1 vs City and he scored the 2-1 vs Palace which was the match that won United the top 4.

Fellaini has shown how important he is both for the clubs he has played for and for his national team. Meanwhile Henderson has been meh at best for England. 

It does not matter if Fellaini is only good because of his size, he uses it  wonderfully and that is what matters. It is a strange quality which many managers don't know how to deal with.

What do you want to do? Sue them? Will some money make up for a sleepless night? The deed is done, it's happened. You can't make it undone.

Assuming it's a one-off, then you make a note of the time/date and move on with your life. It's one of those things. I've lived within earshot of a football stadium before, and when they host stadium gigs outside of football season, you can hear that music thumping through double glazing, and it's affecting *thousands* of homes. It's frustrating but you deal with it. I'll grant that even the late running ones don't go past 11 usually, but still not good if you have work in the morning.

If it becomes a regular occurrence - especially over the summer, then you involve the relevant authorities with your noise diary, get Police Crime numbers, etc.

Sorry for answering your question, but that's the answer! You asked ""what can I do?"" and the answer is make a note of the disturbance. You could have gone and knocked on the door, but *after the fact* there is nothing more you can do unless it becomes a regular problem. It happened, and that's it. Sorry if you don't like the answer, but that's not my problem - try writing to your MP and getting a new law passed!

I quite like the B Clean and have already purchased a back up, it seems very gentle and suited to most skin types. It is thicker and does take a little longer to 'melt down' to oil than the other melting gel cleansers I have tried (they all have a plant oil base). When all done my skin is squeaky clean without being tight or stripped.

I melt blobs slightly in the hands, roughly smooth them on to my face/ neck/ decollete so the product is in contact with body heat, *then leave for a minute or two before starting massaging.* By that point it will just feel like regular oil not a thick gel any more. As someone noted on another thread melting gels can drag on the skin if you don't wait a little for them to actually melt. Obviously any dragging is not good for rosaceans.

My only 'criticism' is I miss the lovely fragrance of my other melting gel cleansers, but that was the whole point in choosing the B Clean!!

You could argue this is different because it's a full name but whatever, here it is: http://www.promis.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sun.jpg

Traditionally they'd only do the first word, as in these two examples from other newspapers:

http://campiam.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Daily-Sun-article_9April13_0001.jpg

But as the first example I linked shows, exeptions are made for when the first word is a singleton letter (or possibly for all prepositions, I'm not sure), and perhaps also for full names.


This may stem from something I've seen in a lot of proper newspapers, where an article will start with the location where the story happened in all caps.

I personally think Borini could have easily done the same job were it not for a feud with the Rodgers.

Raheem's passing was ok but his decision-making this season was so laborious and he'd often miss the window for a killer pass through dilly-dallying and indecision. The same with Sturridge when he played after January. And Coutinho. They also both got pushed off the ball so much more easily than 13/14. Watch some highlights from back then and look how hard those little nippers fought back against CBs a foot taller.

The partnership they both had with Suarez made them play so much better in 13/14. The whole team, not just Strurridge and Sterling, even Coutinho, immediately looked more ponderous and selfish without him, ignoring good runs and passes for another shimmy and another crap-shot, or a pass back to midfield/defence!

I think Hart needs to mature and improve a bit first before getting an promising understudy. The threat of Pants and Willy have both shown to make him a better keeper. 

Willy is proven to be good goalkeeper, so I am sure that his mistakes are solely due to lack of match practice. Willy is also older and more experienced, which (for Joe) means more competition and better players to train with and learn from. 

If Hart's only competition is a young understudy, I think he would play worse and learn less. I think Joe has improved a lot this season and I don't think it's just good form. I think it has a lot to do with Willy. I don't know if Willy will stay, but he's been a model professional, so I would be happy if he did.

A decade later, financial deregulation allowed them to bet their clients money on things instead, and things got worse from their. Fast forward to Reagan and thatchers deregulation allowing the derivative market to take off, based on graduates from the Ivy League writing complex mathematics in order that legislators would not understand and wouldn't be able to make them illegal. They succeeded, and this was a major factor in causing 2008. Moreover, in 1999, Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney merged in what should have been illegal due to a separation of interests. The Glass-Steagel act, which had been working very well since the '30s, was declared to be now irrelevant by Clinton, with his Financial Services Modernisation Act, due to shitty advice from Reaganite advisors who stuck around, contrary to the sound advice of his Labour Secretary, Robert Reich. All this together has lead to a modern financial sector that makes the economy less stable and sucks money upwards while providing no real benefit to the economy as a whole.

Ivanovic - 10m, John Terry - free, Cahill - 7m, Dave - 7m. The truth is that Wenger refused to take gambles on players even for not that much money.

The reason the debt excuse mainly doesn't sit well with me is because  Arsenal not only kept qualifying for the CL earning CL money. Arsenal weren't spending money because your owners wanted to see profits, not 
""clear the debt"". You don't even have to pay off the debt until 2030 for something anyways. You only had to contribute like 20m a year towards it, but you were easily making up that revenue in ticket sales from the extra seating in your new stadium.

2. Pint on average about Â£3/Â£3.50 I'd say
3. Bingo, on this sub foreigners seem to think NI is a hell hole but as long as you don't go looking for trouble and avoid topic like religion or politics and respect queuing you'll be fine.
4. The Ulster museum has some but it is pretty merger right now, the issues of presentation of the troubles is a massive academic debate right now but there are some good museums in Londonderry (as well as some truly awful ones) plenty of brill books on the topic.
5. Don't be offended easily, if you become accepted by people they will take the piss out of you. (It means you are liked) Our humour is very sarcastic and negative.
6. Not really, our touristy stuff isn't that touristy, it is actually pretty great, our tourist industry is based on the Titanic and Game of Thrones. Titanic is pretty touristy so avoid the Titanic Museum but our nature tourism is great.  

Finally, welcome to NI, it is a great country, very friendly and welcoming. If your living in the student area guessing you are coming for study? There is an area in the student area called ""the Holy Lands"" which is pretty trashy during the term time which is best to be avoided :)

When it comes to social life at RHUL some people love it or hate it I find. I think those who want different things to do all the time, and new places to go struggle a little with the concept that this is not a university placed in a city. The uni itself is tucked away in a small town (which I'm sure you already knew), so for the most part there isn't a lot of variety on offer. Personally, I found there was more than enough to keep me entertained but can understand why others don't. Despite that, probably the basics to know are:

- Staines which is one stop via train, or 10/15 minutes by Bus has a cinema, a lot of restaurants and a decent amount of shops to do some shopping. There's some decent pubs in Staines too, although be warned that the bus/train services around these areas stop quite early so if you want to go out late be prepared to get a taxi (Probably about Â£10-15 at night- so between 6 isn't that bad).

- You won't find Egham High Street that useful except for food shopping/hairdressers- although I think most people tend to do their food shopping online. Egham has some nice pubs- The Crown is probably the most popular one and it serves good food, but Bar163 is also very good although a bit expensive.

- Englefield Green is a small village up the hill from campus and has quite a few pubs that students go to (Happy Man, Barley Mow, The Armstrong Gun etc.) and is basically where the majority of students live after living their first year in Halls (and has been my home for the last three years!). 

- Campus will probably be where you go most often for a nights out. The SU is on Fridays/Wednesdays (til 3am) and Medicine is open til 2am on a Saturday. Monkey's Forehead across the road has a student deal night on Mondays which a lot of people go to. Sometimes the Uni will organise coaches to a nearby town to go to clubs (e.g. Kingston, Guildford, sometimes into central London) so keep an eye out for them if you're interested in doing something like that. Unless you're willing to fork out a lot for a taxi back from these places, these will probably be your only chance to go somewhere else without being stranded.

- The other place people often go is Windsor to Liquid. I think Thursday is a student night but personally I hate clubbing and have been a few times and despised it. But it's quite popular with students.

-Virgina Water Lake is pretty nice to walk around if you fancy a bit of scenery and is a reasonable walking distance from the uni (it's also where the lake scenes in Harry Potter were filmed)

As for tips and tricks: Do not select Kingswood Halls. Those who live there typically wish they hadn't- it's a pretty hefty walk-20/25 minutes- (or otherwise wait for the bus) to get to campus and most feel they lose the benefits of the campus lifestyle we have here with most things being available/catered for on campus. That's not to say that Kingswood is all bad but I think in general its accepted that the other halls of residence are better.

Best Halls are Williamson/Tuke/Butler and a few others but I forget the names- double bedrooms with en-suites and you share a kitchen with 8 others. The kitchen is large enough to invite quite a few people over without getting too much in other people's way. However, they are the most expensive (naturally)- so if you can't afford to live in one, make sure to get to know people who do so you can get invited to those pre-drink sessions and parties (although in general they're supposedly 'not allowed').

The only other tip I can suggest is to sign up for psychology studies. We normally try to encourage students to sign up to our mailing list during freshers fair. Most studies take only 30-60 minutes and you can make Â£5-10 easy. Some pay more than that. I  took part in an fMRI study and got Â£30 and picture of my brain. Pretty cool if you ask me! But yeah- look out for our studies and you should be able to boost a little bit of extra income for yourself for just a few hours work a term :) If you want something more of a real PT job then the uni offers quite a few to students but try to look early to make sure you get the best chance of getting them. Otherwise I think most work at Costa Coffee/Tesco/Pubs in Egham.

Anyway, I've rambled on a bit but I hope you get an idea. If you like Pubs, drinking with friends in halls/rented accomodation and just going to the SU/Medicine then you'll get on here just fine. If you're someone that needs more variety than that and like clubs, then you can try Windsor for Liquid and keep your eye out for coach journeys that the uni offer. Staines is your best bet for shopping/restaurants/cinema.

I realise most of that was centred around drinking... I guess you can sorta see what my undergrad life was like!",null,0,null,1435080994,null,0,1435081719,0,csg3vg4,null,t3_3atd50,null,t1_csg3vg4,null,t1_csg2hu8,null,null,null,1437289356,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Falls/Shankill are in West Belfast and are perfectly safe (read as safe as any other city) to visit. Shankill isn't a particularly large area, being a protestant/unionist enclave in largely catholic/nationalist West Belfast but it contrasts nicely with Mountpottinger in East Belfast. The residents in both areas have far more in common with each other than they would care to admit.

I'm principally against privatisation but at the time I think it was the only thing that would have kicked the railways forward. A lot more needs to be done, there is still some very old rolling stock that should not be operating and fares are far to high and complex but there has definitely been some good out of it.

I suspect a lot of people who say ""Bring back BR"" were very young when they travelled on it, if they ever did at all. It was awful!

This makes me happy, being in the countryside, I'm looking forward to a lot of strolls in the country, keep one thing common between home and university.

&gt; Best Halls are Williamson/Tuke/Butler and a few others but I forget the names- double bedrooms with en-suites and you share a kitchen with 8 others. The kitchen is large enough to invite quite a few people over without getting too much in other people's way. However, they are the most expensive (naturally)- so if you can't afford to live in one, make sure to get to know people who do so you can get invited to those pre-drink sessions and parties (although in general they're supposedly 'not allowed').

They were my number one choice! I really hope I get them, we had to rank our accommodation choices on our application, I had to put kingswood 3rd or 4th I think.

&gt; The only other tip I can suggest is to sign up for psychology studies. We normally try to encourage students to sign up to our mailing list during freshers fair. Most studies take only 30-60 minutes and you can make Â£5-10 easy. Some pay more than that. I took part in an fMRI study and got Â£30 and picture of my brain. Pretty cool if you ask me! But yeah- look out for our studies and you should be able to boost a little bit of extra income for yourself for just a few hours work a term :) If you want something more of a real PT job then the uni offers quite a few to students but try to look early to make sure you get the best chance of getting them. Otherwise I think most work at Costa Coffee/Tesco/Pubs in Egham.

Also super helpful, I'm looking for ways to earn money for some side hobbies and extra spending money.

&gt;Anyway, I've rambled on a bit but I hope you get an idea. If you like Pubs, drinking with friends in halls/rented accomodation and just going to the SU/Medicine then you'll get on here just fine. If you're someone that needs more variety than that and like clubs, then you can try Windsor for Liquid and keep your eye out for coach journeys that the uni offer. Staines is your best bet for shopping/restaurants/cinema.

No, you've been very kind to spend some time helping a future student. Perhaps if it's not your last year, I might see you around next year!

I'll admit that the commuter network in the South East was a national embarrassment but privatisation came right in the middle of its modernisation and delayed it by several years. The Chiltern and Great Western lines received new trains, track and signalling in the early 90s.

Outside London big investment had gone into new trains with new trains on the East coast and the class 15X series coming into service, still the backbone of our regional services.

&gt;has been solid defensively for us most of the time 

Most of the time? You make it sound like he's played a couple of seasons for us. He's played 10 games total, including cup matches.

&gt;and just binned off when we are clearly struggling at RB.

We've not been great at right back, I completely agree. So why hasn't he been playing? Obviously the coaches and manager feel, with us playing three centrebacks he wasn't attacking enough to play the right hand side version of what Moreno was doing on the left. Simply put, he's not a goal scoring/attacking threat so he doesn't fit the system.

He's only here on a two year loan, one that we probably won't continue for another year because we'll play possibly Clyne first choice with maybe Wisdom as backup.

With your first, any adjustments or repairs to systems like the brakes, gearbox and engine, and chain/sprocket changes might be best done with the help of an experienced engineer, after which you might consider a torque wrench, chain breaker, possibly bearing tools.

- Apply for 3 jobs a week and gain Â£54 per week 

not a lot for a week but the time required to apply for a job in relation to the amount paid is much higher than what most people earn in regular and even well paid jobs. 

It would take me about 20 minutes to apply to a retail job (20mins x 3 = 1hr x Â£54 = Â£54ph

They never check the emails or my applications, I used to show up and say I've done 20 this week. 

Basically I could send terrible CVs and emails and just stay on the system with ease (If I was a nob). 
I think that those claiming need to do at least 5 decent applications a day to be worthy of claiming. 

This is an allowance for those looking for work, not for bums who do the minimum at a poor rate. 
 
There need to be a performance driven system.
The more quality applications the more you earn
And you could prove it with transcripts of emails and receipt of applications (which often sent to your emails)

This would also hold those applying accountable to themselves and the JSA centres.

You go through hoops and it's a ball ache but hey your unemployed with a tonne of time on your hand anyways, suck it up if your truly serious about finding work then you won't be doing it for long.

By limiting the content on this sub, you will effectively guarantee it's dead for much of the offseason.

If you're looking for engaging content, try hosting subreddit watch parties/discussions. Each week have the community (or an esteemed member of the community) pick an episode for everyone to watch. Host a watch party for those who want to watch it at the same time, and host a thread for those who wish to talk about the episode. It's a great way to refresh on old content, make connections to new content and it gives us a good reason to frequent this sub in the offseason.

As a result there are ruined buildings and rubble all over the place where these kids could have picked stuff up from.

The USA is actually much better at assimilating foreigners than we are.

One of the reasons we are rich, is because we did so off the back of India and Africa. Many of our richest institutions were founded with that cash. 

We have a multi cultural system. Which seems fair enough after our wholesale exploitation of all of the places you mentioned. What that means is that we will tolerate other people's cultures as long as they are adding to the general good. And the vast majority of our immigrants are imo.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Firmino's an odd one. He's deployed as an attacking midfielder for Hoffenheim, but he and Kevin Volland (right winger) provide most of the goals for the team (both have scored 10 this season, Modeste and Shipplock both scored 9). He's got 32 goals and 28 assists in all competitions in the last 2 seasons though, so he's got an eye for goal, he likes to try cute tricks but he's also got an incredible work-rate. Personally as I've said in other threads, with his work-rate and appetite for goals there's no reason he can't turn into the next Suarez for us, but to be clear he's no where near that level yet. Wherever he plays, he'd be a brilliant asset for us.

Bacca is the definition of Fox in the box. If you were to watch all of his goals for Sevilla this season, he feeds on knock downs and generally is just efficient at getting the ball over the line. He's 28 years old and although he's not going to be able to bully defenders with his size or cause them nightmares with his dribbling, he links up with the midfield very well. It'd be harsh of me to say that Bacca is more a lucky striker than a talented one, because you have to be intelligent with your positioning across your career to get as many goals as Bacca does consistently (other than his 2009/2010 season with Brugge where he only played 10 times, Bacca has never scored less than 12 in a campaign), **but** I don't think he'd be afforded as many defensive mistakes in the premier league as he is in La Liga and his previous leagues.

Preventing the sell-off of council homes will limit supply? It's not 'their' home to buy, it's the state's, there specifically for people who can't afford to buy their own house.

Yet he's telling people that buying a house is better for them and that right to buy is better for society and the housing market as a whole. All he's saying is the government does know best - that you should buy a council house.

If it is possible, it won't be on the south-eastern coast of England where you are currently searching. Property prices are massively inflated by the London commuter belt, among other things.

Cheaper parts of the UK make this dream more realistic (there are Scottish towns where Â£300/month rent will get you a beautiful three-bedroom semi detached townhouse with sea views, all to yourself...), but honestly, I think the budget you outlined in the original post is cutting it too fine to work in real life. There's no saving for unexpected emergencies like losing your job, and no ability to ever advance in life.


Would be better to find a **nice** house share with people you are compatible with, and have more disposable income to boot. Living alone is horrible for most people's mental health anyway, anecdotally it seems that nothing can really take away the constant and crushing loneliness - even if housemates/family can be shite sometimes, I reckon it's still far less bleak than the alternative. Our species never evolved for life alone and a lot of people seem not to realise how much it'll wear them down

null,false,DEADB33F,null,null,null,"Things I'd be looking for in an agent...

1. This one is tricky for a new company, but first and foremost, a good track record at placing long-term trouble-free tenants is essential. Personal recommendations from other landlords is also a massive help. It's very rare that I'll consider doing business with a company that's not been personally recommended by someone else in the industry whom I trust.

2. Flexibility on the fee charged. The company I currently use for one of my residential lets originally charged 10% gross, I negotiated that to drop by 1% every year the tenant remains in the property (up to a 5% discount). 

    My justification was that the only time their high fees can actually be rationalized is when the agent is advertising the property, doing BG checks on prospective tenants, showing the house, etc. Once a long-term tenant is in place the workload for the agent drops to practically zero (not literally, I'm willing to be generous and say it drops by half, hence 10% to 5%).

    Even with this arrangement I still believe it's in the agent's interest to place good tenants as getting 5% for doing very little work is better than 10% for doing a shitload. Since making this arrangement the most recent tenant in that property has been in place for over six years.

3. As has already been mentioned; transparency when it comes to extraneous fees charged. If I'm paying a percentage of gross that's all you should be getting. If you want to start tacking on fees to the tenants or myself then I need to know about these or our relationship will be a short one.",null,0,null,1435096299,null,0,false,0,csgdzsy,null,t3_3atp4j,null,t1_csgdzsy,null,t3_3atp4j,null,null,null,1437296562,null,7,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7,null

null,false,dinvgamma,null,null,null,"Here's as good as any place to post the reasons I'm OK with the transfer.

Cech wants first-team football and wants to stay in London. So we can try to find a buyer or not. If we find a buyer, it has to be a club that can afford to spend upwards of 10m on a keeper -- and so immediately we're only looking at Arsenal. 

If we don't look for a buyer, then we have the 4th-best keeper in the Prem (behind Courtois, De Gea, and Lloris) sitting on the bench, and we're paying his wages for another year. At the end of the season, he leaves on a free. So we've spent 5.2m to use him in 10 matches, most of them early-round FA and League Cups, for which another keeper a la Schwarzer would have been more than sufficient. And then we get nothing for his sale. And we haven't taken a chunk of our rivals' spending money or their wages.

So the calculus goes: Is (Arsenal improvement) - (10.9m transfer) - (Cech wages) &lt;  (16.2m) - (Chelsea backup keeper downgrade)? 

I think it is. Especially when we consider more peripheral things, such as that Cech deserves to be treated well because he's a legend, and that this signals good things to current and future players -- that we'll consider their interests when it's time for them to move on.

One final point: I trust Mou. I trust that he understands our and title rivals' financial positions and player needs more than I do. I don't think that he's infallible, but the odds are that he's more likely right about this than wrong. And even if he is wrong, it's possible to disagree without being *angry* about it.

Aspas was sold for about 4m pounds already. If Sterling goes for 50, that puts us at 54m in outgoing fees accumulated. I think we can assume that Borini, Balotelli, Lambert, Coates, Enrique, Luis Alberto and possibly Lucas will be sold. That group plus Aspas and Sterling should generate a total of about 75-80m pounds to work with. 

Call it 75, take away 30 (being generous) for Firmino, leaving 45. Clyne for 15, Bacca for 25 and Illaramendi for 15 or so (as quoted this week) would see a net spend of only about 10m pounds. Damned good business if you ask me. 

EDIT: I forgot that QPR get 20% of the Sterling fee which would equate to about 10m pounds. So, it would really be about a 20m pound net spend for Liverpool. That remains an excellent window, financially and talent-wise.

We need Oscar to improve, Willian needs to find his goals and more assists and Costa needs to be more consistent. Our current team is still good enough to beat those teams with the signings they are linked to. And we have age on our side too. Costa - I dont get why people here are saying this do they not remember how Costa got injured the second time? he was subbed on and they took a risk which led to his injury they knew he could have injured himself he hadnt fully recovered from the first break. 

If Cuadrado finds form we are in a great position. Traore would be an adequate 3rd striker. Even if Arsenal get Cech and a world class striker (they wont get a world class striker) they still arent better than us. I cant tell the future but i cant wait to come back to these comments next season and see all the people that fed into the Arsenal fans delusion look back and wonder why they said Arsenal with him can dethrone us. let me make it clear though I am saying if we play on form so we do need to play well as well, its not a given. Did you not see how good Ramires was in the Arsenal match? we have the players! a lot of them (mainly Oscar) turned shit at some point in the season. Im not saying we dont need replacements im just saying stop overexagerrating Arsenal with Cech (and their hypothetical signings) they get a new striker whatever; man for man, team for team, and age is where we are superior regardless. I'm not saying this means anything because i cant predict the future but i hate people talking up Arsenal when they've done fuck all to prove they can seriously take it, they came 3rd this year not 2nd remember and City gave up in March. sorry for essay.

I think we all appreciate what Cech has done for us, but I think some (maybe newer) fans forget that **it's his fucking job**. 

Cech and Lampard are ultimate professionals. They are 'classy', in that they are not mercenaries and have served us well, but they also think about themselves first. There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, we definitely have age on our side (except for Terry who's showing no signs of a decline yet).

Costa doesn't need to be more consistent because he's consistent as fuck, he just needs to sort out his injury which will probably never happen, he's stuck with it.

Also I'd like to make it clear that I **do not** think Cech will stop Chelsea from a title, although it does increase their chances (as Terry said), and I do think Wenger is overrated and probably will finish 3rd or 4th again next year.

But go to Spain, Italy or Netherlands the back 3 is regularly used there. We have a manager that is suspect defensively and has a formation that hides those mistakes. He's also smart enough to know how to use it effectively.

Both our shots on target per game and our goals scored per game went up since the move to 3-4-3, so it's not affecting us negatively. However, the lone forward that we utilised in that period of time did. A 3-4-1-2, or a 3-3-1-3 with true wingers could help that, although the second one is very, very adventurous and would require some serious balls, or a week or 2 looking at Bielsa.

Here's another stat: When we used a 3-4-3 formation, in the games against Arsenal and Man Utd, we had more shots on target in those 2 games than the previous 6 combined.

Well â¦ nothing stops you _getting_ A-Levels.  Indeed, it's actually pretty common for mature students to do one or two before going to uni (evening classes are common, day study might work better for you; check collages near you). 

You will find that most Uni's will offer reduced entry qualifications to mature students, in the case where you've just (re)done the Higher/A-Level most relevant to the course.  That is: you probably won't need to do a full set.  There's a number of reasons for that, but that's not relevant here.

Granted, there'd be a time lag, and full time at Uni isn't really earning much; however, I just wanted to note that it's not impossible, and possibly worth considering.  If you think it might good stepping stone, it's a possibility worth a proper investigation.

**TURN BACK!!! TURN BACK WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!**

(see bottom of post for recommendations if you can't)

Seriously though if you can still change the place you are moving to then don't go to Bristol! 

I had the unfortunate luck of being bought up there and although there are some absolutely stunning sights (Suspension Bridge, Clifton Downs, Leigh Woods only a short walk from the towns center) a majority of the people there are extremely unfriendly and/or incredibly boring. Now this of course doesn't apply to every single person but you'll find it with the majority. 

As you probably know Bristol has a reputation for being quite rough and unfortunately that extends to peoples general attitude in the town. If you go for a night out alone, unless you pull you'll be going home alone as well, it's incredibly difficult to make friends or even strike up conversation and makes London look like a hippy commune.

You WILL get mugged, so don't take anything you can't live without with you, I've seen people being beaten/mugged in broad daylight in the center and police just drive right on by. If your gay/trans then you'll have a horrible time. There is 1 gay club (Queens Shilling but it's known locally as the Queens Killing) and unfortunately it's frequented by mostly straight guys and lesbians. Vibes used to be next door but it got raided then shut down, Bristol is incredibly trans/homophobic.

If your Asian/black you can forget it unless you want to live in St Pauls (if your gangster type black) or Stapleton Road/Easton (Asian)


If you can't change your plans and 'have' to move to Bristol, then Clifton, Most of Redland, St Andrews, Southville and Gloucester Road (and surrounding areas) are the safest places. Montpellier is the most fun place but not the safest and pretty much anywhere else I'd avoid. The worst of the worst would be St Pauls, Easton, Heartcliffe, Southmead, Kingswood, Bradley Stoke (It's known as Sadly Broke by the locals), Little Stoke, Bedminister or pretty much anywhere on the outskirts.

There aren't that many safe/good bars in or near downtown but The Hatchet &amp; Mr Wolfs seem to be the best, The Crown is good but avoid on Fridays. For clubs again Mr Wolfs, possibly Bierkeller sometimes, Lakota sometimes and The Black Swan (for gods sake check the events first, and get a taxi their and back though you don't want to walk down Stapleton Road at night (or any time of the day)).

Bristol is 'missing' a student lifestyle due to most of the students being super rich, and incredibly boring (they are only interested in making money and a career, nowt wrong with that but it doesn't make for a particularly entertaining evening).

If you are sadist and wish to subject yourself to hell, or if you are religious and wish to get a quick 'peek' into the lowest bowels of hell then travel to Green Ditch or Southmead (check the ""shops"" near the burnt out cars on the green, in both Green Ditch and Southmead it could easily be the setting for a post apocalyptic movie and if it wasn't so rough I'd take my camera and get some reference shots for my graphic design)

1. I have Â£1200 in a no-interest account and pay Â£100 per month into this high one at 6%, ""drip-feeding it"" in. This approach nets me the equivalent of just whacking it all in a 3% account.

2. I have nothing to start with and pay in Â£100 per month into a 6% regular saver. I get

and 

2) once you know which career you want, try to secure an entry-level job in that field. You have more than enough experience and qualifications to obtain an entry-level NHS job, for example (in fact, you might be over-qualified).

1. Keep your approach simple.
Any management that you have to do, will quickly get boring, and you'll do less of it, lowering your return. Think about how much interest you earn per month. Compare this with your hourly wage, are you better off spending an hour fiddling with your money, or an hour doing more work (although, appreciate that this isn't usually a choice you can make)

2. Put your money 'away'
If you want to avoid spending money, make it harder to get at

3. Focus on *saving* not *investing*
At this point in your life, you'll probably make more money in the long run by investing in yourself, and your skills, rather than trying to make a few quid by juggling interest rates (unless you want to juggle money professionally).

4. Go beyond your target
If you have a planned purchase in mind for savings, save beyond this point before the purchase. I recommend about 50%, so that your savings are never 0.",null,0,null,1435100663,null,0,false,0,csggi1u,null,t3_3atuzg,null,t1_csggi1u,null,t3_3atuzg,null,null,null,1437298313,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

He's unproven to me there. Lucas has proven to be more than solid when fit, so if available, Lucas would always be my first option. 

Also, Can has all the traits for a prototypical box to box, which is where I think he could flourish but what do I know. He enjoys attacking, you can see that instantly when watching him which is a worry when talking about a man who is meant to protect the back 4. 

Look at Coquelin, he's nothing special imo but he knows his task. He doesn't care to attack, he just wants to sit back, parry attacks and distribute quickly to a Cazorla or Ramsey.

Just for reference, I host a few small racing / F1 / gaming themed nights at my house a couple of times a year.

I have four race rigs set up in my living room (wheels, pedals, headphones, etc); So on a couple of F1 race days (normally ones held on bank-holidays) I'll have a bunch of friends &amp; family over. We'll watch the race on the big screen, then have a few heats and races on the simulator-rigs. I'll normally get a keg in and cook food from whatever country the race is held in. 

I had some 20 folks over for Monaco a few weeks ago, and about a dozen last Sunday for the Austrian GP (low turnout as it wasn't a bank-holiday, and was also fathers day).  

Last year I did Spa &amp; Monaco (as both happened to be on bank-holidays).

But it looks like you didnt even watch those.. He scored some screamers? What are you talking about. Did you actually watch one of his games? Honestly? Bc clearly you didn't.

null,false,Bosola,null,null,null,"So: I'm a software engineer. I think you'll be very unhappy as a programmer.

Lots of people become programmers. Some of them have degrees in software engineering. Many do not. But most have an engineering mindset and a longstanding interest in the field. This interest makes writing code quite natural to them, and it makes keeping abreast of the latest technology a hobby rather than a chore.

Now, it's always possible that programming is your hitherto completely hidden talent that you're about to discover and indulge. Some people do get into the field quite late on. But programming is an analytical and logical affair, and I'd expect most programmers to be at least competent mathematicians. Having just a 'C' at GCSE Maths does make me think you need to validate your natural talents before you dive into a degree.

Really, you should already be learning to program and have some kind of personal project in mind. I'd be very surprised if you weren't asked to show one as part of applying for a new degree. If you don't have an academic background in computing, you're going to have to substitute it with evidence of personal interest and proof that you can do it.

Let me ask you: have you ever *actually* written any software? Real software, not trivial tutorial pieces or Codecademy courses. Have you actually solved a problem with code, run your solution and debugged it? A lot of people find it a real slog, and if you're in their number, then you're just not going to make it as a developer.

I'm not being funny, but looking at your posting history, it sounds like you're a bit... well, all over the place. I mean, you took a degree in politics at Leeds Beckett, then discovered six months in that your university's shite. You ask to hire someone to help you with your coursework, because you're struggling, and then all of a sudden you decide you want to be a computer scientist. I don't see any posts in any programming subreddits in your history, nor any indication during this time that you've been thinking about what programming entails.

Then you ask us if you reckon 'cyber security' would be a good degree. Why don't you tell *us*? I mean, dude, this is your one shot at education, and you're not even researching your options. It's like you're floating from one idea to another. You have a 'C' in GCSE Maths and you're thinking about a degree that ends with a module in fucking *cryptography*. Do you have any fucking idea how hard the maths behind cryptography is? It's not fucking quadratic equations, dude. It's *really fucking tough*. Take a look [here](http://www.crypto-textbook.com/).

If you want to be a programmer, go teach yourself and see how far you get. If you succeed, you won't need the degree anyway. Otherwise: take stock of what you're doing and get some plans together. You don't need a STEM degree to get a job. Hey, I studied English, and I'm a programmer (remember?). You don't need *any* degree to get a job. But whatever your plan, don't just jump into the first option that comes up. Validate it. Find ways to test your assumptions.

Nothing as far as I'm aware.  I'm talking about Louis, the mentor of HRH Charles and last viceroy of India - who pulled partition forward without proper planning leading to countless deaths and religious war.

Seriously he is.  He's a fucking idiot.  2 things stick in my mind about him,  Firstly appears on TV talking welsh hill farmers about the importance of going organic - to which they respond that they earn around 12 grand a year and can't afford it - to which he holds his head in his hands and declares 'they just don't understand, they just don't get it.'  No Charles - you don't get it.

Secondly he had the nerve to bang on in the dimbley lectures about how the desire for consumerism and for bigger tvs was a huge issue in the world today.  I mean, the man literally owns 1/6th of cornwall, but I shouldn't get a new TV?  

He's a well meaning but hypocritical idiot whom I'm unable to muster the slightest bit of respect for.

null,false,Galerath,null,null,null,"Comp Sci grad, former software dev here. 

1) No, it's not an indicator. I sucked at maths in school, scraped a C at Higher IIRC, and I got a 1st in Comp Sci at a good uni. The thing is, it's not a ""hard science"" like physics where, especially at the theoretical end, it's all maths. CS degrees are mostly set up to train you as a software developer, and you only really need to know the results of things like Turing's computability work, rather than have to actually prove it yourself. They will probably teach you some set theory and discrete maths, but that's totally different from all the stuff you did in school and I found it a lot easier to get to grips with. 

2) Depends. The applied degrees are really variable in quality. Make sure you know what you're signing up for. Even just reading some wikipedia articles on the appropriate subject will help. The other thing is that some of them will be more applied than others, i.e. if you do something like Networking and Security, that will *not* qualify you as a software dev, and you'll be stuck on the Network/Server Admin career path. Someone with a CS degree however, will have more flexibility.

Now, more generally. 

&gt;I am terrified about my job prospects once uni is complete. 

As others have cautioned, this is exactly the wrong reason to pick Comp Sci. It's a technical degree, and it *is* tough, and you will either ""get it"" or you won't. If you *don't get it* it'll be an incredibly hard slog to even pick up a 2:2. I don't mean to imply that it's any harder than other degrees (such as the much maligned Arts), but that it's not as *accessible*. You need to be able to think in the right way, approach problems in the right way, and have the patience to sit at the computer for hours as a compiler spits unhelpful debug information at you. You need to have an eye for detail and a high boredom threshold. None of these things can really be taught.

On top of that when it comes to earnings you have to realise that Comp Sci, like Economics is skewed by the top 1%. The wizard level programmers will leave uni and found start ups or go straight to large corps and banks and be bombing around in Maseratis before you know it. The rest of us slog away in Corporate back offices, maintaining the code and/or the computers that keep the gears of commerce turning smoothly and being paid decently but not amazingly well for it.

If I haven't put you off yet, then what I advise you to do is to go and research what Computer Science is and what it encompasses. I have already hinted that there are a lot of different roles bound up in a Comp Sci degree, and although such a degree will give you versatility it doesn't specialise you for a particular field. If you want to do something specific, you will need to gain some understanding of that specific field before you apply for it.

If you think you want to be a programmer, then the number one thing you need to do before going and filling out your UCAS form is *learn how to do some programming*. /r/learnprogramming  might be a place to start but I can't vouch for it. I started out with Computing classes at school and Visual Basic. I suspect the current trend will be to recommend you start with Python. Python is a fine language, but it's also very friendly and wipes your arse for you. I found it's better to start with hard languages and learn the easy ones later - if you can write the code in C, it'll be a doddle in Python, but the opposite is not true...

You did ask about specialisations, specifically Security, and how to tell what's good for you. Well, I'd say just head over to Wikipedia and punch in ""Computer Security"" or whatever and get reading. If it looks interesting, go to the website of the department you're thinking of applying to and look for a recommended reading list for first year (if they don't have one, find a better Uni!). I'm sure there'll be a textbook on the reading list, pick it up on Amazon and get reading. If you find it interesting you'll have armed yourself properly for going into first year by doing some pre-reading. If it bores the crap out of you, try something else. (However I must urge caution, especially with Security, as you said you suck at maths. Security is *all about maths*. I only passed the courses on it through learning by rote rather than understanding - it just flew right over my head).

Another way to go about it would be to go to specialist IT recruitment websites and look at the job postings. I was going to link you to the job boards at [El Reg](http://www.theregister.co.uk), but they don't seem to have them anymore :( Anyway, google some specialist IT recruitment agencies, look at the job postings. If they sound interesting, look at the requirements, do some research on the role... you might find you really want to do a specific job and it has specific requirements, then you're onto a winner.",null,0,null,1435104092,null,0,1435104782,0,csgieb5,null,t3_3avtms,null,t1_csgieb5,null,t3_3avtms,null,null,null,1437299620,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

First things first, he's not really worth Â£30m, but as he's Hoffenheims star player, and single handedly got them to where they are this season, you've had to pay for it. He's got a good change of pace, can control it in tight situations, and more importantly for Liverpool, he can be a dirty cunt when the game goes that way. I'd say you've lacked real anger/bite up top since Suarez left (no pun intended) and Gerrard started moving deeper.

He's probably slightly better at finishing and finding space behind a striker than Coutinho, but not better at making a killer pass when facing a center back. 

Good signing for Liverpool in general, but wouldn't say you've got a good deal if Â£29m is the number being touted. That said, you may well have moved fast and paid slightly over the odds to secure your first option, which is what you've failed to do in the past, so take that as a positive.

It's dark in a different direction from what others have suggested - no occult overtones, just straight up mass murder of friends. Plus, if the sky is cloudy and brooding (and it usually is out that way), you can get some really atmospheric pics too.

On a separate but related note; you could always track down locations of more modern mass murderers - http://www.murderuk.com/mass_murderers.html gives a list, although I don't know how complete it is.  That would give you a set of pictures that look perfectly mundane, until one understands the links, at which point the (probable) normality of the scene gets inverted.  Bonus points if you can match the number of people in the photo to the number, and rough description, of the actual victims at those scenes.

Neymar, Ronaldo, messi, etc aren't the best captain material, but being the best player sort of brings a certain influence to the team and gives the player a different role which I think hazard can fulfill. 

I think how he plays should have at least a bit of weight. It's why fullbacks usually aren't captains because they aren't really in the thick of it even if they have good leadership skills. But hazard is everywhere on the pitch. Directly involved in the attack, tracks back, switches the play constantly, etc. 

He's the one that stepped up and took the games by the scruff of the neck when we needed it most and pulled us through. No longer does he sit on the wing waiting for the ball
 He takes control. 

Not saying he should be our captain but when terry retires and IF hazard continues to play the way he does (in how he's the main man) then I think it plays a factor in whether or not he gets captaincy among his other traits.

Sterling right now needs to add finishing, passing, crossing, and positional awareness. Those may be in his ability, but I think it's asking a lot from a guy who has already shown that he's not able to keep his head down to get through adversity. His form dipped tremendously once this contract stuff became news. How's he going to handle being one of the most hated players in England on a club where he won't be more than a rotational player? 

I think Sterling is primed to go down as a sad example of an English player misled by his representation and fucked up by media.

&gt; Intermediate level sanctions of 4 weeks for a first failure, rising to 13 weeks for a second or subsequent failures (within a 52 week period of their last failure) may be applied following a period of disallowance for not actively seeking employment or not being available for work

&gt; Lower level sanctions (for example for failing to attend an adviser interview) will lead to claimants losing all of their JSA for a fixed period of 4 weeks for the first failure, followed by 13 weeks for subsequent failures (within a 52 week period of their last failure)

null,false,-postscript,null,null,null,"Complete noob to skincare here. I have somewhat oily/acne prone skin. I used to only wash my face with soap and water, now I use a basic chemical exfoliant and moisturiser. The outcome has been good so far, a definite improvement but I'm looking at going a bit further and getting a more specific BHA, cleanser and moisturiser but I've got some really stupid questions.

1) Is it really okay to use all these products on your face every day? I see routines that seem really long (Particularly the ones with Asian products) and I wonder how it all fits on the face. Theoretically if I was to use a gel cleanser, then a BHA chemical exfoliant and then a moisturiser...isn't it all gonna smush together or layer on top of each other? From reading routines here I can never work out at which point you should wash stuff off and then add the next product. It seems as though putting moisturiser and then sunscreen on would create some unholy thick oil cream all over your face.

What I do in the morning is this: Splash/Wash face with warm water, put on exfoliant, leave for a few minutes, wash off, put on moisturiser, go out the door.

If I was to introduce other stuff like toners or gel cleansers or something, what would the process be? Is there a rule of thumb to rinse everything off? I feel like your face would feel sticky if it didn't.

2) I noticed on the Bravura London Salicylic Acid 2% video, the lady said to use it every other day. Does this mean you don't use anything else on the days you don't use it or do you carry on with your normal routine without that step? I've just assumed you use everything daily so far so I'm not sure how all this works. It's not really specific to this product, just any 'every other day' product I guess (If they exist, which I'm guessing they do).",null,0,null,1435108959,null,0,false,0,csgl0nj,null,t3_3asz90,null,t1_csgl0nj,null,t3_3asz90,null,null,null,1437301578,null,1,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,1,null
