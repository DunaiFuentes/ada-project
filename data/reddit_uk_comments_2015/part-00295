&gt; watching fools and horses on t.v. and eating egg and chips.


That's about as close as you got to actually answering my question. I'm asking you what you think ""British"" means. I'm asking that question because too many people use it to justify xenophobia (not saying you are but a lot of people do) and say ""oh if these immigrants came and integrated and adapted into British life, we'd be fine"".

OK, so what? Shopping at Tesco? Loving queueing? Drinking tea? Watching X factor? It's very difficult to define what 'British' is and that's fine, and that's my whole point. How can you give these 'immigrants' a standard to reach when they will 'be accepted by British society' if there isn't really any specific things you can mention?

You want them to get jobs? Hell yeah! I want them to contribute to society if they can, too! Control immigration! Of course, that's completely sensible. But what the hell is 'fit in with British society'?


I don't drink. Will I still fit in? Drinking (not necessarily getting smashed, but a pint in the pub) is a massive part of British culture, is that something I need to do to fit in more? My Pakistani-born dad has worked as an NHS orthopaedic surgeon here for 13+ years. He doesn't drink, go to the pub, all his friends and acquaintances are either Asian work friends or people he knows from our local mosque. Is he integrated into society? Because he doesn't have any real 'British' friends, so what does that make him?


Also, you think integrating into a foreign culture is easy? I think it really should be obvious it's incredibly difficult. Something that so many people say (""just fit in, integrate, be BRITISH!"") is not as easy as it looks, and there are much, MUCH easier and BETTER options for an INDIVIDUAL IMMIGRANT coming into the UK.


I lived in Ireland for 8 years in the 90s, and back then at least, there were hardly ANY non-white people living where we were. So my mum and us kids are in the shopping mall, and my mum is going about her business. She sees white, Irish mums around her, but she doesn't stop and talk to them randomly, just keeps going from shop to shop. Suddenly she sees an Indian woman with her two kids coming the other way. They've never met before, but they both stop, smile and start up a conversation. They don't even speak the same language, so they're conversing in their broken English, which is difficult for both of them. But why did my mum and this Indian lady stop and talk to one another immediately? They saw a familiar face in a see of unfamiliar ones. Someone who is from where they're from. Who they can relate to. Who would have similar experiences. And so who would likely make a great friend. Would my mum make friends with an Irish woman? She would, and she did when we were in Ireland, lots of times. But the experiences and relatability that this Indian woman had could not ever be matched by any Irish woman, and that's why they both stopped.


Now if you're for some reason immigrating to Pakistan and you want to live in Lahore. Awesome city. You know that in North Lahore, there is a group of British immigrants living on a certain street. Would you not want to try and live on that street? Or would you think ""oh I must try and integrate into Pakistani culture and not start a trend of creating pockets of British immigrants across Lahore. That would freak out the locals!"". As an individual, I hope you agree you'll choose that street in North Lahore every single time.


Multiply that by 10,000 and you have the situation we have today.

Our politicians were quite happy to sweep Litvinenko under the carpet so long as he was a one-off thing, so long as his death was only Putin flexing his muscles, or the enforcement of omertà upon his own citizens. 

Western politicians are currently asking themselves what sanctions they can impose without rocking the boat too much and harming their own interests (i.e. those of western economies trading with Russia).

Questions will be designed in an open manner to get you to open up and give examples of how you have fulfilled the competencies listed against the job spec. If you can come up with a good spiel in your application for each competency, there is a very good chance that you will be selected for interview, then you do something similar there, with more explanation. Different interviewers do things slightly differently here; some will expect you to elaborate on the examples you have given in your application, others will expect a different set; be prepared for both. [This PDF](https://civilservicelearning.civilservice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/applying_for_a_job_learning_resource_v5rev.pdf) will help you to understand what the interviewer is looking for and on what sort of criteria you will be marked.

If you don't pass the sift or interview, be sure to get in touch with the interviewer/contact to get some feedback; that should help you to do better next time.

Having a car pass you at speed when you're out unprotected, not expecting it, and tired from a long ride can be pretty terrifying. Not just that, but I may have to dodge an obstacle that may seem relatively minor to you and move suddenly. I've blown a lot of tyres on potholes that I couldn't avoid because somebody was bearing down on me in my blindspot.

 I'm a fairly confident rider but when a car passes me closely, even slowly, it's hard not to wobble. Just treat the cyclist as if they are as wide as a car.

Obviously that's not always possible in a city, but do try to give as much space as you and don't squeeze past in roadworks. If it's in the country and the traffic is light, moving into the next lane is preferable.

It literally takes no effort and being caught behind a cyclist for even a full minute (which is rare) hardly slows your overall journey down at all.

What if they refuse the offer to go home? Where do they go then?

&gt;3: A refugee camp will be opened in a suitably stable, democratic, and distant country - using the UK and France's foreign aid budget. This camp will hold people who refuse to state their nation of origin after having been denied asylum.

This is where the majority of the migrants would go as a large amount would be scared to state where they're from if it meant being transported back.

&gt; 4: The UK and France also attempt to alleviate or end the causes of emigration. Asylum seekers could assist this project by sharing their experiences.

In some cases the only thing that would alleviate the problems in these countries would be military intervention and nation building. Is the public prepared to put up both the moral and financial capital to follow this course of action?

Pick a field you're somewhat interested in and work your way up from the bottom.

""I used to wash the dishes here, now I own the place.""

People don't become successful by accident, you have to work hard and take chances and find opportunities. 

You'll find it difficult, you'll have to sell yourself but once you get your foot on a ladder, you can start climbing and be proud of your achievements. You'll feel better about yourself and that'll show, employers will start wanting you. 

But it won't be easy and you will want to quit at points. So set yourself small goals to achieve over time.

Now all I have to do is take my own advice :) 

Good luck mate, I've been where you are but there is a way out! 

Don't give up! Find something/someone to love and get yourself a purpose/responsibility because it's easy to neglect yourself but when you have to look after someone/something else, you might give it more care and attention.

If you don't have a criminal record, places like airports recruit heavily in the summer for obvious reasons, being a check in agent or a baggage handler is not hard, but they like a good attitude.

If you cannot find an apprenticeship try to create your own. Ring as many plumbers, carpenters, electricians, plasterers as it takes to find the one who needs a dirt cheap assistant will to do all the shitty jobs for a year or two, so that you can work your way to viable skillset.

You can start this today by helping people for nothing and getting decent references out of it by volunteering in charity shops, becoming a handy man for hire - start to develop skills in things you like and are accessible like gardening or painting perhaps.

Really.  Try living with a disability and trying to navigate a pavement almost completely blocked by a parked car.  Try not to trip over the badly-damaged flagstones, caused by parked cars.

* In Great Britain between 2009 and 2013, one pedestrian was killed in an incident involving a cycle on a footway or verge, whereas on average, 34 pedestrians each year were killed by vehicles on the footway/verge
* In London (1998-2007), just 2% of pedestrian collision injuries on the pavement involved cycles; the other 98% involved motor vehicles

So you could go to college and do your A-Levels as a mature student, pay the fees and live off the rest of the money. If you're able to work part time stacking shelves etc during the studying then you'd make the 10k stretch both years easily. Then you're freshly qualified, and obviously shown you're determined and commited to do what you chose to study. If you choose some vocational A-Levels (or Btecs or whatever else there is, theres loads now) that will qualify you for a specific job, which has openings and demand, then you should be able to start that career.

Keep in mind, if you take out the full 10k over the full 5 years, then you will be paying 212 a month back for 5 years when you are done.

Unfortunately for Borini, he does not possess a key attribute to be a PL striker - he cannot hold the ball up. He doesn't have one of touch, pace, strength or height that is necessary to keep the ball to allow our midfielders to move up the pitch on transitions. Simply put, he lost the ball too often, and did not have the trust of our midfield. It would never have worked long-term, and Sterling was the best solution.

null,null,2econdclasscitizen,null,null,null,"Information about health is 'sensitive personal data' under the Data Protection Act. There are various requirements that have to be satisfied before an employer can legitimately gather health-related information about an employee. 

Here's a link to some guidance for employers on data protection issues from the Information Commissioner's Office, the body that regulates and enforces the law in relation to information rights: https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1066/employment_practice_code_supplementary_guidance.pdf

The section on information about health starts on page 64. 

Essentially, information should only be gathered and kept where it is relevant and proportionate for a specific and legitimate purpose. I'm not familiar with how this is interpreted and what it means in practice, but taken as written I don't think employers should make general enquiries about employee health for no reason. If there's a specific reason - such as when obtaining an group insurance policy for employees, or to investigate a long-term absence - then there might be sufficient basis. 

So I'd start by asking your employer why they need the information. If it just wants to know, I doubt you'd have to answer.

Firstly, the ripper was an exceptionally skilled killer. He was adept at taking adult victims in public places without apparent pursuit, struggle or injury to himself. That's very difficult and not easily learned. The vast majority of serial killers talk, often wryly, of the terrible mess they made of their first victims; it seems likely that the ripper had a number of earlier victims who have gone undetected or at least unconnected to his later crimes. Possibly these were committed in other countries. 

Secondly, his crimes would suggest that he was severely disordered. Contrary to popular belief there is no link between psychopathology and intelligence; the trope of the suave serial killer who moves easily in sparkling social circles is very much the exception. Most severely deranged serial killers are loners and don't fit well in normal society. I very much doubt the ripper could pass for normal for long in any one place - anyone spending time with him as a work colleague for example would quickly realise he was acutely disturbed. He likely moved around a lot and found it difficult to hold down jobs or friendships. 

The recent theories like this one don't seem to address these likelihoods. Although maybe they're just *my* theory. ;)",null,0,null,1438420219,null,null,false,0,ctns3nm,null,t3_3fe0t9,null,null,null,t3_3fe0t9,null,null,null,1440216911,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Every time these anti-BBC comments come out it is the same seemingly-deliberate misconstruing of what someone has said, with crazy strawmen. 

The BBC has a charter to provide a service to the public. Providing entertainment is necessarily a part of this because this is what we expect from TV channels. 

If we consider what is necessary merely to survive then TV does not factor into it at all.

Now it is reasonable to ask why there should be a state-owned broadcaster (not government-owned, like you said) at all. The reason is that, pragmatically, we get a good service from it.

One can argue why the state provides healthcare. Pragmatically it does a good job. 

One can argue why the state should provide bicycles. The argument against being that there is no precedent for this and commercial bicycle manufacturers can provide just as good, and cheaper, bikes than we might see provided by the state.

We don't see this argument in broadcasting or healthcare as neither is true for those. Commercial broadcasters would not produce, say, the Today programme. It just couldn't happen.

To elaborate on what /u/terrynutkinsfinger said, there are actually *two* castles in Llandeilo, and they're both awesome. The first, [Carreg Cennen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreg_Cennen_Castle) is a few miles south-west of the town. It couldn't be more dramatically sited - on a cliff overlooking the Black Mountain. The castle itself is an extremely imposing Norman construction, and even comes with its own cave system to explore. Be sure to bring a torch.

[Dinefwr Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinefwr_Castle) is one of my favourites. It's located on a wooded hill overlooking the Tywi floodplain. It's a native Welsh castle, and was the heart of the Kingdom of Deheubarth in Rhys ap Gruffydd's day.

2. The player that I really think will shine for us this season is Coutinho. Last season there were moments of brilliance and I think if he continues his trend of playing better and better I really see him flourishing this season (hopefully with a decent striker, Benteke, in front of him)

3. Lineup is something I'm not certain on. I could see us playing a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3. I think we'll opt for the 4-3-3 to give a better defensive edge by ensuring our midfield isn't overrun.

Always hard to predict because pre season isn't always reliable. I expect us to finish somewhere **5th or 4th** depending on our players linking well. Luckily a few of the player we got (Milner, Ings and Clyne) are English and have some chemistry already to join Henderson, Lallana and Sturridge.

Milner will be seen as our best transfer since he came on a free but our star will be Henderson, I feel as captain he will try harder than normal to impress.

While you're probably right- there's no law to say that they can't fall further. Their lowest ever results were 2.5%, and they'ev had many results in the 20th Century below 8%. It took them decades of (essentially) outmanoeuvring Labour to get to the support they were at in 2005/10 (flanking to the vacant left during the Blair years, absorbing Labour's right during the SDP years). There's no guarantee they'll be gifted such luck in the future, especially not with the left-wing territory now firmly occupied by the Greens/SNP, and UKIP vying for more right-wing ""protest votes"". 

To put it into context, their vote share has never been as low as it is now since (counting predecessor parties) the period 1930s-1970s. It took them 40 years to recover last time they were this low, and the only time they've ever scored as highly as in 2010 in the last 100 years was during periods of Labour turmoil (the SDP split, Callaghan, MacDonald). 

If 2010 taught us as a party nothing, it's that we can't just think of the Lib Dems as some harmless lefty offshoot.

null,null,Serex123,null,null,null,"BMI is a useful tool for as part of assessing basic health risks, particularly lower limb injuries. A BMI is a good indicator that someone in extended training in the context of an event or physically demanding job will either fail to meet or keep to fitness requirements or will develop a dehibilitating injury. Many organisations, including the military and the police still incorporate BMI measurements as part of a fitness assessment. Many will fail or exclude peolle if their BMI is beyond a certain point, and its often done because data within that organisation demonstrates that a very high (or very low) BMI is positively correlated with injury, sickness; or health risk.

I'm fully aware that having a BMI outside ""the normal"" range is not always an indicator of poor fitness, especially for athletes and others who have physically demanding lifestyles. Nor is BMI the best or only tool. But its a helpful measurement. A distance runner, for example, is reducing the force on his or her body by several hundred pounds over an hour long race with each pound of bodyweight loss. Therefore measuring BMI changes is useful. rugby players tend to measure BMI as a useful tool because a higher BMI tends to demonstrate more power except when changes are due to fat increases. But 38 is excessive. It woukd be excessive for most rugby players, heavyweight boxers or even an anerican football player. And they are professional athletes, and usually an athlete with an extremeely heavy frane plays a very specific role. The police can be and often is a physically demanding job, but its not a continuous physical work and they aren't athletes either.

But anyway, i'm just usig the blokes BMI as an example, although I do maintain that a BMI of 38 is excessive. The police's fitness requirements are very low. They may not necessarily need higher standards, but they are still very low. I'd hazard a guess that a 6ft 300lb man is quite limited on the type of physical work he could perform.

If you were registering to vote for the leader with no intention of ever voting Labour in an election (such as the Telegraph's suggestion that Tories should do) that would be a rather different matter.

There's a declaration you have to make when you sign up as a supporter which more or less covers it:

&gt;I support the aims and values of the Labour Party, and I am not a supporter of any organisation opposed to it.

If you can honestly make that statement, you're welcome to become a supporter. If you feel that making that statement would be bending the truth, then you aren't. That's about the size of it!

&gt;Do you think it right that I become a member registered supporter? Is it entryist? Is it disrespectful to paid up members who have devoted many years to the cause?

Polls before the last election had Labour and the Tories neck and neck, then the Tories got a majority - the reason being that nearly 2 million people who said they would vote Labour, didn't bother to turn out, they need to give those people something to vote for.

Another point - if you also look at the average demographic of a UKIP voter, they could be persuaded by Corbyn - over 70% of UKIP voters favour renationalisation of key industries, so does Corbyn. He is also tough on the EU - he wants to stay in for now, but only, and he actually means it, if we can work with the rest of Europe to reform it.

Yeah, and then kept that formation even when it was obvious that teams had figured out how to neutralise it. Post-Christmas, it was clear that Swansea had found a way to stop our attack, and yet Rodgers carried on with the same plan of attack for every game after that. 

&gt; got us playing alright

""Alright"" is the key word there. We had a good run but if you look at the games objectively we didn't actually play *that* well. We got the points, and I'd argue that's all that matters, but we were struggling against some teams. It was 13/14 season levels of destruction by any means, it was just passable to get the points. 

&gt; he tried to make the best out of what he had available 

That sounds like he came in mid-season to a club with limited resources. What he had available was the players he'd bought the summer before -- they were targets that the transfer committee had agreed on and, as far as I know, apart from Balo, Rodgers wanted each of the people we brought in. 

I take your point about the strikers but, really, we weren't even creating many chances -- it took worldies from Couts to win us a couple of games. Having Studge would have made a lot of difference but, really, Lambert and Borini are both the kind of strikers who *can* score if the chances are made often enough.

* Eritrea (3,239)

&gt; The British placed Eritrea under British military administration until Allied forces could determine its fate. The first thing the British did was to dismantle and confiscate the Eritrean industries as war compensation, including parts of the Eritrean Railway system.

&gt; In the absence of agreement amongst the Allies concerning the status of Eritrea, British administration continued for the remainder of World War II and until 1950.

* Pakistan (2,711)

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Line

&gt; Radcliffe justified the casual division with the truism that no matter what he did, people would suffer. The thinking behind this justification may never be known since Radcliffe ""destroyed all his papers before he left India"". He departed on Independence Day itself, before even the boundary awards were distributed. By his own admission, Radcliffe was heavily influenced by his lack of fitness for the Indian climate and his eagerness to depart India.

&gt; ...

&gt; After the partition, the fledgling governments of India and Pakistan were left with all responsibility to implement the border. After visiting Lahore in August, Viceroy Mountbatten hastily arranged a Punjab Boundary Force to keep the peace around Lahore, but 50,000 men was not enough to prevent thousands of killings, 77% of which were in the rural areas. Given the size of the territory, the force amounted to less than one soldier per square mile. This was not enough to protect the cities much less the caravans of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing their homes in what would become Pakistan.

* Iran (2,011)

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat

&gt; The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup, was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot"") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project).

&gt; Mossadegh had sought to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now BP) and to change the terms of the company's access to Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize the assets of the company and expel their representatives from the country. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king), to rule the country more firmly as monarch.

* Sri Lanka (1,282)

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War

&gt; For over 25 years, the war caused significant hardships for the population, environment and the economy of the country, with an estimated 80,000–100,000 people killed during its course.

&gt; ...

&gt; The origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The roots of the modern conflict lie in the British colonial rule when the country was known as Ceylon.

* Nigeria (875)

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War

&gt; The British colonial ideology that divided Nigeria into three regions—North, West and East—exacerbated the already well-developed economic, political, and social differences among Nigeria's different ethnic groups.

Coutinho, because he is now surrounded by a proper striker and a good partner in the attacking midfield (Firmino). I think he'll thrive with the space he will be given compared to last year where he was our main threat. Benteke is my other guess, simply because he seems like a quality player and he will (hopefully) be getting good service.

Blackbushe, on the other hand, is an utter dump. It's best known for a Sunday market where back in the day you could get knock off DVDs, but now only sells cheap plastic shit. The flying facilities are only used by a flying school and for flying enthusiasts who own small, two seater planes. It has zero immigration facilities (meaning no flight coming from outside the UK should land there) and the 'terminal' is basically a concrete shed. 

There's no reason to land at Blackbushe for safety reasons either, as not only would a plane with terminal engine failure still be able to glide into Farnborough, but the fire and rescue facilities at Blackbushe are nothing like they are at Farnborough. 

This is why pretty much every local person's first thought will be why on earth are they landing at Blackbushe?

that's interesting. So you where taught the importance of riding centrally?

No one forced the motorist to-do anything. Pointing fingers saying ""he made me jump of the cliff"" wont hold up.

Also, I drive regularly too, get stuck behind all kinds of people (cyclists included). I have no problem waiting. Cannot understand how that's so difficult for others.

We will trouble teams in TOP4 and stay close. Waiting for someone to slip. If no one slips then I think we will be  5th. Or we can be typical LFC and bottle it at the start of the season and then go on a unbelievable run later on with disappointment at the end

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

Coutinho, he is getting better and better every season, he had flashes last season and I believe he will finally manage to stay consistent and prove that he is one of the best CAM in the league and in the world.

There's a lot of discussion amongst the best way to describe someone with a disability, and there are two schools of thought.

2. ""person with disabilities"" ... the emphasis being on the person at the start, with disabilities being secondary to that.

The same applies here with flock.  If you were to say ""people flocked"" then you're saying these are people, that acted in such a way.  The other way around however, and you deindividualize, and take the focus away from the fact that they are people.

You can't just walk in and buy a car on finance until you work out your financial status.

My personal advice would be to buy a smaller car, up to £2k, you can get something 6/7 years old fairly low mileage for that. Which is a pretty decent motor. 

Unless you have a very good financial income, credit history and parents willing to support a new vehicle too get a second hand motor.

New vehicles need religious servicing for the terms of the warranty, you then have all the other add ons, tyres, brakes etc etc. so a £150 a month car isn't just £150.

So everytime you are ""anti-business"" a dog-whistle goes off in people's brains ""these people will create job losses"". A Labour party causing job losses is a Labour party that is going to lose an election - and we did.

Regarding ""big business"" - by that people mean Google, Starbucks etc who are evading taxes. Yet the only way to stop them is to leave the EU - yet Ed Miliband was ""I lurve the EU, anything they do is OK with me"".

So you got a double whammy - Labour will cause job losses yet let multi-nationals like Google to continue evade tax.

Can you see the problem?

We could look for a site in Surrey but the board seem to think this wouldn't work well as where we are in Beckenham is easy to get to which helps us to sign kids. TBH with EPPP removing the requirement for clubs to only go for kid within a certain distance from them we might as well move out into the sticks instead of wasting time looking for a non-existent location in South London.

On The left wing, you could shift Eriksen out wide, but I feel that he doesn't have the defensive ability to work there. Townsend could work there, but I think he is far better on the right-side. I wouldn't want him to be there for a few games. Lamela doesn't work well on the left and I can't think of any time that he has been used well there.

null,null,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,null,"&gt; How do you think this season will go? 

I'm fairly optimistic about our chances at top 4, even though that's a contrived statement for a Liverpool fan. I think we've strengthened in the positions that we needed to, especially with regards to a striker, and the added benefit of more creativity in midfield (with Firmino) should mean we create more chances than we did last year. Apart from that, we'll need to shore up the defence a little, and just hope that Sturridge isn't injured for a significant portion of the season -- because, when he's on form, he's formidable. 

&gt; Which player will be your star of the season and why? 

I'm going to go slightly left-field here and say Milner. He's looked great in preseason and, whilst that's no guarantee of his form for the season, it's encouraging to see the signs of him already linking up with the other players. Plus, I think his experience will be a real bonus for us -- especially since the loss of Gerrard will have no doubt affected the squad in that regard. 

&gt; How do you think the squad will line up? 

I think with the purchase of Clyne, Rodgers will go back to 4 in defence. This will most likely be Clyne, Skrtel, Sakho and Moreno at first, but I have a feeling we'll see Gomez sneak into that LB position as Christmas grows nearer. 

As for midfield, I think we'll use Lucas as much as possible, surrounded by Hendo, Milner and Couts/Firmino. Obviously, for more attacking formations, both Couts and Firmino will be on the pitch at the same time, meaning we'll most likely lose Milner/Lucas. I can see Lallana being an important factor for us this season too, so it's going to be a very competitive area of the team. 

As for strikers, I think Rodgers will go for Benteke and Sturridge when the latter is fit -- they'll most likely play similarly to how Sturridge/Suarez played, with no concrete positioning and flowing movement. When Studge isn't fit, Benteke will probably be the lone striker, with Ings partnering occasionally. Origi will most likely see playing time on the wings rather than up front.

During the season there were times where Balo was the best performer in a struggling side and was still called out by Rodgers which left many wondering exactly what the hell was going on. In my mind its one of two things, Rodgers never wanted to work with him per what is mentioned above, or Balo was extremely disruptive and missed a lot of training.

While they do say that elections are won from the centre people still need a _reason_ to vote for parties beyond voting just ""red"" or ""blue"" and the centre of the UK population at the time of the next election is not known, perhaps it might even lurch a little left.

This is how I see the stats
Az isnt very good in the air. fact. This guy looks like he is. this could be a good option such as set pieces where Az has struggled in the past.
Az doesn't attack very often we know that and stats reflect it. Az is more used as a reliable defensive full back a job he is excellent at. This guy is more attacking so offers a different option.
Az has made 0 defensive errors in 2481 minutes of football. This guy has made more.
Baba has had to make a lot of tackles and interceptions. we know he played for a mid table team in Bundesliga so therefore we know he can handle pressure and constant attack which is what he will have to contend with if he covers for Az during injury or cup games.

What I also saw is that Az's defensive score is much higher as is his total score which confirmed my high regard I have for Az. Maybe I read stats differently to you?

Slightly worried about the defensive aspect of that midfield however even though we do have players who will contribute defensively such as Firmino, Henderson etc. 

I think we make a strong push for 4th with our strikeforce, I'm feeling confident with Benteke.

With Origi and Ings on the bench I'm really happy with them being able to play against tired legs and bagging a few goals.

The British Library is a result of the 'fuck it' school of architecture design where after months (even years) of thought and committee planning, the chief architect at 4am before the deadline at 9am just throws a rectangle on their CAD application and extrudes a 3D cuboid about four floors upward, slaps on either a pebble-dash or stretcher-bond brick fascia and calls it a day.

All the ivory tower RIBA M.Arch types will fawn over this as a new modernist masterpiece, heralding a brave new era of architecture while ignoring the deafening lamentations of the man-on-the-street that has to live near the depressing Borg cube.

It boggles my mind that the Gothic Revival architecture of the St Pancras Hotel looks better from the sky than the 1980's shopping-centre style of the British Library, even though it was built decades before heavier-than-air flight was invented.

null,null,thrillerv,lfc55,,null,"&gt; How do you think this season will go?

Relative to last season, I believe we will be a lot more consistent &amp; find our groove a lot sooner. Relative to the competition, we'll be in and around top 4 to the end of the season. I think we will finish 4th, edging out United. We'll relieve the creative burden off Coutinho w/ Firmino &amp; Milner and the goal pressure off Sturridge w/ Benteke &amp; Ings. These two aspects is what has got me confident as that was what was most troubling last season. Also, can't forget to mention the addition of Clyne. We haven't had a proper RB since peak Johnson, that will be **huge** for us. 

&gt; Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

Benteke. I haven't been this confident about a signing in a while to be honest. I think he'll take the league by storm with the creativity he's got behind him now. I'm expecting 20 or so goals from him. A lot haven't seen Villa play regularly, think a lot of PL watchers will be surprised to see just how good this guy is &amp; have that image of a target man erased from peoples' minds. 

&gt; How do you think the team will line up? 

I'm going to omit Studge since he'll be out till October...

I believe for any immigration system to work well it needs to have some notion of fairness built in. These people in Calais are completely abusing our system. To get into this country you need to pass certain criteria. Regardless of what that criteria is it simply shouldn't be subverted by undertaking a criminal offence.

What kind of system would it be if we allowed in the criminals while turning away all those who did things completely by the book?

Fuelling a property bubble and placing billions of tax payers money at risk al la the sub prime mortgage crisis.

And reduced benefits at the same time. Also forced many social landlords to switch to ""market rate"" rents increasing the costs to social renters by £50 million in London alone.

null,null,Londonman007bond,null,null,null,"Okay, I see why you disagree about Townsend. However, we don't play with traditional wingers and I don't think crossing is a good way to create chances leading to a goal. Most crosses go to the keeper or are cleared by the defender. 

The most memorable cross that comes to mind is the one that Kane scored against the Scum. Where did the come from? Quite deep on the left from Bentaleb, not requiring to beat the fullback. 

I'm not saying that crossing doesn't work or has no use in the game, but I don't see it as a way forward for us or a replacement for having a player that cuts in. 

Even if Townsend is better on the left, I don't see him playing there for us. Again, this is just how I see the game that we play at the moment.


Also, I personally would be more upset not having Chadli playing than any other player on the pitch. I know that he didn't play for us in the academy, he is invisible in some games and that he is not the best player in the squad (hence Lloris is second). There is just something about him.

I bought this refurbished earlier this year and it's awesome. It's never
skipped a beat but I no longer have a use for it and wish to see it go to
someone who does.

**Specs:**

* Intel Core2 Duo (T7100) 1.80GHz
* 3GB RAM
* 80GB HDD
* Extended battery (lasts ~7+ hours!)
* Xubuntu operating system

It came with Windows 7 which could probably but reinstalled using the license
sicker on the underside of the machine. However, I'd encourage running
GNU/Linux instead as it's much faster, much more battery friendly, and it's
free. :)

Photos should show the condition - it was listed as grade A when I purchased it
from the refurb store and it really is smart looking. It's in perfect working
order with only a few small cosmetics: It has a [small hairline crack on the
bottom right of the case](http://i.imgur.com/UqKw3dx.jpg), it's missing a single
rubber foot on the bottom, and [the top has some general wear](http://i.imgur.com/XZ5gVYQ.jpg).

Any questions please ask!

It's why I hate debating with left wing people now, you exist in a bullshit bubble where untruths are readily received while a fair assessment of policy is attacked quite vociferously, and i've been on the left all my life - I just believe in truth and reason rather than over the top nonsense. The British Conservative party is a centrist/center right party with right wing members, but it is the centrists/centre right who are firmly in charge of the show. Labour does not represent the centre ground of politics (they're centrists/center left, and moving further left). 

&gt;Hard to avoid spending on roads; the rails spending is a subsidy for the railway operators, HS2 largely a white elephant.

Said spending puts people to work, I completely disagree with you about HS2 and think it's time the cradle of the railway had a 21st century rail network. Go to Europe, even Spain has a better rail network than we do. I'd be in favor of re-nationalization if I felt that the government could actually do a good job of running it (protip: British Rail was a joke, and not a particularly funny one).

&gt;Fuelling a property bubble and placing billions of tax payers money at risk al la the sub prime mortgage crisis.

Helping everyday people get onto the properly ladder so they no longer have to pay exorbitant rents to private landlords is not a bad thing. How else do you propose to help people own their own homes? The government can't put price controls on houses, and there clearly isn't enough house building going on so helping people to buy homes that already exist seems to me to be quite centrist.  

&gt;And reduced benefits at the same time. Also forced many social landlords to switch to ""market rate"" rents increasing the costs to social renters by £50 million in London alone.

We do have a budget deficit to tackle, the interest payments on our current debt are already greater than our entire defense budget. Some benefits needed to be cut, if only to incentivize people to go out and work. Go to the north east, there are entire generations of people who live off the state and it needs to stop: it's not good for the country or the people stuck in that cycle of poverty. By forcing social landlords to switch to market rent, what are you referring to? Social housing groups mutualizing (read: privatizing)? Because that wasn't something the government forced them to do. Or are you talking about forcing people who earn over a certain amount pay market rents instead of subsidized rent? Because if that's the case that isn't a bad thing... why should someone with a higher income pay a subsidized rent when there are plenty of lower income people who could live in that social housing but cant because someone who is earning £40k per year is living there for a few hundred quid a month? I can see how this would be problematic in London but that's a London/south east specific problem.

&gt;It was IDS who was calling for them to be taxed last year though!

But the 2015 budget kept/moved that benefit out of tax so clearly IDS wasn't listened to.

&gt;Cough cough cough! Just what we &lt;whhhhhhheeeezzee&gt; need.

Do you know how crap public transport is outside of the major cities? People still need to drive, cutting how much that costs is a good thing for many people. It makes them happy. Grow up.

It's not as if the government haven't also implemented things like the cycle-to-work scheme, either. 

Abolishing non-dom status for people who have been here for 15 years is more sensible than the way Labour proposed doing it as it maintains the status for people who do deserve it and avoids a mass exodus (thereby reducing the amount of tax you take in) by targeting those who have been in the country and set up ties here (it's harder to leave if you've been here for 15 years).

I'm inclined to agree on apprenticeships but some of them are very valid.

&gt;Indeed it can, as can the arguments of WHY these are not necessarily a good thing, what the alternatives are and how those will make peoples lives better.

We weren't arguing whether these things were good or whether alternatives were better, we were arguing over whether these policies were centrist. Any reasonably-minded person would agree that these are centrist policies. Could alternative policies work better? Possibly. But that's not what your point was.

Borini's had his opportunities and he hasn't impressed in them. And there is no chance of him getting even more opportunities than the odd start and substitute appearance he currently experiences now because we have Sturridge, Benteke, Ings and Origi who are all more likely to start than him (although Origi would be more on potential than current ability).

I think that for the sake of his playing career, he should make a move away but I also accept that he is a human being and as such leaving your current job/city is never that easy (apparently he's sticking around because of his missus). But I don't think that he warrants the praise that Henderson gets because they both set out on the same journey but Hendo did the distance.

(ManU fan - they have an Adidas equipment too now, but they don't have the ""authentic"" version yet). After wasting 30 minutes of my life trying to figure it out, here are the differences between them:

The ""non-authentic"" (also called ""replica"" on the Adidas official store):
- has Climacool technology
- has woven Adidas logo and ChelseaFC logo

VS 

""Authentic"":
- has Adizero technology (I assume more ventilation sockets or something)
- the Adidas and ChelseaFC badges are applied through heat transfer (i.e. they seem like part of the jersey, the same way the sponsor's name is applied)


It's such a tiny difference that costs $30 basically :) I got the Replica from an official Adidas store. They didn't even have the authentic one there.

&gt; Koeman will be paying close attention to Rodriguez’s progress when he faces the Spanish side, who were first visitors to St Mary’s when the stadium opened in 2001.

&gt; Even though fans are desperate to see the top scorer from the 2013/14 season back in regular action for the first team in competitive games, Koeman is still trying to ensure his comeback is not blighted by further problems.

&gt; However, the Saints boss has not entirely ruled out Rodriguez featuring in the return leg at Vitesse next Thursday night if everything goes well this weekend.

&gt; “It’s possible because he’s doing well, he’s not really like before but that’s normal because a long time out of competition football,” admitted Koeman.

&gt;*I say this because I want to emphasis I hate this situation not in spite of these view but because of them. **I believe for any immigration system to work well it needs to have some notion of fairness built in.***

The immigration over the past 10 years has been *completely* unfair. We, being an EU state, have discriminated against non EU countries when it comes to immigration. It's nationalistic. It should be meritocratic. It's only going to get worse when we have a government which is trying to lower immigration now someone has made noise about it. They are trying to shutdown non EU immigration.

&gt;*I'm completely pro-immigration. I don't apologise for this. I've got no issues with the immigrations rates of the last 10 years or so **and I'd be happy with more liberal agreements with other countries.***

I don't think that our immigration policies are very liberal.

&gt;*These people in Calais are completely abusing our system. **To get into this country you need to pass certain criteria.** Regardless of what that criteria is **it simply shouldn't be subverted by undertaking a criminal offence.***

&gt;***What kind of system would it be if we allowed in the criminals while turning away all those who did things completely by the book?***

There's only really a criteria for non EU citizens. EU citizenship can be given out indiscriminately. We, due to the lack of border control decided by Brussels, can not stop EU criminals from waltzing into this country. We are complaining about the wrong people as those criminals we let in by the book usually have done *a little more* than illegally migrating.

&gt;*And yes, I'm for an asylum system but (as has been frequently pointed out) these are not asylum seekers. If you are fleeing a country you would be willing to go anywhere, not just one particular country. The fact they are in France proves they have an affinity for Britain. They are running to Britain, not from their country of origin.*

&gt;*Frankly I'd be more than happy to see our troops in Calais. I don't think it's possible (Are the French really going to allow us to set up what would essentially be a base there?), but I'd vote for it if it was a possibility.*

I agree with the rest.

My point is that we should not apply the word fair to either side of the situation. We shouldn't let in criminals, but it is only hypocrisy to complain about it when we are already, legally, letting them through. That's the EU for us. That has been a decade's worth of immigration.

It may be cheaper but we have obligations under international law that would preclude us from doing that, and where would you suggest sending these people? Scratch anywhere in North Africa off the list, it's not stable. EU and international law says that once an asylum seeker or migrant is on european soil they can't be deported to a third country without proper legal proceedings. Maybe the government should set up an asylum hearing system (the US has immigration tribunals, but has a similar issue with illegal migration on the southern border). 

&gt;Now I'm thinking, maybe I should have just wandered into France 10 years ago and jumped a cargo truck at the border.
The EU should just pay some poor country to take these people in, they can start from the bottom like the rest of us. Why do they get a free ticket in to the best quality of life??

I'm not saying Yarmo can't or won't be a success were he to come to Spurs. I'm not even saying UPL can't produce talent. I'm saying that I'm less excited about this transfer rumor than the others we have seen recently because he's older so his ceiling is probably only a bit higher than his actual talent right now and because he's plied his trade in Ukraine exclusively so I can't quite say that he will find the same sort of success here. 

To be as objective as possible, Altidore also came from Eredivisie and I know that he flamed out so I'm not defending that league as fool-proof either. But in the comparison of objectively top leagues (Prem with Bera; Buli with the trio) I am less excited about Yarmo.",null,0,null,1438441648,null,null,false,0,ctnxzam,null,t3_3fdvxe,null,null,null,t1_ctnxs9v,null,null,null,1440219747,null,5,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

null,null,IScreechYourWeight,null,null,null,"Here are some thoughts. I'm not a lawyer or any sort of expert, just trying to help, so if anyone else can improve on this by all means do... anyway this is what I'd do:

... firstly don't let it bring you down too much, it will pass. I'd say the most important thing at this stage is not to let matters escalate. If you can do that, with any luck this'll all be sorted out in a few months. The Social have got bigger problems than you. Don't let the social services put you in the same box as those ones! That means deal with them patiently and politely, even if you *could* understandably get angry or upset with them.

Keep in mind that this isn't about getting justice, or fairness, or assuaging your being aggrieved. It's about sorting the mess out and getting everything nice and stable for your family.

The trouble is that these problems pile up into a big unsolvable heap unless you separate them out:

My suggestion would be in the first instance to arrange a meeting with the head of your son's (previous) school. Be assertive (but scrupulously polite), don't be fobbed off with a phone call or a secretary, you've got a perfectly valid reason to see them and you're entitled to arrange to do so at a mutually convenient time. That might mean waiting a week or two. They probably *will* be away on leave for most of the summer holiday. That's allowed. 

When you get to see them, go in knowing exactly what you *want* to get out of the meeting, which is that they contact your (regular) social worker directly, and discuss the attendance record thing, making it clear to the Social that your son is not a truant or neglected, but has kind of slipped through the cracks, records-wise. Explain the knock-on effect this has had regarding your housing etc. Give the teacher the social worker's name and phone numbers (and vice versa). Let them sort it out as two professionals. Remember it's not the teacher's responsibility to sort out your front door! Focus on the misleading attendance record, and that the school needs to discuss this fact with your social worker.

Not sure what power the social services have to make it mandatory for your daughter to attend nursery. Maybe someone else will advise you on this... but in the absence of other info I'd suggest at the very least speaking to the person who runs the nursery, and (again) if appropriate get them to speak directly to the social worker. If the social worker is still insisting on nursery attendance, ask them to recommend a suitable nursery for your new address. 

The broken down door is a totally different problem, and does sound infuriating, and being asked to pay for the lock really is taking the piss! I'd be furious about that, too, but in the circs, you've got to let it pass:  it's more in your interest to get things resolved sensibly, than get angry. Getting angry or upset with s.services or the police is *only* going to make things worse. 

From what you've said, it doesn't sound like you've broken the law in any way, and somebody else has damaged your landlord's property. This is tricky, because from what you've said it sounds like the social worker(s) have caused this problem by not phoning you. But insisting on this, and getting them to accept responsibility and pay for the damage, is going to put *them* on the defensive, which pretty much guarantees they're going to have to blame you, either to themselves or their superior if it comes to that. By standing up for yourself - to either the s. services or the police - regarding the door, is going to put you in the ""difficult bastard"" category, which is absolutely the last thing you want. 

So I suggest you concede defeat on that particular battle, because you're more interested in winning the war. Not ideal, I'm sorry, but what the hell. It's only a door, you're moving house anyway, sorting out a buggered door is going to be a piece of piss compared to extracting yourself from the ""difficult bastard"" box.

In the first place remove everything of great sentimental or cash value from the house, and rely on the crappy lock they've fitted for a few days if you absolutely have to. You've got t'internet: ebay / gumtree for a half-decent lock cheap. I realise you're not exactly flush; I'd suggest put off paying for the crappy lock they've fitted, until you've fitted a better one.  (B&amp;Q / hardware store bargain bins often have them if there's one key missing incidentally) Call in a favour from a mate who can fit it, or find a how-to online and do it yourself, how hard can it be? Answer: *hard* if you're living miles away and caring for your husband and two kids. But not impossible. Get the bits sorted out first, borrow a few tools, set aside a few hours for it and get someone to go over with you if you don't know one end of a screwdriver from the other. It can be done. A pain in the arse, that's not your fault, but an afternoon of embuggerance might save you months of being at loggerheads with a bureaucracy and a lot of lost sleep.

(I just noticed you say in your other reply the landlord is a nice bloke &amp; you don't want to let him down. Good; quite right. I had one of those, he let me owe him the rent, interest free, when I lost my job and was trying to start my own business! Paid him back in the end...! In that case, he may be willing to help you fit the lock himself, maybe get hold of one, ring him &amp; arrange to meet him there?)

Hope that helps - good luck. ",null,0,null,1438441883,null,null,false,0,ctny2xl,null,t3_3femd1,null,null,null,t3_3femd1,null,null,null,1440219794,null,21,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

If everyone nation in the world was broadly speaking ""developed"" in the same manner that every nation in the EU is developed I'd support completely doing away with the entire visa system.

As in all things you have to balance fairness and idealism with reality and I suppose that does mean I inevitable have to divide countries into ""prove your worth to get a visa"" and ""No visa required"" categories. I have no issue with any current EU states being in the latter category and, on top of that, anyone from the US, Canada, Australia, NZ, Japan, South Korea. Sadly (and however unethical it may be), I can't get behind allowing free movement between the UK and say, Nigeria, as this would simply swamp us with a massive, unsustainable number of economic migrants.

I say if we sign KdB and fail to sell at least one of Nasri/Navas and we get Rony to sign a new contract, we do this. Lyon is a great club with many great players who'll be competing for the Ligue 1 title and playing in the CL/EL.

Bayern do not worry about the teams in the Bundesliga and therfore making it easier for their players to be fit against clubs in the champions league. I have no idea what Bayern would be like in the premier league and you are now arguing hypothetically which you previously said not to do.. but whilst you are i might as well answer hypothetically too.

Bayern breezes the bundesliga like i previously said and every idiot with a working football knowledge knows that and it obviously affects the way they play in the champions league. SO *hypothetically* if they were in the premier league with our relentless barrage of difficult games coupled with NO christmas breaks Bayern would not be the super club in europe that they are and whether they would win the prem. Maybe? Maybe not? we will never know but I would back  Chelsea to win ANY league that spans over a season because we have the best manager in the world and we grind out results until the points stack up.

null,null,Blubbey,null,null,null,"&gt;Your argument was that they are troublemakers and/or hardly played under several managers. That's obviously incorrect.

My argument is several managers have repeatedly left them out - 35 games over 2 seasons for Kaboul is easily second choice partnership at best. Vert's played 74 games, Daws played 75 over his last 2 seasons for Spurs. 35 *is* being hardly played, he's not even played half as much as the other two first choices. Ffs Vlad played 24 games in 13/14 (Kaboul's most was 20 in 13/14), are you seriously telling me Vlad played a lot of games?

&gt; Don't know what you read. Adebayor has scored 12,30,16,14,13,18,8 and 14 in the last 8 seasons according to wikipedia.

However, scamera vans typically take a reading 20 or 30 metres away as you are heading directly towards them. Usually, these readings are taken from the rear of the vehicle. Look at the road geometry - you'll soon figure out if it's a scamera van if its rear was pointing down a long, straight bit of road and everyone was crawling past it. 

If it was a scamera van and you were caught, my defense would be I sped up at that point to protect my own life.

null,null,kde01,king,,null,"&gt; The season starts next weekend, and as far as I'm aware, the points start counting from then too.

The match at Old Trafford is just one match. If we're making a permanent transfer as quickly as possible and rushing a new player into the side for just one mach that's worse than just waiting to make the *right* transfer. 

&gt; I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that we'd have a decent CDM to go to Old Trafford with next weekend in the hopes of keeping Utd at bay. The fact that we just sold three of them without replacing any ahead of a really big opening game is foolish. I would rather have Stambouli and Capoue in the squad at this point than no one.

Capoue and Stambouli wouldn't have played that match, anyway. So the point is absolutely moot. They would have ridden the bench and only would have come on if there was an injury. For that I'd rather give Alli a shot. 

Capoue probably wouldn't have even made the bench.


&gt; And even if we somehow miraculously got Schneiderlin tomorrow, he still wouldn't be match ready to play in our first game. So if we narrowly lose next weekend by a single goal, you can't help but wonder if securing a quality CDM a few weeks ago might've made the difference.

That would be hard, seeing as he signed for United weeks ago.

I wouldn't worry about the first match of the season at OT against a very, very strong United side. It's a chance to showcase the passion and hard work we have in the squad. Even with a solid CDM we'd be at a significant disadvantage for that match.

I think a lot of fans are growing impatient. Many seem to think that we have the spending power and allure of Chelsea or United. We don't. We're trying to focus on building for the future while getting good players to give top 4 an honest shot this season. To succeed we can't just throw money at players that are good on paper and hope they can come good. We're not Chelsea, United, or City to be able to pull that off. We have to be very, very deliberate in our approach. And if that means taking a little too long and losing out on Moutinho and Schneiderlin I'm fine with it. I'm sure we all remember what happened when Pompey tried to do exactly what many of our fans are suggesting we do now. They fell apart. We need to avoid that same trap.

Look at the going day rates for contractors in your field.

Contractor day rates account for many things, it isn't as simple as salary minus pension. Risk of having no sick pay or holiday, opt out of working time regulations, skills required, shortage of those skills or not, location....

Generally, I expect a day rate ex VAT to be broadly double a salary/working days, but there's huge amount of flex. Not least because I'll be asking for more money before the salaried staff have pay reviews. 

Edit: also, rough guide, salaried employee expects to take home broadly 60% of salary, contractor pushing 80% of rate. Dependent on many things.

As other people have said, freshers week is a must (even if you don't want to buy the pass for the partying). You'll meet a lot of your cohort and hopefully some people from your course :) - In regards to sports, you can join the Sports Union and some teams during freshers week, so it's a good chance to meet people with similar interests. The same goes for your musical interest, all societies are hungry to get the freshers to join, so go along and sign up to any that take your fancy!

I do agree that halls is typically the best option for someone coming to Dundee for the first time, as you are pretty much as close to campus as possible. Looking for a room, it's probably worth looking on Gumtree like you said and jointing the university Facebook groups (such as Dundee University Computing Society, and your year might have a Facebook group already).

I am one of /u/DJFrankyFrank's least favorite people: a New York Red Bulls fan. My path here was a little different though. I've always followed the PL in a cursory manner, never too close and never any clubs in particular. Meanwhile, a coworker reconnected with an old friend about a year+ back in new york city; that man is now her husband. I got to know him pretty well because we both enjoy football. He is an Arsenal fan, but Bournemouth is his local club.

As the club continued to climb the league tables all the way to a clinching match against bolton for the championship, we discussed how amazing and improbable the whole thing is. The match against Bolton arrives and we are locked in at 2PM for some championship football in NYC.

Do you honestly think that Azpi is less attacking because of a limit to his skillset? Because, Azpi is VERY good at attacking. Do you know why he doesn't attack very much? It's to allow Hazard the attacking freedom that he needs and thrives in. ANY leftback that will come to Chelsea in the future and plays alongside Hazard WILL play in a subdued position to let Eden play to the best of his abilities.

null,null,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,null,"&gt; Do you have any other examples of people being described as a ""swarm""

It's part of my vocabulary (and therefore part of my social circle's vocabulary) so I hear it all the time--well, as often as it has a use.

&gt;It's dehumanising in the literal sense because you don't get swarms of humans

But you can. That's exactly my point. (EDIT: Hell, it's even [defined in the Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/swarm) as a large group of people--it's completely standard usage.) Sure, you wouldn't find the term used about humans in a nature text book but there's all sorts of language which also has a more restricted technical sense.

Ironically, the restricted technical sense is neutral not negative (it's not a bad thing when bees swarm) so any pejorative implication is something you're conjuring up in your own head. 

&gt;Equating groups with animals is a tired and tested way of dehumanising groups in order to numb sentimental feelings and empathy and enable cruel treatment 

What a load of SJW bollocks to think that's what's happening here. I personally have more empathy with the current plight of bees in our country (discussed recently on this sub) than I do with illegal immigrants so, if anything, using the word swarm to describe them is elevating.",null,0,null,1438445430,null,null,1438446122,0,ctnzocb,null,t3_3fcyfk,null,null,null,t1_ctnzc4d,null,null,null,1440220546,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Don't buy a new car; buy second hand even if its only 3 or 4 years old it might be in your budget; having said that don't be tempted to buy a classic car as you will not be able to insure it (with limited exceptions possibly being classic minis and VW Beetles but even then I would be wary).

Whatever car you buy make sure its not going to cost you a fortune in the near future from rust etc.

&gt;
&gt;The Second Doctor pilots the TARDIS as Jamie McCrimmon laments over the absence of their friend Victoria Waterfield. The Doctor reminds him that she's off studying graphology at the time. Wondering where they're going, Jamie is informed by the Doctor that the Time Lords are sending them on a mission to Space Station Camera in the Third Zone; they've also installed a teleport control on the TARDIS that grants them dual control. Showing the image of their destination to Jamie, the Doctor hears him compare its size to twenty castles. The Doctor explains to Jamie that the station is a research facility and they are here to have a discreet word with Dastari, the Head of Projects. The TARDIS materialises in the station kitchen, where they meet Shockeye, the station cook.
&gt;Shockeye berates the Second Doctor for landing in his kitchen.

Ive used words and explained myself while you've just used some made up scale that makes no more sense than the one that this whole thread is about.

Your putting a full back you'd probably never heard of this time last year one notch below Ivanovic. You've rated the best defensive full back in the league one notch above Monreal.

Terry was the best centerback in the league last year and the best england have had in my lifetime and hes one notch above Koscielny. I would at least have him two notches. Koscielny lacks leadership but he is a good player who would make it into our team, of  course it would be at the expense of our other defenders though, not Terry.

Walcott is a good player but we still don't know his best position and he's always injured half the season. Willian was integral to the identity of the side who won the league. In the first half of the season he was a key part of play, vacating his wing so Ivanovic could make use of the space all while always offering our players on the ball a good outlet to keep possesion ticking. In the second half of the season as Oscar began to tire he played games through the middle while continuing his insane efforts to get the ball back. His work rate and stamina are unbelievable.  
The way he got back into our defensive shape and worked his wing with Ivanocic was one of the main parts of our tactics. I bet you're one of the people who thought Cuadrado was going to come in and displace him from the side and add end product to our lineup and all of that.

Then you put Matic, arguably one of the best defensive midfielders in the world one notch ahead of a guy that arsenal had to recall from a championship side because of injuries to other players that were previously masquerading as holding midfield players. Coquelin did help Arsenal a lot as he's exactly what they have needed for about the last 5 years, a true defensive midfielder. He gave their attack minded midfielders license to do what they are actually good at. On the other hand I rate Matic only behind Busquets, though they are suited to completely different types of football. Simply put, there is no player who Barcelona could play instead of Busquets and improve their squad and the same applies to us and Matic. 

Arsenal have a good squad and will be even better this year but I think you're massively under rating some of our starting 11. It would be very hard for us to find a players who can perform better than our players at their specific roles in our system. Who do you get instead of Matic, Dave, Terry, Hazard, Oscar, and Willian? You might be able to replace Fabregas, Costa, and Courtois with other world class players but anyone comparable is going to come with an absolutely huge price tag.",null,0,null,1438447525,null,null,1438449301,0,cto0oen,null,t3_3fdq4g,null,null,null,t1_ctnsqk8,null,null,null,1440221084,null,1,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

null,null,domalino,1972crest,,null,"What a frustrating game. The 10 minutes before half time really killed the spectacle. We gifted Stuttgart 3 goals and then they were happy to just sit back and kill the game for the second half, as you'd expect. Here's some thoughts:

- Mangala and Denyaer works as a CB pairing. Not really sure why, but it does. Denayer knows how to play the Pellegrini system, he knows when to drop off and when to jump out. He seems to follow Mangala well, and they looked so much better together. 

- Vinny needs to be dropped. He simply cannot play if he's going to play like he did today. 

- Zuculini continues to look good, what the hell happened to him on loan? He looks a decent player and worth a spot in the squad at the moment. Evans on the other hand is nowhere near ready. 

- 2 assists for sterling who is looking great. 

- Iheanacho, Lopes (briefly) and Lopes were all great - I think they will definitely play big roles this season.  

- Bony looked good while he was on. Held up well and brought sterling into play nicely, especially the one time he put him through on goal. 

- Silva looked a bit out of sorts, grew into the game later on, but looked unusually flustered early on- possibly because Evans and Nasri gave him no options to pass to. Nasri cannot play in CM. It will not work. 

- Džeko got a farewell goal, which was nice. ",null,0,null,1438448285,null,null,1438448626,0,cto11ys,null,t3_3ff643,null,null,null,t3_3ff643,null,null,null,1440221260,null,33,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,33,null

null,null,VampyrByte,null,null,null,"With your first car, Definitly get something cheap, and used. You might crash it after 2 weeks, and if you buy a new car, or even spend £10k on a 2 or 3 year old car, you are going to be really out of pocket really fast.

There are many factors to consider, but consider how much you will be driving, will you be commuting, or just using it on weekends to get to the shops?

You really want to work out how much you need your car, how many miles a month? If it breaks down, what are your alternatives? Do you need it to get to work, or can you walk? 

If I'm making the assumption that you don't need a car at the moment, you just want one as you have passed your test, then this is what I would suggest.

Buy a car for less than £1000. But get the right car. The biggest cost with cars at this price, and your driving experience will be the insurance. Expect to pay more than £1000 for Insurance, but make sure to check and perhaps go for 3rd Party Insurance only. Fully comp is nice, but compare the difference in cost and make a judgement call. 

When I bought my first car, the extra cost for Fully Comp insurance was more than my car was worth - I could just buy another. Wasnt worth it.

Now, with this car. I don't want to say what kind of car you should get, but do some research, look into running costs, maintenance costs and that sort of thing and make a call. Whatever car you get will throw a curve ball at you. You can ignore those people who say you should get a Fiesta if you like, nothing to say they are right. 

Now, here is the thing. Now that you've got whatever car it is. Learn to look after it. Learn everything about this car. Check the oil (properly), Check coolant levels, keep an eye on absolutely everything. Tire pressures (and the spare!), tread depth (wear should be even across the whole tire, if its uneven there is likely a problem). You'll have spent £2k on the car and insurance, within 2 years, expect to spend another £1k maintaining it.

There is a fee to apply, but on the whole, tribunals more often side with the employee. Expect a payout of max a few thousand. (3k for someone I know sacked for getting pregnant)

To check if he has a claim, call one of those no-win-no-fee type firms.  If they are willing to take the case he probably has a chance, but I stress that he doesn't need to use their services or accept any offer they make.

I also wouldn't include Dier in this at all since he's not even remotely a DM and he's only been used in preseason. Difficult to say if he's actually seen as an option for that position now. I sure hope not. 

It's also important to note that not a single one of those players is the sort of anchor that Veljkovic is. Capoue comes closest but he's still pretty rangy and if anything his defensive weakness was tracking opponents. 

Veljkovic is more of a DM in the mold of Carrick or Busquets...doesn't run around much but takes up good positions in front of the back four, cuts out attacks, and lets the ball do the work for him. I don't think we've played with this sort of player for a minute under Pochettino, and the fact that 19 year old Veljkovic hasn't really got a sniff under him is concerning to me.

I just don't feel our manager has much tactical flexibility, which is something that the Southampton fans would probably agree with. When his ideas work, they are immense...our central midfield played really well in big games against Arsenal and Chelsea for example. But that same midfield got dicked around by teams like Stoke. His ideas are really not sustainable over a 50+ game season...sometimes you need a more defensive player who isn't all about pressing and covering ground.

Who is dealing primarily with these refugees? [Not the UK it seems.](http://i.gyazo.com/4f364d8367d93ac1126f4f4aaf4817cc.png)

I can't speak to the numbers that are economic migrants &amp; the numbers that are refugees (no one can, there are no figures on this). I can tell you the majority that claim asylum are genuine asylum seekers (over 50% in aggregate are approved, see Eurostat figures) &amp; I can tell you the largest groups trying to come here are from countries with very high asylum acceptance rates (such as Syria &amp; Eritrea with 94 &amp; 90% acceptance in first instance asylum decisions, see Eurostat &amp; Frontex figures). 

I agree with you we should be funding more camps in neighbouring countries. I think we should be pushing more for an alternative solution to simply accepting them all here, as I don't believe the people want this &amp; it's not a viable solution. However, until a solution is found we should be doing our fair share in accepting refugees, which we're not at the current time. Other EU countries are far more burdened than we are for conflicts they weren't even involved in. In short we should be accepting more now, and looking into somewhere else we can send them at the first possible opportunity, which we will fund. I don't like the current government approach simply saving people &amp; then leaving the responsibility of dealing with them up to Italy. I don't think dealing with the smugglers is the right approach either, that doesn't solve the base problem here, it just means less refugees will be able to get to safety. You can solve the smuggler problem right now by dealing with asylum claims from outside the EU, but we don't want to do that as it would mean accepting more refugees. We're also not doing enough to help neighbouring countries, for instance refugees are costing [Lebanon billions per year](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-refugees-soon-third-lebanon-population-un-1494368866) with very little help from Western governments.

Chain:

&gt;&gt;***don't look at ukip** or britain firsts **facebook page only fill you with disgust***

&gt;***I'd imagine both of those pages would fill me with disgust mostly any day of the week.***

I admit. I'm wrong in that you didn't say you find UKIP disgusting. You only confirmed such views on an unstated element of their Facebook outlet. I jumped to the conclusion that you didn't like UKIP without considering individuality. I'll rephrase:

Why would you imagine the UKIP Facebook page to ""fill [you] with disgust mostly any day of the week""?

Is it a general attitude to UKIP supporters or is it the case to a noisy few special to Facebook? Is it neither? Is it the publications or/and the reception? Is it something else?

&gt;&gt;*I don't find democracy all that repulsive.*

&gt;***Are you implying that I do?***

I jumped the gun in accusing you off disliking UKIP without consideration to special circumstance. This is dependent on the previous assertion. Are your views individual to Facebook?

I make the point on democracy because UKIP is, very arguably, the party for far reaching democratic reform. They have been the key player in promoting both national and continental sovereignty, accountability and, in general, libertarian values. To suggest disgust with UKIP, which I wrongly asserted by association, is to suggest disgust with their values in which democracy lies at heart. I would, if you like, develop the case on democracy if you disagree or are unsure.

&gt;&gt;*It isn't fair to put Britain First and UKIP in the same sentence.*

&gt;*Why not?*

My comment is tailored to the comment there. Of course you can compare. I was meaning they shouldn't be compared in such a manner as initially expressed.

I don't think it's fair to so narrowly draw similarity as it would make them, being undeveloped, seem interchangeable. It's promoting conflation which is inaccurate. Britain First is fundamentalist, nationalistic and more of a social movement while UKIP is patriotic, liberal, libertarian and all politically, socially and economically motivated. The only thing they have in common is Euroscepticism in which is for different reasons. Keep in mind that BF's ex BNP while UKIP is not. UKIP's largely cross spectrum with the exception of extremist groups which are prohibited by constitution.

His head teacher knows the situation, we spoke to him and the attendance officer but they decided to involve s.s. instead of being helpful.  Hes going to a different school next month when we move anyway. 


The situation with the nursery is difficult because s.s. made an action plan that we have to follow or we will go to court and could lose our children.  In the action plan it says my daughter must attended nursery twice a week. Im terrified that if we don't take her s.s. will take the kids.

I have already replaced the lock because 1. It was flimsy and 2. I needed to break into my own home to collect the valuable stuff and all of our paperwork.  I replaced it with a much tougher lock but we still cant live there. Theres no way to lock or even close the door because they took all of the insides of the door out. Also I do fear that the kids on the estate (really bad behaved) will lock us in as a 'prank'.

Our stand in social worker did say they would pay for it but they dont have funding. Thats got to mean they're admitting fault right? 
I do think that the head of department and our social worker would disagree with what this social worker and the police have done. I just have to wait until our social worker gets back.


I do understand what you are getting at by saying not to fight because I did say no to the nursery place because it would add extra work onto my already busy days. They then said I was refusing to cooperate with them.
The problem is that im scared to let them get away with it because then they'll think that they CAN get away with it and what will they do next? Will they do it again? When will they stop doing this to innocent people?

&gt; These red Thatcherites have ruled the roost over the Labour Party for two decades now, and in my opinion their time is up. Blairism won three general elections in a row, but just think about the hopelessness of the opposition at the time. Tony Blair beat John Major's tired and sleaze ridden Tory government, then he beat William ""Billy Fizz"" Hague's Tories with a smaller majority in 2001, then his majority shrank again when the Tories inexplicably chose Michael ""something of the night"" Howard as their leader for the 2005 General election. It's now ten years since Blairism won a General Election, yet the Blairites keep insisting that Labour needs to move even further to the right, and even deeper into Tory territory in order to win again.

I can't see anyone of the top 4 failing this year.

**Username:** /u/josh_fraser17        
**Original Post:**          
Im selling my amazing CPU cooler - the Dark Rock Pro 2 from Be Quiet.

This cooler is amazing with a great ratio of sound to performance.

It comes with all the included mounting hardware, the cooler itself,  1 x 120mm and 1 x 135mm Silent Wings fan and instructions. All in original box.

At max speed this cooler only gives of a sound level of 26.4 dB which is pretty much silence.

Cooler is near new condition as it hasnt really been used that long.

Can achieve amazing OC with it whilst still having a silent system.

Price - £45 plus postage (will work out at the time)

Grab a great cooler!

See below. I responded point by point. 

&gt;Sorry I can't respond as fully as I would like but my point was that the ideology behind many of the policies you suggested is still on the right. That they have broader more centrist appeal I don't argue, but that they are perceived as such is more to do with the marketing than the realities.

Market economics/neo-liberalism is the center. You may disagree, but that is the reality and it has been since the 80s. 

You are conflating two separate lines of argument here. We can discuss factual realities separate from whether those factual realities are a good or a bad thing. i.e. We can say that robberies happen, but saying that robberies happen is not the same thing as saying ""robberies are good (or bad)."" The question of value is separate from the question of existence.

null,null,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,null,"&gt;but time is limited

But it's still ***huge***. A few thousand years of travelling time and space is *nothing* in the scope of the billions and billions of years the universe has been around.

Let's not forget space. A lot of people forget that [space is big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwhQB3TKXA) [Really really big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDtKcvGcOo). Even with a lifespan measuring in the thousands of years, even if you visited one planet every second of your life, you wouldn't even begin to approach a millionth of a percent of millionth of a percent of all the planets out there. That's just space: Multiply that by time, by every second, every minute from the beginning to the end, and you have an idea of the mind boggling vastness of what the Doctor meant when he said ""anywhere in time and space"".

So no, it's highly unlikely he would ever accidentally run into himself. Future incarnations would know to stay out of the way of previous ones, which wouldn't be very hard considering the scale on which the Doctor travels. 

He has purposely met with his other incarnations, as others have said.

null,null,IScreechYourWeight,null,null,null,"&gt; The situation with the nursery is difficult because s.s. made an action plan that we have to follow or we will go to court and could lose our children. In the action plan it says my daughter must attended nursery twice a week. Im terrified that if we don't take her s.s. will take the kids.

Bloody hell, that's awful. Surely the action plan was based on your circumstances at the time - specifically, living where you were. There has been a huge change in circumstances. Therefore the action plan has to be reconsidered. If they're making an inflexible action plan that doesn't get revised in the light of changing circumstances, surely that's a failing on their part?

TBH I'm now thinking your best course may be looking at the legality of (a) their categorising your child as ""absent from school"", and (b) the legal standing of their ""action plan"" and any sanctions that might arise from it. 

As others have said, CAB is a very good idea. See if they can find someone to act as an advocate on your behalf with social services, in the first instance. 

I like the idea of waiting for your main social worker to get back, if at all possible (I appreciate this may be stressful in the meantime). It's in everyone's interest - yours, theirs, the taxpayers - to avoid going to court if at all possible.

One constructive thing to do, while you wait, is to do some documentation on your own account: write down the key factors, as you've described them here - the lateness, the reasons for the lateness, the extent of the lateness; who was spoken to at the school and SS, what their response was; dates everything happened (including the door being smashed) and so on. Having all those facts at your fingertips could be a huge help. You will also feel better for getting it all down and making sense of it on paper, believe me. 

Also take a copy of your ""action plan"", which is presumably a written agreement somewhere (or it's not going to be enforceable) and make notes on what has been complied with, anything that's not, and the bits that are difficult due to your change of circumstances. Where possible, note down things you could do, or efforts you have made, to comply with it, and ways you'd suggest the plan be modified.

That way, when your regular social worker is back, you can send them a nice, long, extraordinarily polite and well-written letter, setting out all of this. You want it to show them - and their boss - exactly how seriously you're taking the situation, and the efforts you've been to to sort stuff out. 

If you *do* ever end up in a court situation, or taking proper legal advice, all that writing down of times, names, dates etc. is going to be a huge factor in your favour, as is evidence that you attempted to sort the problems out in good time (which is exactly what you are doing). But my real reason for suggesting all this documentation is that it will actually make it *less likely* that they'll take you to court. Because you'll be able to show evidence of attention to detail and your own efforts to solve problems under your own steam - and the exact details of their own failings - there's much less chance of them seeing it as a ""winnable"" case, or of there being a public interest justification for pursuing it. 

I work in an entirely different area, nothing at all to do with social services, but in my career I've had jobs where I had to gather evidence with a view to prosecuting people (think industrial regulations). I can assure you that taking you to court is absolutely the *last* thing your social worker or their organisation wants to do. Taking people to court takes a vast amount of time, money and hassle. Before you can get that far, they would have to gather enough evidence to support their case, which is arduous; they would have to demonstrate that the public interest is served in pursuing the case. I'm pretty confident social services don't ever *want* to do that, unless they seriously believe a child is at risk (in which case fair enough!). 

In your case I expect the threat of court action (and all that may follow) is mainly the means of getting people to take the ""action plan"" seriously - which you clearly are - and not something they'd resort to unless absolutely every other avenue had been tried to reach a resolution.

You're trying to reach a resolution already, so good for you. Assuming you've given us a fair picture of the situation, and I've absolutely no reason to doubt that, you're *morally* in the right place with this, and in fact have good cause to be aggrieved at the actions of social services. It sounds like you've already got the moral high-ground. Keep it. 

I still stand by what I said earlier about not being in the ""difficult sod"" box (or however I phrased it). On any level, getting your door smashed in sounds like a serious misjudgement on their part, to put it mildly, and if someone did it to me I'd be furious. But I think there's a risk here that by complaining - which you've every right to do - you'd put at least one idiot in the position of justifying actions which could demonise their organisation. In an ideal world they'd put their hands up, admit fault, apologise, replace the door &amp; buy you a bunch of flowers. But I think it's much, much more likely to be someone who'd instead try to avoid a reprimand at work by justifying their actions, which in turn means making a credible case for being concerned about child safety, which in turn means painting a bleak picture of you! So - I hate to say it - but I'd suggest letting the matter of the door go. But - in case it comes up in future - make sure you've written down exactly who did and said what, and when. 

Courts, judges, and solicitors, put great value in contemporaneous notes of stuff happening. It *always* scores better than remembering it weeks or months later, which would immediately be challenged by the other side. Get it all written down! It's the only advice I've given you that I'm 100% sure of!

Coutinho looked rusty, understandably. 

Both Henderson and Milner made a lot of poor decisions I felt, but were otherwise solid. 

Ings ran well but as all of pre season, didn't take his chances unfortunately. Origi looks more likely to score at the moment. 

Skyrtle was on top of everything defensively, always in the right place. Clyne linked well with Ibe too. 

Chivellera I am quite excited by too. He only played ten minutes but the way he walks around looking over his shoulders and making simple passes says to me he is smart enough to play that holding role.

null,null,ThatBiscuit,null,null,null,"I don't know where you plan to study so I can't help too much there unless you reveal more. If you need accommodation though, I studied at University of Birmingham for 4 years (MEng CS). UoB have the student village ""The Vale"" specifically for UoB students - and they help during the application process to find something. There is also Selly Oak houses / Victoria Hall / Liberty Court / The Beeches  - again I'd say more aimed at if you're planning on going to UoB.

However, I lived close to the city centre on *Bath Row* through my studies in halls - afraid I can't help if you want a flat of your own, but people there were from BCU/UoB/UCB, interesting dynamic when some are doing vocational stuff/music and others are doing mech eng etc. 


There are three student accommodations right next to each other there: *Liberty Living* (shared flats/shared flats w/ensuite) - they're okay, they recently refurbished the social room and I stayed for 3 years which is some endorsement.
There is *iQ* over the road which offer private rooms and shared flats - some of my friends liked it there, and then there is *The Pavilion* which got built in my second year - don't know anyone who went there. I did a stint at *Studio 51* for a summer position, though it cost a bit more. Overall they're all about the same IMHO. 

What's good about the location is that:
a) if you drive, then at Liberty Living you can park there, for a fee when I was there, but still be pretty close to the city centre
b) you have a social room so you can get to know people where you live from different backgrounds/colleges/courses not just on campus
c) you can hop on a train (Fiveways) and get to city centre (New Street) or UoB campus in about 5 minutes in the other direction.
d) for a night out in the city centre it was so much nicer to just stumble/walk back through the mailbox than have to go back to Selly Oak.
e) Gatecrasher/Pubs (Broad Street) / Tescos/Morrisons / Broadway Plaza/Casino are just around the corner/up the road and there is a petrol station right next to there.
f) the entrance to the canal is right next to the shell garage so you can run/cycle/walk along the canal - and its not a dodgy one, I've been told they've also resurfaced the paths recently (it leads to the city centre via Slug + Lettuce sort of direction or towards UoB/Selly Oak/Bournville)

Most of this match looked eerily familiar to most of the matches last season, BUT I am hoping the the new signings will be the catalyst that pushes us from dropping points to winning points. Milner was involved in both goals. 

Milner fits.  He looks so far to be a perfect match for this squad, and with the exception of Coutinho, I don't see anyone else in the squad that is better. 

This summer's window appears to be exponentially better than last year's. Milner, of course. Clyne and Gomez will be solid. Benteke and Firmino may be what this team needs in order to unlock these annoying teams that play behind the ball for 90 minutes. I am very satisfied with our new signings.

Ings is a player that I think needs to improve a lot, he reminds me a bit of Borini, he runs at 100% after everything but he lacks control. His first touch was poor at times today, he lost out on chances because his touch was heavy on a few occasions.

Gomez looked decent, he's solid defensively but doesn't offer as much offensively as I've seen others suggesting. There were a couple of occasions were he could have played a nice through ball or tried to take on his man, but he just played a safe pass back more often than not.


I think the sub needs to calm down with their hype of certain players, Gomez and Ings are still young and have plenty of time to improve. But as of now, they shouldn't be starters because they aren't good enough, so lets give them time to develop instead of hyping them up.

There is a lot of info about introducing and layering actives in /r/AsianBeauty (and I'm pretty sure the same is true of SCA), as it's pretty vital to place acids (AHA and BHA) and vitamin C in the correct order in your routine due to product pH, so you should read about that. Some actives also require a waiting time before moving on to the next step of your routine, or they become ineffective. 

You haven't mentioned using any moisturisers, which could be part of the problem, as you may have dehydrated oily skin, where the skin lacks water/moisture, so compensates by producing too much oil. I used to think that having oily skin meant I needed to use drying, harsh products, but actually using moisturising products has made a huge difference in oil production. I know some actives can be quite drying, so that could be part of your problem. I believe moisturising well, along with the addition of regular and proper AHA and BHA application, has reduced my oil production and cut down the number of break outs I get greatly. There are some really good moisturiser recommendations in the sidebar under Review Topics.

Also, always introduce new products one at a time so that you can figure what is helpful and what is harmful to your skin. I can't help much more with your specific routine as I don't think I'm knowledgable enough and have never used benzoyl peroxide, but I think you'll find a great deal of info already posted here and in the other subs.

Weeeeel, yes and no. The US produces far more shit throwaway TV than anyone else in the world, and more than they produce quality stuff. But we get a disproportionate amount of their quality offering because that's what sells overseas. A bit like Doctor Who selling around the world, but not Cash in the Attic.

Breaking Bad, The Wire are nowhere near the most popular anything in the US. They are very good, and have a critical acclaim, but not really popular.

The most popular drama in the US is NCIS. Before that, it was CSI. The most popular sitcom has been The Big Bang Theory for a few years now.

British TV is admired by US TV creators, in that we have more variety. In the schedules where they get to put 22 episodes of NCIS spread over 39 weeks, we have seven dramas. We also produce far more original content as a percentage. Networks will air an entire week of repeats every couple of months, and most shows run on a cycle of three new episodes, one repeat, three new episodes...

However, simply being 'associated' with another person can sometimes affect a credit profile. 'Association' could be as little as living in the same property as someone else. So it's possible that information related to you being added as a cardholder might have been passed into the credit referencing system somewhere, which could result in you and your girlfriend being connected.

Due to differences in cost of living between our two countries it would be relatively cheap for us to help them, and much cheaper overall than hosting refugees here (costing hundreds of millions of pounds per year). 

With regards to the UK, well it's all about perspective isn't it. The standard of living for an unemployed person, disabled person, or refugee living in Britain is far higher than those living in Lebanon or Jordan. We're making cuts, but the impact of those cuts is tiny in comparison to what many people in those countries have to live with. A little money can go much further there than it does here, that's the key point to realise I think. 

EDIT: Another point to make, instead of getting embroiled in yet another conflict in Syria (which is what DC seems to want to do), how about we donate the potential [10s or 100s of millions](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/26/business/uk-iraq-airstrikes-cost/) that will cost to helping house refugees instead?

They are being kept in a place nicknamed 'the jungle' in horrific conditions. This idea that they're 'economic migrants' as David Cameron keeps saying is absolute bollocks, every country in the EU has taken more migrants because of the influx from Syria (where the majority are coming from) yet we're acting like they're not our problem.

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"Oh no police are superheroes. The first term of reception class at his school had the topic of super heros. They based their reading and writing on superheroes and got to meet real superheroes. His understanding of the emergency services is that theyre all superheroes who save lives but the police save us from all the bad guys.  He knows to go to them for help because they will save you/help you and get the bad guys away. He has told me to phone the police before when an argument left me in tears. He thought they would put the other person in time out for being bad and save me. 

Its really cute but I think the way his school handled it at such a young age is amazing. He really does believe theyre superheroes and when we pass police in the street its like hes seen a celebrity. We have lots of photos that awesome people from the emergency services have taken with him. Obviously they weren't busy at the time and some where at shows but he loves to chat to them and they're always happy to see how amazed he is by them. 


As for the other part of your reply I do agree education is very important especially at his age when hes getting the foundations down. I do struggle to prioritise the way they want me to though. Its hard walking out of the house in the morning knowing that my husband is stuck in bed alone without any help. The days I take my daughter to nursery are the hardest because he is alone for 2 hours in the morning.

So let us look at what appears to be your favorite relationship in modern football: Lee and Ramos. I have no idea why you insist that Ramos loved this guy so much. So let us look at the facts here:

If a manger has two right-backs and a 19 year old central-midfieler he prefers to use over you in your position (which is left-back mind you), you are frozen out of the team. It  is not as Poch has been starting Kyle Walker over Capoue in his position.

As much as Corbyn's appeals to utopian socialism are great and all, he doesn't actually have the policies to back it up other than ""I will spend more"" and some stuff about renationalising rails. I'd also like to hark back to the fact that not only is one of the biggest reasons we lost this year because the media inaccurately portrayed Ed as a radical socialist (electing an actual radical socialist is a sure vote-winner), but the public associates Old Labour socialism with things like the Winter of Discontent and double digit inflation. 

Burnham on the other hand is now advocating rail renationalisation, so Corbyn's only good policy is now no longer unique to him, and as someone else has explained much better, Burnham is supporting the Land Value Tax, which is a wholly new egalitarian idea with a lot of support from major economic academics across the political spectrum that has yet to be put into practice. Plus, Burnham would actually keep the party unified as the Labour left will hop behind his more left-wing policies, while the Labour right will find him moderate enough to satisfy their tastes.

Oh, and Corbyn has a history of utter insanity such as apologising for Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA, and openly backing things like giving Northern Ireland back to the Irish and claiming the Falklands are Argentinian. Im sure those'll go down just great with the British public when the media constantly wheels them out come election time, because you know, people are just clamouring for a politician who understands how wrong and evil we were when Argentina invaded the Falklands, and when the IRA were detonating bus bombs killing innocent civilians in London.",null,0,null,1438456895,null,null,1438457111,0,cto5eao,null,t3_3fey9j,null,null,null,t3_3fey9j,null,null,null,1440223307,null,6,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

null,null,JimmothyTwinkletoes,null,null,null,"Dude, Saying Bony was bad because he was at Vitesse and Swansea isn't really that valid of a point. Zabaleta was at Espanyol before came here. Should we not have tried to get him because he wasnt at Barcelona or Juventus? Fernandinho was at Shakhtar Dontesk. Should we not have gotten him because he never played for PSG or Real Madrid? Kompany played for Hamburger. Should we have not bought him because he wasn't Bayern's captain? 

What I've seen from Bony was a unmatched ability to use his body as leverage and lean on defenders to keep possession and his ability in the air, which is also unmatched in our team. Bony is also probably the only true target man in our team.

He looked bad-ish today for the same reason our defense looked bad. Our midfield was getting overrun and we couldn't hold possession long enough to get anything going until Nasri came off for Zuculini, which coincidentally was the same time Iheanacho came on for Bony. If we started a midfield that wasn't made up of players out of position than he probably would have looked fine. I can't recall him having any bad misses or cheaply giving up possession during a promising attack today. Those are more indicative of a striker's performance than who he played for before coming her, which means next to zero to me. 

I never down voated you either, because you're not trolling, just disagreeing with other posters about Bony.

null,null,Antsonfire,num18,,null,"&gt;I've seen a better history of players who have performed from Eredivisie than UPL

Because the Ukranian league is like twenty years old. Only when Shaktar's Brazilian adventures started have they turned out to be pretty decent. To give you a few examples of big moves, Douglas Costa moved to Bayern straight from Shaktar. Mikhitaryan went straight from Shaktar to Dortmund. Luis Adriano is going to be leading the line in a rejuvenated Milan side, and there's of course Willian and Fernandinho in England. 

&gt;I'm not sure where you get the sense that Eredivisie is a weaker league than UPL

Ukraine has a stronger coefficient in Europe than the Netherlands. You would think that although Ajax can't really compete in the CL given their usual groups (one of Madrid/Barca, and PSG) they'd try to make a go of it in Europa, but they haven't done too well there. On the other hand, Shaktar regularly makes it to the knockout rounds while Dnirpo beat a strong Napoli side on their way to the Europa final. 

&gt;but I would have to disagree in terms of the sheer talent that you see coming from that league (Depay, Alderweireld, Suarez, Zlatan, VDV, Huntelaar, Sneijder are just a few you should recognize).

The problem with this list is that the people in it are*decades* apart and also differ in how big of a jump they made from the Eredivisie to elsewhere. Look at Sneidjer and Ibra. They moved to Juve and Madrid right out of Ajax and did well for themselves (I think Sneidjer would've been a cult hero for Real along with Robben if they didn't get of their Dutch contingent). 

Suarez and Toby are significantly different from them. Suarez needed three seasons before he became the machine that he is at Liverpool. He wasn't always world class and only under Rodgers did he flourish in England. Toby couldn't cut it in Atleti's defense and had to take a step down to Southampton and now us. 

For now the best Eredivisie players are making the same kinds of moves or even inferior moves that the players from the Ukraine are making. For every Eriksen and Depay that comes out of the Netherlands, there's always an Anita or Luuk De Jong, players who just don't work out at bigger clubs. 

On top of all this, he's not ancient. 26 might be all there is to him, but you're giving off the vibe that he's 34, coming out of his prime and looking for a last big payday. I get that the youth thing is in full swing right now, but it's not the end all and be all to a player.

Take it one step back: Some people I cycle with have criticised me for shouting a warning when cars have passed too close. They don't think it does anything at all and is essentially pointless. They've come close to saying that if anything happens to me then it's going to be my ""fault"" for being vocal at motorists.

Why is following a driver for a conversation 'worse' than hitting their vehicle?

People forget, but Eriksen played CM most of the time at Ajax, as they were very attached to the philosophy. He was fantastic there too, played very much like Cazorla's new role at Arsenal. Lamela excelled on the right of a narrow 433 at Roma, and that formation allowed him to drift behind the striker without clogging the center of the field.

In the years since Redknapp left, and took his 442/451 with him, I've always felt our squad acquisitions were well suited for a Barcelona-esque 433, maybe not as much total football but with similar players in similar roles. Especially under AVB I thought it would come to fruition, as he used the formation at Porto with great results. The 3-1 comeback against Man City I thought would be the turning point, as the formation allowed us to dominate the midfield and throw our wingers (especially leftie Bale on the right) at the gap between the fullback and CB.

Now with Poch, a Bielsa disciple, I doubt the 433 comes to White Hart Lane, unless he has a massive shift in philosophy. One of Bielsa's favored formations, and Poch's certain favorite, is the 4231. Still, I imagine if we got a great DM, we would be immediately ready to field a 433, and IMO get the best out of our players doing it.

That's not a reason to not do it, but depending on where you're going to study, you could find yourself discovering that physics isn't quite as exciting as Brian Cox would have you believe.

Physics at uni would require you to learn programming regardless, so you can't run away from that aspect of it. Have you ever tried modelling the gravity of Jupiter on an orbital body? Well, to do that, you need to program.

Physics I think would be more difficult than Computer Science. Physics requires you to understand what's going on - if you don't, you'll crash and burn. CompSci is nice, you can google what's wrong.

If you're really not sure about it, I'd say consider deferring for a year - take a gap year and figure out what you really want to do. Maybe do A Level Physics in your spare time? It wouldn't count for anything, but you'd at least have an idea of what to expect. Get a job at a computer company or something. Figure out what makes you tick.

The RAF killed 300,000 civilians during bombings of Berlin. 300,000? Only around 5000 people died total during the Troubles from all sides. The exact reason you would call the IRA terrorists people would call the British army heroes? Don't get me wrong the British army during WWII were definitely heroes, my annoyance comes from people turning around and calling the IRA terrorists for doing the same thing? I know you said nobody calls the Brits heroes but nobody calls them terrorists either. By your logic as the British army spilled the blood of innocent people as well then they are terrorists to? You don't think the devastation they caused in Berlin was as terrifying as it was in Belfast? Is celebrating them a 'fucking disgrace'? 


The word is a joke. It has no meaning, it's just used as a biased way to describe the 'other side'. The guys who dare shoot back at us while we're shooting at them. The IRA caused terror in the North absolutely but every single military force that has ever existed has spread terror. That's why I say repeatedly I would not mind calling the IRA terrorists for their actions,  if you think war is a violent, inhumane thing from a pacifist standpoint and think anyone who takes part in it is a terrorist then fine, I 100% agree with you in every way. The IRA were terrorists, case closed. But then I would also call the British army terrorists for the murders they have done. The US army. Every single army needs to be painted with the same brush for the same crimes instead of picking and choosing who is a terrorist and who is a hero. 


I know you said nobody would call the British army heroes, but have you ever heard the British army during the troubles labelled as terrorists? Because that's where I get annoyed.

I'm not sure whether you're in a position to pay for legal advice or not, but you're best placed to get advice from a solicitor practicing in 'community care'.

Though Legal Aid is sometimes still available for specific community care matters (obviously depends on whether you qualify financially too) there have been significant cuts.

However, I think the best place to seek advice from is the housing charity Shelter, who also have some capacity to give community care advice for free. They're ideal in your case because you will be able to get advice about your housing too.

Best of luck with this.

No, they are not being kept there against their will, stop lying. There is nothing stopping them from leaving and heading south. 

&gt;This idea that they're 'economic migrants' as David Cameron keeps saying is absolute bollocks, every country in the EU has taken more migrants because of the influx from Syria (where the majority are coming from) yet we're acting like they're not our problem.

Holy shit the propaganda truly has taken hold. How many people from Syria are black? Seriously? Are these from Syria?

The majority are NOT Syrians. Besides, why do we have to take refugees from Syria? It's not our problem, we're thousands of miles from it.

&gt; ""economic migrant"" is a typical Cameron buzzword, it doesn't mean anything, someone coming from poverty to a better life in another country is an 'economic migrant' somehow that term is used to dehumanise these people.

That is exactly what an economic migrant is, congratulations. They're not fleeing some war torn dictatorship, they're moving here because of benefits and a better average life. They think they'll be given a house when they arrive (they probably will).

Money gathered Supreme Leader would then enact laws / issue decrees for the following:

Legalise weed. Tax it. Make Belfast the new Amsterdam. Let bars decide when to close. Pump tax money from weed, alcohol and increased tourism into schools and education. Ban cars from Belfast, make it fully pedestrianised with tram system. 

Start using digital currencies along with sterling and euros. Ban all flags and emblems. Ban all paramilitary displays and marching. All organisations that are exclusive to one religion are banned - Orange Order, Hibernians etc. 

Make all schools fully integrated. Science, technology and languages are compulsory. No more segregated housing estates and ghettos. Government homes to be mixed with privately-owned. Families in government owned houses moved until balanced neighbourhoods - mixed religion and class are created.

Create a local defence force - everyone, including prisoners, must do one year of service. If people fuck around they don't get an asbo they get another year of service. Force will be used in times of civil disaster or for peacekeeping duty. 

Prisoners are made to work - producing goods for tourists, fixing the roads, cleaning streets, repairing shit. Money goes into their rehabilitation and training.

Ensure we are run close to 100% on renewable energies like wind, tidal and solar. All new cars must be electric. Everyone is given a house battery. All roofs fitted with solar panels.

Everyone is given a basic income (on top of what you may earn privately). Everyone must work unless disabled. Those unable to find jobs work on government jobs rebuilding the infrastructure - road building, home building or otherwise employing a new skill they've been taught. They only get their basic income but get a raise if they learn new skills to help integrate back into the workforce.

Hire experts in the fields of the economy, science, education, justice, transport and arts etc. Government is made of up of scientists, doctors, teachers and people who know their shit instead of elected idiots. 

Install them as the new government on performance-based contracts. They don't perform then they get the fuck out and are replaced.

This will still be rare though as most would have been bought for kids and kicked about until they faded away (like mine) and the team you have is from our top years. Someone would definitely like this! Great find :)

Anelka's fascist/extreme right comedy buddy that invented it, did it to avoid legal ramifications when discussing the ""Jew-question"". 

The anti-establishment, that Ekotto rests his defense on, is anti-legal protection for Jewish people in France. That is, the gesture is developed to avoid legal penalties for taking part in hate-speech aimed at Jewish people.

So, with no legal recourse, Ekotto was demoted to the reserves, hoping he would move to a different club. But, as Ekotto has admitted repeatedly, he is only in it for the money. He was more than happy basically doing as little as possible for 40k a week. It is starting to look similar with Lennon too, I doubt he will move anywhere on lower wages.

First of all Lambert has just gone to West Brom, Coates has gone to Sunderland (where he was loaned to last season), Glen Johnson's Liverpool career has ended with him now joining Stoke City on a free transfer and Andre Wisdom has joined Norwich on loan for the year.

I think the Brad Jones has also left the club on a free transfer but is yet to have found a club to take him on yet.

So now onto the signings Liverpool have brought into the club, the first signing which was made by us was to bring in Man City midfielder James Milner in on a free transfer to bring in some experience for the team with Steven Gerrard's departure.

Now James Milner isn't the only free transfer Liverpool have brought into the team for the season, Danny Ings has come in from Burnley (but LFC will have to pay a fee to Burnley thanks to his age) and Adam Bogdan is in too replace Brad Jones as our professional bench warmer.

And we've also continued our raiding of Southampton this season with us completing the signing of Nathaniel Clyne coming in to be our new right back for a fee of £12.5m.

Money hasn't exactly been a problem for us in this transfer window with the club busting the bank on Brazil international Roberto Firmino and paying Aston Villa's release clause for their star striker Christian Benteke for a combined fee of £60.5m

Everyone has now just agreed that our signing of Joe Gomez from Charlton to be the best signing the club has ever made with him being the best player in the world and all.

I think that's been all of our business which has happened so far, but don't expect to see it over yet, with people like Fabio Borini and Jose Enrique still at the club, they could be on the way out to find new homes.

So, Liverpool's pre season got off to a flying start in their pre season campaign by beating the Thai All Stars 4-0 to win the True Super Trophy in the first match of the tour with goals coming from Markovic, Lallana, Sakho and Origi.

Just after this the team traveled to Australia for two games, the first of which being against Brisbane Roar. The Red's took the win in this match but not without struggle going behind 1-0 after 17 minutes, but luckily we managed to go on and win the game thanks to a fantastic goal from Adam Lallana soon after and one from Milner in the second half.

Obviously, Liverpool continued their tour with another game in for our Australian fanbase, this time against Adelaide United which we comfortably won 2-0.

However, that wasn't the case for our next game against the Malaysia XI where Liverpool seemed to struggle to get past them and star striker Patrick Ronaldinho but Liverpool did manage to get a draw thanks to a wonderstrike by Jordon Ibe.

Next up was today's game in Finland against HJK Helsinki which LFC managed to win 2-0 after a poor first half performance goals from Origi and Coutinho.

Coming up tomorrow for Liverpool will be another game against Swindon Town, however the majority of the team will be backups, we will most likely see the debuts of Benteke and Firmino.

Especially with Liverpool's first few games (Especially our first seven away fixtures of the season against Stoke, Arsenal, United, Everton, Spurs, Chelsea &amp; City) the start we make to the season could be vital on how we do all year round.

Now I think that's everything you need to know.

I don't like the headline either, it is fear-mongering, but it's also a reference to what Cameron said complete with quotes and context.

Other way around. Newspapers are used as proxies for people's values, and just like the typical ""Daily Mail reader"" has a certain reputation so does the ""Guardian reader"". In particular the stereotype would put them as the most likely to jump upon a verbal injustice, yet there's been no big fuss about ""swarms"" until now despite it popping up regularly in a variety of contexts.

So alright that's not the strongest indicator ever, but when combined with the attempts to draw paper-thin distinctions between fundamentally equivalent statements it becomes clear there's something more at play. Either it's a cheap attempt at arguing we should let those people through (bypassing any discussion as to the consequences of that) or it's just the usual tribal politics made more potent with a claim to absolute moral superiority at stake.

If her tax code was at the worst level possible and she got an hours unpaid breaks a day at £6.50 minimum wage she would only be taking home £37.69 so shes actually above that.
