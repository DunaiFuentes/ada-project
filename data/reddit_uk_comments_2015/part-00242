You may think that race rep 1 piece Dianese suit for £1000 is a good investment and while it will protect you, you might end up getting pissed off having to climb out of it when you need a piss on the side of the road. Helmet, buy new, everything else get second hand, get a set of leathers, a set of textiles and some kevlar jeans and see what you end up wearing most. Then upgrade the ones you use and sell the rest.
Unless of course you're rich then fuck it :)

Same goes for the bike, you say you like the Z1000, and it's a nice bike, but test ride as many bikes as you can before you decide. You may find you don't like the power delivery, or the riding position. When I started riding if someone told me I'd end up on a V-Strom I'd tell them to piss off, I test rode one for a laugh and I just gelled with it. Bikes aren't like cars, they are all so different and the one you like the look of may not be the one you enjoy riding.
Don't bother with the 250, you'll get bored if it really quick, get something like an SV650 or CBF500, they are so powerful you'll scare yourself but they have enough power to be fun. Go by BHP not engine size, an SV650 has 70bhp and feels tame compared to a 110bhp r6 with 46 fewer ccs.

Doesnt matter where you are from or what club you support as long as you cheer on NYCFC. Heck an example was just this recent game in toronto where the third rail saw a group of Man City supporters and even they admitted at first that they were separate. After the half they invited them to their section and all supported and chanted and sang for  the team up in Toronto.
I think slowly everyone is learning to get along. Although their will always be a select group from either side either NYCFC supporter or Man City who think they are better.

You can sign players at **any** time. As soon as the contract is signed they are your player. This can be done at **any** time like I said before, but they cannot play until they are registered to the league. The only times you can register a player to play are during the transfer windows. 

So signing a player in February doesn't happen because they wouldn't be able to play for 6 months(until the new season starts). 

Obviously when the season ends teams will just start making bids as there isn't anymore football to play, meaning they can sign a player in June and won't register them until the window opens in July, but as there is no football in that time, neither the club or the players mind waiting a month.

Understand? 

We also have not signed Clyne yet. We've got past Southampton but he still has to sign a contract. When he does that, he's ours. At this point another team could decide to match the bid and could also enter talks with him.

Milner, Ings, and Bogdan are done as they've signed a contract , but it only comes into effect when their current one ends at the end of this month.

The Union Jack has [Saint Patrick's Saltire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire) on it to represent all the people of Ireland. Do you feel represented by that? 

Sadly the Tricolour(spell it right yank! =P) like the Union Jack does not represent all the people it is intended for, in the manner it was intended for, represent the same thing to the same people and is considered anything but a symbol of peace by a large number of people in this country.

There is no difference between Gerry Kelly's leaflet and Catholic related items on the 11th because at the end of the day both sides deliberately used religious criteria to refer to themuns, even though it's incorrect and the usuns/themuns is a purely political argument and not a religious one. 

Even though it may be true in the majority of cases it's not a definitive fact that all nationalists are Catholic and all unionists are Protestants. Therefore, in my opinion the two should never be used interchangably, but needless to say both sides regularly confuse religion and politics because its a criteria the majority of us/them have in common and more importantly associate with. 

Let me put it this way, do you genuinly believe that, as you stated, burning effigies of the Pope and stolen statues of the Virgin Mary is intended to cause offence against the Catholics in Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, USA and Italy? 

Most unionists don't give a flying toss about Catholics in the rest of the world and Catholicism in general. Its simply used in the exact same way as Gerry Kelly did, to identify a group of people because they tend to identify with this factor. Do you think an atheist nathionalist would be personally offended if it was just an effigy of the pope? I'd imagine so because they know the intent behind the action and the intent is always more important that the literal translation. If your mate calls you a cunt he's (rarely) trying to actually offend you. You know the meaning and intent, so does he, but the actual statement is an insult.

The real problem with this issue is the fact that the terms have been used interchangably so often that when people incorrectly use Catholic/Protestant to mean nationalist/unionist everyone else knows exactly what they really mean and so no one bothers changing it. 

On 11th unionists know fine rightly who the effigy of the Pope and the statue of Mary is meant to represent, and it's not Catholics for the majority of people there.

Maybe a very small minority of highly religious hardline Protestants see it as an attack on Catholicism but the majority do not. If you don't believe me just look at the noticably declining numbers of people attending church coupled with the fact a lot of ""Protestants"" could barely be classified as Christian by any reasonable measure, to see that not a large number of people really care or believe in Protestantism/Catholicism and fewer would be willing to fight for it/defend it/attack another religion over it. 

Hopefully in the future it will decrease as seemingly more people reject religion and it will be harder to identify us/them as Catholic/Protestant but like I said the real problem is that even when you make the mistake everyone knows exactly who you're referring to and so there's little incentive to change. It comes up from time to time on this very subreddit yet hardly anyone brings it up, again, because we all know what they really mean and who they are referring to. 

The only reason the leaflet was controversial was because the politicians are meant to know better.

I'd also like to add that what football team you support should not be used to imply political persuasion either but sadly that one is less likely to die out over time.
=P. Oh and not all unionists are loyalists.

Sorry for the ridiculously long post, symbolism and communication are very nuanced issues. Democratic People's Republic of Korea sums the point up nicely. When you say it everyone knows exactly who you are referring to yet it is not literally representative of the truth behind the statement.

He's not the kind of player we can lead the line with because he won't stretch the back lines like we need. We need this so our midfield has space to play. I don't think we can shell out this much money for a player that'd need Sturridge to perform. He can hold up play, win a duel, and link up well, but if he's alone it'll be at the expense of our midfield and if he's with Sturridge, Studge is good enough on his own. On top of that, he's injury prone, Sturridge and him together would be a nightmare. We'll find ourselves with Origi and Ings leading the line, both players who won't be ready for that role until at least another season of bedding in. I think benteke is a good player, but I want to revive that ""philosophy"" of the 13/14 season that was gone this one. The one everyone likes to make jokes about. High pressure, lightning fast soccer. He is not the right player for that kind of system. People would say he can add another dimension, we have no dimension as it is. What we're best at, we suck at right now. That's why sterling, a 20 year old who can't finish, started for us in our best run of form. He was the only one after Sturridge who could player our go to style of soccer from the ST position. We need to rescue the basics before we go on adding new dimensions to our play. As much as Origi and Ings have potential, I don't trust them to be able to get that job done this season alone. That's why Bacca is a good fit. He can first play the style of soccer we need, and second he's old enough to get out of the way when our younger strikers come good.

I'm concerned about Benteke's fitness as he's struggled with a bunch of injuries over the past couple of seasons. Seems to have recovered and gotten back into 'form' but there's always a chance it may recur. Sturridge looks to be out till october, albeit because of surgery, but there's no telling how fit he'll be in the future.

Doctor who has some kind of relation to transformers. 
This was back when Marvel published comics for both franchises. 

Death's Head was a character created originally for Transformers. He had a run-in with the 7th Doctor after going into a time vortex (caused by the one of the Transformers storylines). Doctor shrunk him to human size, where he went on to be introduced in the marvel universe as a human-sized villain. 

IIRC the point was just to preserve the rights to the Death's head by taking him out of the transformers-only property.

I have noticed I spell it Tricolor and Tricolour, I don't no why. 

&gt; Even though it may be true in the majority of cases it's not a definitive fact that all nationalists are Catholic and all unionists are Protestants. Therefore, in my opinion the two should never be used interchangably, but needless to say both sides regularly confuse religion and politics because its a criteria the majority of us/them have in common and more importantly associate with. 

I agree, but unionists defiantly confuse political and religious differences more often. 

&gt; Let me put it this way, do you genuinly believe that, as you stated, burning effigies of the Pope and stolen statues of the Virgin Mary is intended to cause offence against the Catholics in Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, USA and Italy? 

Yes, speaking as a catholic it is a direct insult to Catholics everywhere.

&gt; the fact a lot of ""Protestants"" could barely be classified as Christian 

That was always the case. (I could not resist. :) )

I think the only thing that's bad is that he's 28, but he fits our team better than Griezmann. 

However, since Griezmann is 23, I feel that under Jose, he'd be able to in time perform any role we ask of him. He's clearly smart enough as he switched from a traditional winger to playing more centrally as a CF for Atletico this season. 

I think Turan would improve our chances at winning silverware immediately, but I think by year 2, once Griezmann would have adapted to the PL, I think Griezmann would be the better option.

At least, it would think under common usage locking someone in a house for 30 years and beating them would classify them being a ""slave"". However, forced labour can be less severe and is generally work carried out under some threat of penalty. This may well be part-time and even paid work.

Second, the price. If we have 25-30m to spend on a striker, I don't see why we should go for Benteke instead of Icardi, Lazacette, Bacca, Aubameyang.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"He's not a fully fledged striker and I was prepared to slate this video until he appeared. 68 goals in 172 games for Kiev, strong and powerful, loves to run at defenders and he's arguably Ukraine's best player. I'd say as a player he's similar to Cavani in that he can play anywhere on the front line (probably more comparable to Gerrard of 2008/2009 with the way he's killing teams in every game - see vs. Everton in the Europa League) and has a perfect combination of pace &amp;amp; power. He doesn't have the same work rate or goal ratio however.

He isn't a striker as the video appears to suggest. He's a winger by trade (edit: 6 foot 2, so he's hardly what you'd call a traditional winger), but at 25 years old he's just about to enter his prime and has all the tools to become a huge success. He wouldn't come cheap however. Kiev don't want to lose their best player and as we saw with Konoplyanka, transfers in Ukraine can be complicated. According to reports Chelsea &amp;amp; Spurs both fancy him and he'd be available for £19million. **edit: his contract expires in 2016, so Dynamo Kiev need to sell him off as he's said he wants to leave**.

I suppose the main question mark would be whether he could settle in quickly and start scoring from the off. Personally I think he'd be an excellent signing, I'd prefer him to any of the strikers we've been linked to in this window, but I just don't see it happening to be totally honest. 

edit: again, I should clarify myself here, as a winger, he's not a byline player. He retrieves the ball from deep and combines with the midfield and likes to pull strings. He's got a hell of a long shot on him too. **19 goals and 21 assists in 43 games this season** is pretty fucking amazing if you ask me.

The other alternative is to ignore the cities completely and head for rural areas and look for field work (picking fruit and vegetables etc).

If I am an entrepreneur looking to set up a business the UK is attractive for a number of reasons which would trump a marginal tax rate of 50p on earnings over £150,000. It's easy to do business here and generally other tax rates are reasonably average, if not low, compared to other developed countries. Secondly I would imagine thinking about how much you will be taxed once you income goes over £150,000 is the last thing on your mind when you are starting a business, it's more important to make it profitable first!

It is an interesting point about skilled workers leaving and is possibly another debate completely. In my opinion though this is less to do with tax rates and more to do with the extortionate cost of housing and poor wages which are paid to skilful people.

So you can sign contracts with how many ever players you want. But you cannot add them to your squad till the transfer window opens meaning the player cannot play for your club till the transfer window opens.

Lets take Milner to Liverpool as an example. He has signed a contract with Liverpool. But he cannot play for Liverpool till the transfer window opens. Another example is we sold Torres to Atletico in December before the winter transfer window opened. But he could play for Atletico only after the transfer window opened.

It's an impossible statistic. It would require causation to be established  for every death in the UK, and cause of death is not a single factor issue. Records to that depth simply aren't made of kept, very few deaths go to inquest.

The best you would get is 'x people died after benefit sanctions were imposed, Y by suicide' with absolutely no information about ACTUAL cause of death. If it was starvation or hypothermia then we may have a serious problem, if it's suicide there could he a link, if it's alcoholism, drug abuse or health problems then who knows?

There is no value to these numbers other than morbid political point scoring. People are seeking to attribute deaths to the welfare state (or lack of it) and it's simply propaganda to put blood on the tories hands.

I work construction. You used to have 30 men digging up a road with picks and shovels now we have 2 or 3 men with digger and breaker. We used to do cable surveys now the work experience lad can sweep a cat scanner. Hod carriers have been replaced with electric hoists. Scafolders have lost work the MEWPs and PASMA towers doesn't mean we don't have Scafolders we just have less.

It usualy goes a bit at a time. The self checkouts used to be 4 to one member of staff. They broke down all the time and were generaly a pain. Now one person can supervise a dozen the machines almost never screw up and once they can validate age it will be even better. Less hours to go around year on year.

Online anything does for work aswell, so do computers. We don't even go to the bank anymore I just fire the lads wages into their banks. All payment and purchasing is done by BACS even 15 years ago we used loads of cheques that people had to process in the bank every week.

Big jumps do happen but are rare. Biggest one in recent times was the shipping container. The docks used to employ thousands of men transferring cargo between ships, lorries, trains and warehouses. Now we just move it all in one go with a crane, put tens of thousands of men out of work in a decade. I'd bet driverless cars will be like this it's already started in mining and port ops with robot trucks.
once they are road legal it will destroy haulage jobs outside of high value and hazmat loads.

As a customer you would have seen:

* Stock started to be stored on the top of shelving making isles feel cluttered and look untidy.
 
* The quality of the finest range dropped 
 
* The number of ""twofer"" offers incresed to the point where you could not buy a single item of nearly anything without having to pay a premium.
 
* Staffing levels dropped, cleaners, checkouts etc.

* Quality of the fruit and veg declined, more and more was being sold in bulk.

None of these would be catastrophic, but with the rise of the discounters it has been a disaster.

Suppleirs had it worse,  the drive to lower the cost of your products was immense.  Tesco had a view that your factory should not be making profits on the lines they sold to Tesco.  The terms they extracted brought the effective price you sold at to contribution business.  Ie it covered raw materials and production costs but not actual profit.

The idea of this is that because of the scale of Tesco a supplier could in turn get better terms of their suppliers and would see efficiency across the business.

Over time suppliers became fed up of this.  If they had a new product it would be offered to competitors first.  Why work on a new range only to make no money off it.

All in all Tesco have only themselves to blame for their position.

null,false,raggedtrousered81,null,null,null," Totally agree, but it looks like we are doing the opposite just to win votes from the pensioners.
Birth rate is depressed because of houses capable of housing and raising a family are too expensive for young couples and are treated as investments by pensioners and the government.
Pensions are triple locked to win votes. They need to be means tested, these as!e pensioners may have generous private pensions, second homes, buy to lets etc. What is the point of giving state pensions, winter fuel payments and buss passes to multi millionaires like Peter string fellow.
Automation is tricky, may hurt the young workers.  Increasing the retirement age is a bad idea. Primarily it does with nothing to address the fact that boomers universal pensions have !made it unaffordable, it just punishes the younger generation and makes them pay *,even more* to the boomers in taxes. It also stops the younger workers from progressing up the ladder or even joining the workforce ( so they can afford to marry, procreate and buy homes) as the boomers cling on past 65 whilst they still claim a state pension and pay no NICs.
Many boomers at my work love this scenario, they have no kids living with them, cheap housing long paid off, private pensions, and now a state pension, keep their jobs and pay 12% less tax on top. How the fuck is that supposed to stop the unnafordability of state pensions for the boomers?

Except you say that with no evidence whatsoever. He doesn't state at any point how exactly the scoring index works and what the weighting is between the two.

You're inventing some reason why the analysis is ""really quite flawed"" that's utter nonsense - it does exactly what you're complaining it doesn't do. 

He does say that performances aren't taken into account, but then that makes sense considering how complex, subjective and difficult that would be to track for all players in all positions.

You can go to your GP and tell him your issues, as I did. I went most recently telling him I was suicidal (turned out to be a side effect of a drug called Sertraline/Lustral, an anti-depressant...!) and he was supportive. They won't automatically section you or anything like that.

Biblical literalism has been discouraged for centuries. In 415AD, St. Augustine of Hippo wrote an essay called *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* where he discouraged Christians from citing scripture on matters of ""the earth, the heavens and the other elements of the world"", stating:

&gt; Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.

It's fucking democracy. The idea that ""reality isn't like that"" is just nonsense: the reality is perfectly viable, given the number of successful countries with population densities a lot lower than us. Whether the reality of the UK is increasing population density or stable population density will entirely be down to the policy choices we make as a nation.

Your link about net contributors is particularly stupid, considering it's a biased news article covering the paper I linked and debunked in the very post you responded to: as I said, the only reason why recent immigrants, as a group, are beneficial to the UK is because they're recent. As they get older they will consume more healthcare and pensions and they will become net drains, as the entire immigration stock is (linked in the paper, Table 6). 

As for transport congestion, it's pretty damn clear that it is due to population increasing faster than the transport stock can keep up. Read any transport strategy for the UK.

I don't know about Pitcairn specifically, but typically these Pacific island communities are serviced by [tramp cargo vessels](http://i.imgur.com/oCr4Z5q.jpg) which call every 3 or 4 months, and they're generally supported by diasporas of family and extended family who've moved to a developed country and send home $100 once a year.

The economy in these places is a subsistence one, because they can't produce anything which can't be produced elsewhere - Pitcairn must've been severely damaged by [philately](http://www.numones.com/countries/pitcairn-island/stamps/) falling from fashion. I think  selling stamps was the island's primary source of income at one time.

Although the latter does admittedly have nice beaches and a somewhat better location, Pitcairn seems quite a contrast with [Palmerston Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_Island). Palmerston is welcoming to cruising sailors and charge a small mooring fee (I guess about $10 a night), offer laundry services and have this convivial singing-guitar-around-the-barbeque atmosphere with which they welcome visitors.

It may well be for historical and cultural reasons - that the settlers feared the consequences of their mutiny and instilled in their children a sense of mistrust, and then there's the whole sex trial thing - but I just don't find stories like that about Pitcairn. Pitcairn does get occasional visitors, but they don't seem as many and they don't seem to stay as long or write about their visits in the same way.

From the point of view of tourism, Tahiti and numerous other places are far more accessible. You can fly in, maybe take a boat an hour or two to the next island, and stay in the kind of resort which is [inauthentic,](http://i.imgur.com/aTpuBVb.jpg) marketed well and offering margaritas on tap. 
 
If you want to get married abroad, then a city break to London or a Canadian city would be far more compelling. You don't waste weeks getting there and back, there are facilities and entertainments, and your family can make a holiday of your nuptials.

I wouldn't mind seeing how he copes in a more CF role y'know. If ever Poch decides to go two up top (which sometimes he does when it's all going wrong) I'd be interested to see how he'd do with Kane as a partnership. Think he played CF at Roma a few times. He can play pretty much anywhere across a frontline and his finishing and reliability can't be any worse than Soldado or Ade.

However, if he has a similar season stats-wise it could well be his last one at the club. If he ups the goals and maintains/improves those assists, it'll be great. Last year was a really solid improvement in the end, but there's obviously and clearly room for a lot more.",null,0,null,1435312218,null,0,false,0,csj8xei,null,t3_3b6alg,null,t1_csj8xei,null,t3_3b6alg,null,null,null,1437362206,null,23,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,23,null

&gt; no machine can match our creativity

[They can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Howell), and you clearly haven't done any research in this area if you actually believe this.

[Computational Creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity) is a massive field and has been researched for the last 40 years or so. Most of the latest Creative Computer's being developed by University's are indistinguishable from their human counter parts.

Secondly, there is no such thing as a poem and painting based economy; so even if you were right (which you aren't) humans could not sustain themselves by simply being creative and selling their art.

&gt; problem solving

You are partly right in that problem solving is the hardest task for computers, but they can certainly problem solve, and still outmatch us in every metric when it comes to simple problems. This is actually why I chose to be a software developer; because software development (problem solving with logic) will be the last job to be automated. As it is much harder for computers to solve open ended problems than it is for them to say, navigate from point A to B without hitting anything. This being said there are computers that exist right now that, when given raw materials and the end product; they can calculate how to make that end product. Because there are only a limited number of ways to re-create something when you have the beginning and end steps already worked out.

&gt; empathy

Oh please, humans are nothing more than biological machines. Empathy is just an evolutionary response to working in large social groups, it was required for us to maintain some sort of civil order when out in the bush hunting and gathering. If we chose to we could give machines empathy just as we have evolved empathy. There is nothing special or innate about it, reading emotions and understanding vocal inflections can easily be (and has been) programmed.

&gt; there will certainly be people who suffer hardship unable to adapt but the rest of us will still be somewhat unfortunately be working.

Depends on the time scale, you are silly to assume that humans will always be working; this is (sorry to be frank) bullshit. Computers are already beginning to outmatch us in every metric, give it another 20 or 30 years and no company would ever want to hire a human again. Because machines are simply better in everyway.

Can I ask, what do you do? Because even the most difficult jobs of today (doctor, engineer, physicist) is already beginning to be automated.

There is now a doctor machine that can analyse every molecule in your blood, is connected to a network of other doctor machines so it also has all the information of those machines; and can do cloud computing (using the resources of the entire doctor machine network rather than just itself) in order to create antidotes and complex biomolecular structures to combat newly discovered diseases.

All of this information was in the video, if only you had watched it. :(

Anyway, IMO this is simply not up for debate.

We may not be there yet, and probably won't be for at least 20 years IMO; but the time is coming and we should be ready for a solely automated economy. Because at the end of the day, there will be nothing we can do to match the performance of a machine.",null,0,null,1435313111,null,0,1435313388,0,csj94yd,null,t3_3b1z3i,null,t1_csj94yd,null,t1_csitylu,null,null,null,1437362347,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

He'll do something amazing one game, and then look completely daft for the next three.  He needs to toughen up a bit and make better decisions on the ball, because he has the skills and raw ability to be much more effective.

I'd love for him to take some notice of the way Hazard plays... he has an intensity to his play that almost broadcasts to opponents, ""Once I have the ball, you're not getting it off me"".  I feel like Erik doesn't project the same aura, even if he's not as good.  He looks sometimes a bit overwhelmed with options, and then ends up dribbling into trouble or trying a silly pass when as easy one was a better option.

We desperately need a player with an X factor in the attacking third, because our attacking play is very one-dimensional, slow and predictable.  Having someone who can go on a mazy run or play an unconventional pass is a breath of fresh air for us, but I'm not sure Lamela is exactly up to that level of responsibility yet.  He feels more like a luxury player than a game-deciding one for now unfortunately to me.  He ended the season well and might become more clever on the ball, but let's face it, he's never going to be the player we thought we were buying from Roma.

And again, playing less shouldn't really count in his favor since nothing says he'll play more for us. From here, it looks like we'll get the same actual output in goals+assists from Ings as we would from Benteke. 

""Played in England"" doesn't really make sense either. There doesn't seem to be any statistics showing that Premier League experience makes a forward any better. Especially not if we look at proven goalscorers from other leagues.

I'm with you about the sting for the middle class here - I live in a poor area of London and receive no benefits or tax breaks of any kind on a very average salary, whilst most people nearby are either renting with housing benefit or full council tenants (unemployment here is very high), and the actual owners of the homes are living elsewhere, riding high on exorbitant rents and swelling property prices.

I just think the answer to this isn't cutting benefits or forcing the poor out of London. The answer is that London's high prices aren't just down to 'popularity' - it's the mix of popularity with low housing stock. Solving that will ease pressure on prices for rent and purchase.

 First of all, he might not fit our style. The discussions here look a lot like the discussions when we signed Balotelli. Is he a target player? Is he *just* a target player? I think he's a bit too limited, but then again, I haven't seen too much of him. But I don't think all the people who agree with me are retards, so let's sum it up with saying that there are doubts whether he'll fit our style and make the deep runs that make Sturridge so useful.

Second. He's injured *a lot* and sometimes for long strecthes. For someone who'll primarily be used as a back-up for when Sturridge is injured, he's injured too much for my taste and there's the obvious risk that they'll both be injured at the same time.

Third, he's too expensive. Especially considering his actual output in goals and assist per season. These are obviously crippled by he fact that he's out injured, but we can't just suppose that he won't be injured at our club. We should look at the assists+goals that he actually achieves, and assess if that's what we need. And I don't think so.

I said before in this sub that I don't think England managers have total control of selections and I'm pretty convinced the FA has preferred and disliked clubs. Which is presumably why Saints have spent a lot of time schmoozing them since our promotion to the PL. 

&gt;  I never thought my dislike for Man Utd could be topped but I'm almost feeling neutral to them these days in comparison to Liverpool.

Absolutely. Since MU got more competition and started taking some post-Fergie tonkings they're less smug, which is nice. With Portsmouth being a club I barely think about nowadays Liverpool aren't far off being #1 in *Top Of The Hatred Pops*, as far as I'm concerned. 

Fuck 'em - while Liverpool fans are busy wanking each other off over their history the future belongs to us.

null,false,Lengar,null,null,null,"I'm currently doing research on how sunscreens work from a fundamental chemistry point of view. Also I happen to be incredible pale skinned so burn in under 15 minutes in the sun.

It's not only how well they block UVB and UVA, but depending on the chemical make up of the sunscreen, decides how often you need to reapply the sunscreen.

Some of them only need reapplying every couple hours no matter what you do. While others can need reapplying more regularly if you are sweating a lot or after you have been in water. Specially kids sunscreen as they tend to use less organic chemicals which tend to absorb into the skin and sit around for a while. Instead they tend to use inorganic chemicals, the same stuff that makes paper white, these tend wash off with water or sweat. The reason for not using organic chemicals in kids sunscreens is they can cause skin irritation either by being applied or after been exposed to the sun.

This worry about the labeling on sunscreens UVB and UVA protection is slightly pointless, the EU rules on what chemicals can be called sunscreens have to block both UVB and UVA. Though the labeling system could be a lot better.

While there is a lot of conflicting advice, I would suggest using the highest SPF and star rated sunscreen if you are in the sun for long periods. At the end of the day not dying painfully of cancer is way better than having a golden brown tan. Another point about tanning, its a response to over exposure to UV. So by the time you start tanning you've already caused damage to the skin and potential already kick started the process that leads to skin cancer.

On the other hand if you don't get enough UV exposure you don't produce enough vitamin D, and start to become sad or develop issues with your bones. So you need to find that fine balance of not being in the sun too long, but makes sure you are in it just long enough.",null,0,null,1435315182,null,0,false,0,csj9ngu,null,t3_3b68in,null,t1_csj9ngu,null,t3_3b68in,null,null,null,1437362567,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

null,false,SkrtelSquad,null,null,null,"Academically, go to as much as you can. It's very easy to fall into a pattern of going to bed at 3am every night and waking up at midday, missing half your lectures. Work hard, play hard. The people who are respected the most are those who manage to maintain a good social life and still keep on top of their work. Sure, everyone loves the guy who has a party in halls 3 times a week, but if you are failing half your modules, it's just not worth it.

Even if you are hungover as hell, but can make it out of bed, go to your lectures. You learn a hell of a lot passively - way more than you might think, even if you spend half the lecture holding your eyes open barely able to follow what's going on. I've done far better in modules that I went to lectures for than ones I didn't, and it's no coincidence. In exams just remembering the shape of a graph on a board or something could get you a mark or two. You can make up some lost ground when you start revising, but the people teaching you are experts in your field and you'd do well to get as much from them as you can.

Secondly, make sure you plan your modules out for the year properly. You can research and send some speculative e-mails about things you're not sure about in an hour. This is so, so s, so worth it. Things to consider:

* Do they have a set syllabus which you can easily follow?
* Online lecture notes in case you miss anything?
* How long has the module been going - past papers, previous years example sheets to learn from
* Ask supervisors/tutor about the lecturers. Having a good, enthusiastic lecturer is important, though always bare in mind being interested autonomously in the topic is more important.

Outside of this, make sure you get involved absolutely everything. Long term you'll be looking for a job. Your academics can only get you as far as an interview. Believe me, I've had many interviews coming up to graduation but lost out on a lot of jobs to people who I've considered to be less qualified than me. Get involved in sports, get involved in societies that can give you a helping hand towards finding out which career you actually want to get into. Don't listen to people who tell you that by joining the Actuarial Science society you are being a ""try-hard"", because employers love that shit. 

Remember everyone is in the same boat as you. It can be scary, I know it was for me. I'm really not the most outgoing person, but got by in school being good at sports and making friends there. It's easy to build up a bad reputation as someone who 'bails' on things, someone who doesn't like to go out much, someone who is 'boring'. Don't let it pass you by. I definitely have regrets about how I was when I first went into uni. Make sure that in 3 years if someone asks you what you asked me, you don't have any.

But really do enjoy it. Still feels like I just walked out of A-Level results day. It will fly by. But don't regret anything. Don't miss that 5-a-side football match because you can't be arsed to get the shitty Sunday bus service. Don't miss that support class which will tell you the solution to that assignment question you spent ages trying last week.

If the case is that they have their benefits cut, they will appeal the decision because they have little other option. 

There are many ways to tell. I had an acquaintance who suffers from schizophrenia who receives benefits because his condition means he can't hold down meaningful work. He ended up going to stay abroad with a friend and had his benefit cancelled because they 'noticed' he was withdrawing money abroad. 

If you are receiving money from the DWP for health reasons, physical or mental, you have to be in fairly regular contact with people who assess your case. These people will also have access to your GP, other health records and services. There will be files and files of data on these people. 

It's not as simple as being on or off benefits either. There are many ways for the government to fuck over people in this situation. If they loose their benefits, they can make it so you can just get lost in the system for months on end trying to get it reinstated. In this time people can loose access to vital services, loose their homes etc. Put all that strain on a mentally ill person and what do you expect can happen? But for some reason it's considered acceptable because there's a pretty strong undercurrent of thinking that it's ok to treat people who rely of benefits to live as somehow subhuman.

So what's your major reasoning behind this? Admittedly, I'd prefer to buy Tom Carroll and Loan Adebayor... but still, I think these could be good signings. People who are willing and want to work with Tim can be an asset, and likewise, he knows their best roles and how they play/fit in to the squad. Maybe we should break them all down:
____________________________________
- Adebayor - I don't understand all the hate here... He's not -that- old, he's 31. Depending on his fitness (and he's always been decently pacey), he could do top flight for another 3 years at a club like ours. He's big, he's strong, he's decently fast, and Tim Sherwood knows how to get him scoring. The only thing I'm concerned with is wages, since he's been pampered by some pretty high ones at Arsenal, Monaco, City, and Tottenham (I think he's 100k a week at Tottenham?). He would have to take -at least- a 50% pay cut from his  Tottenham salary... I hope if we sign him, it isn't 75k a week. But as a player, I think I'd still be okay with him here. Not as good as Austin, but better than I think every other striker we have been linked with.

______________________________________________
- Townsend - Pacey winger type.... We have have literally none of these right now. Sinclair usually likes to cut inside and score rather than cross, Grealish is more of a central guy I think, Nzogbia is also more central (but admittedly I don't know wtf N'zogbia is supposed to be doing). We need at least 1 winger who's fast, and knows how to cross, and I think that's Townsend. His wages couldn't be that high, but I am concerned about his transfer fee (rumored at 10million or even 10million+ I think). I hope it isn't that bad... If it was anything &lt;10million I'd be over the moon. 

_____________________________________
- Carroll- I'm sorry to say I know nothing about this guy. I know he made a good number of appearances for a very strong Swansea side, so that gives me some confidence, however I don't even know what type of player he is. Wikipedia claims that he is a creative deep lying playmaker who possesses high pass percentage whilst not sacrificing creativity and forward passing, which is a nice prospect... Sounds like maybe Westwood2.0, but perhaps better. I'd prefer if we were to loan in a player that it be with experience while we buy the young guys, so a loan for Adebayor and a transfer for this kid might perhaps be the best thing... But I trust Tim and the scouting team, and I hope that this guy is worth it.

null,false,hennell,cnty-uk,Bristol,null,"&gt;What I don't think can be justified is taxing people to pay for entertainment like Eastenders and Strictly Come Dancing.

The problem with cutting shows like this is they are the big audience getters. Without some 'mass appeal' tv the BBC would be attacked as 'only for snobs' and questions about why everyone funds it when only X% ever watch it etc. Shows like that effectively subsidise the ratings on more expensive per viewer shows like documentaries etc. They also reach a differnt audience you can then cross-promote other shows too.

Also in the case of Eastenders there are a lot of cultural and social issues covered within the program that may do more than any series of documentaries on the subjects. Mental health problems, drugs, domestic assaults, rape, euthanasia and numerous relationship and multicultural issues have all been shown in various ways and I've seen any number of editorials praising their display of an 'issue' which has reportedly 'raised awareness' of some social ill. Sure the show doesn't appeal to me in the slightest, but it does have more to it than 'just entertainment'.

There is also the argument that BBC shows do well to bring the standard up of other networks. Strictly and other BBC talent shows have a reputation of being nicer (and being less about selling someone Simon Cowell manages) then the ITV equivalents, and the channels commonly compete on drama qualities etc which the BBC tends to set.

Osborne was rescued by the 2013 compensation payments for PPI - it was like a tsunami of money going from banks to consumers, and had the same impact on the economy that giving people one of those periodic tax bonuses the Americans are so fond of (for example when the financial crisis hit, Bush and then Obama actually mailed cheques to people to stimulate the economy - they got criticised because predictably some people went out and spent it on porn and gambling, but the overall effect was a stimulus). Osborne got lucky because the retail banks essentially did that job for him - I think the total amount was about £36 bn, with £14bn being released in 2013 and £22bn in 2014.

Miliband made a mistake, he should have given Yvette the shadow chancellor role, but he didn't because he saw her as a rival and the home secretary job was supposed to be a ""graveyard"". 

Miliband had an unfortunate way of calculating personal gain at the expense of the party. Another example is the way he siphoned off Lab activists to attack Clegg in Sheffield Hallam, leaving Labour MPs in the area like Balls unsupported. That had a double bad effect. Lab MP's lost their seats and because the LibDems diverted money to defend Clegg, it enabled the Conservatives to rout them in the south-west. As you can tell I think Miliband was the worst leader that Lab has had in decades. He even messed up the Scottish ref and had to be bailed out by Gordon Brown.

Anyway, back on topic, the contest is between Yvette and Liz for me. Yvette is the more intelligent candidate, and she has a family so knows what people are going through, plus a record of handling her job without mistakes. 

But Liz has the advantage of being very hard for the Tories to attack. The press have gone all in for her because a) they like her and b) they think it's safe to support her as she won't win (so they have a brief window of saying something they actually believe in before they go back to supporting Cameron).

No player is greater than the interests of the club. The reverse is true as well. No club is more important than the interests of a player. I worded the disrespectful comment badly. What I meant to say is that if Cech moving to a rival club is disrespectful then what the club is doing is also disrespectful. 

&gt; Exactly. Which is why we shouldn't be selling him just because we're sentimental. What's happening here is we're giving him everything he wants, while he's giving us nothing in return. So essentially, he's going through with your statement of ""he owns us nothing.""

The alternative is that he stays for one more year and then leaves on a free. If the club can put its own interests ahead of the player, then so can the player. And it is hypocritical to find fault with the player for that.

&gt; So you're proud that the club put a player above its own best interests?

I'm proud of the way they handled it and I don't believe the club is getting a bad deal out of this. It shows to me that they care about their players and aren't soulless. And Abramovich is definitely not someone who is easily sentimental. More importantly, it shows our current and future players that it is worth your while to join this club. If the club is known to be ruthless, then players will take that into account and make decisions accordingly.

I opted out of paying for the licence a couple of years ago because I don't watch it. If there's a show I want to see, I watch it on iPlayer, but the main things I watch are Netflix or YouTube, on my living room TV, and none of it requires a licence.

Za Za Bazaar is ok, and a pretty lively place to eat so a stag party would probably fit in well there without being too much of a disturbance to other diners. While the food isn't fantastic it will soak up the alcohol nicely.

I put it in inverted commas as it actually involves standing in one room, with a few open kegs, drinking and eating crisps while a guy passionately talks about the beer making process. They discuss every bit of it, let you touch and smell all the ingredients, and they are generally happy to open a few bottles for you depending on what you're after (especially if you drop in to conversation that you may need beer for the wedding, which I ended up buying a couple kegs for when I went).

Moor Beer (near temple meads) would be a good shout. Not only do they do great beer, the brewery is located close to transport links, and there is a great pub nearby called the Barley Mow. Make it a beer fest.

As for anything to avoid - I would say avoid the harbourside at night unless you are in to standard crap clubs. 

Good eats - Zero degrees is a microbrewery and does good pizza and seafood. Chomp does the best burger in Bristol, and is located near phenomenal pubs along King St and Welsh Back. Turtle Bay is a raucous Caribbean restaurant that does great cocktails, epic food, has happy hour, and is right in the centre. 

Pubs - As mentioned, King St is the place for beer. You have beer emporium, small bar, naval volunteer, and a place called kongs that has decent beer and is centred around old arcade games.

&gt;This is one area in which the BBC failed abysmally in the recent violence and has a poor history throughout its reporting of the conflict and indeed its reporting in general. Two glaring examples of pro-Israel bias emerged during the recent violence alone. Pro-Israel commentators have every right to offer their interpretation but when they are presented as neutral experts by the BBC and no alternative perspective is offered, the BBC appears either incompetent or shamefully one-sided. One such case was **Jonathan Sacerdoti of the innocuously named ‘Institute for Middle East Democracy’ who had appeared on the BBC just two years ago as Director of Public Affairs for the Zionist Federation but popped up four times at the start of the recent bombing as if he was an objective expert**. Unsurprisingly, his appearance was praised by those who believe Israel can do no wrong, notably Melanie Phillips, who described his unchallenged platform as one of very few “oases of decency” in the “desert of moral bankruptcy” she calls the BBC.

I ride all year, you may get the odd day of snow where you can't ride, but last year we didn't get that much where I lived. Rain isn't much of an issue just buy some waterproof overalls, or get waterproof textile gear.

The price of gear can vary on what you want, helemets can be as cheap as £50. RST are probably the best for cheap quality gear, I had a £70 jacket that definitely saved me from a broken arm and a trip to the hospital,  the waterproofing does wear off over time though. 

MOT's are pretty straightforward, they last a year so say you buy a bike and it's mot is due in August you go down to an approved mot centre and they will check the bike over and tell you what minor and major faults there are with the bike, if you have major faults you need to get the bike fixed in order to get the mot. Minor faults are advisory so you don't need to deal with them but keep an eye on it. Once you've passed you won't need another mot until next August. You can check when your mot is due online on the government website. It's also worth mentioning that way taxing a bike has changed, when you buy a bike you have to tax it right away, then once you sell the bike you can claim any tax back if you haven't had the bike a full year, I'm sure someone can explain it better. 

GS500'S are pretty cheap here, you could definitely find a good one for around £1000-1500 I think, it might be worth checking riding schools, they sometimes have cheap bikes for sale that are well maintained and a lot cheaper than normal.

It's not supposed to be logical, yes there is evidence of a man (Jesus) 2 thousand years ago during the same time that Jesus was supposedly alive, and he was the Jesus that is referred to in the bible. 

In Christianity, it's not supposed to be solid evidence that God exists, it's literally all faith. You believe that that Jesus came to exist, taught us how to live well, loved everyone, was crucified, and went to heaven.

null,false,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"&gt;  We recently got a letter from a Law Firm on behalf of our landlord, which states we need to pay court fees of around £300 within 14 days and then we will receive a court date. 

Tell them to piss off, that fee is the landlords problem. Do not pay a single thing other than the rent. As strolls said, until they get a warrant of execution and the bailiffs turn up to remove you you can continue to stay there even though it has gone to court and the eviction being granted. It is quite possible to prolong the eviction. A Section 21 notice needs to be served and it needs to be done in a specific manner. If it isn't done in that manner it will get thrown out in court and the landlord would have to start again from scratch. The important part is that you are given two full months notice from the start of a new rental period. So if you pay your rent on the first of every month, if the landlord was to give you a Section 21 notice now it cannot be for a leaving date before the 31st of August. If it was then its not valid. 

So lets say they serve you and its valid. You continue to live there after the notice expires. They then have to go to court to apply for possession. That'll take a few weeks or months depending on how busy the court is. Say they win. You still don't have to leave. The date the court ordered you to leave comes and goes. The landlord has to go back to the court again to apply for a warrant of execution. That again takes time. This time you have to leave on the date it gives because that is the notice that allows bailiffs to come and remove you. As you can see, this can drag on for some time. Don't panic, you're not going to be homeless tomorrow and the fact the landlords solicitors have sent you this demand shows you're the ones in the strong position.

Yours, a landlord.

&gt;  I am aware that we will be allocated housing but how does this work? Will we be homeless? 

It'll be emergency housing aka B&amp;B or temporary as in a council flat short term for up to 2 years depending on what the availability of property is in your local authority. The fact both your mother and partner are disabled will work in your favour.

null,false,pbhj,uk,.,null,"**See corrected figures in edit.**

If every household got a £10k pay rise then the median household income would be £10k higher. For simplicity lets say the median moves from £25k to £35k.

~~At £25k 40% of that is £10k.~~
~~At £35k 40% of that is £14k.~~

Now households on £10k before are now on £20k and so are above the 40%-of-median threshold. Indeed you'd have to be on less than 10% of the median (less than £5k) in order for your £10k bonus to put you below the new poverty line. 

Less children will be in poverty according to the metric not more.

**Edit:** as /u/LazyGit points out my figures here are wrong, the threshold is 60% of median but the result is qualitatively the same, less children will be ""in poverty"".

So that should be:

At £25k 60% of that is £15k.

At £35k 60% of that is £21k.

Now households on £15k before are now on £25k and so are above the 60%-of-median threshold. Indeed you'd have to be on less than 45% of the median (less than £11k) in order for your £10k bonus to put you below the new poverty line. 

Less children will be in poverty according to the metric not more. Everyone in the range £11k - £15k has with the additional £10k now moved above the ""poverty line"" of £21k.

The good news is a lot of these issues are fixing themselves over time. Solar power is getting cheaper and better with every year that passes, as is wind. Battery powered cars are already a reality, and in 10-20 years will be the norm.

I chose this example because all you need is a jet washer, drain rods and a van and you can get jobs cleaning sewers. That means that those on a low income can start such a business easily. However it's actually got more skill to it and you need to know really about how sewers work to avoid very messy accidents and breaking ceramic pipes and such. That means it's actually easy to get a bad reputation or get sued and go out of business. Low-cost of entry means there can be lots of competition so if you're not good at marketing then you may get very few jobs; I reckon you'd need about 20+ jobs a month to be on equivalent to minimum wage.

Personally I wouldn't class simply owning the means to enable your own work output as being bourgeois. A gardener isn't bourgeois because he has a lawnmower unless it's one of the few lawnmowers around and other gardeners have to rent it to enable them to be gardeners. A mine owner would be a bourgeoisie (unless he part-owned it as part of a cooperative of workers or some similar scheme) because not all miners can own mines, they can all own mandrels though so merely being a mandrel owner doesn't lift you out of the working class (proletariat). Now, not all people can own sewers but you don't need to own sewers to be a drain cleaner because all householders own a part of the sewerage system.

If he can have the same improvement by the 3rd season, he'll be almost as important to our attacking 4 as Chadli had most of this season. That depends on if he can A) stay fit throughout the season and B) retain the confidence Poch put in him the entirety of this season.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I think the concept of pensions and retirement are just changing. The process of retiring is likely to become a more gradual/natural wind down over several years (maybe even a decade) that starts with dropping your hours to part time, and going down in hours. Then the idea that your state pension starts the day you retire may not be the case. If you've saved up and can afford it there's no reason why you couldn't still retire at 60... You just have to plan for it and that's the big difference. All the conservatives changes to liberalise the pension market seem in part motivated by an ideological shift away from expecting the state to do everything.

Gone are the days of waking up at 60/65 and expecting the state to sort the rest out. Nowadays and increasingly the onus will be on the individual to **plan** for their retirement. Will it catch some people out? Absolutely. Will some people so really well from it? I expect so. Is it fair? On the whole I actually think so... It gives pensioners the ability to pick the way they want to retire, but it also acknowledges there is a cost associated with an ageing population.

My parents are a case study I this; I love them dearly but both have just steam-rolled into older age with no real plan. This year they turned 60, and both have 6 more years to work. My mother has a civil service job which was privatised about 5 years ago so has a pretty healthy civil service pension, my father though has what basically amounts to an empty pension pot. Really it's a good example of why the state shouldn't be expected to step in and fill the gap just because they didn't have to foresight to see that one day they'd get old.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"Where in the BBC article does it state that fracking poses a significant risk to human health? Closest I can find is:

'Why is it controversial?
The extensive use of fracking in the US, where it has revolutionised the energy industry, has prompted environmental concerns.
The first is that fracking uses huge amounts of water that must be transported to the fracking site, at significant environmental cost. The second is the worry that potentially carcinogenic chemicals used may escape and contaminate groundwater around the fracking site. The industry suggests pollution incidents are the results of bad practice, rather than an inherently risky technique.
There are also worries that the fracking process can cause small earth tremors. Two small earthquakes of 1.5 and 2.2 magnitude hit the Blackpool area in 2011 following fracking.
""It's always recognised as a potential hazard of the technique"", says Professor Ernie Rutter from the University of Manchester, ""But they're unlikely to be felt by many people and very unlikely to cause any damage.""'

1) There's scant evidence even in the US that fracking itself has caused any groundwater contamination. What *has* happened however is that the fracking fluid hasn't been properly disposed of afterwards leading to it running into lakes/rivers etc where it has polluted the environment. We don't use any carcinogenic compounds when fracking in the UK, each chemical used has to be individually vetted by the govt and nothing toxic (in the concentrations used) has been allowed so far at all. You could literally drink the fluid they frack using in the UK (before it goes down the well of course!) without any ill effects.

2) As Professor Ernie Rutter from the University of Manchester states, the potential ""earthquakes"" are a total non-issue.

&gt;Or if you want to see a source which is not impartial (i.e. actually against fracking), see http://www.dangersoffracking.com/ for why your opinion is just wrong.

You cannot be serious. Holy fucking shit you cannot be that fucking stupid surely? Basically what you've just admitted is that you can't find any reputable source that finds fracking to be dangerous, so rather than conclude that fracking is in fact not dangerous (as any reasonable person would do), you've instead decided to conclude that all reputable sources are somehow biased and lurched to any shite you can find that backs up your pre-determined view.

You have been thoroughly screwed by the system here - few GPs relish working with mental illness and the threshold to disbarring was probably quite low. Of course, we here on Reddit do not know the other side of the story, but ultimately I would advise that you seek out a more sympathetic practice when you are able to.

Regarding the Zero Tolerance Scheme - I have never heard of this. It might be worth calling the [Care Quality Commission] (http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/report-concern-if-you-are-member-public) and report that you are receiving sub-standard care. I assume at this point you have attempted to find out more about your barring from the practice manager at your former practice?

**How many months a year do you get to ride?**
- Anything between 9-12, depending on how cold/icy/snowy it's got in winter.  Wet, meh - no problem, but riding in ice and snow, no thanks. Not for me.

**Or should I say how many months do you guys get without rain?**
- None. Seriously, I don't think we've EVER had a month without rain. Get used to that.

**How much would it be to insure something like a GS500 or something similar?**
- It'll vary hugely on location - central London/other city with high crime rates = much more than a rural, quiet location.  Suggest picking a few places/addresses that are of interest and pumping your details into [http://www.confused.com](http://www.confused.com) (insurance comparison site).

**For a 19 year old foreign student**
- As above, get a few dummy quotes online - this will give you a far more accurate gauge than any of us on here could guess.

**How much do you spend on gear?** 
- Again, this will vary hugely depending on what you buy. i.e. New or something used from eBay? Basic textiles (£100ish a jacket/trousers?) or GoreTex (£300-1000 depending on brands).

Helmets - As above, you can pick up a super cheapo Nitro/Takechi type thing for £50, and spend up to £400-700 for a custom painted Arai.

Check out somewhere like [SportsBikeShop](http://www.sportsbikeshop.co.uk/#/550,0,0) for ideas and examples.

**Gas?**
- Petrol (or 'Gas' as Americans call it) is roughly £1.20 a litre.  One US Gallon is around 3.75 litres if this helps for comparisons.

**MOT**
- Pretty simply, it's a yearly test that (in theory) ensures your vehicle is roadworthy.  Most towns will have at least one MOT testing station - they're done by most motorcycle garages/dealerships.

Yes, they work wonderfully when under heavy demand (is it still the case that you can't get a call or SMS out for roughly the hour around midnight on New Years Eve/day?)

Also, if there's some large blackout, mobile phones aren't guaranteed to work - not all cell sites will have decent backup power supplies. A landline probably will as BT has to give a shit about reliability

&gt; and they have a connection to this thing called the internet.

Ditto. How will your router work without power? (yes, UPSes, but most people don't have one)

&gt; Also this thing called TV aerials.

Except that TV reception is extremely complex, and again, in a blackout, most people don't have battery powered televisions, whereas they probably do have a radio (even if it's in the car)

Could not agree more. The choices you have made included signing up to a treaty and a governance system that implies that people are free to move. If you don't like it, elect a government that will withdraw from the treaty - something that you have consistently failed to do in the last 30 years (no, Cameron isn't it) - but until you complete the withdrawal process, you are bound by the terms of the treaty and that is that. 

&gt; Your link about net contributors is particularly stupid

Because...you say so. Right.

&gt; considering it's a biased news article 

Laughable. It's the BBC. 

&gt; and debunked 

No. You didn't. You made half a dozen of vague assertions that mostly amount to no real fact-based argument at all.

&gt; As they get older they will consume more healthcare and pensions

Case in point: how do you know that they will still be here when they get older. It is exceedingly common for people to retire back in their home countries, how do you know that won't happen? Your own special crystal ball, perhaps?

&gt;As for transport congestion, it's pretty damn clear that it is due to population increasing faster than the transport stock can keep up. 

Because...you say so. Right.

&gt; Read any transport strategy for the UK. Immigration is responsible, directly and indirectly, for about three quarters of population growth, and even more so in London.

10. Liverpool to Up Bid for Villa's Benteke
Aston Villa v West Ham United - Premier League
It seems that ​Liverpool are remaining in the hunt for further striking options despite the £29m capture of Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, with the ​Mirror reporting that the Reds are set to up their bid for Aston Villa's Christian Benteke to £25m, after their initial approach was rejected. 

The bid may still not be enough to prise the Belgian away from Villa Park though, with the Midlands club insisting that the 24-year-old will not leave for a penny less than his £32.5m release clause. 

They could yet see themselves forced to accept a slightly lower bid though, with Benteke reportedly ready to ask to leave the club when he returns from his summer holiday next week. ""

null,false,hebsevenfour,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.

Let's start with this. I'm not the kind of person to care much about spelling, my own SPAG is shit, but it's difficult to let this mangled turd float past without comment. 

The word is ""methinks"". Not ""me thinks"" which sounds like a caveman musing on Descartes. And the quote is ""the lady doth protest too much, methinks"". I've no objections to Shakespeare quotes, but when you crowbar one in in an attempt to sound clever and fuck it up, you end up looking like an idiot. If you want to paraphrase fine, but then just put it in language you actually know and are able to use. 

&gt;Though why someone in genuine hardship who has had their benefits stopped wouldn't be signing up for hardship I don't know.

Nor does the DWP. That's the point. You cannot extrapolate from people who drop out of the benefits system to people who have died after being sanctioned. I'm pretty critical of the changes, but one of the big reasons is that the system has become so stressful that many people have simply stopped claiming (relying on family, friends, carers and odd jobs). This ""voluntary"" withdrawal from the benefits system was actually anticipated, but again makes it impossible to distinguish those who are withdrawing because they have died, and those who frankly are downtrodden, browbeaten or otherwise find the whole process too stressful to continue on with. 

&gt;No-one is saying if they don't turn up they must be dead. But again, that's fairly easy to figure out considering we keep death records and we keep DWP records. 

Right. Yeah, simple. How exactly do you propose it's done? Do you imagine we have some giant UK state database capable of cross referencing stuff? The DWP are in the unusual position of actually having a national database, but births, marriages and deaths are recorded by individual registry offices at county council level. I assume at some point these are reconciled with the General Registry Office, but whether this is done instantly, monthly, yearly or five yearly I have no idea. 

Once you've got the death records for the whole of the UK, how exactly do you propose we reconcile that with the DWP database of people not continuing to sign after being sanctioned? Are you proposing that we build a new database? At a time of cuts which departments are providing all the man hours to do this? It's going to cost thousands, and I worry it would be a breach of the DPA so you'd need permission to even start. 

&gt;why are you so bothered about proper statistical analysis being done if you're so sure it won't show anything.

Because you're talking about spending significant money (mostly in hours worked) to get overburdened civil servants to produce statistical data from which,
even if it could be done, wouldn't allow us to draw a firm conclusion. Even if you could specifically filter out both those who had died after being sanctioned, and then went through death certificates to record cause of death, how could you then tie that to the sanction? How do you know the sanction caused the death?

It's a stupid ill thought out attack, which makes legitimate criticism of benefit changes harder to make by association. ",null,0,null,1435327937,null,0,false,0,csjeh74,null,t3_3b5ynm,null,t1_csjeh74,null,t1_csjbp0g,null,null,null,1437365772,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; First of all its not theirs to plug as it isn't their network but the british public's which was illegally sold to give an illegal monopoly.

Pretty sure BT legally owns the network, the taxpayer was reimbursed by the initial share sale in the 80s and three decades of post-privatisation tax receipts. Plus all the investment BT has done by itself since then.

&gt; bt has not liberalised all of its exchanges to allow competition (this was supposed to happen in 1996).

Can't even tell what you mean here. In the 90s you could choose a different carrier for the calls you made, even though the line rental went to BT. BT has had third parties on their ADSL network since day one.
 
In the 2000s LLU came about, allowing companies to put their own equipment in BT's exchanges and run the entire service themselves, except for the copper line to the home.

&gt; Somehow they were the only receipients of eu cash for broadband upgrades given to britain due to a ""bungled bidding process"".

Do you have a source? The problem is that BT was likely to win anyway simply because of their size and scale. They have the expertise and the manpower to get the job done. They also have the ISPs already signed up and ready to use the networks that would be built.

I don't think EU money was used for broadband upgrades except in Cornwall? (where they've actually done a fairly good job relative to the rest of the country, we have the most fibre to the premises coverage by far)

&gt; They unfairly inflate data charges to their competitors.

What does this mean?

Rain is not that bad. In London it doesn't get *that* cold not to ride. Or... it is manageable or it's just no-ride for a few days/weeks.

Problems you might have in London: parking &amp; insurance cost + your first insurance contract in the country. It can get expensive at first. It will drop, but be prepared to shell out some money. Also, where you keep the bike affects *massively* the insurance premium.

Yes having a pub lunch out somewhere on the bike is amazing.

No, but my former flatmate regularly uses the Sky Go app for news and sport. The original poster argued that a subscription-based BBC would have a worse website. It seems to me that iPlayer would be one of their most valuable assets and the website would be central to their operations. The website was cut back severely in 2010 because of pressure from Murdoch and his Tory chums; a subscription-based BBC would be less likely do that.

&gt; How exactly would one subscribe to a terrestrial TV station? More's to the point, how would you stop people who don't subscribe from receiving in the air TV signals without everyone else having to have some sort of box to unscramble the signal?

Everybody has a box now, either a set-top box or a box inside the TV, because it's all scrambled - that's how Freeview and Freesat work. You might have to enter a code (sent by SMS?) or insert a card where there's no Internet. It would probably be necessary to replace some set top boxes, but remember that the UK broadcasting industry has a good track record at getting consumers to replace or adjust their TV equipment: first for satellite, then VCRs for Channel 5, then for OnDigital, then for nationwide Freeview. 

&gt; In which case the government are going to suggest everyone buys an internet ready set-top box. That's not really fair is it?

I imagine that an upgraded box would come with the subscription, just as it does with Sky. The YouView boxes that are given to TalkTalk customers were partly developed by the BBC, so they've done this before.

In fact, the technology has been around for a long time. *Canal Plus*, which is very roughly the French equivalent of Channel 4, has been subscription-based on terrestrial TV since the 80s, which is one reason why France is the only major EU market where Murdoch is irrelevant.

People keep forgetting that the reason nurses have a poor retention rate is that job satisfaction is pretty fucking low on the ground considering they are overworked and have to clean shit. And it isn't just cleaning shit, it's doing so with a smile on your face. 

If I put in a Ryle's tube (A Naso Gastric Tube), and you throw up on me, I have to smile. At least I can say that ""one day, my procedures will be more impressive and this little vomit is just a step on the way up"". For a nurse that's another day another patient whose been not following the patient orders to not eat before we do this. 

THe problem we have in nursing is that our attrition rate is too high so we rely on foreign nurses who tend to stand the abuses of the system longer. 

Even doctors have it bad. Roughly 8% of our UK trained doctors leave. Australia gets a fair few doctors from the UK. Why? Because we don't pay enough and we often overwork doctors. If it's an 8% attrition for doctors it is way more for nurses. 

Even doctors will be affected by this. Far fewer than 8000 but we will be training around 200 to 500 doctors less a year and guess what? We got shortages in Medicine too as well as nursing.

Do you really think unionists feel represented by a flag made by another sovereign nation to represent them in an attempt to encourage a political and sovereign union. The answer as you pointed out is no and for similar reasons as you reject the Union Flag.

The tricolour was not made by another sovereign nation. The tricolour was adopted by the Irish Republic during the Irish War of Independence from 1919–1921. It was made by and for the people of Ireland, North and South, Catholic and Protestant. Cromwell led a genocidal campaign in  Ireland and Scotland against Catholics.  Cromwell massacred our people and burned down our towns, in the wake of the banning of Catholicism, murdering of priests and  stealing Catholic-owned land to give to protestant Scottish and English settlers. He deported over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants (at that time actually slaves but no one ever talks about how many Irish where made slaves and if you do people scream it is a myth.

The issue then becomes the midfield, as this is quite top/centre heavy. With your 4-4-1-1 you want to use wingers still, don't you think that this would leave us quite empty in the centre defensively? Even if Bentaleb is able to quickly transition to a dedicated DM, you would have lost a great deal of physical presence in midfield,  having less bodies and more offensive minded players.
The 442 diamond gets its width from wingbacks, so if we used it then Chadli would have to transition to play behind the striker to remain relavent (and Townsend would be lost I imagine).

Kinda getting at is that Lennon hasn't gotten better in four seasons and I don't see Yedlin far behind him if at all these days. Probably quicker now too, We've seen Yedlin contribute very well many times on the international stage. I don't feel certain in his defensive abilities to let him get starts at a fullback slot get, but I think he's a fully capable substitute for the right side of the pitch.  

Lennon gets a lot of credit for his tracking back as a right mid/winger, Yedlin is very much the same as he has spent his professional career at fullback. He offers a good option later in games whether we are chasing a goal or trying to hang on to a victory.

It may not sound like much, but Yedlin does pretty well hold on to instruction he's given. I guess the antithesis would be Townsend in his first season. You would see him spoken to at length on the sideline, nodding his head and seemingly understanding. And then as soon as he's on the pitch he goes back to cutting inside and handing row 48 a souvenir. Yedlin is very good at getting an instruction and working his tail off to accomplish it, he's a very dedicated and hard worker on the pitch.

""The stovl version we are buying can be flown from a smaller helicopter carrier."" - It can but the reason for the size of the Queen Elizabeth class is the much increased sortie generation rate that provides as well as also being able to do other things and carry other types of aircraft. According to Admiral Sir Alan West,

""The reason that we have arrived at what we have arrived at is because to do the initial strike package, that deep strike package, we have done really quite detailed calculations and we have come out with the figure of 36 joint strike fighters, and that is what has driven the size of it, and that is to be able to deliver the weight of effort that you need for these operations that we are planning in the future. That is the thing that has made us arrive at that size of deck and that size of ship, to enable that to happen.""

""The whole carrier thing is a fucking fiasco. Shit planes, shit carriers, only enough jets are being bought for one carrier. Why the fuck do we need them anyway?"" - The opinions from colleagues with first hand experience of the aircraft are generally positive and to be frank, I'm not qualified enough to determine the capability of the aircraft. As for there being enough jets for one, that makes the most sense given only one will be at sea at any one time. Two ships are being constructed to ensure one is always at sea while the other is in maintenance or refit.

Yes, I'm asking what a *medical journal* knows about fracking. Is that not a pretty decent question to ask?

As for your third source, it's a good source indeed. The problem is in your usage of it. I'll quote the author's conclusion to the entire document, taken from page 46:

""In conclusion, the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health
from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the
operations are properly run and regulated. In order to ensure this, regulation needs to be
strongly and robustly applied.""

So your **own source** shows you to be wrong in your view that fracking poses ""significant risk to human health"". It literally explicitly states that the opposite is true.

You end up with the tyranny of mob rule and people who need access to those services end up not being able to pay for them at all, because there aren't enough of them to do so.

Because there is a fundamental limit to what can be achieved using renewable energy sources today. Solar power only works when it's sunny. Wind only works when it's windy. What do we do the rest of the time? Tidal shows promise, but nothing more than that right now. Geothermal may be similar. Battery storage of power made during windy/sunny days may help in the future too. But fundamentally, there is no solution to the issue today without either burning fossil fuels or completely changing our established lifestyle and politicians know this.

&gt;And with TTIP - if it is risk free, why do we need to protect certain areas from it? And it's not like big business and trade across America and the EU is a problem. There is no need for TTIP at all, the EU and politicians as a whole could be spending their time on more pressing issues.

I'm not so sure we do need to explicitly rule it out, but politicians will do silly things if it buys the backing of the uneducated masses. Business can be an issue between the US and EU, look at the car market for example - they're separated because of different regulations. Even if the same car is sold worldwide, it will have to be tuned differently for each market and many compromises will need to be made to ensure compatibility with both rule-sets. If this is no longer necessary, the same car will be cheaper to buy for everyone.

null,false,Blubbey,null,null,null,"&gt;How much as he improved upon last season?

He was injured for a lot of 13/14 so there wasn't that much to improve on. He's been better certainly.

&gt;Has he lived up to his widely acclaimed potential and price tag yet?

Not even close.

&gt;What particular area of his game do you think he could improve on?

He's a bit of a lightweight, needs to steadily improve his physique seeing as he likes to try and put it about a bit.. His tackling could use a bit of work too, too often he lunges in. He needs to work on his right foot, that could really improve his game being able to shoot or cross with either foot. - which to be fair he was doing last year, iirc he even had a strike or two with it. Doesn't have to be able to reliably crack one from 35 yards with both feet but being able to get round a player and cross/round the keeper and finish/creating a bit of space and having a go with both feet is a *serious* advantage. Defenders being unable to shepherd you one way to reliably get you on your weaker foot as an inverted winger is massive.

He also needs to go around people more too, that Burnley game he did that and played very well.

&gt;What are your predictions/expectations for Lamela next season?

Just building on this year. If he could do what Chadli did this year (improve massively) and Chadli again improves without having a similar situation like this year I will be grinning from ear to ear.",null,0,null,1435333075,null,0,false,0,csjhobf,null,t3_3b6alg,null,t1_csjhobf,null,t3_3b6alg,null,null,null,1437367984,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt; Glad to see someone talking about the lifestyle/usage aspects of the energy and environmental issues. My main issue with Fracking is it's another short term solution, with risks, to a long term problem. Why not invest in a scheme to insulate houses and increase renewable energy production around the county? Costa Rica has 100% renewable energy, I'm not saying we have to shoot for that but we're a richer country, surely we can shoot for much higher?

Thanks. We do have schemes in the UK to encourage renewable energy, I myself recently took advantage to get solar panels fitted to my roof. However they may or may not go far enough dependant on your viewpoint! Though of course the more we subsidise unprofitable forms of energy generation, the higher our electricity bills will become!

Costa Rica is a similar story to Iceland - they use their local geology to achieve exceptional results not achievable elsewhere. In their case they have tons of rain and natural elevation change, so can use hydroelectric dams easily. This wouldn't scale to a UK-wide solution, plus ironically the green lobby would likely go mental if we ever tried, citing the impact on wildlife of building dams everywhere. Also, Costa Rica does still fall back on fossil fuels when the dams run dry. We are trying to use tidal to generate a chunk of power though, but it's still very much early days and ultimately it's just another intermittent power source when what we really need is consistent power. 

There simply is no technology that would allow the UK to transition to anything like a 100% renewable energy mix today, and this is why we need to frack for gas.

**Price of product:** $15.50 for 30ml

**Where did you purchase:** [Skin Actives](http://www.skinactives.com/)

**Product claims:** *""Refresh your skin with our Vitamin C Serum. Although it might not be suitable for individuals with sensitive skin, the acidity of Ascorbic Acid (L) will exfoliate and promote skin renewal. The vitamin C will help restore elasticity to aging skin, promote collagen synthesis, protect against UV Damage, reduce redness, promote wound healing, suppress melanin synthesis, and more.*

*Vitamin C Serum can be purchased in premixed 15% form, or in a 'mix-your-own' kit that can be used to make a customized vitamin C serum of up to 20%.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.

**Your opinion:** This is a new formulation without the citrus EOs. I mixed about 12% LAA into the serum.

I had terrible experience with LAA in the past, so I was a bit worried, but I really want to incorporate LAA serum into my routine.

The serum is housed in a dark, plastic pump bottle which I keep in the fridge. I use 4 pumps for my face and neck and wait at least 15 minutes before putting on sunscreen.

I've been testing this for a week and so far I really like it. It sinks in quickly, leaving my skin hydrated, but not sticky at all. I experience no tingling or any other bad reaction so far.

This serum gives enough hydration on its own in current weather (it's been quite hot, around 26-28C during the day) and even in my office environment. I don't feel my skin drying up during the waiting time before the next product. Although, it depends also on the sunscreen I wear; with LRP Ultra-Light Fluid I need hydrator around the mouth as it can get dehydrated and flaky over the course of the day (and gets oilier at the same time), but fine alone under my Japanese Nivea sunscreens. But I once skipped ss to work and my skin stayed hydrated at the office. This is actually more hydrating on my skin than the Skin Actives Antioxidant Serum.

I noticed that in short period of time, my skin looks a tad more glowing and more even toned. I don't particularly seek PIH lightening or anything with this product. I just want a good aox and this seems to fit the bill. I will update if adding this to my routine has good effect on my PIH.

It's only been a week, but it looks promising and I'm hoping it will continue to work for me. A definite repurchase.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.

**Your opinion:** I started testing it at the same time I did with the Vitamin C Serum of the same brand. I put this on the left side of my face and the other on the right.

I recently discovered my skin hates aloe vera, but in this, it's quite low on the list, so I want to see if my skin still can handle it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't. The second day into testing this, I started developing some bumpy itchy rash, only on the cheek, under the eyes, of the side I was testing this on. I persisted for a few more days since my skin easily gets hives anyway, so I thought I was having another bout of hives. The itching kept intensifying so I decided to stop using it on the 5th day and use the Vitamin C Serum on that side of the face.

The itching went away immediately and the redness and bumps subsided in 2 days.

I personally think this is a great antioxidant serum packed with science-backed actives, but unfortunately, it's not for me, thanks to my picky skin and aloe vera.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt; Of course but that isn't an unsolvable problem - the fossil fuel industry is heavily subsidised by this government - we should be subsiding the renewable energy industry instead. It's just common sense and it will benefit us all.

You're right that the fossil fuel industry is subsidised, but only in the sense that CO2 emissions aren't taxed as they should be. The problem with this though, is that to apply a unilateral tax on emissions would be economically harmful, so it needs to be done by all countries simultaneously, and this hasn't happened. We do subsidise renewable sources too though, directly. I myself recently put solar panels on my roof for this exact reason.

&gt; Not true about solar - they still work when cloudy or whatever but they just produce less energy. 

Oh I know - I've got an array on my roof! But the amount made even when cloudy is a fraction of that made in direct sunshine. For instance: Today has been a pretty miserable day, overcast until ~3pm and now raining. My panels haven't yet hit 7 Kw/h of generation all day. However on really sunny days I can hit 30 Kw/h.  On a shit day in winter this can get much lower still, to only ~2-3 KW/h generated all day. The point I'm making is that solar power is insanely variable, so it simply cannot be the main source of power to the grid without some sort of capacitor or battery to help balance things out.

&gt;What I'm saying is we could provide what Fracking is producing/trying to produce with renewable, invest more heavily in improving renewable energy and work toward better methods and an increasing usage of renewable energy. Fracking is just procrastination really.

I understand what you're saying, but we really can't. The technology to move to 100% renewable energy literally does not exist. There is no source of renewable energy that can take over from fossil fuels today, regardless of cost. The closest thing is nuclear.

&gt; With TTIP - a lot of trade barriers are there to protect people, many business's don't like these barriers that TTIP is set to remove but many of these barriers are there for our protection. And it contributes to an existing problem of big business having way too much power/influence and this idea that our whole political systems and societies need to be making things as easy for business as possible.

Don't get me wrong - clearly there is a balance to be made here and business cannot be left to run completely uncontrolled. But it's important to note that for all the demonization of capitalism and business, it has driven more people out of poverty that any other method, hands down. The whole point I'm making is that we don't even know what TTIP contains yet, and so there is no logical reason to hate on it yet. Safeguards may end up stronger and not weaker as a result of TTIP.

Of course, corruption is intrinsic to hierarchy and centralised concentrations of power - the flatter and more decentralised we can make society the less opportunity for corruption there is though.

&gt;Some kind of ruling elite has been the end result.

In general terms this is true, where you have a State, a small elite will dominate it and run it in their own interests.  Whether this be slave owners owning slaves, royalty served by lords served by serfs under feudalism, bosses and workers under capitalism - or even, as you imply, ""communist"" party members running the State for themselves and their families and friends under USSR style State capitalism.

&gt;Democracy and capitalism have come closest to getting rid of that but we're now in a bit of a crisis of corporatocracy.

Capitalism was an improvement on feudalism, of that there is no doubt, and contrary to the opinion of some, both the American and French revolutions brought much that was good.  However, I have to challenge you on the common but lazy, if not fraudulent assumption that capitalism and democracy go together.

He missed basically the whole season because of this. He was reinstated to the league in February but it's unclear whether he will play with the vikings or not this season. Despite all this the Vikings finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs. 

I'm sure the Vikings have a good fanbase, but at the moment they aren't exactly leading the league in likeable players.

An NFL team that reminds me of Tottenham is the Philadelphia Eagles. They haven't really won anything since the 1960s, and right now they are known for playing offensive football under head coach Chip Kelly. Also their fans are pretty intimidating and are quick to boo everything they see on the field. And their mascot is also a bird.

For tourism, I'd go to York, (train to Leeds, then change, not a bad journey), it's one of the most historic cities in Britain.

Both York and the Dales are kinda what tourists would go to visit, also maybe Harrogate and Ilkley (also train from Leeds).

In terms of English life, both Wakefield and Leeds are fascinating, but try to get locals to show you around (maybe your friends you are housesitting for can introduce you)- I love West Yorkshire because of the intermingling of human and natural stuff; there's a lot going on in a small area in social, historical and natural terms.

The Aagrah (small chain, but one in Wakefield) is good for curry. However, what I find around the place is the quality of produce is very high, more than there being great restaurants.

Funnily enough, Yorkshire is better at Rugby League than at what you call soccer at the moment. But everyone (well, almost) loves discussing sport of all kinds, so it's a good thing to talk about anyway.

That's just factually incorrect. Capitalism has constantly benefitted from various degrees of corruption. Even today major western corporate interests in Africa and Asia (central, middle, and east) rely heavily on perpetuating corrupt regimes and elements within them to receive generous contracts of various kinds. Many African regimes rely on a corrupt beneficial relationship with international capitalists that ensures the benefits of both at the expense of the people they rule (the recent ruling on the South African mine massacre is just one example insofar as many senior members of the government, including the defence minister and vice president, are on the mine's board). China is the big base of corruption now with hundreds of western and non-western firms implicated or prosecuted in corruption scandals of all kinds. Your comment is just ideological rubbish. Capitalism possess no inherent linear tendency to progressively decrease corruption. Corruption increases and decreases at the rate of which it is necessary for profitable business, after all corruption massively increased with the fall of the Eastern Bloc and the wars in the middle-east all of which have been consistent parts of the logic of capital accumulation.

&gt;but we're now in a bit of a crisis of corporatocracy.

null,false,Tony49UK,null,null,null,"First of all how much experience do you have?  Going on a 2 day course where you learn a bit about the law, an idea of how to run a cellar, how to serve a pint doesn't make you a landlord.  Even if it does mean that you will probably get a licence.

If you buy the business, then it's not a job that you can just quit.  Even it you're just open 11:00- 11:00 you'll have to be about 10:00-00:00, seven days a week.  Or earlier if you have to let the cleaner in , add on deliveries at 06:00 probably twice a week.  Sure you can leave the pub, if you have good staff but staff can be a nightmare, just ask any landlord. And please for the love of god don't hire anybody who's only English is ""me want job"".  Their a pain to work with, cock up all the time and customers hate them, even nice tits can only get them so far.

Pubs have been closing at the rate of about 3-7 a week since about 2000.  A pint in a London pub is about £4 and you can't smoke inside, drink at home and it's about 60-70p a pint and you can smoke, nobody in the way of the football, no queueing at the bar, unlikely to get into a fight, and people spend far more time socialising of Facebook and Twitter and less time in real life then they did 17 years ago (yes we had email and IM back then).  Also don't forget if a fight breaks out what are you going to do? Call the police three times a week and have your licence taken away? Sort it out or lock yourself in the office, whilst the pub gets trashed?

The brewery side of it is the really important bit.  What do you know about it?  Can you do it bearing in mind that microbreweries demand a price premium over normal beer and have less name recognition and almost zero advertising.  So the taste of it and the whole story about using only the finest Kentish Hops, water that's been triple distilled etc. is really important.  No matter how hard you work and how good you are, you will from time to time get bad batches, where the only thing you can really do is pour them down the drain.  You may have some trouble telling the HMCRS that and they may want to tax you on stuff you throw away.  After all you're a lot more likely to fiddle your production figures, then Fullers, Scot Co etc.

If you're still reading this and still want to do it, good luck.

Edit. PS Don't forget that one day the cook, cleaner, bar staff wont turn up and you or your wife will have to know how to do everything.  You can't just close the kitchen one day because the cook was drunk and you fired him.

I watch a good deal of Italian football and several teams have used the tactic very effectively in recent seasons. It should be said though that in order to effectively play the system, you've got to have disciplined wingbacks. I'm not sure Bacuna fits the bill. 

One thing to consider is that there can often be an overload from overlapping opposition fullbacks when our wingbacks are occupied by opposition wingers. In this case, one of the centre midfield players has to have the awareness to drop into the back line and allow either the left sided or right sided central defender to move out to cover the attack. Looking at what we've got in midfield...I'm not sure that player is there. I have no confidence whatsoever in Carlos Sanchez who's game would suggest that he's the natural fit for that role.

Good for you. When I was at school, it was a 5 mile bus trip. I'd rather hear on the local radio station that it is closed, than get ready, go to the bus stop and realise the bus isn't coming.

Yes. Because there aren't any. It's especially unlikely for people on Virgin, where you literally can't change the modem to any other than the exact one Virgin gave to you - not even a different modem of the same model.

Battery powered routers have their place because they can be used to share a 3G or 4G connection from a phone. It is unwise to rely on a mobile network during an emergency though.

Oh, and it's **£40**. I can buy several radios for that. Or one radio and a ton of batteries for it. And I can be sure it'll actually work when I need it to.

&gt; Your questions are silly. I can power anything I want with batteries and generators. Radios are nothing special in that regard.

Best thing about 3 at the back is that it allows you to leave two up, but i just can't really see Tim doing that.



EDIT - Also, absolutely no way on Sinclair as a WB, in the few times he played this season he constantly let him man run past him making zero effort to stop him. I think that was the cause for one of the goals Stoke scored against us

In a world of electronic devices that constantly need charging, how is it ridiculous to have a UPS which can provide emergency power?

&gt;Good for you. When I was at school, it was a 5 mile bus trip. I'd rather hear on the local radio station that it is closed, than get ready, go to the bus stop and realise the bus isn't coming. I could phone the school, but I'm sure they'd rather not have 3 staff members in the admin office answering hundreds of phone calls to say the same thing. And of course, school closures might not be the only information needed

Even if it's only perceived that they're drunk they'll question the licensing arrangements.

&gt;And even if London is under the metaphorical cosh, other cities’ experiences suggest that expanding the number of licensed premises does not entail an explosion of chaos: the night-time economy of Manchester – which campaigners hold up as an example of authorities and businesses working productively together – has grown significantly over several years, but levels of violent crime in the city centre have fallen by 8.2% over the past three years.

That would suggest that holding the industry accountable for individuals behaviour and pushing more restrictions on nightlife - namely restricting the amount of businesses allowed a late licence does nothing to curb crime. So what's the point?

Sure he'll eventually regress, but the move makes Arsenal better for at least the next few seasons, regardless of how it impacts Chelsea. And unless you disagree, none of your other points change that, and therefore fail to get at why other Chelsea fans don't want the transfer.

I don't think Benteke is good enough for us and I don't think he'll be able to play the way we want to play. He's a very big fish in a very small pond, the price tag is outrageous and we've been bitten previously for buying *premier league proven* players. I think he'd be great for Manchester United because of the players they have capable of crossing the ball, our team isn't set up to cross, it's set up to probe and penetrate (thanks Brendan, with your creepy terminology) and Benteke (watch all of his compilations of all his goals, I'm right) isn't a player that can break an offside trap or make the right kind of runs for a playmaker. Fine, you can argue Benteke would go straight into the first team, but I think everyone who is pro-Benteke because he's a beast, need to remember that we said the exact same thing about Andy Carroll, Fernando Morientes &amp; Mario Balotelli and none of them were successful because none of them fit the system we were playing.

Bacca is all of the things Benteke isn't and if Carlos Bacca was 24 I'd say £21million is the deal of the decade. But he's not, he's 28 and as it's been said, Bacca is a short term solution. I think he'd be more of a success than Benteke but what's the point in spending that much on a player who pretty much will get 1 season to hit the ground running and bag us 15-20 goals or he'll be shipped out the next year for being too old? I can't see many long term solutions from Bacca, but he could certainly be an option whilst Origi &amp; Ings mature and improve and Dan Sturridge gets his fitness back.

So, to summarize, neither actually but if you told me that £20million+ would be given straight to the Westboro Baptist Church if we didn't spend it, I'd go with Bacca.",null,0,null,1435344102,null,0,false,0,csjp00p,null,t3_3b7xet,null,t1_csjp00p,null,t3_3b7xet,null,null,null,1437372789,null,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14,null

Balotelli has all the physical and technical tools to be the best player on the field....if he decides that he want's to be.  I don't really understand all the ""problems"" with his attitude.  The players seem to like him and the fans have generally been on his side.  His problem is that he's a little lazy.  He absolutely needs to be paired with another striker, he likes the ball at his feet, good in the air, wicked shot, etc.  Another issue is that opposing players know that they can get under his skin easier than they can get under the skin of other players.  

I'd be personally sad if he left because he's so talented and Rodgers didn't give him a fair shot via playtime.  That being said, with the signings of Firmino, Ings and Origi, the writing's on the wall for him.

One of the things that has concerned me most about the modern Labour Party is the 'intellectual', upper-middle class, Westminster-centric vibes that it gives off.

Many of these people feel excluded from Labour and that was a real weakness of Miliband's leadership (and doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon).

The Party shouldn't bank on Welsh seats as they did with Scotland.
