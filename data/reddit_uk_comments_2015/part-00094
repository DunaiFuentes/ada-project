I'm just saying that we can't just assume we wouldn't make it far anyway had we won this game (which is what OP is saying). We *are* better than what we displayed today, we were far from our best. The tactics and the mentality were in the wrong place. 

The only time we seem to get a sense of urgency is when we're behind and its demonstrated by how many fucking times we take a lead, take the foot off the gas and concede. Just take a look at how we played from between the Luiz goal and Hazards penalty. *Thats* how a team should be playing when we have a man advantage, unfortunately we threw that out the window again when Hazard scored the penalty. 

Also, beating Schalke 5-0 away isn't something to dismiss considering what just happened yesterday, and yes traditionally we look bad against lower opposition like in the premier league last season, but we always step up against the big boys. We haven't lost to Arsenal/Liverpool/United/City in the EPL since the beginning of *last season*. 

You're right about the pattern of jose's tactics, I don't know whether to pin this loss on his tactics (they certainly had something to do with it) or just the performance of the players in general (they lacked determination, often walking, didn't want it as bad as they should've, etc..).

If you are saying that Mourinho would rather pay 10M+ for a 18 year old than play an equally-talented 18 year old academy product, I think you are very wrong. If Ake, Kalas and Christensen were deemed as good as Zouma is right now, we wouldn't have bought Zouma in the first place. I love Loftus-Cheek and Boga's potential, but they haven't shown much consistency at U21-level. Guys like Kalas, Piazon and Baker - who I don't believe are good enough to be Chelsea regulars - are hardly getting much playing time at much weaker clubs, so I can't say I agree with your point if you are implying we should be playing them now. They are certainly no Varane/Zouma. Also, none of the players other than Baker was even remotely close to being the best academy player in England. Solanke's close but he's a 17 year old with zero pro experience. At the moment most academy players are simply good ""prospects"" who can do some very nice things a la McEachran

In short, there's only 1 reason why our youth players aren't playing like Varane did and Zouma is for Mourinho: they are good prospects, but not as good (or ready) as Varane/Zouma.

null,false,spoona5000,null,null,null,"I know after a loss like this this sub plays the blame game, but all throughout this game there was one word I kept hearing from the commentators and that was the word shrewd. 

The difference between Chelsea in the beginning of the season and chelsea now is the first run that we make with Costa or hazard we are not playing the ball, we are not playing in behind the opposition at the half backs. I see Costa on the wing so much when he gets the ball I am starting to think he might be a winger. I am not Jose, none of us are at the professional level but it is not hard to tell we are not playing the way that we should be. Jose is based god but the way he manages our squad sometimes makes me think he is too pragmatic. 

This is the beautiful game, we didn't play beautiful. I think there are fundamental  flaws with the squad selection before the game and after the game starts a la substations. Drogba is a legend, but as many of you have pointed out and it was clear during the game he was a step behind. At this level we should not be relying on the services of a 37 year old no matter what the status of that player is. Remy. Cuad.  Two players that should of came on instead of two of the subs we put in. 

Zouma  was good but not great. Ramires  let people on behind. Costa is our cunt but he could of cost us the game. This is not the chelsea in the beginning on the season. This would of been Shurelles  game but he is off in wolfsburg with another player that should of stayed with chelsea. 


We win the league, we already got one title, next year Jose needs to change the philosophy of games going forward. Honestly we need to play more full tilit. I would rather see my team go for the gold in every outing and lose than watch them win in a shrewd matter. Results matter but the way we play I think matters more.

Like lets be honest, it isn't out the question that Ibe can potentially out shine Sterling next season.  This would cause such an inequality in wages. Which can consequently lead to an overall wage increase throughout the whole team. Here is a unlikely/but still potential scenario, Sterling makes 130k a week.

I understand them blocking sites, but it's not going to stop piracy. 

However, making it inconvenient will lead some people to look for a better alternative. If there's not a better alternative then they will simply find the next website that hadn't been taken down in this never ending game of whackamole. 

Services like Spotify and Netflix do more to solve piracy than the futile endeavour of blocking a small percentage of torrent related sites. 

Of course the inevitable end point of site blocking will be to block sites that tell you where to find proxy sites, or sites that let you know what a proxy is, or websites that advocate for the use of a proxy. You end up having to block news sites or political groups, just to ensure that as few people as possible find torrents and it still won't be enough.

The new pension is a ""Career Average Revalued Earnings"" scheme, which is just a tad less generous than a ""final salary"" scheme, although it is still considered a defined benefit pension, which is far far better for members than just about all private pensions. 

In terms of employer contributions, they are likely to be 15-25% of your salary, depending on a number of factors.

As for additional contributions, it really depends what terms they give you for added years. There seems to be a ""defined contribution AVC"" which is effectively a typical private pension. There are some potential advantages to doing this.

Starting a pension when you're young is generally speaking a good idea.  It's fairly cheap while you're not earning much, and it has the potential to grow to be quite sizeable.

Here are my suggestions for you.

* Read the attached PDF carefully.
* Read the websites that it links to.
* Ask your Union Rep if they can recommend a ""Pensions Champion"". Unions often put people through a scheme which will allow them to give advice on your pension.
* (As an aside - join a union if you're not already a member!)
* If you are *still* confused, find an Independent Financial Adviser (https://www.unbiased.co.uk/) - they can help you figure out what our financial goals are (do you want to buy a house, save for a wedding, retire at 50, etc) and how best to get there.

I am not an expert on alpha - it looks like a good scheme, although a bit complicated!  

**Very** roughly, this is how it should work.

Going by this calculator - http://www.civilservicepensionscheme.org.uk/members/contribution-rates - it will cost you roughly £77 per month (before tax relief).

After a year of paying in, you will have built up a pension worth 2.32% of your salary.  20,000 * 0.0232 = £464.

That is, in retirement, you'll get just under £500 a year.

Let's say that you stayed on 20k, and worked for 10 years.  That would give you a yearly pension of £4,640.

You would hope that your salary will increase over time!

Alpha also lets you pay in more to get added benefits.  Think carefully about whether they are worth it for you.  Chat to HR, your union, or the pension scheme for more professional advice.

I decided against that. For the most part, I thought if I was going to spend almost £100 on tests alone and say I failed each one of them once (perfectly possible - I found out once I had started training for my A2 that I really needed to brush up on quite a few areas) then I would already be paying almost half of what I would be paying for an ""all-in"" A2 license course.

The little bit of carbon that doesn't naturally get released back into the atmosphere again goes on to eventually form the fossil fuels we're burning now, and it's because of photosynthesis removing a whole bunch of excess carbon from the atmosphere before animals even existed that we're even able to live now.

Said nobody that had actually spent some time travelling.  The great thing about Europe is the variance in cultures from place to place.  They should be celebrated not neutered.

In fact it's a little bit insulting to say we have homogenous culture, as if the nuance and different ways of life are just collateral damage.  We're not even culturally homogenous in the UK, with great regional variations. The cultural difference between UK and France alone is like chalk and cheese, and it is a good thing.

&gt;Above all, serious economic power.     

As a share of global GDP the EU is in a massive decline, whereas the US is holding a market share among emerging economies.  You can't just add up GDPs and decide that that makes them an economic power as if you're playing Top Trumps, when what you're actually doing is absorbing ascension states lowering your average purchasing power and inheriting additional costs and instability.

&gt;with countries misbehaving like Russia recently, it would undeniably be a stronger military force if all of Europe was united as one.

It absolutely is deniable.  It's positively calamitous to take two global level militaries able to co-operate with each other through treaty, and to assume that by blending them together as one the sum of their components will be more.

&gt;I'm for anything that brings people together and perhaps stops such things ever happening together.

It's having the opposite effect.  We're now talking more and more about West and East Europe, North and South.  Economically they've become divergent under the single currency and it is fanning resentment.

&gt;A united, single nation could combat global issues like climate change better.

They've fucked that one up as well.  The new santised EU term for it is 'Carbon Leakage'.  For whilst the EU was full of good intention it was slow to react to global politics.  So the US and China at the end of 2014 agreed to cap emissions in 2030, whereas the EU has pledged to keep reducing theirs with 2020 targets - without realising that that means manufacturing jobs between 2020 and 2030 will go from comparably cleaner production in Europe to much more environmentally harmful production in Asia.

People are incredibly quick to criticise and make complaints to the BBC. 

It's very rare to see a positive response to something, in this instance a petition arguing for reinstatement, as opposed to thousands of people complaining about an issue. 

There are always two sides to every issue, and normally the only vocal people are those that have supposedly been 'offended' or find something in bad taste. 

Just look at the Brand/Ross furore a few years back. 

It wasn't until over a week after the radio show was broadcast, when the Daily Mail published a very slanted article, that the tens of thousands of complaints came pouring in from people who hadn't even heard the show, and would not have ever listened to it.

From memory I think she might have had a child support assessment (this is done through a government body, not the court) but it was de minimis or unpaid by him.

The short answer is that she wouldn't bother going to court if there is nothing to get from it. Normally it would be suggested that even a poor divorcing couple get a court order that dismisses all future claims. For whatever reason, neither of these parties did it. Had that been in place then she wouldn't be able to claim anything. Otherwise the default position under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 is that a claim can be brought at any time until before death or remarriage. The delay in bringing the claim and the post-separation accrual point will both factor very heavily in the quantum of her claim. 

The thing to remember with this case is that the question before the SC was really 'How should the court properly deal with claims which might not get off the ground?' not 'How much of his money does this lady deserve'.

Also, in terms of terminology, 'custody' and 'alimony' are not used in England. The latter is maintenance, which can be child or spousal. Custody has not been used since the 1989 Act which made all decisions child-centric - 'residence' is the normal term, though now it technically should be 'the person with whom the child lives'.

It just so happens that Reddit is skewed to younger people, and younger people are more likely to be left wing.

I think partly all the walled gardens of internet content we are being put in, is making us less tolerant of opposing opinions.  Social media has conditioned us into following things we agree with.  It becomes very easy to see that collection of things you chose to follow as the world at large, but it's not.  It's probably not even close.  You would have to actively try to input viewpoints you don't agree with.  

Even Reddit does this, the 'hivemind' mentality people see is just the walled garden of that subreddit.  Occasionally you'll find yourself on the wrong side of it, which is giving you a view over the garden wall.  

People forget Google isn't trying to get you what you want, it's trying to get you to click on something, which is a very different goal.  It tries to predict what you'll want based on what you, and people who looked for the same thing, have looked at before.  If you like conspiracy theories, you're going to get more links to people like Alex Jones in your results.  If you like Formula 1 and google Bahrain , you'll probably get into about the Grand Prix in the top results, while I'll get mostly news and a few travel guides (and this is without being signed into to Google).  

tl;dr. 

We've build online profiles for ourselves by self selecting things, and being put into boxes; which give us echo chambers of people we agree with.

Of course this leads to some pretty daft (and extreme)  examples, such as hiring heavily pregnant women to cover maternity leave, but the law states that if she is the best possible candidate she must be hired.

Therefore employers look for any sort of excuse to hire one eprson over another. I have been turned down because I have been under various circumstances ""not a good team fit"" (damning) and ""not bringing enough to the group"" (vague as hell), despite meeing all criteria in the job description.

So yeah, I agree with you here. But by Farage's proposal, should we remain in the EU then the ECHR would quite rightly step in and say that discriminating in favour of British born people is illegal. Equally, should we leave the EU and Farage's proposal becomes law then you risk tons of below-par candidates being hired instead of the best.

You need only look at what's happened to us and other clubs in _all_ of the knockout competitions in recent years to see what a devastating effect throwing too many eggs into one basket might have on a club.

I regularly had to prevent my manager (british, licensed!) from serving the contents of beer drip trays to customers or covering other shifts because the Brits down to work them would phone in as ill and then a few hours later be revealed to be simply hungover as last night's photos hit Facebook. 

The brit receptionist would spend her day shopping online and complain bitterly about being interrupted by customers checking in to the hotel, the assistant manager was on a mission to accuse every person under the sun from stealing from the till when it was plainly obvious she had lied about her mathematical ability and couldnt accurately count the cash in the safe at the end of the day.

On the other hand, a large bunch of eu and Indian staff would work the dirty, tiring jobs with nary a complaint - changing rooms, kitchen work, portering and food service all with a smile for twelve hour shifts each day every day.

If I got somebody to try out in the bar, without fail, the British people would either whip out their phone at ten seconds after serving a customer, had an incredibly shitty attitude or were barely literate or numerate.

I expect a team that is top of their Domestic league to win against a team of 10. 

PSG is a top 10 team but not a top 5 (my opinion so no need to debate this)

I am not hating on Jose Mourinho, I am simply saying he got his tactics wrong in this match. 

I think you're embarrassing that you think us not losing against City, United and Liverpool makes Mourinho the best manager. We barely scraped a win against Liverpool, drew to City twice and drew to a very average Man Utd. 

Those are the games that we should be coming close but we shouldn't be throwing away points in basic, bread-and-butter games. That is the point of my OP, that where a win wouldn't be something remarkable, we seem to switch off.

It was the toughest match of the season so far. Our players don't need to prove anything in any match.

&gt;It's like he's become obsessive about his playing to progress strategy.

Progress = Trophy. What do you propose a manager should be obsessed about? Economics (Arsene Wenger)? Beauty of play?

&gt;His tactics are great but what he used to apply for the last 10 minutes of a game has slowly crept up to become our full 90 minute strategy. 

What knockout games were you watching last year? Give me examples. Or before in his first stint?

* Tuition fees - They got trebled. Regardless of the arguments for doing this, the jump from £3 to £9 hits students hardest. Banking again irrelevant.
* Stagnant wages - This barely affects retired people as they don't earn wages.

Now add some newer policies for pensioners:

* 'Triple Lock' pension - Increases the pension by inflation, wages, or 2.5%. At worst, pensioners will remain net equal for their earnings. At best, its above inflation increases.
* Pensioner bonds - The rates on these are much better than normal savings rates. Their superiority to other savings possibilities is evidence by their huge subscription rates.

Sadly it replaced an HMV, and according to the manager at the time, it was one of the few stores in the country that was actually making a profit!  I can only imagine that Morrisons made the landlord an offer that they couldn't turn down which forced HMV out.

Restatement of the already known in a way that frames how ridiculous it is (particularly juxtaposition of opposed comparative adjectives) does the same.

The state of /r/soccer is ridiculous at the moment. As a Real Madrid fan I've experienced how annoying the circlejerk is lately. There's no room for actual discussion, it's just about shitting on rival teams, when they're doing bad.

However - the reaction to the Chelsea game is on a whole new level of stupidity. Literally every single thread is just people calling Chelsea/Chelsea player cunts and getting upvoted. Someone makes a thread and asks why there's so much hate for Chelsea, and every single comment is just ""this guy = cunt, this guy = cunt, owner = cunt, manager = cunt"". It is so god damn stupid.

People are even coming to this sub to shit on Chelsea - I know, because I came here by seeing a cross-post to /r/realmadrid..

I don't think it is ever going to change, because as I see it, the problem is that /r/soccer has become too big, and that's why all the ""easy-laugh-shit-content"" is upvoted. I'd like to address this problem on /r/soccer, but if I do, I suspect I'd have to wait for Real Madrid to be out of the spotlight first, cause as it is now the only response would be ""look, a Real Madrid fan crying/being salty"" and some hilarious jokes about Ronaldo diving..

I don't like Chelsea - not at all. But I just want a community where people actually discuss football instead of this shit.

The most natural response for you guys right now would be to just stay away from /r/soccer. The sub is developing into a place you only visit, when you've won a game, so you can post your 'hilarious banter' and shit on the teams that have lost.

I bought this because I wanted to try using salicylic acid for my SD.

**Your opinion:** This moisturizer is light and sinks in quickly, it feels like nothing on skin. Skin looks normal, does not look hydrated or moisturized, but helped preventing it from looking dry. I take it as a good sign, since it doesn't clog me or aggravate my SD. I wouldn't really call it mattifying as my skin behaves the same naked, just preventing it from feeling tight in the cold wind.
I don't have acneic skin, so I wouldn't know how this would fare for acnes and clogs. I do know that this doesn't contribute to my SF filling up.
I don't like the EOs in this, but they don't bother me and I can't even smell them.

As a simple moisturizer, this does the job alright and I'm pretty content. I will use my tube up and may repurchase if I don't find anything better.

So, you recommend I read a book that basically states that a lot of journalism is ""churnalism"" and a high percentage of stories are based on press releases instead of original copy.

So, I was sent some churnalism by SF on that day, I decided to delve into it and ask them questions - which the press officer wouldn't answer. I could have just put the thing on the page and added the quote ""When asked SF would not reveal just how many protestants worked for their party... .A SF spokesman said...."" 

But instead I took a different tack and binned the fucking thing and got on with the original copy I usually write because the SF thing wasn't very interesting, it wasn't anything anyone didn't already know, and there was nothing incongruous about it. 

Now, if I get sent a press release that's actually in the valid public interest and weird and wonderful and interesting, I will still contact the people who sent it to get more information and pictures, and comment from anyone involved in that realm.

Just wanting to ban everything is the road to prohibition which we know does not work. It also reeks of bullying. Now that smokers are a minority they are being made outcasts. Smokers are net contributors to the NHS, if they want to slowly kill themselves doing something they enjoy and don't want to be really old one day then why not let them?

I think they are a great team. But they were down to 10 men and we were in the driving seat. So yes that should have been a straight forward win

&gt; It was the toughest match of the season so far. Our players don't need to prove anything in any match.

Our players absolutely do need to prove something. You can't just say you want to be the best team in the world, you have to prove it. Usain Bolt isn't the best sprinter in the world because he broke the world record once. He does it time after time. 

&gt; So you are cool with the plan if it works, but its an emabarrassment if it doesn't

I didn't communicate my point very well in my original post. I meant that to the team it was acceptable in terms of progressing. We seem to be content with doing what is required to progress yet treading very close the line. 

&gt; Progress = Trophy. What do you propose a manager should be obsessed about? Economics (Arsene Wenger)? Beauty of play?

See point above. We are treading too close to the line with this strategy and last night it backfired. Our tactics last night seemed to be to hold on for progression for 90 minutes. There was no sense of wanting to create some sort of safety net in case PSG somehow scored. 

&gt; What knockout games were you watching last year? Give me examples. Or before in his first stint?

I was referring to his first stint. And the ""Give me examples"" is quite illustrative of your entire comment. Just tell me what you think or provide examples to illustrate what you believe and then I'm pretty likely to be open to criticism of what I've said. I'm sure we can find mutual ground on some points and agree to disagree on others. 

&gt; All players are behind Jose and I have never heard a single player criticizing Jose.

No and nor should a player publicly criticise the manager. Schurrle and Salah never criticised Mourinho, nor did Mata but are you seriously telling me that when they were at Chelsea their morale didn't dip because of Mourinho's decisions. 

&gt; Now I give up. Literally every line you have written is comedy.

Literally every line you have written is an attack on my post. You could have opened up a discussion on any of my points but instead decided your view was against it. The fact is our performance last night was shit otherwise we would have progressed.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.
I bought this because I wanted to try using salicylic acid for my SD.

**Your opinion:** I've been rebuilding my whole skincare routine after a recent bad SD outbreak at the beginning of the year. I want to find a moisturizer that hydrates and moisturizes my skin well when the weather's colder that's light enough, doesn't clog my skin and doesn't aggravate my SD/PD. After much contemplation researching ingredients lists of various products, I chose this for me to try first.

It felt really nice on my skin. It's light and sunk in quickly, yet made my skin feels hydrated and moisturized. It made my skin a bit shiny, but I don't mind about that at all (I like the hydrated/moisturized look).
All went well until a couple days later I started noticing clog bumps on my forehead. I kept going just to see if it's a fluke, but they didn't disappear or diminish and the last touch was a huge cyst on my chin, which I very rarely get. I stopped using it immediately and my skin went back to normal, except for the cyst that I had to tend.

Now, my skin was in a messed up state at that time. I also just got a cyst died down after testing an oil mix I used to use to oil-cleanse for the past few months without problem.
I don't see any ingredient that may be the problem for me.
Given all that, I may give this another try later on after I get over my scare of getting another cyst.

Packaging is nothing special as it's utilitarian. It's a white curvy flat bottle with a flip top and I have no problem dispensing the product. I don't really care for fancy packaging anyway.

Equally it seems insane to suggest that we should hire people based on where they were born - I mean I'd hate that if I was born in one of those countries and worked hard yet couldn't get ahead simply because I crawled out of the wrong birth canal.

But equally the freedom of movement of labour will act to bring down wages for the UK worker (where jobs generally pay better) while being a massive benefit to employers who can reduce costs.

We cannot allow it to become a country with a sharp divide between those who own capital and businesses and those who work with no real way to cross the gap.

It is terribly classist to act as though all British workers are lazy or racist - the downward wage pressure will affect all workers, lazy or not, and people just want to ensure they get a fair share of the fruits of their labour.

My comment was based on an assumption that the company may be a multi national company, operating from more than one country - it's not impossible that the company he works for organically grew as a multi national company. If this is the case and the company wants to employ Nigerians in Nigeria, that's fine. 

I do, however, think it's unfair on British workers when profitable British companies move their workforce abroad to cut costs. Perhaps this is what happened with the company fixit_mick works for. If so, then I agree, that's pretty shitty.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"Well to be honest, I'm not completely sold on the idea - I just want to make sure people are attacking it for the right reasons and not the wrong ones. I imagine the objections you raise could be met if the polity were sufficiently motivated however. 

I count about 100 Parliamentary Committees currently ongoing, and you probably need at least two specialist MPs on each committee (one specialist to answer technical questions, one 'lesser' specialist who doesn't need to know the answer to all the technical questions but needs to know enough to call out the expert if they are obviously giving misleading answers for political reasons). The key point would be that at least one person on the committee would need to know when they were out of their depth and so need to call on a *real* expert - like an academic or other specialist. Some committees can have specialists pulling double-shifts (so for example the same economics experts could sit on the 'Treasury Committee' and the 'Treasury Sub Committee'), but some committees would need more than one kind of specialist (e.g. the 'Northern Ireland Affairs Committee' would need at least a constitutional specialist, an economist, someone who knows about policing / counter-terrorism and a local expert). Let's say at a ballpark that we would need no more than 600 specialists - allowing us around six unique experts on each committee.

It seems to me that that is a lot of bodies to work with. At an initial run, you could use some pretty simple algorithms to ensure that committees were biased towards accepting members with some qualification or experience in that field. Perhaps committees could make your invitation to them dependant on your acquiring or possessing some kind of qualification in the field. If you don't want to get that qualification, you'd still be able to represent your constituents, but you wouldn't be able to represent the whole country on a committee.

The cost of all this training is a non-issue. If a £10,000 training course makes 1/10 of a committee 1% more accurate in the allocation of a £10m budget then the training has paid for itself. The cost of parliamentary time is more substantial - because any time spent training is time spent not representing consitutents - although I would hope we're mostly electing intelligent people who can get to grips with a subject faster than average.

Overall though I think it would be pointless - MPs aren't stupid and I suspect they know exactly when they're in over their heads, but they have very strong political incentives to ignore that in favour of grandstanding and coming to a conclusion which is politically paletable.",null,0,null,1426160195,null,0,false,0,cpcfsfe,null,t3_2yrscf,null,t1_cpcfsfe,null,t1_cpcf7xp,null,null,null,1427717564,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;Rose isn’t getting caught constantly out of position as we have seen from him in the past.

&gt;His positioning and decision making aren’t quite where they need to be just yet.

I think the biggest problem with the article is that it comes across as an opinion piece without anything to back it up (especially with language along the lines of seems, appears etc.). You have two stats in total:

&gt;Rose had won 37 of the 42 tackles he had attempted, which is the best rate of any Premier League player to go into over 40 challenges.

&gt;His 78% pass completion rate

and you don't really go into more detail on anything that you say in the article, if you're going to do a piece on a player (or a position) I think you need to bring up a series of moments that show they have consistently improved in an aspect of their game.

Your headline also makes it seem like you are going to be discussing something other than our current starting LB and back up. You're also implying only LB has been a significant problem when our defensive issues have been a little bit more than one position for the past while.

I've read a lot of stuff from Arsenal fans, especially Sulphur32 and Alex1609, about how we're ""well known for racism"" whilst opining about how open and inclusive Arsenal fans are. Sure, their firm stood fast against the National Front wankers unlike ours, but most definitely not against anti-Semitism. I read a post on /r/Gunners the other day about how Arsenal's firm was inclusive to all comers, pioneers of LGBT inclusivity. 

Do me a fucking favour. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK4sZJJomAY) a video in which a portion of fans sing along to a song calling Ashley Cole a ""fag"" and a ""batty boy"". But it didn't take place in the stadium so it doesn't count. Well [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w01LGeAsWhM) another one at Old Trafford. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhTDSSiMio0) a video of Arsenal fans singing an anti-Semitic song at a Spurs fan. It's at 40 seconds for those wondering.

The point is not that Arsenal are worse than us. Definitely not. I've heard similar thing at Chelsea. But the way in which we're presented as *the* problem. As *the* boogeyman. It's Chelsea's fault. Not football. Chelsea.

It's divisive and brings the debate down so that it gets split along the tribal lines so loved by football fans.

If you explain this to people on /r/soccer then they usually just ignore you.

If you are sat at the end of the power band of the engine, I wouldn't worry too much as it will be restricted to handle the load of what is being demanded (unless it is a cheap Chinese bike). If you think of the red line theory. The red line is where the engine is happy to sit at. It may not sound great, but it is engineered to be run at that point. The start of the red line is there to tell you to modify the power by either changing gear or giving it less throttle.

In any case, if you decide that sitting at full pelt isn't good for your bike, there is no reason you can't keep up with bigger vehicles driving at a limit of 56mph as long as you're kept visible.

My mother's skin absolutely loves the stuff and it glows! Strange. 

I can point you to our fledgling [Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/beginners). It has a lot of information, but it's worth taking it slow and reading through everything. We're here to answer any more specific questions you have. **I'd start with just reading the section about cleansers first**  as that's usually the area people tend to make the most mistakes in. Start there and once you're happy with your cleanser move on to other things. You should be looking for products that make small incremental changes, don't be discouraged if you don't wake up overnight with perfect skin.

Some questions to think about now: 

* What is your current routine? (ie. What are you using and what have you tried?)

* Are you allergic to or sensitive to any ingredients or product formulations?

* What are your skin concerns? (besides acne is there anything else bothering you?)

These questions will help you start thinking about how to go about things and also give us information on how to advise you better. No-one can offer medical advice, just point you in the direction of possible helpful products. 

We have a Troubleshooting Tuesday topic where you can post more questions if you're feeling more overwhelmed. Hopefully people come here and answer any more questions you may have!

Demonstration of stopping distance etc.  Slow speed control - 20 long parallel lines, &lt; 1m apart, and you have to maneuver your bike down them without putting your feet down and without exceeding some minimum speed.

L-ascorbic acid is a highly unstable, fussy little madam, it should be at the right percentage, pH and with the right synergistic ingredients not to begin degrading within hours, to penetrate the skin and to remain active in the skin for as long as possible. As L-AA degrades it can get increasingly acidic leaving you at risk of irritation or even mild burns.

Honestly as someone who has worked in hospital pharmacy and research laboratories I cannot understand why a sub that markets itself as *""using science to help your skin""* would advocate a bodge. I know many other amateur formulators who feel the same about such recipes - the excellent moderator of /r/DIYbeauty/ for example.

Do you have racial tolerance if expression of racial intolerance is illegal, or do you have internalised intolerance? If I can't shout ""I HATE BLACK PEOPLE"" without going to jail I probably won't, but I can still avoid treating them fairly on a day to day basis without repercussion most of the time.

&gt;I don't look at it as a rights question ('rights' are a legal construct), I look at it as 'what produces long term social and economic stability').

Fair enough. I'm guessing you're in favour of a China style system where you have fairly strong government (where required) and the state entity pretty much self-sustains and self-selects?

&gt;Imagine if the US hadn't introduced civil rights legislation! They'd have ended up with a country politically torn in two for decades. This isn't good for business or development.

I just don't believe in forcing people to be moral when they're being immoral in ways which aren't actively harming others, and can't see any rational justification for forcing people to serve blacks but not outlawing adultery or saying nasty things to people.

The economic situation in Europe in such that the jobs in Britain that years ago would have been filled with British workers are now being fought over by workers from all over Europe. This happens for both skilled and unskilled jobs, but the effect on the unskilled sectors is far more pronounced, because the opportunities of the Britons who compete for those jobs are more limited than those of their richer countrymen. In other words for unskilled jobs the pool of candidates has expanded without equivalent growth in vacancies.

If you're a cut-throat capitalist I could understand why you wouldn't care much about that, and come out with statement's such as the one below from Varpae:

&gt; If you're losing a job to a newly-immigrated, Polish-born worker with a terrible record and who can't speak English, then maybe you're just not that good of a candidate.

But this is to assume an unlikely amount of agency on the part of unskilled Britons. What is actually happening is that unskilled jobs are increasingly becoming a buyers market. And as it becomes harder to get a job the ability of those unskilled workers to bargain over working conditions and improve their skills to rise upwards shrinks. 

That many people who I suspect are left-wing have adopted neoliberal rhetoric over migration shows a lack of perspective on an issue that is wreaking havoc on the working classes, and pushing them right towards the very party the left hates – Ukip.

If I were you, you need to decide what you want to do - living the high life in London (and yes, eating at restaurants more than once a month counts as living the high life) - or saving up to move to Zone 3.

Out here in the wilds that is W12, you can easily get a [reasonable two-bed flat (or bigger) for £400k](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/find.html?searchType=SALE&amp;locationIdentifier=REGION%5E85398&amp;insId=1&amp;radius=1.0&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=400000&amp;minBedrooms=2&amp;maxBedrooms=&amp;displayPropertyType=&amp;maxDaysSinceAdded=&amp;_includeSSTC=on&amp;sortByPriceDescending=&amp;primaryDisplayPropertyType=&amp;secondaryDisplayPropertyType=&amp;oldDisplayPropertyType=&amp;oldPrimaryDisplayPropertyType=&amp;newHome=&amp;auction=false). Go further out to Ealing in Zone 3, that's down to £300k. 

I'm managing to feed three months on one salary that's less than yours in W12, so if I can manage it, I'm sure you can. To be fair, I haven't seen a ""proper"" restaurant for about 4 years, but that was never that important to me.

You have to decide what's a priority, and work towards it. So if you want to save money so you can find a nicer/cheaper place to live and raise a child:

- find somewhere cheaper to live. Move out to Zone 3 or 4, where you'll find landlords are just less greedy.
- don't eat out so much - or if you HAVE to eat out, eat out in the pub. A pub is much cheaper than a restaurant (although not by much!)
- Investigate in [shared ownership](http://www.sharetobuy.com) (where you own a bit of a property, and a housing association owns the rest) - although with your combined income, you're probably above their criteria.

Looking for a little advice. 

In August 2013 I took out a mobile phone contract with Vodafone (but through Phones4U, which has now dissolved). I stopped making the payments because I was broke, plus I had been given a work phone which I just used everything for (still do). I totally forgot about this until now. Checked my credit report on Experian this morning and it says this is ~~lasted~~ listed as a default on my account, which I believe is a pretty darn bad thing to have (like, I'll never get credit on anything until this is gone?). The Default date is 02/05/2014 and it's for £229. 

The default date is very close the date that P4U dissolved (a couple of months off) so I called Vodafone this morning to say they the payments had stopped being taken and I assumed it was because of P4U ending, and as I didn't need the phone (because of work phone) I thought it had just terminated. I am saying therefore that I think the default was ""logged"" in error and I would like them to remove it. They have pointed me towards a debt collection agency to which they have sold the debt. 


* Am I correct in thinking the only people which could remove this marker is Voda?
* Is my plan about blaming the situation on the ending of P4U stupid?
* Is there an easy / easier way to get this removed from my credit score. 

I am a single male 27 living in London; 5 years employed at the same company; basic salary of £40k (plus commission on top; last year ~£45k gross). I have the money to pay it off, but all I care about is getting this marker removed from my credit score. Any ideas, suggestions or comments welcome.

null,false,formerly_LTRLLTRL,1953,"#25",null,"Any attempt at discourse on r/soccer on days like yesterday are just a waste of time. It is the most mindless sub when it comes to polarizing issues. I've been baited before but I wasn't going anywhere near it last night.  The great thing is that it'll all be forgotten in 24 hours. This isn't the first hate-fest, and it won't be the last, but come tomorrow's ""Free Talk"" ridiculousness, everyone will be best friends again. 

I've been trying to figure out WHY it's such an awful and antagonistic place. It's not size as is often said - r/nfl is the biggest sports subreddit and it's an amazingly civil, respectful, and productive board. I never post, just lurk occasionally during the season, but I recommend you check it out, you'd be amazed at the civility of the place.  

I think the issue starts at what you said about the desire for tribal splits.  Especially foreign fans have this fascination with being the biggest fan they can be, to prove themselves to whoever. They'll criticize hooliganism but ultimately they want to be in their own Green Street Hooligans reality. That manifests itself in tribal hatred that most have never actually experienced. 

And that's the second point. How many people do you suppose experience football primarily if not exclusively on the Internet? I'm going 75% of r/soccer.  Unlike r/nfl, where people live in the regions of the teams they support and have most likely attended games, r/soccer is a collection of wannabes and try-hards. It's fine that you've never seen your team play, or even that your experience with your club is on streams or social media, but don't pretend that you're part of the supporting culture of you can't even be bothered to seek out people in your area who share the same interest. What you see is people living out their distorted realities on the Internet, and having to shout the loudest (and ultimately fall in line) to insinuate themselves. 

The other problem is moderation. R/soccer is a horribly run place. The mods are just as delusional as the majority of the bunch and think that antagonizing each other over sometimes trivial, sometimes serious issues can be played off as ""banter.""  

Basically r/soccer is everything but a forum for football fans. It's a place where try-hards can pound their chests and pretend if only for a moment that they're part of something they're not.

Participation amongst 18-24 year olds has been decreasing since at least 1964. The political landscape is wildly different to then, so to accuse the system of being impotent doesn't reflect the massive changes that society has faced in over half a century.

Participation for the 55-64 and 65+ groups is much closer to consistency. Participation is also greater with age. So those not voting at 18 start voting later in life.

&gt; No. This is not true.

We are talking about unsafe seats. Here the margins are small, so the possibility of young people voting (participation in 2010 was 52%, prior to that its been as low as 38%) can lead to people losing their seat. So double if not more of the numbers of young can still vote.

I guess, an article on a player that has improved under a manager and system in which all our players have improved is a bit of a stretch for me.

A lot of the bleating going on over Clarkson is from people who don't seem to realise he has a media, public personality which may very well be an overly-extreme, bufoonish version of his actual, private persona.

Why it's seen as any more controversial than other public comedians and journos, I don't know. 

I'm also disappointed at this latest move, especially the cancellation of TG. While the show has had problems of its own for a while - repetitive, over-scripted rather than the still-scripted-but-slightly-more- natural feel of a few series' ago - it was pulling it back round in this latest series and was becoming genuinely enjoyable again. People can say what they want about TG but it genuinely is the Beeb's flagship show, and it's a shame that this has all had to come about because love him or hate him, Clarkson is basically the face of the show. 

FWIW, I'm a girl - That shouldn't make any difference, but I've seen lots of venom towards TG/Clarkson in general from the bang-to-rights eco leftie-veggie-organic-feminist-delete as you will- set who are dancing with glee that those terrible, terrible petrolheads have been pulled from the screen.

Substantively: I understand your point, but shouldn't this be a discussion the community has as a whole? It may be that the previous discussions around the topic are framed as a demand that other users might not share, as with the serious tag, and so they haven't taken off. There might be reasonable suggestions for making it less toxic that I, you guys, other users, etc. just haven't considered. It may also just provide a forum for people who wouldn't otherwise complain about the sub to share their frustration; this sort of discussion could generate [mutual recognition of an underlying threshold for reform](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1991/kuran1991a.pdf) (PDF link) wherein everybody recognizes that they'd prefer a massive change. Or, alternatively, it could just make public the fact that the majority prefer the sub the way it is, giving others (like myself) the knowledge that we're in the minority and are welcome to leave.

First thing is the end of this overhype. All the media and commentators had been saying for ages that Chelsea were Europe contenders and had the perfect team etc. etc., when frankly we didn't. Yes we're doing things better than most, but if you look at the results, we haven't gone toe to toe with a team of equal size and done anything extraordinary yet. 2 draws with PSG, drew twice with City, home and away, beat Liverpool only when they were shit at the start, since then two draws (with a win aet), drew with Man U who even Arsenal and Swansea could beat at Old Trafford. My point is that we're not losing, but we're not making our mark on the league, and that's what a champions league team should do. This loss will shatter that idea that Chelsea are perfect and hopefully force us into becoming a team that doesn't just scrape hard working draws with big teams but actually takes them on and betters them (as much as it pains me to say), like Arsenal did at OT.

Also, this means we now can focus on the league - there was a terrifying fixture potentiality where we would have a CL semi fincal divided by a Liverpool game, like last year, and the potential to be fucked over by the 'pool would be really dangerous for league and CL.

Hopefully now we can see Cuadrado and the youth maybe get some games, with a better rested squad, we can start winning earlier and hopefully getting some long-term development going. I'd like to see more variety, try Willian in the centre again (as we saw last night his wing play is dangerously predictable). 

Also let's not forget who we are. We are Chelsea, we feed off the hatred of the other clubs, it's what makes us stronger. We will never be the plucky underdogs after the Di Matteo times, and we should embrace that.

Just generally positively let's not forget how good we have it. We've got a manager we all love (his comments after the game were so fantastic), young players like Zouma, Courtois and Hazard (only just 24 for crying out loud) who are some of the best players anywhere.

Our rivals are floundering, van Gaal has Man U playing long-ball to Fellaini, Man City are aging and dependent on Yaya and Super Frank for anything. Arsenal, well... are Arsenal, We've killed the shit from Spurs for this year, and Liverpool still have a captain who has to be benched for them to win.

Nah, roaming data costs are crazy: £5 per 15mb is what Vodafone charge for Australia for example. If your sister had been roaming in Australia her bill would have been... significantly higher.

If she genuinely can't afford it then defaulting may be an option but it should be a last resort and only come after every other option has been exhausted -- begging, payment plans... -- she should not consider walking away unless they have rejected every alternative.

It's just like Townsend. He has worked on his decision making in the final third, but because he has the reputation for making bad decisions, any time he does make a bad decision (which all players do at times) everyone jumps all over it.

My partner and I have a combined income of less than £30k, but we pay £1100 in rent (zone 1) and still manage to save or pay for a holiday or two each year. We also eat out occasionally and don't live a depressingly frugal life. I couldn't even imagine having the kind of income you have, while I used to be paid more (pay cut for career change), it wasn't even close and I managed to save nearly half my income each month. You're extremely lucky to be one of the few couples in London who do have a realistic possibility of saving for a mortgage. 

It seems to me like there may be areas that you're spending a lot but don't realise. Make a spreadsheet and meticulously write down each thing you buy for 30 days or even 2 weeks if you find it difficult. You might well find you're spending well over £150 a month on lunches or coffees alone or something like that. If I had to explain why I'm not broke here are some tips: 

- Packed lunches or creative lunches (you can get the ingredients to put together some good sandwiches, salads, nachos, etc. for a whole week for the cost of one takeaway lunch from somewhere like pret)
- Utilities - I have a £10 sim only contract and hand me down (free) iPhone, very good broadband deal, then only pay for gas/elec, netflix, water and council tax. TV license and cable subscription are useless to us and expensive. 
- Cheap days out - try swapping one or two meals out each fortnight with a picnic or something similar, you can still have nice Waitrose food/wine for likely less than 1/3 of what you pay on a meal
- Cheap train tickets. Are you buying them in advance? 
- Monthly food deliveries - we try to go to the supermarket no more than once a week, and plan ahead and get a month or fortnight's shop online. Planning meals and not just buying ""everything you need for fajitas"" every night from the local expensive urban minimarket saves a lot of money. 
- If you use Ocado (which we do), you can sort items by ""price per kg"", which is the best way to avoid being duped by poor value offers and such. For example sliced edam cheese is usually £6-7 per kg, whereas some regular / cheap looking cheddar can be up to £20 per kg!
- Only buy one or two coffees out each week, at the weekend, as a treat. We go out of our way to go to Italian delis and good coffee places, and ignore crappy pret / starbucks coffee the rest of the time!
- Only buy about 1-2 personal items a month e.g. item of clothing, book, game etc. Any more and we wouldn't be able to move in our flat for stuff.

I'm not sure if that seems like extreme measures for you, but we're happy, and don't want for many things at all. 

I'm at a loss as to how you are unable to save but perhaps those are things you could consider. The only way you can really know is to track your spending and look at the high / unnecessary outgoings. You may not wish to cut down on some things, but consider that by the sounds of it most people live without them anyway.

So the event didn't work out quite as either I or my boss had expected.

However, there was the added bonus that along with Moreno there was Javi Manquillo, Jose Enrique (of course lol), Gazieka Mendieta and Guillem Balague.

I'd hoped to be able to at least go on the record a little bit with them, but to no avail.

Nevertheless it was really nice to chat football with them - Enrique speaks the best English of the players so chatted to him for a while about football, and Newcastle because I know the club quite well. Then he introduced me to Moreno, whose English is pretty poor, and he went to introduce me to his brother but I was recognised him myself and introduced myself. Moreno was like ""how you know him?"" and I was like Instagram man...he thought I was a bit weird.

Manquillo was busy posing for photos but we had a little chat. Balgue is a big hero of mine so we talked for a while, and I had hoped to talk to Mendieta for longer but there it is, there was too much wine flying around for anyone to stay long.

There are probably several other solicitors on here who may be more familiar with inquest proceedings than I, but I have attended a handful and I am familiar with the format.

In my view the coroner is referring to **reporting on the inquest proceedings**, not people generally making comments **about** the inquests. As an example, a blog analysing the witness evidence of a particular witness with a conclusion that they have not been honest would be reporting **on** the inquest. 

Distinguish this from a Reddit post where users are talking generally about Duckenfield.

In my view that is completely wrong and is actually counter-productive to the campaign since it actually discourages people from talking about what is a very important current issue.

These sorts of tables give students easy answers on where to go that really aren't any sort of answer at all. 

You can get some useful information when you break rankings down to subject areas and look at what is strong and what is weak for a uni but then you just need to go find another source to see where they get their score from. Some things rankings generally cover well, some things very badly. For example student life is rarely touched and where it is, it's mostly done badly. Staff to student ratios are meaningless and some unis are constantly wriggling to get as many staff to count in them as possible while doing a bare minimum. 

The whole system is massively flawed though sadly the better alternatives all involve a lot of work and research for each applicant. If you just look at a uni website it will only tell you what's good about them and every uni has something they can boast about. This year Edge Hill are the THE University of the Year, ever heard of them? I hadn't and only recently found out that you get there by nominating yourself.

We didn't loose either of the two matches against them and in the league the tactics would have been perfect. Our defense is still one of the best in the world and we're on track to win the league.

I'm also sick of constantly hearing that our team is under performing when its been said all season long. Even Gary Neville showed himself to be quite fickle last night. It took him until the 85th minute when PSG scored to start laying into Chelsea but not a peep before that. Now i'm not saying we weren't poor, because we were. But here's the thing, all three goals scored by Psg were headers. Two of them were daft mistakes from our center backs not marking properly (not related to tactics) and the other one an unstoppable and incredibly lucky goal from David Luiz (again something that Mourinho doesn't have much control over). 

Make no mistake, PSG are a very good team with a lot of good players who really showed up in both games. They haven't been recognized in europe yet for the team that they are because WE put them out last time. There's no logic in pointing out that they had one less man because there's too many variables to simply say that we would have lost worse. I could argue that it forced them so sit deep when they would have otherwise been desperate to get forward or that it completely changed the mentality of the game -them seeing themselves as under dogs with a fight on their hands whilst we think we can relax. 

So yeah, bad performance and maybe we do have a problem with getting motivated but its incredibly short sighted and foolish to question the tactics of Mourinho over this one game when we're top of the league, were unfortunate to be put out on goal and its worked for years.

But everything ends, nothing lasts forever. It has to an end at some point. What if Clarkson dies? That will happen at some point. The show, as it is, will end.

I think what people are lamenting is change, and that's understandable, but change is inevitable and a constant in life. Top Gear may have ended prematurely for some but there will be something else to watch and it might even be better. I used to religiously watch Grange Hill when it first started back in the 70s, I loved that show, but it ended and I moved on anyway and all is well in the world.

What's wrong with it is that stormfront and coontown are constantly engaged in brigading and harassing ethnic minority subreddits, giving the moderators a hard time, and making it very difficult for them to operate like any other subreddit gets to operate. 

It is not fair that black-centric communities on reddit must remain hidden and invite only just because they are constantly harassed so much and it is the only way they can exist without brigaders posting and upvoting inflammatory content.

I think it's kind of interesting that when SRS calls people out on being racist and sexist everyone calls them thought police and ""cultural marxist SJWs"" but when /r/n\*\*\*\*rs and /r/greatapes post and upvote pictures of Trayvon Martin's corpse on black subreddits and call everyone on /r/blackgirls ""sheboons"" and ""n\*\*\*\*rs"" nobody bats a fucking eye. It got so bad that that /r/blackgirls subreddit was mostly abandoned. 

In fact, racist and sexist harassment got so bad on reddit that the moderators of /r/blackladies penned an open letter to the reddit admins, and about 30 other equality and minority groups co-signed the letter. The admins paid them lip-service. Then shadow banned one of the /r/blackladies moderators for brigading the chimpire. Yeah, you read that correctly. 

The open letter gained sufficient interest that they created a subreddit for discussing the open letter. Then subreddit was brigaded so relentlessly that the moderators had to set it to private. Yes, that's right, minorities on reddit cannot even discuss the fact that they are brigaded and harassed without getting brigaded and harassed.

So, that's the state of the site and that's what's wrong with it - if you're black and a woman expect to get a _very_ different reddit experience from a white guy, and that is totally unacceptable.

Practically speaking though, sitting down and coming up with a breakdown of what we spend and where, and what we could cut out would be a very useful exercise. And a strict budget. Thank you for the reality check.

They have a viable business plan. The problem with the big chains is that they have too much brand loyalty. This means that the own brand Tesco stuff generally has quite bland packaging compared to the branded one, if Tesco made good designs for their own brand stuff then the brands would be *pissed*, as people would be happy to just buy the own brand. The appearance of the packaging has a huge effect on how the person buying the product sees it.

The reason that Aldi and Lidl are doing so well is because they don't really care about the big brands, they don't *have* brand loyalty. The very cheap prices are clearly marked in big above the food, and all the food packaging is bright and colourful, just like the expensive brands in Asda or Tesco.

I don't think you seem to realise the effect/ freedom that non-ad-based funding has on shows.

&gt;Monopolized things? No.

Like the NHS, you're free to use other services - but arguing that 'you don't use' what is ultimately a public service for everyone usually gets the same reception, and rightfully so.

&gt;So tribesmen in Africa would like a word with you

Why, do they spend some of their time in the UK? A weak response - but since I obviously wasn't talking globally, I won't bother mentioning BBC Africa or the World Service...

&gt;This is somewhat redundant either way as a high number of users doesn't mean it's needed

You haven't actually demonstrated that it's not needed yet - but in any case, I could say the same about the NHS as a public service. Just because it can be rubbish, nobody is stopping you from spending more money elsewhere for a 'better' service...fortunately, most people recognise the 'public' in public service and don't resort to (so far) pretty weak redefinitions in order to avoid contributing at all. 

&gt;just that it's wanted and highly convenient.

Convenient as in 'cheaper than any other offering' - not that another offering that provides kids channels and associated websites with no advertising or tie-ins actually exists. But hey, *you* don't use those so who cares?

&gt;versus something that is enjoyed, convenient but very much replaceable and changeable.

You have a  replacement the ad-free example I gave above, that's ready to go? I'm all ears. Then we can move onto the World Service, and other useful channels that nobody else offers - in fact there are so many that it speaks less about what the BBC provides and more about how far you've thought this through in order to justify your position.

&gt;I'm not the only person who doesn't own a TV

I'm not the only person that has never used the fire service. How about that.

At over 120bhp, no it can't be limited. You can only restrict to a minimum of half of its unrestricted output.

You mean the A licence. A1 is for 17-19 (:

Over the post-Snowden debates on mass surveillance one of the major difficulties has come down to different definitions of ""surveillance."" The Government's position, and that of the ISC, various MPs etc. is that ""surveillance"" only happens when a person actually looks at the information.

Other people are of the opinion that ""surveillance"" happens when someone looks at the information *or* their computer programmes scan through the information to look for patterns or sort it.

Which is why two MPs can stand up in the House of Commons, with access to the same data, and one says ""mass surveillance is not happening"" and the other says ""mass surveillance is happening.""

Yes I do think it is the American userbase and not &lt;20 year olds.

The majority of these Americans have;

* Never been to a game of the leagues they discuss. 
* Not been brought up in a country where football is the national sport and exposed to it from nearly birth.
* Have no real connection to the club.

This leads to hideously uninformed opinions that you simply wont get from people who have grown up in countries where the sport is a religion and frequently attend matches.

This is why we get so many meme posts and pathetic circlejerk opinions. The american users cannot connect with football on anything other than a very superficial level and are drawn into these facile opinions and posts. They lack the knowledge or experience to truly discuss the finer details of football (atmosphere, culture etc.). 

Because of this we get more and more awful posts, generic opinions and no real discussion. 

So yes i do think it would be a better place if we had a European only football subreddit. I make no attempt to hide that.

None of the other major sporting subreddits deal with a problem like /r/soccer does. I don't think that is a coincidence.  

American sporting culture and European sporting culture are very opposed. I feel the american influence on r/soccer is toxic and I hate it.

Tony Blair, because he was born and grew up there, Gordon Brown because he was born and lived there most of his life and David Cameron because his Grandfather was Scottish. However, its important to note that DC considers himself English.

John Major and Thatcher before those three were both English, but before them James Callaghan, while born and raised in England became PM when he was running for a seat in Cardiff (Wales), so I guess in a way he was ""From Wales"".

For arguments sake let's just assume that nationality is based on where you were born.

**Scotland**; **John Stuart**, 3rd Earl of Bute (26 May 1762 – 16 April 1763), **George Hamilton-Gordo**n, 4th Earl of Aberdeen (19 December 1852 – 30 January 1855), **Arthur James Balfour** (11 July 1902 – 5 December 1905), **Henry Campbell-Bannerman** (5 December 1905 – 3 April 1908), **James MacDonald** (5 June 1929 – 7 June 1935), **Tony Blair** (2 May 1997 – 27 June 2007), **Gordon Brown** (27 June 2007 — 11 May 2010). **TOTAL=7**

**Wales**; [No Prime Minister has actually ever been born in Wales, but as this article points out **David Llyod George** (6 December 1916 – 19 October 1922), one of Britain's finest pre-WW2 Prime Ministers, saw himself as Welsh and is generally regarded by history as being Welsh. ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/newsnight/michaelcrick/2010/06/which_prime_ministers_were_bor.html) **TOTAL=0 but kinda 1**

**Northern Ireland**; There has never been a Northern Irish Prime Minister for the U.K. This might be for a number of reasons but I feel the main factor is the fact that Northern Ireland only comprises of less than 3% percent of the U.K. population.

**England**; The rest are from England. [I won't name them all because I don't have the time and I can't really be bothered but here's a nice list of all the Prime Ministers if you'd like to see.]
(https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers) 

As an American you might think it's odd that England has dominated the U.K. PM seat for so long but it's important to remember that England has always had the highest population and because of that I think the people have always been a bit more biased to vote for English candidates. Also, Oxford really do stifle the PM seat and a lot of Oxford students and graduates have been English. It's a wonderful mixture of classism, a bit of national pride and plain simple demographics.

Hope this answered your question! I actually enjoyed looking this stuff up, so thanks /u/fwilli.

&gt;The term *crack* is ultimately derived from the [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English) *crak*, meaning ""loud conversation, bragging talk"".  A sense of *crack* found in Northern England and Scotland meaning ""conversation"" or ""news""  produces expressions such as ""What's the crack?"",  meaning ""how are you?"" or ""have you any news?"" The context involving ""news"" and ""gossip"" originated in [Northern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_English)  and [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language).  A book on the speech of Northern England published in 1825 equates *crack* with ""chat, conversation, news"".  The Scottish song ""The Wark o The Weavers"" which dates back to the early part of the 19th century, published by David Shaw, who died in 1856, has the opening line ""We're a' met thegither here tae sit and crack, Wi oor glasses in oor hands...""  A collection of folk songs from [Cumberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland) published in 1865 refers to villagers ""enjoying their crack"".  A glossary of [Lancashire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire) terms and phrases published in 1869 lists *crack* as meaning ""chat"",  as does a book on the local culture of [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) published in the same year.  Glossaries of the dialects of [Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire) (1878), [Cheshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire) (1886), and [Northumberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland) (1892) equate *crack* variously with ""conversation"", ""gossip"", and ""talk"".    These senses of the term entered [Hiberno-English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English) from Scots through [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) at some point in the mid-20th century and were then borrowed into Irish.

When I was out travelling around in the colonies (the one that put all that tea in cold water (Idiots!)), someone bought me this Charlie Brown mug right at the start of my journey to see a girl. I hated it for both it's colour and it's impracticability and treated it with as much respect by strapping it to the outside of the bag by the handle, hoping it would be lost in transit. I was going from NYC to Little Rock AR, with a changeover in Charlotte NC. Well, I got stuck in Charlotte and my bag went on without me. 

When I caught up with my bag and girl the next day, there was this splendidly shit, mustard-yellow mug, hanging off the strap, smug-as-fuck, like it had personally delivered itself on the back of a marshmallow. 

The mug earned enough respect in that moment, I figured it had earned the honour(s) of PG, ~~Typhoo~~ YORKSHIRE, Tetlee and the saintly Twinings and deserved to come back to Blighty with me. It hasn't failed me once yet (it hasn't broken to bits or fallen into the sun) and I'm sure it will remain the same ole' faithful it has been since summer '09.

Another option should the ones above not suffice is to talk to them about a repayment plan. So, instead of her owing £550 over the next month, they take that figure and you pay it off in installments over however many months are left on the contract. 

So, lets work this out. This bill will was accrued on the 4th month, meaning 20 months left to pay for. Split the £550 by 20 and add it to the £16 a month she would need to pay anyway and you get a much more manageable £43.50 a Month. 

That's not a great number, but this could be your best option if they refuse to budge. If you keep speaking to them, they might even agree to lower payments over an even longer period.

The more you restrict moment into and out of a country, the more inward looking it becomes. If the government decides for us who is desirable, we have lost all choice in the matter. If that happens, I want to be able to leave with ease and live somewhere else if I want to.

These are the types of comments that make me feel like i'm taking crazy pills. First half stats: 2 shots, 1 on target, 0 corners, 1 pk shout. The one time we put a good ball through the box from a wide position, nobody was in the center attacking the cross (out of position). Where are all these chances people keep speaking of? Maintaining attacking possession around the box is not the same as creating chances when the defending team has the attacking team completely contained. The fact that we could not get a decent shot off within 45 minutes of basically complete attacking possession, a portion of which was a man up, would suggest the exact opposite of what you are saying. 

This strategy of basically walking the ball around the corners of the box, never shooting &amp; never crossing has not been effective for us. We have struggled all season to kill off games by getting the second or third goal. This game is a perfect example of our struggle to create actual goal scoring opportunities from free play. We pull our central players wide providing no direct option, combined with having almost no movement off the ball and no real plan of attack. A lot of it has to do with offensive tactics, or a lack there of. 

Could you argue that pulling Costa wide was done on purpose to double Marquinhos? Probably. However, this happens quite a lot. Assuming it was done on purpose, was it effective to pull Costa wide to attack Marquinhos with Hazard: one paper, probably. actual game stats would suggest no.

&gt; I'm not the only person that has never used the fire service. How about that.

We've already covered that with the NHS. Your point is redundant. Both provably save lives daily - the BBC is primarily an entertainment service and is replaceable with other entertainment services. 

&gt; And now we're back to I-I-I. Why not give some examples based on what helps everyone?

Again, irrelevant. You're trying to change the goal posts and force me to fight for an argument I'm not making. I am included in 'everyone' and *I* do not need this entertainment service. Sorry if you're having a hard time with it, but it's not for me to apologise for. Everyone looks out for their own best interests: this is me looking out for mine.

Ah, the holy grail of, abroad. Mystical abroad. Whether it is Chile or Togo, abroad is where success is. 

Cheap shots aside, I've been living and working abroad for the past four years and it is not all daisies, especially for young people. Youth unemployment in Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and many other abroad type places all have record youth unemployment, often over 40%. These countries often are awash with cheap immigrant labour too. 

Another factor is the need to speak the language at a decent level. And then you have to overcome the fact that many businesses would rather hire their countryman than some foreigner. 

The reality of working abroad in most countries is that you need skills that are in demand, which makes abroad the same as everywhere fucking else. Lastly, many people who work abroad still struggle with the language and some never pick it up. It takes time and effort and practice, all of which can be hard to find when you work 9-5.

'Ethnicity' is not a good term here because it implies common social factors (as well as the genetic ones) that the blog wishes specifically to exclude, for example by looking at identical twins raised in different households.

I think there is a political game being played here which attempts to exclude the term 'race' from the discorse using the argument that it refers exlusively to the absurd idea that 'you can make meaningful judgments about a person's traits solely from the colour of their skin?'.

The purpose of the game is Orwellian in that it attempts to make certain matters more opaque and difficult to discuss.  In other words, it attempts to prevent thoughtcrime by making the thought difficult or impossible by manipulation of the language.

Nobody is jealous of Chelsea as a football club for the simple reason that you didn't build your success from the get-go so much as you bought it. Come on guys, be reasonable. You know that's much closer to the truth than the other way around. 

Were you a Chelsea fan before the russian? Good. Enjoy these successful years. Did you join Chelsea afterwards because you liked their success? Awesome, enjoy the success. But you cannot be a fan of this club and think that it's like the others. It's not. That's not necessarily bad, but it's necessarily different. This difference causes hate and disgust in other football fans across the world. Be it because they hate the capitalist way in football, Mourinho's personality, some of your players (Terry, Costa), or the success you have had. 

But if you're neutral for a moment and honest with yourselves, from an outsider perspective it's easy to pick up on things to hate about Chelsea. Not the least of which, recent racist events.

Furthermore, an A Licence is not going to make a fundamental difference to how safe I am on a bike.  Someone who's been driving for 10 + years and who has a CBT is more likely to be a safe rider than someone who's 18 and has an A1 - simply down to the distance they've travelled and the amount of road-craft they've learned simply by driving for 10 years.  

Therefore, why should I need to do an A license if a CBT fulfils my needs (i.e. provides me a piece of paper that I can wave at the police to demonstrate that I'm legally allowed to ride my 125cc ? )

Factor in the cost of lessons etc for the A license and it makes even less sense to me.  

An A license doesn't make you a safer rider if you're my age - I might benefit from som lessons and riding hours with an instructor, but the physical difference between myself with a CBT and myself with an A is that I have an additional line of ink on my driver's license - nothing more.",null,0,null,1426174785,null,0,false,0,cpcm53g,null,t3_2ypzwt,null,t1_cpcm53g,null,t1_cpclwry,null,null,null,1427720597,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Arguable, and you haven't provided any against yet.

&gt;and I'd like to see how that effects any impression of unbiased programming that it follows.

For a recent example, Top Gear. Try moving it to another channel that relies on car ads, and watch the content change. Again, this is one example of so many that the fact that you're asking reveals more than you realise.

&gt;""Please find me someone that's never seen a single BBC show, anywhere, ever.""

Yeah, in a sub about the **United Kingdom** talking about a license fee for the, er, UK public service. How about that. Pedantry - another example that gives away too much.

&gt;I don't use it. I don't need it. I don't need any more proof than that to satisfy myself. Perhaps you'd like to prove how I do need it?

I-I-I-my-I. Once again, it's a *Public Service*, not a private one.

&gt;Right. I don't use it, it's not crucial to my health

I-I-my.

&gt;or the day to day running of this country.

Arguable. Lots of people watch it every day. But then, it is for everyone and not. just. you.

&gt;You've yet to provide a decent argument why I do need it and if I don't

Actually I have - you're just ignoring them because they don't apply to you specifically...and in any case, I don't actually have to. You're the one arguing against the status quo without any real justification outside of your personal use. Which, as I've already pointed out more than once, is not what a public service is designed to do.

&gt;logically there are others who also don't

Logically there are others who never use the police, fire or other public services.

&gt;We shouldn't have to pay for it.

That's the first time you've used something more than 'I' - without any real thought outside of 'I don't do X, therefore others must not, why should I pay for others?'

&gt;It's not for me to provide this.

Since you're all for getting rid of the funding, actually it is. If you're going to assert that there are other offerings that are as cheap, offer no adverts at all and include websites/ radio as well, let's hear them. Remember that your alternative has to cover everyone in the country and their preferences as much as possible, not just yours.

&gt;I am in favour of researching further green energy and space travel  - doesn't mean I know a damn thing about how to go about them. I just know they're a good thing

For those parallels to hold, you have to demonstrate why the BBC is a *bad* thing, together with examples of better offerings, etc.

&gt;We've already covered that with the NHS.

Yes, it's a public service too.

&gt;Your point is redundant.

It was made to invalidate yours by demonstrating what a public service is and how it's not a chinese takeaway where you take the bits you want and throw away the rest, so that reply doesn't mean much until you've added some actual substance outside of your own viewing habits.

&gt; Both provably save lives daily

Both provide a *service* daily. 

&gt;the BBC is primarily an entertainment service and is replaceable with other entertainment services.

Is the OU (as well as other educational aspects) purely for entertainment? Is the news service entertainment? You keep saying it's replaceable, but don't back it up with any examples at all (and complain it's not your job when asked). 

&gt;Again, irrelevant.

Only if it's important for your outlook to hinge on the BBC not being a public service.

&gt;You're trying to change the goal posts and force me to fight for an argument I'm not making.

No, you're making an argument based purely on your viewing habits - you've set those goal posts all on your own by pretending that the BBC is something it isn't. Your assertion that it should therefore become a private service instead of public because 'you don't watch it' creates the argument, because that's not what it's for or how it's designed - and never has been, apart from when someone wants to quibble £12 a month on reddit.

&gt; I am included in 'everyone' and I do not need this entertainment service.

Included. Not represent. Big difference.

&gt; Sorry if you're having a hard time with it, but it's not for me to apologise for.

Don't apologise to me. I'm not the old lady who has less to watch because some bright spark thought he'd get away without funding it.

&gt;Everyone looks out for their own best interests

Oh, *now* you speak for everyone. And still it ain't true.

&gt;this is me looking out for mine.

Good luck with that.

&gt; King Arthur was getting ready to go on a Quest. He was worried about leaving his beautiful Queen Guinevere alone with all those lonely knights of the Round Table. So he went to his famous wizard, Merlin, for some advice. After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful and said to come back in a week and he'd see if he could come up with something.

&gt; A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt... except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. 'This is no good, Merlin!' the king exclaimed, 'Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?'

&gt; 'Ah, sire, just observe.' said Merlin as he searched his cluttered workbench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.

&gt; 'Merlin, you are a genius!' said the grateful monarch, 'Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected.' After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest.

&gt; Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection. Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Lancelot.

&gt;It is with immeasurable sadness that we announce that author Sir Terry Pratchett has died at the age of 66.

&gt;Larry Finlay, MD at Transworld Publishers:

&gt;""I was deeply saddened to learn that Sir Terry Pratchett has died. The world has lost one of its brightest, sharpest minds.

&gt;In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him. As all who read him know, Discworld was his vehicle to satirize this world: he did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humour and constant invention.

&gt;Terry faced his Alzheimer's disease (an 'embuggerance', as he called it) publicly and bravely. Over the last few years, it was his writing that sustained him. His legacy will endure for decades to come.

&gt;My sympathies go out to Terry's wife Lyn, their daughter Rhianna, to his close friend Rob Wilkins, and to all closest to him.""

&gt;Terry passed away in his home, with his cat sleeping on his bed surrounded by his family on 12th March 2015. Diagnosed with PCA^(1) in 2007, he battled the progressive disease with his trademark determination and creativity, and continued to write. He completed his last book, a new Discworld novel, in the summer of 2014, before succumbing to the final stages of the disease.

&gt;We ask that the family are left undisturbed at this distressing time.

What has happened according to the study is that although legal sales have fallen, illegal sales have substantially increased. 

It's worth mentioning that this study was commissioned by the tobacco companies but KPMG is a highly respected consultancy firm so it's worth keeping an open mind. 

As said earlier, a fair amount of the data produced from Australia is positive but it's still early days to say whether it has been a success or not and it's a little presumptuous to suggest that implementing the policy in the UK will have the exact same impact. 

I hope plain packaging will be a success, it's the potential for the black market to creep in that worries me. 

http://www.pmi.com/eng/media_center/documents/kpmg%20report%20on%20illicit%20trade%20australia.pdf

&gt;Figure 1.1 highlights that in the twelve months to the end
of June 2013 (LTM H1 2013), the level of illicit
consumption grew from 11.8% to 13.3% of total
consumption.
If all of this tobacco had been consumed in the legitimate
market it would have represented an excise amount
payable to Government of AUD1.0bn at current excise
rates.
The key driver of this growth has been a large
increase in the consumption of illicit manufactured
cigarettes, primarily in the form of contraband.
Counterfeit also appears to have increased.
This trend is also evident in seizures data provided by the
Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, by a
consumer survey conducted by Roy Morgan Research
and an empty pack survey conducted by MSIntelligence.
‘Illicit whites’ have emerged as a major form of
contraband this year. Manchester is currently the largest
illicit white brand in Australia; if it were sold legally in
Australia it would have a 1.3% market share.
(3)
This growth in the consumption of illicit manufactured
cigarettes has been concurrent with a reduction in
consumption of unbranded tobacco. The level of
consumption of this type of tobacco declined by 40%
between 2012 and LTM H1 2013.
These trends are supported by the observation that the
total consumption of tobacco (i.e. legal and illicit) appears
to be stable. Consumption between 2012 and LTM H1
2013 was flat compared to a longer term annual decline
between 2009 and LTM H1 2013 of 2.9%.",null,0,null,1426175345,null,0,false,0,cpcmhac,null,t3_2yovy7,null,t1_cpcmhac,null,t1_cpckzwo,null,null,null,1427720755,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

But that has no basis as far as a penalty fare goes. They say something like ""we try to keep queues down"" but it's still your responsibility to get there in enough time to buy a ticket. Especially if it's an obviously busy time (like 8am or 5pm)

&gt; There would have to be anyway, or there would never be any basis for appeal, as tickets are always available eventually, even if days later.

That's pretty bad nit picking. The rule is that the ticket office has to be open when you are trying to travel. If it's closed (and you can't buy from a machine) then that's good enough to pay on a train or at another station. Passing an open ticket office in a penalty fares area is enough for a penalty fare or prosecution to stand and the length of the queue doesn't seem to matter

&gt; That certainly makes sense, but there was no ticket office there. I had cash and a debit card but the machines weren't working at all. The nearest ticket office is a considerable distance away, through the tube station, which I had tapped-out of on my Oystercard. 

But your other comment says ""There is a ticket office on the surface at the mainline station"" - and that's good enough for the train company to say there was adequate buying facilities.

What station was this out of interest?

&gt;  If I had gone there I would certainly have missed my train, which wouldn't have been a reasonable outcome. I would have left a female friend waiting alone at night for 30-60 minutes, and missed the point of my trip. That's not a good outcome for a regular traveler who always pays his fare in normal circumstances, and who attempts to pay at his first opportunity, even when he could have just walked out of the station. 

None of this really matters as far as a penalty fare goes. It doesn't matter if you normally pay the fare, the fact (to them) is that you didn't do it this time. It's like a speeder saying ""I shouldn't get points because I normally don't speed""

I suspect that while you may be genuine, there will be people who use every excuse in the book to get out of actual fare evasion

&gt; I said all this to the appeal, but just got a crap standard response. I think they should at least consider the points I am making, but they haven't. I don't think that is too much to ask.

Probably because (in their opinion) they have decided that you were in the wrong

&gt; Anyway, it can be avoided if you are aware of your rights, so I hope this post helps someone.

No, training + practice + experience == safer riding.  

It's possible to get a car licence with a couple of hours training.  That doesn't make a person a safe car driver.  What makes them a safe car driver is the correct mental attitude and the experience of many hours behind the wheel.

Training for an A licence might make me aware of some hazards I wasn't aware of after watching numerous youtube videos or reading 'Proficient Motorcycling'.  But the scant few hours of training on how to effectively game a certification test are no comparison to hours in the saddle.  

I would be interested to see a breakdown of accident rates vs hours of driving / riding.  I suspect it would correlate more closely to experience than it would to training level.

An intermediate qualification would make sense, if the time requirements for it were not too strenuous.

&gt; Arguable. Lots of people watch it every day. But then, it is for everyone and not. just. you.

Sure they do, it's widely used. But the Apple iPhones are for everyone, not just me - doesn't mean they're a public service. 

Your entire argument hinges on the idea the BBC *must* be public. It's up to you to back up why. 

&gt; Actually I have - you're just ignoring them because they don't apply to you specifically...and in any case, I don't actually have to. 

Lol. 

&gt; You're the one arguing against the status quo...

Me and everyone in agreement with me, do some reading and you'll see I'm certainly not alone in my opinion on a forced tax to fund the BBC.

Which, as I've already pointed out more than once, is not what a public service is designed to do.

I've skipped some of the next points as you've missed them completely... 

&gt; Both provide a service daily. 

Sure they do - if you're hell bent on comparing apples and bananas they're both fruit but beyond that you're in trouble. Weren't you just mocking me for supposed pedantry earlier? 

&gt; No, you're making an argument based purely on your viewing habits

Unsurprisingly, yes. I don't much care about yours - they don't matter to me. Are you really this scared of losing the television you love so much? Is that what these long posts are about? 

&gt; Don't apologise to me. I'm not the old lady who has less to watch because some bright spark thought he'd get away without funding it.

Yes, I'm literally stealing from old ladies now. Well done you. 

Can we end this now? You're clutching at straws through and through - we both know there are private alternatives to most of what the BBC offers, or that the BBC could be re-modelled as a private entity in a similar fashion and funded accordingly. If you can't think of examples of that then you're either an idiot, incredibly sheltered or being deliberately ignorant. 

Either way, talking this through more is of no more value to me. Rather like the BBC.",null,0,null,1426175708,null,0,false,0,cpcmp5i,null,t3_2yo4j2,null,t1_cpcmp5i,null,t1_cpcm9m0,null,null,null,1427720857,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

you see, there was a 15 minute break after the first half where i assume mourinho spoke them. what happened? they proceeded to play cautious tame football the entire second half against a maimed 10-man team, they literally only had 3 shots in those 45 minutes. so, do you really think mourinho told them to go for it and they deliberately went against his word?

the only moment i saw the players play with drive, their own independent drive, was in the time between luiz's goal and hazard's penalty. what a coincidence that they'd immediately retreat to their inexplicable ultradefensive state after grabbing lead a second time, clearly that was *not* what mourinho intended whatsoever. man, these players sure do like going against their manager's orders.",null,0,null,1426175728,null,0,false,0,cpcmple,null,t3_2ysdfe,null,t1_cpcmple,null,t1_cpcma8i,null,null,null,1427720863,null,-2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-2,null

None of that matters though. The inquest is in the UK and conducted under the English legal system.

&gt; I dispute this. What damage does one cigarette on a Friday night do to me?

Even second hand smoke, really low levels of exposure, does significant damage. That's just how toxicology works, there are different dose-response curves for different drugs. Sometimes the risk goes up linear to the exposure, sometimes it jumps up at low doses, sometimes low doses are perfectly safe, then suddenly very dangerous. Cigarettes are one of those drugs where there is no safe dose. For instance, this study which found light to intermediate smoking was almost as bad as heavy smoking:

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I feel sorry for you so I will explain,

Basically a fly wheel is a very heavy wheel, they are used on many machines including your car. 

They store kinetic energy in the form of their rotating mass, they are basically a mechanical battery that can be powered by anything including you via pedal power. Way for understanding that no motor or external power other than your legs are going to be involved here in anyway, yet we can still potentially reach silly speeds for a bicycle.

Basically you charge this fly wheel by pedalling via series of gears, you can actually spin the fly wheel to silly speeds using high gear ratio's. You can then apply this flywheel as drive when needed which will propel your bicycle using all that energy you pedalled slowly over a long time into a short burst of very fast speed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOnjtEKArXk

This guy is using a flywheel to turn breaking power into a kers type system for speed boost, so the brakes turn their wasted energy to spin up a fly wheel which is then spun down applying forward motion to the bike when needed. Pretty clever.

Flywheel bicycles &amp; pretty much all fly wheel powered vehicles have some massive flaws, fly wheels are extremely dangerous as they can store high amounts of energy and when they crash kaboom. I'd personally not feel safe knowing that a flywheel is inches from my groin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lzraVXP-5KQ#t=37

They also act as gyroscopes &amp; can cause some very dreadful handling characteristics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H98BgRzpOM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=16 Think this but multiplied a 1000X. basically every time you accelerate the bike will try to turn very hard to the right &amp; every time you decelerate it will pull extremely hard to the left.

They are also very heavy so yeah you can go fast but you will still have to handle a really heavy bike.

There was a time where fly wheels were still preferred to electrical batteries but that has since passed, there was an entire bus that had no motor &amp; instead had a massive fly wheel that was powered by external motors at charging stations at certain bus stops. I did some study into modern fly wheel concept including frictionless flywheels that utilise magnets &amp; vacuums interesting stuff but I don't think your vehicle is going to have one instead of a battery any time soon, your power station/storage station might one day though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3wkoL5dII0",null,0,null,1426176365,null,0,1426177751,0,cpcn3cv,null,t3_2yp5k7,null,t1_cpcn3cv,null,t1_cpcmszo,null,null,null,1427721077,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

null,false,rivalin,null,null,null,"I'm sorry but get real, ""white"" companies, i.e big corporates etc, racially discriminate in favour of minorities in order to pad statistics. If they get a thousand qualified white candidates and a hundred qualified black candidates for each job, and hire black people and white people in equal numbers, I'd call that racism, and yet that sort of thing happens all the time in large companies attempting to ""improve diversity"".

People on the left claim that any inequality is due to discrimination (i.e. there can't be less women in tech fields because they are less inclined, less interested etc, it must be due to sexism etc etc). IN that case it's funny that almost every ethnic minority owned business I've seen operates racial discrimination on a massive level. All the taxi companies, ethnic restaurants, small supermarkets etc that hire exclusively from their own ethnic groups, but are never prosecuted for it.

For example, here's an article that mentions Medina Dairy, it's one of the largest dairies in the country, and it's in a town that is only 1% Muslim, and yet it employs an almost entirely Muslim labourers. Just coincidentally it is owned by a Muslim businessman. In employment law that would be overwhelming evidence of racial discrimination.

&gt; According to the 2001 census, out of the 31,015 residents of Windsor and Eton, only 448 are Muslim. That’s 1.4 per cent of the total population - one of the lowest ratios in the country.

And if I can only do the CBT a certain number of times ( 1 renewal for e.g ) then I'm forced to use it or lose it - at some cost to myself financially amongst other considerations.  

I think your idea of the intermediate licence has merit, but I can't think of a way to implement it that wouldn't be like an A license.  Perhaps the CBT needs to become stricter, with the result that there's less of a training gap between it and the A - I can't think of a way to implement an intermediate licence without a theory section on roadcraft. 

Maybe if the intermediate license was some form of endorsement that permitted you to permanently ride a 125cc (without learner plates but not on the motorway or with a pillion) - perhaps upgrading it to A would require resitting the theory test and then doing yard / road tests as the current A does, but then at least you'd have CBT riders doing their theory?

I dunno.  It's a tough question.

It's inaccurate in that there's no clear boundary of what separates the classical 'races', as genetic diversity within these classic populations can be greater than the differences between them and others. The classic example is the immense genetic diversity within Africa among 'blacks' that renders some African ethnic populations more diverse between each other than they are to some Caucasian populations.

It's loaded because the word 'race' in modern society is chiefly defined around the colour of one's skin, which is a nearly useless discriminator.

It carries baggage for the same reason the words negro and moron carry baggage. We don't use those terms in sociology anymore because they've become derogatory and technically meaningless. Such is the fate of 'black' and 'white'.

The confluence of cultural and genetic factors encompassed within the term ethnicity is then the most holistic and meaningful way to describe the sum differences between human populations. If you want to discuss genetic differences, use the word genotype.

In any case the argument is bollocks. You cannot claim that mass interception and filtering of messages is not surveillance. It absolutely is because any comunication you make is liable to caught and read, even if totally innocous. Or are they going to claim that a human written algorythm is so accurate as to never generate false positives?

Anyone who thinks they are deleting data is totally deluded. The actual raw dated might be deleted but the metadata is not. The metadata is like gold dust to these cunts. It's kept indefinitely or as long as is physically possible. Almost definitely the data is streamed up to the NSA for storage anyway so even if GCHQ deleted it, the NSA would have a nice copy.

Now my brother did the maths test they set and was immediately put into the top set - but I did it and they lost the grade or something so just put me in the bottom set where it was insanely easy.

The teachers immediately realised it was a mistake but it still took them like a month to move me to the top set and that was a month of endless piss-taking from my brother :P

I am not looking at just shots, but yes, stats do paint a clear picture at the end of the day. I am also analyzing how we attacked and how familiar it looked to our current style of play.

Look, i'm not going to sit here and say that we had absolutely no opportunity to break down that side and score during the game - had the right pass or the right touch been executed. But to say that what we did worked well in the form of creating clear goal scoring opportunities would be a complete lie. Yes, we were very effective in maintaining attacking possession, as usual. But no, we were not effective in creating many goal scoring opportunities, as usual. 

All i'm pointing out are patterns that are continuing to repeat themselves. Most of which having to do with attacking tactics. We have attacking players who are considered to be among the best in the world. Why is executing 1 or 2 creative chances a game being considered good? Aside from when Hazard has the ball at his feet, we rarely look threatening anymore. In most cases, we attack fast and then stop the ball at the edge of the box. We refuse to cross it when the central players get in the area while also refusing to take any shots when they open up (and no I don't count Ramires' left foot from 30 out as a goal scoring opportunity).

As an ethnic minority, I believe this to be the worst and most offensive thing that I have ever heard from this man. He actually thinks racism is over??? Look at how much we are disproportionately stopped and searched by police, how we have higher conviction rates and longer prison sentences when compared to the *same crimes* committed by white people, the lack of representation in the media, the higher rates of unemployment. Just because we're not being openly discriminated against and being called niggers and pakis doesn't mean that we are not being considerably but subtly discriminated against.

Farage wants to remove racial equality laws, and allow businesses and individuals to legally prevent people from being employed or using their services purely due to their skin colour. He believes this won't cause problems because racism is over, and that UKIP 'doesn't see colour' - despite elected representatives of his own party expressing their disdain for 'negroes' and a desire for Lenny Henry to 'go back to a black country'. Farage and his party are trying to turn the majority against ethnic minorities, back as it was in the 70s and 80s.

You are right in saying that everybody who pays tax is entitled to use the road, but by foot or on a bicycle. Those tax payers are not entitled to use the road if they have been banned using it in a car or motorcycle or have not undergone the required training.

If an individual wishes to drive, they do so on the understanding that they are not able to ""jump in a car"" whenever they want to perform routine daily tasks. It is not feasible to have somebody with the required competencies at your side at all times for you to commute and work using a car. The same should be for motorcycles up to the point of passing a test. I think the A1 should, by law, have to be a requirement to ride on the UK roads. The A2 should be an automatic entitlement upon age restrictions being met, but the rider should in my opinion have to undergo the testing process again (minus the theory) to obtain teh full A license. This will give the rider the required training to handle a much more powerful machine.

I think it is rediculous that we have such unskilled road users. I lump a good portion of cyclists into this too. Contrary to what I said above about cyclists being entitled to use the road, I think this should definitely be changed to that they too have to undergo some sort of test from the age of 13 to allow them to ride on the public highway, including giving the rider a registration number that is specific to rider, not vehicle.",null,0,null,1426178238,null,0,false,0,cpco8vh,null,t3_2yjsjq,null,t1_cpco8vh,null,t1_cpbijtm,null,null,null,1427721615,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

- Cesc went missing for most of the second half. 

- I hate Veratti with a passion. Sure he's good at what he doea. But he plays in a violent manner to me and then gets this extremely smug look on his face when he gets called for a foul. He got in Eden's face after catching him from behind with clear contact on the leg (yellow card incident I believe) but decided to act tough about it.

- Why was Costa not taken off for Remy around 75 mins? Why didn't Cuadrado play? Why sub out Matic for Zouma??

- We play SO DEFENSIVE AND SCARED against these ""big bad teams"".. Sure we almost got burned a couple times (Cavani's chance) but to get that complacent when up a player is just unacceptable. 

I hope the players and Mou understand that this was a big wasted opportunity. Sure, now claiming the league will be the main focus now, but in order to hang with the big boys of Europe you have to be able to remain competitive in both.

And if I'm being absolutely honest, Costa is starting to get on my nerves. No wonder people hate him. Sure I love him cause he plays for us, but grow the hell up dude.

&gt;Each owner is effectively a despotic monarch on their own land who has an absolute say on who can enter and what they can do.

This is simply and utterly false. I'm not even gonna go into why this idea wouldn't work in anarcho-capitalism, because we're talking about mainstream libertarianism. And why wouldn't this work in mainstream libertarianism? Because you have a government that prevents coercion (ironically by being coercive, but that's ok because it's well regarded as a favourable expedient in a society under certain circumstances.). There is literally no libertarian that says it's ok to allow powerful individuals to have the power to coerce others into doing whatever they want. The entire principle of libertarianism (and by extension capitalism) is that the only lawful human exchanges are those that are voluntary. 

You give some convoluted example, and I assume you are assuming that under libertarianism if you work for a company then you have no power to leave if they don't want you to. Right? Because that's absurd. The only way the market can work is when it is voluntary. What would happen if someone was held against their will and forced to work? Well then the government would become involved. We have documents with sets of rights that are universal and this idea is favoured hugely in libertarian circles. What Libertarians don't like is when governments impose someone else's supposed rights on another individual. For instance, the government forcing a company to take on a worker (when the company doesn't want to) is very different to a company being free to discriminate (and all the benefits/downsides that come with that discrimination).

&gt;but when every scrap of land is privately owned and the ownership becomes massively concentrated under an absentee-owning clique

You're assuming that private =/= owned by individuals. Well that's simply false. Any house that is owned by an individual is defined as private property.

They've been consistent all season. I didn't honestly have the highest opinion of Dave in the beginning, but watching him boss the left side has been a lovely sight to see. Sure he'll make stupid challenges at times but if you noticed, not many goals come from the side he's covering. 

Hazard is a wizard. I'm convinced of it. The ball sticks to his feet like glue but he has no one to play with really. Costa is usually making runs into the box as are Oscar and Willian, leaving Hazard to have to dribble around to create space or him getting fouled. It's fucking pathetic. 

Terry has been in better form this season over last year IMO. His positioning is near perfect every time and has few bad games. I always hoped Cahill would have learned from him. I loved Cahill haha. 

Courtois I'm not really sold on just yet. He's a great keeper at such a young age which is glorious, but I just don't feel as comfortable with him in goal as I do with Cech. Something about Cech's presence makes me feel a lot safer.

null,false,wastingair,null,null,null,"Matic going off injured was a real blow for us, once he went we lost a lot of drive. Fabregas as good as he is, just doesn't provide the running you need in CM. Especially in a 4-2-3-1. 4-3-3 he'd get away with it if he was the furthest forward in the 3

Costa has been missing recently, he keeps drifting out wide and we have the same problem we had with Torres

Zouma as amazing as he is, is clearly not suited to CDM, Brilliant CB, but cannot play DM very well. Not faulting him at all, I think Jose is a bit dim for playing him there, bu given the circumstances it made sense

And lastly, as much as I love jose, I think he really needs to change tactics and formation. I think we play much better with a 4-3-3. Same back 4, Fabregas in the middle, slightly ahead of Matic and Ramires/Mikel, then have Hazard LW, Willian RW, Costa in the middle. I think Oscar could play out wide, or swap in for Fabregas. The main thing is that Hazard and Willian need to move up the pitch more. Costa gets left isolated and frustrated for most of the night otherwise. I get that it'll leave us exposed, but pressing Dave/Iva up so much leaves us exposed anyway, so I don't see why we can't sacrifice that overlap and have a more attacking formation

Also, only Hazard/Costa actually took defenders on. Is fabregas/Willian unable to run at/past defenders or something? I remember Willians first few games for us, he was really going at defenders and was excellent. He really put them under pressure and intimidated them, I haven't seen that as of late, would like to see him gain that confidence again as I know he's very talented

My point is, who exactly is moving into that space that was opened up? I understand that somebody should be, but the answer in most cases is nobody. There is rarely any movement off the ball to begin with, there is almost never anyone moving to get ahead in open space from a central position (outside of a 1-2). We are so defensively focused that our central midfielders rarely attack the box. Threat potential only exists when your tactics aren't predictable. We were completely contained in every scenario, except for maybe two in which Hazard had a 1-2 or azpil made an overlapping run. Even then, when we did actually break down the wing and put the ball across, there was absolutely no one in the center of the box in support or to attack the ball. This was because Costa was recovering from being in a wide position and the central midfielders were anticipating a counter instead of getting into dangerous areas.

I rarely go to r/soccer for a constructive convo cause I get riled up by Madrid fans talking shit so I end up talking shit back. The only place I really give a well thought opinion is on barca Forum a different website all together plus there are no down votes on forums so everybody sees it..

I struggle to find an analogy, but perhaps you could compare ""colour-blindness"" to the US military's ""don't ask don't tell"" policy on homosexuality vs just openly accepting everyone regardless of sexuality.

""Colour-blindness"" suggests that we want everyone to ""hide"" their ethnicity (if it were possible) so that people would not be able to be racist because they don't know who they're being racist towards. That's not ok. What we want is for everyone to be open and proud of their ethnicity and heritage and for others to treat them with respect for it, rather than in spite of it.

To give an example in everyday life: Say I speak to you on the street. I don't want you to imagine that I'm a white guy (assuming you're white) so that you'll treat me with respect.

Since government is occupied by a class of incredibly conservative, venal and self-serving people that don't represent the variety of people who actually live here, any random selection of people would fare better in making desicions about how society should run. 

Another more useful system would be direct democracy which involves abolishing the party system altogether and setting up a networked government which would enable every eligible citizen to vote on everything . This, I assume, is technologically possible. Why not do that? 

I'm sure there are many other ideas we could come up with to replace what is quite obviously a corrupt and ineffective system of governance that presently serves the interests of the rich and the big corporate powers at the expense of the general population.

null,false,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"Yeah, this is unsurprising.  One of the consequences of globalisation is the gradual smoothening out of worldwide wealth/consumption distribution.  Time was that global incomes used to look a bit like a bimodal peak, with europeans and americans consuming way more than everyone else (see eg the charts [here](http://www.voxeu.org/article/parametric-estimations-world-distribution-income)), but now that's smoothing out as the rest of the world catches up.  In practice what this means is that consumption of both goods and energy is being bid away from US and EU consumers by people in India, China, Brazil etc.  This is basically why EU energy consumption is back around 1990 levels, because believe me it's not all down to efficiency by a long shot.

So what this means is that wealth distribution is smoothing out.  So this is great for the people at the bottom who move up, but not so good for those of us at the top who suddenly have to move down to compensate for this (many more zero sum games in economics than people think).

Let's not also forget that global population in 1970 was roughly half what it is today, and last I checked the planet hadn't doubled in size recently.  Population growth is inherently inflationary, after all.

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"My experience is from five years in a comp, and two years at a grammar school's sixth form all within this century, in Birmingham.  I would definitely agree with the idea that there was a different culture, but I would vehemently disagree with the idea that it had anything to do with academic ability.

The biggest culture change for me was simply moving between social classes.  The comp was full of people from poorer backgrounds, mostly (maybe 50-70%?  I'm a poor judge of these things) Asian (largely Pakistani iirc), or living in the poorer Asian communities.  The grammar school, on the other hand, was almost entirely middle class.  Now admittedly the grammar school system in Birmingham has basically become a set of private schools for those families who can't quite afford to send all their kids to KES\*.  Most students don't take the eleven-plus, and only paid preps and external tutors will actually teach the contents of the exams, so there is a de-facto entrance fee.  The eleven-plus also has to be one of the weirder exams you can take, and I wouldn't mind seeing some evidence one day that it does correlate to future ability.

I also hear the ""bullying"" assertion fairly often.  I'm hugely sceptical of how true it is.  Certainly I was a bright, geeky kid, and I was bullied, but then I was also completely socially incapable for most of my life.  On the other hand, I was friends with a number of bright geeky kids at the comp, and - excepting a headteacher's son, a kid with Asperger's, and some girls (and I know enough of teen girls to know that I know nothing about teen girls) - none of them were really bullied.  Most kids mixed between different social standings fairly easily.  How much different kids got bullied didn't ever really seem to correlate to academic ability, and more to how socially awkward they were.  That's not to say that socially awkward kids should be bullied, but that's the experience I had at school.

To be honest, there wasn't a huge amount of contrast at the grammar school.  There, as well, both clever and non-clever kids mixed perfectly fine, and the social outcasts were generally those who struggled to talk to others, smelled of BO, or didn't grasp social norms.  I suspect that's the same everywhere.  There was some measure of class divide, but not anything that really mattered.  The biggest difference was the amount of vitriol reserved for other schools.  Sure, the other grammar schools were fair game, and there was that whole mock-rivalry between them that seemed fairly pointless to me, but seemed to entertain people.  But there were weird moments where a kid who'd suffered from some sort of mental condition and needed to be educated outside the school was just the butt of jokes about dragging the school down.  Or where everyone seemed to band together to decry various comps and sixth form schools in the area as shitholes.  Was that there in the comp school?  Probably not, although tbh I may not have really been paying attention to it.

I guess my point is that I'm sceptical of this ""institution for academics"" argument.  Kids don't really need to worry too much about their academic life.  What they need is to mix with other kids, to enjoy the various activities that they enjoy, and have fun.  They don't need to be pressured into all-controlling streams that may or may not even provide the needs and desires that they actually have for the future.  Is it some sort of waste if a kid who's fairly bright actually prefers something completely physical?  Where do the arts fit into this - they've generally not had much relation to academic ability?  There are positive arguments for streaming, but I just can't believe that they extend this far.

Crashing, especially when you're new, is always tough.

For now, take short rides - avoid any major traffic and generally assume everyone is trying to kill you (they are). 

Safe, progressive riding is a combination of experience and knowledge - take small steps and you'll be amazed what you can achieve

The community was formed in '51. (The ECSC was first proposed by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. He declared his aim was to ""make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible"")[http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm]

When I refer to ""the EU"", I refer to all stages of the EU. It was first a defence arrangement between Western European nations, then an economic union between nations of the west. Slowly, more integration happened: political, atomic, Schengen, justice, foreign affairs. This was all consolidated at the treaty of Lisbon in 2003, where the European we know today is at right now. 

The overarching goal has *always* been to make war on continental Europe impossible. It has been successful in that aspect.

For instance, last Saturday I was up at 7 am, worked outside in the freezing cold all day through until 6pm, and then spent four hours driving 240 miles home.  Most people don't do anything like that kind of job.

That's how they leave their impression on a foreign soil? At this day and age? And you guys even can't fathom that the other fans have a right to be pissed about that? Lot of the fans including myself is not from london hence I don't personally know any Chelsea fans but as a guy following the news everyone including me will associate Chelsea fans with a  racist view from now on. The whole world saw it man, C'mon! You fans are gonna get linked with racism whether you are a racist or not! This is a fact whether you like it or not. Learn to live with it!

Also,  regarding you being top of the table. Chelsea are a great team they deserve to be high up. But that's not my point. My point is your boss Mourinho and I will tell you why. He does not play free flowing/Beautiful football in important games where the whole world is watching. Regardless of how much talent he has in the squad he uses most of your player energy on not letting the opponents play football than utilizing that energy on playing football themselves. A club like Chelsea with your money and worldclass players it's simply pathetic. It kills every football fans to see the likes of Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar,  Willian etc not being able to play their normal game which is excelling in attack. That is solely down to JM. 

Chelsea were amazing to watch under Ancelotti. Your three pronged attack with Drogba, Anelka and Malouda along with Lampard was one of the best attacking English teams I've watched. Were they in their prime? Nope, they were in their late twenties or early thirties. This takes me to my third point. Your fucking owner sacked Ancelotti the season after he won you guys the first league and FA cup double in your history while playing some of the best football in the last decade. Read the last sentence again. 

Your fans' treatment of Rafa Benitez at the Bridge was pathetic and cowardly. He's won more European trophy for Chelsea in his half-year stint than Jose in all his years at Chelsea. You guys didn't deserve Rafa. 

You have all the right to support your team but also try to accept the fact that why hating Chelsea by most people is not just a big circlejerk.

I often use a camera (DriftHD) for the purpose of evidence (it's already come in useful once) but if you don't want to pay out for a camera then take pictures of the accident on your phone. DO NOT ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE MOVED UNTIL YOU HAVE PICTURES. Then get any witnesses' details. This is all assuming there's no medical emergency or whatever.

If you are partly at fault then the value of your claim will be reduced accordingly. E.g. If your bike is worth £500 and your injuries are worth £100 compensation but you are at 10% fault you will get £540 compensation. Similarly your company will pay 10% of the costs incurred to the other person. If you want to keep your NCB then you can pay your insurance company any costs they incur. (You still have to declare you had a part fault accident when you renew, but at least you have the NCB).

If the other party isn't insured, or they make off, then you can contact the Motor Insurance Bureau. All the decent folk like us who pay their insurance pay a bit extra that goes into a pot that is used in cases like this. Claiming from them is apparently very time consuming, and any minor mistakes on the forms would make you have to start the process again, so I'd recommend some sort of legal advice if you ever have to take that route.

Sounds you may have issues with your skin barrier (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out) - ideally root out the cause rather than try to treat the symptoms.

For breakouts around the mouth review your dental care products (drying alcohol, sulphate surfactants, fluoride can all be an issue). Also your shaving products (avoid sulphates, olefin sulfonates, anything alkaline, drying alcohol) and frequency/ technique (see /r/wicked_edge/).

For dry and sensitive skin do not over cleanse or over exfoliate (shaving exfoliates and the mouth area is more sensitive than the rest of the face). These can damage the skin barrier leaving it prone to irritation, allergies, dehydration and breakouts.

A moisturiser's job is to moisturise not prevent acne, they are apples and oranges so your options are very limited. Two possibilities that come to mind are CeraVe PM lotion or a zinc oxide moisturiser/ sunscreen combo. The lotion has 4% niacinamide (see the ingredients Wiki) as well aslipids to support skin barrier function tho may be too light for your dry skin.

Zinc oxide is naturally antibacterial and soothing/ calming so can help with acne as well as UV protection once spring hits (see 'sun protection' article in the sidebar). I cannot recommend a sunscreen but the next mega review topic will be sunscreen so keep your eyes open. 

Lastly ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle.

I read somewhere once about an American who said that Spurs were the English of equivalent of the Dodgers if the Dodgers had stayed in Brooklyn.

I know absolutely nothing about the Dodgers history in the sport of baseball, but when they were based in Brooklyn they used to play at Ebbets Field in Crown Heights, a neighborhood that used to be a Jewish ghetto and rapidly fell apart after the Dodgers left, became a nucleus for West-Indian and Caribbean immigrants, and segregated strictly along ethno-racial lines between the Orthodox Jews who remained after the secular population left and the black community. Racial tensions have sparked up a few times in the neighborhood throughout the 90s and early 2000s. 

Today Crown Heights is beginning to gentrify and has become a much safer/less racially tense place than it was about 20 years ago, but crime rates are still high depending on the block, what side of Eastern Parkway you're on, and what the color of your skin is. The site of Ebbets field is now a public housing project that bears its name and is reputed to be a hub of the city's gang-affiliated drug trade.

So the comparison with Tottenham's community history might not be that tenuous, the obvious exception being that Spurs stayed put and didn't destroy the dreams of their supporters and the local community that depended on them.

&gt;They have no real power and they turn a profit for the country. Why would you get rid of them?

Whst does that have to do with the civil wars and the only real chance to depose the monarchy?

Yes global tourism was just smashing in the lste 1600s. What foresight by the English people to reinstall the monarchy. They must have known they would go on to be a global empire, colonise huge swaths of the world and then make money off of tourist revenue to see the monarchy the colonists used to be under. What a brilliant 400 year plan. 

The royal family has real power. Through philanthropy and celebrity status they have influence over public opinion. Look at the influence even Harry has when he's not trotting around with swastikas on his arm. Who wouldn't want to be a helicopter pilot prince? You can't buy propoganda that good here in the states.

To say that the royal family has no power would be just as stupid as saying hollywood celebrities have no power. People love having celebrities to look up to and England's biggest celebrities are literally wearing the crown.

You all have a sort of double-think when it comes to the royal family. You claim they don't matter in the same sentence you spout off about them bringing in hundreds of millions of pounds. If they didn't matter and had no influence they wouldn't be bringing in the money.

I'm shocked by the communities vitriol from yesterdays result. I get banter and I can take that but the *pure hate* demonstrated by all the posts and comments are shocking. 

As of now if you look under the hot tab an informative and great post match article by [Zonal Marking] (http://www.zonalmarking.net/2015/03/12/chelsea-2-2-psg-aet-blanc-continues-with-starting-approach-despite-early-red-card/) is in 42nd place with 16 upvotes 

Meanwhile all the the other posts related to the match have comments shitting all over Chelsea, and you know what I can take the banter, its annoying but its banter, hell I love taking the piss out of Liverpool. What I get sick of is comments of hate being upvoted to the top on every thread relating to anything from the match. By now I'd like to get some post match discussion, because no matter who you support it was a FANTASTIC match!

It's incredibly ironic as so many posters on /r/soccer love to paint Chelsea as a hateful institution and yet they are blissfully ignornant of their own hypocrisy they display with upvoting comments like /u/esskaypee's

I think /r/soccer is the best football forum on the web and it has a really amazing community at times but it can also be the worst and most partisan online community I have ever experienced.

null,false,TheAmazingSausage,null,null,null,"Background: I'm a bit older than you and live down in Brighton.  So what I've gone through is similar but with possibly more commuting and slightly reduced rent prices (but actually the rest sounds very similar).  

I found that the only way for me to really get saving is to save first and then live off whatever is left.  

Here's what I'd do if I were you: get in touch with an IFA and get them to open you a ISA and just put £1,270 in a month (an ISA cap is £15,240 so £1,270 a month will give you a full ISA at the end of the year) [more info here: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/ISA-guide-savings-without-tax].  I wouldn't bother putting money in to a pension, so if you are - stop.  If you aren't then you doubly need to start saving cos you ain't getting younger, pal.  At the moment, in the UK, investing in property is the best way of planning for the future, way more so than pensions.  

On top of this - open up a savings account and setup a direct debit of between £50 - £250 a month to go in to this account , this'll be your rainy day fund - don't touch it unless you absolutely have to.  And - this may be over the top, but fuck it - I'm going to throw advice at you that helped me: to help with budgeting, change all of your bills (including rent, credit card repayments, student loans etc) and your ISA and savings account payments to come out a few days after your paycheck comes in each month.  Get paid on the first of the month?  Set all your bills to come out on the fifth etc  This way you don't have to worry about making sure you have enough cash in your account to cover you because all the necessary stuff comes out when you have a load of cash in your account and the rest is yours to do with as you like.  I don't know if your bank does this but I set mine up to send me text messages when I get near 0 or my overdraft limit - that way you know if you need to reel in your spending.

Want more advice?  Alright - open up a joint account with your girl and each month both of you put an agreed amount in - this will cover all your rent, bills, food shopping - whatever is considered a joint cost.  We put in slightly more than we need and then at the end of the month if there's any left in there, we splurge on a fancy meal.  This hasn't happened recently cos we bought a Porsche.  Don't buy a Porsche - they are expensive (and freaking awesome).

null,false,harrycambden14,null,null,null,"Thank you for the reply. I understand a moisturiser wouldn't actively prevent further acne, however as you mentioned, i find if i use the least irritating and most tolerant products, then this would in effect stop my skin from becoming more damaged as a result. 

I have a very simple routine based on this. I cleanse every night with Cerave hydrating cleanser, and moisturise now with Cerave moisturising lotion. I also tend to shave now every night as well, using the cleanser as a shaving product as it were, which avoids any further issues with harmful ingredients or mixing too many products. 

I keep thinking now due to the sheer volume of whiteheads/pustules i get every day, that i just need something, ideally oral medication, if not a gentle alternative product, to combat this problem. It just doesn't seem like typical acne that i see posted regularly, as i barely get any spots or blemishes anywehere else except where the thick hair would grow on my face.

Not everyone can tolerate daily shaving, the men in my family have ended up with designer stubble/ beards due to the sensitive skin we all have. No moisturiser or prescription drug will reverse over exfoliating caused by shaving. Contact dermatitis absolutely can present as what people think is straight up acne, or the two can mingle appearing as if one issue.

For breakouts around the mouth review your **dental care products** (drying alcohol, sulphate surfactants, fluoride can all be an issue). Also your shaving products (avoid sulphates, olefin sulfonates, anything alkaline, drying alcohol) **and frequency/ technique** (see /r/wicked_edge/).

For dry and sensitive skin do not over cleanse or over exfoliate (shaving exfoliates and the mouth area is more sensitive than the rest of the face). These can damage the skin barrier leaving it prone to irritation, allergies, dehydration and breakouts.

Not sure why you think oral medication is the next step, have you failed with anti inflammatory prescription actives like 4% niacinamide/ nicotinamide or 15% azelaic acid? Or with a zinc oxide sunscreen?

This kept Alzheimer's very much out of the public eye and guaranteed that research was woefully under-funded.

All that started to change recently. If I were to put a finger on when it changed I'd say it was around the time that Pratchett announced his diagnosis - he was lucky enough to be diagnosed while still mostly lucid and he absolutely refused to go quietly.

More detail in the IOCCO report:
&gt; One example of an error in this category is where an analyst had mistakenly continued to select the communications of an individual based overseas after the individual was known to have entered the United Kingdom. In one very serious case last year an employee at GCHQ deliberately undertook a number of unauthorised searches for related communications data. The employee was immediately suspended from duty on discovery of the illegitimate searches and a full investigation was launched. This abuse of the systems amounted to gross misconduct and the individual’s employment was terminated and vetting status withdrawn. Given
the actions undertaken, i.e. that the individual accessed GCHQ’s computers for an
unauthorised purpose, it is arguable that an offence under section 1 of the Computer
Misuse Act was also committed. This is the first known instance of deliberate abuse of

Of course, she suffers from having been presented as two different people -- the plot-device she was in Series 7, and the realistic, strong, but flawed person she became in Series 8, which is largely a matter of a) how the writers wrote her, and b) how much of a force for positive change the casting of Peter Capaldi has been for Series 8.  I think in writing for Capaldi, the writers found themselves with no alternative but to leverage Clara up, endowing her with an ego of her own, strong feelings of her own, and a *problem* of her own (balancing two lives both of which she is desperate to keep, and putting off the hard decision needed to choose between them) that makes sense instead of being a fantasy construct for plot purposes.  Running around saving the Doctor's life is a piece of story nonsense, IMO.  Trying to walk two paths that go in different directions is something real people, particularly young people still forming up their goals, is something human that I can relate to, particularly the realization that when you choose one of those paths, you are choosing *against* the other and closing off a branch of your life that -- who knows? -- could have been the more significant and rewarding one. 

She wasn't a companion *better* than her Doctor, but a companion brought suddenly into real focus and a much more interesting and realistic existence *by the nature* of her Doctor -- someone who offered her opportunities and scope for development not to be found elsewhere, but who also presented great challenges in the volatility and alien-ness of his character.

That makes her, to me, a very special case, and a very important one.

The bike I am looking at moving on to is the new Indian Scout 2015, so by waiting a year I will get a better look at the bike (from owners reviews etc.) and I'll know if there are any major reasons why I shouldn't be pining for this bike.

There is also the experience factor. Although I am confident on my CBF, I feel there is way more to learn. I will be planning trips up to Scotland with friends, just for the ride and some camping fun. So I've got some plans to keep me entertained for the year.

I'm not sure about you, but money is another factor to work with. Having another year to save money towards the bike, in my case £10.5k is super important... I'me hoping to have at least half of that with my CBF as p/ex and to finance the rest reasonably.

In the late 1600s the monarchy had very real and wieldable power. They were reinstated (in very basic terms) because the kingdom was fucked without them. Nowadays there'd be no impact beyond the economic.

Honestly? Nobody cares. I don't expect people who don't live here to understand but the apathy towards the royal family here is palpable.

Good on him, I suppose..."" and then they go about their day without giving it a second thought.

&gt;

&gt;__No. 303 (""Kościuszko"") Polish Fighter Squadron__ (*[Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language): *303 Dywizjon Myśliwski ""Warszawski im. Tadeusza Kościuszki"") was one of [16 Polish squadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Air_Forces_in_France_and_Great_Britain) in the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) (RAF) during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). It was the highest scoring of these 16 Polish-manned RAF squadrons during the [Battle of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain).   

&gt;The squadron was named after the [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth) and [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution) hero General [Tadeusz Kościuszko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Kosciuszko), and the eponymous [Polish 7th Air Escadrille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_7th_Air_Escadrille) founded by [Merian C. Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merian_C._Cooper), that served Poland in the 1919–1921 [Polish-Soviet War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War). No. 303 was formed in July 1940 in [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool), [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)  before deployment to [RAF Northolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Northolt) on the 2nd of August as part of an agreement between the [Polish Government in Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Government_in_Exile) and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). It had a distinguished combat record and was disbanded in December 1946.

WRT this case, it seems the exec *was* intimidated to even report it, as it came down to a member of the public exposing it.

**You've got a serious budget problem**. I can tell you that because I'm in a similar position:

* Similar age, two people, no kids
* Household income ~£100k, distributed similarly between two people
* Rent £1650pcm in London
* Commute to work on the train (combined annual cost for two ~£3k)
* Contribute 7/8% to pensions
* Eat out every week (including some very fine dining)
* Pub session once or twice a week
* Three or four holidays a year (one or two long-haul)
* Keep a small car with weekend usage

With all of this we save *at least* £1k a month. We're not hardcore frugal types - we don't take packed lunches to work, we cook with fancy ingredients, iPad, Sky TV etc etc. You need to sit down and go through your expenditure line by line and find the back hole in your budget. You're making lots of money and I can assure you from my own experience that it's enough to live very comfortably and save quite a bit too.

Dude, when the **only** video everyone(non Chelsea fans) has seen of Chelsea fans is that of racist chanting and shoving a black man out of a train, what kind of impression does the people watching get? That viral video was all over the world. 99% of the people watching the video have not ever seen or met any Chelsea fans(london based) in their lives. So what's their **first impression and the only impression of Chelsea fans** would be like? Disgusting, right? Those few people were supposed to represent Chelsea on a world stage and that's how they act?  And on top of that other fan bases suddenly realize/remember that John Terry, their captain who epitomizes Chelsea, was actually taken to a  court and subsequently punished for a racist incident on the pitch? See, those two added up man. The racist incident in Paris was like adding gasoline to a flickering camp-fire which you actually wanted to put out. So what you have to do now is to wait and see the flames go out. Until then you just gotta hope that some stupid fans don't do something pathetic. But yes, until then you have no choice but learn to live with it. I stand by my point. Because it's how the world works whether you like it or not. 

Let me give you another example outside the world of football. The american pit-bull terrier was one of the most popular dogs during the 50s and 60s. They were known for their courage, friendliness and gentleness towards children. It took just a handful of idiots to destroy their reputation and let the whole world believe that they are savages. Why? Because everyone was focused on the fraction of pitbull population vilified by the media. It just took a handful of pitbulls and their owners to tarnish peoples mentality towards the breed. Finally, after decades, people are starting to realize that pitbulls are actually an awesome dog breed if you raise them right. Was the whole saga unreasonable/illogical? Yes, but that's how the world works dude.

I'd recommend the following 4 things:

**Cornish Pasties** - we all love them, but there's a million variations and loads of bad ones. They are also protected by geographical indication by the EU in the same way as parmesan cheese and champagne. Eat them hot or cold but you need the good crimp on the pastry.

[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty#Cornish_pasty)

[How to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPJWBkWqwTE)

**Bedfordshire Clanger** - this is a variation on the pasty. In one half you get the meat, savoury part. In the other you get the fruit, pie part so its like a whole portable meal wrapped in pastry. Same sort of rules for a pasty except this is regional to Bedfordshire and the immediate area and its sadly dying out. Pretty soon it won't be around which is a real shame.

[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire_clanger)

[Recipe](http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/513570)

**Parkin** - this is a dense, sticky treacle based cake that tends to be eaten across the north of england in autumn around bonfire night. There are variations but generally its pretty standard and its always delicious and dark. The more treacle you use and the stickier it is the better

[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkin_(cake)

[James Martin's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLY11TFsVqc)

**Mince Pies** - its not a british christmas without mince pies and they don't appear to have them in US although Canada and Australia seem to have them in some regions. Everyone in britain has them and everyone claims they hate them but everyone eats them like antidote is in them. They vary wildly in quality but homemade are always best, you can make them as spicy and as boozy as you like but the real secret is the pastry is really there only to carry mincemeat, you need to make it as thin and short as possible.
