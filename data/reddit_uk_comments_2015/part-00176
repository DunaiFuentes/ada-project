Evans maintained his innocence and repeatedly accused his neighbor, John Christie, of murdering his wife and daughter. The police investigation and physical evidence used to convict Evans was weak. After Evans’ trial and execution, Christie was found to be a serial killer who was responsible for murdering several women at his residence. There were massive campaigns to overturn Evans’ conviction and an official inquiry was conducted 16 years later. It was confirmed that Evans’ daughter had been killed by Christie, and Evans was granted a posthumous pardon. **This case of injustice had a strong influence in the UK’s decision to abolish capital punishment.**

I would assume he'd choose 20 years in jail rather than death. 

I would be surprised if the death penalty works as a big deterrent - I assume the people it targets, the most heinous of crimes, are not thinking logically.

Their name literally translates to 'National Socialist German Workers' Party'.

The most telling quote here is:
 *Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities, and in the 1930s the party's focus shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes.*

Indeed many of their early policies were all socialist orientated to gain populist support. So, yes they were Socialist in a bastard marriage with fascism.

Our defense is so terrible that his presence in our goal doesn't even become a factor most of the time, unfortunately. There's typically nothing the guy can even do. If we do well with reinvesting that money into defenders and midfielders, it could easily be a net gain in our defensive quality.

'The Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after the Second World War in response to a call issued by Europeans from all walks of life who had gathered at the Hague Congress. Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a ""charter of human rights"" and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention. As a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, he had seen first-hand how international justice could be effectively applied. With his help, the French former minister and Resistance fighter Pierre-Henri Teitgen submitted a report[4] to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights just agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate. After extensive debates,[5] the Assembly sent its final proposal[6] to the Council's Committee of Ministers, which convened a group of experts to draft the Convention itself.'

Edit: If the court is so bad and being misused so often then we just need to reform the ECHR. Simply rewriting the law is ridiculous, although it means that we'd probably be enforcing such convictions in our own courts.

Similarly it may be that in an execution we take our prisoner and we kill him, but he's the wrong man. An innocent wrongly accused.

It's really interesting to see the titles and their respective discounts. Madness.

Other than this, lots of good advice on here. Economic car, with low tax and insurance group. Nothing souped up or crazily modified. Personally I love little zip about cars like Peugeot 107 or Citroen C1 - I think £10 or £20 tax a year compared to my £110. I have an '07 Kia Picanto which gets me from A-B and for a 30 minute commute every day both ways, I can put in £35 petrol in for a month and a half. (but that's just for work, not counting long journeys which I rarely make anyways)

The day and time you search on comparison websites counts in a really weird way too. Depending on whether it's morning/afternoon/late night, it can get you some really good deals. I searched on different days at different times a few days apart and the price changes are quite significant - I understand that the insurance companies change the deals frequently, but not entirely sure what the formula is..

Hope this is of some help!

We can speculate that more people would have voted Green or UKIP knowing that they could choose which of Labour or Conservatives got their vote as a backup plan, and both parties would have got more than one seat each.

We might also speculate that the SNP wouldn't have got many second-choice votes, and that anyone who supported them over the other parties did vote for them. Assuming that Labour would be the second choice for many SNP voters, they would probably have held on to some Scottish seats where the SNP didn't get over 50% of the vote.

I doubt it would have helped the Lib Dems much, or switched any seats between Conservatives and Labour.

It looks like we're courting Wimmer and maybe VVD who are both younger more technical central defenders, neither with Premier League experience. I'd love to have a pair of ball-playing center halves but I think the first quality we need to look for in a partner for Vertonghen or Dier is command.

-Injuries to the spine of the team. They say a good spine (forwards, center mids, center backs, keeper) wins football games . Well, as it happens, most of our injuries this year have been to the forwards and the center backs... severely crippling our spine. We have not had the depth to cope, that much is obvious.

-Expectations too high. We got off to a hot, hot start that was never going to be sustainable. This league is a marathon and we had far too many pieces who approached it like a sprint. Diafra and Enner wore themselves out. We asked Downing to do too much. Bless three-lunged Cheik Kouyate and Mark Noble, who never seem to wear down.

-Kevin Nolan getting healthy. Yeah, that sounds like a joke, but it isn't. It is no coincidence that our form dropped off once he recovered from his shoulder injury. Sam's refusal to drop him despite having several better options really hampered us tactically and has stifled our offensive output. I will say this: Kev usually puts in a great defensive shift, at least.

-Poor player management. This kind of goes with points 1 and 3, but I think one of our biggest problems was a refusal to be flexible with the options we had at our disposal. Playing the same lot the same way every week will not only wear the team out, it will make us predictable to opponents.

-Tactical inflexibility. Once the new year started we got too defensive, too stagnant, too inflexible. We shouldn't play a 4-4-2 every week, because teams will learn how to beat that. But we shouldn't resort to hoof ball every week, either. We needed more creativity in our game plans, and more creativity from our players.

-Poor finishing. A lot of that is due to injuries at the forward position... but I cannot even begin to fathom how poor we've been finishing the ball this season. Part of it is the amount of crosses, I think. Headed goals are a great weapon, but at times we're relying on it as our only weapon and neglecting our feet entirely will only make it harder to score with them when they're called upon.",null,0,null,1431284797,null,0,false,0,cr4q0fk,null,t3_35idkx,null,t1_cr4q0fk,null,t3_35idkx,null,null,null,1432881443,null,4,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,4,null

Libertarianism and liberalism both start from a fundamental belief in individual liberty as the building block of society. Libertarians and liberals therefore share views about things like the importance of civil liberties, human rights and privacy.

Those 'civil' or 'political' ideas tend to be the primary emphasis for liberals though, whereas libertarians generally focus first on matters of 'economic' liberty such as tax cuts and deregulation.

On these economic matters, libertarianism takes what liberals views as an extreme 'paint-by-numbers' approach to the concept of liberty, essentially assuming that all government intervention is bad and that shrinking government is therefore always beneficial for individual liberty.

Liberals, on the other hand, tend to have softer edges with regards to economics and are more willing to countenance measures to help the poor. The German FDP has the slogan ""*as much government as necessary, as little government as possible*"", which is a nice way of putting it - i.e. liberals do see a necessary role for the government, but don't endorse the socialist/social-democratic view that a bigger state is a better state.",null,0,null,1431284953,null,0,false,0,cr4q3ed,null,t3_35hg0s,null,t1_cr4q3ed,null,t1_cr4hbns,null,null,null,1432881482,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

different people have different influences. as an extreme example. united fans would ignore that last title winning season when evaluating giggs as he didnt have much influence on the season. 

I am talking about rodgers here. not liverpool football club.

so when people look to judge rodgers and they state last year, i feel it shouldn't be considered as a credit to rodgers but as a credit to suarez and how much he meant. 

the reason i ignore last year concerning rodgers is because he benefited from suarez and not the other way around.

he had a player (who he didnt buy) come in to the form of his life and become one of the top 5 players in the world. maybe even number 3.  

rodgers has been with us for 3 years and when he came we were far from the top 4 and had a pretty weak squad.

fast forward three years and we are again far from the top 4 and have a weak squad. things havnt improved enough in three years.


Im not mystic meg and i cant see in the future. no one can. but that doesnt mean that is not logical to assume that united and city are going to improve. they have the resources to do so in a single summer. anyone who thinks its likely that united will remain as erratic as they have been is just kidding themselves. Van Gaal is a goodmanager and is just finishing his first season. he improved united a lot in one season and has yet to really stamp his influence on the squad. arsenal might not improve but they are a much better side already.

chelsea are going nowhere and city are far ahead of us and who knows what they will add next year.

This season has been about getting into the top four, minimising the impact of so many new signings, giving them the time to develop, and then targeting the cup competitions."" - BR in January

""We weren’t expected to get into the top four...We sit in fifth place, having reached two cup semi-finals, which is probably on par with where we are at."" - BR a week ago or so

I hardly see how you can call people fickle- the manager set the tone we were going to challenge for the title, then we were going to challenge for top 4, then it was never expected we'd be in top 4.  That's fickle- changing opinion and statements frequently I believe being pretty close to the definition.

We didn't need to bring in nearly as much depth as we did and BR also said we needed players who could come straight into the first 11 last summer.  How many did we buy who can do that?  I'd say none except maybe Moreno but even he has been left out in deference to a RB who is leaving in the summer.

For now I think the Draft Communications Data Bill is more focused on the whole 'snooping on meta data' bit rather than an attack on encryption because as you mentioned that is far more controversial and ill-thought out. I would imagine the two being pressed separately simply to avoid the long desired snooping elements being put at risk by ill-understood technical concerns over encryption. They can paint opponents of the snooping as being soft on terrorism but the issues of weakening legitimate encryption would face more of a backlash from the tech sector &amp; the business lobby.

The issue is that there's so much space BETWEEN our lines. Our defensive line isn't shoving up as high as they did under AVB, and our midfield is pushing up higher than they did under AVB. Our central defenders don't have a lot of protection, and in those situations they are more prone to losing composure and organization.

There's a nervousness and a disorganization throughout our entire side currently. It's not an issue that can be fixed by buying one leadership figure to put in central defense.

What? He's been performing poorly and that's that. I don't give a fuck about the time it takes to adjust, I expect a 30 mil player to be able to complete a 2 yard fucking pass. Against Burnley he was a fucking handicap. Every attack we had just died through him, he was a black hole. Against Tottenham when he came on he managed to give the ball away 3 times despite how little he played. That's barely a scratch in the surface of the negative things he's amazingly been able to do since he's signed for us. 

I don't expect him to come out and score goals and bag assists, I wouldn't even mind if he goes invisible, but ffs when he's giving the ball away to the opposition almost *every single time* the ball comes to him consistently in almost every game he appears in and fucks up simple things that a 30 million player shouldn't be doing, then its completely fair to say he's been performing poorly. In fact he hasn't been performing badly, he's been terrible, and it's not exaggeration.

Likewise plenty of people are angry over high energy bills, the major energy companies act like a cartel and fix prices together regardless of costs. The '1 year freeze' managed to combine the bad qualities of being half-hearted and inflexible. There are a number of ways to tackle the problem. Outright nationalisation is one, and while it certainly would solve the issue it might be a bit heavy-handed. Tighter regulation on the energy companies may solve the problem more subtly. Or the introduction of a state-run energy company into the market which would set prices at an appropriate level and undercut the private companies when they set their prices an totally unnecessary astronomical levels. Any of these could work, really. 

Framing investment in renewable energy within the terms of reducing UK dependency on foreign oil would be a wise move I think, maybe even pointing to the distant future - making the case for Britain being saved from savage wars over dwindling resources.

It is wrong that the Conservatives have formed a government with the endorsement of only 37% of the electorate. Really what they should have is 37% of the seats in the house of commons, because that would be fair and democratic. That fact remains regardless of how much or little I want a Tory government. 

Under PR I presume we would be getting some kind of coalition agreement involving the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and UKIP. Whilst this is something I would perhaps consider worse than a majority Tory government it is at the very least a fair and democratic representation which **would have the endorsement of the majority of the electorate**; something that is lacking in the current government. The 37% now get their favourite policies pushed through with no compromise, and it is not on. 

I voted green, but I don't whinge about PR because FPTP currently offers no representation to anybody left of Labour, I whinge about it because it is a fundamentally stupid system to base a modern democracy on. I'm incredibly happy that the SNP have swept Labour aside in Scotland and won 50 seats, but it is grossly unfair that so many more voted for UKIP and have no representation. I would much rather people didn't vote UKIP, but to deny people representation is undemocratic. Our culture supposedly places a lot of stock in the democratic process, we sent men in their millions to die in the name of it and members of my own family grew up on the other side of the Iron Curtain without the freedom to vote. Democracy is a principle I very much believe in, my opposition to FPTP has not merely arisen due to the recent Conservative government. And given the likely demographics of this subreddit, I doubt it is something the majority of us have have recently u-turned on. 

And to be honest, even if you do think it smells of hypocrisy, it doesn't make the argument any less legitimate. The only people arguing for FPTP are either disingenuous bastards with vested interests (for example, most Labour and Conservative MPs) or people too ill-aware to understand its flaws. It is an abysmal system of electing governments and it is frankly an embarrassment that there is little desire to change it.

If that's the decision we need to make, then we need to decide some things about which one we're most comfortable with:

1) how many sacrifices are we willing to make whilst saving if we go down that route? As it stands, we have lost at least 60 citizens to the welfare cuts. Potentially many more. At what point would people who feel we need to save, dish out their savings to start saving lives? (think about if it was your gran and you ran out of money - would you borrow to save her? or what about your son)

2) if we borrow, is that harmful to the economy in the long run in such a way that we would ALL suffer, for the sake of a few?

This is really the crux of it, no?

If you're emailing them, you could get their email off their website, but you can also send it via [writetothem.com](https://www.writetothem.com).

Scotland, Wales and London use a slightly worse version of MMP which isn't fully party list, it uses constituencies then tops them up with a closed party list. This system ""additional member"" would be fine across the UK as it's roughly proportional.

What I meant was that the UK wouldn't abandon local representation which is what moving to a full UK wide party list system would do, and is what everyone's calculating when they draw up graphs of how many seats each party would get using PR. I believe if the UK does move to PR, we'd only roughly have it whilst keeping local representation which STV would do nicely as would additional member. Both of this would still give a slight boost to regional parties as STV would still have constituencies and additional member doesn't have top-up or overhang seats as MMP does. Because of all this, I wanted to have a look at what STV, which is probably the most likely candidate to be used (if any, ever) would actually give us. Of course I'd far prefer a semi-proportional system to the one we have at the moment, and STV remains my favourite voting system for our country (specifically Schulze-STV, but I don't think we're likely to get that).

I could, however, see a full UK party list D'Hondt or Sainte-Lague system for a ""senate"" that both Labour and LDs want to introduce, although reforming the Lords isn't at the top of my priority list tbh.

Under FFA yes, under full independence? They can use it but you're not getting control over it. Why should the UK secede control of their currency to an independent state who wishes to work against them?

Tips for cheaper insurance - go for a higher excess but I would recommend making sure you have that amount in addition to your standard emergency fund just in case you need it. 

When it comes to insurance don't always focus on lowest cost - it can end up costing you more in the long run! And, if you do need the cover, you are going to wish you shelled out the extra money.

&gt; once government spending rises above about 25 per cent of GDP, for each additional percentage point of GDP the government spends, growth is around 0.1-0.15 per cent lower per year

There's a good explanation for that, and you're partially right, they're linked. Government spending is reduced to give lower taxes and raised in rough combination with raising taxes. But wait, not all taxes are equal. A progressive tax system is correlated with bigger growth than regressive (rich pay less as a proportion of their income).

What's happening now is that the vulnerable are being squeezed to fund lower tax for the rich and very rich. The very rich are usually growth engines but in this recession they're not, mainly wanting to invest in safe havens such as gold rather than investing in shares, growth and traditional job based recovery (the jobs gained since the recover have been almost exclusively self employed, lower wage and lower end jobs). This is part of why the trickle down effect is bullshit. 

Inequality is rising, fast. Wage growth for the 90% lowest paid is stagnant. If you're rich, you're ok, but that's always been true throughout history. Growth is mostly better when driven by consumption across the board rather than luxuries.

You're under the assumption that a UK internal fishing rights barrier will auto determine official maritime borders between two different states in the event of independence, it's simply not true.

There is no such thing as an ""internal fishing rights barrier"". The UK's EEZ is divided into three zones, each of which is governed by the English, Scottish, or NI legal system.

Do those boundaries correspond to the boundaries of a sovereign state? Of course not, no more than the land border between Scotland and England does.

Are those boundaries going to be the starting point for any divisions of assets under FFA (or independence)? I think they probably would be. It certainly seems a more sensible starting point than saying that Scotland should be able to lay claim to assets that are geographically within England (or vice versa)

&gt; Under FFA yes, under full independence? They can use it but you're not getting control over it. Why should the UK secede control of their currency to an independent state who wishes to work against them?

Independence is not going to happen in the near future. When it does happen I suspect the reasoning will be that the UK is not in fact going to be ""seceding control"", and I would presume that most politicians are capable of realising that Scotland is not becoming independent to ""work against"" rUK.

I've already said it, but I'll say it again - I don't downvote people I disagree with, and I don't agree with people who do.

What other people do is entirely up to them.

&gt; Coming from an SNP supporter who's whole campaign and argument is based on anger and resentment, why is it that SNP supporters and Nationalists are regularly called out on here for being the most hostile and unfriendly people to talk to, even by your own? Something to think about perhaps? The fact of the matter is that it is impossible to have any discussion with you SNP supporters without you simply jumping on the opponent and attempting to silence them with downvotes. You're hypocrites, plain and simple really.

I disagree with your premise that people arguing for independence (which is more than just SNP supporters) are doing so ""from anger and resentment"". The independence campaign was and is about creating a positive future for Scotland, not about trying to damage England.

I don't see many established players transferring to Liverpool the same way that younger players want to. I fully believe that we need a striker and need to sell Sturridge. I say this because with Sturridge's injuries, he is not going to be the same player he once was and his bloated wages far outweigh that of his marginal benefit. We ignored the striker position for so long because we had Suarez, but now its time that FSG look to put the pressure on that area. 

We have enough valuable wingers and attacking players in Markovic, Ibe, Sterling, Lallana, and Coutinho that this area is not one of concern. They are young (Lallana being our most experienced at 27) and hungry. I think more development and time is needed with them. 

We have a solid midfield in Henderson, Lucas, Can, and Allen. These guys and their rotation is important in creating a healthy system to stabilize the club and challenge for a higher place. 

Finally, I think that with Moreno, Manquillo, Lovren, Skrtel, Sakho, Can, and then Wisdom coming back, we have a great defensive line. What we need is the strikers. We have youth that is only going to get better with time, but we need a striker to actually finish the piece of art that is Liverpool. 

Going after young players like Vietto and Ings is important. We won't attract top talents, so we have to make our own. We made Suarez into the best striker in the world (arguably) and we can do it again with the squad that we currently have. Hendo has transformed into England's starting central midfielder, Sterling is a Golden Ball winner, and Can is looking like he could break into the German side in a few years.

If you liked the vitamin e cleanser you might like the simply radiant cloth cleanser from the superdrug own line, they seem to be pretty similar. 

As for the simple cleanser I had the same thought as you and bought it hoping it would be a good backup. I found it fine, not a miracle product but didn't irritate any eczema patches or make my oily skin too oily. Its the consistency of a lotion so it's not thick like the vitamin e one but it spreads easily though you might use more of it, but since its inexpensive and always in sale somewhere shouldn't be a problem. It did a good job of removing my makeup and even waterproof mascara with no irritation. When I toned after I didn't see anything on the cotton pad.

I currently live in one of the safest Tory constituencies in the country. 

I joined because I actually think that they would make the best governing party, and we'd probably be a better country for it. It will probably never happen, but I also don't think it's silly to stand up and say you'd like to see it happen. Also, I am very left socially, but I am more centrist (although slightly left) fiscally. I think pragmatism and fairness are a good way to approach policies.

I think the Lib Dems didn't deserve the defeats they've been given since joining the coalition. I am a student, and while I'd love to have free university, I think that the way the current loans are set up are much fairer than what my husband's Labour era student loans are. 

I felt like I shouldn't moan about manifestos not appealing to me without being more involved in the process. I have a feeling Labour is going to lurch even further rightwards, and I'd rather not be involved in that. The Greens are too kooky for me.

brendan is the manager and the manager has to account for such things. we had one striker get injured. just one. why dont we have anyone else to replace him?

why are the rest of our strikers shit or misused? thats brendans fault.

he might not have chosen balotelli but he chose a lot of new transfers. he should have got a striker. sturridge has been injury prone his entire career so you cant call it bad luck. he should have known better.

20 million on lovren in inexcusable when we go without upfront. it seems harsh to make say these things after the fact but that is the only time you can judge a manager.

the reason they get paid is because it is up to them to make the right choices at the start of the season or at the start of a game.


the reasons we struggled this year could have been avoided by, simply put, ""a better manager"".

i could be wrong. i understand that. but if i ask myself to be honest and guess where we will be in a year with rodgers, i dont think it will be top four again. we have no appeal to established European talent right now and we need it because next season is shaping up to be a tougher season.

Pros, the wages are pretty good here, i get more money than i would for the same job in the UK.

The people are pretty friendly once you get to the know them. It's also quite a pretty place, lots of old towns next to lakes and forests and stuff. 

Cons, Swedish food is pretty bland, unless you like herring and potatoes. The beer is fucking expensive in the bars, otherwise you can only buy it from the state owned off-license. There are russian submarines patrolling the stockholm archipelago :( .

The weater, summer is warmer than the UK, winter is much colder. Also it's dark, so very dark. Apart from in the summer when you can wake up at 3am and it's bright sunlight outside.

null,false,demon4372,null,null,null,"&gt;I am led to understand this ideology is essentially a conservative one. A belief in free-markets, some regulation but really approaching a liberal touch to overseeing businesses and so on.

I disagreeing with your premise, it is not a ""conservative"" ideology. It is a *liberal* ideology, the point is, it is the conservative party that adopted a essentially liberal free market platform under thatcher, she was after all a radical economic liberal. Now by no means do i think we should go this Neo-Classical Liberal, but the point still stands. 

&gt;What is the alternative in the Liberal Democrats? I don't want to see the party shift onto Labour territory with price regulations, heavy regulation, unions abusing their power (but I do think unions have a place in society) and so on.

From my understanding it is more a ""Social Liberal/Social Democrat"" side of things, being center-left. I think there is a quote somewhere of Tony Blair saying we used to be left of New Labour back when we used to be like that. 

&gt;Am I right in thinking that Orange Book LibDems believe in an almost Conservative economic policy combined with liberal social policies?

My understanding is, its about Political, Economic and Social Liberalism. I personally like to think of it, almost returning to the Whig routs of the party. Its about liberal solutions to modern problems. 

&gt;In which case why is Labour viewed as the natural friend of the Liberal Democrats? In many respects they're not.

I think its because of a lot of historical opposition to the tories, and the fact we have at times been left of centre. Someone showed me a manifesto from the 70's, and it looked like something taken out of the communist manifesto compared to today.

****

Something i would point out, is that although we (should at least) be Economically Liberal overall, it is the Social Liberalism that is also part of the party means that we are far more compassionate and less heartless than the tories are.

Yes, it was through a big company (Europcar) and the letter was definitely from them. The main letter was just a cover letter (with their branding on it) with about 30 other pages of pictures of the damage to the car I was driving along with estimated repair costs and the v5 and their scrapping receipt. It was very detailed.

I have now fully read the contract, and they do have a clause saying:
""7.2.2 Neither our cover nor any of our Excess Reduction Products protects you for loss or damage to the vehicle and/or Accessories caused by driver abuse, negligence or breach of this Agreement. In these circumstances you must pay all of our losses and damages and you agree to pay all relevant Charges and a Damage Administration Fee for each incident""

Have you heard anything like this in your line of work before?

I have been to the CAB now and have received some advice. The first thing they gave me is a telephone number for some trading standards experts to ask them for further advice. They said once I have spoken with them I will need to write a formal letter to Europcar challenging the claim. They also gave me a list of local solicitors who can provide a 30 minute free consultation for this sort of thing.

As an aside, my father-in-law thinks I should be seeking to make a claim against them as I was injured in the accident, and only the passenger side air bags went off but not the driver ones. Do you think this is something I should pursue? I wouldn't normally think about it, but it could be a good counter tactic (to make them drop the case) and I may just need to the money to give back to them if I have to pay this bill.",null,0,null,1431292067,null,0,false,0,cr4tttf,null,t3_357af4,null,t1_cr4tttf,null,t1_cr3g719,null,null,null,1432883241,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

Labour should have done better at this election, and failure to do so is at nobody's feet but ours. The fact that Blair screwed the pooch so totally on electoral reform is a fact we've all got to live with. But I'm certainly not going to apologise for that; I was not a member of the party during the New Labour years for that reason and others. 

But during the Miliband years, there was proper electoral reform on the agenda. Miliband even backed the shower that was the AV referendum (although many backbenches didn't), and failure to back that appalling half-assed excuse for a Lords Reform is totally justified.

But that in no way let's the Lib Dems off the hook for getting behind Cameron and enabling his narrative to take hold for five years as the economy grinds slowly back to life. Was it worth it? For no reform, for a few nice little tweaks to the tax scheme? To be able to say ""we prevented them from being as awful as they might have been""? I think the electorate has made its view on that quite clear, and I couldn't agree with them more.

In other words, Human Rights trump everything else -- a concept which many might think is right and proper.

So at the moment if someone is convicted of a crime then they can seek a judicial review to have that ruling overturned as long as they can show that either in the process of being tried and convicted, or the sentence itself, would cause some breach of the HRA.

In part it comes because the role is different from that of most ministers - the LC has additional constitutional duties, acts as a sort of liaison with the judiciary, and has some weird legal powers.

Grayling has shown that he doesn't understand some pretty fundamental areas of law - such as how human rights law works (although that may have been deliberate), or even his own role - as noted in the article above. In his attempts to restrict access to justice he's lost several major judicial reviews - with one judge finding he acted in a way that ""no reasonable Lord Chancellor"" would (although that is more of a legal test than anything else). No wonder he has fought so hard to restrict judicial review. He even [had to admit to misleading Parliament](http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/grayling-admits-misleading-parliament/5045575.fullarticle) over his attempts to limit judicial review. And also managed to get the Criminal Bar Association to go on strike... twice.

It isn't so much that he has had no legal training (although then he might be able to understand why he keeps breaking the law, or be able to talk about things like human rights without lying), but demonstrated that he doesn't care for principles behind the rule of law, such as fairness, equality, access to justice, and ministers acting lawfully.

But I guess that's part of what comes from putting someone who's main function was as a Conservative ""attack dog"" in a role that requires a degree of... I think the word used in that first article was ""gravitas"" - but perhaps ""seriousness"" or ""calmness"" might be better words.

Many think that is a good thing. Some Tories think it's a bad thing and it would be better to force people to go straight to Strasbourg.

The Tory leadership does not want to end our involvement in the ECHR altogether (although some Tories do). The ECHR was set up by British lawyers after WW2 and is part of the Council of Europe - an institution larger than the EU which includes Russia. People often mix up the ECHR and the EU. They are separate institutions. However, the Lisbon Treaty states that membership of the ECHR is a requirement for membership of the EU, so if we left the ECHR (and therefore the Council of Europe) we would also have to leave the EU (unless some concession was made).

To answer your question directly, they want to replace it with a US-style Bill of Rights.

Internationalism - the Lib Dems put a big emphasis on the importance of the international 'clubs' Britain is part of, such as the EU and the UN. Labour tend to support these when it suits them but also ignore them when it doesn't, such as the Iraq War. The Lib Dems are also relatively relaxed about immigration, whereas Ed Miliband put a big emphasis during his leadership on how Labour has changed its mind on immigration and now wants to reduce it significantly.

Political reform - the Lib Dems led the 'yes' campaign in the AV referendum, which was opposed by a large number of Labour MPs, most Labour voters and the trade unions who fund Labour.

I'm 26, so this election was my second general election. I've voted Lib Dem both times. Admittedly my faith was tested with the whole student loan thing, what really offended me about the whole thing was how the unbreakable promise was broken, or at least was seen to be broken, I personally think that's what offended people the most, rather than the policy change. 

I also am someone who quite liked some of Eds campaign over at labour. Especially getting rid of non dom status, and raising the minimum wage. 

However, I think I am a lib dem at heart. I place large value on things like Civil Liberties and Net Neutrality, which the other parties don't seem to care too much about. I believe that the state is there to help people who need it, with the NHS and the Welfare State (but work should always be the end goal and 'pay'), but that Government shouldn't intrude on people's lives; people should be able to do what they want, as long as it doesn't hurt anybody, and shouldn't be worried they're being spied on. 

I don't believe that people should be demonised for doing well, but that they should contribute to help people who aren't doing quite so well. 

Oh, and electoral reform is a must. 

So yeah basically I've had a long think about this over the past few days, because I was concerned that I'd join and find out the lib dems were the wrong party for me, but I think my views align with the party (am I right?) and what got me to join was obviously the hammering you guys got the other day.

null,false,FacialLaFleur,null,null,null,"Just as an aside to the discussion, I voted for Ann McKechin (Labour) for my constituency - Glasgow North. She was my MP from 2001 to 2005. She entered the voting at -2.4% to the SNP's Patrick Grady but she lost by 25% - over 10 times what she was quoted to be behind - while Grady took 53% of all votes. The Conservatives took 8% narrowly beating the Green's 6%, despite the fact I live in a well-off area. To give specifics, my house and most neighbouring houses are valued at over 7 figures. It's also in the heart of the west end, situated in the middle of three private schools. In short, Conservative policy largely benefits my area. 
As a result, this was very, very difficult for me to take. Part of why I voted Labour was because I disagree fundamentally with the Tories' decisions to cut spending for the elderly and disabled, and also because I think Labour's policies bring about better results for the whole of society instead of just one small class. 
The largest reason was McKechin herself. In 2011, I emailed her asking questions for a dissertation on the progression of Labour. She emailed back, within the hour, asking if instead I wanted to meet and asked about the specifics of my work. We met, I gave her my set of questions and she then produced a series of email contacts to other MPs and Lords, while giving me a list of recommended reading on the matter she'd found. We continued talking and I ended up spending a few days with her on work experience over the summer; she ended up giving a recommendation for the job I currently have. She was, in my eyes, someone who truly valued the position she held and someone who had duly earned their right to represent their constituency. 
This election has been seismic in more ways than one and I think the divide between North and South is becoming irreversible. As a Scot, I understand a lot of the issues English/Welsh/Irish would of had voting Labour (for fear of an SNP-Labour Coalition). What I would caution you all is this: do not trust the SNP. They have, in certain respects, been a political change brought about by growing senses of nationalism and entitlement. Their white paper on Independence has been duly ridiculed, labelled as both factually inaccurate (by Kevin Hague) and ""wrong in law"" (Adam Tomkins - Professor of Public Law @ Glasgow Uni).
The point I'm trying to make is this: I've seen a lot of discussion about how people fear the prospect of this Tory government. I'm growing more fearful of the SNP lead Scottish one. What people will have you believe is that Scotland has become progressively lefter, and to a certain extent that is true, but that is not the growing cause of this revolution. People do not trust Labour anymore, but that has resulted in near blind faith in the SNP. People are leading with their hearts over their heads and it's really scary to see.

On top of that, it runs the risk of making it easier for the government to silence people it doesn't agree with. I'm not suggesting that we're going to be launched into some fanatical police-state but for instance, it's fairly easy for the government to pass stricter regulations on the right to protest. Subtle changes in those regulations could make it easier for people protesting to get prison sentences, which in turn could help silence those voices.

when she tweeted “white people love playing divide and rule”, she was referring specifically to colonialism and the white establishment.

now i think that the reason a lot of people are so venomously anti-Diane Abbott is because they found her invoking white Britain's colonial heritage inflammatory, unnecessary but most of all, uncomfortable. 

but i personally understand why a black londoner, second generation Jamaican immigrant would hold those views about the white establishment. especially when discussing ethnic minority political groups. black people do still have a great deal of progress to make in this country.

so in context, i wasn't really offended by what she said, i thought it was fairly clear she was referring to the white establishment, the tweet was just lazy and perhaps a little angry. i can forgive her saying slightly derogatory things about white people.

does that explain why I don't think she is a racist?",null,0,null,1431295984,null,0,false,0,cr4vym4,null,t3_35is4c,null,t1_cr4vym4,null,t1_cr4vi9c,null,null,null,1432884246,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

 &gt; Rodgers isn't like that, he wants fullbacks to be intelligent, like a midfielder but with the athleticism to cope with the physical demands. Rodgers wants his player to attack WITH the ball.

That description is for Manquillo a lot more than it's for Flanagan. All you've done is refer back to Cissokho and Johnson, who I have barely mentioned. You've compared Manquillo to everyone except Flanagan. Also you said earlier the 3 at the back suits Rodgers more so he can play his desired style of full back...that's complete bullshit. Rodgers played 3 at the back so he could put more bodies back to cover up the fact that it's been 3 years and we haven't gotten any better at defending. We've not looked any better and have only produced more clean sheets because we simply have more players back. That's led to having less players forward and guess what...less goals.

Here stop with the Can stuff, he's a midfielder. He's moved to defence out of necessity and he won't be staying there. He looks comfortable on the ball but he's not a great defender by any means. I don't care what Kolo or Rodgers say, are they gonna come out and say he was a shite defender? Absolutely not.

You also manipulated that quote very well and left out the part where Rodgers said:

&gt; But he’s a player that if you asked him his profile it would be to sit and play in that defensive role where he can play and dictate the game and be physical in the duel.

Edit:  

At work and time to type an essay, wooo!  

Honestly, I can't wait for the season to be over at this stage and us to just know whether we can get Europe or not. Our performances are so dire that the hope preceding each game is decidedly lessening every week no matter who we play, and post-game there is nothing to be hopeful about at all after the sorry excuse for performances put in by players and the team as a whole.    

One thing that is especially galling at present is that despite everything we had going for us throughout the whole season, we are now losing games left right and centre, and a big part of it is our defense just not being up to standard. The two goals against Leicester were atrocious defending (plus a nice finish I'll grant). Stick a fucking foot in when Mahrez is running across you; seriously how hard is it? I almost preferred not being able to score then losing to a wonder goal; the defensive errors we've been making in the last few weeks (Tottenham, Sunderland, Leicester) are absolutely ridiculous and they are one of the most irritating things because before at least we had defending down to near-on an art form, organised, solid, good decisions made, great communication and understanding. Now watch the 2nd Leicester goal and tell me how that's any different from the idiot I play 5-a-side with charging in to help me tackle a guy in the corner and leaving the middle totally open.   

The other thing is that there have been things we have all been able to see for a long time that just don't appear to be addressed - or if they are then the players just aren't listening and/or don't care enough. And that caring, or as Koeman rightfully put it ""belief"", is what we're lacking at the moment and makes it so hard to watch as fans who care far too much about the club. Steve Davis hasn't been up to scratch properly linking the midfield and attack for months, he was doing OK but not great for a long time, but last month or so he's been terrible. Pelle doesn't seem to have the running or movement he did at the start, or the understanding with midfielders. Tadic was looking below par for a long time, all sorts of misplaced passes, crosses, shots (either poor shots or good chances wasted by not shooting when he should). Ward-Prowse is still not fitting in properly to any one position. Djuricic has actually looked like he could be the answer whe he's played, but injury etc has meant we can't see for sure. And through it all we just look to lack creativity, understanding, desire or talent in the final third. It is so frustrating, but made worse by now being unable to defend also, because we're just throwing games as if we wanted to only improve our top flight points tally by 1.

From a comment I made elsewhere earlier

&gt;  In particular they want to remove the ""right to family life"" as grounds for appeal.

&gt; Fun fact, in [2013 50,000 immigrants were deported](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/deportations-removals-and-voluntary-departures-uk)

&gt; In the same period, there were [2329 appeals, 602 of which were granted.  Half of these were due to article 8, right to family life](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271659/28027_-__Foreign_criminals_successfully_appealed_against_deportation_16-01-2014.pdf)

&gt;I see that argument from the Conservatives that the need more powers to kick people our as a crock of shit.  They have all the power the need, they're just looking for excused to scrap the HRA.

&gt; Those appeals will have gone through our courts, so it's our courts making the decisions.

&gt; If anything does go to ECHR, then we still don't *have* to do anything, just take their decision under advisement.  True it's generally good practise that we act in the way ECHR rules, but it's also generally true that ECHR rules the same as our own courts do.

&gt; &gt; This is why the HRA was created in the first place - to make it easier for people to lodge challenges to human rights abuses; and why the Conservatives want to abolish it.

&gt; This is very true.  It's worth people remembering that prior to the 1998 HRA, it could take years, and very large sums of money to get to Strasbourg, as they were seeing steady increases in the cases brought to them.  That's why it the HRA was created, to bring the rights home, make it easier, quicker and cheaper for people to get a ruling whilst at the same time allowing our courts to make decisions.

And the [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/35fojj/michael_gove_will_be_in_charge_of_replacing_the/cr4hh3h) I got to that

&gt; Just looking at your numbers, so appeals were about 5% of deportation orders, successful appeals 0.12% and successful appeals on ""right to family life"" grounds about 0.06%.

&gt; So it didn't obstruct the other 99.94% of deportations.

and [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/35hkyp/conservatives_to_push_forward_on_manifesto_and/cr4otob)

&gt; Of course they do.  They're currently denying my children the right to see their mother - no chance of a settlement visa because I don't meet their ridiculously excessive new financial criteria, turned down for a family visit visa because they have started aggressively denying them for spurious reasons and have changed the law so you can't appeal (saying people should waste more money making new applications which are then routinely turned down after the first refusal).

* Front tyre - check tread/general condition. Check around the valve near the hub as often the rubber here starts to perish and will need replacing.

* Front brake disc - is it warped? (happens from age/accidents/heat). To test, when bike is on stand lean bike onto side stand and back so the front wheel is off the ground then spin - you'll know pretty quick if it's warped as it will stop the wheel or slow it and you can hear it sliding.

* Front brakes - pretty self explanatory, check fluid level too on fluid reservoir on right handlebar.

* Headlight/indicators - one headlight should be on when the ignition is on, switching to highbeam turns the first headlight out and the second one on.

* Front forks - check for obvious damage, also check for oil leaks around rubber seals.

* Steering bearing - with front wheel off ground as before, turn steering fully left and right. If the bearing is starting to wear it will 'notch' or feel like it is catching (often in the central position). This will only get worse with age and will need to be replaced.

* Ignition/steering lock - Check steering lock works, there's a tendancy for older cbrs to have a steering lock which is difficult to lock/unlock due to wear in the fairly cheap ignition.

* Exhaust header pipes - older (possibly the new ones too) CBR125s have (for reasoning beyond me) steel exhaust header pipes which have an almost certainty of rusting through at some stage of their life. Check how rusted the exhaust pipe is as it comes out of engine block, if you're unsure you can see if it sounds strange when the engine is started or with the engine running, cover the exit of the exhaust - the engine should start to die rapidly and won't change note much if the pipes are still fully intact.

* Chain and rear sprocket - check condition of chain, does it look well looked after? Check if the rear sprocket is worn at all - look for pictures online of worn sprockets to see what you should be looking for - it starts as an asymmetrical wear. Also check chain tension by pushing the lower chain up by the swingarm and comparing to whats written there (from memory think it's about 5cm??).

Finally, check the following tell-tale signs of it having been dropped - forward fairing scuffs, indicators loose, handlebar ends scraped, bent/scuffed brake and clutch levers, footpeg/brake lever/gear shifter scrapes/bends, any marks on engine cover.

Ask the seller how often they oil the chain/check engine oil.

There is probably more, i'll add if I remember anything else.

 [**Flynn effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%20effect): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Flynn effect__ is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When [intelligence quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) (IQ) tests are initially [standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score#Standardizing_in_mathematical_statistics) using a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics\)) of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.

If you do (in fact regardless) make doubly sure you're aware of your excesses. I got screwed by MCE as theft was an extra £500 excess on top of the original £350.

First, i'd say always make sure the 125s are theft-covered. They are a really REALLY popular choice for thieves as I was told numerous times and finally found out first hand. So if you go third party, go TPFT.

Whether you go TPFT or fully comp will depend really on whether there's a significant difference in price between the two, and how much the bike is worth.

The way I see it is you'll probably have a timeline in your mind of how long you'll own the bike, some idea of how much you'll use it and in what area. Consider worst case scenarios in both situation (TPFT vs Fully comp) and work out whether you'd be totally fucked if you trashed the bike one month in on TPFT, in comparison to how much money you'll save from avoiding fully comp cover.

I would generally advise new riders to go fully comp, but there are other issues to consider - a claim on insurance under fully comp cover for theft or solo accidents will raise your premium, because insurance companies are fuckers.

Cost will largely depend on where you keep the bike and what age you are. Out of cities is SO much cheaper, and having a locked garage makes a massive difference too.

null,false,CaptainHayashi,,Labour Member,null,"I joined the party (at 18 in 2010, so I'm now also 23!) because, while on the surface my politics is closer to the Greens and Socialist parties,  I felt as if Labour was the biggest and most fruitful voice for progressive politics.  Also, in 2010 (and again now), the wilderness of just losing an election was the perfect time for it to move away from New Labour and towards the left.  In that sense, it sorta did and sorta didn't with Ed, but I'm happy with the ground gained and still a member five years on.

Labour is a 'broad church' party, in that it attracts a wide range of opinions and tendencies.  As well as being the party of Blair, Brown and Mandelson, we are also the party of Benn, Skinner and Foot.  (Something I found interesting was a 2003 [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3059773.stm) by the latter on why, after the party moved from the 1983 peak of left-wing Labour to Blairism, he still felt the left should stay in Labour.)

I think now is one of the best times to join, because there is a debate to be had, lots of opinions to fly (do we move back to the centre?  do we keep moving to the left?  do we do so slowly or quickly?  or do we move towards something like Blue Labour, or find a fourth or even fifth way to go?), and most importantly a leadership contest.  I joined in May 2010, and by September I was able to vote (for Ed Miliband!) in a very close and invigorating contest--this year's will be even better because it'll be one member one vote.

Other people will bring their opinions in on this, but what I would say is that Labour is much more than just Chuka Umunna.  It's a broad movement where voices like yours are welcomed.  And I sincerely doubt it's ever too late to join.

You decide which of the 2 main parties you'd like to win, Labour or Tories (or which one you'd like to stop winning, and pick the opposite), then you go into the voting booth and put an X next to that party's logo.

Honestly you could have a chimpanzee with a Labour badge and in a fairly safe Labour area like Bradford West they'll still get the vote.

&gt;My final question centres around the FPTP system, and how far it can be pushed. I theorised a hypothetical situation where a party manages to get an overall majority, but does so by getting the lowest possible share of the votes. This is completely hypothetical and is, in practice, extremely unlikely. As a result, I needed to make a number of assumptions to simplify the task;

&gt;The winning party only fields candidates in the 326 constituencies with the lowest populations, thereby ensuring they gain the lowest number of votes possible.

&gt;The winning party in each constituency receives 1 more vote than the party in second place, who receives 1 more vote than the party in third place and so on. This allows for the minimum number of votes while maintaining relatively similar opposition from each party.

&gt;Five parties dominate UK politics (I used Labour, Conservatives, Lib Dems, the Greens and UKIP), with the SNP adding to those five only in Scottish constituencies.

&gt;The turnout at local elections is the same as the turnout at a national level.

&gt;I based the turnout on GE2015 (61%), and used the electorate sizes from GE2010[20] (based on a gov't report).

&gt;I found that the winning party need only attain 2.53 million votes from the smallest 326 constituencies. This equates to around 9.1% of the votes at a national level. Although this is extremely unlikely, the fact that this figure is so low demonstrates the flaws of the FPTP system. Tactical campaigning may, one day, see a similar situation arise.

Did you read the article?

""Mr Gove has not appeared to repeat any such backing for the death penalty since he made the remarks in 1998""

&gt;where the individual given the job appears to have particular opinions that don't necessarily tally with the role.

*Had*. Not 'have'. The latter is cause for the supposed concern, but the former makes the publishing of it a bit agenda-tastic - he was a journalist writing to sell newspapers when he wrote this on the back of a hot topic at the time, not an MP representing anyone (that was seven years later). In the case of Morgan, it's a bit different because (as I said) it becomes a question of which is more legitimate - voting for what your constituents want, or ignoring them and voting for what you believe?

We don't consider every MP before 1967 as evil simply because it wasn't until then that homosexuality stopped being a prosecutable offence; Roy Jenkins (the then Home Secretary) even said in Parliament during the debate """"those who suffer from this disability carry a great weight of shame all their lives"". Now, we can either consider that a watermark of how people generally felt/ what was considered socially acceptable at the time, or we can say he was an evil bigot and so were they all - but the latter is the kind of thing that happens when judged by today's standards (which IMO is taking things out of context a bit); I kind of consider gay marriage like that - it wasn't a case of people-were-evil, more a case of social evolution. Now we're on the right side of that decision, it seems a bit pointless to retroactively lambast people unless they're still campaigning for it to be re-banned.

&gt;But you didn't answer my question: how long should people wait before they point out things like this (even if you may consider it desperate)?

No time at all, if it's a valid concern - but I'd expect to see something more damning than this sort of nonsense for it to be a legitimate worry - and so my initial comment (someone's hurting) was aimed at the newspaper for pretending it's an issue and the hundreds of upvotes that appear to assert that it is anyway.

I understand perfectly well how elections work thank you. What's the view like up there on your high horse?

&gt;They are not 'implementing/changing' whatever they feel like. They are implementing the policies a majority of us voted for.

That's the thing though, it was *far* from a majority of us that voted for them.

&gt;When people don't see through pre-election promises (Clegg?) then there is (a little) more reason to be upset.

How do you actually judge us as having over 30 first team players? Last year we had an XI and then that was basically it, and we didn't sign *that* many players in the summer.

Take the team for the game at Anfield against Chelsea at the end of last season:

Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Flanagan, Skrtel, Sakho, Gerrard, Allen, Lucas, Coutinho, Sterling, Suárez.

Subs: Jones, Toure, Agger, Cissokho, Alberto, Aspas, Sturridge.

That was with basically a full squad to choose from, aside from Henderson being suspended Enrique being injured. And we were still stuck with the likes of Cissokho, Alberto and Aspas on the bench - none of which are players I feel fans would ever be happy about us needing to bring on. I don't feel it that difficult to argue that in that side, we had nowhere near enough quality on the bench even with a fully fit squad, let alone with players out injured. 

So from that side we lost Suarez, Sissokho, Aspas and Agger, taking us down four. We added Can, Lambert, Lallana, Lovren, Markovic, Moreno and Balotelli, which means plus seven, or plus three overall. So now just about a starting XI plus a full bench of actual first-team quality so long as only one or two players are injured or suspended. And that's apparently us signing too many players?

We've had 25 players make league appearances for us this season. Firstly, that's nowhere near the ""over 30"" you talk about. Secondly, that's including Jerome Sinclaire, who has one appearance as a sub from today, and Enrique, who might as well no longer be in the squad considering how little he's fit. So pretty close to the ""at most 24"", which is a reasonable thing considering it includes players like Borini and Manquillo who were around at the start of the season but seem to have basically been dropped from the squad lately.

At the same time you're right it obviously wasn't all Rodgers because suarez naturally came into his prime and I don't think Rodgers has no faults this season but I think its harsh to say we regressed massively. We finished 7th ~ last 3 seasons before Rodgers and his first season. Last year was a massive overshot. Jumping that high in one season never happens. This season is just regressing to our average and were looking like were gonna finish 5th with barring last lesson is our best finish in 6 years all without any type of consistent striker (plus we made two cup semis which is pretty good even though we should've made the fa cup final). I know it wasn't pretty and our football is 1 tenth as exciting as least year its still very impressive considering a team like Tottenham who have a prolific striker and are having a great season by their standard are below us in the table. That plus the fact our team is real young and should be strengthened this summer had me feeling good for the future.

I know I defended Rodgers hard but I know he's not perfect and I wouldn't be apposed to a manager like klopp coming this summer if he wants but were in a great position with Rodgers barring nothing crazy happening in the next year or two.

null,false,DefluousBistup,null,null,null,"I've lived in Germany, Amsterdam and now live in Shanghai. For me the answer is simple and it's all about people. Ex-pats are a self selecting group of people. They are the ones from a country, the cream if you will, who are  looking for an adventure, they are looking for friends, they are looking for support and so are willing to give support. They know how to listen, they know how to share, they know how to enjoy life. They will meet you on their day off, take you to lunch and go across town to help you open a bank account - and you'd do the same. Then the locals that interact with you are also self selecting. They help you, maybe because they've lived abroad and know how hard it can be, but some are just proud to show their country in the best light and lead by example. Some, especially my experience in China, are just curious in a different face. After moving in to my new room and visiting the local shop twice, the third time the family that runs it pulled me in for dinner at the back, called their neighbours round and had a good  laugh at me while we ate (I don't speak chinese). But it's all good fun.

Sure, there is the other side, people will try and take advantage of you, but there's a limited set of techniques they can use all over the world and once you've been cheated a couple of times you learn how to deal with those situations. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the UK. The last place I was in was Hereford and I've not been to a more welcoming place in the UK except for my years at uni in Leeds (also self selecting group of people). I don't go abroad to find a better place, I go for something different, a new experience, to remove the moss that gathers on your back. Everytime has been hard, but the people I meet have always made it worth while. The grass isn't always greener, but how cool would it be if the grass was bamboo on the other side.

As a footnote, expats aren't just english people of course. They're people from all over the world.

I've lived in China and Singapore, and have seen the failures of the authoritarian left and right. Authoritarianism may well command fear, but it rarely commands respect. Liberalism - cooperation, on the other hand, does.

I'm a liberal because I find I can no longer trust the left to come up with a sensible economic policy no matter how they reform their party. New Labour was a disaster and Ed Milliband's manifesto made no sense. The right cannot be trusted to care about the country. I want a moderate, workable economic policy.

I am a liberal because I am pragmatic. There is a clear link between national efficiency and human rights, a link which all other parties conveniently neglect.

I'm a Malaysian living in the UK and I want to be able to be proud of my home as much as I am proud to be here, without being hissed at because some of my countrymen have been overstaying and 'scrounging' benefits. And for that, we need a sensible immigration policy - which only the Lib Dems provide.

The idea that underpins the Orange Book ideology is that we should generally favour market solutions over others - it's a much more 19th century sort of Liberal ideal. For me, liberalism should be putting forward an economic plan that is much more consistent with our basic belief in personal liberty, and recognises that laissez-faire markets are morally a bull in a china shop - they don't take our values into account, and so we need to take a much more careful, dispassionate approach to them that doesn't imply that markets are necessarily a good or bad thing - they're an economic tool, good for some tasks and poor at others.

I teeter awkwardly on the far left of the party, so shouldn't be considered representative at all, by my preferred form of liberalism takes a much more distinctive approach to economics - prioritising small business over large, keeping things at arms length so local government has more spending power, taking strong steps to avoid corporatist build-ups whereby too much power and wealth is concentrated in the hands of too few people and companies, and most importantly pushing to stop too much unearned wealth in society.

It baffles me that people cannot recognize, or are unwilling to accept it: Suarez carried that whole team last year. Rodgers, the players around him, everyone. Take away Suarez, his goals, and all the chances he created last season, and where do we finish? Fifth maybe? Rodgers probably would have been sacked since if I remember correctly, finishing top 4 was the ultimatum last year.

As for Balotelli, that was a mess from the beginning. I should say, I really like Mario, and while some of the criticism on here is warranted, a lot of it isn't. I think he's a good player and has the potential to be great. Regardless, the problem is, the club were desperate for a marquee signing, and Mario was it. However, it was obvious from the beginning that Brendan had no interest in making it work. His man-management of Balotelli has been abysmal, and he's refused to play Mario in a role that suits him best: as a second striker. Thats tactically very poor on Rodgers' part. 

Yes, my criticisms of Rodgers are reactionary. But they are not kneejerk reactions to the last month. They have been building since the start of this season, and I think they're well founded criticisms based on objectivity. And Suarez/Balotelli are far from my only problems I have with him.

That's not how democracy works, mate. While this is still a free society, we have the right to make our voices heard. We have the right to stand up and shout about it. We have the right to post what we want on the internet.

11.3 million people voted Conservative. The rest of us didn't. We didn't because a hell of a lot of people have gone through hell as a result of austerity, cuts and other things that the Tories did in the five years they just had.

But we were lucky. It could have been a lot worse. The LibDems held the Tories back and voted down a lot of their worst policies. Now, we don't have a coalition to stop us from the worst the Tories want to do to us and that makes a hell of a lot of us scared stiff, so we do what we can in a free, democratic society.

We have improved but we were at rock bottom before rodgers came.

he said something in todays post match which was very telling. he mentioned how chelsea have had three players walk in to their team this year and we have had three players go. (suarez, studge and flano) 

its funny that he didnt mention any of the players he brought however because they have mainly been flops.

Ask yourself if you honestly think next season will be better. do you honestly think the players we have now, without a star to help carry them, will be able to compete with the top 4? Dont forget that city and united are bound to get some big players this summer.

if the answer is no then ask yourself if you think we can get big players to come to us this summer? the answer is unlikely.

I am a civil libertarian, and have some very strong, and sometimes extreme, views on the individual, and think the only party that comes close to me is the libdems. Both the tories and Labour are crap on surveillance, 

Economically, my views are in part close to German Ordoliberalism, and its one of the reasons i could never be a tory, despite coming from a tory family. Their ideological obsession with absolute free markets and lack of important regulation irritates me to no end. I believe in trying to create a society based off meritocracy and equality of opportunity, and giving everyone the best chance in life. 

Politically i am very progressive and forward thinking. Some of the biggest political changes in history have been based in fundamental liberal ideas. We need to push for some form of PR, house of lords reform and to improve, liberalise and reform our political system.

I wont bore you all with too much detail about my views. But all in all, i am slightly worried that the party will move to the left, leaving me as someone who is already to the right of the party, with a choice to either stay in a party economically to the left of me, or go back to the tories, where they are crap on civil liberties and social liberalism. 

The way i always think of liberalism, is we are very good at winning the ideological war, but crap at winning and regularly lose the political battles.

The architecture is amazing, the waterfront view of the three graces is iconic, St. George's Hall is immense, plus the city has the distinction of having two eye-catching cathedrals. The streets within the city centre around Moorfields feel akin to east coast American downtowns, not like a typical English city.

There is a host of things to do in both day and nighttime. There are a load of museums, for example the Liverpool World Museum, the Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum and the TATE Art Gallery amongst others. 
Shopping wise there are numerous mainstream shops at the main shopping centre Liverpool One, and in the surrounding areas like Church Street and the Met Quarter. Church Street especially always feels bustling with life, and typically there is a lot of street performers and buskers. For more quirky and alternative shops there is a lot of choice around Bold Street and Grand Central (Quiggins).

Liverpool is home to two big soccer teams, Liverpool FC and Everton FC. Liverpool are historically massive and currently owned by John Henry, owner of the Red Sox in Boston. Everton are historically another one of the best English teams, and currently have USMNT's Tim Howard in goal. 
Elsewhere there is the racecourse at Aintree which hosts the biggest annual horse race in the UK, the grand national.

For music and nightlife Liverpool is one of the top places in the country. The ECHO arena is the venue for big chart artists as well as events like WWE, gymnastics, and the Strictly tour. Away from the mainstream there are plenty of smaller more intimate venues such as the O2 academy, Zanzibar, and the Shipping Forecast. Liverpool is also where Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and The Beatles call home. 
Liverpool is awash with clubs and pubs to drink your sorrows away, the main areas being concert square (younger crowd mostly) and Mathew Street (home of the Cavern Club). You'll bump into a load of characters on a weekend night out, and be sure to have a boss time. 

Also, Liverpool is a seaside town. Whilst it's not tropical weather the beaches up Crosby (Iron Men), Formby (where there is a red squirrel reserve) and Southport (old seaside town) are pretty decent. 

Regardless of your choice the local train system links both Chester and Liverpool to Ellesmere Port on the same line, so all the above can be easily travelled to. Chester is a nice city with a Roman history, the accent will probably be easier to understand there too. Both cities would be fine to live in, in my opinion.

The Abused have been going to the police for years and have faced cover ups or stonewalling tactics for decades.

The abused and the MPs fighting to get this inquiry going have the backing of the public almost overwhelmingly to find out whether organised child sex abuse was being orchestrated from the cover of westminster.
It is clear that even as you admit Gove, Tebbit and many others believe abuse was going on and in light of the claims of cover up which have hung over this debacle denying the victims a full public inquiry and relying on the police, who have already been tarnished with claims of participating in the cover up is an extremely poor choice. It does nothing to dispel the fear that the Tories have no stomach for getting to grip with this serious matter.

But you go on and claim its clickbait, right? I'm sure the police can be trusted *this* time and I'm sure this doesn't look an extremely poor decision by Cameron and Gove. LoL take the blinkers off pal.

MPs called for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse to cover the whole of the UK, rather than just England and Wales.

A report by the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said claims of abuse at a Belfast children’s home in the 1970s meant crimes could be intertwined and investigated together.

They don't seem to really want to get to the bottom of this, which quite frankly is extremely disturbing. A public inquiry covering all parts of the UK involved in these historic and unprecedented claims is the only way to settle this once and for all.

- Stunning unspoilt scenery and natural beauty, year round (there's a difference between rolling farmland and woodland which is completely wilderness)
- Summers are fantastic comparatively, stretching from around now to mid October and plenty of sunny days.
- Jobs. I work in software engineering and metropolitan Detroit is at the beginning of a tech boom due to low rents. Some cool west coast style companies around, without the cost of living you see in silicon valley.
- Variety of food is great. Yes, there's fast food but also plenty of healthy food supermarkets and even a 'western europe' section in one of them with Ribena and Digestives
- Warmth of people in the Midwest
- Cost of buying a house. My wife and I are looking at houses in the $140,000 dollar range, with a downpayment of about $7000 (£4000). We would still be renting if we were in parts of the UK right now.
- Healthcare is great in quality for us.

Cons:
- Healthcare is still expensive, and I don't like the idea of people going without due to some chance life event.
- Michigan winters. They get old very fast - with the amount of snow and bitter cold winds which never seem to end. At least in the UK the cold snaps only last about a week or two.
- Television. We're canceling cable because there's just no point watching TV with adverts every 3 minutes, especially after being spoiled by Netflix. At least there's VPN for iPlayer.
- Everything is so far away. Supermarket is a 45 minute round trip, work is 35 minutes each way with no traffic (a rarity), and Chicago is still 5 hours away. I miss walking places. 
- Drivers are nuts here. I miss the high bar of entry the UK test enforces.

All in all though, it's not a bad option. Depends entirely on your personal situation, not to mention personality. I wanted something bigger, with more to see and do at my age and budget - and I'm terrible with languages.

I don't think he's said anything to imply he wouldn't be happy for those things. But since we don't know the reasons he had for being against an inquiry there isn't much point pontificating.

Personally, I abhor what seems to have happened and am in favour of justice being served. However, I'm not sure it's a good use of taxpayers' money to set about an inquiry into stuff from the 50s and 60s, though. Our child protection environment now is just *unrecognisable* from what we had back then and I am confident that no major changes to what we have now would come out of such an inquiry--it certainly wouldn't be a cost-efficient way to bring about those changes.

(Compare that to, say, the inquiry into phone hacking which was a 'live' issue and brought about real changes in how things are done.)

I found [this](https://fullfact.org/law/conservative-party-bill-of-rights-39308/), which seems to be the clearest indication of what the proposed British Bill of rights would consist of:

&gt; The Conservatives want to limit the use of a British Bill of Rights to “the most serious cases”, so it won’t cover “trivial” issues. At present, human rights arguments can be used in any case where they’re relevant.

So who's going to decide what's trivial or serious? Do we want a charter of human rights that only covers *some* people and *some* cases.

&gt; They also want human rights laws to be restricted in terms of who can use them. The Conservatives cite the examples of “a foreign national who takes the life of another person”, and “terrorists”, who would be prevented from invoking human rights law to resist being deported.

Here we are again with limiting who it applies to. Again, who decides who's a terrorist? The dictionary definition and legal definition is pretty damn vague. Honestly, this opens us up for creating our own Guantanamo Bay, where ""enemy combatants"" were stripped of the human rights and degraded and tortured in the most vile ways...oh and then it was discovered that some of them weren't enemy combatants after all.

Oh but the Conservatives are infallible, eh? They couldn't possibly get the wrong man, could they? Shall I look up a list of all the innocent people various UK Governments and courts hanged when the death penalty was still legal?

The death penalty, yes. That thing that Michael Gove said he wanted to bring back. The same Michael Gove who's now in charge of the Ministry of Justice...

Repayment of student fees are often taken direct out of earnings. Many us of us pay our phone bills and local rates by direct debit. I don't see it as vastly different.

And actually, in the case of failure to pay in the latter two cases, heavy fines and escalations can ensue, with court summons and debt collection agencies getting involved. you might be doing some people a financial favour by collecting the unpaid water rate in the way you're describing. Alternative routes of collecting unpaid utility bills can be a great deal more costly for the individual. 

Anyway, I'm not here as a spokesperson for FG and I don't live in the ROI. I only commented that I have admiration for their fiscal pragmatics, and their existence as a centre right party in a see of lazy leftist consensus in Ireland. Many in Europe have an admiration for the way the ROI have turned around an extremely difficult financial situation and returned to growth where other countries in a similar boat have not. The difference appears strongly to be FG took the difficult choices necessary and DIDNT pretend that to keep on spending money the country doesn't have was the right way forward.

However, if you really want hot chat on water charges in the ROI you're probably going to have to find a buddy on r/ireland.

It is difficult to recall the shock with which we realised our alienation from the events taking place in front of us. Robinson's first reaction was one of spleen. There were, he said, no mitigating circumstances; the press, the voting system, the impropriety of Tory party funding. None of these could explain away the fact that the middle class in England had continued to vote Conservative because in their miserable hearts they still believed it was in their interest to do so. Robinson began to consider what this result would mean for him. His flat would continue to deteriorate and its rent increase. He would be intimidated by vandalism and petty crime. The bus service would get worse. There would be more traffic and noise pollution and an increased risk of getting knocked down crossing the road. There would be more drunks pissing in the street when he looked out of the window and more children taking drugs on the stairs when he came home at night. His job would be at risk and subjected to interference. His income would decrease. He would drink more and less well. He would be ill more often. He would die sooner.

&gt;___Harry &amp; Paul___ (originally titled ___Ruddy Hell! It's Harry &amp; Paul___) is a [BAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA) Award-winning British [sketch comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy) show starring [Harry Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Enfield) and [Paul Whitehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Whitehouse). It was first broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 13 April 2007. Prior to broadcast it was trailed as ___The Harry Enfield Show___.

&gt;The show reunites the pair, who had success with *[Harry Enfield's Television Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Enfield%27s_Television_Programme)* in the 1990s. 

&gt;The second series of the programme began on BBC One on 5 September 2008. This was the last series from the comedy producer [Geoffrey Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Perkins) who died shortly before the programme's second series began.  A third series was commissioned and began 28 September 2010 this time on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) to where the show has been moved, because of falling ratings.  The fourth series began broadcasting in October 2012.

Perhaps you can quote a part of of the HRA or the ECHR that the HRA enacts in law, that specifically states nobody can be jailed for life, because I've been through both and found no reference to maximum sentences.

EDIT: correction: life imprisonment is actually a thing in the UK. 25 years is just the minimum eligibility period for parole [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales)",null,0,null,1431321949,null,0,1431322267,0,cr58l10,null,t3_35hkyp,null,t1_cr58l10,null,t1_cr56wlb,null,null,null,1432890336,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,valleyshrew,null,null,null,"It's like saying opposing the patriot act means you hate the country. The human rights act is not the be all end all of human rights. They are not an inarguable law, they are made up by biased humans. 

&gt;No discrimination – everyone’s rights are equal. You should not be treated unfairly – because, for example, of your gender, race, sexuality, religion or age;

A lot of the laws discriminate based on age. Is it a human rights abuse that 12 year olds can't get a driver's license?

&gt;the right to an education

That's another ageist one, adults aren't given free education. It's a privilege provided by countries rich enough to give it, not a right. Some poorer countries cannot afford to provide free education to all of their people.

&gt;Free speech and peaceful protest

Westboro baptist church were banned from entering the UK for being pacifist preachers who merely have religious views that are disliked and protesting about them publicly, and I seem to recall that people here are proud of the UK for not letting them in. If they were allowed in they would undoubtedly be arrested for hate speech, which violates their right to free speech and peaceful protest. This is one human right I actually agree with, but I'm pointing it out because most in the UK and the law as it is already do not agree with it.

&gt;The prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment – you should never be tortured or treated in an inhuman or degrading way, no matter what the situation

The UN considers solitary confinement to be torture. That's widely used in prisons and supported by the British public. There's a huge difference between that kind of torture, and the kind the Nazis performed during WW2. To call them all human rights abuses is naive and simplistic. Almost all detective shows on television have a guilty person being tortured (being threatened during interrogation is considered torture) at some point, and the person doing it is considered a hero for going beyond the law to get justice. Calling it ""torture"" biases people against it without thought, if you show the actual acts then people can approve of them depending on what they are and the circumstance. [Even violent torture could be justified if it was able to prevent an imminent act of nuclear terrorism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/). I can't imagine any reasonable person reading that link that would still have blanket opposition to torture afterwards.

One of the human rights not listed here that is common is the right to not have your religious views defamed, which the UN Human Rights council passed a resolution on in 2010. I doubt many people here support that, so you must be an evil human rights opposer! 

Another thing is that there are exceptions written where human rights can be violated for basically any reason at all - ""restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.",null,1,null,1431321974,null,0,1431324816,0,cr58ldn,null,t3_35hkyp,null,t1_cr58ldn,null,t1_cr4gwj8,null,null,null,1432890340,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

It also looks as though they are using zonal marking. In the first goal, Mason should be able to clearly see the man in front of him and track him. He however decides to take up the space just infront of the back 4. In addition to this, Jan is marking a space in between Chriches and Fazio. I can't blame Chiriches at all for this goal, he may have been able to get tighter to his man, but the initial cross was not very dangerous and all in all, it was the subsequent mistakes that cost the goal.

Bentalab should be taking up Jan's position for me. That frees up Jan to mark the guy who Fazio is marking, Fazio then drops back to Adam and Dier marks the winger. In a normal system, it would be the winger's job to cover the zone in which Jan is covering. In a system where the wingers have been instructed to stay high (ours it seems), its the CDM's responsibility to take up those positions, not the CB's.

This is highlighted in the lead up to the second goal. This is almost perfect positioning IMO. As we can see Lamela is slightly higher up the pitch, which is fine because Bentaleb is covering the space inside Jan. The issue here is Chiriches. I'd say if we shift the remaining back 3 2cm towards the top of the picture, the positioning is perfect and we don't concede. However, as you mention, Chiriches is marking his own shadow. Maybe he was wary of a ball down the line. But in this shot there is no attacker who is posing a threat down the line at that moment. Bentalab has that covered.

The Latino population in the US was long considered marginal, but they tend to have large families and in the past few generations they've rapidly increased. Within a few decades Spanish will be the first language of the majority of the US population, and already spanish-language television ratings are where the main networks were 30 years ago.

Muslims, too, have larger families than the Western average. But that number is decreasing worldwide, and muslim fertility rates are falling to come closer to the western standard, so growth won't be as fast as the latinos in the US, and the population is also not as established. Estimates are that the muslim population of the UK will double in the next 15 years, but even if they had 100% voter turnout (impossible, not least because many will be under 18), they'll have the power equivalent to the Lib Dem share of the vote this time around.

However, if in this fantasyland, *today's* muslim population were to suddenly all reach at least the age of majority, and were all to vote for the same party, they would be able to vote with a power equivalent to the SNP share of the vote, and we can anticipate that *that* party will have significant influence over the next parliament.

But in order to get even this minority influence we have to go so far down the rabbit hole: We have to change dates of birth, we have to get all of them to the polls with no exceptions, we have to get them all to vote for one party -- we even have to get them *all* to move to live in specific constituencies in order to tip the vote. *And even then they'll be the third or fourth party*.

Even if they suddenly became the No.1 party, they'll be prevented from taking power unless they pledge commitment to the British constitution.

&gt;__Gladstonian liberalism__ is a political doctrine named after the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) and leader of the [Liberal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK\)), [William Ewart Gladstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone). Gladstonian liberalism consisted of limited government expenditure and low taxation whilst making sure government had balanced budgets and the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice. Gladstonian liberalism also emphasised [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade), little government intervention in the economy and [equality of opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_of_opportunity) through institutional reform. It is referred to as *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* or [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) in the UK.

&gt;Repayment of student fees are often taken direct out of earnings. Many us of us pay our phone bills and local rates by direct debit. I don't see it as vastly different.
 
The difference being that the customer agreed to these charges being deducted. They set up these DDs,  the government has never tried to recoup the charges you mention directly, without permission.

&gt;And actually, in the case of failure to pay in the latter two cases, heavy fines and escalations can ensue, with court summons and debt collection agencies getting involved. you might be doing some people a financial favour by collecting the unpaid water rate in the way you're describing. Alternative routes of collecting unpaid utility bills can be a great deal more costly for the individual.

People are already very aware that there's potential court appearances for non payment, they don't need this scaremongering. They've made it clear how they feel about these charges. The people have spoke and they're saying ""no more"".

&gt;However, if you really want hot chat on water charges in the ROI you're probably going to have to find a buddy on r/ireland.

I never wanted a ""hot chat"" on water charges, I was merely using it as one of many examples of what we'd be up against if FG were in power here.

For example, the national decline in the Lib Dem vote was 15.1 percentage points. But the average decline in Lib Dem seats was actually slightly higher, at 15.7 percentage points.

In Twickenham, Vince Cable's vote dropped by 16.4 percentage points - Vince actually underperformed the national party.

There were only a handful of seats where candidates stemmed the decline in their vote share to the low single digits. Many of these were in Scotland (East Dunbartonshire -2.4ppt, Edinburgh West -2.8ppt, Gordon -3.3ppt, Argyll and Bute -3.7ppt), where I'd argue it had as much to do with unionist tactical voting as popular Lib Dem candidates.

Of the rest, the best cases for an incumbency effect in the lost seats look like Bradford East (-4.2 percentage points) and Cambridge (-4.3 percentage points).",null,0,null,1431325847,null,0,false,0,cr59ujn,null,t3_35hllp,null,t1_cr59ujn,null,t1_cr53s5t,null,null,null,1432890931,null,3,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,3,null

gloating.

Not everyone feels the same way about politics as you. Not everyone is as pleased about the Conservative victory as you.

A lot of redditors here are disappointed that the Conservatives are in power again with about 37% of the vote from 25% of the electorate and won 51% of the seats.

A lot of people here don't believe austerity is the right way to respond to a recession, believe instead the Keynesian ideas that cutting the public sector would reduce demand and result in lower tax revenue so the deficit persists; that a stimulus, putting money into the public sector to increase demand, would have worked with less damaging effect on the poor.

So they're annoyed when, with a deficit still there, they hear the Chancellor (who had promised to balance the books in five years) saying austerity must go further instead of saying ""Um, maybe we've got it wrong"".

A lot of people here don't believe what appears in the Daily Mail and The Sun. People here know how to spell Anjem Choudry and know that most Muslims aren't trying to convert us or kill us. They also know that Abu Hamza was eventually extradited to the US _without_ needing to change the HRA or abandon the ECHR, once it could be guaranteed that he wouldn't be subjected to inhumane treatment.

A lot of people here know that most immigrants don't claim benefits as much as UK nationals do, tend to cost the country less money and help to increase GDP.

A lot of people here think Cameron is an idiot for suggesting that secure encryption is a bad thing; they also think Teresa May is dangerous when she suggests more state surveillance is necessary and further that people should be rendered stateless (who else has introduced laws that left people stateless? Saddam. Hitler.)

This act of vandalism is the clear work of someone who has been spoonfed a diet of hating the Tories. For all the accusation a of Tory party which ran a divisive campaign, Labour ran a campaign which can basically be condensed into the three words on that memorial. As has been said, they offered no serious alternative and instead played on people's hate of the Tories. And then you end up with that.

&gt; The short version? The Human Rights Act is not written into the Scotland Act. This is misleading, and increasingly unhelpful, shorthand. Under the devolution legislation, Acts of the Scottish Parliament and decisions of Scottish ministers must comply with European Convention rights.
&gt; 
&gt; If they do not, you can take your case to the Court of Session, inviting judges to strike the offending laws or decisions down. The powers of both the legislature and executive are checked. But the Human Rights Act goes further, requiring all public authorities in the United Kingdom - prisons, police officers, councils - to respect your rights to free expression, privacy, property, liberty, and so on. We have two distinct human rights regimes in this country, and if the HRA is repealed, it will require only Holyrood and the Scottish Ministers to take these fundamental rights into account.
&gt; 
&gt; But there is another important technicality here. Human rights aren't reserved matters under the Scotland Act. The Human Rights Act is a protected enactment under Schedule 4 of the devolution legislation -- meaning that Holyrood cannot repeal or amend it -- but human rights are devolved. Several stormy legal and political consequences flow from these facts, more fully explored in my 2014 blog.
&gt; 
&gt; So, big questions for Mr Gove: will your government attempt to eliminate the ECHR rights enshrined in the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Acts? What if Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast reject the idea? Will you crack on anyway? What if the majorities in the devolved legislatures do not approve of your British Bill of Rights? Will you respect and recognise their democratic mandates, or employ Westminster sovereignty to ram the replacement through? As human rights are not a reserved matter, will you seek the legislative consent of Holyrood to repeal devolved aspects of the Human Rights Act, and if this is not forthcoming, how will you respond?",null,0,null,1431327745,null,0,false,0,cr5adpi,null,t3_35hkyp,null,t1_cr5adpi,null,t1_cr54ccj,null,null,null,1432891182,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The same could be said of any nationality. And don't support the English rugby team if you don't want to be English. There's no point. 

&gt; what it means to be English is completely subordinate to class, region, ethnicity and local culture

&gt; as for no other nation on these islands – what it means to be English is completely subordinate to class, region, ethnicity and local culture

He clearly hasn't been to any of the other nations on these islands. There is an element of class in England but an English identity isn't subordinate to it. It's also not subordinate to ethnicity. I'd like to know what he's trying to imply there. And as for local culture, if you visit Scotland, Wales, either NI or Ireland or most other nations, you'll find that different parts of the country will have their own local culture or regional identity. 

&gt;&gt;In terms of place, I’ve always been pulled towards high mountains, craggy coastlines and wild, western seas. 
&gt; and in Cornwall where I spent every summer of my childhood.

So he doesn't want to be English and uses landscape he likes as a point but then mentions an area in England which has that type of landscape. He should have just talked about Wales. 

&gt; If you were to run English history since the Roman empire on fast forward, you would see wave after wave of invaders arriving by ship, depositing new words into the language and new hair colours into the gene pool – but barely settling before they embark on new ships to go and find new places to colonise and trade with.

How is this relevant? And these invaders did settle. How does he think England came into existence?

You'll notice something very important. Spurs are ranked #20 in Europe which means a very high seed (Pot 1, 2 mostly, rarely 3) for any competitions we entered. If you are wondering why Man City (rank #17) were perennially entered into the 'group of death' in the champions league - this table explains it perfectly - If you want to know how Liverpool (rank #42) got Madrid and Basel in their CL group - its because they were in Pot 3. It is now, only after 4 years or so that Man City might finally make it into a good group but they had to do it the hard way - by beating tough teams (i.e. Dortmund, Barca and Munich).

So Europa has a purpose of keeping our coefficient points ticking over so that if we ever get into the Champions League we have a **chance** of getting out the group stage.

Last point from me, skating through the groups and early knockout stages isn't very hard as long as you take care and rotate your squad (a lot). To be fair to Poch in recent press conferences he has confessed that this was the first time his training team has had to cope with European competition we would all hope he has learned a few lessons.

I know some ppl might think that our Thursday/Sunday record proves our inability to cope (others would point to other teams around Europe inability to cope). I would point to in riposte (Mr Rotation himself - Benitez) who has his team sat nicely in 4th (in Serie A) and are poised (1-1 draw 1st leg) in a Europa League Semi (note: Fiorentina are sat in 5th - but of course if they win their semi they'll qualify for the UCL).",null,0,null,1431333032,null,0,false,0,cr5bls8,null,t3_35ftgm,null,t1_cr5bls8,null,t3_35ftgm,null,null,null,1432891759,null,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

&gt;__Slemish__, historically called __Slieve Mish__  (from [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Sliabh Mis*),  is a mountain in [County Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). It lies a few miles east of [Ballymena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballymena), in the [townland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townland) of Carnstroan. Tradition holds that [Saint Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick), enslaved as a youth, was brought to this area and tended [sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep) herds on Slemish, and that during this time he found God.

&gt;Slemish is the remains of the [plug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_plug) of an [extinct volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_volcano). Its distinctive appearance —its upper reaches are very steep and rugged, in contrast to the tidy fields on its lower westward-facing slopes and the relatively flat bogland to the east— causes it to dominate the landscape for miles around.

&gt;Slemish is within an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps to protect and manage the fragile animal and plant communities that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits can be seen regularly.

No, its not dishonest to claim they were socialists, and not just in name only.

As for Drexler, he was making clear they were not Marxist - as they were directing their brand of socialism to their preferred group, the Aryan 'race'. He wasn't denying there were socialists! He wanted to distance the party from Marxist overtones that would unnerve the middle-classes.

There are other articles I could point you to - but you'd just dismiss them as it would not suit your agenda.

It makes uncomfortable reading for socialists to turn from their long held warm and fuzzy mantra, that left wing means caring for everyone and right wing = evil fascists, and they could possibly do no wrong, when many socialist movements have caused the deaths of millions. (and yes, I'm also saying Stalin and Hitler had much in common - totalitarian regimes with Socialism at their *source*).

And, no, I'm not saying that capitalism is guiltless, far from it!

Politics are not black and white. I'm surprised I've have to point it out to you - but then again it wouldn't suit your agenda.

Its also very indicative of your replies, since this thread started, that your referred to me (as a Tory voter) as 'scum', I should (apparently) be ashamed of myself and also casually dismiss vandalism of a war monument as a one-off, without condemning it,(oh the irony, since the vast majority of the returning troops voted overwhelmingly for Labour in the GE of 1945) - and indicates just what sort of left-winger you seem to be.

I don't think so. Twitter is a really shitty medium for asking questions of your MP. I have written to my MP many many times and I have always recieved very long and thought out responses, not quick off the cuff 1 liners in under 140 words.

As for the EU, I honestly don't believe the Tories will want to leave.  I think they'll give a referendum to appease those that do, but ultimately will argue in favour, in fact I think Cameron even said himself he'd want to stay in.  Ultimately few businesses will want to leave and support from the public to stay in is creeping up each day.

Don't refuse to be discharged because it suits you better to leave tomorrow - you wouldn't do it if you paid the hundreds of pounds per night an NHS bed costs. Don't make an appointment then fail to turn up. Don't refuse vaccinations because you think you know better than medical science. Party responsibly. Quit smoking. Don't be rude.*

*We have some of the highest quality free-at-point-of-access medical care in the world. It's not just the politicians responsibility to ensure this can continue. The NHS is for the provision of medical care only - be grateful you don't have to walk ten miles in bare feet and on an empty stomach for it.

Simply, we cannot, as a country, run out of money as is happening in Greece and other afflicted Euro countries. The Bank of England can inject more cash into the system as it has done (QE) at the risk of increasing inflation. At this point in time, the government could borrow money for basically nothing because inflation is low and the base rate is as low as it has been since records began. 

To me, the deficit reduction plan reeks of an ideological war, which is fuelled by a mistaken belief that the last Labour government caused the financial crisis from overspending. Even if the government does ""balance the books"" all we have accomplished is not borrowing more than we take in tax revenues. Then what? Paying down the £1.5 trillion of national debt is impossible in a reasonable time frame. Even with zero interest it would take a ridiculous amount of time to pay back.

If however you implement austerity, people have less money so they spend less money which helps stagnate the economy.

A guy calling in said it was the first time he'd voted Tory, and got very heated denouncing Kinnock and co. who insist on declaring that anyone who votes Tory is selfish. It was a very revealing call about how many now see the Left.

There was an article in the Independent wherein the author made it plainly clear that the self-righteousness of the Left was off putting and pushes people away from the sanctimony.

And yet despite that you all seem to sit there in your foxhole claiming moral superiority at any expense, inciting hatred against people who earn good money, devoid of even the slightest shred of respect that they have clearly put in effort to improve their chances in life, demanding that meritocracy be dead, and then topping it all off with some banal assertion that 'there are real lives at stake'. Yeah no shit, mate, but the Tories aren't going to round up the poor and shoot them in a mass grave.

I honestly can't comprehend how the Left can insist on this stance.

There were *accusations* that he edited his Wikipedia page. The edit came from a computer at the law firm where he was working. He has never admitted doing it. The edit was made in 2007.

""We are all capitalists now"" is pretty much a statement of fact. We live in a capitalist society based on a capitalist economic system. Anyway, here are some exerpts from another speech he gave, full text [here](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/chuka-umunnas-speech-better-capitalism-full-text). 

&gt;Because if we are to build a better capitalism, we must stamp out the fast buck irresponsible practices that precipitated the crash for which our communities are still paying the price.

...
&gt; And therefore Co-operatives must be central to our future, to a better and more productive capitalism.

Anyway, context for the 5 word soundbite which seems to be the basis for plenty of op-ed pieces in the Guardian, this time from the [FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4e3ed714-7f87-11e3-b6a7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3ZovNOwRs):

&gt;In Mr Miliband’s line of sight are various industries which he believes are failing consumers: banking, housebuilding, betting companies; energy companies and the pensions industry.
The Labour leader said on Friday it was not “anti-business” to promote more competition, as he outlined plans to break up Britain’s largest retail banks.

&gt;The message is more subtle than the business-bashing that characterised Labour politics a generation ago. Instead the Labour leader has forged a platform designed to champion consumers, workers and small business – often at the expense of big business.

&gt;“The big difference between 1979 and 2013 is that we are all capitalists now,” says Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary and a former corporate lawyer.

&gt;“The question is what sort of capitalism do we want? We embrace free markets but we want competitive and free markets and more responsible capitalism.”

So what he was actually saying was a bit less pro-business than some people would have you believe. The man from YouGov saw it as 'banker-bashing'. 

He has the backing of Peter Mandelson - well Mandy said Umunna was on the right track, but he didn't back him because he hasn't announced he'll run. There also isn't anything he can do about who decides to back him. If Tony Blair backed Andy Burnham would you then say you aren't voting for him?

From my current understanding, top economists are split on the merits of austerity -- the argument seems to be reduce borrowing to reduce interest payments on debt vs increase spending to stimulate the economy and grow your way out of debt. Here are some notable economists I know of whose opinions are worth checking out:

For austerity:

- Carmen Reinhart
- Kenneth Rogoff


Against Austerity:

- Robert Shiller
- Paul Krugman
- Steve Keen

&amp;nbsp;

For the record, at present, I'm neither for nor against austerity -- I have not made my mind up on it yet. I probably should have done this prior to the election, but over the next few weeks I plan on doing some personal research so that I can build a more informed opinion on this.

As long as new increased tax intake &gt; the money you invested then you are good to go.

This economic theory is called [kenyesian economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics_) and we've used it multiple times in the past. Most notably after WWII when we built the welfare state and NHS even though we were bankrupt. Also after the great depression, however it fell out of fashion with the dawn of neoliberalism in the 80s.

The problem with austerity is it just makes everyone poorer. When you slash public spending you are making a whole tonne of people unemployed, they stop spending money, businesses suffer, they make more people unemployed, they all go on benefits and then stop spending and make more people unemployed etc.

The government's tax intake falls and then the government cuts even more and the cycle gets worse. 

In my view it sounds like madness and is probably ideologically motivated. You are supposed to spend when times are hard and collect money when times are good, that's pretty much conventional economics wisdom. But our governments seem to have done the opposite. In essence I feel the Tories are using the financial crisis as an excuse to bring down public spending and push the things they already wanted.

Opponents of austerity point out the conservative Party's own economic watchdog openly attacked them for damaging the economy, stating austerity cost us about half our GDP growth. They have failed to meet their deficit reduction targets and their solution is to cut even deeper. It's unprecedented in our economic history that we have still not recovered our pre-recession levels of productivity 7 years on.

Feel free to answer it, rather that just dismissing it (and me) though - I'm always happy to learn.

Having said that, I'm pretty sure that the use of fiscal stimulus is considered a valid approach in Keynesian terms as a method to combat economic slowdown and risk of recession, though perhaps better suited to manufacturing economies.  I mean, if we look at the 2008-09 period, we can see more rapid recoveries in the economies that applied greater levels of  fiscal stimulus through spending (such as Germany, Canada, Australia).  Admittedly this has gone out of fashion now, with even Germany warning against this kind of stimulus at recent G20 meetings.  Though interestingly, there is seen as somewhat contentious given their own approach previously, and perhaps more focused on protecting their status as a G8 nation than anything else.

I suppose, that given that the UK is a mainly service and financial based economy (rather than manufacturing) that you could argue that the monetary stimulus approach that we have seen (QE, very low interest rates) is more appropriate, but given that this seems to have had little impact on treasury revenues, but has seemed more to support just the financial sector, it could be argued that a more mixed approach could have led to a more rapid and broad economic recovery?

I had ~~happily~~ reluctantly got my £20 out of the cash point on the Monday morning on the way to the bus station, hopped on the bus and pushed it over to the driver. 

""A weekly ticket, please"", I chirped.

The driver looked at me like I had just simultaneously pissed on his cornflakes, kicked his dog and eaten his last rolo without permission.

""It's £21 mate"", he replied acidly. 

I blinked. ""Oh, it was £19 last week""

""£21 mate"", he barked back.

I scraped through my pockets for change and miraculously found a fiver in the back pocket of my jeans, remnants from the Friday night at the pub. I handed it over to him.

The driver, again, looked at it, then back up at me. This time with full on scorn and disgust.

""I've not got enough change for that. I'll have to print you a change note"". 

How a bus driver thought he was going to manage the rest of the day without £4 in change is beyond me.

I wandered off to the back of the bus feeling deflated. Unsurprisingly, I saw a similar thing happen to countless people getting on the bus during my travels.

I put the change note in my wallet and forgot about it. 

The next Monday rolls along and I made sure I had enough money in change for the, frankly, heinously inconvenient £21 ticket price. When I stepped onto the bus, however, I remembered my change ticket. 

""One weekly ticket please"".

Not as much as a grunt from the driver. 

Fine, then. I paid the driver (the *same* driver from the week prior, no less) in a £20 note and a £4 change note. He looked at me with eyes that wished a life of despair to me and my family, but begrudgingly accepted it and gave me £3 in precious £1 coins.

Labour were attacked for wanting to increase the deficit in real terms in order to try to shrink the debt in proportional terms with a rapid-growth economy. The Conservatives' plan is to shrink the deficit enough to freeze the debt in real terms and hopefully decrease it in proportional terms with a slow-growing economy.

&gt; The internal auditor said the IMF should have known that the combination of tight fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy would be less effective in boosting growth after a crisis. Evidence showed that the private sector's focus on reducing debt made it less susceptible to monetary stimulus.

&gt;In 2012, the IMF finally admitted that it had underestimated how much budget cuts could hurt growth and recommended a slower pace for austerity policies. But its auditor said the IMF's own research showed this relationship even before the crisis.

Suddenly through no fault of your own your business falls deeply in debt. However no one wants to close you down, it's just a debt, equivalent to £20 per hour interest plus you'd like to pay down the total.

Do you sack workers and have less spinners?

If you do instead of making £100 per hour profit then paying £20 interest plus some towards getting the overall debt down you could sack 8 spinners and then flat out your business would only cover interest and you'd never get out of debt.

It doesn't make sense to reduce output during times of hardship.

Running down support for low income children, for disabled people, means that these people in the long term will tend to be considerably more burdensome on society. Instead of entrepreneurs young people may end up criminals and cost us money instead of making money for our society.

Investing in education, libraries, disabled support, reducing precarity and poverty are really good investments. We make money on providing adequate nutrition to growing children as they later turn into much more productive adults.

We're supposed to be about helping people, not looking down on them. 9 years ago really isn't that long ago, people weren't ok with being called trash then and they wouldn't be today. 

I'll trot it out as much as I want, I think people have a right to know. It's fine for people of any background to lead the party, Tony Benn was a Viscount for fucks sake, but I don't think a 'Jetrosexual' is someone I'd want leading the party. 

You've interpreted the ""We're all capitalists now"" speech in that way, but that's not the way I see it, for me he's ignoring the strong social democrat voice in the party and the even quieter socialist voice in the party. 

The Labour party is a broad church, so you can't brand everyone capitalists. If we lived under a communist one-party state are we all communists? I just don't trust him, I'd vote for Burnham whoever backed him, Ed Miliband was eventually backed by him and my local MP accepted a £1k donation from Blair. 

I'd vote for Burnham because I know he cares, he showed that when dealing with Hillsborough. Can I say the same for Umunna, the man who's aspirations seem to be above helping people? 

For me Blairism represents favouring mainly right of centre polices whilst preserving the NHS and offering a better benefits system than Labour. 

Miliband is seen as left and he basically endorsed workfare for fucks sake, I really think this goes far beyond left vs right.

Pros:

Much higher pay.

More space: can afford a much nicer house here.

People are friendly - even in the city, the New Yorker's legendary grumpiness is a bit of an act.  In our small town there's a real sense of community.

History (honestly!) and natural beauty.  I live in Sleepy Hollow (yes, *that* Sleepy Hollow) around the corner from the Old Dutch Church of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" fame.  In the winter when I wait for my train in I can sometimes see bald eagles hunting along the Tappan Zee (the lake where the Hudson is at its widest).

Public transportation is pretty good - not as clean as London's but much more reliable and cheaper.

Cons:

Healthcare is bonkers, even with good insurance.

Cost of living in the NYC area is insane, even with the higher pay.  Whilst income taxes are a bit lower than in the UK, our equivalent of council tax is $12,000 a year!  We do come out better off here overall though.

Food: it's pretty dire.  The closest really good restaurants we've found to NYC were in Montreal.  Supermarket produce is at best lack-lustre.  When we first moved we stayed on the Upper East Side (i.e. a pretty upmarket part of Manhattan) for a couple of months and were shocked at how dingy and run-down the local supermarkets were there.

Ings is a decent player, but what we really need is a true goalscorer and a top striker, especially since its now abundantly clear that we cannot count on Studge to be that striker. 

Milner is just a pathetic target. Kinda like Joe Allen a decent squad player who doesn't really excel at anything and whose only good description is that he is versatile and can play a lot of positions decently, or in other words he isn't actually good anywhere. How many of those players do we need?  

It would be nice if we actually had any idea what Brendan was aiming towards. Ideally we would know if he sought to be very direct and quick or strong and patient on the ball, are we going to pressure high or stay deep and wait on opponents, are we strong defensive squad or do we play aggressively and force the game. Rodgers had tried it all. I'd actually settle for knowing if he was going with 3 at the back, if we were looking at a 3 central midfield, if we we're looking to utilize winger or play Sterling and Coutinho as CAMs or whether we wanted to play a single or 2 strikers.

pinlock. Tinted drop down. Ski boot type ratchet strap

I went for the AGV k3-SV. I'll give a little resume:

very light, great styling, very comfortable, good finish on all the pads, easy to remove and clean, pinlock works brilliantly (i wouldn't consider anything else). Though I have heard it isn't track-preferred, the ratchet type strap is so convenient, it can be undone and taken off with one gloved hand. The inner visor has some critics regarding safety (arai don't even manufacture that mechanism and shoe have only just bowed to market demand), some visors don't come down far enough and aren't tinted dark enough, but I use it nearly every day even in the winter.

It's a bit of a noisy lid, though this depends on your height, speed and bike; if I'm traveling over 60 or for over 30mins I'll need to use ear plugs. The visor is quite flexible, this means it can flex against the neoprene seal (not nitrile like more expensive builds) and leak a little in heavy rain. Be careful, It can rock around if on a flat surface because of the 'beak'. Its frustrating having to push up a little spacer in the centre of the chin in order to 'crack the visor a little' otherwise it just closes firm.

Also on my list was a Shark s900 which didn't have pinlock but does have an air pump cheek cushion gimmik (the cheek cushions are the first to go 'flat' and don't fit like new) and is a bit more expensive. Also on my list was a HJC TR1 which has a double d strap and is a bit cheaper.

We spend over £50 billion every year, just paying the interest on our debt... This is more than we spend on 'defence' or 'public order &amp; safety'.

With more borrowing, there will come a point where paying the interest on our debts will be our countries highest expenditure. It is not sustainable to run a deficit for any country, it HAS to be our goal to run a surplus every year and pay down the debt.


How anyone can advocate running a permanent deficit is beyond me?

null,false,rough_outline,null,null,null,"Okay, so we have debt (money owed by the government) and either deficit (spending more than we receive in revenue) or surplus (generating more revenue than we spend).

We currently have a budget deficit, so our spending far outweighs the revenue we generate. The two important variables are simple, SPENDING and REVENUE.

Austerity is a term that means ""cutting spending"", so this addresses the SPENDING aspect of the budget. However, we can also approach the deficit from the alternate perspective, REVENUE, we can reduce the deficit by increasing revenue, how?

A simple answer would be through taxes. We can either increase current tax rates or create new taxes. Or what I'd like to see happen, stamp down on tax evasion (which is the illegal one and predicted to be well in the billions).

Also close loop-holes that makes unethical tax avoidance (this is the legal one) possible e.g. Google, Starbucks, Amazon. There is a 'Google Tax' which is supposed to stop companies diverting profits and avoiding paying tax.

In conclusion, you can reduce spending AND/OR increase revenue to reduce a budget deficit.

&gt;First, you claim that Conservatives are “racist, sexist, and homophobic”. This is the same party, you’ll remember, that had the first – and only – woman PM; that fielded more BME candidates in the 2015 election than the others; that the Conservatives introduced Gay Marriage and since the last general election had more LGBT MPs than the other parties. Indeed, from what I recall, in 2010 the Conservatives had more LGBT MPS than all the others put together. Claiming that they are racist, sexist, and homophobic is simply untrue – unless you mean that some Conservatives are, but then so are some Labour members.

I have friends who vote UKIP and friends who'd like to establish a socialist utopia. Wouldn't that be as stupid as unfriending people based on their religious beliefs?

If you don't accept people with different opinions to you then you'll just end up in an echo chamber circlejerk type situation where all of your peers just repeat your own opinions back at you.

&gt;  I try to remain engaged with such people in the hope that I might be able to change their views through debate.

I find this approach to other people abhorrent. ""I'm being your friend in the hope that at some point you will have the same opinions as me"". Fuck that shit.

Assuming any potential fine will not be counted against the club in its presentation of yearly accounts for FFP compliance checking, based on last years accounts ([page 15, £38mn revenue with parachute](http://www.scribd.com/doc/258474746/QPR-Holdings-limited-2014)) we should be looking at a combined transfer and wage spend of around £40-50 million, while the parachute payments are in place. That's actually not that bad considering the parachute payments are largely in place to cover expenses clubs are lumbered with following relegation - we're in this weird situation where a lot of the high earners are on their way out. The only headaches I can imagine are Onuoha, Hoilett, Caulker, Taarabt, Traoré and Sandro. Depressingly, given the timing of their signings, their pedigree (deserved or not) and their previous clubs, I can envisage this lot collectively costing upwards of 200k a week. That's a quarter of the hypothetical budget up in smoke right there.

I don't think we can be hit with an embargo on top of a fine, thankfully. If even such a thing were to happen, they'd have to bend the rules to allow us to actually build a team.

&gt;Acquiring players for salaries &gt;£15k per week.

First things first - they need to act quick to settle their new manager/head coach into the position. That man then needs to sit down with Ferdinand, and come up with a plan A and a plan B and then hit the market and buy accordingly. I wouldn't be going for a premium striker purchase like Fulham made with McCormack, I'd be looking to bring in a second striker from a Championship club and pitch him a deal as the number one choice up top. I'd probably set aside a larger chunk of the transfer kitty for this. I'd look to buy/sign the rest in from anywhere from League One to the Scottish Championship.

The next larger transfer fee I'd set aside is for a captain. Probably a central defender or holding midfielder. None of the retained players will be up to the job - we've seen that they just aren't talkers. Someone needs to be barking out orders to the defense or midfield.

For the rest I'm imagining a lot of cheap-ish unattached players signing.

&gt;Competing in the Championship against clubs that are executing well-developed long-term plans.

This is why I don't think we'll be competing for any honours next year. This year's Championship was intense stuff, with the top 8 teams playing for something down to the wire. On top of that, Burnley are going down with loads of money. Even Wolves are still due a final parachute payment. Then you're bumping up against the simple fact that most of the teams are bigger than us.

There were a lot of people there when I went for mine (over two years ago) and they didn't seem prepared for such a turnout. I think I stood waiting for over an hour, so unless they've made changes be ready for a wait.

Anyway, there will probably be about a dozen tables set up with a manager sitting at each. The actual interview is one to one and shouldn't last anymore than five minutes. It started with the interviewer giving a bit of an introduction to the job, then he asked me to tell him about myself. 

I think I maybe faced four or five questions. He asked what I thought the most challenging aspect of the job would be, and then read out a couple of scenarios and asked how I would respond. One was about what I would do if someone came to me in the Odyssey complaining about where they were seated. The other was about how I would react to a group of people becoming rowdy.

In either situation you want to let them know that you're willing to deal with problems yourself, but also know when to pass it on to your supervisor. Eventsec generally work on a three strike system. So if someone is doing something they shouldn't, you're expected to approach them and explain that they can't do it, if it persists you're supposed to warn them that if they do it again they'll be asked to leave, and if they do it a third time you find your supervisor and have them removed.

Also, in terms of attire, don't overdo it. When I went for my interview there was one guy out of about 50 wearing a full suit. He looked ridiculous. Most people wore jeans and a T-shirt/casual shirt. A few people were even wearing their work clothes.

Mate you can dig crap up on anyone. Burnham got in trouble with some in 2007 for comments about marriage and tax which were just like Tory policies. He was also linked with Wikipedia edits in 2013. There was also his refusal to set up a public enquiry into the Stafford Hospital deaths. 

I'm not saying that people would be ok with being called trash, I'm saying that comments made aged 27 cannot be held against someone forever, and you are quoting him out of context. It doesn't mean that he doesn't want to help people - you would be better looking at his actions as an MP to gauge that.

The 'jetrosexual' tag is something the Daily Mail have used, and I don't agree with it. Again, what is wrong with having a successful person as leader? If Benn was ok, why not Umunna? If you have earned your money, what it inherently wrong with spending it on travel and going out, if that's what you're into?

What does the social democrat and socialist voice of the party think about how public services are paid for? Do they think that it is better for people to be socially and economically mobile, or is it better for us all to be skint? 

&gt; I'd vote for Burnham whoever backed him

So why does it matter if Mandelson backs Umunna? Personally I think that if Ed Miliband was disliked by some for being a career politician, they'll use the same argument against Andy Burnham. 

His aspirations are above helping people? You've got this because he said that some nightclubs had trashy clientele? Please, have a read of some things that Umunna has actually said in speeches or articles he's written.

&gt;For me Blairism represents favouring mainly right of centre polices whilst preserving the NHS and offering a better benefits system than Labour.

in 2007 the government borrowed £37.7bn and reinvested £28.3bn into government led project, but in 2013 the coalition borrowed £91.5bn and reinvested £23.7bn. As well as between 2004 to 2008 labour borrowed a total of £148.8bn, and in 2008/09 borrowed £97.5bn. 

Then since 2010 the government has borrowed £572.5bn, and the national debt risen to £1.36 trillion from £0.53 trillion in 2008. Combined with government spending rising from £673bn in 2010 to £714bn in 2014, with the national debt rising from over 60% of the GDP in 2010 to over 80% in 2014, but yet the deficit fell from a high of £160.4bn in 2009 to £101.8bn in 2014. 

Presumably the deficit has fallen due to the government cuts and higher VAT, but with borrowing still outweighing that of the GDP, despite its rise of £2.309 trillion in 2008 to £2.678 trillion in 2013.

Not cut the GDP even further.  Debt should only become an issue when the economy is good.  Trickle-down economics and austerity experiments have failed time and again.  The evidence behind austerity was actually based on [flawed and incorrect](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/16/is-the-best-evidence-for-austerity-based-on-an-excel-spreadsheet-error/) analysis.

The growth is deceptive as the [UK isn't really doing that well in comparison to other countries like the US and France](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/britains-success-story/?_r=1).  It's easy to use GDP growth to create a misleading view of economic development. For example, a poor country with a GDP per capita of $2k can easily ""beat"" the US and Germany in GDP growth if it's GDP rises to $4k. 

The banker with a £1m mortgage isn't worse off than the homeless man with no debts.

The deficit is just the [amount by which the government's revenue is below it's spending](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/UK_GDP.png).  Most people don't understand that.  Deficits can be and have been easily manipulated.  The deficit was [increasing](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11177862/It-is-truly-shocking-that-our-already-huge-budget-deficit-is-still-growing.html) since the [coalition government](http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2014/09/britains-budget-deficit) took power, but fell the very quarter before the election, which is what the media obligingly reports.

Poor countries can have a low deficit, it just doesn't mean much.

The tories only focus on deficits/debt because they want to use it as an excuse to cut public services.  They've manipulated the deficit because it's easy to cheat on and makes them look good to people too clueless on economics to know better. It's the usual conservative tactic, cut until the service can't run properly and then claim it's a failure of the public sector and announce privatisation.",null,0,null,1431344654,null,0,1431344904,0,cr5e7qa,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5e7qa,null,t3_35ktwv,null,null,null,1432893060,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Building social housing is one example of spending that would stimulate the economy in a short time frame while also providing the secondary benefit of affordable housing for low income people in a way that the free market would not. It's killing two birds with one stone.

Do you like renting from private landlords? Or do you rent from them because there is no alternative? Do you want to stay renting for the rest of your life or do you want to save up so that some day you can get a home of your own?

I don't know why you're getting all offended. As if I'm suggesting you shouldn't be able to rent. Social housing isn't about removing your rental home. It's about providing people on low incomes with an affordable alternative so they don't spend all their money (or all the council's money in the form of benefits) on rent to private owners. Instead, the rent goes to the government to recoup the costs of building it, and since the goal is not to make a profit, this rent is much lower.

Maybe you like spending most of your pay check on rent which provides you with no personal asset value in the long run, but most of us don't find it fair that we can't afford houses because people with big capital come in and buy everything up to let before people who actually need houses can, then rent it to us at exorbitant rates.",null,0,null,1431344875,null,0,false,0,cr5ea4g,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5ea4g,null,t1_cr5dvqc,null,null,null,1432893091,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

&gt;The slogan of ‘ride me all day for £3’ whilst being a little tongue in cheek was in no way intended to cause offence to either men or women and, if the advert has done so then we apologise unreservedly. There has certainly been no intention to objectify either men or women.

&gt; Replacing Jobseeker's Allowance for 18-21 year-olds with a Youth Allowance time-limited to six months. After that, they will have to take an apprenticeship or traineeship or do community work to claim benefits

They don't want young people to grow up relying on handouts to survive. The longer you're unemployed, the harder it is to find work for two reasons.

1) employers will always ask why you were unemployed for that long
2) taking on an apprenticeship shows provocativeness. It also gives you skills specific to your industry, which you may not have picked up in your non related university degree.

As an employer, you see applicants who have gone to incredible lengths in order to gain experience and separate themselves from other candidates. A lot of the time they've chosen to work for free. Now, in no way am I condoning this and saying this should be the case, but in a tough and competitive job market you need to be proactive. 

I can't emphasis enough just how difficult it has become for the young to actually get work. Not just because of less jobs, but mainly because competition has become so fierce. If you're at home on JSA, there will always be someone out there who will take that non paid apprenticeship, and you greatly risk being left behind. Making you more likely to rely on JSA in the future. A vicious cycle.

Politically popular idea, terrible policy. It provides a structural gap that we can't address if we need to raise extra revenue so there's little room for flexbility. Increasing income tax from 40% to 40.5% is negible for the individual, but produce billions in tax which can be used for infrastructure, that can expand the economy much more than the 0.5% tax. Not worth it - it's just political showboating.

* **Invest an extra £8bn a year for the NHS by 2020**

Nice idea. I hope they require that it's spent on equipment or addressing shortages such as mental health/dental services rather than hiring more managers who manage other managers or contracting out to private firms that are coincidentally owned by Dave's mates.

* **Hold a referendum on membership of the EU by 2017**

The EU is vitally important to the UK (in so many ways which are undeniable facts) but I don't trust the British public to make the right decision. Nevertheless it is a democracy and we should proceed with this out of this principle.
 
* **Open 500 more free schools**

Effects yet to be seen. It takes disproportionate revenue outside of the current education budget, but the increased community involvement could lead to better results. If it works, then why not? 

* **Extend the right-to-buy scheme to housing association tenants in England**

It increases overall wealth, which is a good thing (more spending, more investment). But, the Tories are unlikely to reinvest in council houses further exacerbating the shortage. It's too short term-ish. I suspect it's an ideological narrative to get people off benefits, or get fucked.

* **Build 200,000 starter homes**

Good idea, but we need at least 240,000 per year just to keep up with growth. We should be building &gt;300,000 and increasing densification in urban areas rather than sprawling out.

* **Ensure all people who work 30 hours per week on the minimum wage pay no income tax**

Good idea. Minimum wage workers spend most of their money, so it almost all goes back into the economy with a multiplier effect. No deadweight loss occured with taxing it, then giving it back in benefits (bureaucracy costs)

* **Double free childcare allowance for three and four-year-olds to 30 hours**

Yes! It's virtually overlooked by most countries in the world as childcare is exorbitant. It'll raise participation of women in the workforce which increases national productivity.

* **Increase the inheritance tax threshold on family homes to £1m by 2017**

Ambivalent - it's more of a moral issue really. Causes structural funding issues, but as it's mostly working class/middle class people who benefit from this, most of the inheritance money is spent anyway which goes back into the economy with a multiplier effect. I wouldn't support lower taxes for the rich though as that creates dynasties and unfair advantages.

* **Make sure there are no above-inflation rises in rail fares until 2020**

I approached the white line at this point, have another look and decide I cant see her indicators cos of the sun, I'm gonna wait. At this point the car was about halfway over her white line so I stop.  She drives past, at the same time I look, lifesaver etc and move off.

null,false,negotiationtable,null,null,null,"&gt; I feel like you're oversimplifying it again, though. University-age people have a close proximity to their academic experience, so it's not surprising they form strong and passionate opinions about the areas they study. It's not really a case of thinking that no one else's viewpoint could be more valid, but more like a case of needing the other party to have a similar understanding of the theory they have in order to have a proper argument where both people have valid viewpoints to argue for.

Perhaps this might apply for you, certainly my background is not in philosophy and I haven't even read Das Capital.  So we can't have a discussion about Marxism.  But I've observed this in people who may be young but not academic, and I've observed it in people who are studying at a university but talking about topics unrelated to their study, so I'm not sure I'm oversimplifying. 

&gt; I've had my mind changed a lot over the last few months, but only by other people who are pretty experienced in what I study (philosophy).

That might be why people don't always respect the opinions of students.  Opinions that are fiercely defended but rapidly changing.  As the next few years go on, who knows what position you will espouse. :)  When I was a student (completely different field to philosophy) I was very much leftwing.  It seemed to me as clear as day that it was the only acceptable point of view, and it was impossible to relate to the right.  Now I find myself having moved over quite a few years ago away from the left.  However this isn't an argument against you, as you've pointed out, I haven't really got the first clue about Marx - although I really should read some.

&gt; In regards to the justification bit, you've misunderstood slightly. The Holocaust wasn't known to the Allies prior to the war

I believe the final solution policy was discovered in 1942.  Would you have invaded then? It's not like you have to decide war/no war at the same time the allies did.  There might have been a different point where you decided, enough is enough.  I'm sure you don't hypothetically advocate the killing of additional millions of people just to keep your argument, so I'm curious as to where your cutoff is.  You didn't seem to have any shades of grey.  If there is a bad thing, sometimes bad things have to happen to get rid of it.  Even the precepts of buddhism allow for this.

&gt; If you want to understand my ""rules,"" I'm a pretty strong follower of Marxist and Kantian philosophy, with some Confucian, Epicurean, existentialist, and post-structuralist elements here and there. I don't know how useful that is to you, though.

Thanks.  It tells me you should try some Hayek on for size! :)

""OMG! the other day I found out that a UKIP candidate lives a couple doors down from me. I was shocked! The fascist bitch.""

null,false,savardfaire,eng-GreaterLondon,Soufeest Lahndan,null,"&gt; Yes and how much of that is down to confidence that the UK government is committed to closing the deficit? Do investors look at the situation and say ""yes the bank is printing a lot but the government is getting its house in order"" otherwise do they say ""the bank is printing and the government is still borrowing, they're effectively monetising their debt"".

To me it seems investors have tended to look at the situation as ""This is the safest place to put my money."" Nobody expects the US or UK to fault and in practice they really couldn't, they can always print more money. This is the crux of the rush to buy sovereign debt, it's stable, safe and you'll get it back on time provided you don't buy it from Greece.

There's also the issue of what the borrowing goes on. I'm not sure anybody is looking to borrow to pay the welfare bill; I'd argue it shouldn't be cut because we're dealing with people's lives here *and* there's a multiplier effect with benefits money (since people on them are poor, and therefore will immediately inject that money back into the economy), but the UK shouldn't be selling bonds for it.

But if the UK sells bonds for infrastructure that's a much different idea. Roads, bridges and railways increase the flow of goods around the country, stimulating demand. Hospitals keep people healthier and in work. A massive housebuilding programme puts people at work, makes better use of existing land, and will help put more money in the economy as homebuyers will buying home improvements, and paying less money towards landlords (who tend to suck money out of the economy).

Then, once the economy is going, you run surpluses - like the first Blair government did - as people are working and paying in more tax, and you pay off some of that debt and more importantly don't take on any new debt for a while. The fiction here is that governments will never pay off all their debt, they'll just take on new debt, but they can in times of surplus go without taking any debt and as the economy grows their debt bill gets progressively smaller.

Thatcher had hit that in the late 80s, but taking out that one instance, that was as low as debt had been since the Asquith government of over 100 years ago.

2. They produce schemes which the rest of the population benefits from, whether that's getting to work more quickly, being able to afford a home, paying less of the tax budget to pay for temporary housing for homeless families in hotels etc, or attracting shoppers back out to the high streets because they're now nice places to be instead of shitholes, thereby rejuvenating local economies.

&gt;The problem with the idea of governments inflating their way out of a debt burden is that it does not work. Absent episodes of hyper-inflation, it is a strategy that has never worked. Government debt: GDP burdens tend to be positively correlated with inflation. Market mythology has created the idea that inflation will help reduce government debt ratios. The facts do not support the myth. OECD government debt rises as inflation rises. Meaningful reductions in government debt will require a low inflation future.

Culture and Values are a two way street. We see our values reflected in our culture (media; tv, art etc) and our culture is shaped by our values; queuing wouldn't happen in a culture that doesn't hold fairness as an important value, for example.

Values don't just appear either, they're shaped over the course of a nation or culture's history. Common law for example, originated in England, spread by the British Empire to a point where it's shared by parts of the world today; West and beyond. Doesn't make it any less a part of British values though does it?

You wouldn't say Pizza is any less Italian because Chicago developed their own style, would you? Or that Indian Cuisine is any less Indian because it's enjoyed and undeniably a part of British menus? 

The fact that values can be shared speaks nothing for how a culture perceives and executes itself with those values in consideration. If we have a British culture, we have British values.

Criticising right-wing policies that are not empathetic to the poor is not that farfetched an idea. I'm sure many conervatives didn't do purely for their own benefit (although ALL the many I do know tell me that is what it came down to), but it's also true that if there is a side that demonises the poor as ""lazy"" or not hard working enough, it will be the right. 

Personally, the reason I don't think there are many empathetic right wing voters is that even if you don't quite understand economics enough to realise austerity is frankly going to seriously damage many powerless people's lives, it's the complete lack of sacrifice from the well-off under this government. An insanely huge amount of the economic growth in the last 5 years has gone entirely to the 1%, while tax avoiders, whether rich people or corporations are not being targeted at all. Yes let's highlight the £1 billion or so in benefit fraud while their rich groupies find more and more exciting ways to set up tax havens. I think Vodafone's tax bill for the last year would deal with that by itself. Without the context of them just helping their rich friends, the fucking the poor doesn't completely put them in the light of dickishness. Which to me suggests that a certain portion of Tory voters are either misinformed or not empathetic. With a lot of the ones I know, it's the latter. Putting your needs above others is normal.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"On a whole season level, after reflection etc; sure, it's another good finish and an improvement on last season.  

Having gone through an experienced the whole season though, game to game, developments, injuries and everything - it could have been so much more. Especially that Feb - March bad spell and the games in the last few weeks. We could/should have racked up at least 5 more wins or 3 more wins and 2 draws in that time I reckon. Games like West Ham, Swansea, West Brom, Sunderland, Leicester should all have been at least the next result better (loss should have been draw, draw should have been win) and Tottenham should definitely have been a win when you watched the game.  

The performances being put in now don't inspire confidence. Yes the team is in a good position in the table, but everything else from the earlier parts of the season suggest it should have ended better. I'd still be happy with 6th if we managed to scrape a win and Tottenham didn't, but we're not doing ourselves any favours. The other teams above us (Tottenham, Liverpool, United) might well feel the same, but we were on course for our best season ever (and technically have done that) and it is just such a sour end to what could have been amazing.  

On top of that the way we are playing now, we look like a bottom half team struggling through match after match. We haven't looked the stronger team, which we had done so for most of our games this season even when ending up losing. Before it was lack of cutting edge, but now it's lack of anything. No passion, no desire, no good movement or plays or passes.  

Our second goal against Tottenham was about the only time since January (if not December) I remember us scoring a goal that didn't directly require a defensive mistake of some variety. It was just good, quick, attacking play. Mané carried it across, played it out to Long, he got a pin point cross in, met by a great header from Pelle. There were no glaring defensive errors or anything, just out-playing the opponent. And I barely remember that happening other than against anyone until back in January or earlier (Newcastle was a tough match but I think we won there on merit, Arsenal and United needed defensive errors but we still battled hard, before that it would be Everton when we last looked like a decent team).  

So all of that just means that while on reflection this can be seen as a successful season, the way we were playing, the we we are playing, and the frustration felt because we know we should be doing better, means that yes, there is a bit of negativity right now. Not least because as fans we can't do anything but hope for the next game to be better, and at present that just isn't happening.",null,0,null,1431348957,null,0,1431359987,0,cr5fmhf,null,t3_35jkia,null,t1_cr5fmhf,null,t3_35jkia,null,null,null,1432893723,null,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2,null

null,false,technicalthrowaway,null,null,null,"&gt; but what I don't get is that spending in welfare and health grow the economy and do not damage national debt.

Because happy and healthy workers are productive workers. Spending does impact borrowing, but it's negated with faster or higher repayment off of the new growth. E.g. we could do away with the NHS right now and save a massive amount of money. But chances are, people would first revolt, and then probably become ill, neither of which is good for productivity or growth. It's estimated working age ill-health costs us around £100 billion a year. If we could borrow and spend £100billion on the NHS this year, and reduce ill health (or at least, people not attending work due to ""ill health"") by 20%, then in 5 years, we've paid off what we spent and we've got a healthier and more productive economy as a result.

Also, with welfare, making sure people have money and can partake in society is a good thing. One person buying something from another person is basically one person paying another persons wage. If you get rid of welfare, you create people with less or no money, therefore, less people able to pay other people's wages, lower wages, lower productivity etc. As well as that, people without money also struggle to partake in other areas of society, such as education or staying healthy and happy.

&gt;I am a free market Conservative, and therefore begin with the presumption that the only things that should be in public ownership are things that have to be in public ownership, and generally things operate better if they are in private ownership and operate in a market. So the question is, do we need a BBC? And my answer to that has always been yes, because there are things which I think are in the public interest to have available for viewers but which would probably not be viable on a commercial basis, which is a definition of public service broadcasting. I mean people can argue, and my committees argue about what is public service broadcasting, but that is certainly one definition of public service broadcasting.

&gt;And it doesn’t just mean really, really sort of narrow programmes about, you know, Guatemalan hill tribes’ eating habits or whatever, I mean it does extend into high quality drama, quite risky material, certainly arts and culture. I mean news and current affairs at the core, religion, education, children ...

&gt;Is there a public service argument for Strictly? Debatable. Is there a public service argument for putting out Strictly at roughly the same time as ITV is running X Factor? No. The one thing in my view the BBC should not be thinking about is ratings, but they do because of the licence fee. That’s the problem.

&gt;I’m against the licence fee because it’s very regressive, it’s very expensive to collect, you get these ridiculous letters sort of threatening you with having your fingernails pulled out if you don’t admit that actually you’ve got a television hidden somewhere.

Also, you seem to favour austerity, but your justifications don't all make sense to me.

You give 4 bullet points of ""reasons against austerity"" and 7 bullet points justifying austerity. However, your first 4 points justifying austerity can be summarised as socio-political instability, therefore, austerity is safer. But your explanation doesn't really explain why austerity is better suited for times of instability. Also, many people I've spoken to (read: ""I'm not an expert, but I heard this..."") have suggested that borrowing and stimulus was used with much success in post WWII Britain, which I would have thought was a far less stable period than we're in now? What are your thoughts on this?

On top of that, you seem to focus on the value of interest rates being one of the more important factors in the stimulus vs austerity argument, you then go onto say interest rates are at an all time low, yet still conclude that austerity is the right approach?

Just to be clear, I'm not disagreeing with anything you say here.

The only thing is, it's a bit larger than the Fiesta and the Polo. It's more comparable with the [Ford Focus](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/ford/focus/hatchback/review) or the [VW Golf](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/volkswagen/golf/hatchback/review). The other good-value contender in this category is the [Kia Cee'd](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/kia/ceed/hatchback/review) with it's seven-year warranty. We'd probably recommend the Hyundai over those, too, but if you're really only going to the station and back then you might be better off with something smaller like the [i20](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/hyundai/i20/hatchback/review) or even the [i10](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/hyundai/i10/city-car/review)!

As you're doing short trips, you should go for the petrol engines. There's a 1.4 and a 1.6 - neither of them are quick. Avoid the diesel because it'll cost you more in the long run, and if it's only a five-minute journey it won't get up to temperature. Stick with the manual gearbox as well, because the auto isn't great and will increase your fuel economy considerably.

One of the good things about Hyundai is the 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty. For £10k you'll be able to find cars that still have a few years' warranty left on them - useful peace-of-mind. Our readers have generally said that the [i30](http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/hyundai/i30/hatchback/review) is pretty reliable, and that the pre-paid service deals are good value.

In terms of where to buy it, we'd recommend looking for an Approved Used model through the Hyundai main dealer network.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate.  It's a measure of the interest you pay on money borrowed on the card (loans and other credit products will also typically quote APRs).

The calculation of APR is (more or less) standardised so you can use it as a way of comparing costs of borrowing.  All other things being equal, the higher the APR figure the more expensive a product is.

As credit cards go 18.9% is fairly middling.  That said credit cards are generally an expensive way to borrow - if you need to borrow money you can probably find a cheaper way to do it.

That said as /u/grodecki already explained you don't have to pay any interest at all when using a credit card.

Pretty much every credit card has an interest free period for purchases.  If you pay the monthly statement in full by the specified date you will pay no interest.  This, generally, is the smart way to use credit cards.  Also most card providers allow you to set up a direct debit instruction to clear the account automatically. This is generally a good idea since it removes the risk that you will forget (although you do have to make sure there's enough money in your bank account at the relevant time).

Note that I said ""purchases"" above.  It is also possible to use a credit card in an ATM to withdraw cash.  This is referred to as a ""cash advance"" and almost all cards will charge interest on cash advances immediately, and possibly add other charges as well.

Someone that votes Tory is not, likely, *actually* a Tory, they're just convinced by their arguments. Just like buying an ice cream doesn't mean you'd support an ice cream van mowing down a lolly pop lady (weird analogy, I know).
Voting UKIP isn't the same as being a black shirt in the Nazi party and voting Tory doesn't mean you *personally* are going to impose savage cuts.
One of the problems I have with representative democracy, as opposed to a participatory system, is that the voting distances people from the decisions they make.
Its hard to associate a vote for a political party (or even a bill) with the actual implementation of something.
And, at the other end democracy is often used as a justification for people doing something they know is wrong. 

If your objective is to remain ideologically pure then ignoring conflicting view points should be your objective. However, my objective is to take away the Tory base by *shock horror* actually convincing people of my position.
This is hard when the Daily Mail literally has old people too scared to leave their house out of fear that they'll get attacked, but most of the people that are exposed to this propaganda should be seen as victims, not the perpetrators. 
In my view, anger and a sense alienation are perfectly acceptable responses to the modern world.
However, blaming immigrants and those on benefits is not a justified position.
Its a tough battle, but if you pick the side of a unified human race fighting for equality, justice and the planet then you can't have picked a harder battle.

For the first half of the season in particular the team was more than the sum of its parts, we were absolutely punching above our weight. Teams like Liverpool, Spurs and Everton fail to get into the champions league regularly and look at the squads they've had, we've kept pace with them all along and Everton have had a disaster. For Southampton to have even had a sniff of champions league was borderline absurd.

We don't have a Kane, a Coutinho, an Erikson. If you take a hypothetical average of the squad depth/ quality we're hardly better off than the likes of Swansea or Everton or even West Ham but we've beaten all of them and played much better over the course of the season.

I think the dips in form this season and last season are just the result of a team playing out of their skin for so long finally succumbing to physical and more importantly mental exhaustion. The fact that teams with stronger squads like both Manchester sides, Liverpool and Spurs are all having patchy form in the run in just shows how difficult it is for any side to play to their best for a whole season.

It's taken performances worthy of Team of the Year nominations from half the quad to get where we are, and not many players can maintain form like that for 38 league games plus cups. Meanwhile out of the 6 teams above us at least half of them are there just from their players playing at their expected level.

From the perspective of the UK gov't, the currency issuer, it's running up debt.

An immigrant coming from outside the EEA under UK rules had a harder time and paid more under Labour in the 00s than they would under Thatcher in the 1980s. The only thing that became liberalised that I know about was the primary purpose rule.

People call for an Australian style system, and for people from outside the EEA there already is one. If someone say from Japan, the US, Brazil, or so on wanted to move here on the basis of their skills, they'd likely have a hard go of it without having a PhD or a shortage skill. Or lots of money to invest. 

I'd like to see how many non-EEA nationals come here either through marriage or relationship to non-UK EEA national or after gaining permanant EEA residency. It's that difference that is important in talking about immigration and understanding what can and should be done to further regulate it. Throwing further regulations on a system that is already not contributing to net migration in any great deal or putting people like you through even further bureaucracy in trying to get your fiancée here isn't really an answer that is going to make anyone happy.

For a purely historical point of view you want to look back to at least 1694 with the foundation of the Bank of England and, essentially, the beginning of a British national debt for the latest start of saying that the economy is propped up be debt. Even before that earlier monarchs had personally ran on a line of credit on behalf of the Kingdom but as they had a habit of refusing to pay it was never as favourable or as stable a foundation for an economy. The expulsion of the Jews in the 13th Century, for example, was an example of Edward I refusing to pay his debts. 

IANE but when you consider that the monetary economy (shares, derivatives etc.) is several magnitudes larger than the estimated value of all goods and products you might think that growth is fictional. However somehow through fiscal magic of some sort the discrepancy is supposedly a driver of real growth.

First off. Are lesbians not gay? Perhaps gay specifically means homosexual man, I thought it meant homosexual person but hey-ho I might be wrong there. 

The main one is the inclusion of transexual, and now these other ones that I can't even figure out. Nothing wrong with transexuals, they should have equal rights with the next person. But, if I was a gay man, I'd be thinking ""Hold the bus here, how come I'm lumped together with the Ts and the Bs and the Ls, as though we're just a big homogenous group?

Your ROI would be 168% instead of 200%. If that's a tragedy, what should the people who are completely unable to get on the property ladder say?

&gt; Most people move house to buy a bigger place, or at least a similar place elsewhere if they move for work.

Most people can't buy a house, much less a big place or one that is close to work.

&gt; most people right up the chain have mortgages so they simply can't afford to absorb the taxes and drop the price they are asking for their house.

Most people have mortgages that are an 18% capital gains tax away from going under? in that case Britain would be completely economically buggered because of overleveraging, but neither the BoE nor anyone else has sounded the alarm on that, despite the data being public.

But that works both way. The rich own businesses which employ a lot of people. The rich give people jobs. They actively invest into society on-top of paying taxes. Why should they pay more then you do just because they've worked hard to be successful?

&gt; they can afford to pay more without having much if any detriment to their lives.

Just because they can afford it doesn't make it right. They worked hard to be where they are - and yes many will have inherited their fortune, but those that built their business from scratch shouldn't be penalized so much for doing so.

Zimbabwe owed heaps of USD, more than the economy could ever hope to produce. Mugabe tried printing ZWD to buy USD to repay that debt, buying up all USD for sale for ZWD on fx markets and tanking the ZWD in the process which could never hope to recover.

By comparison, the UK gov't owes only pounds. Two things about that : the UK isn't going to run out of pounds in the first place. It's not going to be denied them by markets, it's not going to be ""forced to print"". Secondly, even if it did, that's only QE.
